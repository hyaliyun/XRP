The Jan Lokpal aimed to deter corruption, compensate citizen grievances, and protect whistle-blowers. The prefix Jan (translation: citizens) signifies that these improvements include inputs provided by \\"ordinary citizens\\" through an activist-driven, non-governmental public consultation. The word Lokpal was coined in 1963 by L. M. Singhvi, a member of parliament during a debate. Inspiration The demand for a Jan Lokpal was inspired by the Hong Kong Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). and taken forward by a group of activists that came to be styled by the media as Team Anna. Key features of bill Some important features of the bill are: # To establish a centre anti-corruption institution called Lokpal, supported by Lokayukta at the state level. # As is the case with the Supreme Court of India and Cabinet Secretariat, the Lokpal will be supervised by the Cabinet Secretary and the Election Commission. As a result, it will be completely independent of the government and free from ministerial influence in its investigations. # Members will be appointed by judges, Indian Administrative Service officers with a clean record, private citizens and constitutional authorities through a transparent and participatory process. # A selection committee will invite short-listed candidates for interviews, the video recordings of which will thereafter be made public. #Inquiry has to be completed within 60 days and investigation to be completed within six months. Lokpal shall order an investigation only after hearing the public servant. # Losses to the government by a corrupt individual will be recovered at the time of conviction. #Whistle-blowers who alert the agency to potential corruption cases will also be provided with protection.  Campaign for the Jan Lokpal Bill  The first version of the Lokpal Bill drafted by the Government of India in 2010 was considered ineffective by some anti-corruption activists from civil society,who came together to draft a citizen's version of the Lokpal Bill later called the Jan Lokpal. Public awareness drives and protest marches were carried out to campaign for the bill. Public support for the Jan Lokpal Bill draft gathered steam after Anna Hazare announced that he would hold an indefinite fast from 5 April 2011 for the passing of the Jan Lokpal bill. To dissuade Hazare from going on an indefinite hunger strike, the Office of the Prime Minister directed the personnel and law ministries to see how the views of social activists could be included in the bill. On 5 April, the National Advisory Council rejected the Lokpal bill drafted by the government. Union Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal then met social activists Swami Agnivesh and Arvind Kejriwal on 7 April to find ways to bridge differences over the bill.However, no consensus could be reached on 7 April owing to several differences of opinion between the social activists and the Government. =Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill 2011 in Parliament= On 27 December 2011, Lok Sabha Parliament winter session passed the Government's Lokpal as the Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill 2011. Before passing this bill, it was introduced in Lok Sabha with key amendments moved. During the 10-hour house debate, a number of opposition parties claimed introduced bill was weak and wanted it withdrawn. Key amendments that were discussed but defeated were following: * Including corporates, media and NGOs receiving donations * Bringing CBI under the purview of Lokpal Amendments that the house agreed upon were: * Keeping the defence forces and coast guard personnel out of the purview of the anti-graft ombudsman * Increasing the exemption time of former MPs from five to seven years This bill was then presented in Rajya Sabha where it hit a logjam.No vote on Lokpal, Rajya Sabha adjourns abruptly Criticisms of the Jan Lokpal Bill =Na√Øve approach= The activist bill was criticised as being na√Øve in its approach to combating corruption. According to Pratap Bhanu Mehta, President of the Center for Policy Research Delhi, the bill \\"is premised on an institutional imagination that is at best na√Øve; at worst subversive of representative democracy\\". The very concept of a Lokpal concept received criticism from ex Human Resource Development minister Kapil Sibal in that it would lack accountability, be oppressive and undemocratic.Jan Lokpal a Frankenstein's monster: Sibal, Abantika Ghosh, TNN, 30 June 2011, NEW DELHI, The Times of India =Extra-constitutional= Kejriwal rejected the claim of Lokpal being extra-constitutional with the explanation that the body will only investigate corruption offences and submit a charge sheet which would then be tried and prosecuted through trial courts and higher courts, and that other bodies with equivalent powers in other matters exist. The bill also lists clear provisions for the Supreme Court to abolish the Lokpal. Despite these clarifications, critics feel that the exact judicial powers of Lokpal are rather unclear in comparison with its investigative powers. The billJan Lokpal Bill version 1.8, annahazare.org requires \\"...members of Lokpal and the officers in the investigation wing of Lokpal shall be deemed to be police officers\\". Although some supporters have denied any judicial powers of Lokpal, the government and some critics have recognised Lokpal to have quasi-judicial powers. The bill also states that \\"Lokpal shall have, and exercise the same jurisdiction powers and authority in respect of contempt of itself as a High court has and may exercise, and, for this purpose, the provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 (Central Act 70 of 1971) shall have the effect subject to the modification that the references therein to the High Court shall be construed as including a reference to the Lokpal.\\"Full text: The Jan Lokpal Bill, CNN-IBN, 7 April 2011Full details Jan Lokpal Bill ‚Äì Draft , Saturday, 9 April 2011, e-news4u.comLokpal Bill, Jan Lokpal Bill version 1.8, Review of proceedings and decisions by Lokpal is prevented in the bill by the statement \\"...no proceedings or decision of the Lokpal shall be liable to be challenged, reviewed, quashed or called in question in any court of ordinary Civil Jurisdiction.\\". As a result, how the trials will be conducted is unclear in the bill, although the bill outlines requiring judges for special courts, presumably to conduct trials that should be completed within one year. The critics hence express concern that, without judicial review, Lokpal could potentially become an extra-constitutional body with investigative and judicial powers whose decisions cannot be reviewed in regular courts. =Scope= The matter of whether the Indian Prime Minister and higher judiciary should or should not be prosecutable by the Lokpal remains as one of the major issues of dispute. Anna's own nominee for co-chairing the joint panel Justice Verma, the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, has expressed his constitutional objections for including the Prime Minister and higher judiciary under Lokpal. According to him, \\"this would foul with the basic structure of the constitution\\". =Criticism from the Director of CBI = The CBI in a presentation before the Standing Committee of the Parliament, has strongly argued against the vivisection of the CBI and merger of its anticorruption wing with the Lokpal, noting that this would seriously cripple the core functioning of the CBI and reduce it to irrelevance. An organisation built over last 60 years comprising competent professionals should not be subsumed under Lokpal. CBI officers concede that in some sensitive political cases there is of course interference from the government, but in respect of an overwhelming majority of cases CBI functions, unfettered and uninfluenced by extraneous considerations. For this reason there is an ever-increasing demand for CBI investigation from all over the country in respect of important cases.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History Broken Hill station opened on 15 July 1919 when the line opened to Menindee. Until extended further east in 1927, the section was not connected to the rest of the New South Wales Government Railways network.Broken Hill Station NSWrail.netBroken Hill Railway Precinct NSW Environment & Heritage Broken Hill had a railway until 1888, with the Silverton Tramway connecting the city to Cockburn and Adelaide via Sulphide Street station. Broken Hill developed into an important location with the mines having provided a regular source of traffic. Broken Hill was the border station between New South Wales and South Australia, with interstate trains changing locomotives up until the 1990s in the era of state owned railway networks.\\"Broken Hill Today\\" Railway Digest July 1985 pages 190-191 Services Until its cessation in November 1989, Broken Hill was the terminus for the Silver City Comet from Orange.\\"The Official Last Comet\\" Railway Digest February 1990 page 55 It was also the terminus for Australian National's Silver City Limited from Adelaide from December 1986 until 1990.\\"Western Report\\" Railway Digest February 1987 page 52 Today, Broken Hill is served by NSW TrainLink's weekly Outback Xplorer to and from Sydney. NSW TrainLink also operate a daily road coach service to Dubbo. Journey Beyond Rail Expeditions' weekly Indian Pacific also calls at Broken Hill.  Description  The heritage-listed main station building is a type 18 design, constructed of brick, steel and glass with a clock tower in 1957. The original 1919 station survives a short distance away, disused and derelict. The former stationmaster's residence at 265 Wills St has been privately owned since 1997. Neither building forms part of the modern station's heritage listing.  Heritage listing  The new Broken Hill station is an excellent example of the application of the \\"modern style\\" to railway architecture. Very few sites of this scale were constructed at this time so this is a rare example. It was also one of the most expensive station buildings constructed reflecting political needs of the time. The juxtaposition of the now derelict first station building opposite, in pre cast concrete construction which was a standard country station building highlights the contrast between the new and the old buildings. The scale of the newer building belies the potential needs of the station and it is closely aligned to the major Victorian station buildings in design intent (but not in style or construction). Broken Hill railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare. This item is assessed as scientifically rare. This item is assessed as arch. rare. This item is assessed as socially rare.

Born in Rochdale, part of Greater Manchester, he studied at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and had a role as Abanazer in a 1963 performance of Aladdin in the Royal Tunbridge Wells Opera House, which led to a 15-year-long legal battle with presiding agent, Alan Gale, over commission and the displacement of a large quantity of nose putty. Later, he played small parts in several TV shows, including a role as a postboy in the soap opera Compact and, after a dry spell, a non-speaking role as a Dalek operator. Seeing this as a particularly low point in his career, Summerton joined Hazel Malone's talent agency, where he met David Bowie, who was similarly attempting an acting career, and apparently expressed cynicism in Bowie's musical abilities.

Plot  The film is based upon the events surrounding what became known as the 'Watseka Wonder'. Using period photographs, dramatic recreations, and interviews with subject experts, it addresses what is allegedly the first well-documented and recorded spirit possession story in America of 1877, and the subsequent recorded \\"possessions\\" suffered by Lurancy. Beginning in 2006, and using the assistance of members of the Studio Nine class of Watseka Community High School, The Possessed was shot on locations in Watseka, Illinois, in the actual homes of, and including interviews of, the remaining family members of Lurancy Vennum. The filmmakers included a repeat of an original 100-year-old s√©ance, but were able to include modern measuring instruments. They also used footage of individuals themselves alleged to be possessed. The film dramatically recreates the alleged events. After years of violent and self-destructive behavior, a young Mary Roff from Watseka, Illinois was committed to an asylum in Peoria, Illinois, and on July 5, 1865, she died. Twelve years later, a Watseka girl named Lurancy Vennum began exhibiting the same behavior as had Mary. When Asa Roff, a devout spiritist, heard of the incident, and believing that the spirit of his deceased daughter Mary has possessed Lurancy, he convinced the Vennum family to not commit their own daughter. Lurancy Vennum moved in with the Asa Roff family in 1878 and lived with them for several days. There she was examined by a spiritist, Dr. E. W. Stevens, who wrote about the case, and upon whose journals the film was based.

When he left to take charge of Adelaide's Botanic Garden in 1891, his son Nicholas was appointed curator of the Darwin Botanical Gardens in his place.Kraehenbuehl, D. K. \\"Holtze, Maurice William (1840‚Äì1923)\\" Australian Dictionary of Biography Online, accessed 20 March 2011 Holtze studied at Hildesheim and Osnabr√ºck before serving an apprenticeship in Hanover, where he subsequently worked for four years in the Royal Gardens. He spent two years in the Imperial Gardens of St. Petersburg before emigrating in 1872 to Melbourne, then to Darwin, Northern Territory. While in Darwin (then called Palmerston, later Port Darwin) he made trial plantings of a large number of tropical plants of potential economic importance: rubber, rice, peanuts, tobacco, sugar, coffee, indigo and maize. He supplied the sugarcane tubers for the Cox's (later Cox) Peninsula sugarcane venture in which B. C. DeLissa and W. H. and G. T. Bean had a large interest. He was involved in a private agricultural enterprise in Darwin's Jungle Creek and Palm Creek region, known as \\"Holtze Jungle\\", later \\"Holmes Jungle\\". Holtze sent a large number of botanic specimens from the Darwin area and nearby islands, many of which had not been previously described, to Ferdinand von Mueller. In Adelaide, succeeding the great Dr Schomburgk as curator, he did much to make the Botanic Gardens an attractive place for the general public to visit, a novel policy at the time. He established lakes populated with water- lilies and lotuses, which became quite famous.Dr Holtze I.S.O. The Register 4 June 1913 p.13 accessed 20 March 2011 He retired in 1917 and died in 1923 at American River on Kangaroo Island in South Australia at the home of his daughter. He is buried in the Penneshaw Cemetery on Kangaroo Island along with his wife, Evlampia (n√©e Mizinzoff), who died 5 July 1937. A son, Alexis Leopold Holtze (1883 ‚Äì 26 November 1938), was horticultural correspondent for the Mount Barker Courier, and editor of Garden and Field, later manager of radio station 5AD. He was killed in a single-vehicle car crash. Another son, Vladimir or Wladimir \\"Wallaby\\" Holtze (c. 1869 ‚Äì c. 1963), was a linesman with the Overland Telegraph Department (later Postmaster-General's Department) from 1881, and stationed at Powell Creek, Daly Waters and for a time as postmaster at Tennant Creek.

The name \\"Luzon Volcanic Arc\\" was first proposed by Carl Bowin et al. to describe a series of Miocene to recent volcanoes due to eastward subduction along the Manila Trench for approximately 1,200 km from the Coastal Range in Taiwan south to southern Mindoro in the Philippines. Islands that form part of the arc are the Eastern Coastal Range of Taiwan, Green Island, Taiwan, Orchid Island, Kaotai Rock, Mavudis or Y'ami Island, Mabudis, Siayan Island, Itbayat Island, Diogo Island, Batan Island, Unnamed volcano Ibuhos, Sabtang Island, Babuyan, Didicas, Camiguin Island. At the south end it terminates on Luzon.The Times Atlas of the World, 1990, plate 19 The geochemistry of a number of volcanoes along the arc have been measured. There are five distinct geochemical domains within the arc (Mindoro, Bataan, Northern Luzon, Babuyan, and Taiwan). The geochemistry of the segments verified that the volcanoes are all subduction related (e.g., strong niobium anomalies and calc-alkaline characteristics). Isotopes and trace elements show unique geochemical characteristics in the north. Geochemical variations northward (Babuyan segment) were due to the subduction of sediments derived from the erosion of continental crust from China and Taiwan. There is a distinct increase in strontium isotopic ratios with latitude northward. This supports the conjecture that the variations were due to an increasing \\"crustal\\" component in subducted sediments as the continental blocks in the north were approached (China and Taiwan). The sediment thicknesses increased toward the north along the trench. The geochemistry and tectonic setting of the southern Luzon arc has been studied in detail. The geochemistry suggested that continental crust (probably from sediments) played an important role in the Macolod corridor and the Mindoro segments. Crustal collision had occurred in the south between the North Palawan-Mindoro crustal block and perhaps sediment contamination was derived from this region. This substantiates preliminary early isotope and trace element studies on the central Luzon arc Further work was done on the northern Luzon arc by McDermott et al. who found systematic variations in an assortment of isotopes with latitude not only in the lavas analyzed over the 500 km section of the arc but also in sediments along the trench. The only way to explain the latitudinal variations was through the addition of an increasing input of terrigenous sediments toward the continental regions in the north China and Taiwan During the Middle Miocene, 16-15 Ma, activity started in Taiwan. Batan Island volcanics are dated at 9.36 Ma, while north of Luzon, the volcanic islands are younger than 6.5 Ma.

The engine has a spinning disk with curved blades. Once fuel and air enter the engine, the rotation of the disk creates shockwaves that compress the mixture. When ignited, the burning mixture expands, pushing against the blades, causing them to spin. The spinning of the disk itself opens and closes intake and exhaust ports. The proposed concept was called a radial internal combustion wave rotor.  Background  Wave rotors utilize shock waves to transfer energy between a high-energy fluid to a low-energy fluid, thereby increasing both temperature and pressure of the low-energy fluid (also called pressure wave machines or pressure exchangers).  Operational principles  As with all heat engines, the efficiency of a wave disk engine is governed by the temperature difference between the hot and cold sides (see Carnot's theorem). Compared to a conventional piston engine (reciprocating engine), a wave disk engine works at higher peak temperature, which theoretically makes it more efficient. The design also works without a cooling system, saving weight. Compared to turbine based systems, the rotational speed and the rotor-blade temperature of the wave disk engine is lower, which creates lower stress on materials, and consequently less demanding requirements for materials, leading to cheaper manufacturing and maintenance costs. Earlier wave rotor implementations were mainly axial flow, where the scavenging process of returning hot compressed air back into the turbine is complex. The wave-disc engine uses a radial and circumferential flow, using centrifugal forces for scavenging. Curved channels provide greater length for the same disc diameter compared to straight channels, allowing the travel times of the waves to be tuned properly.  Current status  The wave- disk engine has the potential for better energy efficiency compared to conventional internal combustion engine designs and can potentially save weight. Possible applications include charging batteries in hybrid vehicles, which could reduce weight by about .Shockwave-Generating Wave Discs Could Replace Internal Combustion Engines Popular Science Magazine, 03.16.2011, Accessed March 2011Shock wave puts hybrid engines in a spin, Helen Knight, New Scientist, 15 March 2011, Accessed March 2011 It promises to be up to 60% efficient, 30% lighter, and 30% cheaper to manufacture than an equivalent conventional piston engine, and to reduce emissions by 90%. Michigan State University and Warsaw Institute of Technology researchers claim to have a prototype wave-disk engine and electricity generator that could replace current backup generator technology of plug-in electric hybrid vehicles. The research team is led by Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering Norbert M√ºller and has been given $2.5 million funding from the United States Department of Energy's ARPA-E program. M√ºller's team hoped to have a vehicle- sized 25 kilowatt (33 hp) wave disc engine/generator ready by the end of 2011. As of January 2013, the project is looking into commercialization of the technology.

Life He was the younger brother of John Barwick, and like him was educated at Sedbergh School, and St John's College, Cambridge, where he was a foundation scholar. He was appointed by Bishop Matthew Wren to the fellowship at St John's, in the gift of the Bishop of Ely, but could not be admitted because of the troubled times. He was driven from Cambridge by the First English Civil War. Barwick became tutor to Ferdinando Sacheverell, of Old Hayes in Leicestershire. He returned to Cambridge in 1647 to take his M.A. degree, and studied medicine. In 1651 he was at Worcester, meeting with Charles II of England, and receiving tokens of his favour; and like his brother he was a royalist supporter. In 1655 he received his M.D. degree, and in 1657 took a house in St. Paul's Churchyard. Here he was joined by his brother John, who daily read the proscribed service of the Church of England in the presence of a few royalists. About this time Peter married a Mrs. Sayon, a merchant's widow and a kinswoman of Archbishop William Laud. He was elected fellow of the College of Physicians 26 June 1655. At the Restoration he was made one of the king's physicians in ordinary, and was known in his profession particularly for his treatment of smallpox and all sorts of fevers. In 1661, Gilbert Sheldon, bishop of London, and the other bishops, deans, and archdeacons, met at his house, and proceeded to St Paul's Cathedral to open the first session of convocation for the revising of the Book of Common Prayer. When the Great Plague of London broke out in 1665, he was one of the few physicians who stayed; and he is mentioned by Nathaniel Hodges in his account of the plague Loimologia for his services in London, while attending the daily service at the cathedral and working with the clergy there. Though the plague could not drive him from his home, the Great Fire of London did in 1666: his house was burned down with St Paul's, and he moved to the neighbourhood of Westminster Abbey. Here he lived for many years, on good terms with his neighbour Richard Busby, doing charity work and writing. He was censor of the College of Physicians in 1674, 1684, 1687, and ‚Äòelect‚Äô from 26 March 1685 to 6 November 1691. In 1694 his eyesight entirely failed him, and he gave up his practice; but he lived on for eleven years and died 4 September 1705. Works He supported William Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood, and he is said to have written one of the best contemporary treatises on the subject. Barwick is now remembered for his life of his brother John, the dean. He began it in 1671, writing it in Latin, chiefly, it is said, for the sake of inserting the Latin disputation which his brother wrote for his D.D. degree.The thesis was ‚ÄòThat the method of imposing penance and restoring penitents in the primitive church was a godly discipline, and that it is much to be wished it was restored.‚Äô To the ‚ÄòLife‚Äô he added an appendix vindicating the royal authorship of Eikon Basilike. The ‚ÄòVita Joannis Barwick‚Äô was published in 1721 by Hilkiah Bedford, who also wrote an English translation of the work published in 1724, with notes. The manuscript of the life, with papers used in it, was deposited in the library of St John's College, Cambridge. Family Peter Barwick and his wife Anne had one daughter: Mary (pictured). Peter Barwick and his wife Anne had one daughter: Mary (1645-1723). On 14 Jan 1678 at Westminster Abbey, Mary married Ralph Dutton (1630-1720), who later that same year was created a baronet by Charles II (on 20 Jun 1678). Through Mary, Peter was the ancestor of the Barons Sherborne, the Earls of Lichfield, 3rd Creation, the Earls Howe, 2nd Creation and the Earls of Dartmouth.E.K.

In Korea he served as a company commander in the 24th Infantry Division and in 1967, in the Republic of Vietnam, on his first tour he served as the commanding officer of the 5th Battalion, 7th Cavalry. He has also played a major role in numerous United States Special Forces operations. Early life and military career Vaught grew up in Conway, South Carolina. A multi-generational native of the state, he has been identified as a direct descendant of Francis \\"Swamp Fox\\" Marion. However, this is in dispute, as there are no known direct descendants of Marion. He graduated from high school in 1943 and then was enrolled at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina. During this time, with World War II being fought by Allied forces in two theaters, the draft was altered so that college students were eligible. In 1944, Vaught was one of those drafted by the United States Army, though he was able to graduate and become a member of the Citadel's class of 1946. In the Army, he was commissioned an officer in 1945. After the war, he served three and a half years in Germany. Korean and Vietnam Wars After his duty in Germany ended, Vaught had a relatively short stay back in the U.S. before he was sent to Korea, where he was involved in the fighting against the communist forces of North Korea and China. He saw combat on several occasions after his landing at Pusan and the subsequent advance north towards the Yalu River. During this time, he was injured twice. In 1967 during the Vietnam War, he was sent to South Vietnam, where as the battalion commander of the 5th Battalion, 7th Cavalry, he played a key role in the liberation of Hu·∫ø city during the Tet Offensive of 1968. He also helped the besieged Marines at Khe Sanh until the North Vietnamese Army retreated after failed attempts to take the base. Vaught was later injured in an auto accident which resulted in him being evacuated, in a full body cast, to Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Although the Vietnamization policy was thought of as a failed concept, Vaught was a proponent of the policy and was a valuable asset to it throughout his second tour of Vietnam. Later life After Vietnam, Vaught continued his career with the Army and was eventually promoted to Major General, serving at The Pentagon as Director of Operations and Mobilization for the Army. Perhaps his most notable role was during Operation Eagle Claw, the infamous failed rescue mission of hostages in Iran, where General Vaught served as the overall commander of the operation in 1980. Eight service members died and four were injured in the operation when one of the helicopters on the mission collided with a transport aircraft in the remote Iranian desert. Although President Carter went on television the next day to announce the failure of the mission and to accept the blame, Congress and the Pentagon launched inquiries to determine the reasons for the tragedy. The Pentagon probe was handled by a board of three retired and three serving flag officers representing all four services; it was led by retired Admiral James L. Holloway III. The commission's report listed 23 areas \\"that troubled us professionally about the mission-areas in which there appeared to be weaknesses. The major criticism was of the \\"ad hoc\\" nature of the task force, a chain of command the commission felt was unclear, and an emphasis on operational secrecy it found excessive. The commission also said the chances for success would have been improved if more backup helicopters had been provided and if a rehearsal of all mission components had been held. James B. Vaught served his final tour of duty as the Commanding General of the Combined US/South Korean forces. He resided in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina after his retirement in 1985.  Death  Authorities found his body in an Horry County, South Carolina pond. While Vaught died of asphyxia due to drowning, the coroner stated that his body also showed signs of cardiac disease. He was 86.International Drive in Myrtle Beach, SC, is to be named after him. He is survived by his wife Florence Vaught and several children and many grandchildren.His great-granddaughter  References   External links  *https://web.archive.org/web/20111228053824/http://www.rescueattempt.com/id8.html *http://www.citadelalumni.org/dcal/dcal.php]*HighBeam *http://www.citadel.edu/pao/newsreleases/archives/sy00-01/Corps_day_awards2001.html *https://web.archive.org/web/20110304010411/http://www.specialoperations.com/Operations/Eagle_Claw/Default.htm *https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/117453739/james-benjamin-vaught 1926 births 2013 deaths United States Army generals American army personnel of World War II American army personnel of the Korean War American army personnel of the Vietnam War The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina alumni People from Conway, South Carolina Accidental deaths in South Carolina Deaths by drowning ","title":"James B.

He taught at Harvard his entire career, starting in 1950 as an instructor in the departments of history and government. He held the Leroy B. Williams Chair in History and Government from 1975 until he retired in 1987. He was president of the Association for Asian Studies in 1979. Educational background Schwartz was born in East Boston and grew up in a poor family, but graduated from Boston Latin, a school known as a gateway to higher education. He attended Harvard College as a day student on scholarship at a time when poor or Jewish students found the atmosphere unwelcoming. He graduated from Harvard in 1938 with a degree in modern languages, with an honors thesis on Pascal and the XVIIIth century \\"philosophes\\".WorldCat record for Schwartz's thesis He started a career in school teaching before studying Japanese in the United States Army during the Second World War and working on code-breaking. After the war he earned an M.A. in East Asian studies at Harvard and went on to gain a Ph.D. there, studying under John King Fairbank. Career Schwartz was a member of the Harvard faculty, teaching in Cambridge until he retired in 1987.

Schwartz () and published by the Harvard University Asia Center. Scholarly work and contributions Schwartz's early works studied the relations between political thought and action. His first book was Chinese communism and the rise of Mao published by Harvard's Russian Research Center in 1951.Held in 1546 academic libraries.WorldCat record for Chinese Communism and the Rise of Mao The Introduction says he will investigate the movement's ‚Äúideas, intentions, and ambitions‚Äù over a \\"limited period,‚Äù from 1918 to 1933, and only ‚Äúin terms of its doctrinal frame of reference and of its internal political relations,‚Äù not ‚Äúthe ‚Äòobjective‚Äô social and political conditions which have encouraged its growth or in terms of its effect on the masses.‚Äù The Communists came to power ‚Äúon the crest of a popular movement‚Äù but this did not mean that they were the ‚Äúmystic embodiment of the popular will.‚Äù Future decisions ‚Äúwill be made by the political leaders and not by the surging masses.‚Äù To say that leaders would automatically continue to express the needs and aspirations of the masses would be to ‚Äúconstruct a myth designed to sanction in advance all their future activities.‚Äù His second monograph, In Search of Wealth and Power, turned to the relations between tradition, modernity, and identity seen in the work of Yan Fu (1854-1921), best known as the translator and interpreter of John Stuart Mill, Charles Darwin, and Herbert Spencer. Earlier scholars had not thought Yan of interest, assuming that he had simply misunderstood these influential thinkers and their late 19th century liberalism and individualism. But Schwartz used the choices that Yan Fu made in his translations to reflect on the ways in which the pursuit of wealth and power in the West had subverted individual values, even within its own liberal tradition. In 1968 he published a collection of essays following developments of the 1950s and 1960s: Communism and China; ideology in flux (Harvard University Press).Held in 929 libraries according to WorldCat WorldCat record for Communism and China He edited the symposium Reflections on the May Fourth movement: a symposium.

The wheel arrangement of two leading wheels on one axle, two powered driving wheels on one axle, and two trailing wheels on one axle provided more stability and enabled a larger firebox than the earlier 0-2-2 and 2-2-0 types.Hamilton Ellis, The pictorial encyclopaedia of railways, Hamlyn, 1968, p.37. One of the earliest examples, Adler, the first successful locomotive to operate in Germany, was a Patentee supplied by Robert Stephenson and Company in component form in December 1835. Other examples were exported to the Netherlands (notably Arend in 1839), Russia and Italy.Ellis, The pictorial encyclopaedia of railways, p.37. Another, Le Belge, was the first steam railway locomotive built in Belgium, constructed in 1835 by John Cockerill under license from Stephenson's company. By 1838 the type had become the standard passenger design by Robert Stephenson and Company.Science Museum, The British Railway Locomotive 1803-1853, H.M.S.O, 1958, p.13. Daniel Gooch oversaw the building of two Patentee style Locomotives, originally intended for the New Orleans Railway at 5ft6 Broad Gauge. When the American order was withdrawn, the North Star and Morning Star were sold to the Great Western Railway and converted to Brunel's 7ft Broad Gauge, forming the basis of the GWR Star Class Locomotives.

Early life The son of Dr. Thomas Hodges, vicar of Kensington, he was born there on 14 September 1629. A king's scholar of Westminster School, he obtained a scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1646. In 1648 he migrated to Oxford, and was appointed by the parliamentary visitors a student of Christ Church where he graduated B.A. 1651, M.A. 1654, and M.D. 1659. While there he took part in the activities of the Oxford Experimental Philosophy Club. Hodges took a house in Walbrook, London, and began practice there. He was admitted a candidate or member of the College of Physicians 30 September 1659. The plague time When the bubonic plague raged in London in 1665, Hodges remained in residence, and attended all who sought his advice. During the Christmas holidays of 1664‚Äì5 he saw a few doubtful cases, and in May and June several certain cases; in August and September as many as he could see by working hard all day. He rose early, and took a dose of anti-pestilential electuary as large as a nutmeg. After transacting his household affairs he entered his consulting room. Crowds of patients were always waiting, and for three hours he examined them and prescribed, finding some who were already ill, and others only affected by fear. When he had seen all he breakfasted, and visited patients at their houses. On entering a house he had a disinfectant burnt on hot coals, and if hot or out of breath rested till at his ease, then put a lozenge in his mouth and proceeded to examine the patient. After spending some hours in this way, he returned home and drank a glass of sack, dining soon after, usually off roast meat with pickles or other relish. He drank more wine at dinner. Afterwards he saw patients at his own house, and paid more visits, returning home between eight and nine o'clock. He spent the evening at home, never smoking, but drinking old sack till he felt thoroughly cheerful. After this he generally slept well. Twice during the epidemic he felt as if the plague had infected him, but after increased draughts of sack he felt well in a few hours, and he escaped without serious illness. In recognition of his services to the citizens during the plague, the authorities of the city granted him a stipend as their authorised physician. Later life The College of Physicians recognised the merit of his book, and elected him a fellow 2 April 1672. In 1682 he was censor, and in 1683 delivered the Harveian oration (not printed). When censor he gave the college a fire-engine. His practice did not continue to increase, he became poor, was imprisoned in Ludgate Prison for debt, and there died 10 June 1688. He was buried in St Stephen's, Walbrook, and a bust and inscription were to be seen there. Works Pages from the 1656 translation of Aurea Themis of Michael Maier. He was a contributor to the Oxford volume of verse issued in 1654 to celebrate the peace with the Dutch. In 1666, he published an attack on quacks, ‚ÄòVindici√¶ Medicin√¶ et Medicorum, an Apology for the Profession and Professors of Physic.‚Äô The 1656 translation of the Aurea Themis of Michael Maier was by Nathaniel Hodges and Thomas Hodges (his father or his brother). Loimologia, the 1720 translation. In 1671, he completed an account of the plague, which was published in 1672 as Loimologia, sive Pestis nuper√¶ apud Populum Londinensem grassantis Narratio Historica. Hodges was an observer both of symptoms and the results of treatment. Bezoar, unicorn's horn, and dried toads he tried and found useless, but he recognised the merit of serpentary as a diaphoretic, and of hartshorn as a cardiac stimulant. He described pericarditis in a case of plague. A translation of Loimologia by Dr. John Quincy was published in 1720.

The national park lies within the Hunter Valley Important Bird Area. South of the national park is the separate Werakata State Conservation Area.

On 1 March 1676 in Darmstadt, she married Henry, who at the time of the marriage ruled Saxe-Gotha jointly with his six brothers.

After Henry's death, a dispute erupted among his remaining brothers over the inheritance of Saxe-R√∂mhild. This dispute was settled definitively in 1765. Henry loved his wife very much. He always called her \\"Marielies\\", and had several luxurious buildings built in her honor, including a cave house called \\"Marie Elisabeth Delight\\". They had no children.

The settlement was founded in ca. 1723 by Frenchman, Philip Francois Renault, during the French colonial period. St. Philippe was strategically located near the bluffs that flank the east side of the Mississippi River in the vast Illinois floodplain known as the \\"American Bottom\\". The village was located three miles north of Fort de Chartres. Because of many decades of severe seasonal flooding, St. Philippe and the fort were both abandoned before 1765. After the British takeover of this area following their victory in the Seven Years War, many French from the Illinois country moved west to Ste. Genevieve, Saint Louis, and Missouri History =New France= In 1719, Philip Francois Renault arrived from Picardy to the area. A friend of the French King Louis XV, Renaud was given a large tract of land for mining purposes. However, he was not as successful as anticipated. He founded the village of St. Philippe along the Mississippi and soon his village was producing a surplus of crops, which was sold to the towns and villages in the southern part of French Louisiana. They especially needed the grain of the Illinois Country. The town was strategically located along fertile Mississippi River bottomland. Surpluses from the productive cultivation by habitants later helped supply critical wheat and corn to New Orleans and other lower Louisiana Territory communities. They did not have the climate to grow such crops. St. Philippe in the Illinois Country D'Artaguette, an inspector in the country in the early 18th century, wrote: > \\"This country is one of the most beautiful in all Louisiana. Every kind of > grain and vegetables are produced here in the greatest abundance.... They > have, also, large numbers of oxen, cows, sheep, etc., upon the prairies. > Poultry is abundant, and fish plentiful. So that, in fact, they lack none of > the necessaries or conveniences of life.\\" Because habitants did not practice fertilization, the soil became exhausted. In addition, an increase in population meant there was not sufficient land for everyone. Some villagers moved to the west side of the Mississippi and founded Ste. Genevieve about 1750, in present-day Missouri. They quickly created an agricultural community with characteristics similar to St. Philippe.Carl J. Ekberg, Colonial Ste. Genevieve: An Adventure on the Mississippi Frontier, Gerald, MO: The Patrice Press, 1985, p. 25 =British rule= Following their victory in the French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Years' War), the British gained possession of French lands east of the Mississippi, excluding New Orleans. The Treaty of Paris was signed in 1763; however, the British did not arrive in force until 1765. To avoid British rule, many of the town's French residents moved across the Mississippi River to towns such as Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis in what was now, via the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau, Spanish Louisiana. Additionally, King George III's Royal Proclamation of 1763 designated all the land west of the Appalachians and east of the Mississippi as an Indian Reserve. He tried to prevent settlers entering from the then-British Colonies. =American Revolution= During the American Revolutionary War, George Rogers Clark captured Prairie du Rocher for the colonies in his campaign that resulted in the capture of Vincennes, Indiana. Reportedly, his campaign caused some of the remaining French settlers to emigrate to the Spanish-controlled territories west of the Mississippi, leaving relatively few in Prairie du Rocher. Many of the subsequent settlers of the area had been members of Clark's campaign, or were related to someone who was. They were convinced of the promise of the area by tales of the fertility of the soil in the area now called American Bottom. Environmental impact =Flooding= The cutting of the forest trees and deforestation of the shoreline, on both sides of the Mississippi River, caused the river banks to collapse, which continuously flooded large tracts of land, including the village of St. Philippe. =Fort de Chartres= Fort de Chartres was a French military fort constructed in 1718, about three miles south of the colonial settlement of St. Philippe. It was a trading post established at the site of an Indian village. In the 20th century, the fort was designated as an Illinois state historic site and partially reconstructed. Due to state budget cuts, in the fall of 2008, the fort was closed to visitors until the following spring. Since the fall of 2009, the fort has again been staffed and open to visitors. =Village abandonment= Because St. Philippe was within the floodplain of the American Bottom and suffered severe seasonal flooding, the village was eventually abandoned before 1765, as was Fort de Chartres.

History The memorial was the result of a grassroots effort to get the Israeli government to recognize civilian victims of terror as it does soldiers who fall in the line of duty.Sivan, Emmanuel. \\"George Mosse and the Israeli Experience\\" in What History Tells: George L. Mosse and the Culture of Modern Europe, Stanley G. Payne, David J. Sorkin, and John S. Tortorice, eds. University of Wisconsin Press, 2004, pp. 253-254. Until the establishment of the memorial, bereaved families erected their own memorial plaques and markers at the places where terrorist acts had occurred. After successfully pressuring the government to pay pensions to families of terrorist victims in the 1970s, the campaign lobbied for the inclusion of a memorial ceremony for civilian victims of terror during the official state Remembrance Day ceremonies at the Mount Herzl military cemetery. This idea was strongly opposed by the families of fallen soldiers, but a compromise was reached in 2000 to hold the memorial ceremony for victims of terror two hours before the ceremony for fallen soldiers. The two ceremonies continue to be held separately. Design Close-up of plaques listing names of terrorist victims from 2000 onwards. The Victims of Acts of Terror Memorial, arranged as a series of stone walls, was designed by architects Moshe and Rita Oren. It was constructed by the National Insurance Institute and the Ministry of Defense in cooperation with the Israeli Terror Victims' Association, the legal representative of terror victims and their families. The design is intended to depict \\"the stand of the Jewish People against those wishing to demolish its existence\\". The memorial is located midway between the military graves and the grave of slain Prime Minister of Israel Yitzhak Rabin. A total of 78 black marble plaques embedded in the stone walls are engraved with the names of Jewish and non-Jewish victims of terrorist attacks in Israel. The plaques are grouped according to the following time periods: 1851-1919; 1920-1929; 1930-1939; 1940-1947; 1947-1949; 1950-1959; 1960-1969; 1970-1979; 1980-1989; 1990-1999; 2000-2009; October 2009 to the present. Plaques 1 through 60, which memorialize civilian victims of terror who died by the end of 1999, were permanently engraved on the eve of Yom Hazikaron 2006. The remainder of the plaques, memorializing civilian victims of terror who died from 2000 onwards, are temporary markers which will be permanently engraved following the approval of the victims' families. Controversy According to Israel political scientist Meron Benvenisti, the memorial is more of an attempt to reshape collective memory than an accurate list of \\"victims of terror\\". One named victim, for example, was murdered by Arabs in 1851 after he petitioned the Ottoman rulers to remove them from their Old City home in advance of the construction of the Hurva Synagogue. Others were Jewish victims of the 1946 King David Hotel bombing perpetrated by the Irgun, a Jewish paramilitary group. The determination of inclusion as a victim of a ‚Äúhostile act‚Äù is determined by the National Insurance Institute, Israel's social security agency. Stamp issue The memorial was depicted on a 4.70 NIS Israeli stamp issued in February 2003. Pope Francis visit On May 26, 2014, in between visits to Mount Herzl and Yad Vashem during his 3-day Middle East trip, Pope Francis agreed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's suggestion to detour to the Victims of Acts of Terror Memorial, where the Pope touched the memorial wall and prayed. Netanyahu showed the Pope the memorial plaque to the 85 victims of the 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires, where the Pope was born.

His paintings, illustrations and etchings, undertaken for himself and on behalf of many of the foremost architects of the Victorian period made him \\"the Piranesi of the Gothic Revival.\\"Mordaunt Crook et al. 1984, p 13 Life Haig was born at Katthamra farm in the parish of √ñstergarn on the island of Gotland. His parents were Axel H√§gg, a landowner and timber merchant, and Anna Margaretha Lindstr√∂m. He was taught drawing and watercolor painting by Per Magnus Arvid S√§ve (1811-1887) who ran a private drawing school at Visby. Haig was apprenticed as a shipbuilder at the government dockyard at Karlskrona. In 1856 he went to Glasgow for a further period of training at a firm of Clydeside shipbuilders. But his interests had turned to architecture and in 1859, he undertook a new apprenticeship as a draughtsman in the offices of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. After seven years there, he launched himself as an architectural artist. Haig's illustration for the Summer Smoking Room at Cardiff Castle The middle years of the nineteenth century saw an explosion in the practice of architectural competitions. The wealth generated by the empire and The Industrial Revolution created the necessary conditions for a vast expansion in civic construction. Commissions for government offices, town halls, churches for private benefactors, railway termini were all put out to tender and competing architects required draughtsmen to illustrate their plans. In 1866 Haig met architect and designer William Burges (1827‚Äì1881) when Burges retained him to illustrate his designs for the Royal Courts of Justice in The Strand.Axel Haig and the Victorian Vision of the Middle Ages page 16 Haig produced a series of watercolour illustrations that were \\"an immediate sensation.\\" The competition's winner, George Edmund Street is said to have remarked, \\"I wouldn't mind being beaten by drawings like those.\\" Floda Church in S√∂dermanland In 1875, Haig made study trips to Italy and Sicily, which resulted in a multitude of drawings and watercolors of mainly medieval architecture. Haig and Burges continued in partnership until the latter's death in 1881. In that time they produced some of the most spectacular medieval visions of the Victorian Gothic Revival.

In a review of his work published by RIBA in the year of his death, Maurice Adams wrote that \\"his architectural draughtsmanship ranks without a doubt amongst the foremost of his time and his graphic capability remains unique.\\"RIBA Journal Volume XXVIII (1921) Haig was mostly a resident of England, but spent the summers at the family farm on Gotland. Floda Church at S√∂dermanland, Sweden was rebuilt and underwent restoration between 1885‚Äì1888 on the basis of his drawings. Haig also designed All Saints Church in Grayswood, Surrey. It was built between 1901 and 1902 in a style described variously as Surrey Vernacular or \\"13th-century [Gothic] with Arts and Crafts elements\\". Haig is buried in the graveyard. The church is a Grade II listed building.

The band produced two albums and enjoyed limited success during the final part of the hair metal explosion in the early 1990s, before disbanding. All the band members went on to work with other hard rock recording artists Lance Bulen (Puzzle Gut and Kingbaby). Vocalist and guitarist Kelly Keeling performed with Michael Schenker Group and Trans-Siberian Orchestra.  History  The group was originally composed by Lance Bulen (vocals), Kelly Keeling (guitars and keyboards), Keith Harrison (bass) and Harold Knappenberger III (drums). The group began their career under the name Voices, later changed to Cheetah, then to Meridian, finally changed to \\"Baton Rouge\\" which Ahmet Ertegun asked for, so some roots from Louisiana would be part of the name and because of the similar name of the band Melidian. The band relocated to Los Angeles in 1987, experiencing changes of personnel and roles within the group. Keeling assumed the role of frontman after producer/songwriter David Foster sat down with Lance and said that Kelly's voice for the songs fit your band better. After that inspiring conversation, Bulen became lead guitarist backing vocalist, bassist Bryan Scott and drummer Corky McClellan. The band, still under the name Cheetah, signed to MCA Records and produced a demo and a song with Jack Ponti, before Scott departed and was replaced by Scott Bender. In 1989, after only six shows in Los Angeles clubs, Atlantic Records put the band under contract . With the collaboration of the two songwriting members of the band Surgin‚Äô, Jack Ponti and Vic Pepe (the first had worked on the first album of Bon Jovi), Baton Rouge began rehearsing material for their first album. Meanwhile, in 1989, Keeling, Bulen, and Ponti, contributed some songs for the album Point Blank of the German hard rock band Bonfire. The debut album of Baton Rouge, Shake Your Soul , was published in 1990 with the production of Jack Ponti. The album saw the participation of several guest musicians, from drummer Frankie LaRocka of Company of Wolves and the band of John Waite, to Joey Franco, drummer of Good Rats and Twisted Sister, to Bobby Gordon and Randy Cantor on keyboards. The track \\"There Was a Time (The Storm)\\" was co- written with Jaime Kyle. Keyboard player David Cremin, is credited in the album and is pictured on the back cover but he did not participate in the recordings. Shake Your Soul peaked at No. 160 in the U.S. charts. Baton Rouge underwent a change of label and another change of formation for the recording of their second album, with the addition of former Keel guitarist Tony Palmucci in place of Cremin. Their second album Lights Out on the Playground was released in 1991 and included the song \\"Desperate\\", written by Jack Ponti and also previously recorded by Babylon AD on their album with the same name. The album did not enter the American charts and was a commercial failure. Keeling was very unsatisfied with the music Baton Rouge had been playing and of the band itself, so when he received the offer to enter in Blue Murder, a group founded by guitarist John Sykes (Tygers of Pan Tang, Thin Lizzy, Whitesnake), he accepted the proposal. Consequently, Baton Rouge disbanded in 1991. = After the dissolution = Kelly Keeling performed with Blue Murder until 1994 and then collaborated with former Europe guitarist John Norum (1995‚Äì1997), Michael Schenker (1999), Erik Norlander (2003), Dokken (2004) and George Lynch (2004) for both their tours and solo efforts. He also pursues a solo career as musician and vocalist. In 2006 he became the vocalist of the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Lance Bulen collaborated with Paul Sabu and Dave Spitz, former bassist of White Lion and Black Sabbath, in a quartet called Insomnia (1993‚Äì1994) and in 1996 founded the band Puzzlegut, with former member of XYZ Patt Fontain. Bulen finally formed the band KingBaby in 2004, where he is the lead vocalist and guitarist. He has also worked as touring and session musician with many rock artists during his career after Baton Rouge dissolution. Tony Palmucci was a session and touring player for Twisted Sister's vocalist Dee Snider solo projects. In 1997, Jack Ponti returned to record production after a few years hiatus with a new Baton Rouge album based on some old demos and recruited Keeling as vocalist for the project. Ponti played guitars and keyboards on the album, with the help of bassist Pat Schick, keyboard player Guy Daniel and drummer Camus Celli. In September 1997, the German label MTM Music published the album under the title Baton Rouge. Two of the tracks included on the album were written in collaboration with Stan Bush and \\"Love's a Loaded Gun\\" was a cover of the song composed by Ponti, Vic Pepe and Alice Cooper, which appeared on Cooper‚Äôs album Hey Stoopid of 1991. The reformed Baton Rouge lasted only for the recording the album. In fact, Keeling never considered the group as a reunion of Baton Rouge. The original line-up of Baton Rouge reunited in 2009 to perform at the Rocklahoma rock music festival held in Pryor, Oklahoma. A permanent reunion of the band never materialized.

History =Overview= 1980 Yamaha XJ650 Maxim I The 4 cylinder, air-cooled, twin-cam 650cc engine is housed in a cross-braced duplex steel tube frame. Yamaha made the engine narrower by locating the alternator behind the cylinder block and above the gearbox rather than on the end of the crankshaft. The Maxim had shaft drive.Cycle, 1982 Contemporary reports praised the Maxim's performance and braking. Criticism was aimed at engine vibration and under-damped suspension. Succeeding Maxim models were refinements; the 1982 Maxim 650 had a more comfortable handlebar, an air-adjustable fork, and a more luxurious seat. A turbocharged variant, the XJ650 Seca Turbo, was featured in the 1983 James Bond film Never Say Never Again. Cycle magazine said in 1982 \\"Three years later, after the wide proliferation of special styling, it's easy to forget what a landmark bike the Maxim was...The 650 was striking, controversial, sensational, and wildly successful in showrooms. Other companies have produced bodacious knock-offs of the 650 Maxim, imitations that suffer from excess. It's too bad the Maxim was obscured when manufacturers blanketed the market with cruisers. A decade down the road, the Maxim may well be a genuine classic of the 1980s ‚Äî a bright idea that stood the test of time.\\"Quote-Cycle, 1982 =Engine/Drivetrain= Yamaha 653 cc DOHC-8 valves, inline-4 Yamaha shaft drive The 1980 to 1983 XJ650 Maxim combined an air-cooled, 653 cc DOHC two valves per cylinder transverse inline- four engine and shaft drive. The engine employed a one-piece crankshaft with plain bearings and placed the alternator and starter behind the engine to minimize width. A chain drives the two overhead camshafts, which used shim- and-bucket adjustment. A second chain drives the oil pump located in the crankcase, while a third (Hy-Vo) chain spins the alternator. The power unit is fed by four Hitachi constant velocity carburetors and lit by electronic ignition. Four-into-two headers extracts the waste gases, which exit through two shortened mufflers. Hypoid gears and a shaft turns the rear wheel, with the shaft housing forming the left side swingarm.

Its name comes from the Japanese term \\"tatoeba\\" (), meaning \\"for example\\". Unlike other online dictionaries, which focus on words, Tatoeba focuses on translation of complete sentences. In addition, the structure of the database and interface emphasize one-to-many relationships. Not only can a sentence have multiple translations within a single language, but its translations into all languages are readily visible, as are indirect translations that involve a chain of stepwise links from one language to another. The aim of the project The aim of the Tatoeba Project is to create a database of sentences and translations that can be used by anyone developing a language learning application. The idea is that the project creates the data, so programmers can just focus on coding the application. The data collected by the project is freely available under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license. Content As of June 2019, the Tatoeba Corpus has over 7,500,000 sentences in 337 languages. The top 10 languages make up 73% of the corpus. Ninety-eight of these languages have over 1,000 sentences. The top 14 languages have over 100,000 sentences each. Tatoeba is also the current home of the Tanaka Corpus, a public-domain series of about 150,000 English‚ÄìJapanese sentence pairs compiled by Hyogo University professor Yasuhito Tanaka first released in 2001, and where it is undergoing its latest revisions. The statistics for all languages are found at . History Tatoeba was founded by Trang Ho in 2006. She originally hosted the project on Sourceforge under the project name \\"multilangdict\\". Interface Users, even those who are not registered, can search for words in any language to retrieve sentences that use them. Each sentence in the Tatoeba database is displayed next to its likely translations in other languages; direct and indirect translations are differentiated. Sentences are tagged for content such as subject matter, dialect, or vulgarity; they also each have individual comment threads to facilitate feedback and corrections from other users and cultural notes. As of early 2016, more than 200,000 sentences in 19 languages had audio readings of different quality. Sentences can also be browsed by language, tag, or audio. Registered users can add new sentences or translate or proofread existing ones, even if their target language is not their native tongue. However, it is preferred that users translate into their native or \\"strongest\\" language and add sentences from their native language rather than translating into or adding from their target language.http://en.wiki.tatoeba.org/articles/show/quick-start This means that the text corpus is by far not free of errors, every user can translate sentences even if they have no idea about this specific language ‚Äì due to the number of sentences it is not possible to check any sentence if it is correct or not. Furthermore, as of late 2019 even the terms of use of the website are not translated. Translations are linked to the original sentence automatically. Users can freely edit their sentences, \\"adopt\\" and correct sentences without an owner, and comment on others' sentences. Advanced contributors, a rank above ordinary contributors, can tag, link, and unlink sentences. Corpus maintainers, a rank above advanced contributors, can untag and delete sentences. They can also modify owned sentences, though they typically do so only if the owner fails to respond to a request to make the change. Database structure A simplified diagram of Tatoeba's underlying data structure. Tatoeba's basic data structure is a series of nodes and links. Each sentence is a node; each link bridges two sentences with the same meaning.

He published in 1717 a ‚ÄòLexicon Physico-medicum,‚Äô dedicated to John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu, who had just been admitted a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London. It is based on the medical lexicon of Bartolomeo Castelli of Messina (died 1607), published at Basle in 1628, and went through eleven editions, of which the last two appeared respectively in 1794 and 1811 (greatly revised). His ‚ÄòEnglish Dispensatory‚Äô (1721), of which a fourth edition appeared in 1722 and a twelfth in 1749, contains a complete account of the materia medica and of therapeutics, and many of the prescriptions contained in it were popular. In 1719 he published a scurrilous ‚ÄòExamination‚Äô of John Woodward's ‚ÄòState of Physick and Diseases.‚Äô A reply, entitled ‚ÄòAn Account of Dr. Quincy's Examination, by N. N. of the Middle Temple,‚Äô speaks of him as a bankrupt apothecary, a charge to which he made no reply in the second edition of his ‚ÄòExamination‚Äô published, with a further ‚Äòletter to Dr. Woodward,‚Äô in 1720. In the same year he published an edition of the Loimologia of Nathaniel Hodges, and a collection of ‚ÄòMedico-physical Essays‚Äô on ague, fevers, gout, leprosy, king's evil, and other diseases. In 1723 his ‚ÄòPr√¶lectiones Pharmaceutic√¶,‚Äô lectures which had been delivered at his own house, were published with a preface by Dr. Peter Shaw. * Pharmacopoeia officinalis et extemporanea : or a compleat English dispensatory in four parts .

Noted for her hits such as \\"Beyond The Reef\\" and \\"Hawaiian Hospitality\\" in the late 1940s, in the 1950s and later embarked upon a successful media career as a radio DJ for her own show KTRG and presenting her own TV cooking show Napua's Kitchen in the 1960s. She made two guest appearances in the popular series Hawaii Five-O and also presented the Aloha Week and Kamehameha Day hula shows. Biography Stevens was born on August 31, 1918 in Hawi, North Kohala, Hawaii. She was a descendant of Charles Stevens, an American whaler who arrived in Hawaii in the 1840s. She was born one of six children of Robert Naea Stevens and Julia Kaaoaolahilahiokeohokalole Bell. Her name Napua was a shortened version of her name Kawaiala Kao'ionapuaopi'ilani which means \\"the perfumed water\\" and \\"the finest flower in the bouquet of Pi'ilani. She was of Scots and Native Hawaiian ancestry and was a descendant of ancient Native Hawaiian kings. In 1949 she recorded Beyond The Reef on the Bell Records label (like her other hits), written by Canadian Jack Pitman. It was later recorded by Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley and The Ventures. Other notable hits include \\"Hawaiian Hospitality\\", \\"I Want to Learn to Speak Hawaiian\\", \\"Pretty Red Hibiscus\\", \\"May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii\\" and \\"What Aloha Means\\". In the hit \\"Hawaiian Hospitality\\" she sings of meeting a handsome dark-eyed local on Waikiki beach and his Hawaiian hospitality. In \\"I Want to Learn to Speak Hawaiian\\" she sings of her desire to learn the Hawaiian language so \\"she can say the sweetest things and do the hula too.\\" In 1948 she joined the Aloha Week organization and was responsible for producing and narrating hundreds of hula shows, with performers such as Daddy Bray, Bill Ali'iloa Lincoln, Vickie I'i Rodrigues (her cousin) and others. In the 1950s she hosted her own radio show KTRG and presented her own TV cooking show Napua's Kitchen in the 1960s for eight years. Stevens later made some appearances as an actress, including two episodes of Hawaii Five-O (1969‚Äì1973). She also narrated television coverage of the annual Kamehameha Day parade for years into the 1970s for KITV. Stevens was also talented at the crafts and in 1971 authored a book The Hawaiian Quilt which was an instruction/guide manual to the Hawaiian quilt. Personal life In her prime she was described as being particularly physically attractive with one person commenting that \\"Napua was the loveliness of all Island girls in one, a ripe- mango beauty with raven hair and ivory skin\\". She was a cousin to Bill Ali'iloa Lincoln, another noted hula musician. Several people related to Napua Stevens are also successful musicians or entertainers in Hawaii. She died on January 7, 1990 at the age of 71.

He is a leg-spinner who made his international debut for the West Indies in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.http://www.cricketworld.com/bishoo-named- as-world-cup-replacement-for-bravo/27026.htm Bishoo was named as ICC Emerging Player of the Year in 2011, but lost his place in the team through a combination of loss of form and competition brought on by Sunil Narine and Shane Shillingford. Domestic career Bishoo is a leg spinner who has risen through the ranks since his debut in the 2008 season. He cut his teeth at the first-class level and courted immediate success, snaring four five-wicket hauls, and ten in one match, in his first couple of seasons. His attacking style of bowling had a major impact in the 2010 Caribbean T20 where he finished with ten wickets in four games at the mean average of 8.20, conceding just 5.12 runs an over. He was named in West Indies A team for unofficial test tour to India in September 2013. In October 2018, Cricket West Indies (CWI) awarded him a red-ball contract for the 2018‚Äì19 season. International career Bishoo was a replacement for the injured Dwayne Bravo at the World Cup in Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka from 19 February to 2 April 2011. He made his international debut against England at Chennai on 17 March, taking 3/34 in his 10 overs. Bishoo adapted his bowling to the slow pitches of the Indian subcontinent, reducing the pace of his stock delivery and introducing variations of speed. Bishoo played his first Twenty20 International match against Pakistan at St.Lucia. He put in a match-winning performance of 4/17 in 4 overs taking the Man of the Match award as West Indies won by 7 runs. When Australia visited in March 2012, the selectors rested Bishoo for the ODI series. It was hoped that he would be more effective in the Tests if the Australian batsmen were not allowed to get used to his bowling. In the event he played just one Test, conceding 169 runs for a solitary wicket, and was replaced by off-spinner Shane Shillingford. Rather than accompanying the West Indies on their tour of England in May 2012, it was felt that Bishoo would be better off accompanying West Indies A in India to regain confidence. On 16 October 2016, Bishoo took 8 wickets in a match against Pakistan. This was the second best figures by any West Indian spinner and the best by a leg-spinner. He took 10 wickets for 174 in that match, and it was his first 10 wicket haul in tests. This is also the best bowling performance by any visiting bowler in Asian sub-continent. Devendra Bishoo also set the record for becoming the first ever bowler to take 10 wicket haul in a day night test match and was also the only spinner as well as a legspinner to achieve this milestone. He was also the first bowler to take a 7 wicket haul as well as an 8 wicket haul in an innings of a day/night test match. He was also the only spinner to take a 6 wicket haul in an innings of a day/night test match.

He is known for his portraits, history paintings and his many drawings.Hans Speckaert at the Netherlands Institute for Art History The artist was one of the earliest representatives of Northern Mannerism. His fluid and elegant drawing style exerted an important influence on contemporary Northern artists.Hans Speckaert, The Crucifixion of Christ at The Metropolitan Museum of Art Life Details about the life of the artist are scarce. According to the early Flemish painter and artist biographer Karel van Mander Speckaert was the son of an embroiderer in Brussels and a friend of the painter Aert Mijtens.Hans Speeckaert in: Karel van Mander', Het Schilder-boeck, 1604 He may have received his training in the Brussels workshop of Pieter de Kempeneer who was known as Pedro Campa√±a (1503-1580).Hans Speckaert, at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen Portrait of Cornelis Cort He travelled to Italy at an unknown date and is believed to have arrived in Rome sometime in 1566. Van Mander visited Italy during the period that Speckaert was there. In Rome, Speckaert joined a group of Northern painters working in Rome in the 16th century. He made a close study of the art of the great Italian Renaissance masters Michelangelo, Raphael, and others. A document from April 1575 reports that the artist had been paralyzed. Possibly this was the result of an accident which had occurred while he was working at an unknown church early in the year 1575, together with the artist Anthonie van Santvoort. After a long period in Rome, Speckaert attempted to return to the Netherlands and got as far as Florence, but feeling unwell, he turned back to Rome, where he died. His death likely occurred around 1577. Work Hans Speckaert is known for his portraits, history paintings and his many drawings. Only four paintings have been attributed with certainty to the artist, including the portrait of the engraver Cornelis Cort (Kunsthistorisches Museum), who was a close friend. The other known paintings include Moses and the Brazen Serpent (Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Buenos Aires), Diana and Actaeon (Palazzo Patrizi, Rome) and The Conversion of St Paul (Louvre, Paris).Ter√©z Gerszi. \\"Speeckaert, Jan.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 21 November 2016 He made designs for prints that were executed by Cornelis Cort en Aegidius Sadeler and form the basis for further attributions. His oeuvre is not yet clearly defined since the attribution of drawings is hampered by the fact that the artist's work was widely imitated. The Conversion of St Paul His close study of the art of the Italian Renaissance masters informs the muscular, monumental figures in his work. In his Ja√´l and Sisera (Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen) the short perspective of the deceased Sisera shows the Mannerist preoccupation with the depiction of the human body. The emphatic, somewhat theatrical, postures of Jael and her companion Barak are characteristic of his Mannerism.Boymans verwerft schilderij Hans Speckaert in the nrc newspaper The work of Jacopo Bertoja, which was close to that of Parmigianino, was influential on his style.Jos Koldeweij, Alexandra Hermesdorf, Paul Huvenne, De schilderkunst der Lage Landen: De Middeleeuwen en de zestiende eeuw, Amsterdam University Press, 2006, p. 284 Speckaert's fluid and elegant drawing style exerted an important influence on his Northern contemporaries, as is witnessed, in particular, in the drawings of Bartholomeus Spranger, Jan Soens, Hans von Aachen, Joseph Heintz the Elder and Karel van Mander. This was made possible because Speckaert's friend Anthonie van Santvoort, who managed his estate after his death and inherited his drawings via Cornelis Cort, who died a year after Speckaert, opened his house to artists who visited Rome so that they could study Speckaert's drawings. Speckaert's designs were used as models for prints by Aegidius Sadeler, Cornelis Cort, Pedro Perret and Jan Harmensz. Muller.

Description Aussiedraco is known from holotype QM F10613, a partial mandibular symphysis housed at the Queensland Museum, recovered from rocks of the Toolebuc Formation, about 70 km east of Boulia, western Queensland, dating to Albian stage. It was named by Alexander W.A. Kellner, Taissa Rodrigues and Fabiana R. Costa in 2011 and the type species is Aussiedraco molnari. The generic name is derived from \\"Aussie\\", a shortened form of Australian, and \\"draco\\", from Latin meaning dragon. The specific epithet honours Ralph E. Molnar, who first described the specimen in 1980. The symphysis fragment is 88 millimetres long and very straight and narrow, with a lanceolate not-expanded tip and triangular cross-section. It lacks a keel or crest and is convex on top, with a median narrow deep groove not reaching the tip, but flat at the bottom. As far as can be judged from the empty elliptical tooth-sockets, the lower jaws carry at least five pairs of teeth, which are rather large and become more outwards inclining and procumbent towards the front. Aussiedraco is estimated to have been smaller in size than Mythunga, a pterosaur from the same formation. Classification Kellner et al. assigned Aussiedraco to the Pteranodontoidea, a clade roughly containing the same species as the Ornithocheiroidea sensu Unwin. Aussiedraco would be closely related to the Anhangueridae. P√™gas et al. (2019) recovered Aussiedraco as a member of the ornithocheiromorph clade Targaryendraconia.Rodrigo V.

He was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium-fast. McIntosh was educated at Uppingham School in Rutland, where he played for the school cricket team and for three years he was the mainstay of their bowling attack, captaining the side in 1926, a season in which he took 45 wickets at a bowling average of 11.45. He later went to University College, Oxford, where he played for the University Cricket Club, making his first-class debut in 1927 against the Harlequins. 1927 was also the year that McIntosh played his only first-class match for the West of England when they played the touring New Zealanders at the County Ground, Exeter; additionally in 1927 he also made three appearances for Devon in the Minor Counties Championship. From 1927 to 1929, McIntosh made 21 first-class appearances for Oxford University, playing his final match for them against Surrey. McIntosh received his Oxford Blue in his first year of 1927, thanks largely to an injury to Walter McBride, and in 1928. Poor health and having to bowl on over-prepared wickets which led to a poor bowling season for him in 1929 ruled him out of contention for a Blue in that year. A bowler, he took 62 wickets in total for the University. These came at an average of 34.33 and included two five wicket hauls, with best figures of 5/52. McIntosh later returned to the British Raj, where he played a single first-class match each for the Europeans (India) against the Indians and for Madras against the Marylebone Cricket Club, both in 1934.

The TMO was set up on 1 April 1996, under the UK Government's Housing (Right to Manage) Regulations 1994. Kensington and Chelsea TMO was the largest TMO in the UK and unique in having been the only TMO that managed the entire housing stock for the local council. Following the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, the council terminated its contract with KCTMO. Since January 2018, the housing has been directly managed by the council. However, KCTMO continues to exist as a legal entity so that it can be represented at the Grenfell Tower Inquiry.  History  The Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation was established on 1 April 1996, when it assumed management of 9,760 properties from the council. Run by a board of 13 tenants, it was described at the time as \\"one of Britain's most ambitious property management schemes\\". In December 2017 the TMO board reluctantly decided that it could no longer guarantee that it could deliver services to a standard that residents should expect and fulfil all its duties contained in its contract with the council (known as the modular management agreement or MMA). The board decided that it would be in the best interests of all residents that the services which the TMO provided were temporarily handed back to the council while it carries out consultation about the future management of its housing stock. The handback took place on 1 March 2018. The handback consisted of all the services to residents and those support functions required to enable these services to be provided. The TMO continues to exist as an independent corporate entity and the board will continue to be accountable to its members. The resident-led board has an ongoing role in scrutinising the delivery of services under the MMA, as well as ensuring ongoing assistance to the public inquiry and criminal investigation. The Council has confirmed that it will continue to fund the TMO to ensure it can continue to do so, and that answers to the Grenfell Tower Inquiry are obtained.  Oversight and membership  The TMO has a board comprising eight residents, four council-appointed members and three independent members. Labour councillor and now MP, Emma Dent Coad was a council-appointed board member from 2008 to 31 October 2012. Membership is open to any named tenant or leaseholder of a property owned by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea who is over the age of eighteen.  Recognition  Kensington and Chelsea TMO has previously received a three-star status from the Audit Commission for its services. In 2008 Juliet Rawlings, chair of the TMO's Board from 2003, was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours for her work with the organisation. In 2016 the chair, Fay Edwards, was awarded the British Empire Medal for her services to the community in Kensington and Chelsea.  Grenfell Tower fire  On 14 June 2017 a large fire engulfed Grenfell Tower, a 24-floor, 120-flat block managed by KCTMO. Grenfell Action Group, the block's tenant organisation, had repeatedly warned of major fire safety lapses since 2013. A blog entry posted on 20 November 2016 described KCTMO as \\"an evil, unprincipled, mini-mafia\\" and predicted that only a \\"catastrophic event\\" leading to \\"serious loss of life\\" such as \\"a serious fire in a tower block\\" would result in change. At a meeting in January 2016, the residents association presented the findings of a survey which found that 68% of residents had felt harassed or intimidated by the KCTMO or its contractors, and that 90% were dissatisfied with the manner in which improvement works had been carried out. In the aftermath of the disaster, KCTMO has been further criticised for appealing to the public for donations to support the victims, despite giving no indication that it is donating to them itself. In August 2017, it was announced that KCTMO would no longer manage the Lancaster West Estate containing Grenfell Tower, which would come under direct council control. In September 2017 Kensington and Chelsea councillors voted unanimously to end the contract with KCTMO, stating that the firm \\"no longer has the trust of residents in the borough\\". In late December 2017 KCTMO announced that it would be handing control of all of its housing stock back to the council by 31 January 2018 as an \\"interim measure\\".

Bridges cross the lake at regular intervals to link the inhabited zone with the park.  Transport  The neighbourhood is intended to have as little traffic as possible, most of the roads are therefore planned as pedestrian zones. In addition to the Glattalbahn, which runs the length and breadth of the southern and western side of the neighbourhood, several bus lines linking it to public transport are under discussion. It is planned to have bus line 781 run through the neighbourhood on Boulevard Lilienthal as soon as this road has been completed. The nearby railway station Opfikon provides access to the Z√ºrich S-Bahn network, the Glattalbahn forms a direct link to the train stations of Z√ºrich Oerlikon, Glattbrugg and Stettbach. On the western side, the four-lane Thurgauerstrasse leads to the intersection of Opfikon with the Highway A51 (airport motorway).

Many wealthy Chinese send their children abroad for their education. This is especially true in the United States, Europe, and parts of Canada, where it is common to see well-off Chinese students attending universities driving expensive cars and wearing brand name clothing and gadgets which have price tags that are out of reach for the vast majority of North American and European students.

Tzigara, Tzigara-Sumurca»ô, Tzigara-Samurcash, Tzigara-Samurkasch or »öigara-Samurca»ô; April 4, 1872 ‚Äì April 1, 1952) was a Romanian art historian, ethnographer, museologist and cultural journalist, also known as local champion of art conservation, Romanian Police leader and pioneer radio broadcaster. Tzigara was a member of the Junimea literary society, holding positions at the National School of Fine Arts, the University of Bucharest and lastly the University of CernƒÉu»õi. During his youth, he was secretary to Carol I, the King of Romania. Close to the royal family, he also served as head of the Carol I Academic Foundation, where he set up a large collection of photographic plates. Tzigara achieved fame in 1906 as founder of the \\"National Museum\\", nucleus of the present-day Museum of the Romanian Peasant, but was also involved in arranging and preserving the Theodor Aman art fund. During World War I, Tzigara-Samurca»ô irritated Romanian public opinion by accepting to serve in a puppet administration set up by the Central Powers. Although his conduct was considered benign by the legitimate government, it drew him accusations of collaborationism from within academia, and aggravated his long-standing conflict with historian Nicolae Iorga. Tzigara was prevented from advancing in his university career over the interwar period, but compensated for this mishap with other achievements: he was a delegate to several world fairs, the first-ever lecturer on Radio Romania's staff, the editor in chief of Convorbiri Literare magazine, and, shortly before retirement, a corresponding member of the Academy. His post-World War II years were spent in obscurity, owing to his ideological incompatibility with the Romanian communist regime. Alexandru Tzigara-Samurca»ô was alleged to be Carol I's illegitimate son, a rumor fueled by his closeness to court. He was himself the father of artist Ana Tzigara Berza, and father in law of folklorist Marcu Berza.

Alexandru Barnea, \\"Moartea lui Carol I\\", in Ziarul Financiar, October 20, 2006 A popular rumor has him as the illegitimate son of Domnitor Carol I, the future King of Romania, to whom Tzigara was especially close in later years. Z. Ornea, \\"MƒÉrturisirile lui Tzigara- Samurca»ô\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 3/2000 Vasile Docea, \\"La curtea iubirilor reprimate\\" , in Tribuna, Nr. 41/2004, p.12Boia, p.327; NastasƒÉ (2010), p.89 Historian Lucian Boia gives some credit to this piece of oral history, and notes that Tzigara, like Wilhelm and Mite Kremnitz, had \\"an unusually tight relationship\\" with the royal family.Boia, p.327 Researcher Zigu Ornea, who notes that Tzigara may have been spreading the story around, argues: \\"This legend is naturally hard to verify but, in any case, it is a possible one, since Tzigara-Samurca»ô was born in 1872 and Carol I was present on our throne, as Domnitor, from 1866.\\" Like Boia, Ornea notes that Tzigara's close relationship with the king, the king's repeated interventions on his behalf \\"every time [Tzigara's career] got stuck\\", and his contacts with the Kremnitzes (including Mite, Carol's alleged mistress) were some additional clues to a royal bloodline. Historian Vasile Docea criticizes Ornea's verdict, noting that it relies on questionable sources, and argues that, far from embracing this legend, Tzigara spoke \\"with evident pride\\" about his Tzigara roots. According to historian Lucian NastasƒÉ, Docea effectively \\"disproved\\" the rumor of Alexandru Tzigara-Samurca»ôs royal descent.NastasƒÉ (2010), p.89 Alexandru's mother and Carol's alleged mistress was Elena Samurca»ô, married to Toma Tzigara. Research into his maternal genealogy led the art historian to conclude that he was of noble Greek and Italo-Greek descent: his supposed ancestor was Spatharios Zotos Tzigaras, buried in Venice at San Giorgio dei Greci (1599).RƒÉdulescu (2000), p.343-344 The Samurca»ô family had aristocratic blood, being related to the boyar nobility of Wallachia: the art historian's paternal line made him a relative of the Kretzulescu, Rallet, Bengescu and Cre»õeanu boyar families.NastasƒÉ (2007), p.162; (2010), p.89, 331 Combined arms of the Tzigara and Samurca»ô families Also of boyar rank, Alexandru's Samurca»ô ancestors had a history on both sides of the Southern Carpathians, in Wallachia and in then-Austrian-ruled Transylvania. Active during the Age of Revolution, Wallachian Vornic Constantin Samurca»ô took part in Eterist agitation,RƒÉdulescu (2000), p.350 but later, fleeing the 1821 rural uprising, settled in Kronstadt (Bra»ôov) to spy for the Austrians. Dumitru H√Æncu, \\"Al. Tzigara-Samurca»ô - Din amintirile primului vorbitor la Radio rom√¢nesc\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 42/2007 Another ancestor, Postelnic Alecu Samurca»ô, was a linguist, known for his work in the Greek language.NastasƒÉ (2010), p.90 The meeting of two branches was recorded in the coat of arms that Tzigara-Samurca»ô fashioned for himself, showing the spatha of Zotos Tzigaras, alongside a sable (Romanian: samur) and a stylized eyebrow. A while after Toma Tzigara's death, Alexandru was adopted by his childless uncle Ioan Alecu Samurca»ô (he officially took the name Tzigara-Samurca»ô years later, in 1899); he was also helped with his education by the Kremnitzes, who taught him German, introduced him to high society circles, and regarded him as a son.NastasƒÉ (2010), p.89-90, 347 His first contacts with history and folk art came by means of his extended family, which collected and preserved documents and art objects.RƒÉdulescu (2000), p.344 After graduating from the Matei Basarab High School and taking his Baccalaureate, he enlisted at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters, Historical Section. It was here that the young man was acquainted with his first mentors: writer-collector Alexandru Odobescu and archeologist Grigore Tocilescu, the latter of whom ensured Tzigara's employment as custodian for the National Museum of Antiquities. He was a critic of the museum's underdevelopment under Tocilescu's management, and wrote that the disorganized collection comprised an Egyptian mummy, copies of frescoes from the Cathedral Church in Curtea de Arge»ô, items from the Pietroasele Treasure, and works of Precolumbian art, alongside a scale model of the Eiffel Tower.

See also LuceafƒÉrul (1914), p.265 the young graduate was in the German Empire, where he studied at the University of Berlin and the Ludwig Maximilian University, taking his Ph.D. in Munich with a dissertation on the Baroque painter Simon Vouet. He received his diploma, magna cum laude.LuceafƒÉrul (1914), p.265 Tzigara-Samurca»ô returned to his home country and, following a dispute with Tocilescu, gave up his position at the Antiquities Museum. He later specialized in museology in Paris, hearing lectures at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and working for city museums, before returning to Germany, where he studied with the preeminent Brunswickian curator Wilhelm von Bode. =Early academic career= Palace of the Carol I Academic Foundation, ca. 1904 (photograph by Alexandru Antoniu) Back in Romania, Tzigara unsuccessfully applied for the Archeology Chair created at the University of Ia»ôi, but lost; according to scholar and diarist Teohari Antonescu, who emerged as the victor, the competition was rigged in his own favor, even though Tzigara \\"had the good sense to come prepared.\\"NastasƒÉ (2007), p.372 From 1899, he was librarian of the Carol I Academic Foundation and Professor of Aesthetics and Art History at the National School of Fine Arts.LuceafƒÉrul (1914), p.265-266; Boia, p.327 As Tzigara later acknowledged, his introduction to royalty came through a relationship with the Kremnitzes, his neighbors on PolonƒÉ Street, Doroban»õi. This period saw the start of Tzigara's close relationship with Carol, whom the art historian later called \\"my most generous protector\\" and \\"the sovereign par excellence\\". Received into royal circles, he was a confidant of the Queen Consort and cultural patron, Elisabeth of Wied, whom he called \\"the animator of Romanian art\\".CiupalƒÉ, p.98 For a while, he was her private secretary, helping her fulfill her literary ambitions under the Carmen Sylva signature.NastasƒÉ (2007), p.162-163 Tzigara's recollections speak with enthusiasm about Elisabeth's works, as well as about the king's dislike for her interests in spiritism or philosophy, and discuss Carol's enduring affection for Mite Kremnitz. In order to support his lectures at the Fine Arts School, Tzigara began gathering photographic plates, a collection which grew in size over the following decades. It includes images of European monuments and works of art, as well as samples of Romanian architecture (in some cases, the only surviving images of since-demolished buildings) and copies of maps. The images of local life are considered of particular importance, since they document the Westernization and modernization of Romania's landscape. Mostly anonymous works, they most likely include some of Tzigara's own photographs. A few of them were inventoried by Editura Casa »òcoalelor, and some were published, in Tzigara's lifetime, by Buletinul Comisiunii Monumentelor Istorice or other Romanian scientific magazines. His image projections at the Carol I Foundation, supporting a students' elective course on sculpture and painting, became one of the better- known student summer activities. Andrei Pippidi, \\"Amintirile unui arhitect\\", in Dilema Veche, Nr. 216, April 2008 The young scholar was at the time also interested in the development of decorative arts, which he wanted to reflect the local tradition of handicrafts and notions of national specificity.Vlasiu, p.51-52 According to art historian Ioana Vlasiu, Tzigara and painter- researcher Abgar Baltazar were in part responsible for fusing local folk art and international primitivism with Art Nouveau, thus paving the way for the Neo-Br√¢ncovenesc school of decorators and architects.Vlasiu, passim The interest in decorative works was a special focus of his visits to England and France‚Äîthe South Kensington Museum impressed him greatly, as did the workshops of Eug√®ne Grasset and Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran. =Junimea debut= Described by Lucian NastasƒÉ as a case of social climbing, Tzigara's marriage to Maria (1900) brought him into the high circles of aristocracy: Maria, born into the Cantacuzino family (daughter of Alexandru Cantacuzino, former Foreign Affairs Minister), was also the widow of Grigore Sturdza, and as such inherited part of the Sturdza family fortune.NastasƒÉ (2003), p.53-54, 109; (2007), p.162-163; (2010), p.90, 168, 347 Through her mother Coralia, Maria Tzigara-Cantacuzino was additionally related to boyar lines of Moldavia, the Boldurs and the Costakis, as well as to Zulnia, mother of historian Nicolae Iorga.NastasƒÉ (2003), p.54, 71; (2010), p.90, 168, 331 This marriage was reportedly arranged by the Kremnitzes, the couple having as their best men- godfathers two influential political figures: Lupu Kostaki, Constantin C. Arion.NastasƒÉ (2010), p.90, 111, 346-347 During the fin de si√®cle period, Tzigara-Samurca»ô»ô also began a cooperation with Junimea, the literary society representing Romanian traditional conservatism, and sympathized with the Junimist nucleus of the Conservative Party. The art historian was one of the young scholars fascinated with the personality of Titu Maiorescu, the cultural critic and main Junimea leader, and joined a new Junimist critical elite which also comprised Constantin RƒÉdulescu-Motru, Pompiliu Eliade, Mihail Dragomirescu, P. P. Negulescu etc.NastasƒÉ (2003), p.151-152; (2007), p.173-174 His work was featured, along with texts by other 50 Junimists, in the Editura Socec volume Lui Titu Maiorescu omagiu, XV februarie MCM (\\"To Titu Maiorescu as Homage, February 15, 1900\\").NastasƒÉ (2003), p.151-152 Maiorescu's diaries display his interest in Tzigara's private life, and claim that the scholar was by then lover of the widowed and much older Mite Kremnitz, with whom Maiorescu himself had had an affair. Tzigara attended, in 1901, a major event in Junimist society: the wedding between Nicolae Iorga and Ecaterina, daughter of scholar Ioan Bogdan, where Tzigara unofficially represented the royal court.NastasƒÉ (2003), p.39, 71 Tzigara was the couple's godfather at an Orthodox marriage service held outside the Kingdom of Romania, in Belgerei (»òcheii Bra»ôovului), Transylvania.NastasƒÉ (2003), p.71; (2007), p.323; (2010), p.168 For a while, Iorga and Bogdan were both interested in obtaining Tzigara a better employment at the University of Bucharest, but their efforts were made useless by the Junimea adversary in government, the National Liberal Party.NastasƒÉ (2007), p.321-323 Before 1903, Tzigara became a literary and art columnist at Epoca newspaper, headed at the time by Maiorescu.Ornea (1998), p.122 During the period, Junimea popularized its causes through Epoca, rather than through their main venue Convorbiri Literare, and, according to Maiorescu's own pronouncement, Tzigara's work was a main asset. Around 1907, Tzigara's work was also regularly featured in Convorbiri Literare, edited by Maiorescu's pupil Simion Mehedin»õi. At the time, Transylvania's RƒÉva»ôul journal commented that Tzigara's art chronicle and Aurel Popovici's political column were especially \\"rich\\" in information, and mentioned that Tzigara and Teohari Antonescu were debating, through the journal, about the characteristics of fortified houses (cule) from Oltenia region. \\"CƒÉr»õi, reviste, ziare\\", in RƒÉva»ôul, Nr. 21-22/1907, p.382 (digitized by the Babe»ô- Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) As literary historian Tudor Vianu notes, Tzigara-Samurca»ô and architect Aurel Zagoritz centered their contributions here on the scientific study of Romanian folk art, but their presence nevertheless coincided with Convorbiri Literares decline in readership.Tudor Vianu, Scriitori rom√¢ni, Vol. II, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1970, p.11. Tzigara also published his articles in Iorga's traditionalist magazine SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul, where he discussed the art exhibits of the Tinerimea ArtisticƒÉ society.»òotropa, p.28 =National Museum creation= A village mill, preserved in the Museum of the Romanian Peasant Around 1901, inspired by the Paris World Fair, Tzigara and other Romanian ethnographers first took into consideration the establishment of a permanent ethnographic collection.Longuet, p.144; Vlasiu, p.51 Like other Romanian intellectuals, Tzigara preserved his special interest in handicrafts, which, art conservator Isabelle Longuet argues, were \\"elevated to the status of 'national art' \\" in the belief that the peasantry represented \\"an authentic 'Romanianness' \\".Longuet, p.144 In similar terms, ethologist Ioana Popescu notes: \\"[Tzigara's] collections were to become the argument and the source of inspiration for the national ideology and creation.\\"Ioana Popescu, \\"A Fragile Collection - The Memory of Glass Plates\\", in the Romanian Cultural Institute's Plural Magazine , Nr. 21/2004 His project came after a similar attempt on the part of art collector Nicolae Minovici, founder of the private folk art museum Casa Minovici, Adina Dini»õoiu, \\" 'Vila cu clopo»õei are noi prieteni' \\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 319, May 2006 and an even earlier textile art archive, endorsed by Maiorescu (1875).Narcis Dorin Ion, \\"Urban Memory: Museums of the Romanian Capital\\", in the Romanian Cultural Institute's Plural Magazine , Nr. 32/2008 1906 marked the start of Tzigara's chief work as an ethnographer. That year, he founded the \\"Museum of Ethnography and National Art\\", now Museum of the Romanian Peasant (and which he intended to name \\"Museum of the Romanian People\\"),TƒÉslƒÉuanu, p.60. On the other proposed names, see Vlasiu, p.51 serving as its Director for the next forty years. This project received support from Education Minister Haret and, on the other side of politics, from Haret's predecessor Maiorescu. The institution was later known as \\"Museum of Ethnography and National Art\\" or \\"Carol I Museum of Ethnography and National Art\\". Alexandru Barnea, \\"Meteorologie »ôi etnografie √Æn Bucure»ôti, acum 99 de ani\\", in Ziarul Financiar, October 6, 2006 Its original quarters were the abandoned National Mint building on Kiseleff Road, but plans were being made for a new, more adequate museum palace. As manager, Tzigara-Samurca»ô ordered the collection into two distinct sections, dedicated respectively to ethnography-proper and sacred art (the latter chapter also took over the religious objects kept at the National Museum of Antiquities). An additional exhibit was to include the Tropaeum Traiani metopes, attesting the Roman Empire's rule over Dobruja. Tzigara's subsequent work as a collector and folk art historian received much appreciation. A 1914 article in LuceafƒÉrul journal stated: \\"[He] reorganized [the museum] and turned into a true national institution. The Museum's rich collections are owed to Mr. Tzigara-Samurca»ô's industriousness.\\"LuceafƒÉrul (1914), p.266 In 2010, folk art reviewer Mihai PlƒÉmƒÉdealƒÉ wrote that Tzigara's activity \\"impacted on everything that this Museum ever meant in the history of Romanian culture.\\" Tzigara's fieldwork also focused specifically on increasing the museum's ethnographic collection. Particularly active in Oltenia, he was, as Ioana Popescu notes, \\"more attracted by decorated, colorful objects, used at celebration time.\\" During one such trip to Gorj County, he bought, disassembled and transported back to Bucharest the \\"Antonie Mogo»ô House\\", considered a masterpiece of Romanian woodcarving and the museum's centerpiece. Miron Manega, \\"Etnografia rom√¢neascƒÉ √Æn epoca de pia»õƒÉ\\" , in SƒÉptƒÉm√¢na FinanciarƒÉ, April 28, 2006 It is the first-ever such relocation in the history of Romanian museums.Georgeta Stoica, \\"A Landmark on the European Map: the Dimitrie Gusti National Village Museum\\", in the Romanian Cultural Institute's Plural Magazine , Nr. 24/2004 His photographic collection was expanded by an entire series on Oltenian carpets, which helps in their specific taxonomy. The developments raised interest among the ethnic Romanian community of Transylvania, whose cultural body, the ASTRA Society, was in the process of creating its own permanent exhibit of folk architecture, later ASTRA National Museum Complex. ASTRA activist Octavian TƒÉslƒÉuanu reported in 1909: \\"[Tzigara's] national art museum, although [...] important sums were spent on it, is at the early stage of its beginnings. Only two years ago did more systematic work begin for its endowment and presently, its national significance recognized, the state granted it a yearly sum of 14,000 lei [...]. And maybe in a few years those who are running it, so diligently, will manage to turn it into an institution of great importance for our national art.\\"TƒÉslƒÉuanu, p.60-61 The next year, Tzigara himself wrote, in Convorbiri Literare, that TƒÉslƒÉuanu's work with ASTRA permanent exhibits was far more advanced than his when it came to storage and display, but noted that the ASTRA collections were not yet rich enough to validate the \\"museum\\" name. \\"√énsemnƒÉri. Muzeul Asocia»õiunii\\", in Transilvania, Nr. 5/1910, p.376 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) =Aman Museum and Bucharest University= Theodor Aman, √én atelierul artistului (\\"In the Artist's Studio\\") During those years, Tzigara was also an inspector and evaluator of works collected from Secu Monastery and the Diocese of BuzƒÉu, becoming both a Fellow of the Romanian Royal Society of Geography and the Architects' Society. Tzigara also served as representative of the Romanian curators in European colloquiums: the Public Art Congress of Li√®ge, Belgium (1905) and the Braunschweig Congress on Art Conservation (1906), where he presented a report on the efforts to preserve Romanian monuments. Also in 1906, Tzigara-Samurca»ô attended the 8th International Congress of Art History. Once familiarized with the artistic fashions of the day, Tzigara reported to the National Liberal Education Minister Spiru Haret about the need to reform the educational system in such manner as to provide peasant children with an artistic education, citing reasons moral and economical.Vlasiu, p.51 Around 1908, Tzigara was also involved in the process of cataloging and preserving the body of works left by Romanian painter Theodor Aman. The Aman Museum appointed him director, and, under his leadership, opened its doors to the public for the very first time. Tzigara was also involved in controversies marking the celebration of Carol I's 40th year on the throne, when he spoke out against politician Ioan Lahovary, accused of mismanaging the Carol Park festivities.NastasƒÉ (2007), p.37 The creation of a separate University of Bucharest Art History Department for Tzigara was a project which split the academic and political world. At the core of such disputes was Nicolae Iorga, from the History Department, who argued that his own courses also covered art, and who consequently became Tzigara's main adversary.NastasƒÉ (2007), p.36-37, 323 The proposal of expanding University was also defeated in Parliament by Lahovary, the Senate president, who probably still resented for his 1906 comments. The debates prolonged themselves over the following years. In 1909, Tzigara-Samurca»ô, Grigore Tocilescu and George Murnu competed with each other for the Archeology Chair, and this created a dispute over whether art historians could not lecture in archeology (Murnu eventually won the contest, despite being exposed for plagiarism by Tzigara, in articles for the magazine Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ).NastasƒÉ (2007), p.37, 310-311 The same year, he was in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, where he visited the Skansen, Bygd√∏y and Lyngby open-air museums, but suggested that a similar project would be redundant at home, arguing that peasant society in Romania was only too visible around Bucharest. Mihai Sorin RƒÉdulescu, \\"Skansen »ôi muzeele etnografice din Bucure»ôti\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 36/2009 He was much more impressed with the Nordic Museum, which reportedly became the template for his Bucharest museum. In 1911 (or 1912), Tzigara eventually became a Substitute Professor of Art History at the University of Bucharest,Boia, p.108, 327, 353; NastasƒÉ (2007), p.36 attending the Great Art Exhibit of Berlin and, in Italy, the Esposizione internazionale d'arte. He lectured on folk art at the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin and in Austria-Hungary, at the Vienna Museum f√ºr angewandte Kunst. Overall, his mission was to introduce Romanian art to an international audience, as noted by LuceafƒÉrul: \\"he arranged the Romanian pavilions, making known for the first time in history the artistic creations of our people. In all exhibits he registered successes\\". A prestigious visitor of the National Museum was Raymund Netzhammer, the Catholic Archbishop of Bucharest, who was introduced there by Tzigara, with whom he remained good friends. Netzhammer was impressed with its ethnographic collection: \\"Nowhere can one acquire a better eye for Romanian folk art than in this establishment.\\" In support of his activities, Tzigara published a succession of art books. In 1906, Arta publicƒÉ (\\"Public Art\\") appeared in Bucharest, while the German-language study Denkmalpflege in Rum√§nien (\\"Historical Preservation in Romania\\") saw print in Karlsruhe. Later, Tzigara contributed biographical and critical entries in the 1907 edition of Allgemeines Lexicon der bildenden K√ºnstler. Catalogul Muzeului Aman (\\"The Aman Museum Catalog\\") of 1908 was followed the same year by the essay Ce se √Æn»õelege prin arheologia de azi (\\"The Present-day Meaning of Archeology\\") and the monograph Biserica din Filipe»ôtii de PƒÉdure (\\"The Church of Filipe»ôtii de PƒÉdure\\", co-authored with Nicolae Ghica-Bude»ôti and Gheorghe Bal»ô).LuceafƒÉrul (1914), p.266, 268 In 1909, he authored the album-study Arta √Æn Rom√¢nia (\\"Art in Romania\\"), comprising his collected Convorbiri essays and edited by Minerva, Gheorghe Oprescu, \\"Arta »õƒÉrƒÉneascƒÉ la Rom√¢ni\\", in Transilvania, Nr. 11/1920, p.860 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) together with another monograph, Muzeul neamului rom√¢nesc (\\"The Museum of the Romanian People\\"). The next year, he followed up with Discu»õiuni √Æn jurul arheologiei (\\"Debates on Archeology\\") and Rum√§nische Volkskunst (\\"Romanian Folk Art\\"); in 1911, with Casa rom√¢neascƒÉ de la Roma (\\"The Romanian House of Rome\\"); in 1912, with Sonderaustellung Rum√§niens (\\"Romania's Special Exhibit\\"), Istoria artei »ôi √ÆnsemnƒÉtatea ei (Art History and Its Significance\\"), Muzeul na»õional din Bucure»ôti (\\"The National Museum Bucharest\\"). Between 1909 and 1912, he also redacted Carol I's 17 volumes of memoirs, working from scattered notebooks. As an art critic for Epoca and Convorbiri, Tzigara became one of those who opposed the new primitivist tendencies of the Tinerimea ArtisticƒÉ group: in 1910, he chided the modern sculptor Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi for his break with tradition, and even suggested that Br√¢ncu»ôi's works be hidden away from the public eye.Juvara, p.78, 81 Such reactions made Br√¢ncu»ôi decide to leave Romania and begin his international career.Juvara, p.78-79 While in Rome, Tzigara was reputedly offered membership in the Freemasonry's Grand Orient de France, to whom many of Romanian colleagues belonged (see Freemasonry in Romania). The offer, Tzigara later claimed, was made by sculptor Ettore Ferrari, and included various perks and a promise that he would soon become a Masonic Grand Master.NastasƒÉ (2007), p.102-103; (2010), p.230 Although widely rumored to have taken up the offer, NastasƒÉ writes, Tzigara was probably never a Freemason. Also in 1911, he was briefly President of a newly created professional association, the Romanian Writers' Society.NastasƒÉ (2007), p.525 =1910s projects and ASTRA conferencing= Sibiu Cathedral, with paintings by Octavian Smigelschi Tzigara's honors for 1912 included the Romanian Kingdom's Bene Merenti medal for services to culture.NastasƒÉ (2007), p.134 During much of that year, after some campaigning to obtain state funds, the art historian considered proposals for the Ethnography Museum's headquarters, also housed on Kiseleff. He and his colleagues looked into international proposals, from Heino Schmieden, Louis Blanc and others, but eventually settled for a design proposed to them by the Romanian native Ghica-Bude»ôti. The Neo-Br√¢ncovenesc features of the building, researchers note, where themselves an attempt to highlight the return to a peasant model.Longuet, p.144, 146 This formed part of a greater urban planning effort undertaken, with Carol I's approval and the involvement of Neo- Br√¢ncovenesc architects, throughout northern and central Bucharest, with the erecting of many new public buildings: the Palace of Justice, the CEC Palace, the Geology Museum etc. (see History of Bucharest). Andrei Pippidi, \\"Tot despe Carol I\\", in Dilema Veche, Nr. 227, June 2008 Despite the approval, and the ceremonial placement of a foundation stone, construction was remarkably slow or under-financed, and Tzigara, who came to resent Ghica-Bude»ôti, did not live to see its completion. Tzigara's scientific work for 1913, when he also attended the Tentoonstelling De Vrouw event in Amsterdam, includes a monograph on the Curtea de Arge»ô Cathedral Church. That year, as Romania joined the Second Balkan War coalition against the Kingdom of Bulgaria, and although spared from conscription, Tzigara volunteered for service in the Romanian Land Forces.NastasƒÉ (2007), p.91 He motivated this initiative by stating that his skill was needed for documenting the war and creating its archive. Tzigara served in the 4th Army Corps, under Crown Prince Ferdinand (Carol I's designated successor). In 1914, Tzigara was appointed Director of the Carol I Foundation. At around the same time, he began a new series of conferences in Austria-Hungary, lecturing on art for the benefit of Romanians in Transylvania and Banat regions. He was also interested in the collection of Transylvanian Romanian artifacts, added to the Bucharest Museum collection. Initially, he was in Lugosch (Lugoj), informing locals about Romanian folk art. One other such event took place in Hermannstadt (Sibiu), where he was invited by ASTRA to speak about the 50 years of development in Romanian art.LuceafƒÉrul (1914), passim This conference contained Tzigara' artistic credo: he believed that art was an objective reflection of social and cultural development, identifying the Westernization process, the proclamation of the 1881 Kingdom and later events with a profound transformation of Romania.LuceafƒÉrul (1914), p.266-267 However, Tzigara suggested, these efforts did not yet find a suitable answer in the artistic field, that is the birth of a specifically Romanian art phenomenon and the proper conservation of artistic legacies: he deplored the destruction of old Bucharest townhouses and their replacement with Westernized villas; he commended the restoration of Horezu Monastery in its original Br√¢ncovenesc style, but criticized those who introduced Gothic revival elements at Tismana, Bistri»õa or Arnota; lastly, he expressed support for the \\"healthy\\" Neo-Br√¢ncovenesc style of Ion Mincu and criticized muralist Octavian Smigelschi for his work on the Sibiu Cathedral.LuceafƒÉrul (1914), p.267-268 The conference included ample praise of Carol I as a patron of conservation, and nods in the direction of Carol's French architect, Andr√© Lecomte du Nou√ø.LuceafƒÉrul (1914), p.267, 268 The second part of Tzigara's Hermannstadt conference focused on the Romanian school of oil painting. He paid homage to its traditionalist founder, Nicolae Grigorescu, and to Aman, before summarizing the later contributions of »òtefan Luchian, Arthur Verona and Jean Alexandru Steriadi.LuceafƒÉrul (1914), p.268 The third part highlighted his own research of Transylvanian folk art, and spoke about Romania's Queen Elisabeth as a collector of folk art from Sibiu area. Tzigara preserved these principles during the rest of his professional life, and the themes of his conferencing resurface in his old age memoirs. These too shed light on Carol I's architectural role, and express approval for Lecomte de Nou√ø's since- criticized methods of conservation (including the decision to the tear down and rebuild Curtea de Arge»ô Cathedral). They also return to Smigelschi's murals, criticizing his depiction of saints in national Romanian dress as highly inappropriate. =World War I and Germanophilia= August von Mackensen reviewing Austro-Hungarian troops in occupied Bucharest Tzigara's international and scholarly activities suffered from the outbreak of World War I in summer 1914, even though Romania remained neutral until mid-1916. His purported father, Carol I, died in September 1914. According to his Archbishop Netzhammer, Tzigara was deeply affected by the event: \\"Like a child, he loosened his suffering, deploring in front of me this terrible and unexpected loss\\". By then, however, Tzigara had befriended Ferdinand I, the new king, and was an admirer of Ferdinand's wife, Marie of Edinburgh. He found that Ferdinand was \\"gentle\\", \\"jocular\\" and usually self-effacing, \\"in all things the opposite of his uncle\\" Carol I. In Queen Marie, the art historian recognized a political woman, more active in public affairs than Carol's Elisabeth.CiupalƒÉ, p.100 Tzigara also shared Marie's artistic taste, including her passion for the work of Romanian Symbolist sculptors Oscar Sp√§the and Friedrich Storck (whom, in 1903, he had called them \\"innovators of Romanian sculpture\\").»òotropa, p.21 Unlike Ferdinand and his Francophile circle, who desired a Romanian alliance with the Entente for the sake of union with Transylvania, Tzigara was opposed to any move against Germany. He represented the Germanophile lobby within the University of Bucharest, at the same junior level as another substitute professor, Constantin Litzica.Boia, p.108 For a while, he was also co-opted on the leadership committee of the Romanian Writers' Society, but lost his seat there in 1915 (probably owing to his presence among the minority of Germanophile writers).Boia, p.104 The subsequent campaign ended abruptly in southern Romania's invasion by the Central Powers (Germans and their allies). In November 1916, shortly before King Ferdinand and the pro-Entente government retreated to Ia»ôi, they appointed Tzigara-Samurca»ô a custodian of the Crown and Royal Domains, tasked with preventing acts of vandalism on the occupiers' part. He stayed behind in Bucharest and met with August von Mackensen, head of the occupation forces. As a result of this encounter, the Germans asked Tzigara to discuss an offer of collaboration with the senior Conservative Party Germanophiles: Maiorescu, Alexandru Marghiloman, Petre P. Carp. All three refused to openly associate with Mackensen's military rule, but a puppet civilian administration was set up under Carp's disciple Lupu Kostaki.Boia, p.327; Ornea (1998), p.390-393 Carp's reply to Tzigara's proposition is recorded as: \\"Such a thing is of no interest to me; it is nonsense, and at this moment counts as weakness.\\"Ornea (1998), p.391 Maiorescu's deteriorating relationship with Carp was also a factor: Carp flatly refused to attend any meeting where Maiorescu was present, and alienated the other two by stating that King Ferdinand should be deposed.Ornea (1998), p.393 Maiorescu himself explained that it was a question of principle: \\"Tzigara has been proposing this to me, but I did not wish to. If [Mackensen] orders me to go, let him send in armed soldiers to take me.\\"Ion S. Floru, \\"√ént√¢lniri cu Titu Maiorescu\\", in Magazin Istoric, December 1995, p.51 On , the art historian took over as Police chief in occupied Bucharest. This proved to be a highly controversial decision, the consequences of which would harm Tzigara's interwar career. While his political adversaries later alleged that Tzigara had been granted the appointment through German pressures, he himself claimed that Carp and Kostaki had asked him to become involved. Also according to Tzigara, his appointment resolved a practical issue, since his legitimate predecessor, General Alexandru Musta»õƒÉ, could not speak any German. Kostaki's administration also included Litzica, who was puppet Minister of Education in spring 1917. Tzigara personally intervened in the selection of other bureaucrats. In February 1917, he brought writer I. A. Bassarabescu into his Police apparatus, obtaining his release from German internment and appointing him head of division.Boia, p.166 Reportedly, he did the same for philosopher Mircea Florian, who became his Carol I Foundation subordinate.Boia, p.350 As recorded by Archbishop Netzhammer, Alexandru Tzigara-Samurca»ô was open and cooperative in his relationship with the new authorities and the German community. In September 1917, the Romanian scholar greeted Wilhelm II, German Emperor, who was visiting the occupied half of Romania. Reportedly the only Romanian in attendance, he followed Wilhelm to the Curtea de Arge»ô Cathedral, where they both paid their respects to Carol I's tomb.Boia, p.328 Tzigara was also a personal guest at the imperial table, and Wilhelm had several long conversations with him in private. At the end of their encounter, Tzigara received from the emperor's hand a diamond-and-ruby tie pin. Tzigara-Samurca»ô nonetheless had a complex relationship with his German supervisors. He refused to cooperate with them on several occasions, objecting to the creation of a German Institute within the University, and being strongly opposed to the Central Powers' interventions on Bucharest Royal Palace grounds. In late 1916 and early 1917, he was in intense correspondence with Ioan Bianu, a fellow scholar and disillusioned Germanophile, who complained about the German Army pressures on the Romanian Academy and asked Tzigara to intervene on his colleagues' behalf.Boia, p.175-176, 328 On one occasion, as a result of Bianu's plea, Tzigara sent in his policemen to prevent German soldiers from stealing the Academy's firewood reserves.Boia, p.176, 328 Boia argues that the main objective of Tzigara's term, \\"the security of people and property\\", was competently met. The same is noted by Ornea, who cautions: \\"the nude fact of his, all things considered, willing collaboration with the German occupier, is still a litigious issue\\". The Police chief was also critical of his more docile colleagues: as recorded in Marghiloman's diary, Tzigara was present at the October 1917 Ath√©n√©e Palace gala organized by Mackensen (October 1917), but was irritated to find himself in the company of junior bureaucrats who were well liked by the Germans. He referred to this category, which included poet Luca Caragiale, as the \\"nippers\\".Boia, p.203 In December of the same year, Caragiale enraged Tzigara by going over his head: the poet used German connections to obtain Police guards at an official function, after Tzigara had refused to grant his request.Boia, p.203-204 =Collaborationism scandal and late 1920s= In January 1918, while the Ia»ôi authorities were considering a way out of the war, Tzigara-Samurca»ô handed in his resignation to the Germans. A separate peace with the Central Powers followed: in March‚ÄìApril, the new national unity government of Marghiloman reassigned him to the position of Police chief. This posting, made legitimate by King Ferdinand's royal decree, Tzigara kept until November 14, 1918‚Äîthat is, three days after the Armistice with Germany reshuffled Romania's commitments. During the interval, with only 220 forces under his command, he was powerless to deal with the growing protest movement of Romanian Railways workers.V. Liveanu, \\"Note »ôi √ÆnsemnƒÉri. Cu privire la evenimentele din 26(13) decembrie 1918\\", in Studii. RevistƒÉ de Istorie, Nr. 1/1958, p.97 Romania's sudden return to Francophilia had also brought Marghiloman's downfall, described by Tzigara as an anti-Conservative \\"coup d'√©tat\\". Zigu Ornea finds this expression of resentment especially problematic, since, he argued, it meant that Tzigara placed Germanopilia above the establishment of Greater Romania: \\"[he] understood next to nothing from the reality of the wartime political phenomenon.\\" The end of the war signified a slump in Tzigara's career. His imperial tie pin, Boia notes, became a \\"corpus delicti\\" for those accusing Tzigara of treason. Such accusations were given ample exposure in Rector Ion Atanasiu's essay RƒÉtƒÉciri na»õionale (\\"National Ravings\\", 1919), answered to in detail by Tzigara's own pro domo, MƒÉrturisiri silite (\\"Forced Confessions\\", 1920), and later by his posthumously published Memorii (\\"Memoirs\\").Boia, p.328, 353 Athanasiu was the first who suggested holding Tzigara accountable for his wartime behavior, and, in his University report, alluded to the possibility of sacking both him and the Germanophile biologist Victor Babe»ô.Boia, p.353 Ornea finds that, in those years, Athanasiu and Tzigara's traditional foe Nicolae Iorga were waging \\"a veritable war against Tzigara-Samurca»ô\\". Tzigara was omitted from an early purge of University Germanophiles, but, on November 29, 1919, was subjected to questioning by Rector Atanasiu, Iorga and the Board of Professors. As he later recalled, his defense tactic was to recall that, back in 1906, Iorga himself was seen as a radical Francophobe (see SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul).Boia, p.353-354 On Iorga and Atanasiu's proposal, but against the advice of Ion Cantacuzino and Dimitrie Onciul, the Board took a vote to ban Tzigara-Samurca»ô; the result was indecisive, and Tzigara preserved his chair.Boia, p.354, 355-356 Atanasiu however took the vote as evidence that Tzigara had lost his support, and requested a decision from higher authorities. As Boia notes, this was a political miscalculation: the anti-Germanophile lobby had been defeated in Parliament by Prime Minister Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, who could not be expected to grant Atanasiu a victory.Boia, p.354-355 In the end, Education Minister and zoologist Ioan Borcea sent a letter to Atanasiu, asking him to desist frustrating Tzigara \\"in his attributions without legal decision\\", adding: \\"Especially at this moment in time, we find it necessary that peace and harmony be restored for University to function properly.\\"Boia, p.354 These and other moral defeats prompted Atanasiu to present his resignation, which came with his final protest that Minister Borcea had snubbed University during the \\"Tzigara-Samurca»ô affair\\".Boia, p.355 In later years, Tzigara took his main accusers, Iorga and journalist Stelian Popescu, to court, in what became two celebrity trials. As noted by literary critic Dumitru H√Æncu, the art historian's wartime conduct was never censured by the interwar governments. He was again received into Queen Marie's circle, who allegedly told him: \\"Iorga is jealous that he sees you coming over to visit with us.\\" G. T. Kirileanu, \\"1921. Culise regale (V)\\", in Ziarul Financiar, March 9, 2007 Tzigara was still an art columnist for Convorbiri Literare, and, in 1921, became its new editor in chief. According to ASTRA's newspaper, Transilvania, Tzigara rescued Convorbiri from bankruptcy, but only catered to a niche audience. S[evastian] V[oicu], \\"Mi»ôcarea culturalƒÉ. Reviste\\", in Transilvania, Nr. 2/1929, p.158 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) He was thus unable to steer the magazine back into the cultural mainstream, its previous dominance replicated by the left-wing Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ. In 1923, he was the Inspector General of Museums, under the National Liberals' Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu cabinet, in which capacity he revisited the ASTRA Museum and awarded it a 50,000 lei grant from the state. \\"Raportul general. Muzee\\", in Transilvania, Nr. 10-11/1924, p.387-388 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) The period also witnessed his first private visits to the Transylvanian spa town, Sovata.NastasƒÉ (2010), p.244 His main home in Bucharest was a large villa on KogƒÉlniceanu Street, where he was living with his family.NastasƒÉ (2010), p.390 Despite his confirmation at the university, Tzigara-Samurca»ô found it impossible to achieve tenure,Boia, p.356 and was also ousted from the Fine Arts School over his Germanophilia. With the diplomatic recognition of Greater Romania came new opportunity, and, in 1926, Tzigara left for Bukovina, taking over the art history department at CernƒÉu»õi University.Boia, p.356; NastasƒÉ (2007), p.297 Also that year, a mortally ill King Ferdinand made him a Grand Officer of the Order of the Star of Romania. Again touring Germany with a series of conferences (1926), Tzigara also spoke at Radio Berlin, making his debut in radio programming. Reportedly, his request of creating a special Romanian section on Berlin's Museum Island was granted by the Weimar Republic in early 1927. \\"CronicƒÉ mƒÉruntƒÉ\\", in Societatea de M√¢ine, Nr. 3/1927, p.33 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) On November 1, 1928, Alexandru Tzigara-Samurca»ô provided the first-ever Radio Romania broadcast in history, with an art lecture specifically written for this purpose. This, Tzigara recalled, was a pro bono activity to please Radio Romania's president Constantin Angelescu, but made the speaker himself very nervous: Tzigara thought his own text bland and his voice ill-adapted for the medium, but took pains to improve them in later broadcasts. In 1929, Tzigara was a first judge at the original Miss Romania beauty contest, in a panel which also included Vaida-Voevod, writers Liviu Rebreanu and Nicolae Constantin Batzaria, woman activist Alexandrina Cantacuzino and other public figures. Ana ZidƒÉrescu, \\"Miss Rom√¢nia are 80 de ani\\", in Evenimentul Zilei, February 29, 2009 Romanian cabinets appointed him a national representative at the Universal Exposition in Barcelona, Spain, and organizer of the folk art exhibit at the International Peace Bureau's Balkan Conference in Athens, Greece. He also attended the 13th International Congress of Art History in Stockholm, Sweden, and organized the Romanian pavilion at an Art Conference in Helsinki, Finland. His efforts won international recognition, and the French state, through Bucharest Ambassador Gabiel Puaux, presented Tzigara with a gift of S√®vres porcelain. He was also awarded the Order of St. Sava by the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. =1930s= Tzigara's position was threatened in 1930, when Ferdinand's deposed son Carol II retook his throne. It was alleged that Iorga, a supporter of the new king, asked for Tzigara to be removed from the royal Foundation, but that Carol had stated not being willing to sack \\"my own uncle.\\" Iorga was however in a position to limit his rival's access to academia when, in 1931, he became Carol II's Prime Minister. His legislative proposal, limiting the number of academic positions an individual could hold, was probably aimed specifically at Tzigara and other personal enemies (as Lucian NastasƒÉ writes, Iorga was himself collecting some five monthly salaries from his work with the state).NastasƒÉ (2010), p.371 At around the same time, Tzigara became a contributor to the official literary and scientific magazine, Revista Funda»õiilor Regale,NastasƒÉ (2007), p.524 and again toured the country with lectures on folk art. Grigore Bugarin, \\"Stilul clƒÉdirilor publice\\", in Societatea de M√¢ine, Nr. 3/1939, p.103 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) With Simion Mehedin»õi and the ASTRA Society, he returned to the field of public activism with controversial lectures on the biology of the Romanian nation, which sometimes included overt advocacy of eugenics.Maria Bucur, Eugenics and Modernization in Interwar Romania, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, 2002, p.33-34, 169. His racialist theory had it that the geometric abstraction of peasant art, purported to have been strongly resistant to foreign influence, placed Romanians in the \\"Alpine race\\" cluster‚Äîan idea rejected in its day by anthropologist Henric Sanielevici, who contrarily believed that Romanians were \\"Mediterranean\\".H. Sanielevici, \\"Supravie»õuiri din mysterele dionysiace la ereticii din Basarabia\\", in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Nr. 11-12/1930, p.116-118 In 1933, he was briefly affiliated with the Romanian National Socialist Party and its \\"Romanian‚ÄìGerman Cultural Institute\\".Mihai A. Panu, Capcanele ideologiei. Op»õiuni politice ale etnicilor germani √Æn Rom√¢nia interbelicƒÉ, Editura Mega, Cluj-Napoca, 2015, p. 188. Moving away from Germanophilia, Tzigara saluted the Brussels World Fair of 1935 by highlighting the special connection between Romania, on one hand, and, on the other France, Belgium and the Francophone countries. Ioan Stanomir, \\"Imagini »ôi identitate na»õionalƒÉ: piese pentru dosarul unei dezbateri\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 816, October 2005 He spoke on Radio France and the INR (he found the Francophone services to be more relaxing, but less organized, than their German counterpart). In the 1920s and '30s, Tzigara was host to several foreign researchers. Columbia University professor Charles Upson Clark called his institution \\"splendid\\", finding it partly responsible for a \\"distinct revival\\" in peasant crafts.Clark, p.262 He described the museum as \\"a revelation of the artistic endowment of the Roumanian peasant.\\"Clark, p.310 French archivist Fran√ßois de Vaux de Foletier visited his museum in 1934, later writing, in Monde et Voyages magazine, that it featured \\"very interesting galleries of Romanian ethnography\\". Andrei Pippidi, \\"Impresiile unui oaspete francez (II)\\", in Dilema Veche, Nr. 344, September 2010. For the full context of Vaux de Foletier's visit, see \\"Impresiile unui oaspete francez (I)\\", in Dilema Veche, Nr. 343, September 2010. Beginning 1933, Tzigara was several times interviewed by Eugen Wolbe, the German biographer of Romanian kings, who had been sent to him by Carol II. Tzigara also reviewed Wolbe's texts, including his work on Queen Elisabeth (a \\"weak\\" study, in Tzigara's opinion), and described the visiting writer as an unreliable amateur: \\"that pensioned ex-Gymnasiallehrer still had the audacity to select himself such august subjects, with the pretext of 'gaining many new friends for the beautiful country' of Romania, of which yet he himself knew so little!\\" Alexandru Florescu, \\"Istorie »ôi istorii: o biografie a regelui Ferdinand\\" , in Convorbiri Literare, January 2005 Tzigara was upset to receive a copy of Wolbe's 1937 work on Ferdinand, which, he claimed, entirely ignored specific criticism; he also approved of Prime Minister Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu's decision to ban the volume in its Romanian edition (the censoring left Wolbe indifferent, a fact noted in one of his letters to Tzigara). Tzigara's rival Iorga, probably incited by this controversy and by his own work with Wolbe, gave the book a positive review in his journal Neamul Rom√¢nesc, calling the government measure \\"regrettable\\", and receiving further criticism from Tzigara, through Convorbiri. The Carol I Museum increased in size throughout the interwar, organized several exhibits,Longuet, p.146 and, in 1931, inaugurated its Ethnographic Section at the new Kiseleff location. In parallel, Tzigara popularized Romanian handicrafts abroad with his new French-language tract, Tapis Roumains (\\"Romanian Carpets\\").Kurt Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, University of California Press, Berkeley & Los Angeles, 1970, p.233. Other contributions, published by Convorbiri Literare in 1934, include an introduction to Alexandru Odobescu's posthumous texts, Ineditele lui Odobescu (\\"Odobescu's Unpublished Texts\\")CƒÉlinescu, p.996 and an edition of Odobescu' 1895 suicide note.NastasƒÉ (2010), p.442-443 Another work, grouping his articles in defense of the Museum's construction, was published in 1936 as Muzeografie rom√¢neascƒÉ (\\"Romanian Museography\\"). Tzigara and cultural historian Nicolae N. Condeescu also left a monograph on the Pele»ô Castle, Carol I's residence in Sinaia. Dan Arsenie, \\"Povestea polului lui Carol, o monedƒÉ de 100.000 de euro\\", in Evenimentul Zilei, October 30, 2010 As editor of Convorbiri Literare, Tzigara also entered a polemic with a younger Maiorescu disciple, the critic and novelist Eugen Lovinescu. At the root of this debate stood Lovinescu's book on Mite Kremnitz and her affair with national poet (and Junimist herald) Mihai Eminescu. Joining in with other conservatives who accused Lovinescu of being a \\"pornographer\\", Tzigara claimed to defend Eminescu's image from the book's impiety. Gabriela OmƒÉt, \\"Glose la o fotografie: E. Lovinescu ...victimƒÉ a mitului eminescian\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 49/2002 Lovinescu offered his replies in the daily AdevƒÉrul, accusing Tzigara of \\"literary incompetence\\", and deploring the decline of Convorbiri beyond the threshold of professionalism: \\"if, under previous directions, the magazine steered away from its stated mission [...], the deviance was at least made in an honorable direction, that is to say in the direction of history writing; the scientific seriousness of its two former directors had made it possible for Convorbiri to have valid contributions in areas other than literature.\\" \\"AdevƒÉruri de altƒÉdatƒÉ: Reac»õie la o criticƒÉ\\", in AdevƒÉrul, April 13, 2010 In reaction to claims of irreverence, he derided his adversary's artistic expertise as being about \\"Easter eggs\\", and defended his narrative as a sample of respect for Eminescu's life and legacy. Tzigara met significant opposition in his bid for Romanian Academy membership, primarily from Academy member Iorga.Boia, p.356. See also NastasƒÉ (2007), p.510 He was eventually elected a corresponding member in 1938, when Iorga's influence was being challenged by his younger peers. The same year, he was pensioned from his positions at CernƒÉu»õi University and the Foundation.NastasƒÉ (2010), p.409 In 1939, he dedicated himself to completing his homage to the memory of Carol I, on his 100th birthday: Din via»õa regelui Carol I. MƒÉrturii contemporane »ôi documente inedite (\\"From the Life of King Carol I. Contemporary Testimonials and Never-before Published Documents\\"), called \\"splendid\\" by Lucian NastasƒÉ.NastasƒÉ (2007), p.88 He resigned from his editorial office at Convorbiri, which was taken over by writer and linguist I. E. Torou»õiu. Tzigara announced this change with a final editorial piece, which read: \\"Satisfied to have insured the magazine's future, we announce at this moment that we are placing our directorial office in the hands of a new generation, which is led by Professor I. E. Torou»õiu, [...] who with his valuable and sizable published works, appreciating Junimeas role in the movement to renew the Romanian literary language, will know how to carry on the ever-lasting flame of Junimist ideas\\". Cassian Maria Spiridon, \\"Eminescu la 1939\\" , in Convorbiri Literare, January 2004 At that point in life, Tzigara was also pleased with the state and popularity of museology in Greater Romania; in 1937, he had claimed: \\"all the country is presently a museum\\". Tita Chiper, \\"Ce se pƒÉstreazƒÉ?\\", in Dilema, Nr. 347, October 1999 His hostility to open-air museums was by then a thing of the past, since, it was argued, Greater Romania's peasant society seemed threatened by modern urbanization. In the late 1930s, this judgment prompted sociologist Dimitrie Gusti to create the National Village Museum, located a short distance away from Tzigara's own building site. =World War II and final years= A final moment of preeminence in Tzigara's career occurred during World War II. Initially, with war looming, Chief of the Romanian General Staff Florea »öenescu tasked Tzigara with drafting an Ex-ante International Convention Project for the Protection of Monuments and Works of Art, which was never put into motion. In summer 1940, during a period when Carol II was trying to calm tensions between Romania and Nazi Germany, Tzigara, Ion Nistor, Grigore Antipa, Ion S√¢n-Giorgiu and other academics greeted a Nazi visitor, scholar Herbert Cysarz.Frank-Rutger Hausmann, ¬ªAuch im Krieg schweigen die Musen nicht¬´: die Deutschen Wissenschaftlichen Institute im Zweiten Weltkrieg, Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, G√∂ttingen, 2001, p.75-76. After 1940, Romania ousted Carol II's National Renaissance Front government, replacing it with an openly fascist, pro-Axis regime, the National Legionary State. In parallel, Tzigara managed to gather political support for terminating Nicolae Ghica-Bude»ôti's contract and, in 1941, hired architect Gheorghe Ionescu to finalize the Museum's construction. Late in the same year, he was one of the Romanian scholars who welcomed German Romance studies expert Ernst Gamillscheg on his visit to Bucharest. \\"Cronici. Idei, oameni, fapte. √én cinstea d-lui profesor Ernst Gamillscheg\\", in G√¢ndirea, Nr. 9/1941, p.500 (digitized by the Babe»ô- Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) In 1942, he was tasked by Romania's military dictator Ion Antonescu with creating a monumental National Heroes' Cemetery in Carol Park, but the building works were cut short by the reversal of fortunes on the Eastern Front. Edward Pastia, \\"Rom√¢nia nu are bani nici mƒÉcar sƒÉ scrie istoria\\" , in SƒÉptƒÉm√¢na FinanciarƒÉ, August 17, 2007 Also then, he returned to research with a book about the carpets and rugs of Oltenia, which notably stated his ethnic nationalist credo in art: \\"By using the everlasting heritage of our beautiful folk art in different fields, we will be easily able to get rid of the foreign influences that pervaded Romanian households.\\" Shortly after the August 1944 Coup deposed Antonescu, the daily Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, which was at the time a Romanian Communist Party tribune, featured Tzigara's name on a list of \\"national betrayal\\", which also included Germanophile or fascist intellectuals. Cristina Diac, \\"Comunism - Arti»ôti »ôi ziari»ôti √Æn febra epurƒÉrilor\\" , in Jurnalul Na»õional, April 12, 2006 Two years later, the pro-communist cabinet of Petru Groza sidelined Tzigara-Samurca»ô, appointing him honorary director of the museum, but effectively stripping him of his responsibilities. At that stage, plans were being examined for the disestablishment of the Peasant Art Section at the Museum, but Tzigara obtained support from Communist Party man Emil BodnƒÉra»ô and from Presidium Chief Constantin Ion Parhon. Tzigara attended the clandestine meetings of the Mihai Eminescu Association, an anti-communist group formed through the efforts of critic Pavel Chihaia, and which disappeared in 1948. Gheorghe Grigurcu, \\"Destinul unui rezistent: Pavel Chihaia\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 41/2001 His chief activity, from 1948 to 1952, was the writing of his memoirs. The official establishment of Romania's communist regime was the start of several new problems for the aging scholar: many of his belongings were taken away during nationalization, others were sold in public auction, while he himself was taken to court by some of his former employees. In 1948, he was also stripped of his Academy membership.NastasƒÉ (2007), p.511 The following year, his pension was suspended, although, in 1950, he was elected to the International Committee of the History of Art. The National Museum was reopened in 1951 as a \\"National Museum of Folk Art\\", under new management. Marginalization aggravated Tzigara's illnesses, and he died on April 1, 1952. He was buried at Bellu Cemetery, with a small ceremony attended by family and a few of his intellectual friends: Convorbiri colleague Mehedin»õi, Junimist philosopher Constantin RƒÉdulescu-Motru, physician Daniel Danielopolu and writer Gala Galaction.NastasƒÉ (2010), p.470 He had lost his public profile, and the international community was left uninformed of his death: in 1955, an invitation to the 18th Art History Congress was mistakenly addressed to him. Legacy Tzigara's contribution as an art historian has received mixed evaluations. According to Lucian NastasƒÉ, his 1911 course at the Bucharest University was the first professional approach to the subject, after the \\"somewhat organized\\" attempts on Odobescu's part.NastasƒÉ (2007), p.36 Writing in 1920, art historian Gheorghe Oprescu also suggested that, with Nicolae Iorga's reviews, Tzigara's \\"intelligent articles\\" were the only ones in the Romanian press to properly educate the public taste. Charles Upson Clark also rated \\"Tzigara-Samurcash\\" as one of Romania's \\"best-known modern writers\\" in the field of archeology or ancient art, with Alexandru Lapedatu, George Murnu and Abgar Baltazar.Clark, p.301 Contrarily, a later assessment made by ethnologist Romulus VulcƒÉnescu rated both Tzigara, Iorga and Oprescu as authors of \\"ethnological essayistics and cultural microhistory\\", who lacked a global approach to folk art research. Iordan Datcu, \\"Profesorul Alexandru Dima\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 39/2005 Dumitru H√Æncu, writing in 2007, noted that, once \\"a first-rate cultural figure\\", Alexandru Tzigara-Samurca»ô \\"no longer says a great deal for your average present-day reader\\". The art historian's figure inspired literary critic George CƒÉlinescu in writing his novel Scrinul negru, about the decline of Romanian aristocracy. A more unusual trace of his activity is preserved in Tzigara-Samurkasch, the name of a fictional place in the writings of Bukovina native Gregor von Rezzori.Andrei Corbea-Hoi»ôie, \\"Maghrebinien‚Äîein Ged√§chtnisort ex negativo\\", in Jacques Lajarrige (ed.), Austriaca 54: Gregor von Rezzori, University of Rouen, 2003, p.17. A comment left by Tzigara in his Pele»ô Castle book has fueled cyberculture speculation and an urban legend about the existence of 20 lei coins from the 1860s, which are supposedly extremely valuable items. Tzigara- Samurca»ô's Museum building was only finished after his death, later in the 1950s. By the time of its completion, however, the building's purpose had changed, and, historian Andrei Pippidi writes, it \\"passed through the most humiliating of its stages\\". Its collections were moved to a new location, and, in 1978, merged into the Village Museum. The Kiseleff building was assigned to the \\"Lenin-Stalin Museum\\", which later became the Communist Party Museum. Shortly after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 toppled communism, the Salvation Front Minister of Culture Andrei Ple»ôu created, on National Museum grounds, a Museum of the Romanian Peasant, which he placed under the direction of painter Horia Bernea.Longuet, p.146-147 It was officially inaugurated in 1993.Longuet, p.147 Although sometimes described as Tzigara's successor, Bernea, helped by ethnologist Irina Nicolau, merged the scientific function into a conceptual art project, which is described by various commentators as a radical break with the interwar National Museum. Radu Bercea, Ioana Popescu, \\"Scandal la M»öR\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 754, August 2004; VintilƒÉ MihƒÉilescu, Maria Bercea, \\"M»öR e mai mult dec√¢t un muzeu: e o institu»õie culturalƒÉ\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 827, January 2006. See also Longuet, p.146sqq According to Lucian Boia, Tzigara's work with the Germans in World War I continues to be perceived as a stain on his career, and was as such omitted from official histories which deal with the period. This, Boia notes, happened especially during the latter, nationalist, stage of Romanian communism, when World War I was presented as a moment of anti-German \\"unanimity\\".Boia, p.16-17 However, the period also brought the publication of Tzigara's collected Scrieri despre arta rom√¢neascƒÉ (\\"Writings on Romanian Art\\", 1987).»òotropa, p.28; Vlasiu, p.54 The first installment of Tzigara-Samurca»ô's memoirs was first published in 1999, ten years after the Revolution, by Grai »ôi Suflet imprint.Boia, p.328; CiupalƒÉ, p.137, 139, 140; NastasƒÉ (2007), p.37, 91, 103; (2010), p.230 Later volumes saw print with Editura Meridiane. These works have raised interest for their historical and biographical content, but, Zigu Ornea contends, are largely without literary value. Ornea also criticized the two editors, Ioan and Florica »òerb, for only including some citations from Tzigara's contemporaries as notes, instead of a more complete critical apparatus. Editura Vitruviu also published another volume of Tzigara's memoirs, as Lupta vie»õii unui octogenar (\\"An Octogenarian's Lifelong Combat\\", 2007). A large part of his photographic plates ended up as a special fund of the Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism. In May 2010, they were inventoried and published, in print and DVD format, as Arhiva Alexandru Tzigara-Samurca»ô. A selection of these works was displayed in 2011, during a special Museum of the Romanian Peasant exhibit, sponsored by the Romanian Cultural Institute. The rest, preserved by the Fine Arts School, were donated to the Museum of the Romanian Peasant in 2000. A Tzigara-Samurca»ô Foundation was created with the goal of preserving folklore and handicrafts. Its projects include the revival of Ocna »òugatag hore Speran»õa RƒÉdulescu, \\"SƒÉ pofteascƒÉ tot poporul\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 179, April July 2003 and the Ethnophone folk music events, sponsored by the European Union's Culture 2000.List of Euroart approved projects.

It was widely copied elsewhere, particularly in France. History During the early 1840s Alexander Allan and William Buddicom of the Grand Junction Railway (GJR) created the design incorporating inclined outside cylinders and a double frame. It was built due to combat the frequent failure of crank axles on contemporary inside cylinder locomotive designs. The earliest examples were built by Buddicom at Chartreux for the Chemins de Fer de l'Ouest in 1844 where the type became known as 'Le Buddicom'. The first British examples were built at Crewe Works in 1845 by the GJR and from 1846 by the GJR's successor, the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), with a 2-2-2 wheel arrangement for passenger classes and 2-4-0 for freight. The first of these GJR 2-2-2 locomotives, Columbine, is preserved at the Science Museum in London. It carried GJR fleet number 49, and was withdrawn from service in 1902 by the LNWR, carrying their number 1868.

Her father, a manager at a soap factory, had immigrated to Argentina from the Russian Empire to escape anti-Semitism and poverty through the sponsorship of philanthropist and banker, Maurice de Hirsch. Lerer was born in the Santa Catalina colonyZalmen Zylbercweig, Leksikon fun Yidishn teater, Book three, 2259 in Argentina on August 30, 1915. Lerer was discovered in Buenos Aires by Yiddish theater legend, producer and actor Boris Thomashefsky, who was starring in the area, when she was just five or eight years old, at the recommendation of her sister (the actress Miryam Lerer). At ten she was participating in Yakov Botashanski's productions in a theater circle. When she was older, she studied at a Spanish-language drama school and performed for three years on the Argentinian stage. She then passed the examinations for the actors' union and became a member, playing with the star Miryam Karalova- Kambarov, then Moyshe Oysher and Florence Weiss, finally playing in serious drama roles with Zygmunt Turkow in Urteyl, Hirsh Lekert, Ivan Kruger and Di glokn-tsier fun Notr-dam (The Bell-ringer (Hunchback) of Notre Dame).

Life Shaw was the son of Robert Shaw, A.M., master of the grammar school at Lichfield. After passing some years of professional life at Scarborough, he was practising physic in London in 1726, apparently without a degree or the licence of the Royal College of Physicians, but did not permanently settle there until some years later. On 25 June 1740 he was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians, being then a doctor of medicine, but of what university is not recorded. In London he attained popularity as a physician. He was patronised by Sir Edward Hulse, one of the court physicians, at that point gradually withdrawing from practice. He was admitted a candidate at the College of Physicians on 16 April 1753, and was made a fellow on 8 April of the following year. In 1752 he was appointed physician-extraordinary to George II, and the same year was created doctor of medicine at Cambridge by royal mandate. Two years later he was promoted to be physician-in-ordinary to the king, and he was the usual medical attendant on George II in his journeys to Hanover. He was nominated to the same office on the accession of George III. He died on 15 March 1763, aged 69 years, and was buried in the nave of Wimbledon church, where there was an inscription to his memory. Works He contributed to the study of chemistry in England by his translations of the works of Georg Ernst Stahl and Herman Boerhaave, as well as his own writings and lectures. Shaw was prolific if careless. He was editor of the works of Francis Bacon and Robert Boyle.His edition of The Philosophical Works of the Hon.

Thousands of young men were incarcerated in Stalag VIIIB, in Lamsdorf, by the Germans during World War II. Evans recounted these experiences both in his book, as well as on his website, Lamsdorf Remembered. The website was created due to public response from the children and grandchildren of former inmates of Stalag VIIIB, the website originally named Lamsdorf Reunited was created to record stories and photographs from that experience. Evans encountered the respected RAF pilot Douglas Bader while at Stalag VIIIB, and talked about his escape attempts in his book. Evans himself is mentioned in a book called POW: Allied Prisoners in Europe, 1939‚Äì1945 by Adrian Gilbert who used Sojourn in Silesia for his information. Evans was a member of The National Ex-Prisoner of War Association, whose patron is Dame Vera Lynn, DBE, LLD, M.MUS, and is mentioned in the August 2001 newsletter. More recently, on his website Lamsdorf Remembered, a half-hour Radio Kent interview with Evans was published, as well as a blog called Letters from Stalag VIIIB, which is made up of Evans' letters home during his four years as a prisoner-of-war. The blog was published as a book in February 2014 by Evans' daughter Kathryn Gower. Life Arthur Charles Evans was born in 1916 in the Wirral, Cheshire. The first years of his employment were at Lever Brothers, soapworks at Port Sunlight, and then with the New Zealand Shipping Company. One voyage to Australia and then another to New Zealand convinced him he was not meant to be a sailor. To further his ambition to become a policeman, he enlisted in the Irish Guards in 1936. In May 1940, he was wounded and taken prisoner in Bolougne and spent the remainder of the war in prison camps in Upper Silesia. He returned to England in May 1945 and upon demobilisation, joined the Kent County Constabulary. Evans was a friend of James Callaghan and his wife Audrey Callaghan, Baroness Callaghan of Cardiff, whom he had met when Callaghan was Parliamentary Adviser to the Police Federation from 1955 to 1960. They worked together during that time on negotiations for an increase in police pay. Whilst still a police constable Arthur was Secretary of the Police Federation from 1956 to 1967 and it was in this capacity that he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) on 1 January 1967. In an article dated 19 August 1966, Police Federation Secretary Arthur Evans complained that, because of the old anti-gun tradition, \\"you could count on the fingers of one hand police trained in the use of firearms.\\" Evans was also responsible for policemen finally being allowed to buy their own homes. Up until then, they were at the mercy of the Chief Constables and being moved around the country. In May 1967, Evans organised and headed up the British contingent at The World Congress of Police Officers in Niagara Falls, Canada. He later returned to police work in Sevenoaks, Dover, Whitstable and Herne Bay, his last position being as an Inspector in 1970. He later became the chief of administration at Ashford Police Station (Ashford, Kent), a position he held until 1981. He was married to his wife Freda for 62 years, and they had three daughters, Gillian, Kathryn and Vivienne, five grandchildren and three great grandchildren. He retired aged 65, and spent much of his time gardening, bowling and cooking in his Kent home, and in later years caring for Freda. Freda who had Alzheimer's for many years, died peacefully on 2 June 2016. Evans died of natural causes on 18 March 2011. He left a request for some of the profit from Sojourn in Silesia to go to the British Red Cross.

Background  The Liberal Party of Australia-Country Party of Australia coalition had governed in Australia since 1949 under Prime Minister Robert Menzies. Menzies retired in January 1966 and the Liberal Party elected Harold Holt as party leader and he became Prime Minister of Australia.  Terms in office  ABC video of Holt Government's conversion to decimal currency. After being elected by the Parliamentary Liberal Party to serve as leader and Prime Minister, Harold Holt led the coalition to victory in the November 1966 Australian Federal Election against the Australian Labor Party opposition led by Arthur Calwell. The Coalition won a substantial majority ‚Äì the Liberals winning 61 seats and the Country Party 21 ‚Äì with the Labor Party winning 41 and 1 Independent in the Australian House of Representatives (representing the largest parliamentary majority in 65 years). Following the 1966 election, Gough Whitlam replaced Arthur Calwell as Leader of the Opposition. During his time in office, Holt increased Australian commitment to the growing War in Vietnam. His government oversaw conversion to decimal currency. Holt faced Britain's withdrawal from Asia by visiting and hosting many Asian leaders and by expanding ties to the United States, hosting the first visit to Australia by an American president, his friend Lyndon Johnson. Holt's government introduced the Migration Act 1966, which effectively dismantled the White Australia Policy and increased access to non-European migrants, including refugees fleeing the Vietnam War. Holt also called the 1967 Referendum which removed the discriminatory clause in the Australian Constitution which excluded Aboriginal Australians from being counted in the census ‚Äì the referendum was one of the few to be overwhelmingly endorsed by the Australian electorate (over 90% voted 'yes'). By the end of 1967, the Liberals' initially popular support for the war in Vietnam was causing increasing public protest.  Death of Holt  On 17 December 1967, Holt disappeared in heavy surf while swimming off Cheviot Beach, near Melbourne, becoming the third Australian Prime Minister to die in office. He was not formally declared missing until 19 December. Country Party leader John McEwen served as Prime Minister from 19 December 1967 to 10 January 1968, pending the election of a new leader of the Liberal Party of Australia. McEwen ruled out maintaining the Coalition if deputy liberal leader William McMahon became Prime Minister. John Gorton won the leadership election with a small majority and resigned from the Senate to stand for election to Higgins, the House of Represensatives seat formerly held by Harold Holt, which he achieved on 24 February 1968.

He was the eldest son of George Seton, 6th Lord Seton and Elizabeth Hay, a daughter of John Hay, 3rd Lord Hay of Yester. His childhood and schooling were in France. Political career =Edinburgh and the Reformation= George Seton was Provost of Edinburgh in 1557, and from time to time would send his carpenter, Robert Fendour or Fender, to the Burgh Council as his representative. In February 1558, George Seton was one of eight commissioners sent to Henry II of France to negotiate the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, to the Dauphin.Ritchie, Pamela, Mary of Guise (Tuckwell: East Linton, 2002), pp. 190-1. On 29 November 1558, the Parliament of Scotland acknowledged that Seton and the others had fulfilled their commission. In February 1559, the town council gave him funds to prepare a banquet for Mary of Guise on their behalf.Extracts from the records of the Burgh of Edinburgh (Edinburgh, 1875), 3 Feb. 1559, 22 April 1559. However, Seton and the burgh council began to encounter difficulties, due only in part to the Scottish Reformation. After rioting in Perth, Edinburgh was occupied by the Protestant Lords of the Congregation in June 1559. Seton tried unsuccessfully to protect the Blackfriars and Greyfriars monasteries. The Protestant Lords left Edinburgh in July, but made an agreement with Guise permitting freedom of conscience in religion. Seton, the Earl of Huntly and Ch√¢tellerault were asked to meet the people of Edinburgh to discuss the restoration of Mass in St Giles. According to John Knox, they met with refusal and the people would not allow the Mass in any other church.Knox, John, The History of the Reformation, bk. 2: Laing, David, ed., 'John Knox's 'History of the Reformation', Books 1 & 2,' The Works of John Knox, vol. 1 (Bannatyne Club, Edinburgh, 1846), pp. 362-3, 389-391. By the time the Lords of the Congregation occupied Edinburgh for the second time in October 1559, another rival council had already formed, led by Archibald Douglas of Kilspindie. The Protestant lords retreated and Seton's council was re-instated. When the English army mobilised by the Treaty of Berwick arrived in April 1560, Kilspindie's council was back in power.Lynch, Michael, Edinburgh and the Reformation (John Donald, Edinburgh, 1981), pp. 75-81, Lynch argues that the council's problems were largely unrelated to Reformation pressures. During the Siege of Leith in 1560, Seton fought for Mary of Guise against the Scottish Protestants and the English army. On 24 April he attacked the English camp at Restalrig. He was seized by an English cavalryman who broke his sword and staff, but was rescued by French musketeers.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 377, no. 748. After the treaty of Edinburgh concluded the fighting, Seton sailed to France with the evacuees aboard the Mynyon.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, p. 1898), 455. In Paris in October 1560, he secretly met the English ambassador, Nicolas Throckmorton, asking him for a passport to return to Scotland through England. He managed to convince Throckmorton that he regretted his service to Mary of Guise and French causes. Seton had gained a French pension as a gentleman of the King's Chamber. He intended to take a portrait of Queen Mary and her letter to Elizabeth, but Mary disappointed him of this mission, saying the picture was not ready. Seton left France in November 1560, accompanied by an archer of the Scottish Guard called Alexander Clark, whose loyalty Throckmorton thought he had bought.Calendar State Papers Foreign, Elizabeth: 1560-1561, vol. 3 (London, 1865), p. 368 no. 665, para. 5; pp. 409-10 no. 737; p. 411 no. 740. =Mary in Scotland= During the personal reign of Mary in Scotland George had a loyal inscription set in large carved letters and gilded above the entrance to Seton Palace; > \\"UN DIEU, UN FOY, UN ROY, UN LOY\\" > One God for all time: One loyalty to the monarch.Maitland, (1829), 57-8. Lord Seton had dies made to strike gold and silver medals with the same motto, and a monogram with his initials and those of his wife, Isobel Hamilton, \\"GS- IH,\\" with another motto \\"Nemo Potest Duobus Dominus Servire,\\" from Matthew 6:24, \\"No one can serve two masters.\\"Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1877), pp. 227-8: British Museum Collection database: Search for Michaell Gilbert (sic). Mary was unsuccessful in proposing Seton as Provost of Edinburgh again in October 1561. Next year she made a better choice by backing Archibald Douglas (II) of Kilspindie, now associated with the success of the Reformation.Lynch, Michael, Edinburgh and the Reformation (John Donald, Edinburgh, 1981), pp. 98, 103. In March 1565, Seton fought a duel with Francis Douglas who was badly injured. The Earl of Morton and the Laird of Lethington tried to take legal action so Seton went to France.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.2 (1900), p.136 no.157 Thomas Randolph, the English diplomat, heard that Mary and Lord Darnley went to Seton Palace and were \\"bedded\\" after their marriage at Holyroodhouse.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 181 no. 208. Seton returned to Scotland in October 1565, during the Chaseabout Raid. He carried arms from France for Queen Mary. An English ship, the Aid tried to blockade Leith to prevent him docking, but was repulsed. Seton's cargo included three great horses for Darnley.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. 214, 220-1, 247. Days after the death of Lord Darnley, on 17 February 1567, Mary had a blue costume for her fool called George Steven delivered to her at Seton Palace, in April she was there with her council.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1970), pp. 42, 52, 398. With other supporters of Mary's marriage to James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell Seton signed the Ainslie Tavern Bond on 19 April 1567. Mary's marriage and continued rule in Scotland was opposed by the Confederate Lords. Mary stayed at Seton Palace before her capture nearby at the battle of Carberry Hill. She was then imprisoned at Lochleven Castle. She escaped to Seton's castle at Niddry but her supporters were defeated again at the battle of Langside. Seton was taken prisoner and early reports thought him killed. The son of Lord Ochiltree, John Knox's brother-in-law, would have killed him in revenge for his father's injury, but he yielded and was saved by James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. 405-7 nos. 653-655. Queen Mary went into England, where her companion, Seton's half-sister Mary Seton quickly joined her. With the other Marian lords Seton was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle where Mary was worried that he was at risk from plague.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. 515, 525. Seton was finally allowed to go into exile in France. Elizabeth I of England sent him a passport on 1 June 1569.Maitland, The History of the House of Seytoun (1829), p. 56: Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 650 no. 1068. =Supporter of the exiled queen= George, Lord Seton, and his family, painted 1572 by Frans Pourbus the Elder while Seton was in the Spanish Netherlands. Three Scottish supporters of Mary, the Duke of Ch√¢tellerault, the Earl of Huntly and Earl of Argyll gave Seton a commission to treat with the Duke of Alba, Viceroy of Lower Germany, as Mary's ambassador in August 1570. Seton was to ask for Spanish help to re-instate Mary in Scotland and expel her son's supporters who depended on English power. Alba would send money to Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange to continue holding Edinburgh Castle for Mary.Cameron, Annie I., The Warrender Papers, vol. 1 (SHS, 1931), pp. 98-9: CSP Scotland, vol. 3, no. 408. In September 1570, Lord Morley met him in the household of Katherine Neville, the Countess of the exiled Earl of Northumberland at Bruges. Seton told Morley that he had come to escort the Countess, who had previously sought refuge in Scotland, into France.HMC Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House, vol. 1 (London, 1883), p. 483 nos. 1517-1518. The author of the Historie and Life of James the Sext, recorded what must have been a popular account of the mission to the Duke of Alba. Seton tried to convince Alba to provide an army of 10,000 men by persuading the Scottish soldiers fighting against Spain to change sides. The soldiers were unresponsive until Seton himself was captured and tortured on the rack. The soldiers then mutinied only till he was released. There was an offer of money, but Alba could not spare the men, and Seton's mission was unsuccessful.Historie and Life of James the Sext, Bannatyne Club (1825), 61-63: See also HMC Salisbury, vol. 1 (1883), 324 no. 1070, a Flemish receipt to Seton for the exchange of 10,000 crowns each of 40 stuivers, of uncertain date, calendared as (?1565). Meanwhile in Scotland, the goods of his French stepmother, Marie Pieris, and half-brother Robert Seton were seized by Regent Moray's officers.Accounts of the Lord Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 12 (1970), 216. In January 1572, Seton was in the Spanish Netherlands with the Duke of Alba and still in contact with the Countess of Northumberland. Seton's return to Scotland through England prompted thorough searches of Scottish shipping in English waters.HMC Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield, vol. 2 (London, 1888), xlviii, 4 no. 8, 7 no. 16, 39 no. 103. In April 1572, the Marshall of Berwick upon Tweed, Sir William Drury, plotted with Mr Archibald Douglas to kidnap Seton on his return from the shore at Leith at night and take him to England, but the plan did not take effect after Douglas was arrested by Regent Mar.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 297. An Italian called Battista di Trento wrote a long letter to Elizabeth I of England in 1577, which alleged to reveal a plot some years earlier involving Seton and his sons, including Alexander, then a student in Rome. As part of the Ridolfi Plot, Mary would have married the Duke of Norfolk and be restored to the Scottish throne. Seton would pay to secure Edinburgh Castle on her behalf. Elizabeth would marry the Earl of Leicester. Battista laid out five schemes for the plot and the 19th century editor of William Cecil's papers believed his circumstantial details to show some \\"sub- stratum of truth\\" in his statements.HMC, Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield, vol. 2 (1888), v-vi, 165-170 no. 491, (p. 168-9) Italian. In May 1579, during the suppression of the Hamilton family, Lord Seton and three of his sons were ordered to enter ward at Brechin Castle. Seton pleaded with the King's keepers at Stirling Castle to mitigate their charge of treason. His son John Seton of Barnes, known as the 'Cavalier de Bucca' from his post at the Spanish court, had returned to Scotland and was suspected to have brought messages from the exiled Queen Mary.HMC, Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield, vol. 2 (1888), pp. 256-7 no. 732, Occurrents out of Scotland, 14 May 1579. On 2 June 1581, Seton and two of his sons watched the execution of Regent Morton from a forestair on the Royal Mile of Edinburgh.Hewitt, George, Scotland under Morton( John Donald, Edinburgh, 1982), p. 202. =Ambassador in France, 1583= After the collapse of the Gowrie Regime, Seton was sent as ambassador to France in December 1583. He was accompanied by William Schaw, Master of Works to James VI of Scotland. An English observer heard that the young Laird of Fintry, a Catholic, would accompany them to escape his excommunication from the Church of Scotland, and the Master of Livingston would go to bring Catherine, Duchess of Lennox, widow of Esm√© Stewart, and her son Ludovic back to Scotland. A French diplomat, Fran√ßois de Rocherolles, Seigneur de Maineville, according to Sir Robert Bowes, was behind the mission and the choice of Lord Seton.Stevenson, David, The Origins of Freemasonry (CUP, 1988), pp. 28-9, 94: Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 6, (London, 1910), pp. 649, 652; vol. 7, p. 4. When he was selected for this embassy in September 1583, Seton wrote to Queen Mary from Seton Palace to explain his mission. He said he was to continue the league and amity with France, follow the advice of the Duke of Guise, and complete the treaty with her and her son. However, he wrote, her service was his principal motive. He explained that the poverty of King James was \\"so great that he could not carry out the least part of his plans.\\" Seton had to pay for the voyage himself. He also mentioned that the English envoy Francis Walsingham had left Scotland on 15 (or 25) September 1583, and had a very poor reception and entertainment in Scotland.Clifford, Arthur, ed., Sadler State Papers, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1809), p. 374, no. XVII: CSP Scotland, vol. 6, (London, 1910), pp. 614-5 no. 642. Seton was funded in part by the town of Edinburgh, who gave him a commercial mandate and contributed 2000 marks to hiring of Andrew Lamb's ship.Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1573-1589 (Edinburgh, 1882), pp. 312, 316, 318-20, The Scottish embassy was keenly observed by the English diplomat, Sir Edward Stafford. Stafford noted Seton's audience with the French king in February 1584, supported by the Dukes of Guise and Joyeuse. Stafford said that Seton was lavish in his entertainment and display of silver plate, which resulted in a suspicion that he was funded by Spain. He thought that Seton's mission concerned a marriage for James VI to the Princess of Lorraine. By May 1584, Seton had run out of money and pawned his silver plate and the guns of the ship at Dieppe. Seton asked Stafford about the rebel leaders of the Raid of Ruthven who had fled into England, and Stafford wrote to Francis Walsingham that Seton was foolish in this conversation.HMC Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield, vol. 3 (London, 1889), pp. 22-32. On 21 June 1584, Stafford remarked in another letter that Seton's phrases echoed those of Mary, Queen of Scots, and it was clear the two maintained frequent communication.Murdin, Cecil State Papers (London, 1759), p. 409. After Seton's return to Scotland, de Maineville wrote to James VI in November 1584 that Seton had been earnest in this embassy (to reconcile Mary and James VI), but the time was not right. Primarily, France was anxious to maintain good relations with England.Cameron, Annie I., ed., The Warrender Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1931), pp. 167-169: See also, Mackie, J. D., 'Scotland and the Spanish Armada,' Scottish Historical Review, vol. XII, no. 45 (October 1914), pp. 1-23. Death and epitaph Seton remained in France till July 1585 or later. The Jesuit Robert Parsons wrote that he was uncertain whether to return or just send his son Alexander back to Scotland. (Although the ultra-Protestant Gowrie Regime was defeated, the political situation in Scotland was not as Seton had hoped) Back in Scotland, in January Sir John Colville twice noted him as ill in his letters, and he died in February 1586.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 7 (Edinburgh, 1913), pp. 235, 533, 547, 562. On 22 June 1586, his son Alexander, Prior of Pluscarden, returned to Edinburgh council copies of their papers regarding French import duties sent with George to Henry II.Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh, 1573-1589, (1882), 463-4. George was buried at Seton Collegiate Church and his memorial has a lengthy Latin epitaph which also describes his children's careers. The Latin text is signed 'A.S.F.C.F.F.,' presumably referring to Alexander Seton as its author.Grose, Francis, The Antiquities of Scotland, vol. 2 (1789), 66: \\"Alexander Setonus Fermelinoduni Comes Fieri Fecit.\\" Family He married Isobel Hamilton, daughter of Sir William Hamilton of Sanquhar, Captain of Edinburgh Castle in August 1550. The wedding was celebrated with a feast at Edinburgh Castle.Michael Pearce, 'A French Furniture Maker and the 'Courtly Style' in Sixteenth-Century Scotland', Regional Furniture, vol. 32 (2018), pp. 131-2. According to Richard Maitland, Hamilton of Sanquhar organised some of the rebuilding of Seton Palace, which had been damaged by the Engliah army that burnt Edinburgh in May 1544. Richard Maitland & Viscount Kingston, History of the House of Seytoun (Glasgow, 1829), pp. 37, 39, 42-45. The children of Lord Seton and Isobel Hamilton included; # George, Master of Seton, (died 1562) # Robert Seton, 1st Earl of Winton # Sir John Seton of Barnes, attendant to the Earl of Leicester in 1575,CSP Scotland, vol.5 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 120.

Lord Seton's painter An anonymous portrait of Lord Seton was kept by the family of Hugh Somerville, 7th Lord Somerville, and is now part of the collection of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. It shows him with his baton of office as Master of Queen Mary's household, and may have been a commemorative piece made in later decades. The picture is reduced in size and the last figure of a date \\"157-\\" is missing. A motto on this painting, \\"in adversity, unyielding; in prosperity generous,\\" matches an inscription recorded under a version of the painting at Seton Palace by Alexander Seton, 1st Viscount of Kingston; \\"In adversity patiens; in prosperitie, benevolus; Hazard yet forward.\\"Maitland, (1829), 58. This portrait has been attributed to Adrian Vanson. In January 1582, a painter in his employ, \\"Lord Seton's painter\\", was paid for drawing the King's portrait for coinage. This painter may perhaps have been Adrian Vanson or Arnold Bronckorst, who were both portrait painters to James VI, or a third individual.Thomson, Duncan, Painting in Scotland, 1570-1650 (Edinburgh, 1975), pp. 31-3. Seton was also painted in a family group by Frans Pourbus the Elder, now in the National Gallery of Scotland. The 18th century heraldic writer Alexander Nisbet described some of his additions to the interior of Seton Palace. Above the fireplace in the Great Hall were carved his coat of arms quartered with the Earl of Buchan encircled with a collar which Nisbet claimed to represent the Order of the Thistle. The ceiling of another room, called Samson's Hall, incorporated 28 armorial achievements of families of France, Scotland and Lorraine, \\"curiously embossed and illuminated.\\"Nisbet, Alexander, A System of Heraldry, vol. 1 (reprint, 1984), 'Of Celestial Figures etc.,' p. 234. Viscount Kingston mentions seeing a mural painting on the end wall of the Long Gallery at Seton Palace, which he believed showed Lord Seton driving a wagon during his years of exile in France following the abdication of Mary, Queen of Scots.Maitland, (1829), p. 58.

Pension regulation varies widely from one jurisdiction to another - notably due to the persistence of discrepancies in the degree of autonomy and breadth of authority and discretionary power that national and regional pension regulators have at their disposal to enforce efficiently existing laws and regulations, in relation with local judicial practices and varying jurisprudential trends. Pension regulation seeks to provide the various norms and standards needed to foster market efficiency, consistency, transparency and accountability across the pension industry; it is a key driver of pension funds' risk management. In Europe, in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, some pension experts such as Anton van Nunen have argued that excessive or misplaced regulatory activism can sometimes have negative unintended consequences, notably when it comes to the strict enforcement of asset liability matching in times high market volatility and the systematic use of bonds-based risk metrics across all asset classes.  Kinds of pensions  = Voluntary or mandatory = * Pension is voluntary, when employers are not required to offer a pension, and in case they do it, they have the right to decide about the volume and choose a type of pension. * Mandatory pension system obliges all citizens to make pension savings. = Universal or Means tested = * In case of universal pension every citizen gets a pension starting with a certain age. * Means-tested social pensions are those where eligibility is based on a test of the income of an individual. = PAYG or funded = * PAYG (pay-as-you-go) is when current contributions paid for current pensions. * Funded system means that each individual's contributions pay directly for their pension benefits. = Defined benefit (DB) or defined contribution (DC) = This characteristic defines a party bearing a risk. * Defined benefit: a person is provided with specified payments after retirement.

These are usually set-up in areas of high expatriate areas to gain maximum sales or on-line. Unlike an ethnic grocer which tends to sell a mixture of products and goods, an expatiate delicatessen tends to sell items from one particular place such as Portugal or region like Eastern Europe. As they are specialised food stores, they charge high prices (usually several times their value) due to a lack of competition, high local duties and low orders from their suppliers. They also sometimes sell items in relation to the area like cooking equipment or native-language media that are hard to find in regular shops. Items Examples of the items that are sold in these stores such as in an American expatriate delicatessen are Lucky Charms breakfast cereal, 3 Musketeers, Hershey's chocolate and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups confectionery, Fluff marshmallow spread, A1 steak sauce and Mountain Dew fizzy drink, while a Polish store sells jarred bigos, sauerkraut, gherkins, smetana and kielbasa wiejska sausage. Such items are usually either directly imported from the country or ordered through grey market importers.

He was the founder of the Fascio dei lavoratori (Workers League) in his hometown Santo Stefano Quisquina, editor of the newspaper La Plebe and member of the Comitato della Federazione Regionale Socialista. He was killed by the Sicilian Mafia. Early years Born in Santo Stefano Quisquina in the Province of Agrigento, he became a primary school teacher and an artist. His great passion was painting and the other was politics. Panepinto, nemico del feudo Panepinto, nemico del feudo, La Sicilia, May 17, 2009 In 1889 he was elected city councilor in the democratic-republican group inspired by Giuseppe Mazzini, challenging the traditional powers. The latter reacted vehemently by dissolving the council and replace it with a Royal Commissioner. Nevertheless, the move failed to prevent a second defeat of the conservatives in the elections of August 1890. The government of Antonio di Rudini again dissolved the council and appointed a new Commissioner. Panepinto resigned in protest and dedicated himself to teaching and painting. Organizing the peasantry He married and moved to Naples. Returning to Sicily in 1893, he noted the state of turmoil caused by the movement of the Fasci Siciliani. He set up the Fascio in Santo Stefano Quisquina, which was dissolved after only a few months by the Government of Francesco Crispi, who violently repressed the movement in January 1894. In the same year Panepinto joined the Italian Socialist Party. In an act of political reprisal, he was dismissed from his post of elementary school teacher by the municipality. Not discouraged, he continued to study pedagogy and educational methodologies and published two didactic volumes in 1897. In the early 20th century, with the resumption of agricultural strikes, Panepinto joined other peasant leaders like Bernardino Verro from Corleone and Nicola Alongi from Prizzi. They designed a change of strategy of political struggle, aiming to organise peasants in collective leaseholds through cooperatives and agricultural banks, to reduce dependence on the leaseholders (gabelloto) of the large rural estates. Omicidio Panepinto, nessun colpevole, La Sicilia, June 12, 2005 In the United States In 1907 he traveled to the United States. Many townspeople from San Stefano Quisquina had emigrated to the United States, in particular to Tampa, Florida, where they worked in the cigar-making industry.Debouzy, In the Shadow of the Statue of Liberty, pp. 123-24 They had left their country, but not their radical ideas. They fitted in seamlessly with the labour culture of workers from Spanish and Cuban origin in the struggle for better labour conditions.Reed, A Companion to American Immigration, p. 401 But they also financially supported the setting up of the agricultural cooperative Unione agricola in their original hometown San Stefano Quisquina in 1902. They invited Panepinto for a trip that would last eight months. Death On May 16, 1911, he was assassinated in Santo Stefano Quisquina, just before the entrance of his house, with two gunshots in the chest. At the funeral, over 4,000 people followed the open coffin in procession. His killers were identified among the gabelloti with links to the Mafia, but the material killer was released by the Court of Catania in April 1914. No one has ever been convicted for the crime. In Tampa the most popular socialist group of the city adopted his name after Panepinto's assassination. The group pledged a yearly stipend of 1,200 lire to the socialist section in their former hometown for work among the peasantry In October 1920, the socialists of Santo Stefano Quisquina managed to conquer the city hall again, electing as mayor Giuseppe Cammarata, Panepinto's friend and collaborator, who continued the battle.

NFI is a non-profit, government funded organisation affiliated with the International Netball Federation (INF), the Asian Federation of Netball Association (AFNA) and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and recognised by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. NFI was established in 1978 to standardise rules and regulations and to promote and develop the growth of netball in India. NFI operates all the Indian national representative netball sides, including the India national netball team and youth sides as well. NFI is also responsible for organising and hosting netball tournaments within India and scheduling the home international fixtures. Vagish Pathak is the current president of the organisation. History The game of Netball was introduced in India by evangelist Dr. Harry Crowe Buck of Pennsylvania, United States in 1920 at the YMCA College of Physical Education of Madras (now Chennai). NFI was established in 1978 by Mr. Jagat Singh Lohan(Chauhan) from Rohtak, Haryana who was an alumnus of YMCA College of Physical Education of Madras (now Chennai) and in the same year he organised the first national championships in Jind, Haryana with great contribution of Mrs. Shashi Prabha. Mr. Jagat Singh Lohan was founder/father of Handball, Netball and Throwball games in India. His efforts in Germany during Munich Olympics (1972) helped in making these a legacy in India. NFI and netball associations of Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka met during the 1983 Netball World Championships in Singapore to discuss the creation of an Asian netball governing body, which resulted in the establishment of Asian Federation of Netball Associations in 1986 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Background LaMonte was born and grew up in Manhattan, New York. In 1990, after she graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) with a Bachelor in Fine Arts with honors, LaMonte was awarded a fellowship at the Creative Glass Center of America, in Millville, New Jersey. Following that, she moved to Brooklyn, New York, and worked at UrbanGlass, a not-for-profit public access glass studio. During this period, she pursued artwork in blown and cast glass, pieces of which were exhibited at fine art galleries. In 1999, LaMonte won a Fulbright scholarship to study at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague, where, in 2000, she created her first major work, Vestige. She soon gained critical acclaim; among the accolades she received were The Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Biennial Award in 2001 and the UrbanGlass Award for New Talent in Glass in 2002. In 2006, the Japan United States Friendship Commission awarded her a seven-month fellowship to study in Kyoto, Japan; this trip inspired her Floating World series of works. In 2009, LaMonte began a collaboration with the Kholer Artist Center at the Corning Museum of Glass where she was named to the museum's Joint Artist-In- Residence Program. In 2017, the Corning Museum and Corning Inc. appointed her the Specialty Glass Artist-In-Residence at Corning's scientific research laboratory. Several of her works are part of the Corning Museum's permanent collection. In 2015, LaMonte received the Masters of the Medium award from the James Renwick Alliance. Her works have been exhibited at museums including the Czech Museum of Fine Art in Prague, the Chrysler Museum of Art in Norfolk, Virginia, and the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Washington. Her works are also included in the permanent collections of The Smithsonian Museum of American Art, Renwick Gallery, Washington DC, The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, M. H. de Young Memorial Museum, the Mus√©e des Arts d√©coratifs, Paris, France, and The National Gallery of Australia, Canberra. LaMonte lives and works in Prague, Czech Republic, with Steve Polaner, her husband and studio manager.  Artwork  Vestige by Karen LaMonte. During her Fulbright year, LaMonte began to work at glass casting studios in Eastern Bohemia (a region associated with Stanislav Libensk√Ω and Jaroslava Brychtov√°). In these studios, she developed Vestige, a cast glass life-size sculpture of a dress with the wearer absent; the work took one year to complete and required the development of special technologies, including the introduction of the lost wax technique to Czech glass casting studios. Vestige would later be seen as a seminal and influential artwork in the field of contemporary art and glass. LaMonte's art addresses themes of beauty and loss; her works use a sartorial lens to explore the fragility of the human condition. LaMonte's sculptural work has received critical acclaim from art critics such as Arthur Danto. In his 2005 essay \\"The Poetry of Meaning and Loss: The Glass Dresses of Karen LaMonte\\", Danto wrote about Vestige: > The dress belonged to a moment when the wearer was, to use an expression of > Proust's, en fleur. The dress belonged to a certain moment of history, which > it preserves‚Äîit shows how women dressed for certain occasions at a certain > moment. The wearer will have aged. She looked like that then, but, if she is > still alive, it is certain she will not look that way now. There is a double > melancholy‚Äîthe melancholy of fashion, and the melancholy of bodily change, > from nubility to decrepitude. The breasts have fallen, the waist thickened, > the skin has lost it transparency and luminescence. The poignancy of > LaMonte's dresses is a product of two modes of change in which we > participate as human beings, composed, as we are, of flesh and meaning. > Their poetry is the poetry of beauty and loss. During LaMonte's 2006 fellowship to Japan, she explored how clothing serves as a societal language. Her research in Japan focused on the construction and meaning of the traditional kimono, hundreds of which she brought back to her Prague studio. LaMonte then used biometric data from Japanese women to build kimono forms in glass, bronze, rusted iron, and ceramic. Like her previous works, these full-sized kimono sculptures depict only garments and not their wearers. LaMonte entitled this series of sculptures Floating World, a name inspired by both Ukiyo-e woodblock prints and by the storied, arts-themed pleasure quarters of Edo-era Japan. LaMonte continued her examination of the female form with Nocturnes, a series of works informed by the night-themed paintings of James Abbot McNeill Whistler and by the nocturne musical compositions of John Field and Frederic Chopin. LaMonte built these sculptures from evening gowns of her own design, then cast them in white bronze, rusted iron, and blue glass. By focusing her work on the clothing and not the wearer, LaMonte says, ‚ÄúI subverted the tradition of the Odalisque‚Äîthe idealized recumbent female nude‚Äîby taking away the body.‚Äù In 2013, LaMonte spoke with the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art about her creative process and research techniques: > The research is definitely part of the appeal, but the thing that comes > first is the conceptualization: the idea for the sculptures. That‚Äôs one > layer of research, which I adore. And then usually it takes months and > months for the ideas to come together and a vision becomes clear. Then the > second phase is realization and that usually entails a bunch of material > research and material studies. Definitely if the ideas I‚Äôm working with push > me into a new material, I‚Äôm always thrilled at the challenges, because I do > love learning. And I think it‚Äôs very very healthy to access your creative > mind to solve technical problems as well. In 2017, LaMonte displayed her large-scale sculpture Cumulus at the Glasstress exhibition, in conjunction with the 2017 Venice Biennale. Unlike most of her previous works which focused on the absence of the human body, Cumulus depicts a cumulus cloud. She described her inspiration to Caltech Magazine: > What struck me was the fascinating and completely unexpected weight of > clouds. We see them floating in the air. We think of them as fluffy cotton > balls, like helium balloons. But when you learn a bit more, you realize > they're actually amazingly heavy. I thought, wouldn't it be amazing if we > could get a 'real' cloud and carve it in marble? LaMonte worked with Tapio Schneider, a climate scientist from the California Institute of Technology, to calculate and model the dimensions needed for Cumulus. She used robots to carve a 15-ton block of marble, and then spent four weeks hand-finishing the sculpture. Cumulus shares a common thread with LaMonte's previous garment-focused work. ‚ÄúMy cloud is baroque in its physicality,‚Äù she told Caltech Magazine. ‚ÄúIt looks like folds of fabric or flesh tumbling through space.‚Äù  Major works  Reclining Dress Impression with Drapery by Karen LaMonte. = Dress sculptures = LaMonte's first dress sculpture, Vestige (2000), is an influential work of cast glass. It was described by Habatat Galleries as a ‚Äúglass sculpture that changed the course of art history.‚Äù Vestige depicts a life-sized woman's dress, from which the wearer is absent. This sculpture and LaMonte's related works have received international acclaim for their uniqueness and beauty. Her Reclining Dress Impression with Drapery (2009) is part of the Smithsonian American Art Museum and Renwick Gallery‚Äôs permanent collection. The de Young Museum in San Francisco‚Äôs permanent collection contains Dress 3 (2001). = Floating World kimono sculptures = Sculptures from Karen LaMonte's Floating World series. LaMonte‚Äôs Floating World series evolved from her dress sculptures; these Japan-influenced works depict kimonos without their wearers. The sculptures are life-sized and created in iron, cast glass, bronze, and ceramic. Some works in the series also feature elements of kintsugi, a technique which uses gold to repair damaged or broken ceramic. LaMonte was inspired to create this series during her research fellowship in Kyoto, which was awarded by the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission. LaMonte writes about living ‚Äúin the traditional kimono-making district of Nishijin\\": > Even at night, my neighborhood hummed with the sounds of kimono production. > I studied all aspects of the craft, from weaving fabric to drawing imagery. > Fortunately, many people devoted to the preservation of traditional methods > took me under their wing. . . . In all cultures, clothing is an unspoken > language; but the Kimono is perhaps the most codified. Sculptures from LaMonte‚Äô Floating World are in the permanent collection of many museums including: Maiko (2010) at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Odoriko (2012, bronze), Kabuki (2012, ceramic), and Hanako (2012, cast glass) at the Chazen Museum of Art; and Chado (2010, cast glass) at the Knoxville Museum of Art. = Etudes = Etudes: one-third scale dress sculptures in white bronze, rusted iron, cast glass, and other materials by Karen LaMonte. LaMonte's Etudes are smaller than the life-sized dress sculptures that first gained her widespread recognition and are crafted from white bronze, rusted iron, cast glass, and other materials. She writes: > I began to develop my one-third-scale models into a stand-alone group of > sculptures that I called Etudes, a reference to my inspiration from the > field of music from composers such as Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. The Etudes are much > more than studies for larger works. They celebrate the power of human > optimism and our enduring need for beauty. LaMonte's Etudes sculptures are featured in the permanent collections of the Imagine Museum. = Nocturnes = LaMonte describes her Nocturnes series as ‚ÄúA new body of work inspired by the beauty of night . . . dark, seductive, and sublime. They are absent of female forms ‚Äì rising from penumbral garments as figurations of dusk. They build on the tradition of the female nude and probe the tension between humanism and eroticism, the physical and the ethereal, the body and the spirit. The figures are at once intensely physical ‚Äì muscles and flesh strain against clinging fabric ‚Äì and yet insubstantial: the figures are absent, implied only by the shapes pressing against the clothing.‚ÄùVisitors to the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Washington look at a Sartoriotype print by Karen LaMonte. The Nocturnes have been written about extensively, including a monograph published in 2019 with an essay by Dr. Steven Nash, who wrote: > Despite these associations with the past, LaMonte‚Äôs sculptures are very much > of our own time. They take their place in the resurgence of figurative art > following Minimalism‚Äôs banishment of the human figure in favor of elemental > abstract forms, and help underline the importance that sculpture has played > in that development. Many contemporary sculptors have adopted the human body > as an important vehicle for study of different aspects of the human > condition, including Kiki Smith, Jaume Plensa, Thomas Sch√ºtte, Huma Bhabha, > Juan Mu√±oz, and Georg Baselitz. LaMonte‚Äôs contributions in this arena > involve both her inventive treatment of materials and form and her > investigations of female identity and self-expression, which, as we have > seen, strike us in both sensuous and abstract ways. Each sculpture is an > individual construction of visual, haptic, and intellectual experience, > totally integrated. As the acclaimed British painter Cecily Brown has > opined, ‚ÄúPainting is very good at saying more than one thing at once.‚Äù > LaMonte‚Äôs Nocturnes affirm that sculpture is as well. Sculptures of the Nocturnes series are in the permanent collections of The Corning Museum, Knoxville Museum of Art, Iowa State University Museums, and Imagine Museum. = Sartoriotype prints = In addition to her sculpture work, LaMonte creates vivid, graphical, gray-scale monotype prints that depict clothing. ‚ÄúBlind to colour but hypersensitive to texture, the paper on which the monotypes are printed renders an almost X-ray-like image of the garment,‚Äù wrote Richard Drury in the Sculptures and Sartoriotypes monograph, ‚Äúa view through the layers of fabric - and through the tissue of time, to when the ripples and crumples we see in the prints were created by the active limbs of a unique human experience. It is an experience portrayed somehow fleetingly, an apparition of reanimated identity.‚Äù = Cumulus = alt= Cumulus cloudCumulus (2017) is LaMonte's first major work of Italian marble. She was drawn to the medium because she wanted ‚Äúto use a material forged by the forces of nature to represent the forces of nature.‚Äù The sculpture is eight feet tall and weighs two-and-a-half tons; it was modeled on climatological data from real-life weather and was carved with the help of robots and a super-computer. \\"Only by using technology could I make the diaphanous solid and the intangible permanent,\\" LaMonte told Caltech magazine. Cumulus was first displayed at the Venice Biennale at Glasstress, Palazzo Franchetti, Venice.

He was noted for his role during the Russo-Japanese War, especially during the Battle of Sandepu, in which he was awarded the Order of St. George afterwards.  Biography  Stackelberg was from a Baltic German noble family and graduated from the Nicholas General Staff Academy in 1869. His older brother Konstantin was a famous composer and the director of the Imperial Music Choir. (now the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra) As a commander in the 1st Semirechye Cossacks from 1874‚Äì1876, Stackelberg distinguished himself during the Russian conquest of the Khanate of Khiva and the Kokand expedition of 1875 under General Konstantin von Kaufman. He was wounded in combat, and although nominated for numerous awards, he refused to accept any. From August 18, 1886 to December 5, 1890 Stackelberg commanded the 25th Dragoon Regiment at Kazan. He was then assigned to command the Trans-Caspian Cossacks until December 3, 1897, followed by the 15th Cavalry Division to May 31, 1899. Stackelberg was commander of the Russian 10th Cavalry Division during the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China and Russian occupation of Manchuria. Afterwards, he was assigned command of the 2nd Siberian Army Corps from April 25, 1901 to February 11, 1902. He was then commander of the 1st Cavalry Corps from February 11, 1902 to February 3, 1904. From April 5, 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, Stackelberg was commander of the Russian 1st Siberian Army Corps, which played a major role in the Battle of Te-li-Ssu. Hampered by orders from Russian commander-in-chief General Aleksei Kuropatkin not to commit his entire reserves, and to fight a defensive battle rather than push forward in an offense, his forces were decisively defeated by the Second Japanese Army under General Oku Yasukata. In the subsequent Battle of Sandepu, Stackelberg chose to ignore Kuropatkin‚Äôs orders and made gains against entrenched Japanese positions, albeit with heavy casualties, but was forced to withdraw when reinforcements were denied. Relieved of his command for insubordination, he was sent back to St Petersburg after the battle,Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 358. where he was awarded the Order of St. George (4th class) for his actions.

He eventually reached the rank of lieutenant colonel and officer commanding 3/20 Burma Rifles. During the course of the war he was decorated with the Military Cross and later the Distinguished Service Order. Fourteen years later he made his first- class debut for Railways A against Freelooters. He was dismissed for a duck in the Railways first-innings by Ladha Ramji. In their second-innings he scored 12 runs, before being dismissed by Amar Singh. Burdett made a single stumping in the match, stumping Ahmed Baporia from the bowling of P. Ramsey-Brown. The following year he played his second and final first-class match, this time for Hyderabad against Karachi. In the Hyderabad first-innings, Burdett scored 37 runs before being dismissed by D.O.

It has several potential medicinal properties, like anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity.  Natural occurrences  Lupeol is found in a variety of plants, including mango, Acacia visco and Abronia villosa. It is also found in dandelion coffee. Lupeol is present as a major component in Camellia japonica leaf.  Total synthesis  The first total synthesis of lupeol was reported by Gilbert Stork et al. In 2009, Surendra and Corey reported a more efficient and enantioselective total synthesis of lupeol, starting from (1E,5E)-8-[(2S)-3,3-dimethyloxiran-2-yl]-2,6-dimethylocta-1,5-dienyl acetate by use of a polycyclization. 800px  Biosynthesis  Lupeol is produced by several organisms from squalene epoxide. Dammarane and baccharane skeletons are formed as intermediates. The reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme lupeol synthase. A recent study on the metabolomics of Camellia japonica leaf revealed that lupeol is produced from squalene epoxide where squalene play the role as a precursor.  Pharmacology  Lupeol has a complex pharmacology, displaying antiprotozoal, antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, antitumor and chemopreventive properties. Animal models suggest lupeol may act as an anti- inflammatory agent. A 1998 study found lupeol to decrease paw swelling in rats by 39%, compared to 35% for the standardized control compound indomethacin. One study has also found some activity as a Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor and prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitor at high concentrations (in the millimolar range). It is an effective inhibitor in laboratory models of prostate and skin cancers. As an anti-inflammatory agent, lupeol functions primarily on the interleukin system. Lupeol to decreases IL-4 (interleukin 4) production by T-helper type 2 cells. Lupeol has been found to have a contraceptive effect due to its inhibiting effect on the calcium channel of sperm (CatSper). Lupeol has also been shown to exert anti-angiogenic and anti-cancer effects via the downregulation of TNF-alpha and VEGFR-2.

Devil Dogs of the Air was the second of nine features that Pat O'Brien and James Cagney made together. The film's storyline was adapted from a novel by John Monk Saunders. Plot Lieut.

O'Toole arrives at San Diego and promptly starts to move in on Brannigan's love interest, Betty Roberts (Margaret Lindsay), the daughter of the owner of the nearby Happy Landings Cafe. In typical cocky fashion, O'Toole antagonizes nearly everyone else. Although not temperamentally suited for the military, Tommy completes primary training and after surviving an accident he caused by running out of fuel, eventually realizes that he is willing to change. Bill is assigned as his instructor, and on the first flight together, when Tommy begins to do some stunt flying, the aircraft has to be abandoned when it catches on fire. Bill bales out, but Tommy defies orders and lands the aircraft, making him a hero. Tommy performs his first solo flight perfectly and then browbeats Betty into attending the solo flight party with him. Bill is not amused. After a competition in the air with his friend Brannigan flying together, a midair emergency takes place, but it is Bill who saves the aircraft. Tommy makes a good landing, and finds Betty waiting for him. Although their friendship is restored, Bill realizes that Tommy has won Betty and arranges a transfer to another base.

Equipped with Vought O3U-6 Corsairs, the squadron continued to operate from San Diego and participated in the annual Fleet Problems, operating from the carriers , , and at different times. Shortly after receiving the F8C/OCs, the squadron, along with VO-10M took part in the filming of the 1929 movie Flight and later, prominently appeared in the Devil Dogs of the Air.

Because of their political value or former status, they were treated uncommonly well, and all but a few of them survived the war. Classification The Nazi regime classified its political prisoners into numerous categories, including *Erziehungsh√§ftlinge, \\"educational detainees\\"; *Vorbeugeh√§ftlinge, \\"preventative detainees\\"; *Protektoratsh√§ftlinge, \\"protectorate detainees\\"; as well as *Sonderh√§ftlinge and Ehrenh√§ftlinge, \\"special detainees\\" and \\"detainees of honor\\". The latter category also included the \\"personal prisoners of the F√ºhrer\\" ‚Äì opponents of the regime too prominent to be killed outright, as well as people like Hitler's failed assassin Georg Elser, who was initially kept alive with the intention of putting him on a show trial after the war. Prisons The SS- Reichssicherheitshauptamt, led by Heinrich Himmler, was responsible for the detention of the Sonder- und Ehrenh√§ftlinge. It built special detention centers for these prisoners in or near several concentration camps. Most of these facilities were much more comfortable than the camps' normal prisoner barracks. As the war wore on, the SS increasingly requisitioned a great number of hotels, castles, palaces and mansions and repurposed them as detention centers. These included: *Schloss Hirschberg near Weilheim, the guesthouse of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt. *Rheinhotel Dreesen in Bonn-Bad Godesberg after April 1944. *Hotel Ifen, a mountain hotel in the Kleinwalsertal, Austria. *Hotel Forelle, a luxury hotel in Tyrol, Austria. *Schloss Itter, a palace in Tyrol. Several other detention centers for high-level prisoners were planned. Albert Speer was charged to rebuild the Schwarzburg castle in the Schwarzatal, Thuringia, for this purpose, but the project was eventually abandoned. Inspired by the American prison of Alcatraz, SS officers searched the Baltic Sea coast for a suitable location of an island prison. In 1942, the SS decided to use the Pakri Islands near Baltischport (now Paldiski in Estonia) for this purpose, but the German defeat at Stalingrad put this position at risk and the project was also abandoned. Conditions The conditions under which the Sonder- und Ehrenh√§ftlinge were detained ranged from comfortable to luxurious, depending on their status. The prisoners did not have to work, were allowed to wear civilian clothing and ate the same food as their guards. After the war, Ernst Kaltenbrunner testified at the Nuremberg Trials that the prominent prisoners at places like Hotel Ifen or Bad Godesberg received \\"a triple diplomat's ration, that is to say, nine times the ration of a normal German during the war, as well as a bottle of Sekt each day.\\" Many detainees were allowed to receive visits by their family or to have their spouses live with them, and some of the highest-ranking prisoners, such as King Leopold III of Belgium, were allowed a small retinue of servants and followers. However, the prisoners normally had to pay for the cost of their detention. Kurt Schuschnigg, for instance, whose assets the Nazis had confiscated, was billed even for the cost of his relocation to Sachsenhausen. List of Sonder- und Ehrenh√§ftlinge The following is an incomplete list of notable Sonder- und Ehrenh√§ftlinge. Unless noted, the people listed here survived their detention. *L√©on Blum, the former French Prime Minister, held with his wife at Buchenwald concentration camp. *Yakov Dzhugashvili, the son of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, died at Sachsenhausen in 1943. *Georg Elser, a German man who had tried to assassinate Hitler. Detained at Sachsenhausen, he was shot on 9 April 1945. *Philippe P√©tain, the leader of Vichy France, was detained at Schloss Sigmaringen after September 1944, nominally as head of the French government- in-exile. *Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet, a French diplomat, detained at Hotel Ifen. *Genevi√®ve de Gaulle-Anthonioz, the niece of Charles de Gaulle, detained at Ravensbr√ºck. *Princess Mafalda of Savoy, the daughter of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, held at Buchenwald and killed in 1944 in an Allied air raid. *Mikl√≥s Horthy, Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary, arrested in 1944 for lack of cooperation with Nazi Germany and held at Schloss Hirschberg. *Leopold III, King of Belgium, detained first at the Royal Castle of Laeken, then at Hirschstein in Saxony from June 1944 to March 1945, and then at Strobl, Austria. *Benito Mussolini, the former Fascist leader of Italy, was briefly detained at Schloss Hirschberg after his rescue in the Gran Sasso raid, before being sent back to Italy to lead a German puppet state. *Martin Niem√∂ller, a noted German anti-Nazi theologian and Lutheran pastor, detained at Sachsenhausen and Dachau. *Francesco Saverio Nitti, the former Italian Prime Minister, detained at Hotel Ifen. *The family of Rupprecht von Bayern, Crown Prince of Bavaria. *Albert Sarraut, the former French Prime Minister, detained at Hotel Ifen. *Kurt Schuschnigg, the former Austrian chancellor, detained at Sachsenhausen with his wife and children, who joined him voluntarily. *Yaroslav Stetsko, member of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. Refused the German request to retract the proclamation of Ukrainian statehood of 30 June 1941 in Lviv, in which he had stated that the new Ukrainian state would \\"cooperate closely with Germany\\". But so as not to harm German-Ukrainian relations, agreed to be taken into custody. On 9 July he was taken to Berlin and released on 12 July, but was ordered to stay in Lviv.

Early years Guy Lagneau was born in 1915. He was a pupil and admirer of the architect Auguste Perret, whose later reconstruction of Le Havre (which was devastated during World War II) was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. He participated in setting up the Pavillon of Modern Times for the International Exposition of 1937. As a student at the √âcole des Beaux- Arts, in the Perret-Courtois studio, he designed a hotel at the edge of a lake, with a symmetrical but rhythmic structure of exposed reinforced concrete. This design was published in 1942 in a polemic article written by Michel Roux-Spitz, an opponent of traditionalist architecture. Lagneau played a very active role in the 3rd Perret studio in the 1942-1954 period, following the advice of Le Corbusier. Lagneau was among the architects who collaborated with Perret on the project to rebuild Le Havre, involved in the northern section. During the summer of 1945, he worked with Andr√© Le Donn√©, Andr√© Hermant and Jos√© Imbert to prepare the first draft of the new city plan, synthesizing the work of other architects, from which Perret developed the final plan submitted on 26 September 1945. 1950s Lagneau broke with the architectural principles of his master, Perret. He believed in light architecture, more like that of Le Corbusier. Through his work in Africa, he became deeply interested in the relationship between architecture and climate. In 1952 he founded the Atelier LWD, with Michel Weill and Jean Dimitrijevic, a partnership that was active from 1952 to 1987. Their first major project was the Hotel de France in Conakry, Guinea, designed in 1953 and completed in 1954. This was a long, seven-storied building, supported by pillars, with a restaurant located in a circular pavilion. The interior and furniture were designed by Charlotte Perriand and Jean Prouv√© in 1953. In March 1958, Lagneau unveiled the House of the Sahara, a home-made prototype made in collaboration with Weill, Dimitrijevic, Prouv√© and Perriand. In this work, they proposed a modern answer to the question of housing under extreme climatic conditions by applying the principle of separation. The house consisted of cabins cooled by air-conditioning in the day, but open at night onto the desert, all housed in a large tent that creates the central living space. This project was followed in 1958 by studies of tropical habitat in Guinea, resulting in a report which proposed concrete solutions for living in the humid tropics. Museum of Modern Art at Le Havre Lagneau was chosen by Georges Salles, director of National Museums, to undertake construction between 1952 and 1961 of the first major museum built in France after World War II, the Museum of Modern Art at Le Havre. Lagneau undertook the work in collaboration with Raymond Audigier, Michel Weill and Jean Dimitrejvic. The museum, inaugurated in 1961 by the Minister of Culture, Andr√© Malraux, was one of the key elements of the reconstruction of Le Havre. The museum departs from the tradition of closed museums cut off from the exterior world. Lagneau worked closely with the curator, Reynold Arnoult to develop a flexible space in harmony with the marine environment. Facing the sea, the museum is a smooth and transparent assembly of glass and steel posed on a concrete pad. Installed above the roof, the aluminum louver blades were created by the engineer Jean Prouv√©, providing control over the natural light that floods the building. Le Signal, a concrete sculpture by Henri Georges Adam, frames a fragment of the landscape and strongly emphasizes the exceptional situation of the building at the harbor entrance. Later years La D√©fense, Paris: the 1981 Quatre Temps shopping centre on a winter's afternoon Lagneau was asked by Jean Millier to review the urban plans for Abidjan, C√¥te d'Ivoire in 1960. Lagneau acted as an advisor to the Institute of Urban Planning and Development of the Paris Region, helping prepare master plans for creation of new towns between 1962 and 1965. In designing the seat of the new department of Essonne, he was influenced by what he had seen in the planned city of Brasilia. Thus he proposed a large body of water with the prefect's office in the center, flanked on each side by the courthouse and departmental Assembly. Inspired by the Japanese architect Kenzo Tange, who designed a city build on blocks to allow free movement on the ground and easy installation of equipment, Lagneau decided to place the administrative buildings on pillars. However, these plans were modified due to their cost. The buildings were arranged according to his plan, but were placed on the ground. Lagneau was unhappy but was forced to accept the decision. Lagneau, was architect of the Prefecture and the Palace of Justice of √âvry, Essonne with Michel Weill and Jean Dimitrijevic in 1975. In the late 1970s he designed the Quatre-Temps shopping center in La D√©fense, a business district of Paris, which opened in 1981. It was the biggest commercial centre in Europe at the time, and transformed the district. The Quatre-Temps reflects the values of lightness, sophistication and flexibility.

He was perhaps the most prolific publisher of new tachinids, naming and describing some 3000 species and genera.Hansen (2004) He made important contributions to the biological control of insect pests and he was the first to identify the insect vector of a debilitating disease in Peru.

In addition to teaching, he collected and studied local insects, especially those that had the potential to become agricultural pests. He made notes on 400 insect species in New Mexico and authored 90 publications.Laranaga In 1892 Townsend traded positions with a friend and fellow entomologist, T.D.A. Cockerell, and became curator of the Public Museum in Kingston, Jamaica. Townsend focused on educating the local farmers about insect pests and how to control them. In 1894 he was rehired by the USDA to study the appearance of a new pest, the cotton boll weevil in Texas and northern Mexico. He quickly determined the seriousness of the threat and made recommendations for controlling the outbreak. In 1896 the USDA sent him to tropical Mexico to continue his research on the boll weevil and search for predators or parasites that might provide biological control. He was unsuccessful in finding effective biological control agents but he did succeed in collecting a wide array of flies for his own studies. Upon his return from Mexico in 1899 he settled with his family in El Paso, Texas. Townsend and a partner started their own business, the Townsend-Barber Taxidermy and Zoological Company. Townsend acted as a field guide for the company, leading scientific and hunting expeditions into the Sierra Madre of northern Mexico. In 1903 he wrote an article for Field & Stream extolling the hunting opportunities in the region.Evenhuis (2013) After the death of his wife Caroline in 1903, Townsend left his children with relatives and taught biology for two years at the Batangas Provincial School in the Philippines. This appears to be the one time in his career that he did not actively collect flies or publish entomological papers. In 1906 he returned to the United States and was hired again at the USDA by L. O. Howard, the chief of the Bureau of Entomology. Townsend worked at a lab in Melrose Highlands, Massachusetts, studying potential parasites of the gypsy moth. While in Melrose Highlands, Townsend also remarried and completed his bachelor's degree from Columbia College. In 1909 Townsend was appointed Entomologist and Director of the Experiment Station in Piura, Peru.Mallis (1971) He was sent there to assess the insect pests that were damaging the country's cotton crops. He identified the cotton square-weevil as the major culprit and found an effective biological control for the pest. After this success he turned his attention to uncovering the vector for verruga peruana and Oroya fever, diseases endemic to the mountains of Peru that were responsible for thousands of deaths. Townsend eventually identified a sandfly, Lutzomyia verracarum, as the disease vector. Townsend returned to the U.S. in 1914 and was employed by the USDA as a specialist on parasitic flies and curator of the Diptera collection at the U.S. National Museum. He also completed his dissertation on the reproductive organs of the female fly and was awarded a doctorate degree by George Washington University. His success and recognition were cut short by a bitter controversy with his colleagues. Townsend was a notorious \\"splitter\\" of genera, describing hundreds of genera containing only a single species. Many entomologists disagreed with his approach to fly taxonomy and Townsend responded with scathing personal attacks against his critics. Finally, in 1919 when one of his critics, John M. Aldrich, was appointed chief of the Bureau of Entomology, Townsend decided to resign his position and leave the United States for good. Townsend and his family moved to Brazil, where he bought property in Itaquaquecetuba, including a large adobe house built in the 1600s by Jesuits. He was hired by the state government to investigate agricultural pests and recommend methods for control. In 1923 he returned to Peru and became director of the Institute of Agriculture and Parasitology in Lima. During this time he also traveled the breadth of South America following the Amazon River from the Atlantic to the Andes and then up and over the mountains to the Pacific Ocean. He wrote about his adventures in a series of travelogues published in by a travel magazine in Buenos Aires. He returned to Brazil in 1929 and took a job as an entomologist at Fordlandia, an industrial community established by Henry Ford to manage a huge rubber plantation and ensure a steady supply of rubber for the U.S. automobile industry. Townsend quit Fordlandia in 1935 but two of his sons continued to work there as entomologists for a number of years. Between 1934 and 1942 Townsend published his magnum opus on the muscoid flies, Manual of Myiology, consisting of 3760 pages in twelve parts with complete keys for the muscoid genera and extensive notes on biology and morphology. The last two volumes are an unexpected digression from entomology, containing his ideas on the origin of the moon, the development of humans, and the nature of gravity. Two years after completing the publication of his major work, Townsend died quietly at his home in Itaquaquecetuba on 17 March 1944. Despite his contributions and acknowledged expertise, Townsend remains a controversial figure, criticized for his approach to tachnid taxonomy. Entomologist James O'Hara has called him \\"the most eccentric and prolific of all tachinidologists\\" who \\"has, in some ways, done more to retard tachinid taxonomy than advance it.\\"O'Hara (2013) Notes References  Further reading * External links New Mexico State University 1863 births 1944 deaths American entomologists George Washington University Medical School alumni ","title":"Charles Henry Tyler Townsend"},{"id":"31239938","title":"Maxime Guyon"},{"id":"31239961","text":"The Menzies Government (1949‚Äì1966) refers to the second period of federal executive government of Australia led by Prime Minister Robert Menzies. It was made up of members of a Liberal-Country Party coalition in the Australian Parliament from 1949‚Äì1966. Menzies led the Liberal-Country Coalition to election victories in 1949, 1951, 1954, 1955, 1958, 1961 and 1963. Robert Menzies was Australia's longest serving Prime Minister. He had served a previous term as Prime Minister as leader of the United Australia Party from 1939‚Äì1941. Background =United Australia Party= The United Australia Party had been formed as a new conservative alliance in 1931, with Labor defector Joseph Lyons as its leader and John Latham, hitherto leader of the Nationalist Party of Australia as his deputy. The stance of Lyons and another former Labor minister, James Fenton, against the more radical proposals of the Labor movement to deal the Great Depression had attracted the support of prominent Australian conservatives. In March 1931, though still a member of the ALP, Lyons supported a no confidence motion against the Scullin Labor government and the UAP was formed from a coalition of citizens' groups and with the support of the Nationalist Party. In November 1931, Lang Labor dissidents chose to challenge the Scullin Labor government and align with the UAP to pass a 'no confidence' and the government fell. With Australia still suffering the effects of the Great Depression, the newly formed United Australia Party won a landslide victory at 19 December 1931 Election, and the UAP commenced its first term in government in January 1932. The Lyons Government won three consecutive elections, pursuing a conservative fiscal policy of balanced budgets and debt reduction, while stewarding Australia out of the Depression. Lyons death in April 1939 saw Robert Menzies assume the Prime Ministership on the eve of World War II. After a decade in office, the party had declined in popularity, and faced the demands of war in a shaky coalition with the Country Party. Forced to rely on the support of independents following the 1940 election, Menzies resigned in 1941, whereupon the UAP was unable to replace him with a suitable leader and allowed the leader of the junior coalition party, Arthur Fadden to take office. The Fadden Government lasted just 40 days, before the independents crossed the floor bringing Labor's John Curtin to the Prime Ministership just prior to the outbreak of the Pacific War. Labor's John Curtin proved a big war time leader and the Curtin Government won in a landslide in the 1943 election. In the aftermath of this defeat, the UAP began to disintegrate, and Australian conservatives and anti-socialist liberals looked to form a new political movement to counter the Australian Labor Party. =Foundation of Liberal Party= Sir Robert Menzies, Dame Enid Lyons (the first woman member of an Australian Cabinet), Sir Eric Harrison, Harold Holt (Menzies' successor) and an Airforceman in 1946. Fourteen political parties had allied to form the United Australia Party, but disenchantment with the United Australia Party was now widespread. A group of New South Wales members had formed the new \\"Democratic Party\\". This new group looked to Robert Menzies to provide leadership.Brian Carroll; From Barton to Fraser; Cassell Australia; 1978 Menzies called a conference of conservative parties and other groups opposed to the ruling Australian Labor Party which met in Canberra on 13 October 1944, and again in Albury in December 1944. The formation of the party was formally announced at Sydney Town Hall on 31 August 1945. Menzies had served as Prime Minister as leader of the United Australia Party from 1939‚Äì1941. From 1942 onward, Menzies had maintained his public profile with his series of \\"Forgotten People\\" radio talks, similar to US President Franklin D. Roosevelt's \\"fireside chats\\" of the 1930s, in which he spoke of the middle class as the \\"backbone of Australia\\" but as nevertheless having been \\"taken for granted\\" by political parties and of being effectively powerless because of lack of wealth on the one hand, and lack of organisation on the other. Outlining his vision for a new political movement in 1944, Menzies said: Menzies wanted the new party to be independent of interest groups like big business and so sought to organise a structure under which the Party would only receive money from individuals in small amounts, rather than from trade groups or associations. After only modest gains against Labor at the 1946 election, Menzies saw out another three years as opposition leader ‚Äì opposing Labor's efforts to nationalise Australia's banks, criticising petrol rationing and speaking out against Communism in the early stages of the Cold War. Menzies characterised the incumbent Chifley Government as \\"socialist\\". With Arthur Fadden of the Country Party as his deputy, Menzies led the Liberal- Country Party Coalition to victory at the 1949 election. He was now to become the longest serving prime minister in Australian history. Terms in office Fifth Menzies Ministry in 1951. Following victory in the 1949 election, the Menzies Government secured a double dissolution election for 28 April 1951, after the Australian Labor Party-controlled Senate refused to pass the Menzies' banking legislation. The Liberal-Country Coalition was returned with a reduced majority in the Lower House, but with control of the Senate. The Government was returned in the aftermath of the Petrov affair in the 1954 election and again after the formation of the anti-Communist Democratic Labor Party split the Australian Labor Party early in 1955 and Australia went to the polls in December 1955. John McEwen replaced Arthur Fadden as leader of the Country Party in March 1958 and the Menzies-McEwen Coalition was returned again at elections in November 1958 ‚Äì their third victory against Labor's H V Evatt. The Coalition was narrowly returned against Labor's Arthur Calwell in the December 1961 election, in the midst of a credit squeeze. Menzies stood for office for the last time in the November 1963 election, again defeating Calwell, with the Coalition winning back its losses in the House of Representatives. Menzies went on to resign from parliament on 26 January 1966. Menzies' 1949 Cabinet had the leader of the Country Party, Arthur Fadden, as the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister and included Dame Enid Lyons as the first woman to serve in an Australian Cabinet.http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A140134b.htm =Economy and trade= After winning office in 1949, Menzies fulfilled his promises to end rationing of butter, tea and petrol and provide a 5 shilling endowment for first born children, as well as for others. Australia experienced a prolonged economic boom during the Menzies years. Menzies remained a staunch supporter of links to the monarchy and British Commonwealth but formalised an alliance with the United States and launched post-war trade with Japan, beginning a growth of Australian exports of coal, iron ore and mineral resources that would steadily climb until Japan became Australia's largest trading partner. John McEwen, as minister for commerce and for trade negotiated the Agreement on Commerce between Australia and Japan which was signed in July 1957. The agreement carried political risk for the Menzies government, because memories of atrocities perpetrated on Australians by Japan in World War II were still strong in the community. Britain meanwhile was negotiating entry into the European Economic Community in the early 1960s with major implications for Australian trade, which had previously enjoyed preferential treatment in the UK. McEwen was active in maintaining tariff protections for agriculture, mining and manufacturing, which he believed would sustain employment and contribute to national defence.http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150245b.htm?hilite=john%3Bgorton In the Menzies Government, McEwen pursued what became known as \\"McEwenism\\" ‚Äì a policy of high tariff protection for the manufacturing industry, so that industry would not challenge the continuing high tariffs on imported raw materials, which benefitted farmers but pushed up industry's costs. This policy was a part (some argue the foundation) of what became known as the \\"Australian settlement\\" which promoted high wages, industrial development, government intervention in industry (Australian governments traditionally owned banks and insurance companies and the railways and through policies designed to assist particular industries) and decentralisation. In the early 1950s, external affairs minister Percy Spender helped to establish the Colombo Plan for providing economic aid to underdeveloped nations in Australia's region. Under the scheme, many future Asian leaders studied in Australia. In 1951, the top marginal tax rate for incomes above ¬£10,000 what is equivalent to $425,000 today, was 75 per cent under Menzies. from 1955 until the mid-1980s the top marginal tax rate was 67 per cent.https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/opinion/hit-the-very-wealthy- with-more-tax-as-robert-menzies-did/news- story/8953321ef14d6074db39803d3a722776 Other than blocking the nationalisation of the Banking system by the Labor Party, Menzies privatised the Commonwealth Oil Refinery. The wool industry remained a mainstay of the economy through the 1950s, indeed it was said that the Australian economy \\"rode on the sheep's back\\".http://dl.nfsa.gov.au/module/1592/ Nevertheless, important developments in further industries occurred, such as the construction of Australia's first commercial oil field at Moonie in Queensland in 1961.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/timeline/results.aspx In 1960, the government split the Commonwealth Bank of Australia into the Commonwealth Banking Corporation and the Reserve Bank of Australia. While for most Australians the Menzies era was an era of prosperity, the nation experienced high inflation during the early years of Menzies' rule. The Korean War increased demand for commodities. Wool in particular boomed, leading to a rise in growers' incomes, but also to inflation. The Arbitration Court helped stabilise wages from 1953. From 1959‚Äì1960 Australia experienced something of a boom, spurred by overseas speculators and high domestic spending ‚Äì resulting in recession by 1961, following a \\"horror\\" mini-budget designed to slow the economy. Unemployment reaching 2.1% (at that time considered \\"high\\") and Menzies went on to win the 1961 election by just one seat. Following the election, Menzies and Treasurer Harold Holt introduced another mini-budget designed to spur growth and the economy was in recovery. =Foreign affairs= The Menzies era saw immense regional changes, with post-war reconstruction and the withdrawal of European Powers and the British Empire from the Far East (including independence for India and Indonesia); the consolidation of Communist regimes in China, North Vietnam, North Korea and Communist insurgencies elsewhere. Cold War Cold War politics: Evdokia Petrova at Sydney Airport, being escorted to a waiting plane by two armed KGB agents during the Petrov Affair. Menzies intervened to prevent her forced removal to the USSR following the defection of her husband. Menzies was firmly anti- Communist. In 1950 his government committed troops to the Korean War and attempted to ban the Communist Party of Australia. Menzies secured passage of the Communist Party Dissolution Bill through Parliament in June 1950. Although it had popular support, for many it went too far in such measures as allowing the disqualifying of declared Communists from public offices, or industries considered vital to defence. The Bill had the support of anti-Communist Labor Senators, and so passed through Parliament. Early in 1951 however, the High Court declared the Act invalid for unconstitutionally interfering with civil liberties and property rights. Following the 1951 election, Menzies held a referendum seeking power for the Federal Parliament to legislate \\"With respect to Communists or Communism as the Parliament considers to be necessary or expedient for the defence or security of the Commonwealth\\". Labor leader H V Evatt campaigned against the proposal and the referendum was narrowly defeated. In 1951, during the early stages of the Cold War, Menzies spoke of the possibility of a looming third world war. Soviet diplomat Vladimir Petrov and his wife defected from the Soviet embassy in Canberra in 1954, revealing evidence of Russian spying activities and Menzies called a Royal Commission.http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150416b.htm?hilite=robert%3Bmenzies The Labor Party split over concerns about the influence of the Communist Party over the Trade Union movement, leading to the foundation of the breakaway Democratic Labor Party(DLP) whose preferences supported the Liberal and Country Party, in return for key concessions, like funding for Catholic schools. The new Party never won a House of Representatives seat, but often held the balance of power in the Senate.http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/04/30/2886680.htm?site=thedrum Treaties and defence Sir Percy Spender negotiated the ANZUS Treaty alliance with the United States and Colombo Plan for aid and development assistance for Asia. Australia signed the official Peace Treaty with Japan in San Francisco in 1951, but by this point, the world had entered a new and tense period in international relations ‚Äì the Cold War. With the memory of Japanese expansionism fresh in the Australian experience, and with the commencement of the Cold War seeing the Soviet Union dominating Eastern Europe, the Chinese Communist Party winning the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and Communist North Korea invading South Korea in 1950, Australia sought security outside its traditional allegiance to Britain. In June 1950, Communist North Korea invaded South Korea. The Menzies government responded to a United States led United Nations Security Council request for military aid for South Korea and diverted forces from occupied Japan to begin Australia's involvement in the Korean War. The entry of Communist China into the war saw allied forces driven backwards down the peninsula. After fighting to a bitter standstill, the UN and North Korea signed a ceasefire agreement in July 1953. Australian forces had participated in such major battles as Kapyong and Maryang San. 17,000 Australians had served and casualties amounted to more than 1,500, of whom 339 were killed.http://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/korea.asp Analysts voiced fear of the \\"domino theory\\", according to which South East Asia would fall to Communism state by state. In defence policy, Menzies moved Australia to a policy of \\"forward defence\\" and committed troops against Communists insurgencies in South East Asia ‚Äì the Malayan Emergency, and Indonesia's policy of Confrontation and, near the end of Menzies' prime ministership, the early stages of the Vietnam War. In 1951, the first call ups were made under the National Service Act, which provided for compulsory military training of 18-year-old men, who were then to remain on the Army Reserve for five years. The Scheme trained 227,000 men between 1951 and 1960 (when it ended). In 1952, a program of British nuclear weapons testing began in Australia. The program was based at Maralinga, South Australia from 1954 until 1963 (and was later the subject of a Royal Commission investigation). National Service was reintroduced in 1964, in the form of the National Service Lottery, under which Marbles of birth dates were drawn from a lottery barrel. The Scheme remained in place until 1972 and saw 63,000 men conscripted. The Menzies Government entered the first formal military alliance outside of the British Commonwealth with the signing of the ANZUS Treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United States in San Francisco in 1951. External Affairs Minister Percy Spender had put forward the proposal to work along similar lines to the NATO Alliance. The Treaty declared that any attack on one of the three parties in the Pacific area would be viewed as a threat to each, and that the common danger would be met in accordance with each nation's constitutional processes. In 1954, the Menzies Government signed the South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty (SEATO) as a South East Asian counterpart to NATO. In 1959, Australia signed the Antarctic Treaty agreeing a legal framework for the management of Antarctica.aspx Suez Crisis Robert Menzies' was despatched to Cairo by an 18 nation committee to act as chairman in negotiations with Egyptian President Nasser following his 1956 nationalisation of the Suez Canal during the Suez Crisis. Western powers had built the trade canal, but Egypt was now seeking to exclude them from a role in its ownership or management. Menzies felt that Nasser's actions threatened Australia's interests as a trading nation and an ally of Britain.R. G. Menzies; Speech is of Time; Cassell; London; 1958 Menzies' 7 September official communique to Nasser presented a case for compensation for the Suez Canal Company and the \\"establishment of principles\\" for the future use of the Canal that would ensure that it would \\"continue to be an international waterway operated free of politics or national discrimination, and with financial structure so secure and an international confidence so high that an expanding and improving future for the Canal could be guaranteed\\" and called for a Convention to recognise Egyptian sovereignty of the Canal, but for the establishment of an international body to run the canal. Nasser saw such measures as a \\"derogation from Egyptian sovereignty\\" and rejected Menzies' proposals. Menzies hinted to Nasser that Britain and France might use force to resolve the crisis, but United States President Eisenhower openly opposed the use of force and Menzies left Egypt without success. Menzies voiced support for the subsequent Anglo- French military operation in Egypt, which resulted in a humiliating withdrawal and the resignation of the British Prime Minister, Anthony Eden. =Commonwealth of Nations= Queen Elizabeth II with Menzies at an official function during her first visit to Australia in 1954. Popular support for the Monarchy in Australia was high during the Menzies era. The Menzies era saw the sun set on the British Empire and the expansion of the Commonwealth of Nations as its successor. Menzies and Australians in general remained deeply loyal to the institution of the Monarchy in Australia and the 1954 Royal Tour by Queen Elizabeth II and her consort, Prince Philip was greeted by wild enthusiasm across the continent. Harold Macmillan then became the first British Prime Minister to visit in 1958. The first tour by a reigning monarch saw her cover 10,000 miles by air and 2,000 miles by ground. On a later Royal Tour in 1963, Menzies famously and effusively praised Queen Elizabeth by quoting an Elizabethan era poem: \\"I did but see her passing by and yet I love her till I die\\". As decolonisation proceeded around the British Empire, the Menzies Government followed Britain's lead and imposed economic sanctions on Southern Rhodesia when the Ian Smith government had declared self-government to maintain white minority rule. =Society and welfare= The Menzies Government instigated a series of important reforms to immigration laws, which resulted in the erosion of the restrictions of the unofficial White Australia Policy which had privileged British migrants over all others since the time of Australian Federation in 1901 and abolished restrictions on voting rights for Aboriginal people, which had persisted in some jurisdictions. Health In 1953 the government introduced a number of reforms to the existing provision of health services. These reforms served as the basis for the future expansion in the provision of public health and aged care services. The first major health reform was the creation of a voluntary, contributory national health scheme through the National Health Act,1953. This was followed by the Aged Persons Homes Act, 1954, the Aged and Disabled Persons Care Act, 1954 and the Home Nursing Subsidy Act, 1956. National subsidies for residential aged care services commenced in 1963. In implementing these reforms the Menzies Government promoted the role of private insurance funds and private health care providers (mainly charitable and religious based organisations), rather than adopting the model adopted in the United Kingdom with the introduction of the National Health Service in the 1940s. In 1960, the Menzies Government introduced a new pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which expanded the range of prescribed medicines subsidised by the government. Marriage and divorce Through the Matrimonial Causes Act 1959, the Menzies Government introduced a uniform divorce law across Australia and recognised \\"no-fault\\" divorce by allowing a specified period of separation as sufficient grounds for a divorce. It was eventually replaced by the Family Law Act 1975. In 1961, the Menzies Government used the powers granted by section 51(xxi) of the constitution to pass the Marriage Act 1961, which gave the federal government exclusive jurisdiction over the formation of marriages. It remains in force although it has been amended on several occasions. Immigration Beginning in 1949, Immigration Minister Harold Holt decided to allow 800 non- European war refugees to remain in Australia, and Japanese war brides to be admitted to Australia. In 1950 External Affairs Minister Percy Spender instigated the Colombo Plan, under which students from Asian countries were admitted to study at Australian universities, then in 1957 non-Europeans with 15 years' residence in Australia were allowed to become citizens. In a watershed legal reform, a 1958 revision of the Migration Act introduced a simpler system for entry and abolished the \\"dictation test\\" which had permitted the exclusion of migrants on the basis of their ability to take down a dictation offered in any European language. Immigration Minister, Sir Alexander Downer, announced that 'distinguished and highly qualified Asians' might immigrate. Restrictions continued to be relaxed through the 1960s in the lead up to the Holt Government's watershed Migration Act, 1966. This was despite in a discussion with radio 2UE's Stewart Lamb in 1955 he was a defender of the White Australia Policy:https://www.sbs.com.au/news/what- menzies-really-thought-of-the-commonwealth > (Menzies) \\"I don't want to see reproduced in Australia the kind of problem > they have in South Africa or in America or increasingly in Great Britain. I > think it's been a very good policy and it's been of great value to us and > most of the criticism of it that I've ever heard doesn't come from these > oriental countries it comes from wandering Australians. (Lamb) \\"For these > years of course in the past Sir Robert you have been described as a racist.\\" > (Menzies) \\"Have I?\\" (Lamb) \\"I have read this, yes.\\" (Menzies) \\"Well if I > were not described as a racist I'd be the only public man who hasn't been.\\" Aboriginal affairs Campaigns for Aboriginal rights gathered pace in Australia during the Menzies era. When Menzies assumed office, Aborigines were still excluded from voting in Federal elections in Queensland and West Australia. In 1949, Parliament legislated to ensure that all Aboriginal ex- servicemen should have the right to vote. In 1961 a Parliamentary Committee was established to investigate and report to the Parliament on Aboriginal voting rights and in 1962, Menzies' Commonwealth Electoral Act provided that all Indigenous Australians should have the right to enrol and vote at federal elections.http://aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htmhttp://aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/history.htm In 1963, Yolngu people petitioned Parliament, with the famous Yirrkala bark petitions, after the government excised land from the Arnhem Land reserve, without consulting the traditional owners. Echoing developments in the United States and elsewhere in the Western World and their disintegrating colonial empires, attitudes to race underwent significant shifts in Australia during the Menzies era. Aboriginal artists like Albert Namatjira could gain great popularity and be presented to the Queen on her first Royal Tour, but under existing law still needed to be \\"granted\\" Australian citizenship. Indigenous activists like Douglas Nicholls and Faith Bandler continued their long campaign of lobbying governments for legal reform and University of Sydney students led by Charles N. Perkins sought to expose inequalities with their freedom rides in the mid-60s. Menzies' successor Harold Holt instigated the famous 1967 Referendum, which saw a 90% endorsement from the electorate to automatically include Aboriginal peoples in the national census. =Education, science and infrastructure= The Menzies Government extended Federal involvement in education and developed the city of Canberra as the national capital. Menzies introduced the Commonwealth scholarship scheme in 1951, to cover fees and pay a generous means-tested allowance for bright students from lower socioeconomic groups. In 1956, a committee headed by Sir Keith Murray was established to inquire into the financial plight of Australia's universities, and Menzies' pumped funds into the sector under conditions which preserved the autonomy of universities. In 1954, the government established Mawson Station in Antarctica as Australia's first permanent base on the continent and in 1957, Davis Station was constructed. In 1956, Television in Australia began broadcasting. In a significant step, Menzies opted for a hybrid system, licensing both commercial and public broadcasters.http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/4.2/Curthoys.html The Australian Atomic Energy Commission (now Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation) was set up under the Atomic Energy Act in 1953 and Lucas Heights Nuclear Reactor commenced operation in 1958. From 1960 the Government allowed the United States to establish satellite tracking stations in the A.C.T. ‚Äì resulting in the construction of Orroral Creek, Honeysuckle Creek and Tidbinbilla. The National Astronomical Observatory, a 64-metre radio telescope at Parkes was opened in 1961. These facilities would prove crucial to the United States Lunar Program. Australia joined the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium in 1964. In 1960, money was set aside for the construction of the long-delayed Lake Burley Griffin ‚Äì the original centre-piece of the design for Canberra. In 1962, an interstate coaxial cable linking the Eastern seaboard cities was completed. International direct dial was achieved with the opening of the Commonwealth Pacific Cable in 1963, in a scheme designed to link the Commonwealth by phone. =Menzies era= In his last address to the Liberal Party Federal Council in 1964, Menzies reflected on the \\"Liberal Creed\\" as follows: Though often characterised as a \\"conservative\\" period in Australian history, the Menzies era was a period of sustained economic boom with rapid technological advance and Australia experienced the beginnings of sweeping social change ‚Äì with the arrivals of rock and roll music and television in the 1950s. Melbourne hosted the Olympics and iconic Australian performers like Barry Humphries, Johnny O'Keefe and Slim Dusty emerged in the arts scene during the 1950s. Though support for the monarchy in Australia remained strong, Australia's cultural and political identity began a slow shift away from its traditional British allegiance. Retirement of Menzies Menzies was Knighted in 1963, and was honoured in 1965 by being appointed to succeed Winston Churchill as Constable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/menzies/index.aspx Menzies' second period as prime minister lasted a record sixteen years and seven consecutive election victories and ended in his voluntary retirement on 26 January 1966, aged 71. Harold Holt replaced the retiring Menzies in 1966 and the Holt Government went on to win 82 seats to Labor's 41 in the 1966 Election.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/holt/elections.aspx See also *History of Australia *History of Australia since 1945 *Fourth Menzies Ministry *Fifth Menzies Ministry *Sixth Menzies Ministry *Seventh Menzies Ministry *Eighth Menzies Ministry *Ninth Menzies Ministry *Tenth Menzies Ministry References Liberal Party of Australia National Party of Australia History of Australia since 1945 1949 establishments in Australia 1966 disestablishments in Australia Robert Menzies ","title":"Menzies Government (1949‚Äì66)"},{"id":"31239969","title":"Filippo Timi"},{"id":"31239970","text":"Mountain bicycle equipped with Kenda tires Kenda Rubber Industrial Company () is a manufacturer of pneumatic tires in Taiwan since 1962 with manufacturing facilities in Taiwan, Mainland China, Vietnam, and Indonesia.

It first appeared in magazine form in the January 1976 and February 1976 issues of Galaxy Science Fiction and was first published in book form by Dell Publishing in July 1977. Plot The story takes the form of an audio diary kept by the unnamed protagonist. A group of people, with no technical skills and scant supplies, are stranded on a planet and debate how to survive. The men in the group are dedicated to colonizing and populating the planet, but the unnamed female protagonist, who does not believe that long-term survival is possible, resists being made pregnant by them. Tensions escalate into violence, until finally she is forced to kill the other survivors in order to defend herself against rape. Left alone, she becomes increasingly philosophical, recounting her personal history in political agitation and attempting to chart the days and seasons even as she begins to hallucinate from hunger and loneliness. She experiences visions, first of the people she killed, and then of people from her past. Finally, weak from hunger, she resolves to kill herself. Reception We Who Are About To... received poor reviews at the time of publication, and was panned by Spider Robinson writing in Analog, and by Algis Budrys in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction.

The new IMM plant will assemble up to 25,000 units a year. In Kairouan, the IMM is manufacturing up to 4,000 units a year. The vehicles will be marketed alongside the two local markets in Gibraltar, Morocco, Mauritania and Libya. The IMM is responsible for the supply of the markets of the Maghreb region and the Arab Maghreb Union. Special attention was given to the vehicles of the IMM in the 2011 Libyan civil war when Gaddafi's henchmen used them to attack their own cities to spread fear and terror. Currently the IMM is the only Tunisian car manufacturer besides Wallyscar. However, in Algeria SOVAC (VW), Elsecom Motors (Ford) and the RPA (Renault) are serious competitors.

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) considers prohibiting technologies if they are \\"performance-enhancing\\" or \\"being against the spirit of the sport\\". In 2006, WADA initiated a consultation on technology doping which is now officially recognised as a threat, whilst the decision to allow or ban a new technology, specifically relating to sports equipment, is the responsibility of each sport‚Äôs own governing body.  Grey area  Since most sports require equipment of some sort, it can be tricky to determine what is technology doping and what is not. The governing authorities of different sports usually make judgment calls about the technological advances in their sport‚Äôs equipment. Technological advancements are often allowed unless the governing authorities feel they threaten the integrity of the sport. A report released immediately before the 2012 Summer Olympics quotes an extensive public survey that shows that people fear that sports engineering could: overshadow the triumph of human spirit and effort, make certain sports easier, create unfairness so the \\"best athletes\\" might not win, and ensure that rich athletes and countries have an advantage over the poor ones. Examples  = LZR racer swimsuit = The LZR Racer has been one of the most discussed technologies accused of being technology doping. The LZR Racer bodysuit by Speedo is a high-performance swimsuit. It is made with a material that was designed to mimic shark skin. The suit allows for better oxygen flow to the muscles, holds the body in a more hydrodynamic position, and traps air which adds buoyancy. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, this suit was worn by many swimmers. In fact, some swimmers wore two or more of these suits at once to increase buoyancy. In total, 23 out of the 25 swimming world records broken at the Beijing Olympics were broken by swimmers wearing this suit. Some people thought these suits might be so technologically advanced that using them in competition was essentially technology doping. After the Beijing Olympics and subsequent swimming events, at which many world records were broken by swimmers wearing the LZR suit, FINA (F√©d√©ration Internationale de Natation) banned all body-length swimsuits. Men's suits could only maximally cover from the waist to the knee. Women's suits could only cover from shoulder to knee. They also stipulated that the fabric used to make the suits must be a ‚Äútextile‚Äù and the suit could not have fastening devices, such as zippers. These new rules took effect in January 2010. = Ionized shirts = A New Zealand firm has created ‚ÄúIonX shirts‚Äù which are made of a material that claims to contain a negatively charged electromagnetic field. It further claims that the shirt helps increase blood flow, which in turn helps deliver more oxygen to the muscles and remove lactic acid from the muscles more quickly. For the moment, this technology is still legal. The World Anti-Doping Agency has ruled that since there is no scientific publication that confirms the material actually changes the body‚Äôs ion charges or enhances performance and also the material does not contain prohibited substances, this technology is not banned as of now. = Interactive materials = Researchers at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, an Australian science agency, created a garment that can monitor movement and give feedback. For example, a basketball player can wear the material in the form of a sleeve. Then sensors in the material send information to a computer when the player takes shots and responds with audible tones. The material essentially gives the athlete real-time feedback on their movements. Athletes can learn patterns of tones that indicate successful or unsuccessful movements and use these to make improvements. The material helps correct the athlete‚Äôs movement and helps the athlete gain muscle memory so they can continue to perform well once the material is taken away. = Mechanical doping = In cycling, mechanical doping is the use of a secret motor to propel the bicycle. It is banned by the Union Cycliste Internationale. One of the first allegations of mechanical doping was in the 2010 Tour of Flanders. The first confirmed use of mechanical doping was at the 2016 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships. Bike inspections have become commonplace in road racing since the 2015 season. Riders found guilty of mechanical doping are subject to a fine ranging from 20,000 to 200,000 Swiss Francs and a suspension of at least six months. In the 2016 Tour de France, French officials utilized thermal cameras to enforce their policy against mechanical doping. = Artificial limbs = Amputees can compete in the Paralympic Games using artificial limbs. There has been significant debate on whether the artificial limbs confer an advantage over able-bodied athletes and whether athletes using them can participate in the Olympic Games. There has also been debate on the effect of the length of the artificial limbs in the Paralympic Games. = Telemetry hacking = Prior to the Women's World Gliding Championship at Lake Keepit 2020, the competition organisers mandated the use of a real time tracking system to make the sport more appealing to the general public. To maintain the challenge of the race the positions of each competitor was delayed by 15 minutes. After a few days of competing the near-telepathic ability of the Australian pilots to predict the movements of their opponents lead to questions being asked and on the penultimate day of the contest the Australian team captain Terry Cubley (EO of the GFA , admitted hacking (whilst denying cheating) the live tracking, bypassing the 15 minute delay and radioing the real time position of the competing teams to the Australian pilots, giving them a substantial tactical advantage. https://wwgc2019.com/wp- content/uploads/files/downloads/Annex%20SC3a%20Rules.pdf https://glidingaustralia.orghttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/F√©d√©ration_A√©ronautique_Internationalehttp://soaring.eu  Standardized equipment  Many sports set standards for equipment, to prevent unfair advantages between competitors. This often involves the types of materials the equipment is made from or dimensions/sizes. For example, tennis racquets must not exceed the maximum length and width limits. Soccer balls must not exceed weight limits. Golf clubs must fit shape regulations.

The prototype was modified into the Beagle B.242X but neither variant entered production. Design and development Before it became part of Beagle, Miles Aircraft had looked at producing replacements for the (single-engined) Miles Messenger and (twin- engined) Gemini. Three low-wing monoplane designs were considered, the single- engined fixed landing gear Miles 114 in two and four-seat versions and the retractable landing gear twin-engined four-seat Miles 115. When Beagle was formed it was decided to build a prototype of the Miles 115 design designated the Beagle-Miles M.218X; it was also decided to build a prototype of the Miles 114 as the M.117 but in the end it was not built. The M.218 was of plastic and metal construction; the wing spar box and the rear lower fuselage were made from aluminium alloy which formed a T-shaped load bearing structure which carried the metal tailplane and all the plastic components. It was powered by two Rolls Royce Continental O-300 piston engines and had a retractable tricycle landing gear. Construction started at the end of 1961 and it made its first flight at Shoreham on 19 August 1962. Registered G-ASCK it was displayed at the 1962 Farnborough Air Show priced at ¬£9,800, it did create interest from customers although they had a preference for metal built aircraft rather than the plastic M.218. The production aircraft were to be named Martlet but the company did not have the money to put it into production due to the overspend on the Beagle B.206. In May 1963, George Miles left Beagle and the M.218 designation was changed to B.218. The prototype was grounded in February 1964 for extensive modification. The majority of the glass fibre components were replaced in light alloy, which incorporated the original T-frame structure, with more powerful IO-360 engines fitted. Now re-registered G-ASTX and designated as the Beagle B.242X, it flew again on 27 August 1964. The aircraft was issued with a certificate of airworthiness on 18 June 1965 but the company was focussed on the production of the twin-engined Beagle B.206 and the design of the single-engined Beagle Pup and could not afford to further develop the type or put it into production, although a second airframe was commenced. The prototype was withdrawn from use in 1966 and subsequently destroyed in a building fire in August 1969. The Beagle M.218 was unsuccessful as it became a political football in the internal strife between the former Miles Aircraft directors and the Beagle board; although it was attractive to Beagle distributors, it was seen as a competitor to the Beagle 206. Over ¬£300,000 was spent on the project for which Beagle had neither a cohesive plan nor the necessary resources to produce.

One player can sometimes play two salamuris at once by using either hand. The salamuri is a widespread wind musical instrument found in all regions of Georgia (especially in Kartli, Kakheti, Meskheti, Tusheti, Pshavi, and Imereti). Relics obtained from archaeological excavations prove the existence of the salamuri in Georgia during ancient times. Among the relics found by an archaeological expedition in Mtskheta (Eastern part of Georgia), an interesting aspect of Georgian musical culture attracts attention. This is a bone pipe, found in 1938 at the northern section of Samtavro's sepulchre. This salamuri is made of swan (shin) bone. It is unreeded and has only three small keys on the front side. The surface of the instrument is well polished. Its length is 19,9 cm. The size of blowing part is 1,1 cm and the bottom's part is 1,8 cm. It was found along with the remains of a 14-15-year-old boy in a grave. Many other things were also put there: earthenware, crockery, arms, clothes, a talisman and so on. It is worthy of note that there were sheep bones, a bull's head and feet bones there as well. On account of this the guide of the expedition the academician Iv. Djavakhishvili called it ‚ÄúThe grave of a little shepherd‚Äù. The examination of sepulchre dated it back to the 12th-11th century B.C., and if taken into consideration the instrument's well developed design, it should have been widely spread in Georgia a long time before then. Bone-pipes (salamuris) were also found in the monastery at Uplistsikhe. In 1930 a bone salamuri (flute) was found together with other things in ancient burials of Samtavro in Mtskheta. Supposedly it dates back to the 15th-13th centuries B.C. Currently this salamuri is kept in the \\"Simon Janashia Museum of Georgia\\". Researchers once tried to make sound from it and have issued only four sounds. What they considered to be sufficient for their archaeological researches also have counted sufficient. It was understandable as no one expected anything greater. It is necessary to note, that the researchers did not pay adequate attention to these four sounds. This instrument has an absolutely perfected and correct tetra chord that outstrips by thousands of years Greek tetra chord formation. But this salamuri keeps much more secrets in itself; it appears that it is possible to issue 10 sounds from it, not by over-blowing, but by inclining the instrument in different angles. In Georgia, there are two kinds of salamuris preserved till the present day: reeded and unreeded salamuri. These two kinds of salamuri differ in their timber, form, sound range and resonance. The unreeded salamuri represents a pipe of approx. 380-400mm in length. It has 8 front keys and sometimes one key on the back side. The first front key is placed 13 cm. apart from the head, but the other 6 front keys are separated by equal distance (3 cm). It is often made from cane, apricot-tree, reed and elder. It becomes slightly narrower towards the end, to blow in comfortably. The unreeded salamuri has a diatonic scale of one octave. By overblowing, its compass increases. The unreeded salamuri is mainly used in parts of east Georgia (Kakheti, Kartli, Meskheti, Tusheti and Pshavi). But the reeded salamuri represents a wooden pipe of 23‚Äì36 cm. in length with a cut-off head. As usual, it has 8 front keys and one back key (between front first and second keys). The reed of salamuri is a small tap (1,2-1,5 cm) inside the pipe. Reeded salamuri is more often made out of walnut and apricot trees. Despite the fact that the reeded salamuri is smaller than the unreeded one, its technical abilities are considerably higher (richer sounding and larger sound range). It is more difficult to design the reeded salamuri and requires master's experienced hand. The salamuri has a diatonic scale of one octave. By overblowing, its compass increases. The wood material for salamuri should be proportionally grown up, straight, carefully cut down and drilled from the beginning to the end. The hollow and surface should be well polished. Then they would cut the pipe's head and attach the instrument's reed to this place. On the surface, the area of reed is a bit cut off. Only from this air way the air should be emitted, that is why the blowing part (neck) is entirely closed. Then they cut 8 oval front keys along the instrument's reed. They should be separated from each other by equal distance (2 cm). The 9th key is cut out on the opposite side of the pipe (between first and the second keys). Thus, the salamuri is divided into three parts: the head or neck part, body or the key part and the ending. Each of them has its own size and a certain interrelation. The closer the first key is to the reed of the instrument the more high-pitched sound is produced. Salamuris are usually played by men. The reeded salamuri is widely spread all over Georgia. Salamuri started its existence in pastoral atmosphere. Consequently, salamuri's repertoire mainly consists of shepherd melodies. It was often accompanied combined with ‚ÄúDoli‚Äù (drum). The reeded salamuri seems to be originated a bit later than the unreeded one and it was the widest spread folk instrument all over Georgia. That is made evident not only by the legends but also by the monuments of classical literature. According to the people's belief, the sorrows of human being were the reason for making the salamuri. The legend says that when the first reed grew up on the orphan's grave, the wind blew and the reed moaned in a sad voice. Salamuri was an inseparable close friend of a farmer that cheered him up in times of sorrow and sweetened his merriments. According to people's belief, nothing can destroy a reed pipe; even fire cannot damage it. The parents‚Äô faces are seen through its ashes and even the broken parts emit sweet tunes. According to some of the legends, people were presented with this instrument by God. That is why it is considered to be a divine musical instrument. Georgian people, when creating each musical instrument tried resemble the nature's sounds with them. For instance, the salamuri's tunes sounds like birds‚Äô song. According to legends, salamuri's tunes cheered people up, tamed animals, makes birds sing, its sad tunes relieved human sorrows. According to one tale, the salamuri's sad tunes could even make the grass cry. Professional salamuri players say that there is a difference between techniques of performance on these instruments: the reeded salamuri is more difficult to play than the unreeded one. However, one can play any melody he/she wants on the reeded salamuri. The technical abilities of the unreeded salamuri are limited. When designing the salamuri, masters take into account with which instrument it is going to be played. According to this, they define the octave range of the instrument. The masters can design two kinds of salamuris: I-part and II-part (deep-voiced salamuri is also produced). Today this instrument has a stable place in Georgian folk ensembles. It has been traveling all over the world together with the spirited Georgian dances and has been spreading the sweet tunes of the Iberian salamuri.

During the recording process of Tiff Lacey's solo album, it was considered that \\"Take Me Away\\" would be a good choice both to be included on the album and to be released as its lead single, because of the funky, catchy sound, combined with fresh lyrics and Lacey's good vocal performance.

The location and people of this city has been the subject of much scholarly debate in Islam. In the Quran According to the Quran, God sent two prophets to this particular community. When the people of the city refused to hear their words, God sent a third prophet to strengthen them. The prophets told the people: \\"Truly we have been sent on a mission to you\\". The community mocked the message of the prophets and said \\"Ye are only men like ourselves; and the Most Gracious sends no sort of revelation: ye do nothing but lie.\\" The prophets, in reply, rebuked the community, saying: \\"Our Lord doth know that we have been sent on a mission to you: \\"And our duty is only to proclaim the clear Message.\\" The Quran goes onto say that the prophets were threatened with stoning and torture, but they refused to give in and continued to warn the people to end their sinful ways. Then, from the farthest part of the city, there came running a man who exhorted the people to believe the message and told them: \\"O my people! Obey the messengers: \\"Obey those who ask no reward of you (for themselves), and who have themselves received Guidance. The following verses, which describe the man's entrance in to \\"the garden\\" (Jannah), which refers to Heaven, has been interpreted by some scholars to mean that the believing man was martyred for his faith.Stories of the Prophets, Ibn Kathir, People of Ya-Sin Accounts in exegesis Classical commentators on the Quran popularly identified the \\"People of the City\\" with the city of Antioch. Those scholars who identified the city with Antioch, however, were divided over the date of the event. One group believed that this event took place after Jesus and explained that the Quran's use of the word \\"Messenger\\" in this context refers not to three prophets but to three of Jesus's disciples who were sent to Antioch to proclaim the message. The name of this martyr is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in Qur'an or Hadith, though he is known as The Believer of YaSin.Muhammad, Martin Lings, Chapter XXVIII Ibn Kathir in his Tafsir (Commentary) on Quran 36 references a rumor that identifies the three disciples sent were Sham\`un (Peter), Yuhanna (John) and the name of the third was Bulus (Paul). (Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged), Volume 8, Surat Al-Ahzab, Verse 51 to the end of Surat Ad-Dukhan, abridged under a group of scholars under the supervision of Shaykh Safiur Rahman Al- Mubarakpuri [Darussalam Publishers & Distributors Riyadh, Houston, New York, London, Lahore; First Edition, September 2000], p. 179) https://www.answering- islam.org/Shamoun/christs_apostles.htm https://quranx.com/tafsirs/36.13. Other commentators who believe that the city does refers to Antioch, explained that this is the narrative of a far older incident, and that the three \\"messengers\\" mentioned were indeed prophets, namely Saduq, Masduq and Shalum.A-Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism, Wheeler, People of Ya-Sin Abdullah Yusuf Ali did link the narrative of the story with the preaching of Paul and Barnabas as described in Acts of the Apostles.

Summary  Gabrielle Bellocq has been acknowledged as a great artist by the most respected and authoritative of Europe's Artistic Institutions: Salon des Artistes Francais (the highest awards of gold, silver and bronze medals received), Salon d'Automne in Paris and the Royal Academy of Arts in London. A purchase by the French State for the National Collection in 1980 places Gabrielle Bellocq amongst France's greatest artists of the 20th century. Her numerous personal exhibitions in Europe, America and Japan have always attracted enthusiastic collectors. Gabrielle Bellocq was born in 1920 and has lived most of her life in the West of France, near the sea. Painting was her passion since childhood. Her many years of work and experimentation in pastel have resulted in a technique which is unique and still mystifies her fellow pastellists - virtually a new medium. Through this technique she could render impressionistic effects which even Van Gogh, Monet and Degas were unable to achieve with pastels. The wide success of Gabrielle Bellocq's work can largely be attributed to her undoubted talent as a colourist: the incredible variety of colours, sometimes daringly bright, often incredibly subtle, full of fine nuances and with a pointillist touch produces an unusual perspective effect. Her landscapes and seascapes clearly remind us of the style of the great impressionists, and yet because she never painted from life but from her inspired inner vision, her paintings have a magical dreamlike quality. Through her delightful figures from ancient times, she invites the viewer to join in her communion with nature. We go with them towards the light as through their eyes we are taken to places of marvelous beauty, tranquility and inner peace.  Her Life  Her mother, an artistic lady, taught her piano and singing and organised one-to-one painting lessons with nuns at the couvent de Saint-Sornin, who were not artists to the highest degree. She was taught to copy others' work. The only painting and drawing classes that she was given was by these nuns. As a boarder at school from a very young age, she spent her Sundays between Sunday Mass, Vespers and walks in the Vendee countryside. Throughout this period she built up a library of images that she later reproduced in the form of neo-impressionist pastel paintings. Around 1950, she came to live on the banks of the River Rance in a classic Malouini√®re (manor house) blessed with a pretty pond. We often find reproduced in her paintings this mansion house and pond, in a more or less idealised form. She started painting again at the start of the 1960s. Little by little, she abandoned watercolours and guache to concentrate solely on using pastels, which she would dedicate herself to using during more than 30 years, for the entirety of every day. The only time she stopped was when her children and grand-children came to stay. She has exhibited profusely around the world, including in Paris, Windsor, Henley-on-Thames and Salisbury, Osaka (Japan), Chicago (Illinois), Sedona (Arizona) and Ede (Netherlands). She died in the summer of 1999 and rests in the cemetery in Saint-Briac.  Her Major Prizes  In 1978, the purchase by the French Ministry of Culture of her painting Ouverture sur l‚Äôoc√©an (Opening onto the Ocean) for the National Collection confirmed the stature of this artist, and the prizes flowed. Some of the major ones are as follows: * 1977 : Honourable Mention at the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais (Equivalent of the Royal Academy in the UK), * 1978 : Prix Blanche Roullier, * 1979 : Prix Marie Bashkirtseff, Prix Atrux-Beauclair de la Fondation Baron Taylor, Prix Blanche Roullier, * 1980 : M√©daille d‚ÄôArgent du Salon des Artistes fran√ßais, Prix Blanche Roullier, * 1981 : Prix Raybaud, * 1983 : Prix Blanche Roullier, * 1984 : M√©daille d‚ÄôOr du Salon des Artistes fran√ßais, * 1987 : Grand Prix de la ville de Dinard.

History The band was formed in 2005 by guitarist and songwriter Du≈°an Svilokos ƒêuriƒá, female vocalist Milena Brankoviƒá, and bass guitarist Petar \\"Pera\\" Popoviƒá. Keyboardist Marko Antoniƒá, and drummer Zoran Joviƒá \\"ƒêavo\\" were soon added to their ranks and the five-piece band started working on songs for their debut album, entering the studio in 2006. The band was performing and releasing albums for their domestic market under the name \\"Trigger\\", until they added \\"The\\" to their name in 2019, for legal reasons, as their first album in English for the international market was about to be released. The band's debut album Ljubav (Love) was released in December 2007 through PGP-RTS. Ljubav was imagined as a concept album, featuring lyrics dealing with dark sides of love. The album was met with mostly positive reactions by the critics. The promotional video was recorded for the song \\"Jedan dan\\" (\\"A Day\\"). \\"Jedan dan\\" won the first place on TV Panonija chart, TV Metropolis Top 10 chart, and Radio 202 Hit of the Week chart. During the same year, the band started the concert promotion of the album, starting with the appearance on Belgrade Beer Fest. In 2008, the band was awarded with the Discovery of the Year Award by TV Metropolis, and was polled the Best Young Band of 2008 by the listeners of the Radio 202 show Hit 202. In 2009, the band released the live mini-album Metropolis Live, consisting of five songs from Ljubav, recorded in 2008 at the band's performance in the TV Metropolis show Metropolis Live. The album was available for free via a digital download at the band's official site. In 2009, the band also recorded the video for the song \\"Vi≈°e neƒáe biti nas\\" (\\"There Will Be no more of Us\\"), and won the Metal Album of the Award at the Sarajevo Indexi Awards Ceremony. The band also appeared on a New York City Hard Rock Radio Live compilation. In 2010, Du≈°an Svilokos ƒêuriƒá and Milena Brankoviƒá, under the name \\"Disparador\\", appeared on the various artists album Vreme brutalnih dobronamernika, which featured seventeen bands which recorded songs of poems of a Serbian poet Milan B. Popoviƒá. Disparador participated in the compilation with the gothic industrial-oriented song \\"Pokrov iznad mene\\" (\\"Shroud above Me\\"). In 2011, the band announced the release of a new studio album, entitled EX, which will feature covers of songs by former Yugoslav new wave artists. The band promoted their upcoming album with a concert in Belgrade club Danguba, featuring guest appearance by the heavy metal band Forever Storm. The first part of the album, containing covers of Piloti song \\"Ne veruj u idole\\" (\\"Do not Believe in Idols\\"), Azra song \\"Kurvini sinovi\\" (\\"Sons of Whores\\"), and Haustor song \\"Ena\\", was available for free download from the band's official website in May 2011. The second part of the album, featuring a cover of VIS Simboli song \\"Bejbi, bejbi\\" (\\"Baby, Baby\\"), a cover of Bulevar song \\"Trenutni lek\\" (\\"Momentary Remedy\\") and a cover of Petar i Zli Vuci song \\"Ogledalo\\" (\\"Mirror\\"), was released for free download in May 2012. The third and final part of the album, featuring a cover of Jakarta song \\"Spiritus\\" and a cover of Beograd song \\"Opasne igre\\" (\\"Dangerous Games\\"), was released in November 2012. Keyboardist Marko Antoniƒá leaves the band after EX, and instead of looking for a replacement keyboard player, the band continues as a four-piece. In July 2013, the band released the single \\"Ne hrani ljudo≈ædere\\" (\\"Do Not Feed the Cannibals\\"), featuring guest appearance by Downstroy vocalist Darko ≈Ωivkoviƒá. The single announced the band's upcoming studio album. After releasing singles \\"Sreƒána nova\\" and \\"Ponor\\", featuring guest appearance by Block Out vocalist Milutin \\"Mita\\" Joviƒçiƒá, The Trigger got their third album \\"Vreme ƒçuda\\" out in 2015 with the \\"Odliƒçan hrƒçak\\" label. The band also added a new member, Bo≈æidar Mladenoviƒá (Ex By-Pass) as a second guitarist. Along with Darko ≈Ωivkoviƒá and Milutin Jovanƒçiƒá, the album featured guest appearances of Manntra vocalist marko Matijeviƒá Sekul on the song \\"Bum\\", Vladimir Laliƒá (Organized Chaos, Viva Vox) and guitar virtuoso Emir Hot on the song \\"Realiti\\", Borko Basariƒá (Azil 5), Dragana Mijatoviƒá (Hype), Ljiljana Zdravkoviƒá (The Bite), Katarina Popoviƒá (Aetar) and others. The album got positive reviews: Serbian Metal chose Vreme ƒçuda as the domestic metal album of the Year, and Balkanrock has included the album in the \\"Best regional rock albums\\" list for 2015. Stylistically, the album shows the band gravitating towards modern metal guitar driven sound with less electronic and gothic influences compared to Ljubav, but still exploring new territory in songs like the nine minute album closer \\"Ponor\\" that channels a lot of progressive and ambient influences. After Vreme ƒçuda, The Trigger focused on finishing their first album in the English language, for the international market. In 2019, the band announced that it has signed a record deal with Massacre Records. At the same time, the band changed the name to \\"The Trigger\\" to avoid possible legal complications, as the name \\"Trigger\\" has also been in use by other bands. After releasing singles \\"Pray\\" and \\"What Have We Become\\", their fourth album, \\"The Time of Miracles\\" was released in 2019. The album consists of reworked material from previous albums and features some of the guests from Vreme ƒåuda, now performing their vocal parts in English. The Time of Miracles got generally positive reviews.

Early life and education  Robert Leo Byrne, son of Tom and Clara Byrne, was born on May 22, 1930, and raised in Dubuque, Iowa.The Byrne Family History, self-published, Linda Byrne Brown, 2001 He attended St. Columbkille's elementary, Loras Academy, and Loras College.Byrne's novel Memories of a Non-Jewish Childhood is loosely based on his own childhood He left Dubuque to attend Iowa State University, where his first sign of talent as a writer emerged as he edited a humor column in the school's newspaper. He transferred to University of Colorado, where he edited Flatiron, the school's humor publication, and he graduated in 1954 with a degree in civil engineering. Byrne began his career in 1954 as a Junior Civil Engineer for the City and County of San Francisco, Department of Engineering, Bureau of Public Works, Division of Highways.  Writing career  In 1955, a year later, he found a way to combine his engineering and writing talents by joining Western Construction magazine as a reporter for the heavy construction industry. In 1961, he was named editor of the magazine, a position he held for over ten years. Byrne became a full-time writer in 1977 after the publication of his third book. He is the author of seven novels, five collections of humorous quotations, seven books on billiards, two anthologies, and an expos√© of frauds in the literary world. One of his novels, Thrill, was made into NBC‚Äôs Monday Night Movie, which aired for the first time on May 20, 1996. Four of his novels were selections of Reader's Digest Condensed Books and published in over a dozen languages. Byrne's unusual mix of talents as a writer, engineer and billiard player formed the right skill set to create what would become one of the definitive instructional works on cue sports. Byrne‚Äôs Standard Book of Pool and Billiards, published in 1978 and expanded in 1998, has sold over 500,000 copies. It is one of the very few such works that includes diagrams that are mathematically and physically accurate, with lines plotting the path of the center of the balls, which therefore do not touch the cushions of the table. [Clarification: Geometrical explanations in billiards often simplify bounces off the rails (\\"banks\\") as occurring where the ball touches the rail (the \\"cushion\\") and use this point as a focus during aiming the shot. More accurately, Byrne made the distinction that aiming lines use the centers of balls rather than their edges. If a bank was to be planned better, it was necessary to visualize that the bounce line ends a half-ball away from the rail when the ball's center recoils to the new direction. (Even then, this isn't perfectly accurate because the rail deforms as a ball bounces against it, and Byrne always noted that other factors -- such as ball speed and spin -- were equally at play in predicting the angle of a bank.)] As described by Byrne in an interview with Shelley Till on the local public-access television program On the Edge with Shelley Till Byrne coined the pool jargon term \\"\\" in this book, defining the deflection effect that sends the toward the right when struck with left , and vice versa. Byrne's books, hundreds of instructional magazine articles, seven instructional videos (shot on sound stages in Burbank and Hollywood, California), have established him as the preeminent teacher and commentator in the world of pool and billiards. He has been a columnist and Contributing Editor for Billiard Digest magazine since its first issue in 1978, and a columnist for Dubuque's Telegraph Herald since 2000. His most recent publication is Behold My Shorts, a collection of a decade of his monthly newspaper columns. In 1994 on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, he received the Industry Service Award from the Billiard and Bowling Institute of America, an honor previously bestowed on Willie Mosconi, Paul Newman, and Jackie Gleason. In 1998, the readers of Billiards Digest named Byrne \\"Best Billiards Writer\\". His contributions to billiards and pool were recognized with induction into the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame. The honor, perhaps the greatest in the field, was bestowed for Meritorious Service, on July 21, 2001, at the Las Vegas Hilton at a banquet closing the annual International Billiard & Home Recreation Expo. He was inducted with many-time World Three-cushion Billiards Champion Raymond Ceulemans of Belgium. As of May, 2011, he is nearly finished with a new collection of humorous quotations.  Playing career  Byrne's first success as a pool hustler came at the age of 12 when he beat the gas meter reader out of 85 cents on the family home's basement pool table in a game of 8-ball. As a player, he has ranked in U.S. national-class tournaments in multiple disciplines: * Champion, National Senior Billiard Tournament, 1999 * Champion, National Amateur Athletic Club Billiards Tournament, 1999 * Third place, National Professional Three-Cushion Championship, 1977 * Fourth place, National Professional Three- Cushion Championship, 1968 Byrne performed the pool trick shots for The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles in 1993. He has had a three-cushion billiards of 14, at age 29 and again at 79. The last time he ran his age in straight pool was Age 78.  Personal life  On May 12, 1958, Byrne married Josefa Heifetz, concert pianist and daughter of legendary violinist Jascha Heifetz. On May 16, 1962, Josefa gave birth to Russell Heifetz Byrne, their only child, who now works as a network consulting engineer for Cisco Systems. Byrne and Heifetz were divorced in 1976. On May 9, 1991, Byrne married Cynthia Nelms, a graphic artist and painter, who struck his fancy by sending him an extremely well- written fan letter. After living in California for nearly 40 years, Byrne moved back to his childhood home of Dubuque, Iowa with Cindy in 1996, which was not without complications due to the controversial nature of his semi- autobiographical novel Memories of a Non-Jewish Childhood. Byrne's civic involvement in Dubuque includes serving as president of the Friends of Wahlert Library, Loras College, and as a boardmember of both the Dubuque Symphony Orchestra and Dubuque Museum of Art. Byrne is also an amateur stage magician, is a member of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, and has published tricks in Genie magazine. He was once a Class A tournament chess player, with a United States Chess Federation rating over 1800.

The novel was renamed Analogue Men starting with the 1962 Berkley Books version, but regained its original title with a 1971 paperback edition.ISFDB publication history The original title is based on the aphorism that says that \\"The road to hell is paved with good intentions\\". Synopsis Early in the novel, one of the characters gives a description of the analogue treatment: > \\"He's got an analogue,\\" said Martyn. \\"In the classical sense, he is even > less sane than he was before. He has auditory, visual and tactile > hallucinationsa complete, integrated set. That's enough to get you entry to > most institutions, crowded as they are. But, you see, these hallucinations > are pro-societal. They were put there deliberately. He's an acceptable > member of society, because he has them...Nobody knows [what the analogue > looks like] except himself. A policeman, maybe, or his mother as she looked > when he was a child. Someone whom he fears, and whose authority he > acknowledges. The subconscious has its own mechanism for creating these > false images; all we do is stimulate itit does the rest.\\" Most of the story takes place in the 22nd century after analogue treatments have been universally applied for more than 100 years. The United States has broken up into semi-autonomous regions in which the analogue treatment is used to enforce whatever societal norms benefit the ruling classes. The narrative centers on Arthur Bass, who realizes at an early age that he is an \\"immune\\", i.e. resistant to the analogue treatment. Bass is identified and recruited by the members of a clandestine group of immunes who are working to overthrow the analogue system. Critical response In Voices for the Future: Essays on Major Science Fiction Writers, Thomas D. Clareson wrote: \\"The chief pleasures of the novel come from Knight's inventiveness. The society he portrays is vividely exhibited.\\" Groff Conklin praised the novel for providing \\"a tense experience in a mad and tragic world of tomorrow.\\"\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, September 1955, p.91 Anthony Boucher gave Hell's Pavement a mixed review, praising its \\"dazzling ingenuity and plausibility,\\" but concluding that it never add[ed] up to a consecutive coherent story.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, June 1955, pp.76. P. Schuyler Miller rated it \\"no masterpiece, but one of the better pieces of science-fictive entertainment out this year [1955].Miller, P. Schuyler. \\"The Reference Library,\\" Astounding Science-Fiction, September 1955, p.151.

Biography  Costas Tsicaderis was born in Katerini in the north of Greece in 1945, and his family migrated to Australia in 1954, when Costas was nine years old. In Greece his father ran a taverna, but in Australia he ended up at the General Motors Holden plant in Melbourne. Costas completed his schooling in Melbourne and became a draughtsman running his own business. Later he studied architecture at the RMIT and went on to teach the subject at Preston TAFE. At high school Costas began to play the guitar and developed an interest in folk music. He first presented some of his compositions to audiences in 1974. In the 1980s he formed the Costas Tsicaderis Ensemble. He had a long association with the Melbourne cultural support group and \\"world music caf√©\\" The Boite, where he was a regular performer. For many years he presented a weekly programme of Greek music for the community radio station 3ZZZ (mid 1990s to 2000). He also presented a programme for 3XY (late 1990s to his death). In 2001 he produced a compilation CD for 3ZZZ funded by AMRAP. Of this he wrote: \\"One of the most exciting activities for me last year was my involvement as producer in 3ZZZ‚Äôs CD Routes of Rhythm, a compilation of six exciting and previously unrecorded Melbourne groups.\\" This was followed by a second CD Routes of Rhythm 2, which Costas also produced. Costas Tsicaderis died suddenly on 23 December 2004 aged 59. \\"The Music of Costas Tsicaderis\\", a feature that was produced for ABC radio in 1985, was aired again on the ABC National Radio programme Music Deli as a tribute. The Melbourne Greek newspaper Neos Kosmos named him 2004 Greek of the Year. Close friends and colleagues established The Costas Tsicaderis Memorial Foundation with the aim of providing financial assistance to promising young musicians. A tribute concert and launch of the CD The Mighty and the Humble was presented by The Boite and the Costas Tsicaderis Memorial Foundation on 1 December 2006 at BMW Edge, Federation Square, Melbourne.  Musical works  His music has been described as belonging \\"firmly in the popular tradition defined and developed by Hatzidakis, Theodorakis, and other Greek composers who set Greek poetry to music\\", and as characterised by \\"gentle melodies and orchestration with bitter-sweet and often nostalgic lyrics\\".Review of Costas Tsicaderis, Live at the Boite by Pavlos Andronikos (Antipodes no. 20, November 1986) The song \\"The Pomegranate\\" was singled out for particular praise by critics: \\"His setting of Dimitris Tsaloumas' poem \\"The Pomegranate\\", is a consummate example of antipodean Greek art.\\"Quoted from \\"Musician United Greek Community\\" by Stathis Gauntlett and Arnold Zable, The Age, Wednesday 19 January 2005. And: \\"The song as such is ‚Ä¶ superb‚Äîthe lyrics and the melody are perfectly matched, and the melody has the simplicity and coherence of structure which go to make a classic.\\"Review of Costas Tsicaderis, Live at the Boite by Pavlos Andronikos (Antipodes no. 20, November 1986) Also singled out was his setting to music of Nikos Ninolakis‚Äô poem \\"Select a Day\\". One critic described it as \\"an absolutely marvellous song,\\" and added \\"I especially like the way the melody rises unexpectedly in the chorus on the word Œ≠Œ∫œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒ∑ so that in retrospect one feels that it has been killing time, waiting for that climactic, ecstatic moment.Review of Costas Tsicaderis, Live at the Boite by Pavlos Andronikos (Antipodes no. 20, November 1986)  Discography  The Costas Tsicaderis discography includes a total of 24 songs composed by Tsicaderis himself.

Hutchinson has multiple plants in China, Poland, and the United States. Recently, the company has pushed to digitize all their plants to optimize processes.  Research  Hutchinson has a history of creating products to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The company participates in European Commission funded research initiatives such as Clean Sky, the goal of which is to reduce the impact of air travel on the environment. Hutchinson is the coordinator of two Clean Sky 2 projects focusing on air treatment and temperature control in aircraft. In 2017, the company hosted a student research competition in the 507 Fab House. Hutchinson and its partner Electreon are members of The Smart Road Gotland Consortium, the goal of which is to develop electric roads. The technology allows vehicles to charge while driving via coils embedded in the roadway. Electrive explains, ‚ÄúThe coils are embedded eight centimetres below the surface, invisible to road users, and only activated when a vehicle drives over them.‚Äù Hutchinson manufactures these coils. In April of 2019, the Swedish Transit Authority announced that the consortium won the bid to build the world‚Äôs first dynamic inductive-charging electric road system on the island of Gotland.  Major Acquisitions  Hutchinson has acquired many companies with varying expertise. In 1974 Hutchinson acquired Paulstra, a company which specializes in vibration and acoustic insulation. The company made multiple acquisitions in 2019. In January, Hutchinson announced the acquisition of an American parts manufacturer called Mid√© Technology. In September, Hutchinson acquired a thermal management company called TCSA from Mann+Hummel. ‚ÄúTCSA is now a joint venture between the two companies, dedicated to thermal management and cooling systems for vehicles, particularly EV and HEV and integrated in Hutchinson‚Äôs FMS (Fluid Management Systems) activity.‚Äù Later that month, Hutchinson announced its acquisition of German aerospace company, PFW.The acquisition was completed in January 2020.

It has no moving parts. Operation A pulser pump makes use of water that flows through pipes and an air chamber from an upper reservoir to a lower reservoir. The intake is a trompe, which uses water flow to pump air to a separation chamber; air trapped in the chamber then drives an airlift pump. The top of the pipe that connects the upper reservoir to the air chamber is positioned just below the water surface. As the water drops down the pipe, air is sucked down with it. The air forms a \\"bubble\\" near the roof of the air chamber. A narrow riser pipe extends from the air chamber up to the higher elevation to which the water will be pumped. Initially the water level will be near the roof of the air chamber. As air accumulates, pressure builds, which will push water up into the riser pipe. At some point the \\"air bubble\\" will extend below the bottom of the riser pipe, which will allow some of the air to escape through the riser, pushing the water that is already in the pipe up with it. As the air escapes, the water level in the air chamber will rise again. The alternating pressure build up and escape causes a pulsing effect, hence the name: pulser pump. The maximum air pressure that can accumulate depends on the height of the water column between the air chamber and the lower reservoir. The deeper the air chamber is positioned, the higher the elevation to which the water can be pumped. The depth of the air chamber position is limited by the depth to which the flowing water can pull the air from the surface of the upper reservoir down to the chamber. This depth partially depends on the speed of the water, which in turn depends on the difference in height between the upper and lower reservoir. History Brian White, stonemason by profession, claims to have invented the pulser pump in 1987. He put the idea in the public domain. However, Charles H. Taylor invented the hydraulic air compressor before the year 1910 while living in Montreal. The working principle of the hydraulic air compressor and the pulser pump is exactly the same. But the purpose of the compressor is to generate compressed air. Expelling the water up to 30 meter high serves to prevent potentially damaging over-pressure. The primary purpose of the pulser pump is to use the air pressure to expel the water to a higher elevation.

He founded two successful high-tech companies (RadiSys and IP Fabrics), authored eight textbooks in the computer sciences, and made important contributions in microprocessor architecture. He holds a number of patents, including the original patent on \\"register scoreboarding\\" in microprocessor chips. He has a BS in electrical engineering from Clarkson University, an MS in computer science from Syracuse University, and a PhD in computer science from the Polytechnic Institute of New York University.  Career  = IBM = Myers joined IBM in 1968 in its Poughkeepsie, N.Y. lab. After spending a few years working on developments associated with the System/360 mainframes, he moved to the prestigious IBM Systems Research Institute in New York City. There he headed up a small team of people developing an advanced computer system named \\"SWARD\\" (Software Oriented Architecture) incorporating such concepts as tagged storage, capability-based addressing, organization by objects, and a single-level store. The machine was built and successfully operated in 1980. During this period, Myers also authored his first four books, including The Art of Software Testing, a book that became a classic and a best-seller in the computer science field, staying in print for 26 years before it was replaced by a second edition in 2004. Myers also served as a lecturer in computer science at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University, where he taught graduate-level courses in computer science. Years later, he was the 1988 recipient of the J.-D. Warnier Prize for his contributions to the field of software engineering. = Intel = In early 1981 Myers was hired from IBM by the then-small company called Intel to build a new organization to head off the leadership Motorola seemed to be gaining with its \\"clean\\" 68000 chip rather than Intel's more-difficult- to-program 8086. This project, code named the \\"P4\\", became less critical to Intel when IBM, later that year, announced the IBM PC using a variant of the Intel 8086. To coordinate Intel's strategy, Myers was appointed Manager of Microprocessor Product-Line Architecture to manage a number of efforts, including the movement of the 8086 and successors to a 32-bit architecture called the Intel 80386 (386), in which Myers played a key role in making many of the early decisions, the Intel iAPX 432, a very unconventional design from Intel's team in Oregon, the Intel i860, a type of RISC vector-processing machine, and the RISC-oriented 80960 (i960). Myers also chaired Intel's Microprocessor Strategic Business Segment, part of Intel's strategic long- range planning process. In 1983, Myers moved to Oregon to take personal charge of the design of the i960 microprocessor. The i960 was the first microprocessor chip that could execute multiple instructions in parallel. In 1986, Myers co-authored an invited paper with Intel senior vice presidents Albert Yu and Dave House that outlined Intel's microprocessor thinking for the next 10 years. In 1990, Myers, for his work on the i960 microprocessor, was one of three finalists for Discover Magazine's Awards for Technological Innovation = RadiSys = In 1987, Myers and key i960 chip manager Dave Budde left Intel and founded RadiSys Corporation. Myers took the roles of CEO and Chairman, positions he held until 2002. A number of other Intel employees quickly joined the new venture, all of whom worked for no salary and instead invested money in the startup (in trade for stock). Because 1987 turned out to be one of the worst periods in history for raising venture capital, the early employees moonlighted to keep RadiSys afloat; for instance, Myers returned to Intel as a consultant on the design of the Intel 80486 processor chip. After operating on a shoe string for a year, RadiSys raised $6.5 million from three unconventional sources: Tektronix, State Farm Insurance, and the State of Oregon. By 1992, RadiSys had sales of over $10 million, 61 employees, and was 90th on the Inc. 500 of fastest-growing private companies. In 1995, RadiSys became a publicly traded company (symbol RSYS) when it held an initial public offering (IPO). The company then grew rapidly, in part because of a series of acquisitions, including a division of Intel, two small operations from IBM, and several other private companies. In 2000, under Myers' leadership, RadiSys had revenues of $341 million, net income of $33 million, a market cap in excess of $1 billion, and 1153 employees. The company became increasingly focused on the telecommunications market, with Nokia being its largest customer and representing over 20% of its revenue. In 2002, after a series of disagreements with the board of directors, Myers left and formed IP Fabrics, and nine other key RadiSys managers and engineers quickly joined him there. = IP Fabrics = Myers, along with nine others who left RadiSys, founded IP Fabrics in 2002 and became its CEO. He raised $8 million in venture capital from Intel Capital, Ignition Partners, Northwest Venture Associates, and Frazier Technology Partners. Initially, IP Fabrics' business was providing a virtualization environment for highly parallel network processors, with the starting point being Intel's IXP network processors. However, when Intel decided to exit this business, IP Fabrics quickly changed its direction to that of providing communications interception systems using the previously developed network-processor software and hardware within. For instance, within the U.S., IP Fabrics provides systems for intercepting voice over IP (VoIP) and Internet communications to law-enforcement agencies and telecommunications carriers for adherence to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA).http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=140008&site;=lr_cable lightreading.com. Accessed March 18, 2011. It also provides products for the interception of instant messaging services, social networking services, email, webmail, and other types of traffic. Myers also serves as chairman of the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) Lawfully Authorized Electronic Surveillance subcommittee, an organization of law-enforcement and other government agencies and telecommunications carriers and equipment suppliers that develops standards for wiretapping.http://www.atis.org/0191/index.asp ATIS.

It reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and number six on the Billboard R&B; chart in 1958. The song sold over a million copies and the group appeared on several television shows, including The Gisele MacKenzie Show (March 15, 1958) and The Ed Sullivan Show. The main theme is summed up in the last line in the refrain, stating that Santa Catalina is \\"the island of romance\\", with the word \\"romance\\" repeated four times. Credits *Conductor [Orchestra]: Lincoln Mayorga (tracks: B) *Writers: Bruce Belland, Glenn Larson* History At the age of 15, the band's lead singer Bruce Belland broke his ankle and took up the ukulele to pass the time while recuperating. He learned four chords, which ended up becoming the song's opening music. The chorus was developed some time later when, while body surfing at a California beach, Belland's friend said he could see Santa Catalina 26 miles away. In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the group amassed eight gold singles and three gold albums. Its million-selling signature tunes included \\"26 Miles,\\" \\"Big Man,\\" \\"Lazy Summer Night,\\" and \\"Down by the Station.\\" Bruce Belland, Ed Cobb, Marv Ingram, and Glen Larson were students at Hollywood High School and were signed to a recording contract by Capitol Records, after one of Capitol's executives saw them at a talent show at that school in 1956. Their biggest hit was \\"26 Miles (Santa Catalina),\\" which reached number 2 in 1958. The record sold over one million copies, earning a gold disc. Glen Larson also receives credit for writing the song, as he contributed to the lyrics. Cover versions The song was covered by Dent May on his album Dent May & His Magnificent Ukulele. Influences The song served as an influence to Beach Boys singer Brian Wilson, as well as Jimmy Buffett. Neil Peart, lyricist/drummer of the band Rush, recalls that it is one of the first pop music songs that he remembers listening to as a child, stating \\"I heard that song many times that year (1958). The chorus echoes readily in memory, with its lilting shuffle.\\" In popular culture The song was one of many California-related songs played throughout \\"Sunshine Plaza\\" in the original Disney California Adventure. The song was featured playing on a radio in the opening scene of Bad Times at the El Royale.

The NGO included MƒÉnescu in its investigative report on the European politicians who advocate for Azerbaijan.

The final report and the composition of the delegation was not published by the European People's Party. According to above mentioned report \\"the composition of the delegation can only be deduced from the media quotes and pictures from the media and official presidential website. In these pictures, for example, besides those specifically mentioned in the media, an MEP Ramona Manescu could be seen during the meeting with Aliyev and the press-conference. A week earlier she was on an EU-Azerbaijan Parliamentary Cooperation Committee visit to Baku, where she could be seen posing next to Aliyev.

Superior Court (30 Cal.Rptr.3d 76) is a 2005 case where the California Supreme Court ruled that an arbitration clause was unenforceable because a class-action waiver contained within it would exculpate Discover Bank from liability for wrongdoing involving small sums of damages.  Background  The Discover Card cardholder agreement required any disputes be handled through an arbitration agreement. The company was accused of miscalculating late fees that would be very small dollar amounts for individual consumers but, in the aggregate, would be a large sum of money. The arbitration itself was not disputed but class action status was requested and denied by the company, based on Delaware law. The Superior Court certified the group under California law. Discover then appealed that decision. Decision Carlos R. Moreno, in the majority opinion, stated the Discover Bank test to determine whether a class-action waiver is unenforceable. Under the Discover Bank test, a class-action waiver will be unenforceable under California law when it appears in a \\"consumer contract of adhesion\\", when the disputes \\"predictably involve small amounts of damages\\", and where the plaintiff alleges that \\"the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money\\".30 Cal.Rptr.3d at 87 The United States Supreme Court overruled Discover Bank in a 5‚Äì4 decision in the 2011 case AT&T; Mobility v.

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1960 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as WPB-82304 when commissioned and acquired the name Point League in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .Coast Guard Historian websiteScheina, p 72 Construction and design details Point League was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.Scheina, p 71 She was powered by two VT600 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360-degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point League included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air- conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode. Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.Scotti, p 10Scotti, p 219 History After delivery in 1960, Point League was assigned a homeport of Morgan City, Louisiana, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. At the request of the United States Navy, in October 1965, she was alerted for service in South Vietnam and assigned to Coast Guard Squadron One in support of Operation Market Time along with 8 other Point class cutters.Larzelere, p 72Cutler, p 84 While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, Point League was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to Subic Bay, Philippines arriving in January 1966 where she was refitted for combat service. Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of 4 M2 machine guns. The original Oerlikon 20 mm cannon was replaced with a combination over-under .50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam.Larzelere, p 21Cutler, p 82 For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.Larzelere, p 15 While finishing training exercises at Subic Bay the main drive engine alarms sounded on the bridge and during an investigation by the cutter's engineers it was found that major damage had occurred to one of the main drive engines. Overhaul parts were sent from Division 12 in Da Nang and the cutter engineers completed the overhaul and initial run-in of the engine in 72 hours, just in time for the scheduled departure of the division for Vietnam. The final break-in of the repaired engine was completed while in transit.Larzelere, p 75 Point League was assigned to Division 13 of Squadron One to be based at Cat Lo Naval Base near Vung Tau, along with , , , , , , and . After sea trials, the Division left Subic Bay for Cat Lo on 19 February 1966 in the company of , their temporary support ship. They arrived at their new duty station on 23 February and began patrolling the coastal waters near the Rung Sat Special Zone.Kelley, p 5‚Äì450Larzelere, p 80 Duty consisted of boarding Vietnamese junks to search for contraband weapons and ammunition and check the identification papers of persons on board. On 20 June 1966 Point League along with Point Hudson and Point Slocum assisted with the capture of a North Vietnamese trawler loaded with ammunition near the mouth of the C·ªï Chi√™n River.Larzelere, p 70Johnson, p 334 During the month of September 1966 Point League responded to a distress call from the SS Dragonfly by helping dewater a flooded compartment and putting one of the cutter's engineers on the merchant ship temporarily to replace the injured chief engineer.Tulich, p 7 As a part of the Vietnamization program Republic of Vietnam Navy (RVNN) crewmen were assigned to the cutter for training purposes beginning in February 1969. After the crew of Point League trained an RVNN replacement crew, she was turned over to the RVNN and recommissioned as RVNS L√™ Ph∆∞·ªõc ƒê·ª©c (HQ-700), 16 May 1969 at the Saigon Navy Base.

Skinner is commonly known by the name Donald Ross Skinner with the addition of the middle name of Ross attributed to him by Cope after Glenn Ross Campbell, the pedal steel player from The Misunderstood. He is currently a guitarist for Love Amongst Ruin and DC Fontana. Pre-Cope career Skinner played in a number of Tamworth bands including The Fretz, DHSS (named after the Department of Health and Social Security) and Freight train. Julian Cope Band After the split of The Teardrop Explodes Julian retreated to his home town of Tamworth and the 18-year-old Skinner visited the singer's home on a number of occasions. Skinner was subsequently invited to join Cope's band and to play on a Kid Jensen radio session. Skinner played on the Fried album and was Cope's main collaborator on the 4 albums subsequently released on Island Records. Skinner was a mainstay in Cope's touring band throughout this period. For the Peggy Suicide and Jehovahkill albums Skinner switched to bass and keys (whilst Cope played lead guitar) and he is also credited as co-producer. Both of these albums are regarded as high points in the singer's solo career. A disagreement between Cope and the guitarist meant that the 1994 album Autogeddon was the last time they collaborated on record (although Skinner is credited on the 20 Mothers album). Skinner returned to play on two further tours with Cope, first with the pair backed by a drum machine in 2000 and in a full band line up in 2004. Post-Cope career In 1996 Skinner contributed soundtrack music to manga series Mad Bull 34 and The Legend of the Four Kings. During 2000 Skinner played live in the band Fiji with Jamie Hince (Scarfo/The Kills).

One important risk to individuals who are spending down savings is that they will live longer than expected and thus exhaust their savings, dying in poverty or burdening relatives. This is also referred to as \\"outliving one's savings\\" or \\"outliving one's assets\\".  Individuals  Individuals often underestimate longevity risk. In the United States, most retirees do not expect to live past 85, but this is in fact the median conditional life expectancy for men at 65 (half of 65-year-old men will live to 85 or older, and more women will).  Low interest rates and declining returns exacerbating longevity risk  The collapse in returns on government bonds is taking place against the backdrop of a protracted fall in returns for other core assets such as blue chip stocks, and, more importantly, a silent demographic shock. Factoring in the corresponding longevity risk, pension premiums could be raised significantly while disposable incomes stagnate and employees work longer years before retiring.

Description Stannon takes its name from the nearby farm and is sited between two streams on the gentle slopes of Dinnever Hill, two and a half miles southeast of Camelford. It is overlooked on one side by a massive china clay works that now blights the landscape. The circle's remoteness is part of its charm with only the wild animals of the moor likely to be encountered. Stannon stone circle is a fine example of a Cornish ring and contains 47 upright stones, 30 recumbent and 2 displaced regularly spaced within an impressive by metre circle with four outlying, jagged stones. The stones average size is around with the largest stone in the group having a base width of over . Like Fernacre, Stannon is an example of Alexander Thom's Type A flattened circle, being noticeably flattened on the north side. The circle dates from either the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age. Aubrey Burl and contended that they may be earlier in date than other circles in the southern area of the moors such as the Stripple stones. John Barnatt suggested this dating and surveyed the site. Archaeology Excavations in the area of Stannon Down were carried out by R. J. Mercer in the late 1960s. He was able to study eight unenclosed round house sites that were suggested to be a settlement of over twenty, approximately to metres in diameter covering an area of approximately x with fields for farming along with rectangular enclosures tentatively identified as corrals or used for stock control and have shown that the area would have been close to mixed oak woodlands and oaks would have grown in the area that would probably have been cleared in the first phases of settlement. Houses were constructed of posts, supporting thatched roofs, partitioned with wood with paved or compressed earth floors, incorporating drainage and furniture. Pottery, flint tools were discovered along with a whetstone that suggested the possibility of metal blades. The settlement was estimated to have a population of around one hundred people and dated to the Middle Bronze Age, a later date than suggested for the circle itself. Alignments When standing in the supposed centre of Stannon Circle, a point between twenty-two and twenty-eight degrees north from east is marked by Rough Tor. Matthew Gregory Lewis found a relation of these monuments to the neighbouring hills which indicated that they were designed with special consideration of the position of the sunrise at certain times of year. Andy M. Jones reviews studies of the area and called Stannon a Ceremonial Complex. Literature  * Mercer, R.

Originally intended to treat the criminally insane, the hospital eventually took in patients with a wide variety of problems, including mild to severe mental disabilities, epilepsy, depression, alcoholism and senility. The hospital campus, much of which now houses other state offices, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Partly as a replacement for this facility, the state currently operates the 25 bed Vermont psychiatric care hospital in Berlin, VT. History During the tenure of Dr. Eugene A. Stanley as superintendent (1918‚Äì1936), the hospital expanded - with a patient population peaking at 1,728 in the mid-1930s - and constructed a new three- story building specifically for the treatment of women. Stanley, who was an advocate of eugenics, espoused forced sterilization and advised the Eugenics Society, to whom he provided patient records.\\"Vermont State Hospital\\" on the Asylum Project website The word, \\"Waterbury,\\" used in a derogatory sense, was intended to convey to the listener that someone was either insane or was acting or talking in a manner disagreeable to the speaker (e.g. \\"Keep that up, and we'll be sending you to Waterbury.\\") The property was flooded in 1927. In 2011, Tropical Storm Irene flooded the property above predicted 100-year level. In 1963, the population started to decline. Empty floor space was converted into state offices.

Geography Nine-Mile Island is situated within Pool 12 of the Upper Mississippi River, between Locks and Dams Nos. 11 and 12. The head (northwestern end) of the island is at UMR river mile 574.3, with the southeastern end at mile 571.5. It is about 2 miles long and .5 mile at its widest point, with a total area of 454 acres. The island is immediately downriver from Frentress Lake, site of a popular marina in East Dubuque, Illinois and the former dock of the Silver Eagle Casino. It is adjacent to the unincorporated community of Massey, Iowa, which houses marina facilities. The island is bordered on the southwest by Molo Slough and on the northeast by the USACE's nine-foot navigation channel. Since it is on the Mississippi River, Nine-Mile Island is on the extreme eastern side of Iowa, adjacent to its border with Illinois. The USACE also maintains two aids to navigation on the island: Nine-Mile Island Daybeacon at UMR river mile 573.5, and Nine-Mile Island Light at mile 571.5, both on the right descending bank. History The island's name comes from the fact that its head is located nine river miles below Eagle Point (). It was also historically known as Shinkles Island, as evidenced by the Army Corps' Shinkles Island Bar Daybeacon at UMR mile 574.1 on the left descending bank (Illinois side of the river). The island was also the site of a steamboat race in 1885 between the DAN THAYER and CLYDE. Conservation Nine-Mile Island is densely forested, save for a sandy beach at the head of the island which is popular with vacationers. The area is characterized by numerous sloughs and backwaters, and the island surrounds Horseshoe Lake and Green Lake. Classified as public land, the island is part of both the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge and the Driftless Area National Wildlife Refuge. Prior to the construction of dams on the Upper Mississippi, thousands of wingdams regulated the flow of the river. Multiple remnants of these common structures are still present near the island. There is also a 1/2-mile revetment on the north side of the island and a 1/4-mile revetment on the southeastern end. Recreation Since the island is just southeast of the Dubuque metropolitan area, it is a popular destination for boaters and picnickers. There are no roads on the island. Boats must be careful not to drop anchor at the head of the island, since there is an underground natural gas pipeline buried there, formerly owned by Enron Gas Pipeline Co.

ISSN 1368-485X Design and development The first Pioneer began as an aircraft construction project of Walt MacFarlane in 1965, but he did not complete the aircraft. The partially completed project was purchased by Bill Daniels and Jim Marske in 1967, who completed it and first flew the aircraft in 1968. That prototype, serial number 1, registered N7910 was still registered to Daniels in 2011. In its original configuration the Pioneer had a wingspan. The aircraft was constructed with a wood and doped fabric wing, with the fuselage made from steel tube and fiberglass. The design features a fixed monowheel landing gear, flaps for glide-path control and spoilers for roll control instead of the more usual ailerons. The original Pioneer was modified with wing extensions, bringing the span to and it was re-designated the Pioneer IA. In this configuration the aircraft can fly as slowly as or as fast as . The original design was simplified for homebuilt construction, retaining the wood and fabric wing construction, but the fuselage was changed to a fiberglass structure. The wingspan was shortened to to allow the wings to be built in a standard deep garage. Unlike on the original design, roll control was changed to ailerons, with upper surface spoilers paired with lower surface dive brakes for glidepath control. Because the aircraft is tailless the centre of gravity range is very narrow. To simplify weight and balance considerations the monowheel landing gear is located on the desired C of G and the pilot's seat is adjustable fore-and-aft. The pilot simply moves the seat until the aircraft balances on the wheel to ensure that the balance is within the center-of- gravity range. The empty weight is with a gross weight of .

Reported building times range from 600 to 2000 hours. At least one Pioneer II was modified with a wingspan. Marske has built a prototype Pioneer III, an all-composite variant of the basic design. The Pioneer III is intended to be lighter than the Pioneer II, produce a 20% drag reduction and be optimized for flight in weak lift conditions.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description Reverend William Kelly founded the parish as St. John the Baptist in 1867 and erected a frame church. Ten years later, a brick structure replaced it. After Pope Leo XIII established the Diocese of Cheyenne in 1887 the church was rededicated to St. Mary. The congregation outgrew the brick church and Bishop James J. Keane, third bishop of Cheyenne, started plans to build a new cathedral and bishop's residence. Construction of the new cathedral began in 1906. The architectural firm of Fisher and Lowery from Omaha designed the building. Bishop Keane and the Reverend James A. Duffy acquired the necessary funds and a site for construction. An estimated 5,000 people attended the laying of the cornerstone on Sunday, July 7, 1907. Prominent Wyoming builder Moses Patrick Keefe was responsible for constructing the cathedral. The sandstone for the exterior was quarried at Iron Mountain, north of Cheyenne. On January 31, 1909, Bishop Maurice Burke of St. Joseph, Missouri, who had been the first bishop of Cheyenne, consecrated the cathedral. Bishop John Carroll of Helena, Montana delivered the sermon. The cathedral is in the Gothic Revival style and features two side galleries and a rear organ loft. The ceiling is supported by steel and concrete arches faced with oak. The total construction costs equaled $125,000, and the building was debt-free when completed. The stained glass windows are donated memorials crafted in Europe. The large Madonna window in the organ loft was a gift of the Knights of Columbus. Parish records do not contain information about the artists or installation dates. In 1962, the parish added a structure east of the cathedral to house meeting and activity rooms at a cost of $200,000. The Visser-Rowland Organ Company constructed its Opus 92 for the cathedral in 1991. The instrument features 38 stops and 53 ranks and was dedicated in March, 1992.

After their eviction and detention, the nuns and monks are not permitted to join monastic centers. The monastic and layperson community at Larung Gar might have been larger, but its population also declined due to the demolition of housing by Chinese authorities.

As of 2018, the road to Yarchen Gar has been paved and the complex has built amenities for visitors, including a restaurant and at least two hotels, but the number of beds sometimes falls short during summer when many tourists visit. At times, foreign visitors have reported harassment and/or being forced to leave. As of late 2018, a police checkpoint at the entrance to the settlement was checking the identification of all visitors but was not preventing them from entering. Men are not allowed to enter the nuns' area on the west side of the river, which separates the female and male practitioners.

Since people across cultures tend to hold different implicit beliefs, schemas and stereotypes, it would seem only natural that their underlying beliefs in what makes a good leader differ across cultures. = Hofstede‚Äôs Cultural Dimensions = One of the most prominent and influential studies to date regarding leadership in a globalized world is the Hofstede dimensions of culture. The study reveals similarities as well as differences across cultures and emphasizes the need to be open-minded to understand the differences in other cultures. Hofstede utilizes six dimensions of culture to compare cultures to give leaders an understanding of how to adjust their leadership styles accordingly. These dimensions include individualism/collectivism, feminine/masculine, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, long-term/short- term orientation, and indulgence/restraint. = GLOBE = The Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness Research Project (GLOBE) study incorporated both the ILT and Hofstede's dimensions into one unique research study. The GLOBE study extended the ILT to include individuals of a common culture maintaining a relatively stable common belief about leaders, which varies from culture to culture. They labeled this the Culturally Endorsed Implicit Leadership Theory (CLT). The GLOBE study came up with the nine dimensions of uncertainty avoidance, power distance, collectivism I: societal collectivism, collectivism II: in-group collectivism, gender egalitarianism, assertiveness, future orientation, performance orientation and humane orientation. Some of those dimensions correlate with the respective dimension from Hofstede. However, they differ since the GLOBE dimensions distinguish between cultural values and cultural practices, as opposed to Hofstede. = Leadership styles =  Paternalistic leadership  Paternalistic leadership ‚Äúcombines strong discipline and authority with fatherly benevolence and moral integrity couched in a ‚Äòpersonalistic‚Äô atmosphere‚Äù. Paternalistic leadership is composed of three main elements: authoritarianism, benevolence, and moral leadership. At its roots, paternalistic leadership refers to a hierarchical relationship in which the leader takes personal interest in the workers‚Äô professional and personal lives in a manner resembling a parent, and expects loyalty and respect in return. These leaders want to transform a team into a family-like group. They would like to know employees' quality of the life overall such as hobbies, parents' health condition, and children's education. A great deal of research has been conducted on the prevalence of this leadership style in non-Western business organizations, indicating the prevalence of paternalistic leadership in countries like mainland China and Taiwan. However, considerably less research has been done on whether paternalistic leadership exists in Western cultures. Recently, there has been an increase in the amount of attention placed on paternalistic leadership in non-Western cultures. Although it is a relatively new area of focus in leadership research, evidence has been found supporting the relationship between paternalism and positive work attitudes in numerous cultures, including those of the Middle East, Latin America, and Pacific Asia. Paternalistic leadership has been found to be positively associated with job satisfaction in India but not in the United States. In both countries, paternalistic leadership was positively related to leader-member exchange and organizational commitment.  Transformational & transactional leadership  Transformational leadership is loosely defined as a charismatic leadership style that rallies subordinates around a common goal with enthusiasm and support. Transactional leadership is characterized by a give- and-take relationship using rewards as an incentive. In a 2004 questionnaire study of employees at 10 different banks, responses indicated that only 3 of the 7 factors that were found in the ideal leadership style in Egypt corresponded with the US factors. The other 4 were unique to Egypt or perhaps the Middle East in general. These results indicate an inability to assume that transactional and transformational leadership will succeed in non-western cultures. In a study of transactional and transformational leadership in China and Australia, transformational leadership predicted performance and trust in the Australian population, but only predicted trust, not performance, in the Chinese population. Transactional leadership did not predict trust or performance in either population. Other findings, however, saw a strong presence of transformational and/or transactional leadership in China, India, Kenya, and the U.S. Allocentrists, similar to collectivists, respond more positively to transformational leadership because they unite individuals around a common goal. Idiocentrists (individuals found in individualistic cultures) are more amenable to transactional leaders who reward individuals for hard work and success and less amenable to leaders who encourage group work and reduce individual identity. =Effects of cultural values in management= Differences in performance of management functions (Planning, Organizing, Commanding, Coordinating, controlling) across countries arise from different value orientations. Time focus Different cultures have different perceptions of time according to their environment, history, traditions and general practices. * Monochronic - Planning is task-oriented; Organizing is structured, linear and task-focused; Commanding - put emphasis on making and following plans, managing the inflow and distribution of detailed information; Coordinating is focused on the shorter term, meets immediate needs and requirements; Controlling use control systems that depend on detailed information and involve strict deadlines. * Polychronic - Planning is people-oriented; Organising is less structured, more holistic in nature and people-focused; Commanding - flexible, react to changing circumstances, give priority to people over plans, relies on sharing knowledge and information; Coordinating - is focused on the longer term, with concern for building relationships over time; Controlling use more flexible control systems involving people in addition to information. Time orientation * Past orientation - Planning put emphasis on continuing traditions; Organizing decisions are made within the context of the customs of the society, past goals and precedents guide the process of organizing; Commanding - develop vision and mission statements with emphasis on company's values and reputation; Coordinating - involves slower adapting of the criteria by which the management select and train employees; Controlling develop performance objectives in keeping with customary goals. * Future orientation - Planning put emphasis on long-term plans and long-term results; Organizing - work and resources are divided and co-ordinated to meet long-range goals and projections for the future ; Commanding - develop vision and mission statements with focus on achieving long-term benefits; Coordinating involves selecting and training employees to meet long-term business goals; Controlling develop performance objectives in the context of long-term goals. Power * Hierarchy - Planning - autocratic; Organization structure is tightly controlled, authority and responsibility are centralized; Commanding - employees are closely supervised and feel comfortable with a directive supervisor; Coordinating - subordinates expect bosses to take initiative to train, develop and promote them; Controlling - personal control preferred over impersonal control systems. * Equality - Planning - participative planning; Organizational structure encourages individual autonomy, authority is decentralized to lowest possible level; Commanding - participative or consultative management style, employees are not afraid to disagree with their managers; Coordinating - work relationships are not strictly prescribedin terms of behaviours and roles; Controlling - subordinates work with bosses to develop, implement, monitor and alter performance objectives. Competitiveness * Competitive - Planning - emphasis on speed and task performance; Organization structure individual achievement is encouraged in organizing the work, managers have more of leadership role; Commanding - leader's role is to track and reward achievement, higher stress in working process; Coordinating - employees are selected on their ability to work independently; Controlling - performance-based systems. * Co-operative - Planning - emphasis on maintaining relationships in plan implementation; Organization structure group integration, positive working environment, convenient schedules, managers have facilitating role; Commanding - leader's role is facilitate mutually beneficial relationships; Coordinating - employees are selected on their ability to work well in group; Controlling - task performance and team effectiveness. Activity * Doing cultures - Planning - developing measurable, time-framed action steps; Organizing involves action-oriented documentation for project management with clearly spelled out tasks; Commanding - managers are effective if they have the necessary expertise and competence; Coordinating - employees are chosen on their ability to carry out organizational tasks; Controlling - estimates task performance and the way how it was done. * Being cultures - Planning - strong focus on the vision or ideal a company wishes to attain; Organizing more focused on common vision and personal trust; Commanding - managers are effective if their personal philosophy, values and style are seen are compatible; Coordinating - career development is based not only on performance but also on personal and social criteria; Controlling - estimates effectiveness and adaptability. Space * Private - Planning - usage of individualistic or systematic forms of planning; Organizing approaches are centred on tasks; Commanding - managers and employees do not share the same office; Coordinating - explicit information about how staff should be employed; Controlling - managers use explicit measures of performance. * Public - Planning - usage of group-oriented or authoritative forms of planning; Organizing approaches are centred on relationships; Commanding - location and size of office where employee works does not reflect that person's rank in the company; Coordinating - implicit information about how staff should be employed; Controlling - managers use explicit measures of performance. Communication * Low-context - Planning - explicit, detailed, quantifiable and information-based; Organizing - task-responsibility guidelines are explicit; Commanding - managers get work done through others by outlining specific goals and ways to achieve them, explicit communication and depersonalized conflict; Coordinating - detailed contracts of employment and explicit performance appraisals; Controlling -task driven control in accordance with monitoring and control procedures used to ensure performance objectives. * High-context - Planning - implicit, less detailed in terms of instructions; Organizing - job descriptions and responsibilities are implicit and understood according to the context; Commanding - managers get work done through others by giving attention to relationships and group processes, conflicts must be resolved before work can progress; Coordinating - criteria, methods for recruitment, selection, appraisal process and firing are not explicit; Controlling -process-driven. Structure * Individualism - Planning - those, that involved in planning will take initiative to present their views; Organizational structure emphasize the individual in tasks assignments and resources allocation; Commanding - leaders expect employees to meet or exceed their responsibilities and defend their own interests; Coordinating - organizations are not expected to look after their employees' career development; Controlling tends to be exerted by individual standards of excellence, fear of losing self-respect discourages deviance from standards. * Collectivism - Planning - plans are developed within the shared values used for measuring and justifying activities in the organization; Organizational structure emphasize the group, the team is assigned tasks and resources; Commanding - leaders expect loyalty in exchange for protection, group or top- down decisions are the norm; Coordinating - promotion is based primarily on seniority, managers are evaluated according to how well they conform to organizational or group norms; Controlling deviation from standards and expectations is discouraged through group-oriented pressure.  Definitions  = Organizational leadership and culture = In the leadership literature, there is a lack of consensus over how to define and refer to cross-cultural leadership. In the GLOBE study, researchers don't specifically define cross- cultural leadership; rather they outline it in two components; organizational leadership and culture. The authors describe organizational leadership as ‚Äúthe ability of an individual to influence, motivate, and enable others to contribute toward the effectiveness and success of the organizations of which they are members‚Äù. The authors note that there is no universal definition for culture, but GLOBE's definition includes ‚Äúshared motives, values, beliefs, identities, and interpretations or meanings of significant events that result from common experiences of members of collectives and are transmitted across age generations‚Äù. = International executive = Another term for a cross- cultural leader is \\"international executive\\", defined as ‚Äúan executive who is in a job with some international scope, whether in an expatriate assignment or in a job dealing with international issues more generally‚Äù. = Global Leadership = Global leadership has been defined as ‚Äúa process of influencing the thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors of a global community to work together synergistically toward a common vision and common goals‚Äù. Six core dimensions of competencies of a global leader have been identified: cross-cultural relationship skills, traits and values, cognitive orientation, global business expertise, global organizing expertise, and visioning.  Operationalizations  In researching the international executive, Spreitzer et al. (1997) found that general intelligence, business knowledge, interpersonal skills, commitment, courage and ease in dealing with cross-cultural issues are traits that resonate throughout the literature in illustrating a successful international executive. They indicated a lack of academic research predictors of ‚Äúinternational executive‚Äù success, but agree that open personality, flexibility, drive and language skills all contribute to a successful international executive. Rather than delineating a term for the leader, Rentsch, Mot, and Abbe (2009) describe a specific trait that is attributed to multicultural leadership known as multicultural perspective-taking: the ability of such leaders to ‚Äútake the perspective of another within the cultural context, to apply cultural lenses, and to adapt quickly when encountering individuals or groups from unfamiliar cultures‚Äù. Cross-cultural organizational behavior refers to the overall behaviors that a cross-cultural leader should embody; that is, ‚Äúcross-cultural similarities and differences in processes and behaviors at work, and the dynamics of cross-cultural interfaces in multicultural domestic and international contexts‚Äù. In international business, cross-cultural competence refers to ‚Äúan individual‚Äôs effectiveness in drawing upon a set of knowledge, skills, and personal attributes in order to work successfully with people from different national cultural backgrounds at home or abroad‚Äù. The focus here is not on acquiring knowledge, but rather on how the individual uses knowledge they already have acquired. In a similar study conducted by Abbe, et al. (2007), this same concept of cross-cultural competence (here referred to as 3C), was found to enable leaders to interact in any culture, as opposed to language and regional knowledge, which only work in specific cultures. 3C is dynamic and subject to develop over time. The authors established three components of cross-cultural competence, which include knowledge and cognition, cultural awareness, cross-cultural schema, and cognitive complexity. Abbe et al. (2007) found that a leader will be successful working in another culture if personal, work, and interpersonal domains are met.  Implications for practice  Implications of this need for cross-cultural leaders can be seen in the human resource departments within these global organizations. There is a strong agreement across the literature that the selection process plays a key role in hiring the people who will be most effective cross-cultural leaders. The articles detail specific personality traits and individual differences that promote quality cross- cultural leadership for multicultural settings. They also all emphasize across the board the need to hire individuals who already have prior extensive international experience, beyond vacationing in a given country. Additionally, there have been many studies published regarding the effect of intercultural training on expatriate success. While some disagree and question the effectiveness of training, most authors indicate that there is some, if only minor, success factor in intercultural training. There is no disagreement about the need for intercultural sensitivities and communication skills; it is the process of attaining these skills that is in question. Spreitzer, McCall Jr., Mahoney (1997) believe that executives attain these skills through continuous learning, and an array of differentiated projects and experiences which all lead to an accumulated knowledge. Mintzberg and Gosling (2002) agree that executives learn through experience and note that they get to their level because of those experiences. They add that it would be detrimental to the executives to remove them from their experiential learning to sit them in a classroom and instead encourage a learning technique that incorporates classroom learning during short breaks from their job, roughly two weeks of every sixteen months. Hechanova et al. (2003) add that in effective cross- cultural training that is provided by many organizations is actually more detrimental than none at all. According to Kealey and Protheroe (1996), the three most important ingredients to successful work overseas include the aptitudes and motivations of the expatriate and his immediate family, the aptitudes and motivation of the local counterparts and the overall organization of the project. Therefore, while training is important, only a piece of one of the three aspects, expatriate's personal aptitudes, can be altered by training.  Notes  32. Kumaresan, Venkat (2019).

Used mainly as an office building in later years, it had a Category II heritage listing by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. It was demolished in March 2011, having suffered significant damage in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake and more damage in the subsequent February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. History The site of the building, on the corner of Hereford and Montreal Streets, was occupied by the St Elmo Boarding House. It was advertised as \\"superior private accommodation\\". A replacement building, St Elmo Courts, was designed in 1929 by B. J. Ager. This reflected a movement in the larger New Zealand cities in the 1920s and 1930s for apartment living. The appeals were inexpensive living in a central location, with apartments offering modern conveniences and built in furniture. St Elmo Courts was constructed in 1930. Accordingly, St Elmo Court provided bedsits and two-bedroom apartments. Many of those were later converted to office space. After the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, the building was yellow stickered (meaning restricted access only). The building's owner and his insurance company agreed that it was too damaged after the 22 February 2011 earthquake for it to be saved. Demolition began on 20 March 2011. Structural design and failure mechanism Demolition of St Elmo Courts in March 2011. Shear failure detail. St Elmo Court had a light reinforced concrete frame that was infilled with masonry. Following the 4 September 2010 earthquake, diagonal shear cracks were visible in the fa√ßade in the vertical piers. One column had a shear failure. The damage became more extensive in the 22 February 2011 earthquake. Rebuild A modern, 5-storey replacement has been constructed on the Hereford Street site. The new building is to 180% of the new building code, and features base isolators. Law firm Wynn Williams has taken naming rights and the building is now called Wynn Williams House. Heritage listing On 26 November 1981, the building was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category II historic place, with the registration number being 3133.

The building is a single-unit mosque composed of a square hall crowned with a dome, which is in diameter. The drum of the dome of the mosque is dodecagonal and adorned with a band of triangular planes on the interior. The mosque consists of a triple layer of brick with alternating layers of individually cut stone separated by vertically laid brick.Ottomans,Andrew Petersen, Dictionary of Islamic Architecture, (Routledge, 1996), 217. In 1939 the three-bay portico preceding the hall to the west was demolished, to make space for road expansion. The portico, was roofed with a barrel vault to the south and a mirror vault on the north. In the place of the demolished portico, a new enclosed portico was added to the northern side of the building in the year 1959. The mosque never had a minaret. The ornamental details of the interior have been lost under the layers of plaster. For the construction of the mosque, brick and rubble stone, was used, together with saw-toothed brick cornices at the top of the walls and terra-cotta tileswere used on the brick dome.

He also held several other positions throughout his career, serving as an executive officer of the New York City Civil Service Commission in 1902, secretary of the New York Civil Service Reform League (1894-1902), executive manager of The New York Times (1916-1921), and president of the Regional Plan Association (1930-1940). Biography McAneny was born on Christmas Eve, 1869, in Greenville, New Jersey, graduated from Jersey City High School (since renamed as William L. Dickinson High School) and then reported for The New York World, supporting civil service, city planning and a Bureau of Municipal Research. At different times later in his career he was executive secretary of the New York Civil Service Commission and secretary of the New York Civil Service Reform League (1894‚Äì1902). While president of the City Club of New York from 1906 to 1909, he served on the city's charter review commission (1908). He was elected on fusion tickets as Manhattan Borough President in 1909 and as President of the New York City Board of Aldermen in 1913, serving from that position for several months as acting mayor in place of John Purroy Mitchel. With Booker Washington and other dignitaries From 1916 to 1921 he was the executive manager of The New York Times and from 1921 to 1926, he chaired the New York State Transit Commission. In 1933, he served briefly as New York City Comptroller before becoming President of the Title Guarantee and Trust Company (1934‚Äì1936). After 1920, McAneny was active in several other fields of interest, including city and regional planning (as the first President of the Regional Plan Association from 1930 to 1942), sanitation (at one point as the City's Commissioner of Sanitation), landmarks preservation (as president of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society from 1942 to 1950), and preparing the 1939 New York World's Fair as chairman of the World's Fair Commission from 1935 to 1936.Jessica Marati (2008), , articles on \\"Comptroller\\" (page 270) and \\"George McAneny\\" (by Richard Skolnick, page 703).\\"George McAneny\\" in the New York Preservation Archive Project, retrieved March 5, 2012 He died in Princeton, New Jersey on July 29, 1953.  Accomplishments  In 1911, McAneny became the chairman of a new transit committee of the Board of Estimate. He and the other members worked out a complex compromise with the state Public Service Commission, which had to authorize the franchises, and the railroad companies. Several lines would run through the densest part of Manhattan's core, where high ridership was assured, but they would link to a dozen new and expanded lines running to less developed areas of the outer boroughs. Control of the new lines would be split, and in some cases shared, between the IRT (Interborough Rapid Transit Company) and the BRT (Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, later reconstructed into the BMT or Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation). This arrangement, which became known as the Dual Contracts, was approved by the New York Public Service Commission in 1913, while McAneny and his fellow Fusionists were preparing to run for re-election. Over the succeeding years, this plan would result in the extension of subway lines to far-flung areas of the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens, making land accessible for lower-density development that would help disperse the congested population of the inner city.Starks, Charles. New York's Pioneer of Planning and Preservation: How George McAneny Reshaped Manhattan and Inspired a Movement.

McAneny was the driving force behind the city's 1916 comprehensive zoning resolution, which for the first time provided residential neighborhoods with the possibility of legal protection against land-use change. He supported the Fifth Avenue Association, a business group that advocated for zoning to stabilize land values, and created the committees of the Board of Estimate that would develop the resolution.Gilmartin, Shaping the City, 181‚Äì202. Edward M. Bassett, who served on one of McAneny's committees and later became one of the nation's foremost zoning experts, called McAneny the \\"father of zoning in this country.\\"Edward Bassett to George McAneny, December 30, 1919, Box 54, George McAneny Papers, Princeton University. McAneny and reformers with the most comprehensive view of city planning advanced regulatory schemes that would limit the height and bulk of buildings, occasionally going so far as to propose architectural review of exterior facades. They promoted a concept known as excess condemnation, which would have allowed the city to capitalize on its own infrastructure investments by acquiring more land than needed for new streets and subways and in order to consolidate small parcels and sell them for redevelopment at higher values. Even more sweepingly, they sought to decongest the tenement districts and promote the development of suburban housing for the masses by building rapid- transit lines into heretofore rural areas of the outer boroughs, where private developers would build new, more salubrious housing for workers. As Manhattan Borough President, George McAneny helped secure funding from the philanthropist Olivia Slocum Sage for the restoration of New York's historic City Hall, built in 1811. He also brokered a plan that prevented City Hall from being overshadowed by a massive new courthouse in City Hall Park. Due to McAneny's efforts, the new building was eventually constructed several blocks north instead.\\"Conference To-Day on Court House Site,\\" The New York Times, October 13, 1911; \\"Court House Site Is Now Determined,\\" The New York Times, January 19, 1912; Randall Mason, The Once and Future New York: Historic Preservation and the Modern City (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2009), 157‚Äì64. In addition to protecting views of City Hall, McAneny's plan inadvertently saved the now-landmarked Tweed Courthouse, which would have been demolished under the original proposal. Also during his time in office as the Manhattan Borough President McAneny spearheaded a street widening project. Unlike earlier street widening campaigns that had used eminent domain to claim property, the widenings of 1909 to 1912 mostly did not seek to condemn private property and enlarge the rights-of-way of the avenues. Instead, the method was to widen the roadways within the existing rights-of-way by reallocating space from the sidewalk to the roadway and, where possible, to compensate for some of the lost sidewalk by removing structures and architectural projections from the remaining sidewalk area. McAneny spearheaded a plan to extend Seventh Avenue south through Greenwich Village and connect it with Varick Street, which would itself be widened. The Seventh Avenue extension alone destroyed over 250 historic buildings in the West Village.\\"Landmarks Doomed for New Avenue,\\" The New York Times, October 5, 1913. The Varick Street widening threatened St. John's Chapel, a beloved city landmark dating to 1822. (Trinity Church, which owned the chapel, had wanted to raze it for years in spite of community opposition, and the widening provided a convenient excuse to do so).Mason, The Once and Future New York, 73‚Äì101. When preservationists raised an outcry, McAneny tasked his newly formed Committee on the City Plan with negotiating a solution that would allocate city funds to shore up the chapel and turn it over to a community group.\\"Report of the Committee on St. John's Chapel,\\" December 15, 1914, I.N. Phelps Stokes Papers, New-York Historical Society; I.N. Phelps Stokes to Joseph H. Hunt, March 17, 1915, I.N. Phelps Stokes Papers, New-York Historical Society. Unfortunately, McAneny left office before the compromise was executed, and in 1918 Trinity demolished the chapel, which was replaced with a modern post office.Gilmartin, Shaping the City, 337‚Äì38; \\"Post Office for St. John's Site,\\" The New York Times, October 8, 1920. In 1939, McAneny helped convince the Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes, to designate an 1830s neoclassical building that stood on the site where George Washington had been inaugurated as president in 1789, as a national historic shrine. It was the first historic building in a major city to be so designated under the 1935 Historic Sites Act.Charles Bridgham Hosmer, Preservation Comes of Age: From Williamsburg to the National Trust, 1926-1949, vol. 1 (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1981), 712‚Äì13. On the sesquicentennial of the Washington's inauguration, McAneny personally announced the designation from the steps of Federal Hall National Memorial.\\"Address of George McAneny at the Celebration of the One Hundred and Fiftieth Anniversary of the Establishment of the Government and the Inauguration of George Washington as President,\\" April 30, 1939, Box 2, Folder 9, Federal Hall Memorial Associates Administrative Records. He then became chairman of the Federal Hall Memorial Associates, a group that operated a historical museum in the building. McAneny successfully faced down Robert Moses in two related preservation battles. As president of the Regional Plan Association, he forcefully advocated against the construction of one of Moses's pet projects, a gigantic Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Bridge from the toe of Manhattan to Brooklyn that would have overshadowed Battery Park and blocked views of New York Harbor. Due to the persistence of McAneny and his colleagues, the federal government refused to allow the bridge and the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel was built instead. The outcome enraged Moses, who had called McAneny \\"an extinct volcano\\" and \\"an exhumed mummy\\" in a public hearing on the bridge plan. Moses, as Parks Commissioner, then determined to demolish the Battery's historic fort, which at the time was being used as a public aquarium, supposedly because tunnel construction would undermine its foundations, but more likely simply to take revenge against the preservationists. McAneny, who in 1942 became president of New York's main preservation society, assembled a group of leading citizens to battle Moses in the courts, in the press, and in federal, state, and local legislative bodies. Although the city government was in thrall to Moses, McAneny's group took him to court to prevent him from proceeding with the demolition. Meanwhile, drawing on his contacts in the National Park Service, with whom he had worked on Federal Hall, McAneny was able to muster federal support for saving the fort and obtained a commitment of funds from the U.S. Congress. In 1949 the city and state finally agreed to transfer the structure to the federal government, and the fort, now known as Castle Clinton, was preserved and restored as a national historic site.Charles Bridgham Hosmer, Preservation Comes of Age: From Williamsburg to the National Trust, 1926-1949, vol. 2 (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1981), 783‚Äì91; Anthony C. Wood, Preserving New York: Winning the Right to Protect a City's Landmarks (New York: Routledge, 2008), 76‚Äì82. During the Castle Clinton campaign, McAneny and his National Park Service contacts began to develop an idea for a new organization that would be able to draw on private resources to preserve historic buildings nationwide. In 1947 McAneny became the chairman of the new group, called the National Council on Historic Sites and Buildings, which, on McAneny's initiative, organized the National Trust for Historic Preservation.Hosmer, Preservation Comes of Age, 1981, 2:813‚Äì32. In the late 1940s, McAneny spoke out against plans to demolish the historic Federal-style townhouses that lined Washington Square North.Wood, Preserving New York, 86‚Äì87. His activism foretold a shift in the overall focus of the preservation movement, which by the end of the 1950s would be deeply engaged in protecting the character of the city's historic neighborhoods.  Awards  Throughout his life and civic career, George McAneny was the recipient of multiple awards and served on multiple committees, the following is a list of some of the many accomplishments which have been recognized: * 1913 - Soci√©t√© des architectes dipl√¥m√©s par le gouvernement: Medal presented in recognition in his services as laymen in the cause of architectural advancement.Journal of the American Institute of Architects, Volume 1, p. 312. * 1939 - American Institute of Architects: McAneny was awarded the first Medal of Honor for City Planning in November 1939 for distinguished contribution for the planning of the City of New York.Princeton University, George McAneny papers, Box 144, photos. * 1945 - American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society: George McAneny Medal for Outstanding Leadership in Historic Preservation.

US Department of the Interior  Legacy  McAneny's contributions to zoning in the city and the expansion of the subway system together helped shape new neighborhoods in Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. This in turn helped in avoiding the repetitive pattern of overcrowding within the older parts of the city. New York's zoning resolution of 1916 was also generally considered a paradigm in terms of city zoning and was imitated by many other cities across the United States. George McAneny's daughter, Ruth McAneny Loud, would carry on the preservation torch after his death. She became involved in the Municipal Art Society and served as its first woman president beginning in 1965.Gilmartin, Shaping the City, 379; \\"Ruth McAneny Loud, Civic Leader, Dies,\\" The New York Times, January 2, 1991.

Mission  Since the Tobacco Free Florida Campaign was founded in February 2008, The four main programmatic goals have been: * Promote cessation of tobacco use * Prevent the initiation of tobacco use among youth and adults * Eliminate secondhand smoke exposure * Reduce tobacco-related health disparities  History  Since 1989, Florida's Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services have been actively involved in the prevention of tobacco use. In 1997, Florida settled a large lawsuit with a large tobacco industry and was granted $11.3 billion to assist with Medicaid costs incurred by health care services for smokers. As a result of the lawsuit, the Tobacco Pilot Program was launched by the Florida Department of Health to help educate the youth on the impacts of tobacco use. When Florida's legislation decided to reduce funding to $1 million annually five years later after the Tobacco Pilot Program was launched, Floridians passed a constitutional amendment in 2006, which requires an annual appropriation of 15% of the gross 2005 tobacco settlement fund (adjusted for inflation) to provide money for a statewide tobacco education and prevention program. In 2007, the Zimmerman Agency was awarded $17.1 million contract to conduct a statewide social marketing, media, and public relations campaign. The Tobacco Free Florida brand was created as the department's health communication intervention component. The Tobacco Free Florida Campaign helps thousands of Floridians quit using smoke and smokeless tobacco products through the use of TV, radio, print and social media. It operates on a budget of about $65 million per year.  Campaign overview  The campaign started in 2008 was created to discourage the use of tobacco among all Floridians but with a specific emphasis on youth ages 11‚Äì17, adults ages 18‚Äì24, chronic disease sufferers, pregnant women, low-income households, parents and small businesses. Using English, Spanish and Haitian Creole media executions, the campaign is able to target all audiences through various communication channels. The Tobacco Free Florida and QuitlineFlorida Quitline commercials have become famous through the years of their existence. Tobacco Free Florida chooses to create existing high-impact spots with \\"messages that elicit strong emotions response, such as personal testimonials and strong viscerally negative content.\\" For example, a commercial that showed a brain cut in half to show the clot that has formed due to cigarette smoke. Billboards and posters are used to display images of unhealthy lungs, millions of cigarette buds collected and alarming statistics regarding tobacco use. Along with radio, commercial and social media Tobacco Free Florida has several ground work initiatives, including Smokifier Vans that travel the state visiting festivals, sporting events, and co-branded partners (YMCA and Walmart). The vans have age-progression software photo booths that ages visitors as smokers and nonsmokers allowing Floridians to experience the physical effects of smoking.  Sports partnerships  Tobacco Free Florida has successfully established partnerships with all of the following sports organizations: * Tampa Bay Rays * Tampa Bay Lightning * Florida Panthers * Miami Heat * Orlando Magic * Miami Dolphins * Florida State University * University of Florida * Bethune Cookman University * University of South Florida * University of Central Florida  Super Bowl ads  In 2010, Tobacco Free Florida purchased a package of ads for $447,992.50 to be run multiple times before, during and after the Super Bowl Game. The ads were created with a smoking cessation message intended to target adult smokers. A focus group was run on people who had seen the commercials and concluded that people did not care that they were at an increased risk of dying from cancer or heart disease but they did care that every year smoking leaves 31,000 children fatherless. The overall impact of the ad was to target adult smokers to think about their tobacco use affecting their children and family.

In 2002, he was admitted as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry. Background Derek Smyth was Head of the Laboratory of Peptide Chemistry at the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) in Mill Hill, London from 1972‚Äì1992. He had worked previously with Professor Joseph Fruton, Head of the Biochemistry Department at Yale University, where he gained experience in protein and peptide chemistry (1-3) and in 1960 transferred to Rockefeller University in New York City where in the laboratory of Stanford Moore and William Howard Stein he reinvestigated and established the definitive amino acid sequence of pancreatic ribonuclease (4-9), the first enzyme to have its primary structure determined. On moving to NIMR in 1963, Derek Smyth prepared two novel derivatives of oxytocin, N-carbamylcystine-1-oxytocin and N-carbamyl cystine-1-O-carbamyltyrosine-2-oxytocin, and in a collaborative study with Gordon Bisset it was shown that while the monocarbamyl hormone retained weak biological activity (10), the dicarbamyl derivative proved to be a specific inhibitor of oxytocin devoid of intrinsic activity (11,12), demonstrating that the action of the hormone takes place in consecutive stages that could be studied independently (13). Maintaining his interest in protein structure (14-16), Derek Smyth and Sayaki Utsumi unravelled the structure at the ‚Äòhinge region‚Äô of rabbit 7S gamma globulin, juxtaposing the FAB and (FAB)2 fragments in the 4-chain IgG molecule, locating the bridge that links the half molecules, and revealing a new oligosaccharide chain adjacent to the disulphide bridge (17-21. Present on one H-chain and not the other, the carbohydrate renders the IgG molecule asymmetric but the biological function of the carbohydrate is not known. It could serve to anchor the antibody molecule to sites where toxic glycoproteins (viruses) act. He followed this by sequencing the connecting peptide (C-peptide) of proinsulin in a range of species, indicating a conservation of secondary structure (22-25). The contribution made by the C-peptide to a 3-dimensional structure of proinsulin was proposed by Snell and Smyth (25) who constructed a model of the prohormone by aligning the secondary structure of the C-Peptide with the structure of insulin (established in the crystallographic studies of Tom Blundell and his colleagues). In the model, the C-peptide masked the ‚Äòactive site‚Äô of the insulin moiety, accounting for the inactivity of the prohormone, and the paired basic residues sites were located externally, accessible to enzymic activation. The enzymatic processing of prohormones to release their biologically active constituents was a dominant lifetime interest. His major contribution came from studies of Œ≤-lipotropin (61), now recognised as a component of the pro-opiomelanocortin locus. In a classic series of papers from 1975-1982, he and his collaborators (26-34) showed that the C-terminal fragment of lipotropin, discovered by Smyth in the pituitary (35-37), was an endogenously expressed opiate (38). Feldberg and Smyth demonstrated that this 31 amino acid peptide, now known as Œ≤-endorphin, is a neurohormone with potent analgesic activity (39-43) and profoundly significant in brain function (40, 44, 45). Subsequently Bradbury and Smyth elucidated the mechanism of peptide amidation (46-49), a post-translational modification essential for the activity of many peptide hormones and hormone releasing peptides and more recently Smyth and his colleagues isolated and identified a series of tripeptide amides with structure related to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (50-54). These peptides possess inhibitory properties and appear to fulfil a physiological role in hormone regulation. Thus pGlu Phe Pro amide which occurs in testis has been shown to inhibit the release of testosterone (51) while pGlu His Pro amide which is present in thyroid inhibits release of thyroglobulin. The continuing line of Smyth‚Äôs research culminated in the proposal of a new concept for the regulation of peptide hormone activity. In this hypothesis, increase in activity is seen to be initiated by synthesis of hormone releasing peptide in the hypothalamus but the activity of the releasing peptide is counteracted dynamically by inhibition at its target site in the periphery. That hormone activity should be sensitive to processes involving both activation and inhibition makes possible 'minute-by-minute' fine control, a key feature not present in the conventional switch on-switch off mechanism. It may be noted that the dual mechanism proposed for hormone regulation is analogous to the mechanism involved in synaptic transmission in the central nervous system, in line with a common evolutionary origin for the central and peripheral processes. After retiring from NIMR, Smyth continued his research at the Institute for Molecular Biology in Salzburg (55, 56) and in the Pharmacology Department of the University of Murcia (57-59). For several years (1977-1982) he assisted the Nobel Committee in their nomination of candidates for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and in 1997 he was elected as an honorary member (Excmo) of the Royal Academy of Medicine and Surgery in Murcia (60).

The Sign of the Kiwi, originally called Toll House, is a small caf√© and shop at Dyers Pass on the road between Christchurch and Governors Bay. It was built in 1916‚Äì17 by Harry Ell as a staging post and opened as a tearoom and rest house. It has a Category I heritage classification by Heritage New Zealand and is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. The building was closed some time after the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake and it was not until 23 January 2017, six years later, that it opened again. Although located within the burned area, the building was not damaged by the 2017 Port Hills fires a month later. Historical context Harry Ell in October 1914 Harry Ell was a Member of Parliament (1899‚Äì1919) and a Christchurch City Councillor (1903 and 1917‚Äì1919). He devoted much of his life to the conservation of bush remnants on the Port Hills on Banks Peninsula, and a key element in his scheme was to make the area accessible to the public. To that end, he proposed a Summit Road that would go along the hilltops, connecting Godley Head with the tops above Akaroa. Whilst most of the public believed that the scenic reserves to be formed were too remote, Ell had a way with landowners and organised some government funding. His usual style was to pay a deposit for land, with the remainder to be raised later. In 1909, he decided to form a Summit Road Scenic Reserve Board to help with the task of establishing his dream, but there was tension over their scope. The board wanted to have influence on policy, but Ell regarded them as a mere fund- raising body. By 1915, Ell had secured 23 reserves in the Port Hills by buying private land, and none of these projects had the board's prior approval. By the 1930s, the road had been surveyed as far south as the saddle above Pigeon Bay. Rest houses were envisaged at regular intervals. The first to be built was the Sign of the Bellbird at Kennedy's Bush in 1914. This was the location of the first scenic reserve that Ell managed to get established in 1906. The Sign of the Packhorse, a smaller house on top of the Kaituna Saddle, was the second one to be established in 1916. The Sign of the Kiwi was the third rest house built by Ell. The Sign of the Takahe was the remaining house to be built. =History= Plinth of the Sign of the Kiwi The Summit Road Scenic Reserve Board became aware in 1915 that Ell planned to build a toll house in Coronation Hill Reserve. The reserve was established in 1912 to commemorate the coronation of George V in the previous year. The board was opposed to this scheme, but Ell went ahead and the construction of the Toll House, as it was originally called, was started in 1916 with money borrowed from friends and sympathisers. The Sign of the Kiwi was opened on 9 June 1917. Ell's plan was that the collected toll would go towards funding the remainder of the Summit Road that had yet to be built. The toll gate was established in 1922 after the Heathcote County Council consented to its construction. The toll gate before the installation of the lantern. The toll gate caused considerable controversy. The dispute was over whether the toll should be compulsory. When the Main Highways Board took over the road between the Takahe and the Bellbird from the Heathcote County Council, motorists started to object. They were paying taxes for the road to be maintained, and were tolled to then use the road. The Canterbury Automobile Association lobbied on their behalf and wanted the gate totally removed. The Heathcote County Council suggested that the toll should be optional. Ell was adamant that the toll needed to be compulsory and ever using the media to his effect, he publicly declared: > I am making my will tomorrow, and am going to live in the toll house myself > ‚Äì and I am not coming out alive! ... I am going to move up there and take > the tolls myself, until they kill me. In October 1932, the Heathcote County Council instructed Ell to stop collecting tolls by the end of the month. The adjacent Halswell County Council came to the rescue, though. They saw the advantage of Ell collecting tolls for the maintenance of the Summit Road going through their area, and they suggested that the toll gate be relocated. Ell erected a new toll gate half a mile further south on Halswell County Council near Marley Hill and declared that a new toll lodge in Tudor style was to be built there. This did not happen, though, as Ell died in June 1934. At that time, the new toll gate was removed, too. A car and excursionists in front of the Sign of the Kiwi, ca 1922. The verandah of the Sign of the Kiwi, ca 1925. In 1920, Ell's wife Ada took over the running of the tea rooms in the Sign of the Kiwi. This had resulted from a conflict with the Summit Road Scenic Reserve Board. When a new chairman, businessman William Machin, took over the running of the board, he advertised in all four Christchurch newspapers that the board would not be responsible for debts incurred by Ell. Ell in turn was incensed, wrote to the Prime Minister William Massey and got the new Commissioner of Crown Lands in Christchurch to appoint him as caretaker of the Sign of the Kiwi. The board objected to this move, but Ell simply moved in. His wife taking over the running of the tea rooms saved the situation. Unlike the previous operator, she managed to make a profit every year, but suffered a nervous breakdown in 1926, which forced her to move out. World War II caused the Sign of the Kiwi to be abandoned, and the Department of Lands and Survey closed the building in the 1940s. In 1948, ownership was transferred to Christchurch City Council, which used it as a custodian's residence. Public access was restricted to the porch. Renovation for a refreshment place started in 1989, and it was opened again, acting also as an information centre. Many recreational opportunities exist in the vicinity, and the Sign of the Kiwi is popular with locals and tourists alike. The 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake damaged the shop at Sign of the Kiwi, but it took some time to recognise the seriousness of the situation and the building remained open for some time. It was stabilised to prevent further damage. A detailed engineering assessment found that it had an estimated seismic strength of just 9.5% of the building code, while the legal lower limit is 33% of code. The repair and structural upgrade, which started in October 2015, cost NZ$760,000, and the Sign of the Kiwi reopened on 23 January 2017. Whilst (just) located within the area that burned in the 2017 Port Hills fires, the building was undamaged by this event. Architecture The interior of the Sign of the Kiwi, ca 1927. The Sign of the Kiwi was designed by local architect Samuel Hurst Seager, who became an international authority on the lighting of art galleries. Seager had also designed the two earlier rest houses along the Summit Road. He had a strong interest in vernacular architecture, described as a method of construction that uses locally available resources and traditions to address local needs and circumstances. The building is in the bungalow style and unlined, which gives the building strong features on the inside. The use of local stone, the careful siting, and the low construction make the building blend in well with its surroundings. Heritage listing On 21 September 1989, the Sign of the Kiwi was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I historic place, with the registration number being 1930. It is significant in the history of the Summit Road, and part of the earliest attempt of nature conservation in New Zealand. It is an important example of Seager's vernacular architecture. The toll gate and the stone pillar outside the building are included in the heritage listing.

Some of the basic roles, responsibilities, and powers of a county administrator/manager include: *Supervision of day-to- day operations of all county departments and staff, directly and through department heads; *Oversight of hiring, firing, disciplining and suspensions of all county employees; *Preparation, monitoring, and execution of the county budget, which includes submitting each year to the council a proposed budget package with options and recommendations for its consideration and possible approval; *Main technical advisor to the council on overall governmental operations; *Public relations, such as meeting with citizens, citizen groups, businesses, and other stakeholders (the presence of a county commissioner may alter this function somewhat); *Operating the county with a professional understanding of how all county functions operate together to their best effect; *Attends all council meetings, but does not have any voting rights *Additional duties that may be assigned by the council The responsibilities may vary depending upon charter provisions and other local or state laws, rules, and regulations.

It is presented to employees of State, USAID, and civilian contractors assigned to diplomatic and consular facilities for events that lead to death or serious illness or injury. It is roughly comparable to the U.S. military's Purple Heart, but since the criteria for the award is so strict, nearly all of them are awarded posthumously. The award consists of a gold medal set and a certificate signed by the secretary of state and the president of the United States. The initial regulations limited the issuance of the Thomas Jefferson Star for Foreign Service, originally known as the Foreign Service Star, only to members of the U.S. Foreign Service personnel system who were killed or seriously injured. The rules were later changed to allow for members of other personnel systems killed while working on behalf of a foreign affairs agency. There had been controversy about the name of the award, which suggested that only diplomats serving under the Foreign Service personnel system were eligible. As a result, Secretary of State Colin Powell proposed changing the name of the award from the Foreign Service Star to simply the Thomas Jefferson Star, naming it for the Founding Father who served as the first secretary of state. The American Foreign Service Association and the Foreign Affairs Council resisted the proposal while many others strongly supported it. In the end, the words \\"Foreign Service\\" were maintained as part of the name. Eligibility Any civilian employee of any agency, including Foreign Service Nationals (appointed under Section 303 of the Foreign Service Act), non-family member U.S. citizen employees hired at post (appointed under Section 303 and appointed under Section 311 (a) of the Foreign Service Act), and U.S. citizens and foreign nationals serving under a Personal Services Contract or Personal Services Agreement (if eligibility for the award is authorized in their contracts), are eligible for the Foreign Service Star Award as long as the employee is: : (1) Under the administrative direction of State or USAID; : (2) Employed at, or assigned permanently or temporarily to an official mission abroad, or while traveling abroad on official business; and : (3) Killed or incurs a serious illness or injury which requires hospitalization or similar treatment and which results in incapacity or disability that prevents the employee from performing his or her official duties or adversely affects his or her ability to obtain medical clearance, while the employee: :: (a) Is performing official duties; :: (b) Is located on the premises of a U.S. mission abroad; or alternatively, :: (c) By reason of the individual's status as U.S. Government employee. Criteria a. Selection of award recipients will be based on: : (1) The nexus between the death, illness or injury and the act of serving abroad in an official capacity. The death, illness or injury must be linked to the official duties of the employee. This may be by reason of location at the U.S. mission, by reason of the employee's status as a U.S. Government official, or by reason of the fact that the employee is performing, or en-route to perform official duties; and : (2) The seriousness of the illness or injury. An illness or injury is \\"serious\\" if it requires hospitalization or similar treatment and results in incapacity or disability that prevents the employee from performing his other official duties or adversely affects his or her ability to obtain medical clearance. b. Examples of employees meeting the selection criteria include, but are not limited to: : (1) The United States as the target of hostile action: :: (a) Mission as target while performing official duty, hostile fire kills or wounds a U.S. civilian employee who is accompanying U.S. peacekeepers abroad; :: (b) Employee as target, but not while on official duty, a commercial airliner flying abroad is hijacked and an employee, by reason of his or her status as a U.S. Government official, is subjected to mistreatment resulting in death, injury or serious illness. : (2) Accidents occurring in a hostile environment or crisis situation: :: (a) Employee is killed or wounded by \\"friendly fire\\" launched to counter or respond to hostile action. :: (b) Employee is killed or wounded in an automobile or airplane accident caused by a hostile action or crisis situation. :: (c) Employee is killed or wounded by a land mine, trap, bomb or chemical/biological agent, even if not targeted at the employee or the United States. : (3) Natural disasters linked to service: :: (a) Employee is killed or wounded while away from the mission, but while performing official duties, e.g., an earthquake abroad causes a building to collapse, killing several employees who are negotiating an arms control treaty; or :: (b) Employee is killed or injured at the mission, e.g., a flood strikes a U.S. Embassy compound, killing and injuring dozens of employees. : (4) Nothing in this Foreign Affairs Manual shall limit the discretion of the Secretary to recommend the Foreign Service Star Award for an otherwise eligible and deserving employee. Nominating and approval procedures Nominations for the Thomas Jefferson Star for Foreign Service must be initiated by the chief of mission or by an assistant secretary, cleared by the medical director, as appropriate, and then submitted to the Department Awards Committee for review and recommendation to the secretary. The secretary shall make final recommendations to the president. Effective date The effective date for the Thomas Jefferson Star for Foreign Service shall be August 7, 1998. An employee or surviving next of kin may petition the Department Awards Committee to consider individuals who are eligible and deserving of the Thomas Jefferson Star for Foreign Service notwithstanding the fact that the illness, injury or death occurred prior to the effective date. Military use Active duty military are not eligible to receive this award.

Working with oil and using an impasto technique, he built up the surface of his canvases with thick blocks of solid colour, creating bold and dynamic portraits of remembered and imagined figures of the slate industry. He predominantly utilised a limited palette with a preference for blues, greys and purples, although exceptions include the quarrymen's brass band, their outfits rendered in bright reds and vibrant oranges. Pritchard first exhibited his slate-inspired work at an exhibition at Glynllifon, near Caernarfon in 2007 exhibiting 30 original works. At his peak he exhibited 60 pieces in June 2009 at the Oriel Ynys Mon, Anglesey. Pritchard died aged 70 in Porthmadog following a short illness.

He attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in 1918 and later joined the Royal Engineers in 1919. McCarthy made his first-class debut for the Army against Cambridge University in 1921. Six years later he played for Rangoon Gymkhana in their only first-class match, which came against the Marylebone Cricket Club. In this match he took a single wicket, that of John Parsons in the MCC first-innings. With the bat he scored 5 runs in the Gymkhana's first- innings, before being dismissed by Jack Mercer, while in their second-innings he scored 11 runs before being dismissed by Maurice Tate. Two days after the conclusion of that match, McCarthy made his final first-class appearance for Burma against the MCC. He scored top scored in their first-innings with 48. In their second-innings he scored 9 runs before being dismissed by Maurice Tate. His first-innings score is the highest score by a batsman for Burma in first- class cricket, although this feat was not difficult to achieve as this was Burma's only match with first-class status. Returning to England, McCarthy made two Minor Counties Championship appearances for Devon in 1929, later making four appearances for the county in 1931. He later served in the Second World War and was mentioned in the London Gazette on 9 September 1942 as holding the temporary rank of colonel in the Royal Engineers.

It is the seat of the Archbishop of the Metropolis of Atlanta, in the Southeastern United States. The church is known for the rich background and extravagant decoration on both the interior and exterior of the church. The original membership of the parish was 72. The current membership includes over 1200 families.  History  The Annunciation Greek Orthodox Cathedral was established in 1905. The first services were held on the second floor of a sporting goods store. Once the membership of the church started to grow, the church relocated a couple of times. Former locations include: A Presbyterian Church (1906‚Äì1928) and a former Jewish Temple (1928‚Äì1967).http://atlanta.goarch.org/index.php?pr=Parishes-GA-Atlanta Since 1968, the cathedral has been located at 2500 Clairmont Road. The current building is a giant domed cathedral with a large community center adjacent to the church, which was dedicated in 2002.  Architecture  The church was built in a typical Byzantine style. The shape of the church is round, with a giant domed roof. Inside the church, glittering mosaics decorate the walls. A noteworthy feature of the church is the mosaic on the dome. It shows Jesus Christ as the Pantocrator. There are also mosaics on the iconostasis. In addition to the mosaics, the church also has some stained glass windows above the iconostasis.

Active in the American relief effort during World War I, she was assigned the reconstruction of the French village of Vitrimont, with monies supplied by Mrs. Crocker of San Francisco; Vitrimont was the first of a number of villages restored with American aid. She and de Buyer met by chance in Vitrimont in 1916: when her car broke down, de Buyer offered his assistance; a year later they were married, in September. Her husband had been in command of the 6th Light Armoured Brigade. In 1915 he became commander of the Third Cavalry Corps (France), and a year later of the Second Army Corps (France). He retired in 1917. The wedding was attended by such notables as General P√©tain.

Van Gogh in Nuenen In November 1884 Van Gogh taught some friends from Eindhoven, a large town near Nuenen, to paint inanimate objects in oil. Van Gogh, in his enthusiasm, created a series of still life paintings of bottles, bowls and pots and other objects. Still Life with Straw Hat was painted at Nuenen during this period. He wrote that the paintings would be hard to sell, but having deemed the effort valuable he painted still life compositions throughout the winter. The painting Still-Life with Straw Hat and another painting of this period, Still-life with Earthen Pot and Clogs, are regarded by critics and writers for their technical mastery. Both are characterized by smooth, meticulous brushwork and fine shading of colors. During his two-year stay in Nuenen, he completed numerous drawings and watercolors and nearly 200 oil paintings. However, his palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones, particularly dark brown, and he showed no sign of developing the vivid coloration that distinguishes his later, best known work. When he complained that Theo was not making enough effort to sell his paintings in Paris, Theo replied that they were too dark and not in line with the current style of bright Impressionist paintings. The painting is part of the Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum collection in Otterlo, Netherlands Provenance Helene, wife of Anton Kr√∂ller, spent her life and fortune collecting Van Gogh paintings. The Kr√∂ller's art collection of the 19th and 20th century went to the Dutch state and the Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum. It may be that the arrangement was more a means of restitution for the millions of guilders paid by the Dutch state in the 1930s to maintain solvency a bank, one of Anton Kr√∂ller corporation's largest clients, and in the process shield Kr√∂ller.

The GAIN is used with both adolescents and adults in all kinds of treatment programs, including outpatient, intensive outpatient, partial hospitalization, methadone, short-term residential, long-term residential, therapeutic community, and correctional programs., Cormier, G., Jackson- Gilfort, A., Godley, S.H., Hervis, O.E., Parks, G.A., Savery, P., Triplett, E. (2008). Evidence-Based Practice for Adolescent Substance Abuse: A Primer for Providers and Families, p. 10, accessed 2011-01-11. History The GAIN was developed to respond to the needs of substance abuse treatment personnel who are faced with the demands of assessing, documenting, treating, and monitoring clients. Researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and behavioral healthcare agencies worked to design assessment tools that could produce methodical data for mapping onto the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) for diagnosis and the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Patient Placement Criteria for placement, while following The Joint Commission (TJC) [formerly the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)] for integrating assessments into treatment plans.Dennis, M.

Bloomington, IL: Chestnut Health Systems, accessed 2011-29-04. Since its inception in 1993, application of the GAIN has expanded to thousands of users at agencies across the United States, Canada and several other countries.Dennis, M.L. (2010). Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN): Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN): A Standardized Biopsychosocial Assessment Tool accessed 2011-01-11. Family of assessments * GAIN Initial (GAIN-I) ‚Äì a comprehensive standardized assessment that can be used for treatment placement and planning, outcome monitoring, economic analysis, program planning, and supporting motivational interviewing. * GAIN Monitoring 90 Days (GAIN-M90) ‚Äì a subset of the GAIN-I used for quarterly follow-up to measure changes in participants throughout their treatment. * GAIN-Q3 ‚Äì The GAIN-Q3 includes three separate versions that screen for the recency and frequency of behavior and service utilization in nine areas. Successive versions provide additional information, such as a six-item measure of life satisfaction or supplemental modules to collect information on reasons and readiness to change.Titus, J. C., Feeney, T., Smith, D. C., Rivers, T. L., Kelly, L. L., & Dennis, M. D. (2012). GAIN-Q3 3.1: Administration, clinical interpretation, and brief intervention. Normal, IL: Chestnut Health Systems, accessed 2011-29-04. * GAIN Short Screener (GAIN-SS) ‚Äì a screener, not used for diagnosis or level of care placement, that quickly identifies clients likely to have mental health disorders, issues with crime/violence, and issues with substance use. The GAIN-SS is typically self-administered. All these assessments can be used to generate reports to aid in diagnosis and treatment planning. Content The GAIN-I has sections covering background, substance use, physical health, risk behaviors and disease prevention, mental and emotional health, environment and living situation, legal, and vocational. Within these sections are questions that address problems, services, client attitudes and beliefs, and the client's desire for services. Information on symptoms, which is used for diagnosis, is collected if the behavior has occurred in the last year. Information on behaviors, which is used for treatment monitoring, is collected if the same behavior occurred within the last 90 days. The items are combined into over 100 scales Scale (social sciences) and subscales that can be used for DSM-IV‚Äìbased diagnoses,American Psychiatric Association. (2000).

As biopsychosocial assessments, The GAIN-I and GAIN-SS provide measures over four main categories of emotional and behavioral health problems‚Äîinternalizing, externalizing, substance, and crime/violence. Among these categories are numerous scales and indices, which have demonstrated good reliability and internal consistency in studies.Dennis, M.L., Chan, Y., & Funk, R. (2006). Development and validation of the GAIN Short Screener (GSS) for internalizing, externalizing and substance use disorders and crime/violence problems among adolescents and adults. The American Journal on Addictions, 15, 80‚Äì91. Response to criticism The GAIN has been criticized for not having scales to assess response style. Critics say these face-valid questions are vulnerable to faked responses from participants.Rogers, R. (2008) Clinical Assessment of Malingering and Deception. New York, NY: The Guilford Press Although it would be impossible for interviewers to ensure that participants always provide genuine responses to questions, the benefit of semi-structured assessments, like the GAIN, is that they allow the interviewer to clarify participant responses. Additionally, helping participants understand how their responses will be used in specific areas of their treatment may encourage them to be truthful. The GAIN-I includes ratings at the end of each section that allow an interviewer to record whether a participant seemed to be doing some estimating, whether they did not understand the questions, whether they were in denial about the severity of a problem or whether they were misrepresenting information. These ratings can be used as flags to communicate problem areas to clinicians and can also assist in treatment planning.Titus, J.C., Unsicker, J.I., White, M.K., Dennis, M.L., Feeney, T. (2008).

Early and personal life  H√∏ibakk was born to the engineer Rolf H√∏ibakk (1908‚Äì2002) and his wife Mary Wilthil. In 1965, H√∏ibakk married Inger Holm, but divorced her in 1998. Career H√∏ibakk grew up at Rjukan and took examen artium in 1956. After that, he studied at the Norwegian Institute of Technology until 1962. He then served his conscription at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment at Kjeller. During his conscription, he became familiar with the Manchester computer named FREDERIC, which was imported from the University of Manchester. From 1963 to 1965, H√∏ibakk worked at the SINTEF research centre in Trondheim. After he left SINTEF, H√∏ibakk was appointed managing director of the computer technology company Nor-Data, which he remained for 13 years. In 1978, he was appointed chairman of Tandberg Radio data division. In the same year the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry decided to bankrupt Tandberg Radio, which was the first time the Norwegian government had decided to bankrupt a company. H√∏ibakk decided to start a new company, Tandberg Data. It gained surplus in the first years, and in 1978 it released its first product; a table computer. In the following years, Tandberg Data produced keyboards and personal computers which were ergonomically designed. In the 1980s, Tandberg Data tried to start business in the United States, but without success. In 1986, H√∏ibakk resigned from his position in the company, and established H√∏ibakk Invest AS, where he was managing director. In 2000, he was appointed Professor II at the Narvik University College.  Mountaineering  H√∏ibakk is a noted mountaineer. In 1958, he was part of the first climbing of Trollryggen.

As a solo artist, he has released three acclaimed albums completing a trilogy of work inspired by his childhood home, as well as themes of nature , landscape and community. His work combines field recordings with classical orchestration and contemporary electronic elements. Cooper also works across mixed media projects including installation art, theatre and film. He‚Äôs a recipient of a Royal Television Society award and his music is played frequently on BBC Radio 3 & BBC Radio 6 Music as well as featured on various TV network productions. Originally founding member of bands The Magnetic North and Erland and the Carnival with whom he has released five acclaimed albums, he has a diverse musical background. Cooper was born and raised on the Scottish archipelago of Orkney and now owns a private London recording studio which has become home to some of the UK's most acclaimed left field producers, artists, and mixing engineers. He is credited with exploring the concept of psychogeography, connecting identity, memory, and place through music and cinematography. He explores these themes further by partnering with well-known artists and writers in his work and live shows. Early life Cooper was born and raised on the Scottish archipelago of Orkney. He was raised with six siblings on the islands by his parents, describing it as a remote yet creative place to grow up. He left aged 18 to travel and studying in locations like London, New York, Edinburgh and Budapest. Cooper spent years studying traditional folk music, Bert Jansch and Davey Graham, sourcing old British songs from the Vaughan Williams Museum and developing his writing skills. He is well known for his contemporary arrangements of traditional Scottish and English folk songs, resulting in a \\"wild pastiche of digital trickery and oral tradition that channels the spirit of '70s progressive rock while staying true to pop-song brevity\\". Music career =Erland and the Carnival= In 2009, Cooper co-founded the band Erland and the Carnival in London with multi-instrumentalist Simon Tong (formerly of The Verve, Blur and The Good, the Bad & the Queen) and drummer/engineer David Nock (The Orb, The Cult, The Fireman, David Gilmour, Paul McCartney). =The Magnetic North= In 2011 Cooper co-founded the British shoegaze band The Magnetic North with Simon Tong and singer, composer and orchestral arranger Hannah Peel. Formed in London, they released their debut album, Orkney: Symphony of the Magnetic North on 6 May 2012. Cooper said that the inspiration for the album came from an appearance of long dead Betty Corrigall in one of his dreams, insisting that he wrote an album about his home. This theme is currently being developed into a stage production. =Solo career= Cooper released his debut solo album Solan Goose, heavily influenced by native Orcadian birds, on 23 March 2018. The album is the first of a triptych that reflects on the natural world surrounding Orkney, with its tracks each taking their titles from Orcadian dialect words for birds. Cooper announced the release of the second album in the triptych, Sule Skerry, via Mary Anne Hobbs's BBC Radio 6 Music show on 21 February 2019, where she played the lead single, 'Haar'. The record will be released on 17 May 2019 on Phases. =Writing credits= Cooper is best known for his contemporary arrangements of traditional Scottish and English folk songs, including most notably \\"Love Is a Killing Thing\\" and \\"The Derby Ram\\" collected by Ralph Vaughan Williams but he has also written for established artists like Paul Weller.

The Edelstam Prize, named after Harald Edelstam, is awarded annually by the Harald Edelstam Foundation. The Edelstam Prize is awarded to a person who has shown outstanding contributions and courage in defense of Human Rights. The Edelstam Prize is named for the Swedish diplomat and ambassador Harald Edelstam (1913-1989). Harald Edelstam distinguished himself as diplomat by his professional competence, his bravery and his civic courage in the fight for Human Rights. He was an early proponent and symbol of what is today known as \\"Responsibility to Protect\\", and his memorable acts contributed to saving more than a thousand lives. The winner of the Edelstam Prize can be someone from the private sector or a public servant. The winner embodies Ambassador Harald Edelstam's spirit in a country/countries where Human Rights, according to international law, have been violated. The laureate demonstrates an ability to analyze and handle complex situations and to defend Human Rights. The candidate has, presumably in a complex situation, been able to take a decisive role in helping threatened people or directly saving human lives. Civic courage is a central parameter in the selection of the successful candidate.  The Jury  An international jury selects the winners from a list of nominated candidates. The jury is chaired by Harald Edelstam's granddaughter Caroline Edelstam, co- founder of the Edelstam Foundation.

Mayan communities, in spite of being the majority of the population, have been exploited, discriminated against, and victimized in their own homeland for centuries. The worst period came between 1960 and 1996: egregious abuses of human rights were perpetrated in Guatemala during the internal armed conflict. According to the CEH (UN backed Truth Commission) 200,000 civilians were murdered and 50,000 were forcibly disappeared. Most of them, 83% (93% of the abuses caused by the State), were defenseless indigenous Mayans. After the signature of the Peace Agreements, nobody was made accountable for these heinous crimes. Benjam√≠n considered that those responsible for the crimes should be brought to justice. It was not an easy task, since discrimination, threats, retaliations and violence persist in Guatemala, and the rate of violent deaths today is double that during the war. Benjam√≠n represents the voice of the victims; has courageous and tirelessly worked for decades in defense of human rights, truth and justice for the indigenous communities in his country, despite repeated threats against his life. His endeavor and commitment are an example and reminder every day to the international community than most of the perpetrators in Guatemala remain unpunished.\\"  See also  * Harald Edelstam  References  * Uruguay: Mujica firma apoyo para Premio Harald Edelstam (Spanish) *  External links  *http://www.edelstamprize.org/ Peace awards Humanitarian and service awards Courage awards ","title":"Edelstam Prize"},{"id":"31242839","text":"Santa Quit√©ria Futebol Clube, commonly known as Santa Quit√©ria, is a Brazilian football club based in Santa Quit√©ria do Maranh√£o, Maranh√£o state.

In World War II it was developed as an emergency west coast port facility, in case Liverpool or the Clyde ports were put out of commission by enemy action. Portpatrick at first Portpatrick, on the western side of the Rinns,Sometimes spelt Rhins had long served as a port for a short sea route from Donaghadee in Northern Ireland. Since 1620 the route had been used for importing cattle and horses, and for the transfer of military personnel. Later mail transit for the Post Office mails developed, by 1838 8,000 to 10,000 letters passed through the port daily, brought by coach from both Dumfries and Glasgow. However the small harbour was cramped and exposed to westerly winds. Although Government funding had been promised for improvements space for substantial expansion was limited. Also the development of more attractive alternative routes, in particular from Holyhead to Kingstown, (renamed D√∫n Laoghaire) led to a loss of commitment to Portpatrick.R R Cunningham, Portpatrick Through the Ages, Wigtown Free Press, Stranraer, 1977 Next Stranraer In 1857 the Portpatrick Railway was authorised, its primary objective being to connect Portpatrick and Carlisle for the carriage of mails, passengers and goods. When it became obvious that Portpatrick Harbour was not going to be improved, the railway concentrated on Stranraer as its ferry port. Stranraer is at the southern end of Loch Ryan; although the passage to Irish ports is longer, Stranraer was a more spacious and better-sheltered location, so it became the dominant port for transits to Northern Ireland.David L Smith, The Little Railways of South West Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969 World War II Cairnryan Military Railway system In 1940, consideration was given to the provision of a west coast port for use in the event of Liverpool or Glasgow being put out action. This was a large undertaking, planned to take up the full capacity of one of the large commercial ports. Faslane on the Gare Loch was also considered, but it was determined to develop the location that became Cairnryan on the eastern shore of Loch Ryan, some distance north of Stranraer. This involved considerable civil engineering work and 4,000 military and other personnel worked on the project. Many of the military staff were American, at that stage the USA had not entered the war and thus they wore civilian clothing. Work began on 20 January 1941.David L Smith, Legends of the Glasgow and South Western Railway in LMS Days, David and Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1980, A siding from the main line was laid in from a ground frame connection about a mile east of Stranraer Harbour Junction. The first occupants of the siding were five dormitory coaches, LMS camping coach 46059 and a canteen van, for which an ex-Highland Railway 4-4-0 LMS no 14382, Loch Moy, supplied steam heat, though minus its internal machinery. This siding expanded into a large yard of ten parallel roads, ultimately 6¬º miles long, curved round to the shore of the loch. A signalbox was erected at the junction and opened on 11 October 1942. Five groups of sidings and 47 roads were constructed, as well as a large engine shed and coaling stage. The military railway connected with the main line at Cairnryan Junction, about a mile (about 2 km) east of Stranraer, aligned to permit through running to and from the east. The final alignment of the railway after the construction phase was altered in the Stranraer area, and the main line connection was later made at Aird, somewhat nearer Stranraer. The railway was opened in July 1942, and the port itself was ready in July 1943. A timetabled passenger operation was in place, and Gill reproduces a photograph of a railway ticket, marked \\"C.& S.Railway\\" (i.e. Cairnyan and Stranraer Railway) (officially a military recreational travel permit) the return fare was 2¬Ωd. The ticket is marked \\"Passenger travels at his own risk.\\"Bill Gill, The Cairnryan Military Railway, 1941 - 1959, Stranraer and District Local History Trust, Stranraer, 1999, The preparations for the Normandy landings took the focus of activity to the south of England, and Cairnryan was for the time being reduced to a care and maintenance status. In fact only eighteen fully laden ocean-going vessels used the port.C E J Fryer, The Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Railways, Oakwood Press, Usk, 1991, =Royal visit= At the end of June 1942, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth paid a visit to Northern Ireland, and it was arranged that they would travel via the Cairnryan Military Railway and the port. The full Royal Train did not go down the CMR; a two-coach train was provided: the Caledonian Railway officers' saloon and a newly decorated first brake. Stranraer got out its best class 2P 4-4-0 locomotive no 600, and they cleaned, polished and scrubbed to perfection. Two days later their majesties returned, and 2P no 614 was borrowed from Dumfries. The royal passengers transferred to the main line train at the temporary platform at the junction.Smith, Legends, pages 166 and 117 After the war After the end of World War II, the facility was used to load superfluous ammunition, brought to the port by rail, onto army landing craft for disposal at sea - a hazardous task, which took the lives of several at the port, while the long-term and wider risks of such dumping have only later become more evident. Smith describes the railway operation on the military line: > They brought these gas shells in standard trains of 32 wagons. The WD people > worked them from Cairnryan Junction down the 5¬Ω miles of rather lumpy line > to the new port. Authority thought that 32-wagon trains were uneconomical, > so they got an Austerity 2-10-0 [locomotive] down to Cairnryan, and worked > the gas shells down from the junction in trains of 64. And the 64-wagon > train got away with them! [The wagons overpowered the braking effort of the > locomotive and brake van on the gradient.] Well, I've talked of various > exciting happenings in that neighbourhood, but I think that 64 [loaded > wagons] of poison gas behind your tender‚Äîand you can't stop‚Äîis quite enough > excitement for any normal driver for quite a time.Smith, Legends, page 39 At the end of the war, the Atlantic U-Boat fleet surrendered in Loch Ryan and was anchored in the port before being towed to the North Channel and scuttled. This activity was codenamed Operation Deadlight. After the end of any strategic objective, Ship breaking became the main industry; the great British aircraft carriers HMS Centaur, HMS Bulwark, HMS Eagle, and HMS Ark Royal were all sent there for decommissioning, as well as a number of other vessels including HMS Mohawk and HMS Blake. As recently as 1990, Soviet Navy submarines were being dismantled there for scrap. The railway and the main line connection at Cairnryan Junction remained available for use for some years, but the junction with the main line at Aird had ceased to be functional by 1960.British Railways, Sectional Appendix to the Working Timetables, etc, Glasgow, 1960 The decision was taken to remove the facility; the final rail movement was part of the dismantling process in 1967. A single pier remains, one was dismantled and another was destroyed in an ammunition explosion shortly after the war. Although the remaining pier is in a state of disrepair and fenced off to the public many anglers use it as it offers access to seafish such as mackerel, cod, dogfish, mullet and plaice. Commercial ferries In the 1970s the ferry service between Stranraer and Larne in Northern Ireland was operated by British Railways. As private motoring and road transport became dominant at the expense of classic rail-ferry-rail transits, the significance of Stranraer as the ferry terminal, adjacent to the railway station, declined, and a private sector operator, P&O; Ferries started operating roll-on roll-off ferries on a route from Cairnryan. A new link span was built for the purpose, and the port operation was cheaper than at Stranraer; moreover the sea transit was shorter. As the importance of rail passenger connections further declined, Stena Line, the successor to the British Rail ferry division (Sealink), also transferred to Cairnryan. Rail connections The nearest station is Stranraer with a bus connection from the port connecting with trains to Glasgow Central along the Glasgow South Western Line.

He batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed . Spicer's career began in the Chicago Cubs' farm system with 16-, 21- and 20-victory seasons from 1947‚Äì1949 in levels ranging from Class D (the lowest rung then on the minor league ladder) to Class AA. In 1949 he helped lead the Macon Peaches to the Class A Sally League championship, tying for the league lead in wins with 20, and was selected to the all-star team. He spent four full seasons with the Los Angeles Angels of the top-level Pacific Coast League before the Athletics, newly transplanted from Philadelphia, selected him in the 1954 Rule 5 draft. He was part of the first Major League team to represent Kansas City. In his first game, April 17, 1955, at Briggs Stadium, he entered the game in the fifth inning with the Detroit Tigers already leading the Athletics, 6‚Äì0.

History Construction of the church began in 1823 under the reign of Louis XVIII and was completed in 1836 under the reign of Louis-Philippe. An earlier chapel of the same name was situated at 54 rue Lamartine but was destroyed during the French Revolution. In 1821, plans were made to rebuild Notre-Dame- de-Lorette, with Louis-Hippolyte Lebas the sole architect. Originally, the church was planned to face northward towards Montmartre, but eventually faced southward towards rue Laffitte. Two notable figures in French culture were baptized at Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. Musician Georges Bizet received his baptism at the church on March 16, 1840, while painter Claude Monet was baptized on May 20, 1841.Acte de bapt√™me n¬∞ 37 de l'ann√©e 1840, Registres paroissiaux et d'√©tat civil √† Paris de l'√©glise Notre-Dame-de-Lorette.

In this book she traces the origins of these coffins in the art and religion of the Ga, and questions the history of their evolution. In the course of this research Regula Tschumi discovered the coffin-artist and art brut painter Ataa Oko, born 1919, from La, in Ghana. Ataa Oko was making figurative coffins as long ago as 1945, that is to say, according to her, before Kane Kwei, who was generally recognised outside Ghana as having \\"invented\\" these coffins for the burial rituals of the Ga.Roberta Bonetti, Alternate Histories of the Abebuu Adekai, African Arts, autumn 2010, p. 14-33: Roberta Bonetti reached the same conclusion as Regula Tschumi. She actually considers the well-known stories about the origin of the figure-coffins to have been invented: ‚Äû[...] We have seen how the same criteria of authenticity that were fundamental in documenting the uniqueness and truthfulness of ancient works have been adopted for recent coffins. The proof is provided by the presumed origin of the work, which has become even more precious and exceptional ever since the death of its ‚Äûinvented‚Äú inventor, Kane Kwei‚Äú. In her PhD thesis 2013 Regula Tschumi makes the first deep research about the formerly unknown figurative palanquins of the Ga. She shows how the figurative palanquins are related with the figurative coffins, and why the figurative palanquins were used in Accra as early as 1930. She discovered that differently from what many Ga believe, no chief has ever been buried in his figurative palanquin. Palanquins belong to the powerful royal insignias which in the Ga culture may never be buried. Therefore, kings were not buried in their palanquin, but in a coffin that looked the same like their palanquin. This was necessary because the Ga believe that enstoolments and funerals are complementary.Regula Tschumi, The Figurative Palanquins of the Ga.

It has 47 local systems operating in cities across the United States. However, in several cities it operates under a name other than BCycle (i.e., CAT Bike, Red Bike, GREENbike, etc.)  Description  The BCycle system consists of bicycles and solar-powered stations positioned throughout a city or region. The result is a slight variation in the system, depending on the city of operation. Such variations can include differences in pricing and operating under a name other than BCycle. Notwithstanding, even though they may operate under different names, their stations will still include the logo with a circled \\"B\\" (but perhaps with a different color outer circle). Variations are also affected by the primary sponsors of the local system. BCycle's 2.0 bike share system in front of the Trek Bicycle headquarters in Waterloo, Wisconsin. Boulder B-cycle station with double sided docks. Users of the system can purchase annual memberships or just a day or week pass. The system is intended for short trips rather than using an automobile or bike rentals. They can then check out and return bikes at any station in their city. Depending on the local system and type of membership or pass, users can keep the bicycles for 30‚Äì60 minutes without any additional charge for an unlimited number of times. Bicycles can be used longer for a nominal hourly assessment. However, if a bicycle is returned to any station, it can usually be immediately checked back out for an additional 30-60 free minutes. Another variation is dates and hours of operations. Some systems do not operate at night and some do not operate during the winter months. Notwithstanding the variations, annual memberships are recognized in most BCycle cities in a reciprocity program called \\"B-connected.\\" The cost of annual memberships vary from US$50 to US$80. The bicycles used by BCycle were designed specifically for bike sharing by Trek Bicycle.  History  In 2007, the founding partners of BCycle, Trek and health care insurance company Humana, launched their bike sharing venture with the nation's largest ever temporary bike sharing program at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. Called Freewheelin, this program made 1,000 bikes available to the delegates at both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions. The programs proved so successful that the Democratic host committee selected bike sharing as a special legacy program to receive a donation to launch the country's first smart bike sharing system. Following the Democratic National Convention, Trek, Humana and advertising agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky formed B-Cycle, LLC to develop a technologically and visually appealing bike share system. The joint venture worked with a non-profit created to operate the system, Denver Bike Sharing, operating as Denver B-cycle, to launch with 500 bikes and 40 stations in Denver on Earth Day, April 22, 2010. In 2018, the eighth year of Denver B-cycle, it received a subsidy from the City of Denver government.  Controversy and competition  = Denver, Colorado = In 2018, controversy emerged on the Denver City Council, with criticism that \\"B-cycle is mainly in areas where it's white and wealthy and not in neighborhoods of color and working-class neighborhoods where transit is a need.\\" Substantial competition to dockable bicycle transportation has emerged from unsubsidized \\"[d]ockless bike and scooter companies have flocked to Denver,\\" including Jump bicycles and Lime scooters.

Life and career Pocheptsov with Colin Powell (1998) =Early life= George Pocheptsov, who is sometimes also referred to as \\"Georgie\\", was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1992 to Ukrainian parents. When Pocheptsov was eleven months old, his father was diagnosed with brain cancer; and he died in 1995, at the age of forty. Though he was a toddler, his mother gave him a pencil and some paper to keep him busy. At seventeen months old, he drew a replica of an antique car parked across the street. At a young age, Pocheptsov was drawing jesters, pregnant women, and four-headed giraffes, all in bright color schemes. He started to paint six months before he started to talk. Pocheptsov attended Wrightsville Beach Elementary School in Wilmington, North Carolina. = Abstract and impressionistic period (ages 6-15) = Pocheptsov is completely self-taught in the arts. Pocheptsov is often compared by the press to a young Pablo Picasso or Marc Chagall, particularly for his vivid color palette and early rise to fame. His paintings can sell upward of $200,000. = Three-dimensional canvas and impressionism (ages 16-present) = Starting around the age of 16, George started to focus more on three-dimensional canvas and impressionistic art. The 3D canvas is effectively making a sculpture on canvas. George creates this effect by taking a regular piece of stretched canvas and putting layers of unstretched canvas over it, and then sculpts figures on that layer. At that point, he paints the figures with multiple layers of gesso (a primer), and once they dry, he paints the details onto the sculpture. For more detailed aspects of the sculpture, such as nose, eyelashes, fingers, etc., on a figure, he uses modeling paste. In the end, each figure in the piece has three sides, each painted, making a truly three-dimensional impressionistic piece of art. =Collections and acquisitions = Pocheptsov with Michael Jordan (2009) In recent years, Pocheptsov has been commissioned to create paintings for Colin Powell, Hillary Clinton, Celine Dion, Alain Ducasse, Michael Jordan, among other famous collectors. He was commissioned to create \\"sculptured canvas,\\" a self-defined technique, for the Mitchell Camera Museum in London and for the United Nations' 60th anniversary exhibition. Pocheptsov was also invited to Geneva, Switzerland for a book titled The Arts and Copyright in which he was featured as an artistic figure. Internationally, Pocheptsov has been featured in museums and galleries in England, France, Korea, South Africa, the Netherlands, Russia, Japan, and the Ukraine. = Appearance in popular culture = The media and prominent art collectors refer to Pocheptsov as a child prodigy, especially in the earlier part of his life. Pocheptsov art career appears in magazines and newspapers such as The New York Times, Time, People, Parents, The Washingtonian, US Art, Art and Antiques, Art News, Architectural Digest, Southern Living, Spirit of the Carolinas, among other publications. He has also made appearances on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Good Morning America, The John Walsh Show, The Today Show, Ripley‚Äôs Believe It or Not, The Later Today Show, and Nickelodeon. A documentary film detailing Pocheptsov‚Äôs life titled, A Brush with Destiny, won four Emmy Awards. Philanthropy and charitable work =The George Pocheptsov Foundation= Pocheptsov has used his art career to fund charitable contributions to several charities. In many cases, Pocheptsov donates artwork to a charitable organization, and this artwork is subsequently auctioned at a gala or fundraiser to benefit the charity. To date, Pocheptsov‚Äôs charitable foundation has donated over $8 million through the auctioning of his artwork. Just a few examples of the many charities supported, include the America‚Äôs Promise Alliance by Colin Powell, Georgetown University Pediatrics, Duke University Pediatrics, Adam Walsh Child Resource Center, Habitat for Humanity, the American Cancer Society, The Brain Tumor Awareness Organization, and many others. Overall, he supports between thirty and sixty charities each year. As another means to support a cause, in 2004, Pocheptsov was commissioned to create an official United States postage stamp for the Brain Tumor Awareness Organization.

It is endemic to the state of Colorado in the United States, where it is known from only two counties.USFWS. Eriogonum pelinophilum Five-year Review. September 2009. The most recent estimates available suggest there are 12 occurrences in existence for a total of about 278,000 individual plants in Delta and Montrose Counties. At least 7 occurrences observed in the past have not been relocated but are not yet believed extirpated. This plant is federally listed as an endangered species of the United States.Eriogonum pelinophilum. The Nature Conservancy. This plant was first collected in 1958 but proved difficult to relocate in the wild.Reveal, J. L. (1973). A new subfruticose Eriogonum (Polygonaceae) from western Colorado. Great Basin Naturalist. 33, 2: 120-122. When it was finally found, Eriogonum expert James L. Reveal examined it in the field, compared it to the similar buckwheat Eriogonum contortum, and named it as a new species in 1973. Recent genetic analysis confirms that these two species and Eriogonum clavellatum are indeed similar but are 3 distinct species. The clay-loving wild buckwheat is known only from the adobe clay hills and flats near Delta and Montrose, Colorado. All the occurrences can be found within an area of land 28.5 miles long by 11.5 miles wide. The substrate is pale whitish clay with an alkaline pH that originated from Cretaceous marine sediment. This is not generally a soil type that is hospitable to most plant life; it is very fine-grained, dense, compacted, rich in calcium carbonate, and prone to shrinking and swelling. The soil does not retain water, the pH is high, it is not easy for roots to penetrate, and there is little oxygen. The clay-loving wild buckwheat grows in areas where some moisture is retained, such as swales, where snow persists a bit longer. The habitat supports a few other plants that tolerate the landscape, including mat saltbrush (Atriplex corrugata) and black sagebrush (Artemisia nova), and another adobe-adapted local endemic, the Adobe Hills beardtongue (Penstemon retrorsa). In most areas, the clay-loving buckwheat is the dominant species. This is a subshrub with branches spreading wider than they grow tall, the plant reaching perhaps 12 centimeters tall by 40 wide. The woody stem bases emerge from a big taproot, and as they age the bark comes off in strips or plates. The upper branches are hairless or tufted with bits of hair. There are solitary leaves widely spaced on the branches. They are lance-shaped, no more than 1.5 centimeters long, and hairy on the undersides. The inflorescence is a small, dense cyme of flowers 2 or 3 centimeters long and packed with tiny whitish or cream-colored flowers.Eriogonum pelinophilum. Flora of North America.Reveal, J. L. Eriogonum pelinophilum. Taxonomic Treatment of Eriogonoideae (Polygonaceae). The flowers are pollinated by ants, of which 18 species have been observed on the plants.Center for Plant Conservation This plant has a limited distribution and is found only on a specific substrate. 75% of its habitat is on privately owned land with little protection. Its limited range is threatened by a number of forces. Nearby towns have experienced rapid growth, which has led to an expansion of residential areas with construction of houses, power lines and other utilities, and roads. The area lies within the Uncompahgre River Valley, which hosts agricultural operations fed by a number of canals and ditches. These have access roads. The construction and maintenance of the canals and roads create disturbance in the habitat and help introduce invasive plants to the area. Sediment scooped from the canals is dumped in the plant's habitat. About 40% of the plant's total habitat is affected by these activities. Off- road vehicle use damages the landscape by compacting and eroding soil, creating dust, fragmenting the habitat, and crushing individual plants. The adobe clay substrate is easily broken and eroded because it is bare and contains few plant roots to hold it together. ORV use is currently prohibited in much of the plant's habitat, but if federal protection was removed the threat would be greater.

It was the home to eleven weaving firms, working out of seven mills. Queen Street Mill closed in 1982, and was converted to a textile museum, preserving it as a working mill. It is the world's last 19th-century steam powered weaving mill.  Location  Harle Syke lies at the edge of the Burnley urban area connecting it to the village of Haggate. The main road climbs from the Burnley border to the small crossroads in Haggate, with a road between Nelson and Todmorden. The village dates from the late 19th century, when most of the weaving mills were built. The origins of the name Harle Syke, first used for a farm nearby, are descriptive; Harle is a person's name, while sike or syke is a local word meaning 'ditch'. The village itself is relatively flat rising to 800 feet above sea level. To the south is the valley of the River Don or Thursden Brook and to the north is hill of Marsden Height, () in Brierfield. The buildings in the village are predominantly stone-built. All the public houses are open as of 2015, and it has a social club (Briercliffe Social Club). There is a Church of England church. Harle Syke has direct road links with Burnley and Nelson, and is served by local bus services (4,5) operated by Burnley Bus Company.  History  Briercliffe was named in the Charter of Freewarren granted to Edmund de Lacy the Lord of Blackburnshire in 1251,A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 6 (1911), pp. 468‚Äì473 Extract at British History Online Accessed 2011 allowing him to use the area for hunting hares, rabbits and foxes. In the 18th century, the people of the area worked mostly as farmers and were major producers of wool. There was also a coal mine (which remained open until the middle of the 20th century), that supplied coal to the rapidly growing cotton mills in Burnley. In 1850, a group of men from Haggate founded the first cotton mill in Briercliffe, Harle Syke Mill. They chose a site on farmland next to the road to Burnley, near a natural spring and constructed workers housing close by. The success of Harle Syke Mill (today known as 'Oxford Mill'), which operated as a 'room and power mill', renting out the space and power from line shafts to manufacturing companies, led to further construction. The new village of Harle Syke expanded steadily until World War I. Harle Syke became the base of many Burnley cotton firms during the time when Lancashire was the cotton capital of the world. St James Church, Harle Syke Harle Syke children went to Haggate School, originally a Sunday school for the Baptist Church, which was built on the site of the Haggate cricket pitch in 1882. Most at 12 would become part-timers at one of the mills, or stay on until 13. The school later became the village primary school, and was more recently used by Burnley College.  The mills  In a sense the village was built up around the cotton weaving sheds, or mills as they were also known. The word 'mill' can refer to the building, or to one of the manufacturing companies that rents space in such a mill. For example, Haggate Weaving Company shared the other half of a mill with Altham's of Heasandford Mill, Burnley. There, the buildings and engine were owned by a room and power company called Briercliffe Mill. Because of the availability of room and power, the Harle Syke sheds gave birth to many small companies who grew to build their own reputations and mills in the village, or Burnley and beyond. The first steam driven power loom shed in Briercliffe was a 400 loom shed at Lane Bottom set up by William Smith of Hill End in 1848, near his existing hand loom factory, the 1777 Hill Factory. The Extwistle Mill at Extwistle was a small water powered mill with 100 looms, that eventually converted to steam. In spite of the 1826‚Äì1848 crisis, handloom weavers were still having work put out to them from outside the district, but the community was suffering extreme poverty. Smith's Mill, or Lane End Mill, took on both young women and young men, their parents sticking to hand loom weaving. The 200 paid jobs it provided set new expectations of income for teenagers in the district. 'Harle Syke Shed, the next mill to open in 1858, has an interesting history, not so much for the architecture but the means by which it was financed over the 150 years of its existence. The Haggate Joint Stock Commercial Company was a collaborative venture set up under Sir Robert Peel's Joint Stock Companies Act of 1844. 64 wage-earning men and women signed the deed of settlement and agreed to take up one ¬£10 share paying a one shilling deposit. Two thirds of them were weavers. Though co-operative in name, the company structure was structured to make profit, and the companies like this that did make it through the downturn of 1857, and the severe recession caused by the Cotton Famine of 1862‚Äì63, were more severe employers than the private family businesses. Shares were traded, and dividend paid, and the shareholders often contributed unpaid work to keep the business as well as having unlimited liability for the companies debts. In effect they were running two businesses, protecting the capital assets that were the buildings, boilers and engine, and then manufacturing and trading in cotton cloth. The five elected directors had a great deal of discretion on how and how long the business should operate. In 1865, the company was reorganised. The Haggate Joint Stock Commercial Company became solely a room and power company. The looms were disposed of to the shareholders, each receiving a pro-rata allocation. In 1865, the property company appears to have achieved steady growth and was expanded in the 1860s and 1880s. The producer partnerships that were formed when the looms were allocated consolidated, and shares in the room and power 'walls' company were traded resulting in a smaller number of shareholders with larger investments. There were seven 'producer partnerships' in 1865. Briercliffe Mill was a direct imitation of the reconstituted Harle Syke Mill. It was a pure room and power mill built in 1880 directly opposite it. It was occupied by two firms: Abraham Altham and the Haggate Weaving Company. The Briercliffe Mill Company and the Haggate Weaving Company were both taken over by Taylor & Hartley of Westhoughton, and the company closed in 1960. The Queen Street Manufacturing Company was a later direct imitation of the Haggate Joint Stock Commercial Company. It took advantage of favourable trading conditions in 1894 to finance itself with 4000 ¬£5.00 shares sold mainly to locals. It built and then extended Queen Street Mill having 1135 Burnley looms. At times it also rented space at the adjoining Primrose Mill, bringing its loomage up to 1500. There was a lot of activity in 1903‚Äì1905. The Haggate Joint Stock Commercial Company went into liquidation on 28 February 1903 with the assets passing to the Harle Syke Mill Company. The Haggate ¬£10 shares were valued at ¬£25, and the 53 shareholders in the old company were paid in shares in the new company. The directors were the same. This was used as an opportunity to expand. A new larger engine was purchased, and a large new weaving shed designed by Joseph Keithley was built. The new company was a property company and a production company. The new shed accommodated 900 looms. Additional funding was found by issuing promissory notes at a rate of 4%. A mortgage for ¬£12000 was obtained from the Burnley Building Society. Walshaw Mill was incorporated 5 January 1905. It was financed with 12000 ¬£1 shares and recapitalised later with an additional 30000. It started with 586 looms which was later increased to nearly 1100. Alongside Queen Street Mill were two other thousand loom sheds. Primrose Mill was built in 1906 by the West family so was not a joint stock company, and neither was the King's Mill. Of the mills, Harle Syke Mill, now called Oxford Mill, and Siberia Mill, are rebuilt as industrial units and there are plans for some housing. Briercliffe Mill is in use by various firms including for document storage, and similarly with Walshaw Mill. Kings Mill is now an antiques centre, Queen Street Mill is a textile museum, and Primrose has been demolished after a fire, when it was being used to make beds.  The mill engines  Harle Syke is unique in having preserved two of its mill engines. The first is in Queen Street Mill and has never been moved, but the second is preserved in the Science Museum in London, and came from Siberia Mill, it is a cross compound engine, of 700 hp. The Queen Street Mill engine is an 1895 single tandem compound of 500 hp Corliss valves driving a flywheel. The London engine which came from Harle Syke mill is a cross compound with Corliss valves driving an 18-ft, 6-inch flywheel. It was constructed in 1903 by Burnley Ironworks.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 17, 2011. In the episode, Leslie and her co-workers hold Pawnee's harvest festival, the success of which will determine the future of the parks department. The festival faces several obstacles, including a supposed Native American curse, a missing miniature horse and a scandal-hungry media. Meanwhile, Ann tries to cope with her recent break-up, and April confesses her love to Andy, then becomes angry with his response. Written by Daniel J. Goor and directed by Dean Holland, the episode marked the culmination of a seven-episode story arc about the harvest festival that began with the third-season premiere, \\"Go Big or Go Home\\". Unlike the first six episodes of the season, it was not written and produced immediately following the second season, which had been done to accommodate actress Amy Poehler's pregnancy. The episode also does not feature Rob Lowe as he was originally only expected to be a guest star when the episode was conceived; however, he does return for subsequent episodes as a regular cast member. The episode featured appearances by regular guest stars Mo Collins and Jay Jackson, as well as the first appearance by Jonathan Joss as the leader of a local Native American tribe. The harvest festival scenes were shot at Los Angeles Pierce College, and an aerial shot of the festival itself was the most expensive shot in the series. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Harvest Festival\\" was seen by 4.08 million household viewers, one of the lowest ratings of the series. The episode received critical acclaim, with many reviewers calling it one of the show's best episodes as well as a major turning point in the series. Plot With the Harvest Festival days away, Leslie (Amy Poehler) surprises everyone by booking Li'l Sebastian, a miniature horse and legendary Pawnee celebrity. Everyone is thrilled except Ben (Adam Scott), who doesn't understand the fascination. The chief of the local Wamapoke tribe, Ken Hotate (Jonathan Joss), visits the parks department and requests the harvest festival be moved, as it is built upon the site of a Wamapoke massacre. When Leslie explains it is too late, Ken warns them the festival may become cursed, although he privately tells the documentary crew that \\"there are two things [he] know[s] about white people: they love Rachael Ray, and they are terrified of curses.\\" Ann (Rashida Jones) works the harvest festival first aid tent, where she confides in Donna (Retta) that she has not taken the break-up with Chris (Rob Lowe) well. April (Aubrey Plaza) tells Andy (Chris Pratt) that she loves him, but grows angry when he replies, \\"Dude, shut up! That is awesomesauce!\\" Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) arrives to report on the festival and is determined to find a negative story, although she does show excitement over Li'l Sebastian. She initially fails to find a scandal, but then overhears Leslie and Ben discussing the curse. It becomes the focus of her story, especially after Tom (Aziz Ansari) tells Leslie that Li'l Sebastian escaped his pen. Tom blames Jerry (Jim O'Heir), although it was entirely Tom's fault. The Pawnee media swarms the festival to cover the curse, endangering its opening the next day with the bad press, with one reporter likening Ben's past as a failed teen mayor with the curse. Now believing himself to be the curse, Ben leaves the festival. As Leslie reassures the reporters there is no curse, the power generator blows out, leaving the festival dark and stranding most of the parks department on a Ferris wheel. Using the blackout as an excuse, Ann takes Donna's advice to make out with Kiley (Joey Russo), her dumb but attractive patient. On the Ferris wheel, with April and Andy arguing below him and Tom and Jerry arguing above him, an annoyed Ron (Nick Offerman) clears the air by announcing the obvious: April is mad at Andy for not telling her that he loves her back, and the missing Li'l Sebastian is Tom's fault. Andy tells April that he clearly loves her and they hug, and Tom apologizes to Jerry. Later, everyone spots Li'l Sebastian in the corn maze and recover him. Leslie learns the power outage was due to television crews plugging into the grid and overloading it. The only replacement generator in Pawnee is at the Wamapoke casino, and Leslie humbly asks Ken to loan it to her in exchange for placing a Wamapoke cultural exhibit near the Harvest Festival entrance. Ken agrees, and during the festival opening the next morning, he performs a meaningless ceremony to remove the fake curse. People begin to swarm into the festival, and Leslie cheerfully greets them. Ben returns to apologize to Leslie for leaving, admitting that he is not over his past. She reassures him the festival is as much his accomplishment as hers, and even has Ken break Ben's \\"curse\\", although Ken's gesture is also completely meaningless. At the end, Ben appears to have been won over by Li'l Sebastian, but admits to the camera crew that he still fails to see the appeal and remains as baffled as ever. Production \\"Harvest Festival\\" was written by Daniel J. Goor and directed by Dean Holland. The episode marked the culmination of a seven-episode story arc that began with the third season premiere, \\"Go Big or Go Home\\", in which Leslie and the parks department prepare to relaunch the harvest festival, which had previously been a Pawnee tradition before it ended. The storyline stemmed from serious budget problems facing Pawnee which forced a government shutdown and threatened major cuts to the parks department, prompting Leslie to bring the harvest festival back and stake the future of the entire department on its success or failure. Amy Poehler said she believed the storyline was appropriate for a series about small government and was well handled by the writers: \\"What I like about the show is it doesn't spend 25 episodes talking about this thing, it talks about it in the right amount of time. It happens and then there's consequences of it. The show keeps moving forward, which is always really fun.\\" Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur described \\"Harvest Festival\\" as a particularly empowering episode for Leslie Knope, played by Amy Poehler (pictured). \\"Harvest Festival\\" was the first episode of the season written and produced separately from the second season. The previous six episodes from the third season were filmed almost immediately after the second season ended as part of an early shooting schedule to accommodate Poehler's pregnancy. Series co-creator Michael Schur described it as a particularly empowering episode for the Leslie Knope character: \\"When you see this episode [...] it makes you love her even more. This episode is about Leslie being noticed for the incredible hard work she does.\\" Schur also said he believed the subplot with April and Andy was one that several young people in their situation have faced in real life: \\"Andy is put into a situation that a lot of people have been put into in our lives and he does the exact wrong thing you can do. And that's sort of the template for them going forward is what's the wrongest thing you can do? That's sort of how we follow them.\\" Chris Pratt said he believed the conflict provided strong romantic and comedic potential for the characters: \\"There definitely will be conflict in their relationship [and] there's still a lot of room for comedy in there, because we have good writers.\\" Rob Lowe, a regular cast member with Parks and Recreation, did not appear in \\"Harvest Festival\\" because the actor was originally slated to only appear in the first six episodes of the season as a guest star. However, after those episodes were filmed, Lowe joined the cast as a permanent cast member, and his character Chris Traeger would return in the next episode, \\"Camping\\", as well as all subsequent episodes. \\"Harvest Festival\\" included guest appearances by Mo Collins and Jay Jackson as, respectively, Joan Callamezzo and Perd Hapley, two Pawnee television journalists who appeared in multiple Parks and Recreation episodes. It also featured the first guest appearance of Jonathan Joss as Wamapoke tribe leader Ken Hotate. Joss previously voiced John Redcorn in the animated television series King of the Hill, which was co-created by Parks and Recreation co-creator Greg Daniels. Schur said while writing about the Native American curse, the writing staff wanted it to be the local media that turned it into an issue rather than the citizens of Pawnee, because they felt it would be too cartoonish and unbelievable for the residents to take it so seriously. Due to budget constraints, the Parks and Recreation set department did not build the harvest festival and corn maze sets, but instead filmed the episode at the annual Halloween Harvest Festival at Los Angeles Pierce College, a community college in California. Michael Schur said the aerial shot of the harvest festival at the end of the episode was the most expensive in the entire series. The episode was filmed out of sequence from the rest of the season so the weather would be cooler when the scenes were shot; Schur jokingly said if this was not done, \\"the week that we would have been shooting it was like 148 degrees here and the actors would be dead now\\". \\"Harvest Festival\\" was screened for members of the media during a January 2011 NBC press junket. Afterward, the reporters were taken to the set of Parks and Recreation where they were able to greet and pose for photos with the actual miniature horse who played Li'l Sebastian. Shortly after the episode aired, a \\"Producer's Cut\\" version was made available on the official NBC website. It was about five minutes longer than the televised version and included several scenes that were originally cut due to length limitations, including an extended cold open with the parks department meeting Li'l Sebastian, and additional scenes of Leslie meeting with Pawnee constituents before the Harvest Festival. Cultural references When Ben fails to understand the appeal of Li'l Sebastian, Ron explains the miniature horse has an honorary degree from the University of Notre Dame, a school in Indiana, the state where Parks and Recreation series is set. In a later scene, Ben compares Leslie to a Jedi, a type of warrior in the science fiction franchise Star Wars, prompting Leslie and Tom to mock him as a nerd. During one scene, Ken Hotate says, \\"I know two things about white people: they love Matchbox Twenty, and they are terrified of curses.\\" The former refers to an American rock band, which is later also featured on the marquee of an exterior shot of a Wamapoke casino. (The extended cut replaces Matchbox Twenty with Rachael Ray in both instances.) Ann claims that, while distraught from her breakup with Chris, she bought $700-worth of candles from Anthropologie, a retail store that sells women's apparel and home accessories. One of the harvest festival booths features Pawnee celebrity Aunt Tilda, the fictional aunt of basketball player Larry Bird, who is from Indiana. \\"American Girl\\", a song by the rock band Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, plays during one scene showing an overview of the harvest festival. A news report about the supposed curse is presented in a Taiwanese animation clip featuring Leslie and Ken Hotate, in the style of the animation company Next Media Animation. While interviewing Hotate, Perd Hapley compared the curse to the horror film Poltergeist (1982). Several commentators compared the man who flirted with Ann to the characters of Jersey Shore, an MTV reality series about young people living in a house by the Jersey Shore beach. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Harvest Festival\\" was seen by an estimated 4.08 million household viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, with a 1.8 rating/5 share among viewers between ages 18 and 49. It was one of the lowest ratings of the series to date, and marked a 25 percent drop from the previous original episode, \\"Indianapolis\\". The ratings suffered in part because its lead-in show, The Office, was a repeat; all the other NBC comedy shows that Thursday, including 30 Rock, Community, Perfect Couples and Outsourced, also saw lower ratings than their previous episodes. Parks and Recreation was defeated in its 9:30 p.m. timeslot by the Fox comedy-drama series Bones, which was seen by 11.34 million households; the ABC medical drama Private Practice, which was seen by 5.97 million households; and CBS coverage of NCAA basketball, which was seen by 4.44 million households. In network television, it defeated only a remake of the CW Network drama Nikita, which drew 1.37 million households. =Reviews= \\"Harvest Festival\\" received critical acclaim. New York magazine writer Steve Kandell called it the most pivotal episode of the season in terms of \\"resolving and resetting narrative stakes\\", as well as the most complex from a production perspective. Kandell wrote, \\"There's something that feels particularly satisfying about watching a wholly sympathetic, albeit fictional, character like Leslie Knope do well by her own ambition and by her friends.\\" Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker said the episode placed Parks and Recreation \\"squarely in the tradition of great gentle-hearted sitcoms\\" that treated its characters \\"with equal affection, and has relatively little patience for irony and cool detachment\\". He praised Amy Poehler's performance, and enjoyed how the characters' excitement over Li'l Sebastian demonstrated how \\"in some parts of this great land, there are people who aren‚Äôt jaded, who are open to wonderment, who find vessels in which to pour their joy\\". HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall said \\"Harvest Festival\\" may be his favorite episode of the season thus far, and demonstrates how the series has evolved. While in the first season he said Leslie was too over-the-top in a relatively ordinary setting, Sepinwall said this episode showed Parks and Recreation \\"has successfully made the rest of Pawnee seem as believably crazy as Leslie, if not moreso\\". TV Squad television reviewer Maureen Ryan called \\"Harvest Festival\\" a \\"delightful, comedically deft episode, one that depicts the mildly demented world of Pawnee in loving detail\\". Joel Keller, also of TV Squad, called it one of the best episodes of the season, and that it provided each member of the ensemble cast moments to shine. He praised how the episode combined the \\"funny small-townness of a place like Pawnee and the realities of being in city government\\". James Poniewozik of Time magazine called it a \\"splendid\\" episode that \\"combined slapstick, authentic stakes and a holistic picture of the oddball history and commonalities that bond the folks we've come to know in Pawnee\\". Punchline Magazine writer Megan Gilbert said the episode featured \\"plenty of laugh-out-loud moments\\" and particularly enjoyed the \\"sweet non-aggressive fighting\\" between April and Andy. Gilbert felt Adam Scott was underused, but praised the performances of Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari and Mo Collins. TV Guide writer Damian Holbrook said the difficulties that plague the harvest festival were funny, \\"but like the best of Parks, these hiccups are matched with acres of heart\\". He praised the growing romantic interest between Leslie and Ben, as well as the subplot about Andy and April. Alex Strachan of the Montreal Gazette praised the show for being funny without resorting to cynicism or cruel jokes, and called the series \\"one of the sharpest, smartest comedies on TV at the moment\\". He also called the Wamapoke curse subplot \\"wildly politically incorrect, but funny\\". National Post writer Scott Stinson said Parks and Recreation \\"continues to challenge for the title of best comedy on television\\", and called the continuing romance between April and Andy a \\"welcome development\\" for both characters. Hollywood.com writer Eric Sundermann enjoyed the new direction Ann's character was taking, as well as how \\"Harvest Festival\\" accurately portrays small-town life. Rick Porter of Zap2it said the episode \\"put a great cap on the first portion of the season\\". He called Andy and April \\"a recipe for excellent comedy\\" and called the slowly developing romance of Ben and Leslie extremely rewarding. Andy Daglas of ChicagoNow called it a \\"pure delight from beginning to end\\" and a good entry point for newcomers to the show. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called the episode \\"celebration of the whackjobs that live in Pawnee and how their singular focus can make for some adorably naive comedy\\". While he praised the main subplot, he said it was too early in April and Andy's relationship for them to declare their love for each other, and said April's declaration \\"came out of nowhere\\". Matt Fowler of IGN said it was not his favorite episode, as the jokes about Ben's past felt repetitive compared to past episodes, and the April and Andy subplot \\"fell a little flat\\". However, he said it was \\"chock full of dozens of little moments that make the entire episode worthwhile\\", and particularly praised the Native American curse and the parody of the media.

The celebration was started in 1975 by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) in an attempt to create an event similar to Earth Day. Food Day in the U.S. was created to raise awareness about the increasing industrialization of American agriculture, rising food prices, hunger, and the American diet and health crisis. Food Day in the U.S. only lasted until 1977, until 2011, when CSPI revived the National Food Day campaign. The Food Day initiative is now run by Food Day.org within CSPI. Food Day is still focused on raising awareness and changing behaviors related to food in the U.S. Issues of concern include: nutrition education, food rescue, sustainable agriculture, hunger, farm animal welfare, and farm and food service worker rights. Food Day in the U.S. is typically celebrated by nationwide and local events to educate people about the food system and/or to gain support for policies that event hosts deem to be improvements for the current food system, such as improved nutrition labels, funding for SNAP, and decreased use of antibiotics in food-producing animals typically in factory farms. 2,300 events took place across the country during Food Day in 2011, 3,200 in 2012, and over 4,700 events in 2013. Events have been hosted by a variety of different groups including local governments, food co-ops, schools, college campuses, non-profits, businesses, government agencies, food banks, farms and farmers, and restaurants. Food Day or Food Day Canada is a culinary celebration that originated in Canada as \\"The World's Longest BBQ\\" in reaction to the BSE crisis of 2003. This economic crisis for farmers was a trade embargo by the US on Canadian beef, based on a single case of BSE (or mad cow disease) in Alberta, Canada. Since that year, Food Day has evolved into a celebration by chefs from across Canada. Food Day happens every day in Canada on the Saturday of the August long weekend (also known as the Civic Holiday Weekend). Food Day was founded by Canadian culinary pioneer, Anita Stewart.

The Academy granted master's and doctorate degrees in theology and was designed to prepare officers for senior positions in the Catholic Church hierarchy. It originated at the Vilnius University, but was transferred to Saint Petersburg in the aftermath of the Uprising of 1831. The Tsarist authorities wanted to exercise greater control over the Academy and implement Russification policies. After the October Revolution in 1917, the Academy was moved to Poland where it became the Catholic University of Lublin. A new theological seminary was established in Moscow in 1993; it moved to the premises of the historical Saint Petersburg Academy in 1995. In Vilnius The academy traced its roots to the Supreme Theological Seminary of Vilnius University established in 1803‚Äì1808 in the Augustine monastery. After the Uprising of 1831, the University was closed leaving only two Academies ‚Äì the Academy of Medicine‚ÄìSurgery and the Theological Academy. Both of them were subordinated to the Ministry of Internal Affairs (as opposed to Ministry of Education or Bishop of Vilnius). Vilnius Theological Academy was officially established on July 1, 1833. Courses included theology, scripture, homiletics, Biblical hermeneutics and archaeology, history of Christianity, canon law, logic, ethics, classical, Polish, and Russian languages and literature, world and Russian history. The lectures were held in Latin and Russian languages. The Academy had about 40 students; the section devoted to the Armenian Catholic Church had 7 students. Its rectors were Alojzy Osi≈Ñski (former lecturer at the Liceum Krzemienieckie; 1770‚Äì1842) and Antoni Fija≈Çkowski (former professor at Vilnius University; 1797‚Äì1883). The Academy had 8 faculty members, who included philologist Leon Borowski, philosopher Anio≈Ç Dowgird, historian Pawe≈Ç Kukolnik. The Academy closely cooperated with Vilnius Priest Seminary. Around 1840, the Tsarist authorities suspected that the students were planning another uprising. Therefore, the academy, including its students, professors, and library, was moved to Saint Petersburg in August 1842. The Academy of Medicine‚ÄìSurgery was also closed, transferring its assets to the University of Kiev. Vilnius and Lithuania were left without an institution of higher education. In Saint Petersburg Teachers and fourth-year students of the academy in 1907 In Saint Petersburg, the Academy settled in the former palace of the Russian Academy on the Vasilyevsky Island in 1844. The purchase and reconstruction of the premises was financed with funds of closed Catholic monasteries. The consecration ceremony of the palace was attended by Emperor Nicholas I. On that occasion the Academy was granted the title \\"Imperial Academy\\". All other Catholic academies became its subordinates. The number of students was limited to 40; the limit was increased to 60 after the Roman Catholic Clerical Academy in Warsaw was closed in 1867. From 1885 to 1917, the Academy published students' research papers in a yearbook. Most gifted students were sent for further studies to western universities. In 1906, the Academy had 13 faculty members. After the October Revolution in 1917, the Academy was closed and moved to Poland where it became the Catholic University of Lublin.

Playing career Despite attending a rugby playing school in Leicester Prentice was a keen footballer in his youth. During The First World War he served with the Royal Artillery and, when posted to France, joined the ANZACs whose enthusiasm for rugby converted him. He was badly wounded at Passchendaele in 1917. Prentice began his rugby career with local side Westleigh, at the time Leicester was strictly an invitation only club and his debut for side came on 26 November 1923 away to Neath, Tigers lost 37‚Äì6 but Prentice scored one of Leicester's two tries. Prentice quickly established himself in the Leicester's first choice side playing 24 of the season's 30 remaining games. Forwards' positions were not specialized in this period and he is recorded simply as playing \\"forward\\" until the 1927‚Äì28 season. From then onward Prentice is recorded as having mainly played prop for Leicester, despite his international caps coming at either Number 8 or Lock. Prentice was a regular try scorer for Leicester scoring 7 tries in his first season and 8 in 31 games the next. By 1926 Prentice had become Leicester's secondary goal-kicker, taking the duties when club captain Harold Day was not selected. He succeeded Day as both captain and place-kicker for the 1928‚Äì29 season where he was top scorer with 134 points in 31 games and on 11 February 1928 made his international debut for in a 7‚Äì6 win over at Lansdowne Road. Prentice played in England's next two games against and to secure the 1928 Five Nations Championship and the grandslam. Leicester did not prosper however recording more losses than wins for the first time since 1889‚Äì90. His second season as captain saw a return to regular winning ways; Tigers won 26 of their 39 games whilst Prentice was again top scorer with 106 points in 26 matches. Prentice was selected to take part in the 1930 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia, and after former Tigers teammate Wavell Wakefield was forced to withdraw he also became captain of the tour. At the age of 34 and past his prime playing days Prentice only played in 12 of the 29 matches. He did captain the side in the second test against the New Zealanders and the sole test against , both of which were lost. He returned from the tour and played a final season for Leicester, featuring in 24 games he top-scored with 104 points despite missing the first 13 whilst on the Lions tour. On 18 April 1931 he was given the honour of captaining the side in his final appearance, a 25‚Äì5 win against Blackheath at Welford Road. Administration career After retiring from playing rugby in 1931 Prentice moved into the administration of the game. He became an national team selector in 1932 and was manager of the 1936 British Lions tour to Argentina. He became Secretary of the Rugby Football Union in 1947, at this point he stopped being a selector for the national side, and held the position for 15 years until ill health forced him to retire in 1962. During the Second World War he served in the Royal Army Service Corps and was taken prisoner.

Fossils were found in the Windyfield chert, Rhynie, Scotland. Some features, such as bivalved sporangia borne laterally and the anatomy of the xylem, relate this genus to the zosterophylls. Other features are unclear due to poor preservation. Description Fossils of Ventarura were found in the Windyfield chert, slightly separate from the better-known Rhynie chert, both located near the village of Rhynie, Scotland. Only fragmentary fossils were found, the longest being around 12 cm long. Stems (axes) of two kinds were found, although without clear connections between them. Aerial stems were leafless, smooth and dichotomously branched. They contained an exarch xylem strand containing G-type tracheids. Alone among the Rhynie chert plants, there was evidence of sclerenchyma ‚Äì supporting tissue made up of dead cells with thick cell walls. Spore-forming organs or sporangia were borne on the sides of the stems, attached without clear stalks. They consisted of two circular to pear-shaped 'valves', one slightly narrower facing the stem, one away from it. Sporangia may have formed a two-rowed spike or strobilus. Spores were shed via a slit at the top of the sporangium between thickened valve borders. Spores were of one kind, about 67 ¬µm in diameter, without trilete marks. What are thought to be the underground stems of Ventarura had single-celled hairs, presumably rhizoids, on all sides. They branched irregularly and more often compared to aerial stems. Phylogeny Ventarura was described too late to be included in the cladistic studies published by Kenrick and Crane in 1997 which are the source of much of the information on the phylogeny of early land plants (see Polysporangiophytes: Taxonomy). The shape of the sporangia and their lateral position as well as the anatomy of the xylem show a clear relationship to the zosterophylls. However, the arrangement of the sporangia is difficult to determine from the fossil specimens. Zosterophylls are thought to be the earliest diverging group of lycophytes, a group which includes modern clubmosses and relatives.

This wood-frame structure has a low oval entrance, leading into a square chamber with a central fire pit, decorated with carved \\"house posts\\". A stylized raven adorns the main facade. The carvings on the house were executed by Charles Brown, a Native from Saxman. The United States Forest Service used Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) funds to hire skilled carvers from among the older Native Alaskans to repair or duplicate totem poles that were abandoned when the natives moved to communities where work was available. The CCC project built the community house and placed 15 totem poles, most of them replicas of 19th-century poles. At statehood in 1959, title to the land passed from the federal government to the State of Alaska.

Emanuel Vidoviƒá was instrumental in bringing the modern art ideas to Split. From 1900 he was an active member of the Literary-Art Club, and in 1907, together with Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, he founded the Meduliƒá Society. Though he had trained at the Academy of Arts in Venice, he never completed his formal studies, preferring instead to paint scenes of Venice ‚Äì interiors, views of canals, lagoons and motifs from around the town of Chioggia. In 1898, he returned to his home city of Split, bringing new ideas of post-impressionist style light and intense colour. He painted plein air landscapes, and more stylized, larger canvases back in his studio. His early work contained literary allusions to South Slavic history and legends, in an art nouveau style. Later work would become darker, with brighter accents, and expressionist style black outlines around forms. His landscapes, and especially his later interiors of churches around Split and Trogir were well received by critics and the public. Vidoviƒá was elected a corresponding member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1949. He exhibited his work at solo and group shows within Croatia and abroad. For many years he was Professor of Drawing at the High School, and at the School of Crafts in Split. In 1986, the Emanuel Vidoviƒá Gallery was opened in Split, featuring the life and works of the artist. Biography Vidoviƒá was the first child of Ivan Vidoviƒá from Split, and Pa≈°kva (n√©e Grubiƒá) from nearby Solin. He was born on Christmas Eve 1870 in a stone cottage in the Veli Varo≈° area of city. After elementary school, he attended the Imperial Royal High School (Cesarsko- kraljevsku Veliku Realku) in Split, where he studied drawing with the architect and painter Emil Vecchietti. In 1887, the 17-year-old Vidoviƒá enrolled as a student of sculpture at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Venice. He transferred to the painting department, but was dissatisfied with the conservatism of the teaching, and in 1890 gave up his formal studies. He struggled for a time to support himself, painting scenes around Venice. In 1892 he arrived in Milan, where he worked at Famiglia Artistica. In 1894, one of Vidoviƒá's paintings was exhibited in Milan along with works by Giovanni Segantini. That same year, he spent time in Chioggia, a quiet fishing town with picturesque lagoons and canals. Among the paintings of the time was a canvas bathed in light, painted in broad strokes, and some romantic dawn and dusk landscapes, which reflect the spirit of symbolism. On his return to Split, Vidoviƒá developed a close relationship with painters Josip Laliƒá, Ante Katunariƒá and Virgil Meneghello Dinƒçiƒá, and with the builder Ante Beziƒá. In 1896 he exhibited his work locally, and the following year at an international exhibition in Copenhagen. In 1897 he spent almost a year in Chioggia, this time in the company of Ante Katunariƒá. From this productive time come views of Chioggia, Venice and Giudecca, where sunlit forms are portrayed in shimmering strokes of colour, and details are all but lost. Back in Split in 1898, Vidoviƒá painted local scenes in the same style. He became alternate drawing master at the high school, and set up his first studio. That year, also, he married Amalija Baffo from Chioggia. Establishment of the Literary-Art Club (Knji≈æevno-umjetniƒçkog kluba) in 1900 brought modern art to Split. Emanuel Vidoviƒá was one of its most active members, organizing its first exhibition together with Josip Laliƒá in 1901. In addition to his oil paintings he also showed a few caricatures. In 1903, Vidoviƒá held his first solo exhibitions in Split and Zagreb, and appeared in group exhibitions in Milan, London, Vienna and Sofia. In 1908 Vidoviƒá was one of the organizers of the big Dalmatian art exhibition, and in the same year along with Katunariƒá and Dinciƒá began to publish a satirical paper Duje Balavac. Ivan Me≈°troviƒá and Vidoviƒá founded the Meduliƒá Society, along with other young artists of the area. In 1909 Vidoviƒá was appointed professor of drawing at the School of Crafts (Obrtnoj ≈°koli) in Split. After the war, in 1919, Vidoviƒá held his second solo exhibit in Split, which later transferred to Zagreb, Belgrade, and Osijek. Then he moved into the studio which he used for 1919‚Äì1942 in the attic of the former government building on Klaiƒáev Square. In 1923 he held a solo exhibit in Prague, and in 1924 a joint exhibit with Anƒëelo Uvodiƒá opened at the salon of Ivan Galiƒá in Split. Emanuel Vidoviƒá organized the Great Jubilee Exhibition in 1929 in Split and Zagreb, and 1931 in Belgrade. At this time his oil paintings began to show new themes ‚Äì still lifes and interiors, and he also exhibited landscapes in pastels. During the early 1930s, Vidoviƒá created a significant cycle of Trogir landscapes which were exhibited in Split in 1936. These new works represented a departure from his earlier literary symbolism and were warmly received both by the public and by critics. In 1939, Vidoviƒá took part in the festival, \\"Half a century Croatian art\\" (Pola vijeka hrvatske umjetnosti) in Zagreb, and also held a new solo exhibit at Salon Galiƒá in Split. They showed interiors of churches and his studio, and still lifes. During 1938‚Äì1942 he painted a series of church interiors, developing a new approach to depicting space. Deep three- dimensional spaces taken from many different viewpoints are balanced by a refined treatment. The Trogir cycle of 1936 was welcomed by critics, and he was elected to participate in the Venice Biennales of 1942 and 1952. During the war he retired to his studio and focused on painting interiors and still lifes. In 1949 Vidovic was elected a corresponding member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts and in 1952 a retrospective exhibition of his work was held in Zagreb. Emanuel Vidovic died on 1 June 1953. Legacy Vidoviƒá's early paintings of Venice, Milan and Chioggia, were inspired Segantini's divisionism technique. His paintings of Chioggia, in particular, range from soft lyrical twilight atmospheres to bright, colourful sunlit landscape and seascapes. In Split and the surrounding area Vidoviƒá made many studies and sketches in plein-air, working with bright colours in the live landscape. Later in his studio, in transferring these fresh impressions to large canvases, Vidoviƒá would create a soft, lyrical and often symbolic atmosphere. His palette was getting darker, and many of these paintings demonstrate a strength and originality. On the brighter sections within otherwise dark paintings Vidoviƒá created intensive luminous and colourful effects. In the diptych Small World (Mali svijet) Vidoviƒá experimented with Segantini divisions achieving a work of pure style. In Angelus (1906/7) space disappears, and the entire image is created with red planes of shimmering dots, and forms are reduced to a few peaceful horizontal lines. Around 1920, Vidoviƒá's painting style changed ‚Äì his palette became dark (mostly blue, green, brown and black) with the occasional accent of bright colour, forms outlined in black with lines that tended to become distorted, giving the paintings an expressionist feeling. From 1930 Vidoviƒá paid regular visits to Trogir, attracted by the patina that long years gave to its architecture. At that time he also started painting still life, mainly inspired by ancient sculptures, church objects and antiques in his Split studio. He moved away from the earlier literary symbolism, his palette became brighter, drawings clearer while his artistic experience was reflected in lyrical notes and a typical Mediterranean atmosphere. As a professor at the High School and at the School of Decorative Arts in Split, Vidoviƒá taught the younger generation of artists. In 1986, the Emanuel Vidoviƒá Gallery was opened in Split, featuring the life and works of the artist. Part of the City Museum in Split, it contains a collection of paintings, photographs, and the artists's studio.

It is endemic to the state of Florida in the United States where it is known only from Highlands County.USFWS. Eryngium cuneifolium Five- year Review. July 2010. It is one of many rare species that can be found only on the Lake Wales Ridge, an area of high endemism.Eryngium cuneifolium. Center for Plant Conservation.Why Save Species? Archibold Station. It was federally listed as an endangered species of the United States in 1987.Eryngium cuneifolium. The Nature Conservancy. This is an erect perennial herb growing 20 to 66 centimeters in maximum height. The woody taproot may be over 20 centimeters long. The distinctive leaves are wedge-shaped with usually three bristle-tipped teeth at the tips. The basal leaves are largest and there are a few smaller ones along the erect flowering stem. The herbage is aromatic. The inflorescence is a compound umbel of several dense headlike clusters of flowers. Each individual flower has five sharp-pointed sepals, making the clusters bristly. The flowers have white, or possibly blue, or greenish flowers. Blooming occurs in July through January, but especially August through October. This is a plant of the Florida scrub. It grows in bare stretches of white sand, including gaps in the rosemary and sand pine scrub and in blowouts. The land is dry and the bare, sunny gaps in the scrub are maintained by periodic wildfire. Other plants in the habitat include silk bay (Persea humilis), scrub palmetto (Sabal etonia), eastern prickly pear (Opuntia humifusa), and several species of oak. There are 19 known occurrences of this plant, all within one Florida county. Eight are on protected land, such as the Lake Wales Ridge Wildlife Area. The other 11 are on private, unprotected land. Their status is not certain, but four of these occurrences are believed extirpated or on the verge of destruction. Remaining stretches of Florida scrub such as that inhabited by the snakeroot are vulnerable to destruction. Much of it has been consumed for development and for agriculture, especially citrus groves.Eryngium cuneifolium. Multi-species Recovery Plan for South Florida. Habitat that remains is in a fragmented condition. In many areas, including some of the protected regions, the land is not properly managed to maintain the natural habitat. The Florida scrub is a fire-prone landscape and many of the plants require fire every few decades to thrive. This snakeroot, for example, requires periodic disturbance such as fire to clear out tall and woody vegetation that grows up around it and blocks the sun. The plant requires wide open habitat for survival, and plants located farther from other shrubs grow more successfully.Menges, E. S. and J. Kimmich. (1996). Microhabitat and time-since-fire: Effects on demography of Eryngium cuneifolium (Apiaceae), a Florida scrub endemic plant. American Journal of Botany 83:2 185-91. Fire suppression, which is practiced to prevent property damage, prevents this disturbance and leads to overgrowth of the scrub. This species also needs fire in order to germinate, because excessive leaf litter and lichen cover on the ground inhibit this process. The snakeroot population skyrockets after the scrub is burned, and its survival, growth, and fecundity are increased.Menges, E. S. and P. F. Quintana-Ascencio. (2004). Population viability with fire in Eryngium cuneifolium: Deciphering a decade of demographic data. Ecological Monographs 74:1 79-99. During fire, the plant is destroyed, but its soil seed bank is exposed for germination, and many seedlings occur. The plant has a limited capacity for dispersal, and most seeds end up in the ground near the parent plant. Germination also may be inhibited by the scrub rosemary, which produces allelopathic compounds.

Fossils were found in the Rhynie chert, Scotland. The remains are very fragmentary, but the plant appears to be related to the zosterophylls. Description Trichopherophyton was described from very fragmentary fossils found in the Rhynie chert, Rhynie, Scotland, which is of Early Devonian, specifically Pragian, age. The overall growth habit of the plant is difficult to construct. Some stems reached 2.5 mm in diameter, but their height is unknown; branching was possibly pseudomonopodial (i.e. one arm of a dichotomous branch continued as a 'main' stem). Uniquely among the Rhynie chert plants, aerial stems bore rigid hairs or spines made up of single cells. Stems appear to have grown from coiled (circinnate) tips, in a manner similar to modern ferns. Stems contained circular exarch xylem strands with tracheids showing both annular and spiral thickening. The upright spore-forming organs or sporangia were made up of two 'valves', the larger one facing away from the stem and bearing hairs, the smaller facing towards the stem and apparently not bearing hairs. The precise arrangement of the sporangia on the stems cannot be determined; there may have been zones of sporangia. Spores were released through a slit opening along the margins of the two valves of a sporangium. The trilete spores were about 55 ¬µm in diameter. Hairless stems bearing rhizoids but with a similar anatomy to the aerial stems are possibly the rhizomes of Trichopherophyton. Some actually grow through stems bearing hairs. Phylogeny The internal structure of stems and the presence of lateral two- valved sporangia are indicators of a relationship with the zosterophylls, although evidence is lacking for the distinct sporangial stalks which would be expected of this group. Zosterophylls which grew from coiled tips, like Trichopherophyton, also typically had a variety of outgrowths; however they had xylem which was elliptical in cross-section. Trichopherophyton thus spans the two major groups of zosterophylls identified by Niklas and Banks. Hao and Xue in 2013 listed the genus as a zosterophyll.

Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a Great Oregon, 515 U.S. 687 (1995), is a US Supreme Court case, decided by a 6-3 vote, in which the plaintiffs challenged the Interior Department's interpretation of the word \\"harm\\" in the Endangered Species Act (ESA).. Background The Secretary of the Interior and the director of the Fish and Wildlife Service director interpreted the word harm in the definition of take in Section 9 of the Endangered Species Act to mean an act that actually kills or injures wildlife. Under the statutory language of the Interior Department Regulation, the act may include significant habitat modification or degradation if it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding, or sheltering. The Interpretation of Section 9(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act, et seq. to provide the following protection for endangered species: *\\"Except as provided in sections 1535(g)(2) and 1539 of this title, with respect to any endangered species of fish or wildlife listed pursuant to section 1533 of this title it is unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to: ::(B) take any such species within the United States or the territorial sea of the United States. *Section 3(19) of the Act defines the statutory term take: ::\\"The term take means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct. The Act does not further define the terms it uses to define take. The Interior Department regulations that implement the statute, however, define the statutory term harm: *Harm in the definition of take in the Act means an act which actually kills or injures wildlife. Such act may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding, or sheltering.\\" Red-cockaded woodpecker Northern spotted owl The plaintiff was Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a Great Oregon, which consisted of various landowners, logging companies, and timber workers in the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast. It brought action against the Secretary of the Interior and the director of Fish and Wildlife Service to challenge the interpretation of the term take with regards to the clarification of harm in the Endangered Species Act. It argued that the red-cockaded woodpecker (Leuconotopicus borealis), an endangered species, and the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), a threatened species, had injured them economically by preventing them from conducting commercial business in the forestry industry. The defendant was the Fish and Wildlife Director, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's interpretation of the Act and his definition of the word harm. Issue The issue was if the interpretation of the word harm under section 9(a)(1) on takings of the Endangered Species Act includes habitat modification or destruction when it may kill or injure wildlife. More generally, the issue was if the statute applies to commercial businesses with the unintended attention directed towards endangered species. Lower courts The District Court found in favor of the Interior Department and found \\"that Congress intended an expansive interpretation of the word 'take,' an interpretation that encompasses habitat modification.\\" Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural ResourcesPalila v. Haw. Dep't of Land & Natural Resources, 471 F. Supp. 985 (D. Haw. 1979), aff'd, 639 F.2d 495 (9th Cir. 1981). was also noted as using the Secretary's decision to amend the ESA without using the opportunity to change the definition of take. Even if it had found the ESA to be \\"silent or ambiguous,\\" the Secretary's reasonable interpretation of the word harm was upheld. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. set the framework for judicial review to interpret statutes that are considered to be \\"silent or ambiguous.\\". The Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a Greater Oregon appealed. The Court of Appeals initially affirmed the judgment of the District Court, but after granting a rehearing, it found in favor of Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a Greater Oregon. Invoking the noscitur a sociis canon of statutory construction, which holds that a word is known by the company it keeps, the court concluded that harm, like the other words in the definition of take, should be read as applying only to the perpetrator's direct application of force against the animal taken. The Interior Department appealed. Decision =Majority opinion= The Supreme Court held, in a decision by Justice Stevens, that the definition of harm can include \\"significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife.\\" It gave three reasons for that being a reasonable interpretation: #The definition of the word harm does not specifically include whether harm has to be direct or indirect. The definition includes habitat modification, as defined in the context of the Act. #The holding in Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill. and the intent of the ESA were \\"to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction, whatever the cost.\\" Therefore, the Secretary's regulation addresses the intent of Congress's enactment of the statute. # In 1982, Congress granted authorization to the Secretary to issue permits under section 10 of the ESA for incidental takings. That included direct and indirect takings because the purpose of the permits would not be logical if only direct action were included under the word harm. =Concurring opinion= Justice O'Connor stated that significant habitat modification that interferes with \\"breeding, feeding, and sheltering\\" behaviors and leads to the injury or death of an animal protected by the Act qualifies as 'harm'. She further discussed proximate causation, which introduced notions of foreseeability. Harm applies to significant habitat modification, which foreseeably causes the actual injury or death to the red-cockaded woodpecker and the northern spotted owl, protected by the Act. =Scalia's dissent= Justice Scalia filed a dissent that included the argument that the regulation falls under Chevron deference, introduced by Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. Three reasons for the regulation not aligning with the interpretation of the statute were found. #There is no \\"chain of causality\\" between the time of habitat modification and the time of injury. The regulation also does not take into consideration the unforeseeable and unintended consequences of actions. #The definition of an \\"act\\" includes \\"an act or omission,\\" which was modified by the Fish and Wildlife Service in 1981, which the regulation does not state. #The definition of take is a \\"class of acts done directly and intentionally\\" to specific animals and not a population. The regulation includes unlawful injuries to populations of species. The dissent also includes the principle of noscitur a sociis, interpreting a list of words that share the same attribute just because the most of the words share an attribute. The word harm is the only word that does not include a direct action to injure or kill endangered species. Legacy The decision is significant because it demonstrated that \\"agencies cannot use cost as an excuse\\" for not complying with section 7(a)(2). Additionally, the court's ruling of the case falls under the \\"Secretary's definition of 'harm' within the Section 9 taking provision.\\" In Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, the major issue concerned the completion of a dam after discovering the critical habitat of the snail darter. The ESA was amended in 1978 to include the Endangered Species Committee, known as the \\"God Committee,\\" to provide exemptions to section 7. It denied an exemption, but a rider to a military appropriations bill exempted the Tellico Dam from the ESA. The case demonstrated the significance of habitat modification under the ESA and is the first case that defined the word harm under the definition of take, which applies to actions that have direct contact, minimal, or unforeseeable effects to endangered species. The definition of harm‚Äô' includes changes in habitat that affect endangered species.

The reigning batting champion of the Triple-A American Association, who received a one-month, 23-game trial with the 1956 St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball, Peete was projected by some as the leading candidate to be the Cardinals' 1957 starting center fielder.Schuster, Joe, Charlie Peete, Society for American Baseball Research Biography Project But he was killed in a commercial airplane crash near the Caracas, Venezuela, airport while flying to his winter-league baseball team in late November 1956; his wife, Nettie, and their three young children were also among the 25 victims of the crash.Jet Magazine, December 13, 1956  Early career  Nicknamed \\"Mule\\", Peete stood tall, weighed , batted left-handed and threw right-handed. The native of Franklin, Virginia, began his professional career in the Negro leagues with the Indianapolis Clowns and played semi- professional baseball in Canada before signing with the unaffiliated Portsmouth, Virginia, Merrimacs of the mid-level, Class B Piedmont League in 1953; Peete was the first African-American to play in that league since the baseball color line was broken in 1946. He batted .275 in 125 games played and the Cardinals drafted him into their organization that offseason and assigned him to their Lynchburg Cardinals farm team, also in the Piedmont League, for 1954. Peete batted .311 with 17 home runs and was named to the PL all-star team. He was promoted three levels to Triple-A for and batted .310 in a season split between the Cardinals' two top farm teams, the Rochester Red Wings and Omaha Cardinals. In 1956, he batted a league-best .350 with 16 home runs and 63 runs batted in in 116 games for Omaha.Minor league statistics from Baseball Reference  St. Louis Cardinals  Called up by the Cardinals in July, Peete made his debut July 17 in a home game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Pinch hitting for veteran Hank Sauer, he drew a walk and stayed in the game to play center field, and later grounded into a double play in a 4‚Äì2 Cardinal loss.1956-7-17 box score from Retrosheet.org Peete collected ten hits in 52 at bats with two doubles and two triples. He was sent back to Omaha after his last MLB appearance, August 16, when he went hitless in three at bats against Lew Burdette of the Milwaukee Braves.1956-8-16 box score from Retrosheet.org  Plane crash in Venezuela  Despite the disappointing results from his midseason callup, Peete was projected as a prime candidate for the Redbirds' 1957 centerfielder job; incumbent Bobby Del Greco had batted only .215 during 1956. Had Peete won the job, he would have been the Cardinals' first African- American regular starting player. To gain more experience, Peete decided to play winter baseball, and after drawing his release from a Cuban team because of a slow start, he joined the Valencia club in the Venezuelan league. Peete died at age 27; he and his family were on board Linea Aeropostal Flight 253 when the airliner crashed into Avila Mountain, near Caracas, during a rainstorm.Ten Americans dead in crash See also * List of baseball players who died during their careers References External links 1929 births 1956 deaths Accidental deaths in Venezuela African-American baseball players American expatriate baseball players in Canada Baseball players from Virginia Brandon Greys players Indianapolis Clowns players Lynchburg Cardinals players Major League Baseball center fielders Omaha Cardinals players People from Franklin, Virginia Portsmouth Merrimacs players Rochester Red Wings players St. Louis Cardinals players Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in 1956 Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in Venezuela ","title":"Charlie Peete"},{"id":"31243999","text":"Henry Tefft Clarke Sr. (April 26, 1834 - February 3, 1913) was an American businessman, pioneer, and politician from Nebraska.

It is native to low-elevation tropical monsoon forests of south east India. Some common names in English include rosewood, Bombay blackwood, roseta rosewood, East Indian rosewood, reddish-brown rosewood, Indian palisandre, and Java palisandre. Its Indian common names are beete, and satisal. The tree grows to 40 metres in height and is evergreen, but locally deciduous in drier subpopulations. Description and biology Pinnately compound leaves of Dalbergia latifolia growing in Java. The tree has grey bark that peels in long fibres, pinnately compound leaves, and bunches of small white flowers. It grows as both an evergreen and a deciduous tree in the deciduous monsoon forests of India making the tree very drought hardy. Haematonectria haematococca is a fungal pest of the tree, causing damage to the leaves and the heartwood in Javanese plantations. In India, trees may be subject to serious damage from a species of Phytophthora, a water mold genus. Germplasm resources for D. latifolia are maintained by the Kerala Forest Research Institute in Thrissur, Kerala, India. Uses A Dalbergia latifolia tree stands on roadside at Bogor, Java The tree produces a hard, durable, heavy wood that, when properly cured, is durable and resistant to rot and insects. It is grown as a plantation wood in both India and Java, often in dense, single species groves, to produce its highly desirable long straight bore. Wood from the tree is used in premium furniture making and cabinetry, guitar bodies and fretboards, exotic veneers, carvings, boats, skis, and for reforestation. Under the Indian Forest Act, 1927 the exportation of lumber products from wild harvested D. latifolia is illegal. There exists an international high demand and price for the wood due to its excellent qualities of having a long straight bore, its strength, and its high density. However, the tree is slow-growing; Javanese plantations were started in the late nineteenth century, but, due to its slow growth, plantations have not expanded beyond Java and India. Many once popular uses for D. latifolia wood have now been replaced with Dalbergia sissoo wood and engineered rosewood's, for economic purposes in cottage industries.

Hallin in his book The Uncensored War (1986) to explain the coverage of the Vietnam war. Hallin divides the world of political discourse into three concentric spheres: consensus, legitimate controversy, and deviance. In the sphere of consensus, journalists assume everyone agrees. The sphere of legitimate controversy includes the standard political debates, and journalists are expected to remain neutral. The sphere of deviance falls outside the bounds of legitimate debate, and journalists can ignore it. These boundaries shift, as public opinion shifts. Hallin's spheres, which deals with the media, are similar to the Overton window, which deals with public opinion generally, and posits a sliding scale of public opinion on any given issue ranging from conventional wisdom to unacceptable. Hallin used the concept of framing to describe the presentation and reception of issues in public. For example, framing the use of drugs as criminal activity can encourage the public to consider that behavior anti-social. Hallin also used the concept of an opinion corridor, in which the range of public opinion narrows, and opinion outside that corridor moves from legitimate controversy into deviance.  Description  = Sphere of consensus = This sphere contains those topics on which there is widespread agreement, or at least the perception thereof. Within the sphere of consensus, 'journalists feel free to invoke a generalized \\"we\\" and to take for granted shared values and shared assumptions'. Examples include such things as free speech, the abolition of slavery, or human rights. For topics in this sphere \\"journalists do not feel compelled to present an opposing view point or to remain disinterested observers.\\" = Sphere of legitimate controversy = For topics in this sphere rational and informed people hold differing views. These topics are therefore the most important to cover, and also ones upon which journalists are obliged to remain disinterested reporters, rather than advocating for or against a particular view. Schudson notes that Hallin, in his influential study of the US media during the Vietnam War, argues that journalism's commitment to objectivity has always been compartmentalized. That is, within a certain sphere‚Äîthe sphere of legitimate controversy‚Äîjournalists seek conscientiously to be balanced and objective. = Sphere of deviance = Topics in this sphere are rejected by journalists as being unworthy of general consideration. Such views are perceived as being either unfounded, taboo, or of such minor consequence that they are not news worthy. Hallin argues that in the sphere of deviance, 'journalists also depart from standard norms of objective reporting and feel authorized to treat as marginal, laughable, dangerous, or ridiculous individuals and groups who fall far outside a range of variation taken as legitimate.' For example, a person claiming that aliens are manipulating college basketball scores might have difficulty finding media coverage for such a claim.  Uses of the terms  Craig Watkins (2001, pp. 92‚Äì4) makes use of the Hallin's spheres in a paper examining ABC, CBS, and NBC television network television news coverage of the Million Man March, a demonstration that took place in Washington, DC on October 16, 1995. Watkins analyzes the dominant framing practices ‚Äì problem definition, rhetorical devices, use of sources, and images ‚Äì employed by journalists to make sense of this particular expression of political protest. He argues that Hallin's three spheres are a way for media framing practices to develop specific reportorial contexts, and each sphere develops its own distinct style of news reporting resources by different rhetorical tropes and discourses. Piers Robinson (2001, p. 536) uses the concept in relation to debate that have emerged over the extent to which the mass media serves elite interests or, alternatively, plays a powerful role in shaping political outcomes. His article reviews Hallin's spheres as an example of media-state relations, that highlights theoretical and empirical shortcomings in the 'manufacturing consent' thesis (Chomsky, McChesney). Robinson argues that a more nuanced and bi-directional understanding is needed of the direction of influence between media and the state that builds upon, rather than rejecting, existing theoretical accounts. Hallin's theory assumed a relatively homogenized media environment, where most producers were trying to reach most consumers. A more fractured media landscape can challenge this assumption. because different audiences may place topics in different spheres, a concept related to the filter bubble, which posits that many members of the public choose to limit their media consumption to the areas of consensus and deviance that they personally prefer.

A choice edible species, the fungus was originally described as new to science in 1998 by mycologists Gast√≥n Guzm√°n and Fidel Tapia from collections made in Veracruz, Mexico. Its distribution was later revealed to be far more widespread after several DNA studies suggested that it is common in the West Coast of the United States, Israel, Australia, and Cyprus. M. rufobrunnea grows in disturbed soil or in woodchips used in landscaping, suggesting a saprophytic mode of nutrition. Reports from the Mediterranean under olive trees (Olea europaea), however, suggest the fungus may also be able to form facultative tree associations. Young fruit bodies have conical, grayish caps covered with pale ridges and dark pits; mature specimens are yellowish to ochraceous-buff. The surface of the fruit body often bruises brownish orange to pinkish where it has been touched, a characteristic for which the fungus is named, the New Latin rufobrunnea signifying \\"rufus brown\\". Mature fruit bodies grow to a height of . M. rufobrunnea differs from other Morchella species by its urban or suburban habitat preferences, in the color and form of the fruit body, the lack of a sinus at the attachment of the cap with the stipe, the length of the pits on the surface, and the bruising reaction. A process to cultivate morels now known to be M. rufobrunnea was described and patented in the 1980s. Taxonomy The first scientifically described specimens of Morchella rufobrunnea were collected in June 1996 from the Ecological Institute of Xalapa and other regions in the southern Mexican municipality of Xalapa, Veracruz, which are characterized by a subtropical climate. The type locality is a mesophytic forest containing oak, sweetgum, Clethra and alder at an altitude of . In a 2008 study, Michael Kuo determined that the \\"winter fruiting yellow morel\\"‚Äîerroneously referred to as Morchella deliciosa‚Äîfound in landscaping sites in the western United States was the same species as M. rufobrunnea. According to Kuo, David Arora depicts this species in his popular 1986 work Mushrooms Demystified, describing it as a \\"coastal Californian form of Morchella deliciosa growing in gardens and other suburban habitats\\". Kuo suggests that M. rufobrunnea is the correct name for the M. deliciosa used by western American authors. Other North American morels formerly classified as deliciosa have since been recategorized into two distinct species, Morchella diminutiva and M. sceptriformis (=M. virginiana). Molecular analysis of nucleic acid sequences from the internal transcribed spacer and elongation factor EF-1Œ± regions suggests that the genus Morchella can be divided into three lineages. M. rufobrunnea belongs to a lineage that is basal to the esculenta clade (\\"yellow morels\\"), and the elata clade (\\"black morels\\"). This phylogenetic placement implies that it has existed in its current form since the Cretaceous era (roughly 145 to 66 million years ago), and all known morel species evolved from a similar ancestor. M. rufobrunnea is genetically closer to the yellow morels than the black morels. M. anatolica, described from Turkey in 2012, is a closely related sister species. The specific epithet rufobrunnea derives from the Latin roots ruf- (rufuous, reddish) and brunne- (brown). Vernacular names used for the fungus include \\"western white morel\\", \\"blushing morel\\", and‚Äîaccounting for the existence of subtropical species in the \\"blushing clade\\"‚Äî\\"red-brown blushing morel\\". Description Fruit bodies of M. rufobrunnea can reach tall, although most are typically found in a narrower range, . The conical to roughly cylindrical hymenophore (cap) is typically high by wide. Its surface is covered with longitudinal anastomosed ridges and crosswise veins that form broad, angular, elongated pits. Young fruit bodies are typically dark grey with sharply contrasting beige or buff ridges, while mature specimens fade to ochraceous-buff. The cylindrical stipe is often strongly wrinkled, enlarged at the base and measures by thick. It is typically covered with a dark brown to greyish pruinescence, often fading at maturity, a useful character to discriminate it from similar species, such as M. tridentina or M. sceptriformis. The stipe and hymenophore often exhibit ochraceous, orange or reddish stains, although this feature is neither constant nor exclusive to M. rufobrunnea and can be seen in a number of Morchella species, such as Morchella tridentina (=Morchella frustrata), M. esculenta, M. guatemalensis, the recently described M. fluvialis (Clowez et al. 2014), and most likely M. anatolica. In deposit, the spores are pale orange to yellowish orange. Ascospores are egg-shaped, measuring 20‚Äì24 by 14‚Äì16 Œºm when mature, but smaller (14.5‚Äì19 by 9‚Äì10 Œºm) in immature fruit bodies. They are thin-walled, hyaline (translucent), and inamyloid. The cylindrical asci (spore-bearing cells) are 300‚Äì360 by 16‚Äì20 Œºm with walls up to 1.5 Œºm thick. Paraphyses measure 90‚Äì184 by 10‚Äì18.5 Œºm (6‚Äì9 Œºm thick if immature); they are hyaline, have 1‚Äì2 (‚Äì3) septa in the lower half and slightly enlarged, subcapitate tips. The flesh is made of thin-walled, hyaline hyphae measuring 3‚Äì9 Œºm wide. The stipe is a textura globosa, with scattered or locally fasciculate, polymorphic terminal elements measuring 15‚Äì70 √ó 12‚Äì16 Œºm. Morchella rubobrunnea is an edible fungus; it has been described variously as \\"one of the tastiest members of the morel family\\", and alternately as \\"bland in comparison to other morel species\\". Individual specimens over have been reported. =Similar species= Morchella tridentina (=Morchella frustrata) is also rufescent and very similar to M. rufobrunnea. It is found in mountainous forests and maquis and forms a marked sinus at the attachment of the cap with the stem, which is pure white. At maturity, it develops more or less parallel, ladderlike interconnecting ridges. Microscopically, it often has moniliform paraphyses with septa extending in the upper half and has more regularly cylindrical or clavate 'hairs' on the stem, up to 100 Œºm long. M. guatemalensis, found in Central America, has a color ranging from yellow to yellowish-orange, but never grey, and it has a more distinct reddish to wine red bruising reaction. Microscopically, it has smaller paraphyses, measuring 56‚Äì103 by 6.5‚Äì13 Œºm. The New Guinean species M. rigidoides has smaller fruit bodies that are pale ochre to yellow, without any grey. Its pits are less elongated than those of M. rufobrunnea, and it has wider paraphyses, up to 30 Œºm. Morchella americana (=M. esculentoides), is widely distributed in North America, north of Mexico and has similar colours to mature fruit bodies of M. rufobrunnea, but lacks the bruising reaction. M. diminutiva, found in hardwood forests of eastern North America, has a smaller fruit body than M. rufobrunnea, up to tall and up to wide at its widest point. Morchella sceptriformis (=Morchella virginiana) is found in riparian and upland ecosystems from Virginia to northern Mississippi, usually in association with the American tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera). Habitat and distribution A predominantly saprophytic species, Morchella rufobrunnea fruit bodies grow singly or in clusters in disturbed soil or woodchips used in landscaping. Large numbers can appear the year after wood mulch has been spread on the ground. Typical disturbed habitats include fire pits, near compost piles, logging roads, and dirt basements. Fruiting usually occurs in the spring, although fruit bodies can be found in these habitats most of the year. In Cyprus, the fungus is frequently reported from coastal, urban and suburban areas under olive trees (Olea europaea). Morchella rufobrunnea ranges from Mexico through California and Oregon in the United States. It has also been introduced to central Michigan from California. It is one of seven Morchella species that have been recorded in Mexico. In 2009, Israeli researchers used molecular genetics to confirm the identity of the species in northern Israel, where it was found growing in gravelly disturbed soil near a newly paved path at the edge of a grove. This was the first documented appearance of the fungus outside the American continent. Unlike North American populations that typically fruit for only a few weeks in spring, the Israeli populations have a long-season ecotype, fruiting from early November to late May (winter and spring). This period corresponds to the rainy season in Israel (October to May), with low to moderate temperatures ranging from during the day and at night. Cultivation A collection of mature specimens from San Francisco, US Morchella rufobrunnea is the morel that is cultivated commercially per US patents 4594809 and 4757640. This process was developed in 1982 by Ronald Ower with what he thought was Morchella esculenta; M. rufobrunnea had not yet been described. The cultivation protocol consists of preparing a spawn culture that is mixed with nutrient-poor soil. This mixture is laid on nutrient-rich soil and kept sufficiently moist until fruiting. In the nutrient-poor substrate, the fungus forms sclerotia‚Äîhardened masses of mycelia that serve as food reserves. Under appropriate environmental conditions, these sclerotia grow into morels. The fruit bodies of Morchella rufobrunnea have been cultivated under controlled conditions in laboratory- scale experiments. Primordia, which are tiny nodules from which fruit bodies develop, appeared two to four weeks after the first watering of pre-grown sclerotia incubated at a temperature of and 90% humidity. Mature fruit bodies grew to long. The early stages of fruit body development can be divided into four discrete stages. In the first, disk-shaped knots measuring appear on the surface of the substrate. As the knot expands in size, a primordial stipe emerges from its center. The stipe lengthens, orients upward, and two types of hyphal elements develop: long, straight and smooth basal hairy hyphae and short stipe hyphae, some of which are inflated and project out of a cohesive layer of tightly packed hyphal elements. In the final stage, which occurs when the stipe is long, immature caps appear that have ridges and pits with distinct filament-like paraphyses. Extracellular mucilage that covers the ridge layer imparts shape and rigidity to the tissue and probably protects it against dehydration.

It is located off Hohe Stra√üe in the district of Innenstadt, and set between the two squares of Rathausplatz and Alter Markt. It houses part of the city government, including the city council and offices of the Lord Mayor.Most of the city administration has been moved to the so-called Stadthaus (i.e. city house) in Deutz. It is Germany's oldest city hall with a documented history spanning some 900 years. The history of its council during the 11th century is a prominent example for self-gained municipal autonomy of Medieval cities.Hermann Jakobs: Verfassungstopographische Studien zur K√∂lner Stadtgeschichte des 10. bis 12. Jahrhunderts, K√∂ln, 1971, p. 49-123 Today's building complex consists of several structures, added successively in varying architectural styles: they include the 14th century historic town hall, the 15th century Gothic style tower, the 16th century Renaissance style loggia and cloister (the L√∂wenhof), and the 20th century Modern Movement atrium (the Piazzetta). The so-called Spanischer Bau is an extension on Rathausplatz but not directly connected with the main building.  History  Cologne City Hall around 1900; the Loggia visible in the centre, Saalbau in centre right and Tower in the background. The City Hall is located on the site of the former Ancient Roman Praetorium, which until the year 475 was seat of the Roman Governor of Germania Inferior. Merovingian kings are known to have used the praetorium as a regia until 754, however the building was ultimately destroyed by an earthquake in the late 8th century.Ulrich Krings and Walter Geis: K√∂ln: Das gotische Rathaus und seine historische Umgebung, J.P. Bachem Verlag, K√∂ln, 2000 Under Hildebold of Cologne, the city was elevated from a bishop's to an archbishop's see in 795, and the area around the former praetorium has become home to both a group of wealthy Patrician merchants and Cologne's Jewish community ‚Äì many of whom under immunity of the king. With Emperor Otto I's younger brother Bruno the Great becoming archbishop in 953, the Ottonian dynasty established a secular government by an ecclesiastic archbishop. This abundance of power in Medieval Europe was in stark confrontation to the emerge of emancipating burghers: armed conflicts in 1074Annals of Lambert of Hersfeld: The 1074 uprising against Anno II and 1096 were followed by the formation of a commune and first municipal structures as a basis for urban autonomy. In order to consolidate their economic and political rights, Cologne burghers established fraternities and trade guilds (most notably the Richerzeche). In the 1106 war of succession between Emperor Henry V and his father Emperor Henry IV, they took deliberate opposition to the archbishop, after which they gained benefit in regards to the city's territorial expansion over the following years. As ‚Äì at the time ‚Äì one of Europe's busiests trading ports and largest city in Germany, the population of Cologne gradually changed from a mainly feudal society to free citizens. Documents from the years 1135 and 1152, recorded \\"a house in which citizen convene\\",from Latin: \\"domus in quam cives conveniunt\\" referring to the first established council hall, at the location of today's town hall. The coat of arms of Cologne, first mentioned in 1114, is Europe's oldest municipal coat of arms. By 1180, the citizens of Cologne won a legal battle against Philip I, Archbishop of Cologne, for another extension of Cologne's city walls. With the Battle of Worringen fought in 1288, Cologne became independent from the Electorate and on 9. September 1475 officially gained Imperial immediacy as a free imperial city. In 1388 Pope Urban VI signed the charter for the University of Cologne, Europe's first university to have been established by citizenry. On 14. September 1396 the constitution of Cologne came into effect and the Cologne gaffs and guilds (Gaffeln and Z√ºnfte) assumed power in the council. Following the tradition of Roman consuls, the council was headed by two elected Burgomasters (Mayors) until the year 1797, when council and constitution were replaced by the Napoleonic and later code civil. Since 1815 the city council is led by one Oberb√ºrgermeister (Lord Mayor). During the bombing the entire city hall was destroyed except for the front portion and part of the tower, the remaining part being rebuilt in modern style.  Buildings and building components  = Historic Town Hall = The oldest part of today's City Hall is the so- called Saalbau (i.e. roofed hall building), which replaced a previous Romanesque style council building of 1135 on the same location. The Saalbau dates back to 1330 and is named after the Hansasaal, a 30,0 by 7,6 metres large and up to 9,58 metres tall assembly hall and core of the entire Rathaus. The hall is named after the Hanseatic League, which held an important summit in it on 19. November 1367. Noteworthy are stone figures of the Nine Worthies, the Emperor and the Privileges. = Tower = Cologne Senate of 1655 Commissioned by the Cologne guilds on 19 August 1406, the Gothic-style Ratsturm (Council tower) was built between 1407 and 1414 and reaches a height of 61 metres. It consists of five storeys and the so-called Ratskeller (Council cellar). Its purpose was mainly to store documents, but one of the lower floors also housed the Senatssaal (i.e. hall of the Cologne Senate). While being heavily damaged during the bombing of Cologne in World War II, the tower ‚Äì including the many exterior stone figures ‚Äì has been restored entirely. Curiously, beneath the statue of Konrad von Hochstaden, there is a grotesque male character performing autofellatio. Four times daily, a carillon (German: Glockenspiel)City of Cologne: Das Glockenspiel im Rathausturm is played by the tower's bells. = Loggia = The Rathauslaube ‚Äì as the Renaissance style Loggia is called ‚Äì is a replacement of a previous loggia on the same location. The council initiated a lengthy design process in 1557, which lasted until 1562. In July 1567 the council approved the design by Wilhelm Vernukken from Kalkar to be built, with construction lasting from 1569 to 1573.Isabelle Kirgus: Die Rathauslaube in K√∂ln (1569‚Äì1573), Bouvier, Bonn, 2003 The loggia consists of a 2-storey, five-bay long and two-bay deep arcade, which functions as entrance to the councils main hall (Hansasaal) at ground level, and as balcony for the main hall on the upper floor. The balcony was used for public speeches throughout the year. = Piazzetta = View of Saalbau from the Piazzetta Likened to a small piazza with various building making up the perimeter walls, the 900 square metre large and 12,6 metres tall atrium was built during the postwar restoration of the historic town hall. = Spanischer Bau = Built on the North-western side of Rathausplatz in the years 1608 to 1615, the city council commissioned the originally Dutch Renaissance style building for meetings and celebrations. The name emerged in reference to Spanish delegates at the building during the time of the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648), however was not in official use before the 19th century. After having been heavily damaged in 1942, the building was completely rebuilt in 1953.

It was written by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and co-sponsored by John Cornyn (R-TX) and Arlen Specter (D-PA). Primarily, the bill would allow the Department of Justice to press civil charges against file-sharers and award restitution to the copyright owner. This is the third time similar legislation has gone through the United States Senate without passing. Background In 1997, the No Electronic Theft Act (NET Act) allowed prosecutors to press criminal charges against those found to be infringing copyright. Since its inception, the federal government has been hesitant to press charges, even in cases such as Capitol v. Thomas due to the difficulty of making criminal charges stick. Additionally, the Department of Justice has noted that arresting file-sharing teens is not a priority. Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Hewitt Pate was quoted as saying, \\"The Justice Department is there to enforce the law, there's something to be said for those who help themselves.\\" In March 2004, Attorney General John Ashcroft formed an Intellectual Rights Taskforce that aimed to address the growing concerns of intellectual property law and copyright in the emerging digital landscape. Ashcroft was urged by numerous congressmen to tackle the growing number of file-sharers within the United States. The goals of the Taskforce were to promote legislation and implement various means of preventing intellectual property theft. Also in 2004, Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the Protecting Intellectual Rights Against Theft and Expropriation Act of 2004, or the PIRATE Act. The bill proposed for the Department of Justice to partake in civil suits against file-sharers on behalf of copyright holders. The goal was to lessen the requirements needed for a criminal suit, as seen in the NET Act. The bill failed to pass in the United States House of Representatives and faced controversy for allowing the copyright holders to press their own charges in addition to the civil charges, which would enable the file-sharer to face persecution twice. Leahy and Hatch also proposed the INDUCE Act a few months after the PIRATE Act, which also failed to pass in the House. Text of the Bill =United States Code= The bill makes specific amendments to title 17 of the United States Code which addresses copyright law. The bill allows civil penalties for violations of section 506 of title 17. Restitution shall be determined by section 504, and equivalent to the amount that would be determined by section 3663(a)(1)(B) of title 18. The penalty would be offset by any award of damages filed in a civil suit subsequent to the initial case. Section 509, which addresses forfeiture, destruction, and restitution would be repealed. Crime and criminal punishment outlined in title 18 includes numerous small amendments to section 1834, which adds section 2323 to give additional coverage on forfeiture, destruction, and restitution. The section notes that property prohibited under sections 506 or 1204 of title 17, and 2318, 2319, 2319A, 2319B, or 2320, or chapter 90 of title 18 are subject to forfeiture as well as destruction after court proceedings. Restitution is mandatory to the victim should a conviction be issued. The bill also creates a stronger Federal Bureau of Investigation presence by establishing a unit to work with the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property section of the Department of Justice that would have at least 2 agents investigating each case. It also constructs an annual program that FBI agents would be required to attend in order to handle issues of compromised intellectual property. The FBI would also allot one agent to each Hong Kong and Budapest to assist in the program. The budget for these implementations totaled $12 million. An additional $10 million was allotted to both the Director of the FBI and the Attorney General for the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice for training, tools, and investigative causes. =The Trademark Act of 1946= Changes to this bill included additional protection to seized records of copyright and trademark to ensure that any confidential information is not given out. Lobbying The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) is one of the largest lobbyers for pro-copyright law in the United States. In 2007, the RIAA spent $2 million on lobbying in support of tougher copyright laws. The RIAA is also a member of the Copyright Alliance, which aims to support those who work in the creative industries. Some of the largest groups that lobbied for the bill included: * Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) * Sony Corporation * Magazine Publishers of America * Vivendi * Warner Music Group * Microsoft Corp * National Music Publishers Association * News Corp * General Electric * Songwriters Guild of America * Time Warner * United States Chamber of Commerce * Walt Disney Corporation * Verizon Communications * Johnson & Johnson Many smaller organizations from various industries, such as pharmaceuticals, software, car manufacturing, and telecommunications, also supported the bill. File-sharing and P2P networks like Bearshare, Grokster, and Morpheus lobbied against the bill with the help of lobbying firm P2P United. In 2003, the executive director of the group, Adam Eisgrau stated, \\"It is long past time for the 'Tyrannosaurical' recording industry to stop blaming and suing its customers to cover up the industry's own glaring failures to adapt yet again to a new technology, one that should have already been making millions for it, and for the average artist.\\" During this time, he also noted that many P2P sharing sites were willing to collaborate with entertainment industries to find a better solution to the problem. Controversy The bill was criticized for its support of copyright holders, since it allows the Justice Department to fight on their behalf. It also eradicates the burden of proof required in criminal cases, making a suit less of a risk to the government while taking away the need for the holder to pursue their own litigation. Senator Leahy was also criticized in 2004 for receiving $178,000 in contributions from entertainment forces. As of 2010, Senator Leahy still obtains a majority of his funding from entertainment and computing industries. Related Legislation In July 2007, Representative Steve Chabot (R-OH) proposed the Intellectual Property Enhanced Criminal Enforcement Act of 2007, or H.R.3155, with the co-sponsorship of Representatives Phil English (R-PA), Jim Gerlach (R-PA) and Marilyn N. Musgrave (R-CO). In August 2007, it was sent to the House Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security where it did not pass. This bill also intended to amend titles 17 and 18 of United States Code. In 2008, the United States Government finally found success with the PRO-IP Act, which combines elements of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Act of 2007 and other previous legislation.

California Death Index, 1940-1997. Sacramento, CA, USA: State of California Department of Health Services, Center for Health Statistics. History Francis Carlyle was born Francis Xavier Finneran. He was born in Fall River, Massachusetts and lived most of his life in New York, living at one time in Greenwich Village. He was well known and regarded by his peers, contributing his tricks to several books on magic. He was a regular and popular performer at Hollywood's Magic Castle in their close-up room, specializing in card and coin magic. He also performed at notable clubs such as the Stork Club in New York. Later (at least from 1964), problems with alcohol made it difficult for him to continue professionally performing magic, and eventually to be barred from performing at the Magic Castle.

He participated at the 1988 Summer Olympics, winning a bronze medal in 200 metre backstroke. He also competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Background The 21-year-old went into the 1988 Olympic Games the 20th fastest backstroker in the world over 200m. He qualified for the final and raced in lane one. Kingsman's time earned him a bronze medal in the final few strokes. His time of 2:00.48, which set a new Commonwealth record, is currently the longest standing national record in New Zealand swimming at 20 years (broken in 2008 by Kent Basset). Kingsman was New Zealand's first male Olympic medalist in an individual swimming event. Over his swimming career, in addition to his Olympic medal, Kingsman also earned four Commonwealth Games medals and twelve New Zealand national senior titles. Kingsman was trained during his entire New Zealand career by coach Hilton Brown. When he was 15, he qualified for the 1982 Commonwealth Games team, making the 200m final at Brisbane, Queensland. At the time, he was the youngest Kiwi to ever compete in the Commonwealth Games. At age 17, he joined Gary Hurring in representing New Zealand at the 1984 Summer Olympics swimming backstroke, and he finished tenth in the 100m. By the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, Kingsman's performances bettered enough to earn him two silver medals, in the 100m and 200m backstroke. That year, he also earned a scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley, where his swimming developed a sharply competitive edge under the tutelage of coach Nort Thornton. Kingsman closed his career by taking a bronze and a silver in the 1990 Commonwealth Games in his home town of Auckland, New Zealand. He was always an exceedingly popular competitor, and his farewell at those Games in Auckland was an emotional occasion. In the 1990 Queen's Birthday Honours, Kingsman was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to swimming. On retiring from swimming, Kingsman took up a position as New Zealand national sales and marketing manager for Speedo sportswear. He then set up and operated his own swim school in Auckland. In 2001, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife and son and currently lives in Greenville, South Carolina, where Kingsman is a financial advisor and also a professional motivational speaker and executive coach to the financial services industry.

Borrowers transfer ownership of their car, van or motorcycle to the logbook lender as security for a loan. While making repayments borrowers keep possession of their vehicle and continue to use it. When the logbook loan is repaid, the borrower regains ownership of their vehicle.https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/logbook-loans Borrowers hand the logbook lender the V5C registration document - or \\"logbook\\" - but this is purely symbolic and has no legal effect. If the borrower defaults, the logbook lender can seize the vehicle and look to the proceeds of sale for satisfaction of the loan. Unlike a car title loan in the United States, the logbook lender can, under English law, seize the vehicle without a court order. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, logbook loans are regulated by the Bills of Sale Act 1878 and Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882. FCA compliant logbook lenders utilise your vehicle as security using a Bill of Sale, granting temporary ownership during the term of an agreed loan. However, the Bills of Sale Act (1878) has no jurisdiction in Scotland, and very few lenders are able to give loans. As a solution, a small pick of lenders have managed to lead the way forward in delivering logbook loan services to Scottish residents.

The question concerns subsets of the natural numbers, typically denoted by mathbb{N} , called additive bases. A subset B is called an (asymptotic) additive basis of finite order if there is some positive integer h such that every sufficiently large positive integer n can be written as the sum of at most h elements of B. For example, the natural numbers are themselves an additive basis of order 1, since every natural number is trivially a sum of at most one natural number. It is a non-trivial theorem of Lagrange (Lagrange's four-square theorem) that the set of positive square numbers is an additive basis of order 4. Another highly non-trivial and celebrated result along these lines is Vinogradov's theorem. One is naturally inclined to ask whether these results are optimal. It turns out that Lagrange's four-square theorem cannot be improved, as there are infinitely many positive integers which are not the sum of three squares. This is because no positive integer which is the sum of three squares can leave a remainder of 7 when divided by 8. However, one should perhaps expect that a set B which is about as sparse as the squares (meaning that in a given interval [1,N], roughly N^{1/2} of the integers in [1,N] lie in B ) which does not have this obvious deficit should have the property that every sufficiently large positive integer is the sum of three elements from B . This follows from the following probabilistic model: suppose that N/2 < n leq N is a positive integer, and x_1, x_2, x_3 are 'randomly' selected from B cap [1,N] . Then the probability of a given element from B being chosen is roughly 1/N^{1/2} . One can then estimate the expected value, which in this case will be quite large. Thus, we \`expect' that there are many representations of n as a sum of three elements from B , unless there is some arithmetic obstruction (which means that B is somehow quite different than a \`typical' set of the same density), like with the squares. Therefore, one should expect that the squares are quite inefficient at representing positive integers as the sum of four elements, since there should already be lots of representations as sums of three elements for those positive integers n that passed the arithmetic obstruction. Examining Vinogradov's theorem quickly reveals that the primes are also very inefficient at representing positive integers as the sum of four primes, for instance. This begets the question: suppose that B , unlike the squares or the prime numbers, is very efficient at representing positive integers as a sum of h elements of B . How efficient can it be? The best possibility is that we can find a positive integer h and a set B such that every positive integer n is the sum of at most h elements of B in exactly one way. Failing that, perhaps we can find a B such that every positive integer n is the sum of at most h elements of B in at least one way and at most S(h) ways, where S is a function of h . This is basically the question that Paul Erd≈ës and P√°l Tur√°n asked in 1941. Indeed, they conjectured a negative answer to this question, namely that if B is an additive basis of order h of the natural numbers, then it cannot represent positive integers as a sum of at most h too efficiently; the number of representations of n , as a function of n , must tend to infinity. History The conjecture was made jointly by Paul Erd≈ës and P√°l Tur√°n in 1941. In the original paper, they state \\"(2) If f(n) > 0 for n > n_0 , then varlimsup_{n rightarrow infty} f(n) = infty \\" Here f(n) is the number of ways one can write the natural number n as the sum of two (not necessarily distinct) elements of B. If f(n) is always positive for sufficiently large n, then B is called an additive basis (of order 2). This problem has attracted significant attention but remains unsolved. In 1964, Erd≈ës published a multiplicative version of this conjecture.P. Erd√µs: On the multiplicative representation of integers, Israel J. Math. 2 (1964), 251--261 Progress While the conjecture remains unsolved, there have been some advances on the problem. First, we express the problem in modern language. For a given subset B subset mathbb{N} , we define its representation function r_B(n) = #{(a_1, a_2) in B^2  a_1 + a_2 = n }. Then the conjecture states that if r_B(n) > 0 for all n sufficiently large, then limsup_{n rightarrow infty} r_B(n) = infty . More generally, for any h in mathbb{N} and subset B subset mathbb{N} , we can define the h representation function as r_{B,h}(n) = #{(a_1, cdots, a_h) in B^h  a_1 + cdots + a_h = n }. We say that B is an additive basis of order h if r_{B,h}(n) > 0 for all n sufficiently large. One can see from an elementary argument that if B is an additive basis of order h, then displaystyle n leq sum_{m=1}^n r_{B,h}(m) leq B cap [1,n]^h So we obtain the lower bound n^{1/h} leq B cap [1,n] . The original conjecture spawned as Erd≈ës and Tur√°n sought a partial answer to Sidon's problem (see: Sidon sequence). Later, Erd≈ës set out to answer the following question posed by Sidon: how close to the lower bound B cap [1,n] geq n^{1/h} can an additive basis B of order h get? This question was answered in the case h=2 by Erd≈ës in 1956. Erd≈ës proved that there exists an additive basis B of order 2 and constants c_1, c_2 > 0 such that c_1 log n leq r_B(n) leq c_2 log n for all n sufficiently large. In particular, this implies that there exists an additive basis B such that r_B(n) = n^{1/2 + o(1)} , which is essentially best possible. This motivated Erd≈ës to make the following conjecture If B is an additive basis of order h, then limsup_{n rightarrow infty} r_B(n)/log n > 0. In 1986, Eduard Wirsing proved that a large class of additive bases, including the prime numbers, contains a subset that is an additive basis but significantly thinner than the original. In 1990, Erd≈ës and Prasad V. Tetali extended Erd≈ës's 1956 result to bases of arbitrary order. In 2000, V. Vu proved that thin subbases exist in the Waring bases using the Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood circle method and his polynomial concentration results. In 2006, Borwein, Choi, and Chu proved that for all additive bases B, f(n) eventually exceeds 7.

Also, a state should not necessarily be considered an \\"Unrechtsstaat,\\" even if it does not correspond with the model of a classical civil Rechtsstaat and in particular the German concept of a Rechtsstaat.Sendler, ZRP 1993, 1 ff., 3 On the other hand, the term \\"Unrechtsstaat\\" does not exclude the possibility of instances in which such a state has areas where qualities characteristic of a Rechtsstaat are dominant and where justices is realized in practice.Sendler, NJ, 1991, 379 ff., 380 In contrast to this notion of an Unrechtsstaat, Gerd Roellecke holds that the differentiating quality of an Unrechtsstaat is that it does not expect the equality of all people. In contrast with historical \\"Nichtrechtstaaten\\" (non-Rechstaaten), Unrechtstaaten have the capacity to be Rechstaaten after a period of historical development. The German public is divided on whether to call the German Democratic Republic (GDR) as an example of Unrechtsstaat. Those scholars, however, who view it as such maintain that it is an accurate designation because the state was not based on the rule of law and was unjust. It is also cited that the traditional and commemorative practices and framings sanctioned by the German government depict GDR as Unrechtsstaat as well as a dictatorship. An Unrechtsstaat may be distinguished from a Verbrecherstaat or 'criminal state', where all the institutions of the state have been seized by a criminal enterprise; such that, while maintaining the nomenclature and appearance of state action, governmental institutions become wholly perverted to serve criminal purposes. The German Federal Constitutional Court, in a series of judgements in the 1950s, established the principle that Nazi Germany should be considered to have been a Verbrecherstaat, such that all German governmental institutions, organisations and public servants had been wholly perverted into 'a power apparatus in the service of the Nazi Party'. A Verbrecherstaat is not a valid state at all; whereas an Unrechtsstaat is a valid state that nominally acknowledges the rule of law, but nevertheless systematically fails to maintain it.

The three Moral Stories This is not a story, Madame de La Carli√®re and the Suppl√©ment au voyage de Bougainville together make up a trilogy of moral stories written in 1772 that partially appeared in the Correspondance litt√©raire in 1773. The intention of Diderot himself was for the three stories to be considered together: \\"le troisi√®me conte donnera son sens aux deux premiers\\" (the third story will give meaning to the first two), he tells the reader. This intention is confirmed by the initial title of Madame de La Carli√®re, Second conte (French for Second story), and by the allusions to characters or developments of one of the stories in another. Subsequently, though, the editors did not respect this material and intellectual unity and the texts were edited separately. Jacques-Andr√© Naigeon himself published the three texts in his edition of the complete works of Diderot (1796), but separated the Suppl√©ment au voyage de Bougainville from the two other texts. It seems coherent to consider les Deux Amis de Bourbonne, another short story by Diderot, in the same vein as these three stories: the piece takes place during the same era and the themes and the style are similar.C'est en tous cas l'option prise par Laurent Versini dans son √©dition des ≈íuvres de Diderot. Summary There are two different stories in This is not a story. The first recounts the story of Tani√©, who is in love with a venal and greedy woman, Madame Reymer. Tani√© goes off to Saint-Domingue for ten years to make a fortune for her. Madame Reymer takes advantage of his absence and finds other lovers. When Tani√© comes back from his voyage, he lives with Madame Reymer for around five years. Then, Monsieur de Maurepas proposes that he leave to do business with the North, which Tani√© accepts to take on because he knows that Madame Reymer is only with him for his fortune. He dies of a fever some days after he departs. In the second story, Diderot recounts the history of Gardeil and Mademoiselle de la Chaux. Out of love for him, Mademoiselle de la Chaux abandons all ‚Äî her honor, her fortune, her family ‚Äî to be with Gardeil. Somehow or other, they live happily. Gardeil, a translator by trade, works until he is no longer able. His wife helps him by learning Greek, Hebrew and other languages. She gives herself, body and soul, to make him happy, but one day he leaves her because she is no longer useful to him. She takes it very badly, but recovers some years later. She enrolls in the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and then writes a book (Les Trois Favorites, French for The Three Favorites), which she sends to the Marquise de Pompadour, a fervent admirer of good prose. She is invited to Versailles, but rejects this meeting and never ends up going. She ends her life in misery. Diderot concludes his book in saying that to judge someone based on one single character trait is going a bit fast, but that there is a lot of truth in generalities. Analysis The title of Ceci n'est pas un conte, followed by Second conte (whose name completely contradicts the first title), betrays Diderot's game of denotation played against connotation. He plays with perceptions of reality and appearances, truth and falsity, as well as good, bad and the relativity of these notions. The Suppl√©ment au voyage de Bougainville, which evokes the morality of a civilisation from the end of the world, appears much like the keystone that confirms the importance of reflecting on the relationship between morality and guilt. Likewise to that of the painting The Treachery of Images by Ren√© Magritte, Diderot wants to tell us that a person's behavior is not in itself moral or immoral. Morality is not universal and therefore it is not revealed either.Ce qui annonce une des th√©matiques de l'Entretien d'un philosophe avec la mar√©chale de * qui sera r√©dig√© un an plus tard.

It is a pie which consists of offal within a huff paste casing. It was thought to originate from the 15th century, but fell out of fashion several times. It was first rediscovered in the 1950s and 60s, and again in 2006. Some modern recipes have replaced the majority of the offal with other proteins. History Probably created in the 15th century, the Devizes Pie consists of offal, such as calf head, cooked in a case of hard huff paste. It is associated with the town of Devizes, Wiltshire. The details of the dish had supposedly been lost for generations‚Äîalthough it appears in a recipe book of 1830‚Äîuntil a recipe was discovered in the 1960s and the dish was then served in the Bear Hotel in Devizes for several years. After falling out of fashion again, it was revived in 2006 as part of the Devizes Food and Drink Festival. In 2009 it was claimed to ease the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome due to the high quantities of nucleotides in the offal. A recipe published in The Times in 1956 specified the main ingredients as thin slices from a boiled calf's head with the brains and tongue cut into strips, as well as slices of cold cooked bacon and lamb, and rounds of hard-boiled eggs. (citing The Times, 19 November 1956) More recent recipes have limited the offal to tongue, and replaced the other proteins with stewing lamb, lean veal, sliced ham and bacon. The dish was featured by Terry Wogan during his television series The Great British Food Trip in 2015, when he sampled it at the Black Swan in Devizes.

Edlich (January 19, 1939, New York City, New York ‚Äì December 25, 2013, Brush Prairie, Washington) was a Professor Emeritus of Plastic Surgery, Biomedical Engineering and Emergency Medicine at the University of Virginia Health System. His basic clinical and research interests are focused on improving the safety and outcome of wound care in emergency medicine and surgery. Biography He was admitted to Lafayette College at age 15, after finishing his sophomore year at Stuyvesant High School in New York City. Three years later, he enrolled as an early admission student at New York University School of Medicine. After graduating from there in 1970, he began a surgical residency at the University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, and received a Doctor of Philosophy in Surgery. Academic career After Edlich completed his 8-year residency training at the University of Minnesota Hospital, he selected a 2-year plastic surgical residency at the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center. During his time at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, both in his residency and subsequent career, he published hundreds of publications and book chapters on burn care, wound healing, surgical instrument design, and rehabilitation. =Emergency medicine= He accepted a position as director of an emergency room at the University of Virginia, where he made several advances in emergency care: an emergency medical communication system for ambulances, emergency training for ambulance attendants, a rape crisis center, a crisis center for the deaf, a poison control center, an advanced life support emergency medical system, and the first medical air transport system in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Edlich was selected as one of the eight physician technical advisors for the Department of Emergency Medical Services in the Department of Health Education and Welfare to develop emergency medical systems throughout the US. He supervised the development of emergency medical systems in the Commonwealth of Virginia, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, Washington DC, and Puerto Rico. In 1979, Edlich received the Distinguished Public Service Award for Contributions to Emergency Medicine by the US Public Health Service. Professional accomplishments  In his studies of the biology of wound repair and infection, he designed the first adhesive skin closure tape that could approximate the wound edges without the use of sutures. He developed a skin wound cleanser safe enough to be poured into the patient's eye without toxic effects, a solution of poloxamer 188 that has now been approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is now marketed as Shur-Clens by ConvaTec (Skillman, New Jersey). Realizing the drawbacks of the Bovie electrical generator for electrosurgery, Edlich developed the first compact electrosurgical unit. =Endoscopy= After Edlich learned about endoscopes in Asia, he received an endoscope for gastroscopic visualization of the patient's stomach. As a surgical resident, Edlich was the first physician to do gastroscopy at the University of Minnesota Medical Center. Edlich's picture was featured on the cover of Postgraduate Medicine, the Journal of Applied Medicine, in November, 1968. His experiences with gastroscopy led to the first minimally invasive surgical procedure at the University of Minnesota Hospital, an endoscopic gastrostomy. Edlich soon realized the limitations of the thick, narrow-diameter latex Ewald tubes that were being used to evacuate blood clots from the patient's stomach before endoscopic examination. Edlich devised a thin-walled, transparent, plastic tube for evacuation of blood clots from a patient's stomach. =Ischemic myocardium= Edlich helped to quantitate the perfusion of a saphenous vein graft implanted in canine ischemic myocardium using tissue blood flow measurements. When his studies failed to show revascularization of the heart, he suggested that the revascularization of the heart could be improved by a coronary artery bypass graft. =Burn and wound healing center= Edlich's interest in emergency medical care was complemented by his clinical experience in burn care. After accepting the position as Director of University of Virginia Burn Center, which initially consisted of only two beds, he enlisted the help of benefactors as well as the University of Virginia to develop the 16-bed DeCamp Burn and Wound Healing Center, which included a hyperbaric oxygen treatment system for patients with necrotizing fasciitis and purpura fulminans. He helped to devise a new silver sulfadiazine cream containing poloxamer 188 that exhibits less tissue toxicity than that of the commercially available silver sulfadiazine cream. Edlich devised a new Gram stain technique for quantitative bacteriology using stable iodophors rather than unstable aqueous iodine. This reliable Gram stain technique is now being used throughout the world. When Edlich treated burn patients in which the patient's ignited clothing was adherent to the burned skin, he was concerned that the adult textiles were highly flammable and became the ignition source for the burn injury. His clinical measurements of fabric flammability of the textiles as well as a careful review of the ignition source documented that flammable liquids, such as gasoline, were the ignition sources of most burn injuries. Consequently, Edlich initiated a nationwide educational program that has dramatically reduced the frequency of burn injuries stemming from flammable liquids. =Surgical gloves= During his surgical career, Edlich and his team of scientists made important scientific contributions that have protected health care workers as well as operating room personnel. His studies on the toxicity of corn starch became a catalyst for the development of powder-free gloves. His scientific investigation proved conclusively that cornstarch was a dangerous foreign body that potentiated wound infection and was a vector for the latex allergy epidemic. On September 24, 2008, Edlich and 11 health professionals submitted a Citizen's Petition to the FDA to ban cornstarch on medical gloves (FDA-2008-P-0531). On February 3, 2011, the FDA prepared a Federal Register on the safety and performance of medical gloves with cornstarch, in which healthcare professionals had 60 days to make comments that ultimately led to the FDA's final decision regarding banning cornstarch on medical gloves. Edlich's recent studies on a new powder- free double-glove puncture indication system support the use of this double- glove system in surgical procedures in an effort to prevent the spread of deadly blood-borne viral infection (Molnlycke Healthcare, LLC, Norcross, Georgia) Awards Edlich's contributions to teaching and healthcare have been recognized by the following Awards: 1990 Thomas Jefferson Award from the University of Virginia, Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Minnesota Medical Alumni Association (2005), James D. Mills Award from the American College of Emergency Physicians (2008), and the Solomon A. Berson Award in Health Sciences from the New York University School of Medicine (2011).

In some cases the term Plancherel measure is applied specifically in the context of the group G being the finite symmetric group S_n ‚Äì see below. It is named after the Swiss mathematician Michel Plancherel for his work in representation theory. Definition for finite groups Let G be a finite group, we denote the set of its irreducible representations by G^wedge. The corresponding Plancherel measure over the set G^wedge is defined by :mu(pi) = frac{(mathrm{dim},pi)^2}{G}, where piin G^wedge, and mathrm{dim}pi denotes the dimension of the irreducible representation pi. Definition on the symmetric group S_n An important special case is the case of the finite symmetric group S_n, where n is a positive integer. For this group, the set S_n^wedge of irreducible representations is in natural bijection with the set of integer partitions of n. For an irreducible representation associated with an integer partition lambda, its dimension is known to be equal to f^lambda, the number of standard Young tableaux of shape lambda, so in this case Plancherel measure is often thought of as a measure on the set of integer partitions of given order n, given by :mu(lambda) = frac{(f^lambda)^2}{n!}. The fact that those probabilities sum up to 1 follows from the combinatorial identity :sum_{lambda vdash n}(f^lambda)^2 = n!, which corresponds to the bijective nature of the Robinson‚ÄìSchensted correspondence. Application Plancherel measure appears naturally in combinatorial and probabilistic problems, especially in the study of longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation sigma. As a result of its importance in that area, in many current research papers the term Plancherel measure almost exclusively refers to the case of the symmetric group S_n. = Connection to longest increasing subsequence = Let L(sigma) denote the length of a longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation sigma in S_n chosen according to the uniform distribution. Let lambda denote the shape of the corresponding Young tableaux related to sigma by the Robinson‚ÄìSchensted correspondence. Then the following identity holds: :L(sigma) = lambda_1, where lambda_1 denotes the length of the first row of lambda. Furthermore, from the fact that the Robinson‚ÄìSchensted correspondence is bijective it follows that the distribution of lambda is exactly the Plancherel measure on S_n. So, to understand the behavior of L(sigma), it is natural to look at lambda_1 with lambda chosen according to the Plancherel measure in S_n, since these two random variables have the same probability distribution. = Poissonized Plancherel measure = Plancherel measure is defined on S_n for each integer n. In various studies of the asymptotic behavior of L(sigma) as n rightarrow infty, it has proved useful to extend the measure to a measure, called the Poissonized Plancherel measure, on the set mathcal{P}^* of all integer partitions. For any theta > 0, the Poissonized Plancherel measure with parameter theta on the set mathcal{P}^* is defined by :mu_theta(lambda) = e^{-theta}frac{theta^{lambda}(f^lambda)^2}{(lambda!)^2}, for all lambda in mathcal{P}^*. = Plancherel growth process = The Plancherel growth process is a random sequence of Young diagrams lambda^{(1)} = (1),~lambda^{(2)},~lambda^{(3)},~ldots, such that each lambda^{(n)} is a random Young diagram of order n whose probability distribution is the nth Plancherel measure, and each successive lambda^{(n)} is obtained from its predecessor lambda^{(n-1)} by the addition of a single box, according to the transition probability :p( u, lambda) = mathbb{P}(lambda^{(n)}=lambda~~lambda^{(n-1)}= u) = frac{f^{lambda}}{nf^{ u}}, for any given Young diagrams u and lambda of sizes n ‚àí 1 and n, respectively. So, the Plancherel growth process can be viewed as a natural coupling of the different Plancherel measures of all the symmetric groups, or alternatively as a random walk on Young's lattice. It is not difficult to show that the probability distribution of lambda^{(n)} in this walk coincides with the Plancherel measure on S_n. Compact groups The Plancherel measure for compact groups is similar to that for finite groups, except that the measure need not be finite. The unitary dual is a discrete set of finite-dimensional representations, and the Plancherel measure of an irreducible finite-dimensional representation is proportional to its dimension. Abelian groups The unitary dual of a locally compact abelian group is another locally compact abelian group, and the Plancherel measure is proportional to the Haar measure of the dual group. Semisimple Lie groups The Plancherel measure for semisimple Lie groups was found by Harish-Chandra. The support is the set of tempered representations, and in particular not all unitary representations need occur in the support.
