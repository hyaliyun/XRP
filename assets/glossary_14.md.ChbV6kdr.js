Early career Hill attended The Sandon School, Sandon, Chelmsford, Essex and then studied public administration at Birmingham University and followed her father, an Essex County Council officer, into local government. Her first post was as a management trainee at Thurrock Council in the 1980s, followed by director of communications and policy development at North Hertfordshire. In the mid-1990s she was assistant chief executive at Cambridge City Council, and by 2001 she had gained her first chief officer post at Colchester District Council, aged 37, on a salary of £85,000.The Guardian (guardian.co.uk) 19 September 2001 Among her achievements there was a £1.5 billion PFI contract for a new army garrison.bbc.co.uk 10 March 2008 County council CEO In August 2004 Hill became chief executive of Bedfordshire County Council. During her three years tenure, it moved from two to three stars in the Audit Commission's ratings, and was described by them as one of twenty \\"strongly improving\\" authorities in the country. Suffolk county council Hill was appointed chief executive of Suffolk County Council in March 2008 at the age of 44. She was a powerful and vocal advocate of the emerging \\"New Strategic Direction\\" of outsourcing council functions, which became an exemplar for ministers. However, as the cuts of 2010/11 began to loom ever closer, so the media interest in Hill increased, with headlines about her rather than the council.Crackdown on council fat cats By April 2011 Andrea Hill wrote her side of the controversy in the council's house magazine: Inside SCC.\\"So let me tell you the truth about the recent stories: those 'vanity' photographs; my training; the trips to America with BT. I didn't spend £1,500 of taxpayers money on photographs of myself. The Council did pay a photographer for several photographic assignments, but the portraits cost £900 and were for 17 different people. So the per capita cost was £53. And they weren't shot in a studio as some of the papers have claimed, but in the corridors of Endeavour House. And they were taken on 25 June 2009 at a time when we weren't having to cut services. The Council has a licence to publish them so we don't have to pay the photographer to use them. So what's the story about my training? The Council has spent £12,075 + VAT on coaching for me over the past 3 years. This training has been agreed with councillors are part of my annual appraisal and I have found it incredibly helpful in helping me do a tough job in a complex environment. Sol, my coach, isn't a 'lifestyle guru' as the papers claim. Despite what the Daily Telegraph reports, I didn't \\"convince voters to pay £400,000 for her psychology sessions\\". The fact behind the story is that the Council spent £400,000 on leadership training for over 400 staff over 2 years before any spending cuts were being considered. And many of those 400 people have thanked me, on behalf of the Council, because the training was the best they had ever received. Ask them if they thought it was 'psychobabble' as the newspapers like to print - and I can assure you Paul McKenna was nowhere in sight. So what about the two trips to America with BT have they compromised my judgement? In 2008 I did go to both Boston and San Francisco as part of a training programme sponsored by BT. So did 30 other public sector Chief Executives. So too did my predecessor a few years before me and so too have 4 other council Chief Executives or Chief Constables from Suffolk. Not a penny of my trip was funded by taxpayers - not the course, or flights, or hotels, or mileage, or meals or even a cup of coffee. And yes my husband and one of my sons came to join me one weekend  at my personal expense, not charged to BT, not charged to the taxpayer. Has it clouded my judgement in relation to BT? No it hasn't: I have just negotiated £4m of efficiencies and cost reductions in our contract charge this year. And what about how I got the job? Some of the reporting seems to imply something underhand happened. I have no idea why. I applied for the job in open competition - anyone in the country with the right qualifications and experience could have applied. I was interviewed and tested as were other candidates. I won the job fairly.\\" But by then the council's new direction had become increasingly distrusted by elected members, who threw it out with the election of Mark Bee as the replacement council leader for Jeremy Pembroke. That may have sealed Andrea Hill's fate. In July 2011 (aged 47) she received a year's salary as pay-off for relinquishing her post, following a \\"whistle-blowing\\" enquiry that exonerated her of any wrongdoing.The Guardian (guardian.co.uk) 5 May 2011 ; The daily Telegraph (telegraph.co.uk) 4 July 2011 In October 2011 she was replaced by Deborah Cadman OBE.East Anglian Daily Times 20 Oct 2001 Subsequently Ms Hill subsequently took a sabbatical role as a yachting holiday flotilla hostess in the Virgin Islands.

It lies immediately below the summit of the Zugspitze at a height of 2,650 m and was opened on 20 June 1931. It used to house the top station of the Bavarian Zugspitze Railway as well as a tourist hotel. There was then a cable car from the Schneefernerhaus to the Zugspitze summit. In 1938 a gallery for pedestrians was opened from the ridge station of the Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car to the Schneefernerhaus. From 1945 to 1952 the hotel was commandeered for use as a \\"recreation facility\\" by the US Forces. On 15 May 1965 an avalanche, that swept over the sun terrace of the hotel and the lifts on the Zugspitzplatt, claimed 10 lives and injured 21. This tragedy was the impetus behind the introduction of a state avalanche warning service and local avalanche commissions. In 1988, after the new station of the Zugspitze Railway was opened on the plateau and, in 1989, the SonnAlpin restaurant there was extended, the hotel and restaurant operation at the Schneefernerhaus finally closed on 14 January 1992. The trackage of the Zugspitze Railway is still there but is now only used to serve the research station.  Construction  After the tunnel had been driven for the rack railway and the line itself had been finished (laying of the tracks and installation of catenary) on 20 June 1930 it was possible from then on to transport larger quantities of building material and heavy items up the mountain. Once huts for the construction workers had been erected, blasting operations on the plateau could begin. After these and other preparations had finished it was important to begin passenger services as quickly as possible. As a result, there was only a short period of time from the first delivery of construction material to the opening of the line, during which the first construction stage for a wooden building with lighting, heating, water supplies and drainage had to be completed. With that the first guests could be received and fed (initially without any overnight stays). The new building was open to the public on 8 July 1930, just 39 days after the rack railway had opened. Once the wooden building was up and running, work could begin on the actual Schneefernerhaus. Again only partially, because on the site blasted out of the rock, part had to be used for the stacking of building material, machinery, etc. On the side of the mountain, which sloped at about 45 degrees and, in places, was even steeper, no more work space could be made available apart from that created by the blasting operation. In Christmas 1930 the second stage of the present-day Schneefernerhaus was completed. The intention was that the third stage of construction, i.e. the rest of the hotel building, would be carried out to the extent that the wooden hut could remain and continue to provide basic tourist accommodation. In its place, in the fourth stage, the last part of the planned hotel was to have been built. But events turned out differently: the hotel was not extended and the wooden building was demolished after the devastating avalanche in 1965.  Research  The Free State of Bavaria has rented the Schneefernerhaus long term from the Bavarian Zugspitze Railway and converted it into an environmental research station that was opened in 1996. The original left wing of the hotel no longer exists. The station houses scientists from the following institutions: * German Met Office DWD * Umweltbundesamt * German Aerospace Center DLR * Karlsruhe Institute of Technology * Helmholtz Zentrum München * Technical University of Munich * Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich * Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE * Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization The physical and chemical properties of the atmosphere, global climate, medical influences and many other areas are researched at the Schneefernerhaus.

When you first meet a Cofi, you’re usually greeted with this deadpan sort of look, you can never tell what’s going through their minds. That’s probably down to shyness or a desire to be left alone.

Franklin, Rosen, and Weissman was an early 21st century court case from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The government prosecuted one Department of Defense employee (Franklin) and two lobbyists (Rosen & Weissman) for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) for allegedly disclosing national defense information to persons 'not entitled' to have it, a crime under the Espionage Act of 1917 (). It is one of the few Espionage Act cases of its kind, targeted not at traditional espionage or sedition, but at the common practice of information leaking in Washington DC. The cases against Rosen and Weissman were also unusual because this aspect of the Espionage act had rarely (if ever) been used against non-government individuals. Franklin plead guilty, but all charges against Rosen and Weissman were dropped.  Background  Larry Franklin worked for the Department of Defense at the Pentagon. Steve J. Rosen and Keith Weissman were lobbyists for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a lobbyist group. Rosen had worked at RAND Corporation and began work for AIPAC in 1982. Weissman started AIPAC work in 1993 and was an Iran expert. Franklin met Rosen and Weissman circa 2002 and they began exchanging information. By 2003 the FBI had been investigating Rosen for a long time. The government flipped Franklin some time before 2003; he became convinced by the FBI that Rosen and Weissman were doing bad things. Franklin started wearing wires to get evidence against Weissman and Rosen, including a 2003 meeting where he leaked fake information about a planned killing of Israelis, which Rosen took and gave to Israeli diplomats and the media. In 2004 the government raided AIPAC offices. The government alleged the information the three transferred was related to the national defense and otherwise violated  Indictment timeline  The indictment contains a timeline of events it alleges to have occurred; a description of the conspiracy that it claims happened. From 1999 to 2004, it details occasions and circumstances in which Franklin gave information to Rosen & Weissman, and also in which Rosen & Weissman then gave information to several people. The people are referred to in code, as well as in general terms. These include \\"Foreign Official 1\\", 2, and 3, 'AIPAC employees', 'a foreign national', 'foreign nation A', 'a member of the media' (multiple occasions), 'an employee of a think tank' etc. etc. It also lists occasions where Rosen and Weissman allegedly gave false statements to the FBI about Franklin.  Indictment  First page of the grand jury indictment *Count One - Conspiracy to communicate national defense information to persons not entitled to receive it, , , & *Counts Two, Three, & Four - Communication of national defense information to persons not entitled to receive it, *Count Five - Conspiracy to communicate classified information to agent of foreign government, and Government lawyers: James L Trump, Paul J. McNulty (US Attorney), Kevin V Di Gregory (US Attorney, Criminal Division), Neil Hammerstrom (US Attorney, Terrorism and National Security), Thomas Reilly (US DOJ). Later, Dana Boente. Larry Franklin counsel: Plato Cacheris, John Francis Hundley Rosen counsel: Erica Emily Paulson, Joseph John McCarthy Weissman counsel: John N Nassikas, III, Baruch Weiss  Legal principles  Several legal principles were expounded upon regarding the relevant sections of the Espionage Act. Judge T. S. Ellis III had several notable opinions: *Espionage cases against government employees are different from those against non- government individuals. Non-government individual's First Amendment rights can outweigh other concerns *Espionage prosecutions can only be made in \\"situations in which the national security is genuinely at risk\\". *The disclosure of intangible information is different from disclosing documents Intangible cases require \\"bad faith, i.e. with reason to believe the disclosure could harm the United States or aid a foreign government.\\" (i.e. intent is important) *There are limits to the government's attempts to conceal classified information at trial. *\\"Noble motives don't erase the violation\\" - the belief that an official is exposing government wrongdoing is not justification - it does not make them innocent under Espionage Law. It is rather a violation of the principle that officials should follow the rule of law. *The information disclosed has to be National Defense Information; being classified is not enough, in and of itself, for a violation. The judiciary (the jury) is to decide what is NDI and what is not. Other notable features: *The 'silent witness rule' was used, to present evidence to the judge, jury, prosecutor, and defendant, while hiding it from the public. This was referred to by Ellis as a 'partial closing' of the trial. He developed a 'four part fairness test' for use of the rule during this case.See Ellis' decisions *It was one of the first (if not the first) Espionage Act cases that involved non- government officials getting information from a government official.  Result  *Larry Franklin pleaded guilty in 2005 and received a 12 year sentence, later reduced to 100 hours community service and 10 months in a halfway house. This left only Counts I and III against Rosen and Weissman. *All charges against Rosen and Weissman were dropped in 2009. The government claims the judge had made it unlikely they would win and also that they did not want to reveal classified information at trial.

He later settled in the Washington Territory and was one of the founders of Whitman County where he served as a County Commissioner. He had large holdings of fruit orchards and wheat ranches. Congressman William La Follette was his son-in-law. Pioneer John Tabor crossed the plains to California along with thousands of others during the gold rush of 1849. He soon gave up panning for gold as a livelihood and instead shot game which he sold to the miners. He headed north where he married a young widow, Mary Taylor Hamilton, and they settled on a farm in the Willamette Valley in the Oregon Territory. He fought with General Cornelias in the Indian Wars, whose skirmishes took him all over the Inland Empire. When the land which had been off limits to settlers after the Whitman massacre opened up, John Tabor moved his family to the Palouse in the Washington Territory.  Rancher and Public Servant When he first arrived in the Palouse only a few other settlers were in the area. The town of Colfax was formed, and he was elected one of the first County Commissioners of the newly established Whitman County as a Democrat.https://archive.today/20121118205607/http://www.completebbs.com/simonsen/wcgsoff.html After serving one term, he stepped down and concentrated on his fruit orchards and wheat ranches. He was one of the first to bring apples to the region which were planted on his ranch in Wawaiwai on the Snake River. This ranch, which he later sold to his son-in-law William La Follette, eventually became one of the largest in the region, producing a wide variety of fruit which were shipped to market via steamboats on the Snake River and later by rail with the coming of the railroad.http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file;_id=7968 Family John Tabor's family had been moving steadily westward since the American Revolutionary War. He was descended from one of the last British governors of Georgia . His wife's family, the Taylors, had crossed from Virginia into the Oregon Territory in 1848. His daughter, Mary Tabor, married William La Follette in 1886, shortly after the young homesteader from Indiana had begun his own farming and ranching ventures and more that twenty-five years before he took his seat in the United States Congress. John Tabor lived to see many changes come to the land he had helped pioneer. He died when he was walking near the railroad track in Colfax and was struck by a passing train.

It lives underground in tropical regions and forms a mutualistic association with the mealybug, Xenococcus annandalei. Description This ant has the small eyes, compact body and yellowish-brown colouration typical of many ants that live underground.myrmecos.net It can be separated from other Formicine ants found in Australia by the fact that the antennae have eleven segments, the eyes are multifaceted and clearly defined, and the first and second funicular segments are the same size.Nomenclature and distribution of some Australian and New Guinean ants of the subfamily Formicinae Distribution This ant is found in rainforests in tropical regions of India, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Sarawak, Singapore, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea and parts of the Northern Territory and Queensland in Australia. In Australia it is not usually found above 300 metres and occupies a similar range to the weaver ant, Oecophylla smaragdina. Biology This ant lives in association with the mealybug, Xenococcus annandalei in its underground nest. The mealybug is a subterranean species and sucks sap from the rootlets of certain trees, particularly species of Ficus and the coconut palm. It exudes drops of honeydew which form part of the diet of the ant. Worker ants tend the mealybugs and stimulate the production of honeydew by stroking their abdomens. If the ant colony is disturbed and the ants are forced to disperse, each takes a female mealybug to the new nest site, carrying it in her mandibles. When the soil is warm and damp, the ants and mealybugs remain just below the surface, but during cold, dry weather they descend to greater depths. This mutualistic arrangement seems to occur throughout the range of the ant. X. annandalei has not been found anywhere except in association with A. acutiventris in its nest, and while being transported by the queen who carries a female mealybug on her nuptial flight. The colony she founds is thus provided with the food supply it needs to prosper. No other means of dispersal is known for this mealybug.

Founded in 1826 in the tradition of Mechanics' Institutes, it is New Haven's oldest community library and one of the few membership libraries now remaining in North America. The organization was active during the 19th century as a center for lectures, debates, and classes in New Haven. History The Institute Library was born out of the Apprentices' Literary Association. Founded in August 1826, this association organized as an educational society and declared as it mission the \\"mutual assistance in the attainment of useful knowledge.\\" It promoted this mission through a collection of books amassed by the initial group of eight members and the scheduling of regular meetings of the membership. The Association drew the interest of local educators. Shortly afterwards, classes, alongside readings and debates, were regularly featured. In 1835, the Association permitted women to join. In 1841, the organization renamed itself as The New Haven Young Men's Institute. A center of adult education, literary discussion, and civil discourse throughout much of the 19th century, it stood as the largest circulating library in the city and the site of popular lecture series. Speakers at the Institute included Henry Ward Beecher, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Frederick Douglass, and Anna E. Dickinson. In 1878, the Institute Library, as it came to be called by its membership, relocated to its current location at 847 Chapel Street in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1887, the New Haven Free Public Library was established, transforming the Institute Library's focus and mission. Librarian William A. Borden in the years that followed took the opportunity to experiment with new library technologies and practices with collections housed at the Institute Library. Borden formulated a new classification system for the library's collection. Present day After a long period of decline in membership and activity, the library began a period of reengagement with the New Haven community in 2011 and now hosts and sponsors various programs in the arts and humanities. In February of that year, the library hired its first executive director and embarked on a series of major repairs and renovations to the historical building in which the library is housed. In 2011, the Institute Library received the Arts Award from the Arts Council of Greater New Haven for its revitalization efforts.

World War II The 370th was reactivated in October 1942, along with the rest of the 92nd Infantry Division, ten months after the American entry into World War II. After nearly two years of training, it departed the United States in July 1944 and arrived on the Italian Front, landing at Naples on 1 August, attached to the Task Force 42 of the 1st Armored Division. The 370th entered combat on 24 August 1944 as part of the U.S. Fifth Army. It participated in the crossing of the Arno River, the occupation of Lucca and the penetration of the Gothic Line, in the pursuit of an enemy which was retreating from that area. It was later attached to the 92nd Division in Task Force 45, the Fifth Army unit responsible for the Ligurian coastal sector, the left flank of Allied troops in Italy. On 13 October, the remainder of the 92nd Division concentrated for patrol activities. Elements of the 92nd Division moved to the Serchio sector, 3 November, and advanced in the Serchio River Valley against light resistance, but the attempt to capture Castelnuovo did not succeed. Patrol activities continued until 26 December when the enemy attacked (Winter Line), forcing units of the 92nd Division to withdraw. The attack ended on 28 December. The attacking forces were mainly from the Alpine Division \\"Monte Rosa\\", a division of the Italian Fascist Army (4 battalions) with the support of 3 German battalions. Aside from patrols and reconnaissance, units of the 92nd attacked in the Serchio sector, 5–8 February 1945, against the Italian Bersaglieri Division \\"Italia\\", another unit of the army of the Italian Social Republic, but enemy counterattacks nullified division advances.Motley, 1975. Chapter 5. On 1 April, the 370th RCT and the attached 442nd Infantry (Nisei) attacked in the Ligurian coastal sector and drove rapidly north against light opposition of German 148th Infantry Division supported by Italian coastal units. The 370th took over the Serchio sector and pursued a retreating enemy from 18 April until the collapse of enemy forces, 29 April 1945. Elements of the 92nd Division entered La Spezia and Genoa on 27 April and took over selected towns along the Ligurian coast until the enemy surrendered, 2 May 1945. Between August 1944 and May 1945 the 92nd Division suffered 3,200 casualties, factoring losses from units attached to the Division brings the totals up to 5,000 casualties.Ibidem, Motley 1975. On the Italian Front, the Buffalo soldiers had an opportunity to make contact with men of many nationalities: beyond other segregated Americans like the Japanese descendants, they had contact with the also segregated troops of British and French colonial empires (Black Africans, Moroccans, Algerians, Indians, Gurkhas, Jews and Palestinians) as well as with exiled Poles, Greeks and Czechs; anti-fascist Italians and the non-segregated troops of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force.Motley, 1975.

Variations Some variations on the standard giant include: * Forward or front giant - Performed with palms turned inward to face the body and heels leading the down swing instead of the front of the foot. * Inverted, Eagle-Grip, or L-Grip giant - Performed like a forward giant but with the palms turned outward (L-Grip) to face the body * Mixed grip giant - Performed as either a regular or forward giant with the hands held in two different grips (e.g. one hand in L-Grip, one hand in normal grip) * One arm giant - Performed with only one arm holding the bar instead of two * German giant - Performed with palms facing away from the gymnast's body and shoulders rotated backwards * 3/4 giant - Performed starting in front support and casting to parallel then back down and around the bar to the front support position once again * Skoumal giant -Performed as a back giant with the shoulders rotated forward as if doing an \\"inlocate\\" on rings. Essentially like a Manna over the top of the bar.

The 2nd Congress is best remembered for formulating and implementing the 21 Conditions for membership in the Communist International. Delegates II Congress of the Comintern: Lev Karakhan (second from left), Karl Radek (third, smoking), Nikolai Bukharin (fifth), Mikhail Lashevich (seventh, form), Maxim Gorky (ninth, shaved), Vladimir Lenin (tenth, hands in pockets), Sergey Zorin (eleventh in the Hat), Grigory Zinoviev (thirteenth, hands behind his back), Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova (nineteen white blouse), Nicola Bombacci (with beard) and Abram Belenky (in a hat). Overview The 2nd World Congress of the Communist International, held in the summer of 1920, has been regarded by scholars as \\"the first authentic international meeting of the new organization's members and supporters,\\" owing to the ad hoc nature of the 1919 Founding Convention.Branko Lazitch and Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Lenin and the Comintern: Volume 1. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1972; pg. 271. The gathering is also significant for the level of participation of Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin, who participated in the affairs of the gathering more intensely than at any other, preparing a host of key documents and actively helping to chart the gathering's course. The 2nd World Congress took place at a time of heated world political passion, as British historian E.H. Carr later recalled: > \\"The second congress marked the crowning moment in the history of the > Comintern as an international force, the moment when the Russian revolution > seemed most certainly on the point of transforming itself into a European > revolution, with the destinies of the RSFSR merged in those of some broader > European unit.\\"E.H. Carr, A History of Soviet Russia: The Bolshevik > Revolution, 1917-1923: Volume 3. London: Macmillan, 1953; pg. 196. Whereas in 1919 no mass Socialist party had participated in the activities of the Founding Convention, the 1920 gathering saw the inclusion of credentialed delegates from several large European groups, including the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), and the Social Democratic Party of Czechoslovakia.Lazitch and Drachkovitch, Lenin and the Comintern, pg. 272. The Bolsheviks denied permission to attend to the recently formed (January 1920) Ukrainian Communist Party (CPU). It was at the 2nd World Congress that the nature of Communist parties was decided upon, the conditions for their admission to the Communist International set, and the relationship of the national organizations to their international directing center formally established for the first time. Delegate composition The first English edition of Lenin's \\"Left Wing\\" Communism, as distributed to delegates to the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern. The official records of the 2nd World Congress indicate that a total of 218 delegates participated in the proceedings, including 54 representatives of Socialist, Social Democratic, and other non-Communist political parties and 12 representatives of youth organizations.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pg. 8 At least 30 delegates were representatives of the various nationalities of Asia.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pg. 9. Delegates were housed in Moscow at the Delevoi Dvor, a hotel a short walk from the Congress's sessions held at the Kremlin.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pg. 11. With food in short supply, fare provided to the delegates was poor, with some delegates forced to rely to some extent upon stores brought into the country with them. Upon arriving at their hotel rooms, delegates were provided with an assortment of written reports, draft resolutions, and copies of two recently published books — Terrorism and Communism by Leon Trotsky and \\"\\"Left-Wing\\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder by V.I. Lenin.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pg. 12. Delegates participated a wide range of events, touring the country, attending shop meetings, watching theatrical performances, and participating in a subbotnik loading railroad ties. Background On April 22, 1920, the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) voted to hold a 2nd World Congress of its member parties at some indefinite date in the near future.John Riddell (editor and translator), Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!: Proceedings and Documents of the Second Congress, 1920. In two volumes. New York: Pathfinder Press, 1991; vol. 1, pg. 6. This was followed on June 14, 1920, by the formal publication by ECCI of a call for a 2nd World Congress to be held in Moscow one month hence.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pp. 5-6. Political parties pledging allegiance to the organization were urged to send delegations at once. During this period Soviet Russia was subject to an armed blockade by land and sea, making travel extremely difficult. Legal passage was possible only through the Estonian port of Revel (known today as Tallinn), but even this means was difficult due to the systematic denial of travel passports to radicals intending on traveling to Central Europe. War between Soviet Russia and Poland raged in the summer of 1920 and wrecked locomotives and derailed freight cars lined the tracks, further complicating the transportation situation.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pg. 10. Some delegates were forced by circumstances to use false passports and identity documents or to travel without any legal documentation whatsoever, such as by stowing away on a ship.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pg. 7. Three French delegates lost their lives in transit, when a small fishing boat setting sail from Murmansk in an attempt to run the Allied blockade went down in stormy weather.  Proceedings  =Opening of the Congress= The Congress was scheduled to open on July 15, but owing to rampant transit difficulties, many delegates had not arrived in Soviet Russia by that date. ECCI decided to postpone the first working sessions by one week.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pg. 14. Uritsky Theater; 1924 painting by Isaak Brodsky Following a meal in the Great Hall of Smolny, the delegates, accompanied by thousands of Petrograd workers, marched to the Uritsky Theater where they heard a keynote address on the international situation and the tasks of the Comintern delivered by Lenin. Afterwards the delegates participated in a mass demonstration before gathering at the former stock exchange to see a costume drama called \\"Spectacle of the Two Worlds\\" performed by a cast of 3,000. Following the opening festivities in Petrograd, a three-day break followed, after which the Congress reconvened in Moscow in the former Vladimir Throne Room of the Kremlin.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pg. 15. Four official languages were used at the convention — English, French, German, and Russian — with secretaries typing convention documents in each. The primary languages spoken on the floor were French and German, with simultaneous translations taking place in various corners of the room. The Congress elected a Bureau (governing committee) to make decisions about procedure. All delegates had the right to submit resolution proposals to the Congress and the privilege was not an empty one, as a number of such proposals were submitted.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pg. 16. Voting delegates were provided with red cards, non-voting \\"consultative\\" delegates blue cards, and guests green cards, with votes taken by means of counting cards. Voting strength of each delegation was based upon the relative importance of each national party to the international communist movement rather than the actual size of the membership of these groups. At no point in the Congress was a roll call vote taken; rather, a simple counting of cards raised on the floor determined all outcomes. =Notable Topics and Decisions Discussed= The 21 Conditions Comintern Chairman Grigorii Zinoviev. The 2nd World Congress began its actual work on July 23, 1920.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pg. 42. Two sessions were dedicated to discussion of the structure and role of Communist parties, with a summary report and theses delivered to the body by Comintern Chairman Grigorii Zinoviev. After Zinoviev's theses on the matter were unanimously adopted by the assembled delegates, debate moved to conditions for admission to the Communist International, a discussion which ultimately produced a document known as the 21 Conditions. Ever since the founding of the Comintern in 1919, a number of political parties in the Social Democratic tradition — including the Socialist Party of America (SPA) and the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) — had sought admission into the ranks of the international organization. To the Comintern leadership, the electoral orientation and pacifism of such organizations marked them as fundamentally different from the Communist movement and its orientation towards armed struggle and saw the Comintern as a mechanism for the centralized coordination of such efforts around the world. Such so-called \\"Centrist\\" parties, with the German USPD in the first rank, sought a more inclusive and advisory role for the Comintern, in line with the model utilized by the ill-fated Second International. The four delegates of the USPD remained united before the session of the 2nd Congress's Commission on Conditions for Admission.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pg. 43. On July 25, the Commission on Conditions for Admission voted 5-3 on a proposal by Lenin that only parties with a clear majority on their governing Central Committee favoring affiliation to the Comintern prior to the 2nd World Congress would be permitted membership in that organization. Subsequent debate by the Congress itself on July 29 and 30 urged against any concessions to so-called \\"Centrist\\" leaders. Following extended commission discussions, a set of 21 Conditions for admission to the Comintern was proposed.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pg. 44. The trade union question The 2nd World Congress dealt extensively with the relationship between the trade union movement and the emerging international communist movement. Left-wing communists were scornful of the \\"conservative\\" nature of the established union movement in many counties, exemplified by the American Federation of Labor in the United States and the reformist International Federation of Trade Unions, based in Amsterdam.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pg. 46. The limited horizons of such organizations, limited to matters of daily concern as wages, hours, and working conditions, were seen as a manifestation of class collaboration and an impediment to the revolutionary transformation of society. The left-wing communists argued that these unions were a by-product of capitalism and that they, like the political parties of the Second International, had betrayed the working class by supporting their national governments in World War I — seen as a war of imperial conquest.Carr, A History of Soviet Russia, vol. 3, pg. 201. Such unions were worthy only of expeditious destruction, the left-wing communists believed. Lenin and other Comintern leaders disagreed sharply with the demand of the left-wing communists that new explicitly revolutionary dual unions should be established and supported, arguing the 25 million workers participating in unions affiliated with the Amsterdam International had already made their basic organizational decision. Instead, Lenin and his co-thinkers argued, radical workers should remain within these established unions and to attempt to work from within to move them onto a revolutionary course. At the same time the Comintern leadership had already been working to establish a new revolutionary international union organization to compete with the Amsterdam International — a goal which the left-wing communists saw as contradictory with the policy of remaining within the established \\"conservative\\" unions.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pp. 46-47. Meetings between Comintern officials and trade union leaders in Moscow in the summer of 1920 had led to the establishment of the International Council of Trade and Industrial Unions (Mezhsovprof), forerunner of the Red International of Labor Unions (Profintern) that was established the next year.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pp. 48-49. The union question remained a matter of heated contention at the 2nd World Congress, with the representatives of the British shop stewards' movement and syndicalist delegates from Germany and the United States refusing to abandon their hostility to the strategy of \\"boring from within\\" the established unions.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pg. 48. Ultimately, the majority of the 2nd World Congress moved to support Lenin's policy, detailed at length in his recently published book \\"Left-Wing\\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder.The title of the Russian original of Lenin's polemic against the left-wing communists, Детская болезнь \\"левизны\\" в коммунизме, actually translates as \\"The Childhood Illness of 'Leftism' in Communism.\\" The colonial question The 2nd World Congress also for the first time paid serious attention to the national liberation movements of the colonies of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pg. 51. Theses on colonial issues were presented to the Congress by Indian radical M.N. Roy, formally a delegate from the fledgling Communist Party of Mexico, Avetis Sultan-Zade of Persia, and Pak Chin-sun of Korea. The final resolution of the Congress directed communists in colonial countries to support the \\"national-revolutionary\\" movement in each, without regard to the fact that non-communist and non-working class elements such as the bourgeoisie and the peasantry might be dominant.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pg. 52. Particular attention was paid to formulating an alliance with the rural poor as a means of winning and holding power in a revolution.Riddell, Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! vol. 1, pg. 55. Russia's Bolsheviks did not apply any of this to non-Russian territories under Bolshevik control at the time -- although non-Russian communist parties in those territories did. Cultural and sports activities There were several cultural and sports activities arranged to accompany the second congress: *a soccer match between Moscow and an International XI. Willie Gallagher captained the International XI which included John Reed. However they lost heavily to Moscow in front of a crowd of 18,000 in the Red Stadium, located in the former Moscow River Yacht Club. Legacy Boris Kustodiyev. Festival of the II Congress of Comintern on the Uritsky Square (former Palace square) in Petrograd Historian E.H. Carr has argued that the 2nd World Congress — to some extent unintentionally and unconsciously — was the first to \\"establish Russian leadership of Comintern on an impregnable basis.\\"Carr, A History of Soviet Russia, vol. 3, pg. 197. In addition to the esteem accorded the Russians as practitioners of the first successful Marxist revolution, Carr noted that the Russian delegation \\"invariably spoke with a united voice,\\" in sharp contrast to the contentious and divided delegations from Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, and the United States.Carr, A History of Soviet Russia, vol. 3, pg. 198. Therefore, \\"the Communist International which would make the world revolution was created in the image of the party which had made the Russian revolution,\\" Carr observed.Carr, A History of Soviet Russia, vol. 3, pp. 198-199.

Serving as the headquarters of the City Investing Company, it was on Cortlandt Street between Church Street and Broadway in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan. The building was designed by Francis Kimball and constructed by the Hedden Construction Company. Because of the area's sloping topography, the City Investing Building rose 32 stories above Broadway and 33 stories above Church Street, excluding an attic. The bulk of the building was 26 stories high above Church Street and was capped by a seven-story central portion with gable roofs. The building had an asymmetrical F-shaped footprint with a light court facing Cortlandt Street, as well as a wing to Broadway that wrapped around a real estate holdout, the Gilsey Building. Inside was a massive lobby stretching between Broadway and Church Street. The upper stories each contained between of space on each floor. Work on the City Investing Building started in 1906, and it opened in 1908 with about of floor area, becoming one of New York City's largest office buildings at the time. Though developed by the City Investing Company, the structure had multiple owners throughout its existence. The City Investing Building was sold to Grigori Benenson in 1919 and renamed the Benenson Building. After Benenson was unable to pay mortgage for the Benenson Building, it was sold twice in the 1930s. The building was renamed 165 Broadway by 1938 and was renovated in 1941. The City Investing Building and the adjacent Singer Building were razed in 1968 to make room for One Liberty Plaza, which had more than twice the floor area than the two former buildings combined.  Site  The City Investing Building was in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, with frontage on Church Street to the west, Cortlandt Street to the north, and Broadway to the east. The City Investing Building had a frontage of on Cortlandt Street, on Church Street and Trinity Place, and on Broadway. It had a depth of , abutting the Singer Building to the south. The site slopes down from Broadway to Church Street, so that there was a raised basement facing Church Street, which was below ground at Broadway. The City Investing Building's northeastern section wrapped around a real estate holdout, the Gilsey Building (also the Wessels Building or Benedict Building), at the southwestern corner of Cortlandt Street and Broadway. The Gilsey Building had a frontage of on Broadway and on Cortlandt Street. The City Investing Building's original owner, the City Investing Company, held a long-term lease for the Gilsey Building, which would have eventually been demolished to make way for an addition to the City Investing Building. To the south, there was a gap of between the City Investing Building and the Singer Tower addition to the Singer Building, which was built nearly simultaneously with the City Investing Building. The narrowness of the setback was a result of a design choice by the Singer's architect, Ernest Flagg. The columns required to support the Singer Tower would have been too large to place atop the original Singer Building, at the south end of the same block near Liberty Street.  Design  View from the north with the Hudson Terminal (right), the Singer Building (middle back, the tallest structure) and the City Investing Building (middle front, slanted roof on tallest extension) The City Investing Building was designed by Francis H. Kimball. The general contract was awarded to the Hedden Construction Company and the contract for the foundation work was given to the O'Rourke Engineering and Contracting Company. In addition, Weiskopf and Stern were consultants for the steel frame, Griggs and Holbrook were consultants for steam and electricity, and William C. Tucker was consulting sanitary engineer. The steel was made by the American Bridge Company and erected by Post and McCord. The stonework came from William Bradley & Sons; the ornamental ironwork from Hecla Iron Works; the terracotta and other tilework from the National Fireproofing Company; the plumbing from Wells and Newton; and the marble work from J. H. Shipway and Bros. The City Investing Building's facade was divided into three horizontal sections: a base with four stories and a raised basement; a shaft with 21 stories and a full-height cornice; and a capital with six stories and an attic. There was also a cellar below the raised basement. The City Investing Building rose above Broadway. Sources differ on how many stories the building had. An official building brochure and the Engineering Record described the building as having 32 stories, as counted from Broadway, although this excluded the attic. The Real Estate Record and Guide described the building as rising 33 stories, as counted from Church Street, but excluding the attic. Yet another source gave the height as with 34 stories, including the attic. = Form = The City Investing Building was largely shaped in an \\"F\\", with the two northward \\"prongs\\" of the \\"F\\" flanking a light court on Cortlandt Street. The light court rose above the second story on the Cortlandt Street elevation. A wing ran eastward to Broadway, between the Gilsey and Singer buildings. The bulk of the building, comprising the base and shaft, consisted of 25 occupiable stories above Broadway, plus a 26th story in the cornice. The \\"prongs\\" on Cortlandt Street were designed as narrow towers terminating at the 26th story. Above the Broadway wing, the 26th story was topped by a series of engaged columns with a belvedere at the center. A flat roof rose above much of the 26th story. The central section of the building, recessed from the light court on Cortlandt Street, rose six additional stories into the capital, with an ornate gable roof made of copper. A smaller gable rose to the 31st floor directly to the east. = Facade = Facade detail, 1967 The five-story base was clad with light stone, while the shaft and capital were decorated with white brick and terracotta. Porcelain and enamel brick were used to reduce cleaning costs, since that type of brick did not discolor over time. The main entrance was at Broadway and contained a semicircular-headed opening. The fourth floor was topped by a large cornice that was at the same level as the roof of the six-story Gilsey Building. Robert E. Dowling, the building's developer, hired Vincenzo Alfano to design sculptural groups for the facade. The 5th through 25th floors contained window bays, which generally contained two or three windows on each story. The corner bays on the \\"prongs\\" facing Cortlandt Street contained one window per floor. At various points on the facade, some of the center bays on each side contained groupings of several stories, each of which contained engaged columns and balconies. There were also horizontal belt courses between several stories. The 26th floor was inside the cornice. = Structural features = The City Investing Building used a steel frame with concrete-slab floors, terracotta floor arches and partitions, and interior marble work. When completed, the building was said to weigh , excluding live loads. The steel frame alone weighed . As completed, the building used 9.1 million bricks, 25,000 lighting fixtures, of terracotta, about of plaster, about of hollow tile, of marble, and about 21.8 million mosaic cubes. Also included in the building was many miles of plumbing, steam piping, wood base, picture molding, conduits, and electrical wiring. The building contained woodwork made of fireproofed mahogany.  Superstructure  The superstructure consisted of a steel cage wherein the columns at every story supported the walls. The columns, in turn, sat on cast-steel pedestals, which transmitted their loads through girders and grillages. There were 89 columns on each floor, arranged in six rows. The largest column carried a load of and had a cross section of . The floors consisted of hollow-tile flat arches or concrete with cinder filling, and were surfaced with mosaic or terrazzo tiles. The distributing girders on the third story of the Broadway wing were the largest and heaviest to be used in the building; they comprised a triple girder weighing about and spanning the entire width of that wing. Portal braces and curved knee braces were included to provide wind resistance, but also contributed to the building's weight. The exterior walls were curtain walls whose thicknesses had been prescribed by city building codes of the time. The south wall was generally thick at the base, tapering to just below the 25th floor. The other walls varied in thickness from 32 inches at the base to below the 25th floor. There were also two walls carried atop the third- floor girders, which extended to the 27th and 32nd floors.  Foundation  The foundation was excavated using rectangular caissons of varying width. The pits were drilled through layers of earth, quicksand, clay, gravel, and water to a solid rock layer beneath Broadway. The main excavation was carried to below Broadway, except at the site of the boiler room, where the excavations were carried deep. Each caisson was and made of yellow pine. A steel shaft rose from each of the caissons. The underlying ground was drawn out from the caissons, and then the caissons were filled with concrete. The retaining walls of the foundation were then constructed of concrete slabs between I-beams spaced apart. The excavation involved removing of masonry and of earth, while the foundation piers used of concrete. Sections of the masonry basement floors from the previous buildings on the site were also removed in the process. Within the foundation were placed 59 concrete piers, which carried the columns of the aboveground superstructure. The cross-sections of the piers varied, with the smallest measuring , and the largest measuring . The caissons supported foundation piers that were topped by plates with grillages of transversely laid I-beams. Most of the superstructure's exterior columns were supported on cantilevers; deep plate girders were placed over the grillages, and the cantilevers extended outward from these girders, where they supported the columns. The foundation also used distributing girders, some of which were triple girders weighing . The cellar floor was poured as a single layer of concrete, thick. This helped distribute the building loads and counteracted the upward hydrostatic pressure. = Interior =  Interior spaces  Depiction of the lobby The City Investing Building was one of New York City's largest office buildings at the time of its completion, with an estimated of floor area. Generally, there was more space on higher stories than on lower stories, largely because the building's elevators were staggered into three banks serving different sets of floors. The 5th through 9th floors typically had per floor; the 10th through 17th floors each had ; and the 18th through 25th floors each had . However, the 27th through 31st floors, located in the smaller \\"capital\\" of the building, typically had . On the top of the building was a luncheon club. The entrance arch on Broadway led to a limestone vestibule about deep, which contained the main doors. Inside the vestibule was a double-height lobby running westward to the elevated Cortlandt Street station of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company's Sixth Avenue Line at Church Street. It measured tall and wide. The arched ceiling of the lobby was decorated with colorful frescoes. The lobby was clad throughout with several types of Italian marbles. Three elevator banks extended from the southern wall of the lobby. The second floor contained offices north of the lobby, and a footbridge was placed across the lobby to connect the elevators and offices. The upper floors typically had a west-east elevator hallway along the southern wall, with the other areas being used for rental space. Generally, the ceiling heights of the lower stories were higher than on the upper stories. The first story had a ceiling of , the second story and the third story . Most of the subsequent stories had ceiling heights of between , although the 26th floor had a ceiling of . The basement, at ground level at Church Street, had a ceiling of and the cellar had a ceiling of .  Utilities and elevators  A cellar extended under the Broadway sidewalk, and contained the building's boiler room. The boiler plant was capable of an output of . The building also had a water system that could filter per day and its plumbing system could pump out five times as much. There were two water tanks: one had a capacity of and was used for fire protection, while the other had a capacity of and served the clients. Also in the building was an electric light plant. The building contained 24 elevators in total. From the lobby, there were 21 plunger elevators for passengers and 2 electric elevators for freight. The plunger elevators were made by the Standard Plunger Company and the electric elevators were made by Otis Elevator. The elevators were placed in three banks the south side of the building, along the section facing the Singer Tower. Seven elevators served all the floors from the lobby to the 9th story; another seven ran express from the lobby to the 9th story, then served all floors through the 17th; and the final seven ran express from the lobby to the 17th story, then served all floors to the 26th. A separate elevator served the 25th through 32nd stories. Two staircases ran between the basement and 25th floor, with another staircase running to the 32nd floor. History The City Investing Building was developed by Robert E. Dowling, who in the first decade of the 20th century was also developing the Trinity and United States Realty Buildings nearby. Dowling was the president of the City Investing Company, a conglomerate that had split from the United States Realty and Construction Company in late 1904. By early 1906, he had hired Kimball, who at the time was well known for constructing other bulky skyscrapers whose construction required pneumatic caissons. Dowling intended the building to include large floors for the growing number of tenants who sought large amounts of office space on a single floor. Dowling also wanted a building with a grand lobby and 21 tenant elevators. = Construction = View of the City Investing Building (right) and Singer Building (left) from the north. At far left is the St. Paul Building. The City Investing Company bought the Coal and Iron Exchange Building at Church and Cortlandt Streets in January 1906. It bought further land on Cortlandt Street the same April. The general construction contract was given to the Hedden Construction Company in September 1906. The next month, there circulated rumors that the City Investing Building would rise to 39 stories—one less than the Singer Tower to the south, which was simultaneously being erected as the world's tallest building—but this modification did not happen. Demolition of buildings on the City Investing Building's site proceeded through 1906. The Coal and Iron Exchange Building took five months to destroy, because of the extremely thick materials it used; it was demolished by October 1906, although its cornerstone was not retrieved until June 1907. Excavation of the foundations began in November 1906, with an average of 275 workers during the day shift and 100 workers during the night shift. The excavation was required to be completed in 120 days. To remove the spoils from the foundation, three temporary wooden platforms were constructed to street level. Hoisting engines were installed to place the beams for the foundation, while the piers were sunk into the ground under their own weight. Because of the lack of space in the area, the contractors' offices were housed beneath the temporary platforms. During the process of excavation, the Gilsey Building's foundations were underpinned or shored up, because that building had relatively shallow foundations descending only below Broadway. After the foundations were completed, a light wooden falsework was erected on the Broadway wing to support the traveler, which contained two derricks to erect the massive girders in that section. The traveler was moved deeper into the lot as the girders were erected. The girders were erected quickly at night, with 16 girders and 20 columns being erected in a week. A worker was killed during construction when a temporary floor collapsed in June 1907. The building was completed in a then-record 22 months, having employed 3,000 workers. = Use = Tenants started moving into the building in April 1908. Early tenants of the City Investing Building included the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, Midvale Steel, the American Car and Foundry Company, the Southern Pacific Transportation Company, the Westinghouse Air Brake Company, New York Air Brake, and the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company. In December 1919, London banker Grigori Benenson bought the City Investing Building for $10 million in cash. At the time, the building was estimated to be worth $7 million, but contained a $5.75 million mortgage held by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. The City Investing Building was accordingly renamed the Benenson Building. Benenson acquired the title to the building in July 1920. He received a $9.5 million mortgage loan for the building in 1926. During the 1920s, the Benenson Building gained tenants such as the Chemical Bank and advertising agency Albert Frank & Company. Benenson also brought adjacent property to the north, intending to construct a supertall skyscraper on the site, but these plans were canceled due to the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Benenson's company suffered financially from the Wall Street Crash and defaulted on its mortgages in the years afterward. The Benenson Building and the company's other structures, including the adjacent 99 Liberty Street, were placed for sale in October 1931 as part of foreclosure proceedings against the company. The building at the time was assessed as being worth $10.4 million. Charles F. Noyes acquired the Benenson Building and several of Benenson's other properties the next month. By 1936, there were plans to renovate the Benenson Building, with the project being funded through rental income. The Benenson Building and another adjacent structure were auctioned again in 1938 to satisfy the liens against the properties. The New York Trust Company acquired the Benenson Building for $5 million, and the building was renamed 165 Broadway. The building was renovated in 1941 for $300,000. The entrances, elevators, and corridors were renovated, and new fluorescent lighting was installed. At the time, the Chemical Bank occupied the first six floors of both 165 Broadway and the Gilsey Building. 165 Broadway, the Gilsey Building, and 99 Liberty Street were sold in 1947 to N. K. Winston and George Gregory for $11 million. = Demolition = In 1964, United States Steel acquired the City Investing Building, along with the neighboring Singer Building. U.S. Steel planned to demolish the entire block to erect a new 54-story headquarters on the same site. Although preservationists attempted to get the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission to protect the Singer Building, the City Investing Building received relatively little notice. Demolition of both buildings was underway by 1968. The U.S. Steel Building (later known as One Liberty Plaza) was built on the site, being completed in 1973. One Liberty Plaza had at least twice the two former buildings' combined interior area. One Liberty Plaza contained per floor, compared with the per floor in the City Investing Building. At the time of its destruction, the City Investing Building was the third-tallest building ever demolished, behind the Morrison Hotel and the Singer Building.  Impact  The City Investing Building, along with other nearby structures such as the Singer Building, Hudson Terminal, and the Equitable Building, was a frequently photographed skyscraper in Lower Manhattan. The completion of the Equitable Building to the southeast in 1915 placed the City Investing Building into permanent shadow up to the 24th floor. The situation led to New York City's 1916 Zoning Resolution, which required buildings to be set back above a certain height. According to architectural journalist Christopher Gray and architectural historians Sarah Landau and Carl Condit, the City Investing Building was regarded as a \\"monument to greed\\" with its sheer size. Photographs of the building almost always showed its northern side on Cortlandt Street because its primary elevation to the east along Broadway was excessively narrow. Architect Donn Barber described the facade as \\"somewhat showy both in design and material\\" and regarded the lobby as \\"the finest piece of commercial designing and execution that we have yet seen downtown.\\" Kimball, the building's architect, characterized the light-toned exterior as contrasting with the \\"darker and more somber\\" appearance of nearby buildings.

He did not seek re-election in 2004; stood again at a by-election in 2005; and became mayor in 2006. Patterson generated significant public profile between 2007 and 2009 as Camden Council rejected an application from the Quranic Society seeking Council's permission to develop land for the construction of a four-day Islamic school within the local government area. The Society took Camden Council to the New South Wales Land and Environment Court, and sought to have Council's ruling overturned. The Court rejected the Society's application, amidst race and religion-based arguments. Patterson, as mayor, was the vocal spokesperson defending Council's actions. Political career In 2007, Patterson successfully sought Liberal Party pre-selection for Camden and ran against Labor's Geoff Corrigan, but was defeated. On 21 October 2010, the Liberal Party announced that Patterson was endorsed as the party's candidate for Camden ahead of the 2011 State election. Patterson was elected with a swing of 21.9 points and won the seat with 68.9 per cent of the two-party vote. His main opponent was Corrigan, representing Labor.

Stratigraphy and paleoenvironment  The Menuha Formation records the earliest occurrence of tectonic activity within the Ramon anticline, forming the present erosive valley known as \\"Makhtesh Ramon\\" as an outcome of a sequence of erosive events evolving since the Late Cretaceous (Avni, 1993). It consists of white and yellow/brown chalk that is often glauconitic and sometimes conglomeratic or marly. The Menuha Formation likely represents a temperate to subtropical, open shelf environment deposited during the formation of the Ramon anticline. Reworked conglomeratic chalks in the western section represent marginal facies derived from this structural uplift. The paleoenvironment is based on the occurrences of several shark and fish teeth, oysters, trace fossils, phosphatic peloids, and foraminiferans.

History The American Board of Medicolegal Death Investigators (ABMDI) was founded in February 1998, following research by the Chief Medical Examiner of Milwaukee, Dr Jeffrey Jantzen, which revealed a lack of regulation in the skills needed for medicolegal death investigations. No particular education was required to practice as a death investigator, and training was provided 'on the job'. The ABMDI was therefore established to test and certify medicolegal death investigators on a national level. Mission The purpose of the American Board of Medicolegal Death Investigators is as follows: * To encourage adherence to high standards of professional practice and ethical conduct when performing medicolegal death investigations. * To recognize qualified individuals who have voluntarily applied for basic and advanced levels of professional certification. * To grant and issue certificates to individuals who have demonstrated their mastery of investigational techniques and who have successfully completed rigorous examination of their knowledge and skills in the field of medicolegal death investigation. * To maintain a listing of individuals granted ABMDI certification. * To recertify individuals every five years according to established professional recertification criteria, including continuing education requirements and work verification. Certification Process The Registry Certification (Basic) is the initial certification that provides official recognition that an individual has acquired basic knowledge and demonstrated proficiency in the standards of practice necessary to properly conduct a competent, thorough medicolegal death investigation. = Eligibility = # Must be at least eighteen years of age at time of application. # Must have a high school diploma or equivalent. # Must currently be employed in a Medical Examiner or Coroner office or equivalent military authority with the job responsibility to \\"conduct death scene investigations\\" at time of application and examination. # Must have a minimum of 640 hours of death investigation experience # Each on-call hour = 0.25 hours # Investigation of a natural death, no scene investigation = 1 hour # Investigation of non-natural death, no scene investigation = 2.5 hours # Investigation of a death with scene investigation = 5 hours Currently, the ABMDI does not endorse any program that claims to fulfill the requirements of certification or prepare an individual for the certification exam. = Examination = The present examination for the ABMDI consists of a 240 multiple choice examination covering the following eight sections: # Interacting with Federal, State and Local Agencies # Communicating # Interacting with Families # Investigating Deaths # Identifying and Preserving Evidence # Maintaining Ethical and Legal Responsibilities # Demonstrating Scientific Knowledge # Coping with Job- Related Stress Current work A main part of ABMDI's work is the certification examination; after this initial certification, continued training and education is required for recertification. As of 2007, there were approximately 800 ABMDI-registered death investigators.

Description The adult female X. annandalei is an elongated oval shape with an abdomen that tapers abruptly at the back. The antennae are nearly as long as the body and have four segments. There is a special means of articulation between the enlarged first and second segments so that the antennae can be folded back along the body. The back is covered in minute setae which take the place of the mealy wax found on most mealybugs. In fact there are no body wax pores. The underside has fewer longer setae. The legs are well developed and terminate in a long slender claw. The anal ring lies at the apex of the abdomen and projects beyond the ventral anal lobes. The ring has eight setae, the anterior two pairs slender and the posterior pair thick and long. There are two circuli which are round, sclerotized and slightly conical.The anomalous ant-attended mealybugs of south-east Asia This is a subterranean species found in the nests of the ant Acropyga acutiventris, living on the rootlets of Ficus species. When the soil is damp and warm both ants and mealybugs are found near the surface under stones but in cold or dry weather they go much deeper into the soil. If the nest is disturbed, the ants carry away mealybugs in their mandibles. Host species This species infests the roots of the coconut palm, Cocus nucifera, the sacred fig, Ficus religiosa, and Ficus obtusa. Distribution This species is found in the Northern Territory of Australia, Queensland, Papua New Guinea, Hong Kong, India (Orissa), Malaysia and Vietnam.Scale Net Biology X. annandalei sucks sap from the roots of the host trees. It is attended and cared for by the ant, Acropyga acutiventris, which lives in colonies underground and has a mutualistic association with the mealybugs which live inside its nest. The excess sugar in the sap is excreted as honeydew which is removed by the ants which may stimulate its production by palpating the mealybug's abdomen. When the young ant queens leave the nest on their nuptial flight, they carry female mealybugs in their jaws ready for the foundation of new colonies.Nomenclature and distribution of some Australian and New Guinean ants of the subfamily Formicinae This mutualistic association is found throughout the range of the ant. Other Acropyga species have similar relationships with other species of mealybugs, and it could be a trait common to the whole genus. Fossil specimens of Acropyga have been recovered from amber deposits in the Dominican Republic and several of these are carrying Electromyrmococcus, an extinct genus of mealybug.Acropyga References Pseudococcidae Hemiptera of Asia Taxa named by Filippo Silvestri ","title":"Xenococcus annandalei"},{"id":"31458801","text":"Pemberton's Parlour is a structure on the northern part of the Chester city walls, and it was formerly known as the Goblin Tower.

He has been a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly representing the seat of Epping for the Liberal Party since 2019, having previously represented Castle Hill from 2011 to 2015 and Hawkesbury from 2015 to 2019. Perrottet has previously served as the Minister for Industrial Relations in the first Berejiklian ministry; the Minister for Finance, Services and Property in the second Baird ministry; the Minister for Finance and Services in the first Baird ministry. Early life and background Perrottet was born in 1982, and raised in West Pennant Hills, Sydney. He is the third eldest of 12 children. His father, John Perrottet, works for the World Bank as the Global Lead for Tourism at the International Finance Corporation, in Washington, DC. Perrottet was educated at Redfield College in Dural and Oakhill College in Castle Hill. Perrottet was active in student politics while studying commerce and law at the University of Sydney and campaigned for voluntary student unionism. He went on to work as a commercial lawyer for Henry Davis York in the areas of banking restructuring and insolvency law. Perrottet was the President of the NSW Young Liberals Movement in 2005 and served on the NSW State Executive of the Liberal Party from 2008 to 2011. Political career Following the resignation of sitting Liberal MP Michael Richardson, Perrottet won Liberal preselection for the very safe Liberal seat of Castle Hill in November 2010, with the backing of right- wing power broker David Clarke. Clarke battled against Alex Hawke, Federal Member for Mitchell, to gain control of preselections. At the 2011 state election, Perrottet was elected with a swing of 12.2 per cent, and won 80.8 per cent of the vote on a two party preferred basis. With the resignation of Barry O'Farrell as Premier, and the subsequent ministerial reshuffle by Mike Baird, the new Liberal Leader, Perrottet was appointed as Minister for Finance and Services in April 2014. Following a redistribution of electoral boundaries, Perrottet traded seats with fellow Liberal Ray Williams for the 2015 state election. Perrottet handed Castle Hill to Williams to run in Williams' equally safe seat of Hawkesbury. Perrottet was elected with 68 per cent of the two-party preferred vote. After the resignation of Baird as Premier, the main factions of the NSW Liberals agreed to support his deputy, Gladys Berejiklian, as his successor, with Perrottet as her deputy. Berejiklian is from the party's moderate wing, while Perrottet is from the conservative wing. Accordingly, on 23 January 2017, Berejiklian and Perrottet were unanimously elected as leader and deputy leader of the NSW Liberal Party.Clennell, Andrew.

When Berejiklian reshuffled her ministry, Perrottet took over her former ministerial roles as Treasurer and Minister for Industrial Relations, with effect from 30 January 2017. In the lead up to the 2019 state election, Perrottet attempted to wrest Castle Hill back from Williams, citing work-life balance as Hawkesbury was too far for him to travel. This was unsuccessful, with Williams retaining the Liberal preselection, and resulted in media reports of significant party infighting and Perrottet publicly apologising. Eventually, Perrottet abandoned the Hawkesbury preselection, and he settled on his second-choice, the equally safe seat of Epping.https://www.9news.com.au/2018/09/25/11/59/dominic-perrottet- liberal-infighting-epping-seat At the 2019 state election Perrottet was elected as Member for Epping and reappointed as Treasurer in the second Berejiklian ministry.

In its classification the Library tries to remain faithful, as much as possible, to the Catalogue de la bibliothèque du Palais de la paix, designed in 1916 by Elsa Oppenheim, daughter of the international lawyer Jacques Oppenheim. The Library also uses a modern classification system with around 4,500 keywords. =International and national law= Most of the publications of the Library are about public international law, addressing topics such as the law of State responsibility, human rights, international humanitarian law, international criminal law, law of international organizations, European law, etc. The collection of the Palace further includes private international law, international commercial law, international bankruptcy law, and international law of procedure. In 2012 the Peace Palace Library and the Institute for Environmental Security began compiling a research database on the proposed Law of Ecocide. The Library also collects books on topics of national law, such as comparative law, domestic public and constitutional law, criminal law and criminal procedure. =Special collections= The library houses a few special collections, of which the Grotius Collection and the Peace Movement collection are the most important. The Library has the world's largest collection of works by Hugo Grotius, including a rare early edition of De Iure Belli ac Pacis (On the Law of War and Peace), his most famous work written in 1625. Publications The library maintains the Peace Palace Library Blog, the news service International Law News, and the Peace Palace Library Research Guides, introducing researchers to various topics of international law.

A cousin of W. G. Grace, he played for Gloucestershire when, dominated by the Grace family, it was the leading county. Gilbert's best season was 1876, when he scored 205 not out for the county, but he was subsequently less successful. Closely connected with the United South of England Eleven, a professional touring team of which he eventually became secretary, Gilbert was financially affected by a declining interest in such teams. With insufficient income to continue as an amateur he became a professional in 1886, but played only one match before he was caught stealing from teammates in a minor match, ending his first-class career. After serving a 28-day prison sentence Gilbert moved to Canada, where he worked for the Land Titles Office in Calgary while remaining a prominent cricketer. He died aged 70 in 1924, but for nearly 60 years after his death, there seemed to be a conspiracy of silence over his fate. Early life and career Walter Gilbert was born in London on 16 September 1853. He spent some time living in Downend with his maternal aunt, Martha Grace, the mother of W. G. Grace, as a result of which he became friendly with Grace and his brothers.Green, p. 92. Between 1869 and 1871 Gilbert made several appearances in minor cricket for teams representing Worcestershire and went on to play for the United South of England Eleven, one of several fully professional teams that toured the country playing mainly minor matches. In 1871 he made his first-class debut, playing as an amateur in a team chosen by for a match against Kent. He scored 13 and 1, kept wicket in at least the first innings, held two catches, and achieved a stumping. By virtue of his London birth, Gilbert was qualified to play cricket for Middlesex. He made nine appearances for the county during the 1873 and 1874 seasons, achieving a highest score of 49, averaging 17.40 with the bat and taking two wickets. His first score of over fifty runs in first- class matches came for the United South of England XI, for whom he continued to play regularly, against the United North of England XI in 1874. He also achieved some success as a bowler, taking five wickets for W. G. Grace's team against Kent in 1873. Achieving prominence In the English winter of 1873–74, Gilbert was chosen by W. G. Grace to accompany his touring team to Australia. Gilbert had a string of single-figure scores and a highest score of 33 not out. Nevertheless, he and Grace got on well, and he was a popular member of the touring party. Grace enjoyed his company to the extent of hunting kangaroos with him. During the 1874 season Gilbert made a double century in minor cricket, scoring 254 not out for Thornbury against Sneyd Park. Later in the season he made a further representative appearance, playing for the Gentlemen against the Players at Prince's Cricket Ground and opening the batting with W. G. Grace; he scored 14 and 16 and took four wickets in the Players' first innings. He also played in the corresponding fixture the following year. By 1876 Gilbert had qualified to play for Gloucestershire, as he had lived in the county for the length of time required by the rules. In his first season for the club he finished fifth in the first-class batting averages, scoring 907 runs at an average of 36.28. His highest score was 205 not out for an England XI against Cambridge University, the third-highest score of the season after W. G. Grace's two triple centuries.Green, p. 93. His innings lasted about seven hours, and he batted on each of the three days of the match. This was his maiden first-class century; he scored another hundred later in the season when he made 143 runs for a combined Kent and Gloucestershire side against a team representing England. In the same season he took 28 wickets at an average of 19.64, including seven wickets for 65 runs in the match between the United South of England XI and the United North of England XI. Decline and disgrace Over the next few seasons Gilbert was not as successful with the bat; in 1877 he failed to exceed 47 in any innings, he scored about half the number of runs that he had during the previous year, and his average dropped to 15.70. His average remained below 20 in four of the next five seasons and never passed 23. In six seasons, he scored only six fifties. On the other hand, he took 56 wickets in both 1877 and 1878, averaging under 17 with the ball. He achieved some notable performances as a bowler, including bowling unchanged throughout a game in partnership with W. G. Grace. But from 1879 he bowled less frequently, and never passed 23 wickets in a season again. Even so, Gilbert represented the Gentlemen against the Players twice in 1877, his final appearances in the fixture; in four games, he scored just 43 runs and took 16 wickets. By this time Gilbert faced financial difficulty as an amateur cricketer. Most amateurs were from privileged backgrounds, whereas professionals mainly came from the working class. It was almost unthinkable for an amateur to become a professional,Green, p. 69. although many did receive financial inducements such as generous expenses and sinecure positions within county organisations. Unlike the Grace brothers, Gilbert did not have a profession outside cricket to provide a supplementary income allowing him to live comfortably. A solution seemed to arrive in 1880, when Fred Grace, the manager of the United South of England XI touring side and one of W. G. Grace's brothers, died and Gilbert took over his paid job as secretary.Green, p. 96. But the popularity of professional touring teams was already in decline, and the increasing number of matches between county teams attracted more interest. An indication of trouble came in 1882 when a professional cricketer took Gilbert to court over unpaid fees for an appearance in a match.Green, pp. 96–97. In three seasons between 1883 and 1885 Gilbert's batting form improved somewhat. Appearing mainly for Gloucestershire, Gilbert increased his first-class batting average beyond 20, and in 1885 he hit his third first-class century when he scored 102 against Yorkshire. At the start of the 1886 season Gilbert was featured in the popular biographical article in the weekly magazine Cricket, a significant accolade suggesting that he was highly regarded.Green, p. 97. A few days after the article's appearance Gilbert announced that he would in future play for Gloucestershire as a professional, but after only one appearance for the county he disappeared from first-class cricket. Official sources, including Cricket magazine in which Gilbert had recently been featured, James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual and Wisden Cricketers' Almanack offered no explanation. Wisden ended its match report on Gilbert's only professional appearance: \\"... about [Gilbert's] subsequent disappearance from cricket there is no need to speak\\". Gilbert had also been engaged by a club called East Gloucestershire, based in Cheltenham, which played minor cricket. The explanation for Gilbert's disappearance was to be found in a match he played for the club on 4 and 5 June 1886. Before the second day's play, Gilbert arrived early at the ground and went into the pavilion. Because several sums of money had recently gone missing from the pavilion, a policeman was hidden in the team's dressing room and he saw Gilbert searching clothes and stealing money. On being confronted, Gilbert produced the coins, one of which had been marked so that it could be identified.Green, p. 98. The East Gloucestershire match continued, but Gilbert's name was omitted from the published scorecard; the wickets he had taken on the first day were credited to \\"Smith\\", and either only ten players were listed or Gilbert's position in the batting order was taken by \\"Mr E. L. Even\\", who did not bat. Gilbert had been selected for Gloucestershire's first-class match against Sussex on 7 June, but he was dropped from the side and his place taken by a player making his only appearance in the side. Gilbert was in Police Court while the match was taking place, charged with theft. He admitted stealing from two men and expressed remorse. According to the report in The Times, he stated that if he were forgiven, he would move to Australia; his solicitor argued that Gilbert had been \\"harassed and worried\\" for some time and was suffering from erysipelas and could barely control his own behaviour. His solicitor requested that any punishment should allow Gilbert to go overseas, but Gilbert was sentenced to 28 days imprisonment. Gilbert's family then arranged for him to move to Canada; at the time it was common for families to send disgraced members to distant parts of the British Empire to minimise scandal. In first-class cricket, Gilbert scored 5,290 runs at an average of 19.16 with three hundreds. With the ball, he took 295 wickets at an average of 17.93. His Wisden obituary stated: \\"His fielding at deep-leg to W. G. Grace's bowling was always excellent, for he covered much ground and was a sure catch. Although overshadowed by his famous cricketing cousins, he played a prominent part in the victories gained during Gloucestershire's greatest years.\\" Final years In Canada Gilbert found employment with the Land Titles Office in Calgary, for whom he worked for 17 years. Cricket historian Benny Green wrote: \\"No breath of scandal or disgrace ever attached to Gilbert's thirty-eight years of exile, nor was there found to be even one square inch missing from the Land Titles Office when Gilbert finally retired from it.\\" Gilbert had four children from his marriage to the daughter of cricketer James Lillywhite senior. His son was killed in the First World War, flying with the Royal Flying Corps, and his three daughters joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. He continued to play cricket and became one of Canada's leading cricketers. Gilbert died in Calgary on 24 April 1924, aged 70. Continued controversy After Gilbert's retirement, and even following his death, controversy remained attached to his name; there seemed to be a conspiracy of silence surrounding his fate.Green, p. 95. Cricket historians rarely mentioned him, despite his varied career. W. G. Grace, although including Gilbert in an appendix of leading batsmen in his 1891 book Cricket, did not include him in the text at all, despite the book's more than 400 pages; in his Cricketers I Have Met, Grace described 121 cricketers but did not mention his cousin. Further evidence of Gilbert's disgrace came in the pages of Wisden. Although Gilbert began as an amateur cricketer, which entitled him to have \\"Mr.\\" before his name in the \\"Births and Deaths\\" section, he was referred to until his death as \\"Gilbert, W. R.\\", which denoted a professional. However, in his Wisden obituary he received the title \\"Mr. W. R. Gilbert\\", even though the \\"Births and Deaths\\" still listed him as a professional,Green, pp. 93–94. and in 1935 he was once again restored to amateur status in \\"Births and Deaths\\", for reasons which are unclear. The same obituary glossed over Gilbert's enforced retirement from cricket, simply observing: \\"At the beginning of 1886 he became a professional, and the season was not far advanced before his career in first-class cricket ended abruptly. He then left England for Canada.\\" Even in 1970, the silence continued; historian Rowland Bowen wrote about the story but concluded by saying: \\"Another indication of the recurring instinct for suppression was a suggestion to me that if this story had not appeared in print before (it has not) it should not now.\\" It is not clear who made this suggestion, whether it was descendants of the Grace family, a cricket administrator or someone else.Green, pp. 95–96. It was not until 1984 that the full story was published by historian Robert Brook. In reviewing what he considered to be the injustice of the case, and reflecting on Gilbert's success in Canada, Green wrote: \\"No wonder that those responsible for this act of appalling cruelty went to such fatuous lengths to keep its details a secret.\\" Notes References Bibliography * English cricketers Gloucestershire cricketers Middlesex cricketers 1853 births 1924 deaths Gentlemen cricketers Gentlemen of the South cricketers North v South cricketers United South of England Eleven cricketers British people convicted of theft English emigrants to Canada Gentlemen of England cricketers Over 30s v Under 30s cricketers Grace family W.

The episode was written by Dan Fybel & Rich Rinaldi and directed by Wes Archer. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed by 4.87 million viewers in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Toby Huss, Larry Murphy, Andy Kindler, Jerry Minor, Sam Seder, Holly Schlesinger and Wendy Molyneux. Plot As the episode begins, Linda is getting ready to go out for the evening. She tells Bob she is going to a strip club with her friends, but Bob does not believe her and eventually gets her to admit she is really going to a dinner theater. Bob hates dinner theater, especially since every time Linda goes to one she spends the next week communicating only in song, which Bob finds annoying. The next morning, favorite customer Mort (Andy Kindler), also a fan of dinner theater, tells Linda since she works at a restaurant she could set up a dinner theater of her own. Linda is excited, but Bob objects, finally relenting as long as there are only three performances. Linda concocts a mass murder-mystery-musical-love story set in a morgue and titles it \\"Dreamatorium.\\" She casts the kids, Mort and herself in the play, but Bob refuses to take part beyond making the food. Tina is cast as a tree due to a history of stage fright. The kids make the set and Mort creates the props. On the night of the play, Mort's death is accompanied by gory, overly realistic fake blood and organs, and the audience is appalled, some even calling the police, who briefly investigate the show. Linda decides to do another performance, much to Bob's dismay. Tina wants to say a line to conquer her stage fright, but during the performance she freezes, and Louise says her line. At the climax, Linda reveals that she committed the murders, although in the prologue she said her character was not the killer; she says it is a twist ending, but the audience angrily disagrees. Suddenly a robber (Toby Huss) appears with a gun and demands all the money in the cash register. Realizing that they are putting on a show, the robber sings beautifully to Linda, who improvises lyrics in return. Bob protests that the robber is not part of the show, but no one believes him. Even the police drive by, see the robbery, and drive on, assuming it is staged for the play. The robber leaves with the money as everybody praises his performance. Bob reports the crime the next day to Officers Julia and Cliffany (Jerry Minor & Sam Seder) while Mort reads positive reviews to Linda. A blond man walks in the restaurant, asking about the robbery. Once the police are gone, he reveals himself to be the robber and offers to appear in the show again for the third and final performance. Linda is all for it, but Bob calls 911, so the robber produces the gun, robs them again, and flees, only to be caught by Officers Julia and Cliffany. Linda is disappointed and upset with Bob. She is dispirited during the last performance, especially since the audience cannot wait for the \\"twist ending\\" of the robbery. When the play finishes, the viewers are disgruntled when the special star does not appear. Bob disguises himself and performs the role of the robber, and he and Linda improvise a brief song, concluding to discover everyone has left the restaurant. Tina finally spits out her one line, and declares that she is cured of her stage fright. Reception In its original American broadcasting, \\"Hamburger Dinner Theater\\" was viewed by an estimated 4.81 million viewers and received a 2.7 rating/4% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, an increase than last week's episode. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying \\"I'm happy that Linda gets to be the focus of the episode, as a bit too often she slides over into the “nagging wife” category of cartoon characters. Bob's easy interactions with the other characters, including his wife, are also probably the show's strength. If this episode has a weakness, it's that Louise is somewhat sidelined, with her Canada-hatred and all. Still, this kind of show, focusing on the family's often-hilarious interactions with one another, is the Bob's Burgers I've been waiting for. I hope that this is the turning point towards something great.\\" References  External links  2011 American television episodes Bob's Burgers (season 1) episodes ","title":"Hamburger Dinner Theater"},{"id":"31458892","text":"David Bond is an English journalist, who was sports editor of BBC News, from 2009–2014.

They brought with them their interest in astronomy. At first, astronomical thought in America was based on Aristotelian philosophy. England's Expedition to the Outer Banks During a British expedition to North Carolina's Outer Banks in the 1580s, astronomer and mathematician Thomas Harriot looked to the stars to determine why many of the natives that came in contact with the Europeans had died mysteriously. He determined that it was not the solar eclipse that he observed on their voyage to the new world nor the comet that appeared during his time on the island. His 1588 Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia hints that instead of finding the answer in the heavens, it was the cruel treatment of the English toward the natives. He also mentioned a \\"perspective glass whereby we shewed manie strange sights.\\" This was most likely a magnifying lens. Harriot later became one of the first users of the telescope after returning to England and rendered a drawing of the moon four months before Galileo. Harvard College and Astronomy In the Massachusetts Bay Colony, during the Puritan migration, a seminary of learning was established in 1636 known as New Cambridge. Many of its tutors came from Oxford and Cambridge Universities in England. New Cambridge, like its English predecessors, was saturated in Aristotelian metaphysics and logic. In 1639, it became known as Harvard College. The first president of Harvard and lone instructor for a period, Henry Dunster, taught his students the \\"astronomy of the ancients\\". The Earth was the center of the universe while nine transparent spherical orbs revolved around it. Based on very meager information, Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker suggests in The First Americans that Copernican astronomy, although not taught formally until later, started to emerge at Harvard College in 1670. In 1671 a physics class refused to read an assigned text that supported the Ptolemaic system. However, as early as 1659, one Harvard graduate, Zachariah Brigden, began to promote the new astronomy in the New England almanacs. Most astrological information came to the people by way of these almanacs. Astronomical almanacs Interest in astronomy was evident as early as 1638 with the initiation of the first American printing press at Harvard College. In 1639, Stephen Daye began to print in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the first series of almanacs published in the Thirteen American Colonies, An Almanack Calculated for New England, by William Pierce.(1) (2) (3) (4) . (5) During the seventeenth century, astronomical almanacs began to appear in the American colonies, especially New England. These almanacs contained phases of the moon, tide tables, best times to plant, and the setting of religious holidays. They also contained pieces on the celestial sphere. The Puritans believed that God was a great geometer and He revealed himself through mathematics which propagated His intricately rational plan. This scientific doctrine of the Puritans was an \\"assertion that the cultivated mind... is competent to gather accurate knowledge of things... because the mind is fundamentally commensurate with creation.\\" This way of thinking encouraged New England almanac writers to accept the new astronomy. New England almanacs were compiled by young Harvard graduates who used them as a vehicle for popular essays on Copernican astronomy. This included, Zachariah Brigden from Connecticut, who wrote about the revolution of the six planets around the sun, the four satellites around Jupiter and the two satellites around Saturn in The New England Almanack of the Coelestial Motions for this Present Year of the Christian AEra 1659. Brigden had access to English almanac-maker and astronomer Vincent Wing's 1656 Astronomia Instraurata. Wing was the first to put the discoveries of Copernicus, Galileo, and Kelper into English. He published astronomical tables that made predicting eclipses more accessible. Brigden opens the almanac with a quote from Wing \\"Twice shall this planet wheron we live, and it’s concomitant the moon, widdow each other of their Sun- derived luster.\\" He ends the almanac with a short concise account of the Copernican system. This was most likely the first scientific essay written in the American colony. One thing that remained in the Ptolemaic system for Brigden was the sphere of the fixed stars. There was also an uneasiness regarding the Bible as a barrier to the Copernican system. A copy of this almanac was sent to the Puritan clergy John Davenport of New Haven by John Winthrop the Younger. Davenport responded with a letter to Winthrop stating that although he does not agree with Brigden, he entitled Brigden to his opinion. Davenport showed lenience by not putting him on the Puritan index expurgatorius or expelling his membership from the church. In the 1661 almanac, Harvard graduate Samuel Cheever, printed theories from Galileo, Boulliau, Gassendi, and Kepler and promoted the Copernican hypotheses. Harvard graduate, Thomas Brattle prepared An Almanack of Coelestial Motions of the Sun and Planets with their Principal Aspects for the year 1678, with work arranged in advance making it evident that Brattle \\"prepared his dissertation by computing the elements necessary to solar and planetary data.\\" These very rare booklets reveal the astronomical information that was held by the colonists' intellectual class. They also contained practical information such as the rising and setting of the sun and moon, guiding the scholar and the mariner, location of the planets and stars in conjunction and opposition, and providing longitude and latitude. The almanacs correctly predicted eclipses of the sun and moon, and provided an abundance of meteorological and historical data. Often found on the final pages of the almanac were brief articles that promoted the new astronomy. Royal Society Fellows in Colonial America In England the Royal Society was paving the way for new scientific thought which in turn reached its American colonies. The Royal Society fashioned its reputation by vigilantly developing and maintaining its membership as an assembly of gentlemen. \\"The reliable witnessing of experiments by gentlemen was the only sure way to establish matters of fact about the physical realm.\\" With a list of members in the Society that included eighteen Americans, it is obvious that the Royal Society had a major influence in scientific development in the colonies in a variety of fields. The Royal Society encouraged their Fellows to participate in the scientific process by asking them to record the weather and share astronomical observations as well as any other events of scientific interest. John Winthrop the Younger, son of the first Massachusetts governor, John Winthrop, was among the original members. Winthrop was temporarily residing in London when he was elected in 1663 as the first colonist elected Fellow and western correspondent. He was a man of great learning with an education in law who also mastered most of the new sciences. Winthrop's collection of books he brought back to America was remarkable. He is credited as being the first chemist and metallurgist in the American colonies while he practiced alchemy and medicine. Winthrop also studied astronomy with his foot refracting telescope. In 1664, he wrote a letter to Sir Robert Moray regarding a \\"fifth satellite of Jupiter\\" that he believed he observed. This was only fifty years after Galileo discovered the first four moons of Jupiter. His letter was cautious since he thought it may be a faint star in close proximity to the other satellites. Winthrop requested that his observations be validated by Lawrence Rooke, Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College, but nothing was verified. Dr. Edward Emerson Barnard, who was credited for discovering Amalthea, Jupiter's fifth moon, wrote \\"It makes me feel specially humiliated just now, for I have only caught the feeblest glimpses of the 5th satellite with the 40-inch during the past two years. Winthrop’s telescope must have been specially good for him to see this faint object with his imperfect instrument in 1664.\\" Although today it is assumed that Winthrop probably did see a faint star, he is still credited for being a dedicated and vigilant observer of natural phenomenon. \\"An exceptionally talented Puritan intellectual whose work in mathematics and astronomy was sought after by the scientific elite on both sides of the Atlantic\\" describes Royal Society Fellow Thomas Brattle who devoted much of his wealth to the pursuit of science. Not only did Brattle prepare almanacs, he also made celestial observations. For his keen observation of the Comet of 1680, Brattle was given a favorable mention in Sir Isaac Newton's Principia. He also speculated, independently of John Flamsteed, that even though the comet appeared to be two, it was a single comet that changed direction. His observation of a solar eclipse in 1694 was published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. John Winthrop, grandson to John Winthrop the Younger, became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1734. He collected geological specimens and demonstrated skills in classification and cataloging. In the area of astronomy, Winthrop observed the 1761 transit of Venus in St. Johns, Newfoundland. His observations and recorded data were published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. National Portrait Gallery1796 portrait of David Rittenhouse by Charles Willson Peale Royal Society Fellow and an original member of the American Philosophical Society founded in 1741, David Rittenhouse, not only mastered Newton’s Principia as a teenager, he built clocks, orreries, and other scientific devices. It is believed that he built the first telescope and observatory in America. It was in this observatory on his farm that Rittenhouse observed the 1769 Venus Transit.. His account was published in the American Philosophical Society's Transactions.

The ‘Puritan and Science’ Thesis In her article Puritanism and the New Philosophy in 17th Century England (1935), Dorothy Stimson argued that the primary ingredient in the philosophical changes started by Francis Bacon was Puritanism. This argument was supported in Ancients and Moderns (1936) by Richard Foster Jones and ‘Puritanism, Pietism and Science’ (1938) by Robert K. Merton. Merton noted that there was a disproportional number of Puritan Fellows in the Royal Society compared to the English population. He also summoned the thesis of Max Weber connecting \\"the Protestant work ethic\\" with the rise of capitalism. The argument was that scientific pursuits were a type of \\"good work\\" and therefore a sign of election. \\"This-worldly asceticism which inspired Puritans to greater economic activity also motivated them to diligent and painstaking scientific enquiry.\\" In 1975, Charles Webster builds on the argument in The Great Instauration: Science, Medicine and Reform, 1626-1660, claiming that the prevailing factor in English society in the mid-1600s was Puritanism and its relationship with the growth of the English scientific movement was extremely close. A longing to discern the universe's composition and reveal the force of the \\"Great Geometer\\" provided a sense of wonder at the universe's immensity and intricacy. Exploring \\"God’s great mechanism\\" was the perfect \\"good work\\" for the Puritan.

Al-Farabi expanded on Plato's concept of an ideal city ruled by philosopher-kings to develop a political philosophy that could accommodate the religious and cultural diversity central to Islamic nations.Druart, Thérèse-Anne. \\"Philosophy in Islam.\\" In The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Philosophy. Ed. A. S. McGrade. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003. Pp. 103-104 On the other hand, both al- Ghazali and Ibn Rushd vigorously opposed Neoplatonic views. The characteristic of Neoplatonic thought in Islamic theology is that of emanation, linking God's transcendence with the corporeal reality of his creation. Islamic Neoplatonism was introduced by Al-Farabi, although Avicenna proved to have the greater influence. Both authors present a complex scheme of emanation. Islamic Neoplatonism was allowed to flourish in the tenth to early eleventh century, but there was a strong reaction against it in the later eleventh century, especially from Al-Ghazali, who represents Islamic theology's \\"most biting attack on philosophy\\" at the time, and the severest reaction to Neoplatonism in particular (Netton 1998). Al-Ghazali's criticism evoked a counter-reaction by Ibn Rushd, who wrote a \\"systematic rebuttal of al-Ghazali's critique of Greco-Arab philosophy\\".Fakhry, A History of Islamic Philosophy, 1983, p. 276. While Ibn Rushd is trying to defend the possibility of philosophical thought as non-heretical, he does at the same time himself reject the theses of the Neoplatonist philosophers.'more often than not...does not, in fact, defend al- Farabi and Ibn Sina.... Instead, he shows to what extent they have departed from the authentic Aristotelian philosophical doctrines, and sometimes joins his voice with that of Ghazali in convicting them of heresy' (Bello 1989: 15). After the death of Ibn Rushd in 1198, the debate on Neoplatonism in Islam mostly comes to an end, and survival of Neoplatonic thought within Islam was mostly limited to Ismailism.

Elliott is a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly representing Baulkham Hills for the Liberal Party since 2011. Elliott was Minister for Counter Terrorism from January 2017 until March 2019 and Minister for Corrections and Minister for Veterans Affairs from April 2015 until March 2019 in the first Berejiklian ministry. He was Minister for Emergency Services between 2015 and 2017 in the second Baird government. Early years and background In 1995, Elliott joined the Australian Army and commenced his officer training at Royal Military College, Duntroon, attaining the rank of Captain in April 1997. Taking 18 months' leave, he worked as Press Secretary for the Hon. Peter Collins, QC MP who was elected NSW Leader of the Opposition following the 1995 state election. During 1999, Elliott was Director for the Australians for Constitutional Monarchy campaign against the referendum for Australia to become a republic; for which he was awarded the Centenary Medal on 1 January 2001 for service to the constitutional reform debate. Returning to the Army in 2000, Elliott served in peace-keeping forces in Bouganville, Papua New Guinea and was awarded the Australian Service Medal. For the next four years, Elliott worked as state operations manager in St John Ambulance (NSW), before commencing as Executive Officer of the Australian Hotels Association, and later becoming Deputy chief executive officer. In 2008, Elliott became chief executive officer of the Civil Contractors Federation and held this position until his election to Parliament. Elliott was a director of Castle Hill RSL Club Limited from 2009 to 2016. Elliott was a director of Life Education Australia between 2009 and 2011, and a member of Sydney Chamber of Commerce from 2008 to 2011. Between 1992 and 2001, he has held a range of Liberal Party elected positions. Political career On 16 June 2007, Elliott sought Liberal Party pre-selection for the federal seat of Mitchell, but lost by a margin of 20 votes to 81 against Alex Hawke, then an advisor to Ray Williams MP. Paul Blanch, a grazier from Orange, received 8 votes. Alan Cadman, who had been the member for Mitchell since 1974, chose not to contest the pre-selection, but was later quoted as saying that this was due to \\"relentless branch-stacking within the electorate.\\" In February 2010, Elliott unsuccessfully sought Liberal Party pre-selection for the Legislative Council of New South Wales in a bitter and public battle with David Clarke, a member of the Liberal's so called 'religious right' faction. Following the announcement of the retirement of sitting Liberal member, Wayne Merton, Elliott won party pre-selection, running against Baulkham Hills Councillor Mike Thomas and solicitor, Damien Tudehope. At the 2011 election, Elliott was elected to the safe Liberal seat with a swing of 14.4 points and won the seat with 76.4 per cent of the two-party vote. Elliott's main opponent was Tony Hay, representing Labor. Following the 2015 state election, Elliott was sworn in as the Minister for Emergency Services, the Minister for Corrections, and the Minister for Veterans Affairs in the second Baird government. On 30 January 2017, Elliott was sworn in as the Minister for Counter-Terrorism, the Minister for Corrections, and the Minister for Veterans Affairs in the first Berejiklian ministry. On 18 October 2018 Elliott used parliamentary privilege in the Legislative Assembly to raise an allegation that Luke Foley, at the time leader of the opposition, had \\"a little bit too much to drink at a party and harassed an ABC journalist.\\" Later that month, ABC journalist Ashleigh Raper released a statement, alleging that at an event in November 2016, Foley \\"placed his hand down the back of her dress and inside her underpants.\\" Hours later, Foley read a statement in which he resigned as leader of the Labor Party, but denied the allegation and said he would commence defamation proceedings in the Federal Court. Following the 2019 state election, Elliott was sworn in as the Minister for Police and Emergency Services in the second Berejiklian ministry, with effect from 2 April 2019.  Controversies  In November 2019, Elliott was cleared by police following an investigation into an alleged road rage incident involving a 17-year-old P-plate driver. Elliot had told the P-plate driver he \\"worked for the cops\\". Also in November 2019, Elliott responded to revelations police strip-searched 122 girls by stating he would want officers to search his own children if \\"they were at risk of doing something wrong\\". In December 2019, he attracted attention for an offensive post on Facebook, in which he told a \\"mate\\" that he'd \\"rip your head off and s--- in the hole\\". In December 2019, Elliot was denounced for deciding to take a holiday to Europe during one of the worst bushfire disasters in the country's history. He faced heavy criticism because of his sitting role as New South Wales Emergency Services Minister, with New South Wales by far the worst hit area of the country with almost a thousand houses destroyed, a billion animals killed or displaced in bushfires throughout NSW. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-09/nsw-bushfires-kill-over-a-billion- animals-experts- say/11854836#:~:text=Over%20a%20billion%20animals%20have,according%20to%20leading%20wildlife%20experts. and nine people killed (including three firefighters). This was not helped by the fact that just a week earlier, the federal Liberal Party leader and Prime Minister Scott Morrison faced similar criticism for going on a holiday to Hawaii. Elliott responded to the claims stating he would keep bushfire affected communities and firefighters in his thoughts whilst on holiday. After public pressure and criticism following catastrophic fires on 31 December 2019 David Elliott \\"apparently\\" backflipped and returned home from his European trip. On 9 March 2020, the NSW Police announced an investigation into whether Elliott's use of highly restricted firearms broke the law.

A lifelong Philadelphian, Eckfeldt served as the second chief coiner of the Mint, from 1814 until 1839. Eckfeldt's father owned a large smithy and involved himself in early attempts at American coinage. Adam Eckfeldt built early presses for the Mint, engraved some of its early dies, and was responsible for the designs of early American copper coinage, as well as the 1792 half disme which some authorities consider the first United States coin. He was appointed assistant coiner of the Mint in 1796, and became chief coiner on his predecessor's death in 1814. Eckfeldt served a quarter century as chief coiner, during which time the Philadelphia Mint moved to new premises. As he set aside unusual coins brought in as bullion, he started the Mint's coin cabinet, which evolved into the National Numismatic Collection. Even after his 1839 retirement, Eckfeldt continued to perform the duties of chief coiner; his death in 1852 caused his replacement, Franklin Peale, to seek an assistant.  Early life  John Adam Eckfeldt was born in Philadelphia on June 15, 1769, the son of John Jacob Eckfeldt, a large-scale manufacturer of edge-tools and implements. At the time, it was common for those of German descent to bear the first name \\"John\\" but be referred to by middle name. The elder Eckfeldt and his wife Maria Magdalena had immigrated from Nuremberg, Bavaria, around 1764. John Jacob Eckfeldt, in his large smithy, made dies for the 1783 coinage under the Articles of Confederation authorized by Philadelphia financier Robert Morris. Adam was his father's apprentice, and became skilled in iron work and machinery.  Coin designer and Mint official  Inspecting the First Coins by John Dunsmore. Eckfeldt is dressed in blue, just to the right of the seated Martha Washington. During Eckfeldt's childhood, the thirteen British colonies along the Atlantic coast of what is now the United States revolted, and so the United States of America secured its independence. After the United States Constitution was ratified, Congress and many government offices came to be housed in Philadelphia, including the newborn Mint of the United States. Adam Eckfeldt built the first screw press for the new facility in 1792, the same year that the Mint Act of 1792 was passed by Congress authorizing a mint, and cut the obverse die for the experimental Birch cent of that year. He also built other machinery for the Mint, and helped superintend the early coining. Eckfeldt's 1792 press, displayed beneath the Dunsmore painting depicting him In 1792, the Mint acquired three balances from Eckfeldt, who also lent the Mint his lathe (used for turning dies). Eckfeldt is believed to have made the die from which the 1792 half disme, considered by some the first official U.S. coin, was struck—in 1829, a visitor to the Mint met Eckfeldt and later described him as \\"an artist [who] made the first die used in it\\". Other later accounts document Eckfeldt's role in this striking: an 1863 auction sold a half disme supposedly given by Eckfeldt to demonstrate his work. Eckfeldt is given as the source for the tradition that the half dismes were struck at the request of President George Washington to be used as presents. Eckfeldt operated his screw press to strike these roughly 1,500 pieces on July 13, 1792. Since the first Philadelphia Mint was still under construction at the time, these coins were produced in the cellar of John Harper, saw maker, at Sixth and Cherry Streets in Philadelphia. In his annual message to Congress late that year, Washington noted the ongoing construction of a mint building and stated: \\"There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dismes, the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them.\\" The obverse of the 1792 half disme Eckfeldt also produced a pattern disme, of which only a few were struck. When the Mint's first cents (produced in 1793) were found to be excessively crude and attracted public ridicule, Eckfeldt was called upon to design replacements. He placed a wreath on the back of the cent instead of the original chain, and placed a trefoil under Liberty's head on the obverse. He also engraved the first half cent dies later the same year. Eckfeldt continued to work intermittently for the Philadelphia Mint; in 1793, he built a device for automatically feeding planchets into the die collar and ejecting the struck coins, and the mint's records reveal that he did piecework there in July 1795. By October 1795 he was on the mint's payroll, as a die forger and turner, at a salary of $500 per year. On January 1, 1796, Mint Director Elias Boudinot appointed him as assistant coiner, with the consent of President Washington. His duties in that capacity were broad. In 1805, at Boudinot's request, Eckfeldt eliminated a security problem for the Mint by renting two houses adjacent to its operations, allowing it to shut an internal alley to public access. The following year, new Mint Director Robert Patterson requested a pay increase of $200 for Eckfeldt, writing to President Thomas Jefferson that Eckfeldt had \\"the management of the whole coining department\\". When the dies used proved too brittle and cracked easily, Eckfeldt came up with the idea of spraying water on the face of the die so the steel would temper evenly. As a boy, inventor George Escol Sellers knew Eckfeldt; as Sellers's father was partner in a firm which sold machinery to the Mint Bureau, Eckfeldt often dined at his house. In the final years both of the 19th century and of Sellers's life, he published his memoirs, including memories of the first Philadelphia Mint. He recalled in 1812 peering through a window to see cents coined, and Eckfeldt coming into the room to stop the work at the end of the day. Seeing the young Sellers, he had the boy come in, had him place a cent planchet on the press, and struck it for him. Sellers nearly dropped it because it was so hot, and Eckfeldt reminded him it had been cold when placed in the press. Eckfeldt bade him keep the coin until he learned why the cent had become hot, and then he could spend it on candy.  Chief coiner  Silver replica of retirement medal for Eckfeldt, by Moritz Fuerst On the death of the first chief coiner, Henry Voigt, in early 1814, Eckfeldt was appointed by President James Madison as successor. He served in that capacity for a quarter century. During his tenure, he continued to improve the machinery at the Philadelphia Mint. Eckfeldt set aside \\"master coins\\"—coins struck with extra care using new dies and polished planchets. He also put aside interesting foreign coins sent to the mint as bullion. These pieces became the Mint's Cabinet, or coin collection. To fill gaps in this collection, he used old dies to strike postdated coins. Specialists have discovered that some dies he chose for this purpose had not been used together to strike coins for commerce, thus creating unique specimens. Among the pieces acquired for the Mint was a Brasher doubloon, of which only six are known today. Eckfeldt often spent from his own funds to acquire the coins for the Mint. The collection eventually evolved into the Smithsonian Institution's National Numismatic Collection. In 1828, Eckfeldt again became involved in the real estate transactions to expand operations at the Philadelphia Mint. For $1,000, he purchased one of the lots he had rented in 1805. After the mint moved to new premises in the 1830s, Eckfeldt discovered that the lot he had purchased had a cloud, or irregularity, on its title; he was able to clear it and sold it in 1837 for the same sum for which he had bought it. The new mint building was at Juniper and Chestnut Streets, only six blocks from Eckfeldt's home at Juniper and Vine. Sellers, in his memoirs, described Eckfeldt as \\"a man of staunch integrity, a cautious, careful, orderly and painstaking man; he was not one of the dashing, pushing, inventive mechanics, though under his care many apparently slight improvements were gradually adopted that in the aggregate amounted to a great deal in the economy of working. He was by no means deficient in inventive ability.\\" Nevertheless, as Eckfeldt aged in the service of the Mint in the late 1820s and into the 1830s, he was reluctant to adopt the innovations being proposed by his fellow Mint officer, Melter and Refiner Franklin Peale. Peale, like Eckfeldt of a mechanical bent, had many suggestions for improvements to the coinage machinery, some of which Eckfeldt adopted. Eckfeldt stated to Sellers, \\"If Mr. Peale had full swing he would turn everything upside down\\". According to Sellers, \\"the giving up of almost life-long pets that had been Mr. Eckfeldt's constant care would naturally go hard, and still harder coming from another department, but as improvements gradually crept in and proved their efficiency Mr. Eckfeldt gave full credit where it belonged, and I remember him becoming quite enthusiastic over the labor saving [in the use of the Contamin portrait lathe] in duplicating working dies\\". The actual gold medal presented to Eckfeldt in 1839 In 1833, Peale was sent on a tour of European mints and came home with ideas for new machines and innovations, including the introduction of steam power, used at Britain's Royal Mint since 1810 on equipment purchased from the firm of Boulton & Watt. Although Eckfeldt would have preferred to apply steam to the existing coin presses, a new one was built for steam power, and commemorative medals were the first pieces struck by steam at the Philadelphia Mint, in early 1836. In 1839, Eckfeldt retired after 25 years as chief coiner and over forty as a Mint employee. His fellow officers at the Mint presented him with a gold medal, with silver and bronze duplicates also struck. The obverse was designed by Philadelphia engraver Moritz Fuerst, who sometimes did work for the Mint; the reverse may be by Fuerst or by Peale. Eckfeldt recommended Peale as his successor, and Peale was appointed. Nevertheless, Eckfeldt continued to perform the functions of chief coiner without pay until a few days before his death on February 6, 1852. After Eckfeldt's death, Peale wrote what Taxay terms a \\"frantic letter\\" to Mint Director George N. Eckert, seeking the appointment of an assistant. Peale had spent the freed-up time designing and selling medals for private gain.  Private and family life  Reverse of Eckfeldt retirement medal Eckfeldt married twice. No children were born of his brief first marriage in 1792 to Maria Hahn, which ended with her death; his second marriage to Margaretta Bausch produced six children. Among them were his daughter Susanna, who married William Ewing DuBois, first curator of the Mint's coin collection. Jacob Reese Eckfeldt, one of Adam's sons, was for forty years (1832–1872) Assayer of the United States Mint. Jacob's son Jacob Branch Eckfeldt exceeded both forebears in time of service, working at the Mint for 64 years, from 1865 to 1929. Adam Eckfeldt had a taste for horticulture and owned rural property in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, which was inherited by his two sons after his death. He was the first president of the Good Will Fire Company, holding that office for nearly all of his adult life, and designed a system of levers for use in fire engines. A member of Concordia Lodge No. 67 of the Masonic Order from 1795 to 1806, he served as lodge master in 1803; a Chinese export porcelain punch bowl with his name and Masonic symbols survives in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

Born in Cervera, he was an illegitimate son of Ferdinand II of Aragon by a Catalan noblewoman called Aldonza Ruiz de Ivorra (1452–1516). In his youth his tutor was Antonio Geraldini, brother of the humanist scholar Alessandro Geraldini.  Ecclesiastical career  Alonso was more a politician than a clergyman. His ecclesiastical career was determined by his father when he was five years old; his half-uncle, Juan de Aragón, Archbishop of Zaragoza and illegitimate son of King John II of Aragon, died. Ferdinand II decided that Alonso would succeed him, but Pope Sixtus IV thought that he was too young and appointed Ausías de Puggio. By 1478, the Pope couldn't withstand the pressure any more and appointed Alonso as new Archbishop on 14 August. However, he was not ordained as a priest until 7 November 1501, a day before being ordained as a bishop. On 23 January 1512, Alonso was appointed Archbishop of Valencia. He was enthroned as such on 4 April 1512.  Political career  His father made him Lieutenant General of the Kingdom of Naples in 1507, to replace Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba. In 1512, he was in command of the troops that conquered Tudela in the Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre. When his father died in 1516, the Archbishop was appointed by his will as Lieutenant General of Aragon and de facto ruler of Aragon, due to the insanity of his half-sister, Queen Joanna, who inherited the crown. When Joanna's son and co-ruler, Charles I, arrived in November 1518, the Archbishop was confirmed as Lieutenant General of Aragon. He died two years later in Lécera. Aragón also realised important modifications on the La Seo Cathedral, where he was buried.  Issue  Despite being Archbishop, Alonso had seven children with Ana de Gurrea (1470–1527), including: * Juan (1498–1530), next Archbishop of Zaragoza * Hernando (1498–1575), also Archbishop of Zaragoza and Viceroy of Aragón * Antonio (died 1552), Lord of Quinto * Juana (died 1520), married to Juan de Borja, 3rd Duke of Gandía and mother of Saint Francis Borgia * Martin, Lord of Argavieso * Ana, married the 5th and the 6th Duke of Medina Sidonia  Ancestry   Arms  File:Arms of Alonso of Aragon.svgFormer arms of Alonso of Aragon File:Coat of Arms of Archbishop Alonso of Aragon.svgArms as archbishop (and Lieutenant General)  References  * ancestry.com: Alonso of ARAGON * Fundación Casa Ducal de Medinaceli: Alonso de Aragón \\"Gran Bastardo de Aragón\\" * rodovid.org: Alonso de Aragón y Ruiz de Ivorra n. 1470 d. 24 febrero 1520 * Aldonza de Ivorra - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre * PhiloBiblon: Alfonso de Aragón y Ruiz de Ivorra  External links  *Archbishop Alfonso de Aragón 1470 births 1520 deaths Illegitimate children of Spanish monarchs Archbishops of Zaragoza Archbishops of Valencia Aragonese regents Viceroys of Aragon Alonso House of Trastámara ","title":"Alonso de Aragón"},{"id":"31459080","text":"Blood, Fire and Love is the first studio album released by Scottish heavy metal band The Almighty.

Bumastus is an extinct genus of corynexochid trilobites which existed from the Early Ordovician period to the Late Silurian period. They were relatively large trilobites, reaching a length of . They were distinctive for their highly globular, smooth-surfaced exoskeleton. They possessed well- developed, large compound eyes and were believed to have dwelled in shallow- water sediments in life. Bumastus fossils have been found in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. They are classified under the family Styginidae in the order Corynexochida. Description Bumastus is a large trilobite, reaching a length of . The body is oblong-oval, about twice as long as it is wide, It had a strongly convex profile, giving it its distinctive globular appearance. Like all trilobites, the body is divided into three functional segments known as tagmata (singular: tagma), which in turn are divided into three lobes - the central lobe (axial) and two lateral lobes (pleural). Aside from faint depressions in the thorax, Bumastus is unusual in that the three lobes are barely discernible from each other. The axial lobe of Bumastus is also very broad in comparison to the pleural lobes. The cephalon (head segment) is very large and strongly convex. The facial sutures (the divisions by which the cephalon splits when the trilobite molts) is opisthoparian, with the suture ending along the hind cephalic margin. The genal angles of the cephalon - the edges where the lateral and rear margins of the cephalon meet - are rounded. The cephalon is effaced (smooth and mostly featureless), an evolutionary trend also seen in Illaenus and Trimerus, though not as pronounced as that of Bumastus. The glabella (the central lobe of the head) is almost fused to the fixigena. The thorax has ten narrow segments while the pygidium (the tail) is smooth and very rounded. It is isopygous - that is, the pygidium is about the same size as the cephalon. The pygidium completely lacks any visible trilobation. It is usually semicircular in shape but can be pointed in some species like B. niagarensis. The smooth compound eyes are large and peculiarly well-developed. This, along with the rounded contours of their body, suggests that Bumastus may have spent most of its time buried in sediment with its eyes protruding. The surface of the exoskeleton of most species is studded with minute punctures. 500px Paleoecology Side and ventral views of an enrolled specimen of Bumastus beckeri from Iowa. The rounded smooth shape of Bumastus, as well as the almost complete effacement of its cephalon, is believed to have been an adaptation for burrowing. The presence of well-developed eyes also suggest that it may have kept them above the substrate by burrowing into sediments backward. They are situated in such a way that they provide the trilobite with a semicircular field of vision on each side, keeping them aware of movements near them. artist's reconstruction of several individuals of Bumastus in shallow water. Bumastus were believed to have burrowed backwards into the sediment, leaving only their well-developed compound eyes exposed. Bumastus could also curl up (known as enrollment) into a ball-like shape. This is believed to indicate that its habitat might have been the shallow waters of the Littoral zone. When waves wash them out from the sediments it could simply roll up and be carried along. Enrollment protects the softer body parts below the exoskeleton, while the spherical shape offers the least resistance to wave action. Bumastus is a bottom- dwelling (nektobenthic) trilobite. It was probably either detritivorous, feeding on decomposing organic material drifting down in the currents, or carnivorous. Occurrence Bumastus existed during the Paleozoic era, from the Arenigian epoch of the Early Ordovician period to the Ludlow epoch of the Late Silurian period (approximately 478.6 ± 1.7 to 418.7 ± 2.8 million years ago). Their fossils can be found worldwide. Specimens have been recorded from the Silurian of Argentina, Canada, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greenland, Kazakhstan, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They can also be found in the Ordovician formations of Australia, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, the Russian Federation, Spain, the United States; with specific occurrences from the Dobrotivian age/stage (Llandeilo age) of China and France, and the Whiterockian stage of the United States. They are typically found in reef limestone, though they are sometimes found in crinoidal limestone. Discovery Bumastus was first described by the Scottish geologist, Sir Roderick Impey Murchison in 1839. The type species, Bumastus barriensis was recovered from the Coalbrookdale Formation of the Wenlock Group in England. Murchison first believed that the specimens he discovered (including a large by specimen) belonged to the genus Isotelus because of the size, shape, and almost featureless cephalon. But he noted the almost absent trilobation of body and the difference in the number of segments in the thorax (10 in B. barriensis and 8 in Isotelus). He also recognized its close relationship with the genus Illaenus, but ultimately classified it as a new genus based on the extremely advanced state of effacement in the cephalon of Bumastus. The genus is so named because of its curious resemblance to a large round grape. It comes from Latin būmastus (large grapes that resemble the udders of a cow), which in turn came from Greek βοῦς (bous - cow) and μαστός (mastós - breasts). The word was familiar in the English language during Murchison's time, being a word encountered in book two of Virgil's Georgics. The specific name of the type species, barriensis, roughly meaning \\"of Barr\\", comes from its common name among collectors. It was then known as the \\"Barr trilobite\\" referring to the plentiful occurrence of B. barriensis in the limestone formations of Great Barr, Staffordshire. Taxonomy Bumastus niagarensis from Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, has a more pointed pygidium. Bumastus ioxus from Middleport, New York in the Field Museum of Natural History. Bumastus is classified under the family Styginidae by P.A. Jell and J.M. Adrain in 2003, and under the order Corynexochida of trilobites by Jack Sepkoski in 2002.

Born of Irish immigrants in Chinguacousy, Upper Canada, the family farmed in the Glencoe area. His father, Nathaniel Currie Sn. petitioned for land in Mosa County, from York where he had originally petitioned for land in Upper Canada. Currie married Elizabeth Weeks in Mosa in 1845 having ten children together. He was buried in the Oakland Cemetery, Mosa, Row 11, no. 17 at age 74. As an early settler of Mosa Township, he became a Conservative provincial political figure and later Reeve of Glencoe village for many years. Reeve Currie, the unofficial founder of the village, is reputed to have upheld the Black Donnellys right to walk freely in the streets of Glencoe. He did not run in the election 1871 but did run again for the Provincial Legislature in 1882, losing to George William Ross by a vote of 1651-1597.

The bill stated that real property should be the basis of the vote and dual or plural votes per property should be allowed. Women of age holding property should be included in this vote. After much discussion the Farmers' Sons Franchise Act was passed in 1877, providing the vote to sons of land owners on the basis of property according to value, but not women.

Notes of Interest Nathaniel Currie was one of two justices involved in the Emma Rees case. Emma Rees was a lieutenant in the Glencoe Salvation Army in 1886. The Salvation Army was a target for local persecution while Emma Rees commanded a local detachment of the Army. A few residents of Glencoe, including some of the Donnelly clan, were fined and convicted for their activities against the Army and Emma Rees was fined for assault. Emma Rees appealed her conviction and charged Justices Simpson and Currie with unlawful arrest. She eventually won her suit and collected $700.

[Kuwait and her Neighbors], \\"George Allen & Unwin Ltd\\", 1956. pp. 300–302 The relationship between the House of Saud and the Ikhwan deteriorated into an open bloody feud in December 1928. The main instigators of the rebellion were defeated in the Battle of Sabilla, on 29 March 1929. Ikhwan tribesmen and troops loyal to Abd al-Aziz Ibn Saud clashed again in the Jabal Shammar region in August 1929, and Ikhwan tribesmen attacked the Awazim tribe on 5 October 1929. Faisal al-Dawish, the main leader of the rebellion and the Mutair tribe, fled to Kuwait in October 1929 before being detained by the British and handed over to Ibn Saud.Dickson Faisal Al- Dawish would die in Riyadh on 3 October 1931 from what appears to have been a heart condition. Government troops had finally suppressed the rebellion on 10 January 1930, when other Ikhwan rebel leaders surrendered to the British. In the aftermath, the Ikhwan leadership was slain, and the remains were eventually incorporated into regular Saudi units. Sultan bin Bajad, one of the three main Ikhwan leaders, was killed in 1931, while al-Dawish died in prison in Riyadh on 3 October 1931. Background At the beginning of the 20th century, Arabia was an arena of tribal wars, which had eventually led to unification under the leadership of Al Saud. The main tool for achieving these conquests was the Ikhwan, the Wahhabist-Bedouin tribal army led by Sultan bin Bajad al-Otaibi and Faisal al-Dawish.King Abdul Aziz Information Resource retrieved 19 January 2011'Arabian Sands' by Wilfred Thesiger, 1991 From the Saudi core in Nejd, and aided by the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War, the Ikhwan had completed the conquest of the territory that was to become Saudi Arabia by the end of 1925. On 10 January 1926 Abdul-Aziz declared himself King of the Hejaz and, then, on 27 January 1927 he took the title of King of Nejd (his previous title had been 'Sultan'). Undermining the authority of Ibn Saud After the conquest of the Hejaz, some Ikhwan leaders wanted to continue the expansion of the Wahhabist realm into the British protectorates of Transjordan, Iraq and Kuwait. The tribesmen had already tried to gain territory in the Kuwait-Najd Border War and raids on Transjordan, but they suffered heavy casualties. Defying Ibn Saud, elements of the Ikhwan, mainly consisting of the Mutair tribe under al-Dawish, launched a raid on southern Iraq on 5 November 1927, clashing with Iraqi troops near Busayya, resulting in some 20 casualties on both sides. Elements of the Ikhwan also raided Kuwait in January 1928. On both occasions, they looted camels and sheep. Though they raided brutally, they suffered heavy retaliation from the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and Kuwaitis.Peter W. Wilson, Douglas Graham. Saudi Arabia: the coming storm . M.E.Sharpe, 1994: p.45 In order to settle the issue a meeting, Al Jam'iyah Al 'Umumiyah (the General Assembly or the Al Riyadh Conference), was held by Ibn Saud in Riyadh in November 1928. The participants were 800 individuals including several tribe and clan leaders who were part of Ikhwan and significant members of religious body or ulema. In January 1929, an Ikhwan raid on the Sheikhdom of Kuwait resulted in the killing of an American missionary, Dr. Bilkert, who was traveling by car with another American, the philanthropist Charles Crane.Leatherdale, Clive. Britain and Saudi Arabia, 1925-1939: the Imperial Oasis. p.115. With no signs of Ibn Saud mobilizing his forces to rein in the Ikhwan and stop the raids, RAF resources were extended to Kuwait. Open revolt 280px Ibn Saud, however, refused to agree to the wild Ikhwani raids. Although the Ikhwan had been taught that all non-Wahabbis were infidels, Abdul-Aziz was well aware that the few parts of central Arabia not part of his realm had treaties with London. He himself had just won British recognition as an independent ruler only a year earlier and recognized the danger of a direct conflict with the British. The Ikhwan therefore openly revolted in December 1928. =Battle of Sabilla= The largest confrontation of the parties occurred in 1929, known as Battle of Sabilla, where the Ikhwan leadership were killed.'Arabian Sands' by Wilfred Thesiger, 1991, pp. 248-249 The battle started in the early hours on 31 March 1929. It lasted only for one hour due to evident superiority of forces of Ibn Saud. The Battle of Sabilla was the last major battle of camel raiders, thus having historic importance. It had become a scene of carnage for the technologically mediocre Ikhwan against the cavalry and machine-guns of Ibn Saud's army. In the aftermath of the battle some 500 Ikhwan tribesmen died, whereas Ibn Saud's losses were about 200. =Battle of Jabal Shammar= Ikhwan-affiliated tribesmen and loyal Saudi troops clashed again in the Jabal Shammar region in August 1929, resulting in the deaths of some 1,000 men. =Attack on Awazim tribe= Despite their losses, the remnant of the Ikhwan tribesmen went on with their rebellion by attacking the Awazim tribe in Arabia on 5 October 1929, resulting in the deaths of some 250 individuals. =Final accords= Faisal Al-Dawish fled to Kuwait in October 1929, and government troops finally suppressed the rebellion on 10 January 1930, when Ikhwan rebel leaders surrendered to the British. Aftermath In the aftermath, the Ikhwan leadership was slain, and the remains were eventually incorporated into regular Saudi units. Sultan bin Bajad, one of the main Ikhwan leaders, was killed in 1931, whereas Faisal al-Dawish died in prison in Riyadh on 3 October 1931.

This theory was first posited by Zillmann and Cantor (1977), and many offshoots have followed in various areas of entertainment (Raney, 2006a). Entertainment users make constant judgments of a character's actions, and these judgments enable the user to determine which character they believe is the \\"good guy\\" or the \\"villain\\". However, in an article written in 2004, Raney examined the fundamental ADT assumption that viewers of drama always form their dispositions toward characters through moral judgment of motives and conduct. Raney argued that viewers/consumers of entertainment media could form positive dispositions toward characters before any moral scrutinizing occurs. He proposed that viewers sometimes develop story schemas that provide them \\"with the cognitive pegs upon which to hang their initial interpretations and expectations of characters\\" (Raney, 2004, p. 354). The basic idea of the affective disposition theory is used as a way to explain how emotions become part of the entertainment experience.  Theory history and application  Disposition theory has multiple applications in many areas of entertainment. Its most basic premise is that entertainment users attach an emotion to various characters within a narrative, but this has been expanded to comedy, drama, tragedy, violence, and sport (Raney, 2006a). Although some theorist argue that the similar theories used to explore different forms of entertainment media encompass the same general processes, some evidence exists that disposition formation may differ across content. Sapolsky's research (1980) found that viewer race rather than the previously mentioned \\"morality\\" was an accurate predictor in team favorability in an all-White versus all- Black basketball game. With regard to antihero narratives, researchers such as Sapolsky have suggested that the actual formation process of dispositions may differ from the traditional affective disposition theory formula. The traditional Disposition Theory is closely related to misattribution theory of humor. Disposition Theory takes the position that entertainment users are just an audience, they are not active. By employing this perspective, the audience does not experience real emotion towards the events in the narrative, but rather experience suspense instead. Traditional Disposition Theory is most often applied in the context of humor, but is also applicable to drama and sports. Raney (2006a) offered six principles that are shared amongst all applications of disposition theory: #\\"Disposition-based theories are concerned with the enjoyment or appreciation of media content.\\" (pg. 144) #\\"Disposition- based theories are concerned with emotional responses to media content.\\" (pg. 145) #\\"Disposition-based theories contend that media enjoyment starts with and is driven by the viewer's feelings about the character.\\" (pg. 145) #\\"Disposition-based theories contend that affiliations towards characters are formed and maintained on a continuum from extreme positive through indifference to extreme negative affect.\\" (pg. 146) #\\"Because disposition- based theories rely upon the evaluation of conflict outcomes between characters, justice consideration are a necessary component of the theories.\\" (pg. 147) #\\"Disposition-based theories further acknowledge and rely upon the differences between individuals in terms of emotional responsiveness, personal experiences, basal morality, and countless other psychological and social- psychological factors.\\" (pg. 147) As stated earlier, disposition theories can be applied in many contexts, but most share similar characteristics, as identified by Raney (2006). In summation, these six principles are strongly centered around the ideas of enjoyment of entertainment and emotional responses. These theories can be used to formulate narratives and create drama and emotional arousal during a story. Using these six principles, one can surmise that creating a strong and opposing disposition for the characters in the story will lead to greater enjoyment for the viewer. By making a villain's actions terribly amoral, and the hero's actions extremely moral, one can create emotional arousal in a viewer.  Model of forming dispositions  Zillmann (1996) offered a model of disposition formation. The model begins with a character's behavior and ends with approval of the story. There are seven main steps in disposition formation: #Perception and Assessment – In this step, the viewer simply observes the act of the character. # Moral Judgment – The viewer judges the action of the character as either appropriate and moral or inappropriate and amoral. Here, the model splits paths. If the viewer believes the act to be amoral, disposition formation takes a strikingly different route than if the viewer believes the act to be moral and appropriate. From here, the moral route will be referred to as moral and the amoral route will be referred to as amoral. #Affective Disposition – Here, if the viewer decides the character is following the moral route, they begin to form positive affect toward that character. The opposite is true if the viewer decides the character is following the amoral route. #Anticipation and Apprehension – Here, the viewer hopes for a positive outcome and fears a negative outcome for the moral character while fearing a positive outcome and hoping for a negative outcome for the amoral character. #Perception and Assessment – The outcome is viewed and an emotion is attached. #Response to Outcome/Emotion – The viewer decides how they feel about the story and characters. #Moral Judgment – The viewer decides if they approve of the outcome of the story or disapprove of it. This model further illuminates the disposition process. As stated earlier, if a story incites a strong disposition toward any character, viewer enjoyment is likely to be higher due to the emotional arousal created by the narrative. Through this model, one can pinpoint where and how a disposition is created. This model also displays the steps the viewer goes through to create a disposition.  Application  The creator of any narrative can use Disposition Theory to heighten emotional arousal, and therefore enjoyment, in any narrative. By applying the steps of the disposition model a writer can heighten the experience of a narrative. Creating a strong disposition towards the characters will lead the viewer to hope for a positive outcome for the hero and a negative outcome for the villain, all the while fearing a negative outcome for the hero and fearing a positive outcome for the villain. By delaying this outcome, the writer can create suspense in the viewer. By creating suspense, the writer can heighten emotional arousal and, therefore, heighten enjoyment of the narrative. In summation, by creating a strong disposition towards characters, a writer can heighten the audience's enjoyment of the narrative.  Applied to sports spectatorship  The concepts of the traditional affective disposition theory have been applied to sports media consumption by considering the fact that enjoyment could be conceived as the emotional response to consuming media surrounding players or teams. The exploration of enjoyment of sport spectatorship is very complex and must take into account fan socialization and disposition formation. Research on fan socialization investigates how people are originally socialized as sports fans, and also examines the reasons why people form allegiances towards specific teams. Raney (2006b) states that these allegiances and types of socializations are at the core of the entertainment motivation for viewing sports media. The specific version of the disposition theory that is used in sport media viewing (Disposition Theory of Sport Spectatorship) applies the basic ideas of the disposition theory to sports content. The basic premise that is used to cross over into the world of sport is that enjoyment of entertainment is primarily a reflection of both the consumers' feelings toward the players or teams and the outcomes (Zillmann, 1991, 2000; Zillmann & Cantor, 1977; Raney, 2004a, 2004b; Raney, 2006b; Peterson & Raney, 2008). Raney (2006b) also found that the expectation of experiencing enjoyment is the greatest reason that sports media viewers report for why they consume sports media. According to academic researchers and theorist (Bryant & Raney, 2000; Zillman, Bryant & Sapolsky, 1989; Zillman & Paulus, 1993), the Disposition Theory of Sports Spectatorship states that a viewer’s affiliation or allegiance to a particular team or player must be discussed along a continuum. This continuum ranges from extremely positive through indifference to extremely negative. Raney (2006b) posits that the enjoyment of viewing a sporting event comes as a by-product of a combination of the outcome of the game, and the viewers strength and valence of dispositions held toward the competitors. Exposure to the competitors over time allows individuals to develop these dispositions of varying valence and degree toward teams and athletes. In more simplistic terms, the enjoyment of the spectator or viewer has been found to increase the more the winning team is favored by the spectator/viewer and the more the losing team is disliked by the spectator/viewer. Henceforth, the maximum enjoyment of the spectator comes when the intensely liked team or player defeats the intensely disliked team or player. Additionally, research indicates that sports fanship in general is important to enjoyment of sports media. Specifically, Gantz & Wenner (1991, 1995) found that the selective exposure to media and motivations for viewing sports media literatures indicate that fanship in relation to the particular sport also impacts perceptions about the contest. Therefore, the argument can be made that this level of dispositional affiliation toward the sport might also impact perceived suspense and enjoyment. Raney and Depalma (2006) also noted that the nature of the sport being view, either scripted or unscripted, cause viewers to approach the sporting event with differing expectations of enjoyment. The uncertainty of outcomes for contests that are unscripted when combined with multiple other factors such as rivalry strength and importance of the game to the overall ranking of the team affect the suspense and enjoyment of viewing.

It is the fourth single from their second full-length album, American Tragedy, and the third track on that album. It is the band's tenth overall single in their discography. An alternate version of track was released as a promotional single in January and was released as a single on April 9, 2011, just after the release of the band's second album. A music video was also released the same day. A remix was featured on the band's American Tragedy Redux remix album.  Background  An alternate version of the track was initially released for free on the band's Facebook as a promotional single for their second album, American Tragedy. In the alternate track, Charlie Scene and Funny Man have a different 2nd verse, and some of the instruments and synthesizers are louder than on the album-version of the song. On April 5, the band released the American Tragedy album. Four days later, on April 9, the song was released as the third official single following \\"Been to Hell\\" and \\"Coming Back Down\\". A music video was also released the same day. A remix of the song by Wideboys was included on the 2011 remix album American Tragedy Redux. Music video The official music video, co-directed by Kai Henry and Robert Corbi, was released on April 9, 2011. Sylvie Lesas of Evigshed noted that the previous music videos for the album, \\"Hear Me Now\\" and \\"Been to Hell\\", were dark and very serious, making the comical video for \\"Comin' in Hot\\" a change in tone. The video begins with western style opening credits then follows nearly two minutes of conversation prior to the music beginning. In a change for the band, a large portion of the video has the band performing without their masks. During the non-music portion, the video shows Funny Man, Charlie Scene, and J-Dog working the fields dressed as field workers and all adorning Mexican accents. They discuss poor working conditions and the need for a break before noticing that the field owner, played by Johnny 3 Tears, has three beautiful daughters dressed similarly to Daisy Duke. The three men covet the girls and the owner notices, warning them to get back to work before the music begins. During the song, the lyrics are performed while the band is shown, still dressed in country attire, as working the field and roaming the farm for girls. The band is not shown in their normal masks and attire until the second verse. The band is shown to be performing on the same farm as the acted portion of the video. The band performs on plain ground with just bales of hay around them, with the camera rotating from a ground shot to an aerial shot at times. The chorus is sung by Danny, while the pre-chorus is sung by Charlie Scene. Charlie Scene raps the first verse while the second verse is rapped back and forth by Funny Man and Charlie Scene. Reception The track was reviewed by Evigshed writer sylgraph on January 22, 2011. The writer called the track extremely convincing of the band's skill and fame.

When asked why she was compelled to join the Army, Galloway replied that she was inspired to join because of her brother who was serving in the Pacific during World War II and because of an article in the New York Times regarding opportunities for women in the Army.\\"Longines Chronoscope Television Journal\\" 1956 v.6 Interview of Irene O. Galloway by Larry LeSueur and Don Hollenbeck, https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.95897 Galloway served in the WAAC through World War II and witnessed many changes in the roles women played in the military throughout the Cold War, one of which was the loss of women's status as \\"auxiliary\\" units that changed the name of the WAAC to WAC. Upon completing her training, Galloway served at the WAC headquarters at the Pentagon, the headquarters for the Army Services Forces, and with the G-1 Career Management Group until she was assigned as WAAC Staff Advisor for the U.S. Army in Europe in 1948. In November 1952 Galloway was selected as a replacement for commander of the WAC Training Center in Fort Lee. Just two weeks after reporting for duty as Commander of the WAC Training Center, Galloway was notified of her selection as Director of the WAC and was sworn in on January 3, 1953. At the time of her appointment as director, Colonel Galloway had served 10 years in the WAC, and was awarded the Commendation Ribbon from the Army of Occupation WAAC, and the American Theater and European Theater Ribbons during World War II.

The 7th position is occupied by a name containing “Ḫarba.”Variously restored as Ḫarba-Šipak, and Ḫurbazum. It has been suggested that the 9th position may show traces of the name “Kakrime”, purported to mean Sword of Mercy or Weapon of Thunder. Agum-Kakrime Inscription Everything that is known about him is through the Agum-Kakrime Inscription, an Akkadian text written in the neo-Assyrian cuneiform script but in very short lines in imitation of an antiquarian style. It is extant in two copies,Tablets K. (for Kouyunjik collection) 4149, 4203, 4348 and Sm. (for Smith collection) 27 in the British Museum.Tablet Rm 505 in the Rassam siglum of tablets in the British Museum. which describe the King's recovery of the cultic Statue of Marduk from the land of Ḫana (KUR ḫa-ni-i), pilfered by the Hittites during their sack of Babylon, and its restoration in the newly refurbished temple of Ésagila. In it, Agum portrays himself as the legitimate ruler and caring “shepherd” of both the Kassites and the Akkadians. He asserts his suzerainty over Padan and Alman and also the Guteans, “a foolish people,”UN.MEŠ saklāti; some translations say “a barbarous people” (saklu, CAD S p. 80). groups variously located in regions of the Zagros mountains. The inscription begins with an introduction, giving the King's name, genealogy, epithets and so on. He is a descendant of Abi[rattash], “the fierce hero.” It continues with a long narrative of the return of Marduk and his consort Zarpanītum and then lists Agum-Kakrime's many generous donations to the temple and includes descriptions of the purification of the house itself by a snake charmer and the construction of protective demons for the doorway. Of uncertain provenance, it is on two tablets, one of which covers 8 columns and more than 350 lines, and including much esoteric detail concerning the temple and its rituals. One was found in the library of Ashurbanipal, purporting to be a copy of an inscription made in antiquity while the other was found elsewhere in Kouyunjik, ancient Nineveh. The Library of Ashurbanipal copy contains two colophons, and apart from the standard library identification, the earlier one reads mudû mudâ likallim, which has been translated as “Let the learned instruct the learned” or alternatively “The initiate may show the initiate.” For those disputing its authenticity, it is a later pseudonymous propaganda piece for the cult of Marduk, emphasizing certain tax exemptions granted for the restoration of the statues. Kassite era royal inscriptions are usually inscribed in Sumerian. Those supportive of its authenticity cite the iconography of the demons described on the door of the cella, which represent Marduk's defeated foes,“Venomous Snake” (Bašmu), “hairy one” (Laḫmu), “Bull- Man” (Kusarikku), “Big-Weather Beast” (Ugallu), “Mad Lion” (Uridimmu), “Fish- Man” (Kulullû) and “Carp-Goat” (suhurmašu) the gods of cities conquered by Babylon, such as Ešnunna and are illustrative of a middle Babylonian theology.

A total of 35 seats were up for election, all councillors from all wards. The previous election produced a majority for the Conservative Party. Election result These elections saw Labour narrowly win with a majority of just one seat and narrowly win the popular vote in the borough by just 676 votes. The number of close results in so many wards perhaps is the reason for this. The Conservatives lost four seats at these elections, in the following wards. * Arley and Whitacre, where Labour gained the second seat, and also came 18 votes short of winning the third seat. * Atherstone Central, where Labour retained the seat they won at the last council elections in 2007 and additionally retained their March 2009 by-election gain of the one Conservative seat in the ward. * Coleshill North, where Labour gained the first seat, while coming 17 votes short of winning the other seat. This was the first time Labour won a seat in this ward since 1995. * Polesworth West, where Labour gained the Conservative seat, while retaining the seat Labour held in 2003 and 2007.

According to Egyptologist Kim Ryholt he was the thirty-first pharaoh of the dynasty, while Darrell Baker believes instead that he was its thirtieth ruler.K. S. B. Ryholt, The political situation in Egypt during the second intermediate period, c. 1800–1550 B.C. Museum Tusculanum Press, 1997, pp 37, 233Darrell D. Baker: The Encyclopedia of the Pharaohs: Volume I - Predynastic to the Twentieth Dynasty 3300–1069 BC, Stacey International, , 2008 Alternatively, Jürgen von Beckerath and Detlef Franke see him as the twenty-fifth king of the dynasty.Jürgen von Beckerath: Untersuchungen zur politischen Geschichte der Zweiten Zwischenzeit in Ägypten, Glückstadt, 1964Jürgen von Beckerath: Chronologie des pharaonischen Ägyptens, Münchner Ägyptologische Studien 46, Mainz am Rhein, 1997Thomas Schneider: Ancient Egyptian Chronology - Edited by Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss, And David a. Warburton, available online, see p. 176  Identity Until Ryholt's study of the Second Intermediate Period, it was believed that Sobekhotep VI's prenomen was Merhotepre. Reevaluating the archeological evidence, however, Ryholt attributed Merhotepre to Sobekhotep V and Khahotepre to Sobekhotep VI. Because of this change of prenomen, Merhotepre Sobekhotep and Khahotepre Sobekhotep are respectively called Sobekhotep VI and Sobekhotep V in older studies. Attestations Khahotepre Sobekhotep VI is listed in the Turin canon as the successor of Sobekhotep IV. However, this only occurs because one line is missing within a lacuna in the king list, below the line for Sobekhotep IV. This lacuna would have preserved the reign of Merhotepre Sobekhotep.Ryholt, pp.22-23 Khahotepre Sobekhotep VI is credited a reign of 4 years, 8 months and 29 days,Thomas Schneider: Lexikon der Pharaonen, p. 257 which Ryholt dates to 1719-1715 BC. In spite of this relatively long reign for the period, there are only very few objects directly attesting Sobekhotep VI. There exists a scarab seal from AbydosScarab of Khahotepre Sobekhotep, Metropolitan Museum of Art and a kneeling statuette of the king, possibly from Kerma. Items of unknown provenance include 6 scarab seals, a cylinder sealCylinder seal of SObekhotep VI, Petrie Museum and a seal impression. Finally, a scarab bearing the prenomen Khahotepre was found in a tomb in Jericho, which could be evidence of trade relations between the 13th dynasty state and the Levant. Family Khahotepre Sobekhotep VI's father was perhaps Sobekhotep IV, the best attested king of the entire second intermediate period. This hypothesis is based on an inscription found in the Wadi el-Hudi which attests that Sobekhotep IV had a son called 'Sobekhotep'. If this son is indeed Sobekhotep VI, then his mother would be possibly Tjan, wife of Sobekhotep IV. Sobekhotep VI's queen may have been named Khaenoub (also Khaesnebou) or Nubhotepti.

Engel wore uniform number 5 for most of his career. A former president of the umpires union, Engel retired after being arrested for the theft of more than 4,000 baseball cards from a Target store in California, for which he pleaded no contest. Early life As a young man in Bakersfield, California, Engel worked as a hotel bellhop. Baseball umpires who stayed at the hotel caught his attention; he noticed that they stayed out late at night and did not have to wake up until the early afternoon. After serving in the military, Engel worked for an oil tool company. After seeing ads in The Sporting News for the George Barr Umpire School, Engel decided to attend. He was hired into professional baseball and worked ten years in the minor leagues before receiving his promotion to the major leagues. Career Engel was an umpire in the 1972, 1979, and 1985 World Series. He worked four Major League Baseball All-Star Games, and six National League Championship Series. In his career, Engel umpired 3,630 major-league games.Retrosheet Interviewed for a 1987 piece in Sports Illustrated, Engel expressed annoyance at fellow umpires with a flair for the dramatic, saying that \\"the players don't care how much gyration you put on. All they care about is getting them right. And I'll guarantee you, the players always want to know who's umpiring, because no two umpires have the same strike zone.\\" He was the president of the Major League Umpires Association, the union for major-league umpires, at the time of the 1978 umpire strike. Engel retired in 1990 after he pleaded no contest to charges of stealing more than 4,000 1990 Score baseball cards from a Target store in Bakersfield and attempting to steal cards from a second store.

Gough grew up near Heathrow Airport in London before moving to Nenagh aged seven. He was studying English and philosophy at University College Galway in the late 1980s when he and some friends founded Toasted Heretic. The band went on to record four albums and had one top ten hit, \\"Galway and Los Angeles\\", in 1992. His first novel, Juno & Juliet, was published in 2001 by Flamingo, almost a decade after Toasted Heretic split up. His second novel, Jude: Level 1, was published in 2007 at Old Street Publishing, shortly after he won the 2007 National Short Story Award for the book's first chapter, titled \\"The Orphan and the Mob\\". In 2010, Salmon Poetry released Gough's first poetry collection, Free Sex Chocolate, which juxtaposes Gough's more recent forays into poetry with his earlier lyrics written for Toasted Heretic. He is also the author of several short stories and novellas that satirize global economic policies, including 2003's Great Hargeisa Goat Bubble and CRASH! How I Lost a Hundred Billion and Found True Love. In 2015, Gough signed a book deal with Picador. Gough also writes columns and opinion pieces for various newspapers and magazines, including Guardian, Prospect Magazine and A Public Space. In 2007, he rebelled against the decision to award the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize to writer Will Self. Gough, who was nominated alongside Self, stole the prize, a pig, to keep for himself. In early 2010, Gough wrote an article on the state of Irish literature, \\"slamming fellow Irish novelists\\", on his personal website. Gough's novel Jude in London came third in the 2011 Guardian Not The Booker prize after the author threatened to share pictures of him \\"wearing only the [Not The Booker trophy] mug\\" shall he win the competition. In 2011, he wrote a short dialogue (known as the \\"End Poem\\") for the ending credits for the popular video game Minecraft prior to its November release. In 2018, Julian published CONNECT, a novel that had been in development since 2012. With the writing of this epic novel spanning six years, it was also written all over the world including the cities of Edinburgh, Berlin, Las Vegas, Dublin, Limerick, and Singapore.

Amazon launched Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP), originally called Digital Text Platform, to be used by authors and publishers, to independently publish their books directly to the Kindle Store. Authors can upload documents in several formats for delivery via Whispernet and charge between $0.99 and $200.00 for their works. These documents may be written in 34 languages. In 2016, Amazon also added a paperback option, which uses print-on-demand technology with the goal of offering digital and print to self-publishers. Amazon has been promoting to its authors the capability of publishing both e-books and paperbacks through the same platform.  History  Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) was in open beta testing in late 2007 and the platform was promoted to established authors by e-mail and by advertisements at Amazon.com. In a December 5, 2009 interview with The New York Times, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos revealed that Amazon keeps 65% of the revenue from all e-book sales for the Kindle. The remaining 35% is split between the author and publisher. After numerous commentators observed that Apple's popular App Store offers 70% of royalties to the publisher, Amazon began a program that offers 70% royalties to Kindle publishers who agree to certain conditions. Amazon has the KDP Select publishing option that requires 100 percent exclusivity — e-book publishing under this option cannot be sold anywhere else. While under KDP Select, an author can offer the book free for five days or discount it for up to seven days through a countdown deal, while still earning 70% royalties. The author can opt out from KDP select ninety days after enrollment. If no action is taken, it will auto-renew the book for another ninety days. Outside of limited deals, e-books permanently priced below $2.99 only get 35% royalties.Alexis Grant, April 14, 2014 Kindle Publishing: A Step-by-Step Guide for Selling Your Book Through Amazon Retrieved 11 April 2016. All KDP Select books are included in Kindle Unlimited, which is a monthly subscription that allows unlimited reading of e-books. Amazon has reported the Kindle version of Fifty Shades of Grey sold more than double that of Amazon's print sales of the book, and, in June 2012, the Kindle edition became the first ebook to sell more than one million copies on Amazon. Amazon initially paid authors in its KDP Select program a set fee per book, provided a reader to read at least 10 percent of the book. This drew criticism from authors of longer works because a reader would have to read more of their books in order for the authors to receive any payment, while those who wrote shorter books could receive the fees more easily. In July 2015, the company changed its Kindle Select payment structure to a per-page model. Every time an author's e-book is borrowed and pages are read, the author earns a share of a monthly fund, which was $1.2 million in April 2014, $11 million in July 2015, KDP Select’s New Royalty is Estimated to be Around Half a Cent Per Page The Digital Reader July 1, 2015 and currently $28.5 million, for a per-page rate of about half a cent. During 2016, Amazon released four million e-books and 40% of those titles were self- published under KDP.The Kindle Effect Fortune Magazine, December 30, 2016. In April 2017, Amazon released Kindle Create, an application for converting Word and PDF files into Kindle-compatible files; before this release there were multiple Amazon apps to convert various types of files.Kindle Create Lets You Make a Kindle eBook From a Word File Retrieved April 6, 2017. Total royalties paid out to self-publishers on Amazon KDP were over $260 million in 2018, increasing to over $300 million in 2019.  Kindle Scout  In 2014, Amazon released the Kindle Scout platform that allows readers to nominate e-books to be published by Kindle Press; as of November 2016, 197 books have been published through this program. Readers nominate works they would like to see published by looking through categories, such as romance, fantasy, science fiction or mystery and picking an excerpt of a work to read. The reader is able to read up to 5,000 words of any e-book listed, and can nominate up to three e-books at any time. Nominations can be changed at will. After the book's 30-day campaign ends, Kindle Press editors decide within fifteen days whether to give it a contract. Readers who nominated the book on the final day of its campaign are given a free copy of the e-book when it is published. Submitted manuscripts must be non-published works of 50,000 or more words. Genres accepted are science fiction, fantasy, mystery, and romance. Once a book has been accepted for a campaign on Kindle Scout, a page for the book is created and the author's 30-day campaign begins. The author submits their work with the title, cover, tag and blurb, plus the entire text of the book. Throughout the 30-day campaign, the author can promote their novel to attract nominations, and books with the most nominations feature in the Hot & Trending chart - although books with many views and hours in the Hot & Trending chart have been rejected, and books with few of either have been selected. If the book is chosen the author is paid a $1,500 advance and 50% royalties. When the book has earned out, Amazon pays royalties monthly. Chosen books are given a professional edit, with the author free to accept or reject changes. Amazon takes all rights except print rights. If the e-book does not make $25,000 in the first five years, the author can request the rights back. Amazon actively promotes Kindle Press e-books. In April 2018, Amazon stopped taking new submissions to Kindle Scout, indicating that the service would be shut down in the near future.Amazon is Shutting Down Its Crowd-Sourcing Platform, Kindle Scout Retrieved April 2, 2018. At that time, 293 titles had been selected for publication during the program. Kindle Publishing for Blogs Blogs published by popular media, such as Ars Technica and TechCrunch, have been available on Kindle since early 2008. In May 2009, the program was opened to all. In December 2015, the status for Kindle Publishing for Blogs was listed as beta. Amazon, not the content publisher, set the monthly subscription rate for each blog between $0.99 - $1.99. Amazon retained 70% of the revenue from blog sales and gave the remaining 30% to be shared between the publisher and author. Amazon announced via email that it was discontinuing support for blogs on Kindle due to low usage as of August 19, 2019, and has renamed the service Kindle Publishing for Periodicals. Criticism The revenue sharing condition and the inability to opt out of the lendability feature, that was abused in the former Lendink service, have caused some controversy. Other criticisms involve the business model behind Amazon's implementation and distribution of e-books. Amazon introduced a software application allowing Kindle books to be read on an iPhone or iPod Touch, and soon followed with an application called \\"Kindle for PCs\\" that can be run on a Windows PC. Due to the book publishers' DRM policies, Amazon claims there is no right of first sale with e-books and states that, since e-books are licensed, not purchased (unlike paper books), buyers do not actually own their e-books. This claim has never been tested in court, and the outcome of any action by Amazon is uncertain. The law on these matters is in a state of flux in jurisdictions around the world.

Although recovery took hold, the unemployment rate remained unchanged through the start of a second recession in July 1981. The downturn ended 16 months later, in November 1982. The economy entered a strong recovery and experienced a lengthy expansion through 1990. Principal causes of the 1980 recession included contractionary monetary policy undertaken by the Federal Reserve to combat double digit inflation and residual effects of the energy crisis. Manufacturing and construction failed to recover before more aggressive inflation reducing policy was adopted by the Federal Reserve in 1981, causing a second downturn. Due to their proximity and compounded effects, they are commonly referred to as the early 1980s recession, an example of a W-shaped or \\"double dip\\" recession; it remains the most recent example of such a recession in the United States. The recession marked a shift in policy from more traditional Keynesian economics to the adoption of neoliberal economic policies. This change was primarily achieved through tax reform and stronger monetary policy on the part of the Federal Reserve, with the strong recovery and long, stable period of growth that followed increasing the popularity of both concepts in political and academic circles. Background Beginning in 1978, inflation began to intensify, reaching double-digit levels in 1979. The consumer price index rose considerably between 1978 and 1980. These increases were largely attributed to the oil price shocks of 1979 and 1980, although the core consumer price index which excludes energy and food also posted large increases. Productivity, real gross national product, and personal income remained essentially unchanged during this period, while inflation continued to rise, a phenomenon known as stagflation. In order to combat rising inflation, recently appointed chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker, elected to increase the federal funds rate. Following the October 6, 1979 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the federal funds rate increased gradually from 11.5% to an eventual peak of 17.6% in April 1980. This caused an economic recession beginning in January 1980, and in March 1980, president Jimmy Carter created his own plan for credit controls and budget cuts to beat inflation. In order to cooperate with these new priorities, the federal funds rate was lowered considerably from its April peak. 1980 A recession occurred beginning in January 1980. As a result of the increasing federal funds rate, credit became more difficult to obtain for car and home loans. This caused severe contractions in manufacturing and housing, which were dependent on the availability of consumer credit. Most of the jobs lost during the recession centered around goods producing industries, while the service sector remained largely intact. Over the course of the recession, manufacturing shed 1.1 million jobs, with the recession posting a total loss of 1.3 million jobs, representing 1.2% of payrolls. The automotive industry, already in a poor position due to weak sales in 1979, shed 310,000 jobs, representing 33% of that sector. Construction declined by a similar 300,000. Unemployment rose to a recession peak of 7.8% in June 1980, however, it changed very little through the end of the year, averaging 7.5% through the first quarter of 1981. The official end of the recession was established as of July 1980. As interest rates dropped beginning in May, payrolls turned positive. Unemployment among auto workers rose from a low of 4.8% in 1979 to a record high of 24.7%, then fell to 17.4% by the end of the year. Construction unemployment rose to 16.3%, and also moderated near the end of the year. During the final quarter of 1980, there were doubts that the economy was in recovery, and instead was experiencing a temporary respite. These concerns were fueled by poor performance in housing and auto sales in the final months of 1980, as well as a second wave of rising interest rates and stagnant unemployment rate. 1981–1982 U.S. President Ronald Reagan gives a televised address from the Oval Office outlining his plan for tax reductions in July 1981. As 1981 began, the Federal Reserve reported that there would be little or no economic growth in 1981, as interest rates were to continue rising in an attempt to reduce inflation. After failing to gain traction during the weak and brief recovery from the 1980 downturn, weakness in manufacturing and housing caused by rising interest rates began to have an expanded effect on related sectors beginning in mid-1981. Job losses resumed, this time expanding to nearly all employment sectors through the end of 1982. Goods-producing sectors were hardest hit: 90% of all job losses in 1982 came from manufacturing, despite this sector making up only 30% of total non-farm employment. The machinery industry shed 400,000 jobs. Transportation equipment manufacturing fell by 180,000 jobs. Layoffs in electrical and electronics manufacturing exceeded 100,000. The mining sector shed 150,000 jobs, likely a result of high commodity prices and cratering demand from the recession. Construction shed a total of 385,000 jobs from July 1981 through December 1982. Non-durable goods manufacturing (e.g. textiles, rubber, apparel, plastics, tobacco, food, etc.), already under pressure since the mid-1970s, suffered some 365,000 job cuts. The unemployment rate for auto workers rose from just 3.8% in early-1978 to 24% by the end of 1982; construction worker unemployment peaked at 22% during the same time. The services sector, while not hit nearly as hard as manufacturing, shed 400,000 jobs during the recession, with sharp declines in transportation, utilities, state & local governments, and wholesale and retail trade. However, the finance, insurance, and real estate sector gained 35,000 jobs over the duration of the recession. The heavy losses in manufacturing and construction, contrasted with more minor losses in services, also affected the unemployment rates for men and women differently. While the increases in unemployment for both sexes were roughly equal during the recession of 1973-1975 recession, the unemployment rate for men increased 4.5 percentage points during the 1981-1982 recession, while women suffered a comparatively more mild 2.5 percentage point increase in joblessness. Between the fall of 1981 and the end of 1982, nearly 70% of the increase in unemployment came from men's unemployment. Unemployment had changed very little in the period between the end of the 1980 recession and the July 1981 start of the second, never dropping below 7.2%. Unemployment rose to double digits for the first time since 1941 in September 1982, and stood at a postwar high of 10.8% by the end of the year. The total increase in unemployment was 3.6%, which was less than the 1973–75 recession increase of 3.8%, yet still higher than the 2.9% average. Because the recession began with already elevated levels of unemployment, the increase easily pushed it higher than any other post-war recession. Overall, the recession caused the loss of 2.9 million jobs, representing a 3.0% drop in payroll employment, the largest percentage decline since the 1957–1958 recession. The number of underemployed workers (those who are working part-time but want full-time work) rose to the highest number ever recorded at that time since data collection began in 1955. Unemployment was particularly severe amongst teenagers and racial minorities: the unemployment rates for black Americans peaked at 20% in December 1982, compared to 15% for Latinos and 9.3% for white Americans. Teen unemployment hit 24%, and was particularly severe amongst black teenagers: for most of 1982, unemployment for black teenagers stayed at roughly 50%. Ronald Reagan, who had assumed office in January 1981, brought his own economic plan to the table. In August 1981, the president signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, a three-year tax cut plan. As the recession deepened in 1982, Reagan's approval rating also dropped. As a result, during the 1982 midterm elections, Republican gains made in the House of Representatives during the 1980 election were reversed. However, control of the Senate was retained by the Republicans. Recovery In July 1983, the official end of the recession was announced as November 1982, with the employment trough occurring in December. At the time of the announcement, output and sales had already met or exceeded levels achieved before the recession began. Through December 1983, nonfarm payrolls rose by 2.9 million and the unemployment rate fell by 2.5%. The auto industry had posted losses of $187 million in the third quarter of 1982, which turned into a gain of $1.2 billion during the same period in 1983. To prevent a new surge of inflation, interest and mortgage rates remained abnormally high throughout 1983, delaying a recovery in construction and housing. A comparative analysis of the first six quarters of post-war economic recoveries published in the August 1984 issue of the Monthly Labor Review indicated the 1983–1984 recovery was stronger than any post-war recovery since that of the 1953 recession. As the third year of recovery drew to a close in 1985, payroll employment had grown by 10 million since the end of the recession. Growth continued through July 1990, creating what was at the time the longest peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history. Impact Although the economy recovered in 1983, the residual effects of high inflation and high interest rates had a profound impact on the savings and loans industry. Savings and loan associations were limited by interest rate ceilings. As a result of rising interest rates, many savings and loan institutions experienced frequent account withdrawals, as depositors moved their money to higher-earning accounts offered by commercial banks. The already struggling savings and loans industry posted large losses in 1981 and 1982. High mortgage rates eroded the value of mortgage-backed loans, the primary asset of savings and loan associations. These fixed-rate loans were sold at a loss in order to balance withdrawals. This asset liability mismatch was identified as the primary cause of the savings and loan crisis. Long-term effects Although the U.S. macroeconomy recovered during the 1983-1990 economic expansion period, the early-1980s recession cast a long shadow over many parts of the United States, especially those reliant on heavy industry. For example, heavily industrialized Lake County, Indiana (home to major manufacturing cities such as Gary, East Chicago, and Hammond), did not recover its 1980 employment level until 1996. And as of 2010, the county's inflation-adjusted output has stubbornly remained 15-20% below its 1978 peak. Other steel-producing regions, such as the south side of Chicago, the Mahoning Valley, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh, had been struggling since the onset of the 1973-75 recession, but it was the early-1980s recession that left deep and lasting damage to local economies. Mining communities in Minnesota's Iron Range, Wisconsin's Driftless Area, eastern Kentucky, and West Virginia were also devastated after years of struggle. Although inflation subsided and interest rates began to decline starting in 1983, the Federal Reserve was still committed to a strong- dollar policy through the mid-1980s. This prevented a recovery in manufacturing by undermining the competitiveness of exports of American manufactured goods (particularly automobiles and steel). It was not until 1985 that the Reagan administration and the Federal Reserve took action to correct this when the U.S. signed the Plaza Accord with France, West Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. As the U.S. Dollar depreciated some 50% against these major currencies, this agreement (combined with voluntary export restrictions) did help American exports recover, particularly in the automotive sector: by the early-1990s, the number of vehicles assembled by Japanese automakers in U.S. plants exceeded the number of auto exports from Japan to the U.S., a trend that still continues into the 2010s. However, many of the auto manufacturing plants were set up in states with right-to-work laws, primarily in the South and West. The Rust Belt states, particularly the auto-making states of Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana, did not always reap the full benefits of this change. U.S. manufacturing employment peaked at 17.9 million in June 1979, before sharply declining by 2.8 million before bottoming out in January 1983. Although 1.2 million manufacturing jobs would be created during the 1983-1990 period, the 1979 peak would never be reached again.

It was founded in 1745 by the Moravian Church and lays claim to being the oldest continuously operating bookstore in the United States and the second oldest in the world. (The Livraria Bertrand in Lisbon, Portugal, which has been open since 1732, is the oldest bookstore in the world.) The Moravian Book Shop, as of June 2018, is also home to the Moravian College student bookstore. In 2018, the Moravian Church Northern Province approached Moravian College seeking to sell the store to entrust the legacy of the Book Shop to an owner within the \\"Moravian Family\\" and continue its focus on their 85 congregations. The bookstore is currently owned by Moravian College with day-to-day operations handled by Barnes & Noble College Booksellers. History In 1745, Bishop Augustus Spangenberg of the Moravian Church charged Samuel Powell, an innkeeper on the South Side of Bethlehem, to open and operate a bookstore. In its early years, the store served to cater to the needs of the church, importing and selling devotional and liturgical materials for use by churchgoers, missionaries, and students.Clark, Kathryn Finegan,\\"Moravian Book Shop\\" , Lehigh Valley Marketplace Over the next century, the store was moved to several locations, including, for a time, to Philadelphia, where it existed as both a seller and printer of books.Kawaguchi, Karen, \\"Moravian Book Shop Evolves Through History\\", Publishers Weekly, June 28, 1999 In 1871, the store was moved to a building near the Central Moravian Church on Main Street in Bethlehem. The store occupies the same space to this day, though it has expanded several times in the intervening 140 years and now fills in four buildings. The bookstore is now owned by the Ministers' Pension Fund of the Northern Province of the Moravian Church and is overseen by a board of directors which is appointed by the church. In 2015, the store opened its first satellite location in Center City Allentown as part of the Two City Center complex. The location was closed in May 2017 to refocus on the Bethlehem location and remaining stock was moved there. In April 2018, nearby Moravian College announced the acquisition of the shop. The historic bookstore would become the central student bookstore for the college. Employee Leo Atkinson created a petition to the college to reconsider their decision. Features The Moravian Book Shop features a book section that includes indie best sellers, trade books, and select books highlighting the history of Moravians, Bethlehem, Bethlehem Steel, the Lehigh Valley and Pennsylvania. In addition, the Moravian Book Shop sells and buys back student textbooks. The Book Shop also stocks Moravian College apparel and gift items, reference books, stationery and art supplies, greeting cards, candy, and health and beauty aids. In addition, the inventory also includes traditional Moravian- and Bethlehem-themed gifts and College faculty- and alumni-authored books. The store also hosts weekly reading and discussion groups and monthly events with authors.Moravian Book Shop website Moravian Stars The store specializes in the sale of hundreds of Moravian Stars, also called Advent Stars, which were first produced in 19th-century Germany.Shea, Suzanne Strempek.

It is the only L-shaped village in Scotland. It is surrounded by farmland. Toponomy In common with a number of villages in the Carse of Gowrie, Inchyra has the Celtic placename element innis meaning \\"island\\". Carses such as the Carse of Gowrie are estuarine landforms that have been uplifted by isostatic rebound following the last glacial period. It is likely that Inchyra was an island in the firth of Tay at the time of its settlement. Inchyra Stone In 1945 a class I Pictish stone was unearthed during ploughing in a field at Inchyra. The stone is inscribed with a variety of Pictish symbols, including a double disc, mirror and comb, two fish and a serpent as well as an Ogham inscription. It is now on display at Perth Museum. Roman archaeology In June 1993, a small hoard of eight Roman Denarii coins were discovered at Inchyra, subsequently being declared as treasure trove and placed in Perth Museum.

Dhanushkodi, the Indo-Sri Lankan border town, is the crucible wherein History is brewing this concoction of defeated lives and exhausted dreams. Hope is a big word and resistance but a tired expression. Three decades of struggle for a nation is washed out, a race obliterated. For, there is no one fighting their war back home now.

Their interactions with the dead or living refugees, their skirmishes with the Indian and Sri Lankan States, their personal lives overrun by external events - form the kernel of this narration. Soori, a half-wit Sri Lankan Tamil, who connects to the world through his radio, stands aloof in this bleak world of despair sending lightning jolts of truth into the dark recesses of History. No wonder, he vanishes into the blue and Manimekalai is forced by the State to return to the world of civil obedience. Munusamy is killed and Rosemary turns to her God, the same God who parted the Red Sea to save his flock in their flight from annihilation.  Production  This film was a people participatory work, says director. The movie was filmed in Dhanuskodi, India which is just 18 km from Sri Lanka. When talking about the movie, the director says, the real victory of her movie would be, even if one fisherman is saved from killing of Sri Lankan navy. Writer, director, producer Leena Manimekalai, tried gather funds via crowd sourcing for the distribution of the movie.

It is a variation of the corrugated-waveguide filter but with longitudinal slots cut through the corrugations resulting in an internal structure that has the appearance of a waffle-iron. Waffle-iron filters are particularly suitable where both a wide passband, and a wide stopband free of spurious transmission modes, are required. They also have a high power- handling capability. Applications include suppressing the harmonic output of transmitters and the design of wide-band diplexers. They are also used in industrial microwave manufacturing processes to prevent the escape of microwave radiation from the microwave chamber. Filters with an analogous design are now appearing in photonics, but, due to the higher frequency, at a much smaller scale. This small size allows them to be incorporated into integrated circuits. Design techniques for waffle-iron filters include image- parameter methods, network synthesis methods and numerical analysis methods. Network synthesis is a more advanced method than image-parameter techniques but the latter can still be used where a simple repeated-pattern design is desired. Numerical methods can be used to analyse either design. Description The waffle-iron filter was invented by Seymour B. Cohn at Stanford Research Institute in 1957.Young, p.10 The basis for the filter is the corrugated-waveguide filter. This consists of a series of ridges, or corrugations, across the width of the filter. There are corrugations inside the waveguide on both the top and bottom surfaces. The rising and descending ridges are aligned with each other but do not meet in the middle; there is a gap in between. In the waffle-iron filter there are, in addition, slots cut through the ridges down the length of the waveguide. This leaves a matrix of square islands, or teeth, on the top and bottom surfaces.Matthaei et al., p.390 Waffle-iron filters are, in essence, low-pass filters but like all waveguide devices will not transmit anything below the waveguide cutoff frequency. Waffle-iron filters are used where both a wide passband with low insertion loss, and a wide (sometimes very wide) stopband are needed. They are particularly good where suppression of spurious modes is required.Levy, pp.526, 527 Manuilov and Kobrin, 2005, p.93 Manuilov et al., 2009, p.526 Matthaei et al., p.390 Waffle-iron filters have been built with a wide stopband and attenuation.Bingham, p.29 Even wider stopbands are possible with a relaxed attenuation specification.Matthaei et al., p.393 Operation One of the performance issues addressed by the waffle-iron filter is that in many waveguide filters the attenuation is dependent on the transmission modes of the incident signal and some filters can be quite bad at suppressing spurious modes which may be contained in this signal. For instance, with the corrugated waveguide filter, on which the waffle-iron filter is based, attenuation of TEn0 modes in the stopband is strongly dependent on the mode number. This is not the case with the waffle-iron filter which attenuates all TEn0 modes nearly equally up to a certain frequency. The limit is the frequency at which the distance between the metal teeth is greater than half the free-space wavelength of the signal. The reason for the waffle-iron design's good performance in this respect is that the distance between the teeth is the same in both the longitudinal and transverse directions and nearly the same in all directions in between. This makes the waffle-iron nearly isotropic to TEM waves in all these directions. Since any TEn0 mode wave can be decomposed into two TEM mode waves travelling in different diagonal directions, all TEn0 modes are affected nearly equally.Matthaei et al., pp.390–391 Incident signals containing TM modes above a certain frequency can generate modes which propagate along the longitudinal slots with the slots themselves acting as waveguides. The point at which this can start to happen is the frequency at which the height of the slot is greater than half the free-space wavelength of the signal. If this frequency is above the required stopband of the filter the effect is of no consequence. Otherwise, steps outside the filter are needed to suppress these modes and can be incorporated into the end-matching sections.Matthaei et al., pp.391–392 Other design criteria will usually result in a filter which does not match the waveguides to which it is to be connected at its input and output. There are many structures that can be used for matching but a useful one here is the stepped-impedance transformer which has the added advantage of helping to suppress the unwanted slot modes.Matthaei et al., pp.392–393 Applications A common application of waffle-iron filters is to remove the harmonics of transmitters, such as high power radar, before applying to the antenna. Legislation in most jurisdictions requires strict limits on out-of-band transmissions since these can cause serious interference with other stations. This is an application that usually requires a very wide stopband, a characteristic of waffle-iron filters. For instance, to remove all harmonics up to the fifth it is necessary for a low-pass filter to have a stopband greater than three times the passband.Gerke and Kimmel, pp.7–8 Levy, p.526 Mendenhall, pp.805–806 The wide-band nature of waffle-iron filters finds applications in satellite communications. A satellite earth station may have multiple diplexers connected to a multi-band antenna feeder. Each diplexer delivers a wide-band signal in a different band and it is essential that its signal does not contain out-of-band components, particularly harmonics. These can seriously interfere with, or even stop entirely, communication in another band. The diplexer must therefore have a stopband that is even wider than the passband. For this reason, as well as the other advantages of waffle-irons, these diplexers are commonly made to a waffle-iron design.Manuilov and Kobrin, 2005, p.93 Manuilov et al., 2009, p.526 Waffle-iron filters are used in industrial microwave processes. The many industrial applications of microwave energy include drying of food products and industrial films, heating, such as in polyurethane foam production, melting, rendering, sterilising, and vulcanisation. In high-volume production the process is continuous necessitating openings to the microwave chamber where the product can be fed in and exit. Steps need to be taken to prevent unsafe levels of microwave radiation escaping from these apertures which are often large to accommodate the product. It is usual to line the product feed ducts with microwave absorbent material for this purpose. However, the absorbed microwaves have a heating effect and this can be severe enough to damage the absorbent material. Waffle-iron filters are a useful alternative because the product can be passed between the filter's teeth. An ideal filter will reflect all the unwanted radiation rather than absorbing it so will not suffer from overheating. This is an example of a filter being used in a choke application. In some processes both techniques are used simultaneously. The waffle-iron is placed nearest the microwave chamber to first reduce the energy to a level which will not cause the absorbent lining to overheat. The absorbent lining then removes the small residue.Mehdizadeh, pp.329–331 Metaxas and Meredith, pp.301–303 Design Waffle-iron filter teeth types. Bottom rows only are shown. A: square teeth. B: rounded teeth. C: circular teeth with TE0n mode suppression wires. The number of teeth, their size, and the gap between them are all design parameters that can be used to control the design of the filter. As an example, a filter with a 3:1 stopband might have five teeth across the width of the waveguide. The number of rows of teeth down the length of the waveguide primarily affects the stopband attenuation. The more rows of teeth, the better the attenuation, each row being equivalent to a lumped element circuit filter section. A filter with ten rows of teeth has a theoretical stopband rejection of around and one with seven rows around .Matthaei et al., pp.392, 938 The earliest waffle-iron filters were designed with the image parameter method of filter design. Cohn's original data for the corrugated filter could also be applied to the waffle-iron with only a small adjustment of one parameter. An alternative approach to using Cohn's empirical data, but still an image parameter design, is due to Marcuvitz who used a waveguide T-junction equivalent circuit to represent corrugations and this method was later extended by others to waffle-irons.Cohn, pp.651–656 Marcuvitz, pp.336–350 Matthaei et al., p.392 One of the main drawbacks of the image parameter design method in this, as in other, filters is that the impedance match at the terminations is not good. This usually requires that impedance matching sections are provided at the input and output. These usually take the form of multi-section stepped impedance transformers. These add considerably to the overall length of the filter.Levy, p.526 Matthaei et al., pp.397–408 A small improvement to matching can be had by starting and ending the filter on a half-space instead of a full tooth or space. The lumped circuit equivalent of this is T-half-sections terminating the filter at either end. Starting and ending on a half-tooth instead of a half space is the equivalent of Π-half-sections.Matthaei et al., pp.393, 404–408 Direct synthesis avoids many of the problems of the image parameter method. Not only does it take better account of the terminal impedances but the designer has additional degrees of freedom allowing improved matching. The size and gaps of the teeth are tapered in this method of design. That is, the teeth can be different sizes according to their position in the filter, compared with an image design where all sections are identical. With this approach, the original specification for passband and stopband can be kept while simultaneously improving the impedance matching. The stepped impedance transformers can be dispensed with, or at least significantly reduced in size.Levy, p.1 Synthesis methods allow better control of the precise filter response. A common response function used by filter designers is the Chebyshev filter which trades steepness of the transition band for passband ripple. However the Chebyshev response is not always the best choice for waffle-iron filters. Low-pass waveguide filters do not pass frequencies all the way down to zero because of the waveguide cutoff effect. A better choice is the Achieser-Zolotarev filter. This filter is based on Zolotarev polynomials (which include the Chebyshev polynomials as a special case) discovered by Yegor Ivanovich Zolotarev. The Zolotarev response has a stopband at low frequency, the cutoff of which can be controlled by the designer so it is not detrimental in a waveguide filter. The advantage of the Zolotarev response is that it results in a filter with a better impedance match to the connecting waveguides compared to the Chebyshev filter or image-parameter filters.Levy, pp.528–530 Waffle-iron filter with two-section matching transformer (with a tuning-screw in each section). There is similar transformer on the other side of the waffle-iron section.Another design approach, particularly suitable for CAD because it is a numerical method, is to decompose the filter into a number of finite elements. These elements are a large number of simple steps and ridges. A number of methods are available to analyse the individual elements. The mode matching technique expands the field equations of the element into a series of eigenfunctions and then for each mode matches the field at the interface between elements.Van Riemen, p.36 The Galerkin method expands the field equations into polynomial functions such as Gegenbauer polynomials or Chebyshev polynomials. These methods can be mixed according to what is convenient for a particular type of element. Whichever analysis method is used, the final output needed is the scattering parameters matrix for each element. The overall filter response is then found from the combined scattering matrix of all the individual element matrices. This method is analytic rather than synthetic, that is, a trial design must first exist in order to be analysed unlike synthesis methods where the starting point is a prescribed transfer function from which a design is synthesised.Arndt et al., p.186 Manuilov and Kobrin, 2005, pp.93–94 Manuilov et al., 2009, pp.527–528 TE0n modes should not, in theory, be excited in the waffle-iron filter because of its vertical symmetry about the centre- line. However, in practice they can be caused by poorly mating waveguide flanges or misaligned teeth. These spurious modes can be suppressed by fitting thin wires across the width of the filter in the space between the teeth on the vertical centre-line of the waveguide. This can be a better solution than over-engineering the components to high precision and results in a more robust design.Matthaei et al., pp.951–952 Multiple unit filters Very wide stopbands can be achieved by cascading several waffle-iron filter units together. Each unit is designed for a stopband in different, but overlapping, ranges. The filter with the highest frequency stopband has the smallest, and greatest number, of teeth. The units are connected together with λ/4 impedance transformer sections of waveguide in order of progressively higher frequency operation. Since the impedance transformers are operating at different frequencies the ones connected to the units with smallest teeth are shorter than those connected to units with larger teeth. Matthaei gives an example of a three unit waffle-iron filter designed to stop all harmonics of the passband from the second to the tenth – a combined stopband of to with a rejection of .Matthaei et al., pp.938–941 Sharp, p.111 Using network synthesis design techniques the need for multiple units can be reduced or eliminated. If tapering of the teeth is allowed, a two-unit design can often be reduced to a single unit with the same wide stopband. This approach can halve the length of the complete filter.Levy p.530 High power At high power, arcing can occur at the corners of the filter teeth due to strong electric fields being present at sharp corners. This limits the power-handling capability of the filter. The effect can be mitigated by rounding the edges of the teeth. Completely circular teeth are best of all for power handling. Circular teeth will handle about 1.4 times the power capability of square teeth without arcing. For instance Matthaei describes a passband filter with rounded teeth and a wide stopband with a power-handling capability of . A similar filter with circular teeth, on the other hand, can handle . Using power dividers to connect filters in parallel and then combining their outputs can provide even greater power handling.Matthaei et al., pp.393, 408–409, 938–947 Photonics Filter structures that are analogous to the waffle-iron filter are used in photonics but operate at a much higher frequency and are much smaller than those used in electronics. Like the waffle-iron, these structures have good suppression of unwanted transmission modes. A filter operating in the band has been built using parallel-plate waveguide (PPWGAvetisyan et al., p.327) technology with of rejection in the stopband. The filter was constructed of two plates of highly polished aluminium spaced apart. The teeth consisted of gold-sputtered aluminium cylinders on a silicon die. In this design it is not convenient to provide a gap through the centre of the teeth as is done in the microwave version. Instead, the air gap is provided between the top of the teeth and one of the PPWG plates.Bingham, pp.10–31 These filters can be made using the standard semiconductor industry photolithography manufacturing techniques. Consequently, they are suitable for incorporating into on-chip integrated circuits, as is PPWG technology in general.Bingham pp.5–6, 17–18 Avetisyan et al., p.331 References Bibliography *Arndt, F.; Beyer, R.; Hauth, W.; Schmitt, D.; Zeh, H., \\"Cascaded wide stop band waffle-iron filter designed with a MM/FE CAD method\\", 29th European Microwave Conference, 1999, pp. 186–189. *Avetisyan, Yu.H.; Manukyan, A.H.; Hakobyan, H.S.; Poghosyan, T.N., \\"Two-Dimensional confined Terahertz wave propagation in gap plasmon waveguide formed by two cylindrical surfaces\\", Modern Optics and Photonics: Atoms and Structured Media, pp. 325–338, World Scientific, 2010 . *Bingham, Adam L., Propagation Through Terahertz Waveguides with Photonic Crystal Boundaries, ProQuest, 2007 . *Cohn, Seymour B., \\"Analysis of a wide-band waveguide filter\\", Proceedings of the IRE, vol.37, iss.6, pp. 651–656, June 1949. *Gerke, Daryl; Kimmel, Bill, EDN Designers Guide to Electromagnetic Compatibility, Newnes, 2002 . *Gurzadyan, Gagik G.; Kryuchkyan, Gagik Yu; Papoyan, Aram V., Modern Optics and Photonics: Atoms and Structured Media, World Scientific, 2010 . *Levy, Ralph, \\"Tapered corrugated waveguide low-pass filters\\", IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, vol.21, iss.8, pp. 526–532, August 1973. *Manuilov, Mikhail B.; Kobrin, Konstantin V., \\"Low- loss waffle-iron filters for multiband feeders of reflector antennas\\", Proceedings of International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP2005), pp. 93–96, Seoul: Korea Electromagnetic Engineering Society, 2005 . *Manuilov, M.

DeForte, 392 U.S. 364 (1968), is a decision of the United States Supreme Court on privacy and the Fourth Amendment. It originated in the lower courts as United States ex rel. Frank DeForte, appellant v. Vincent R. Mancusi, Warden of Attica Prison, Attica, New York, appellee, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus by a prisoner who had exhausted all his state appeals. By a 6–3 margin the Court affirmed the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit's reversal of a district court denial of the petition. The prisoner, Frank DeForte, was one of several labor union officials on Long Island who had been convicted of racketeering-related charges connected to a scheme in which they attempted to monopolize the juke box market in the New York Metropolitan area. Early in the investigation, local prosecutors had issued a subpoena duces tecum for records from the union officials. When they refused to comply, the prosecutors went to the union offices themselves and seized the records from the officials' desks themselves. DeForte had been present and voiced his objections. The state later admitted the action was illegal but the documents, which formed the bulk of the case against the officials, were not suppressed at trial. Both the state's appellate court and the New York State Court of Appeals sustained the verdict, and all the defendants went to prison. There they began filing habeas petitions to the federal courts. The first, alleging that the court's orders to the jury to continue deliberating after they had done so for almost 24 hours and twice asked for a break constituted coercion, was denied. DeForte's second, arguing as he had at trial and on his state appeal, that the search of his desk violated his reasonable expectation of privacy and thus his Fourth Amendment rights, was the one the Supreme Court heard. Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote for the majority that under the Court's recent holding in Katz v. United States, DeForte had a reasonable expectation of privacy over the papers he kept at work even though they were not his personal property and he shared the office with his co-defendants. Nor did the subpoena authorize the prosecutor to act as he might with a search warrant, since the subpoena was not subject to independent judicial review before its execution. In dissent, Hugo Black, who had also dissented in Katz, said he could not find why the Court chose to depart from previous holdings that documents in the possession of one's employer enjoyed no Fourth Amendment protection, and was misreading the cases it relied on. The case is seen as a seminal case in privacy law, since it extended it for the first time to a non-residential space. Lower courts have used it to guide them in distinguishing Fourth Amendment claims into the present day. The Supreme Court has, in later holdings, extended it to include public employees during administrative investigations and considered its application in the context of modern telecommunications. Background of the case For most of American history the Fourth Amendment's requirement that the people \\"be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures\\" was taken to apply strictly only to their physical bodies and real property they had an ownership interest in. Advances in communications technology at the start of the Information Age would challenge that. In the 1928 case Olmstead v. United States the Court upheld a bootlegging conviction that relied solely on transcripts of telephone conversations that had been obtained through warrantless wiretapping of the defendants' telephone lines, an action illegal under Washington state law.Olmstead v. United States, The majority held that since the Prohibition agents had not actually trespassed on the bootleggers' property to place the wiretaps, the Fourth Amendment had not been violated, and that the language of the amendment in any event referred only to material things.Olmstead, 277 U.S. at 462–69, Taft, C.J. One of the dissenting justices, Louis Brandeis, wrote a frequently quoted opinion arguing that the Fourth Amendment protected not just those rights associated with property but \\"the right to be let alone\\", speculating that future technological advances might be yet more intrusive.Olmstead, 277 U.S. at 471, 478, Brandeis, J., dissenting. In the ensuing decades the Olmstead majority's holding began to seem more and more inadequate. Telephone use became more widespread, and the public grew concerned over the idea that anyone, not just the government, could listen into private and intimate conversations which once took place only in person. Improvements in audio recording technology meant that such intrusions were possible without a human actually present. This led Congress to pass anti- wiretapping statutes which still allowed law enforcement to listen in with the telephone company's permission, since those companies were the lawful owners of the wires and switches where the wiretapping could take place. The Warren Court was the first to recognize that the traditional application of the Fourth Amendment to property one owned had its shortcomings. In Jones v. United States, a drug prosecution where the defendant had challenged the use of evidence taken during a search of an apartment he had access to, the Court had extended the Fourth Amendment's protections to anyone \\"legitimately on the premises\\"., Frankfurter, J.That aspect of Jones would be overruled as too broad in Rakas v. Illinois, , which replaced it with a rule that defendants must show that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched. A line of cases in the area of reproductive freedom had also entertainedPoe v. Ullman, . and eventually adoptedGriswold v. Connecticut, . the idea that personal privacy in that area was protected independently of the premises of a dwelling. In Mapp v. Ohio, the Court extended the exclusionary rule under which evidence obtained unconstitutionally cannot be used at trial, to state as well as federal prosecutions,Mapp v. Ohio, greatly increasing the cases of alleged Fourth Amendment violations it was asked to review. Underlying prosecution In the late 1950s, allegations of racketeering activities by some labor unions led the U.S. Senate to create a Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management to investigate.\\"New Senate Unit to Widen Inquiry In Labor Rackets.\\" New York Times. January 24, 1957; \\"Teamster Study Is 3 Months Old.\\" New York Times. May 26, 1957; \\"Senate Votes Inquiry on Labor Rackets.\\" New York Times. January 31, 1957. It soon became known as the Labor Rackets Committee or the McClellan Committee, after its chair, John McClellan of Arkansas. Chief committee counsel Robert F. Kennedy was frequently criticized for apparent disregard of witnesses' constitutional rights. The committee and its large staff devoted much of their attention to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), where Jimmy Hoffa had been allegedly working with organized crime figures to unseat Dave Beck as union head. It feared that if Hoffa led the Teamsters, the union would have enough power to disrupt the U.S. economy. The committee had focused on some of the paper locals Hoffa had purportedly created to stack votes in his favor during the leadership election.Loftus, Joseph A. \\"Top Beck Aide Links Hoffa to 'Phony' Teamster Locals.\\" New York Times. August 20, 1957. The officers of one, Local 266 in Manhattan, were nominally attempting to organize juke box and coin-operated game servicemen in the New York metropolitan area. District attorneys around New York began their own investigations into allegations that Local 266 was trying to intimidate employers into allowing the Teamsters to represent their employees instead of other unions they already had collective bargaining agreements with. McClellan called Local 266 \\"phony and gangster-ridden\\". =Criminal investigation and trial= In May 1959 prosecutors from the Nassau County district attorney's office, who had been investigating Local 266 for three months, subpoenaed its records. The local refused to produce them. The prosecutors then went to the headquarters themselves with the subpoena and took, according to a contemporary account, \\"records, membership lists, bank books and even pictures on the wall.\\" The local's vice president, Frank DeForte, was present at the time and objected strongly to the seizure of the documents. The Nassau County prosecutors took the documents back to Mineola and presented it to a grand jury. It indicted 15 defendants, including DeForte and the other Local 266 officials, on 16 separate counts of conspiracy, criminal coercion and extortion. The trial began the following February. Over the next three and a half months the jury heard 125 witnesses and reviewed 100 written documents submitted as exhibits. In May, after closing arguments, it received its instructions and withdrew to deliberate over the fate of the 10 remaining defendants. After breaks for lunch and dinner, the jury continued deliberating until late in the evening. The foreman sent a note to the judge saying jurors were fatigued and asking for advice. The judge asked if they wanted coffee and sandwiches. The foreman responded that the jurors felt that they were unable to reach a decision on all the charges and could benefit from some rest. =All-night jury deliberations= The jurors were told to continue. They took their sandwiches and coffee four hours later, at 2:30 a.m. Almost two hours further into the night, the foreman sent another note to the judge saying the jurors were at an impasse and needed to get some sleep. The judge called them into the courtroom to tell them that it would not be until 6 a.m. at the earliest that any hotel rooms could be arranged and that any rest they got would thus be brief as they would have to return to the courtroom by 1 p.m. He asked if they would rather continue to deliberate, resolve their impasse and go home.DeGrandis, 335 F.2d at 174–75. The foreman said the jury would prefer to get some sleep. The judge responded by telling them to go back to their rooms while overnight accommodations were sought. At 5 a.m. he summoned them back into the courtroom to tell them that most of the nearby hotels and motels were fully booked. The only possibility that might work was four rooms at a motel where cots could be set up. The foreman asked to retire and consider this. Again the judge reminded them it might be better to continue on.DeGrandis, 335 F.2d at 175. After the jury withdrew, they again began to deliberate, requesting more exhibits, testimony and additional instructions. Following a breakfast break after 6 a.m., they returned to the courtroom and were instructed as they had requested. The jury again withdrew for three hours. As noon approached the judge sent a note asking if they were close to a verdict. The reply said they were. Following another helping of sandwiches and coffee, they returned with their verdict just before 2 p.m., 28 hours after deliberations began. They returned a mixture of verdicts. For one defendant they could not agree; another was acquitted of all charges. The remaining defendants were convicted of at least some of the charges.DeGrandis, 335 F.2d at 176. At sentencing most received fines and suspended sentences. The judge was harsher with DeForte and the other Local 266 officials, president Joseph De Grandis and secretary Ernest Zundel. All three were sentenced to prison. De Grandis, with a prior felony conviction, got seven and a half to eight years. DeForte and Zundel, both of whom were first-time felons, got terms of three to five years. =Appeals to state courts= Lawyers for the three indicated they would appeal the conviction. They challenged the original seizure of the papers by the district attorney's office as unconstitutional, and argued the long deliberations without sleep had improperly coerced the jury and tainted the result. Two years later, in 1962, the Second Department of the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, upheld the conviction. A five-judge panel handed down a short decision addressing the Fourth Amendment claim. \\"Such records were not the defendants' private, personal papers; they were the property of the union\\", the appellate division wrote. \\"Whatever possession the defendants had of these records was merely in their capacity as representatives of the union, and not in their private or individual capacity.\\" It dismissed the other arguments as \\"untenable\\". The defendants next took the case to the New York Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state. In a 4–3 decision, it affirmed the Appellate Division without comment late in 1962. The dissenters, including Chief Judge Charles S. Desmond, found the dispositive issue was not the seizure of the documents but the long deliberations. \\"[K]eeping the jury in deliberation for over 24 consecutive hours without any respite, and after they had advised the court of their fatigue on more than one occasion,\\" they wrote, \\"constitutes coercion of the jury as matter of law.\\" The next year the Supreme Court denied certiorari, ending the original case.Certiorari denied, . =Habeas petitions= The three began serving their prison sentences in the Hudson Valley. De Grandis went to Green Haven Correctional Facility in Dutchess County, while DeForte and Zundel were sent to Sing Sing in Westchester County. Both prisons were within the jurisdiction of the federal Southern District of New York, and the three filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus with that court, alleging they had been unlawfully detained due to the alleged constitutional violations involved in both the evidence collection and trial. Jury coercion claim Their first petition, arguing as the dissenters at the state Court of Appeals had that the marathon jury deliberation was coercive, was rejected. They appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. In July 1964 a three-judge panel upheld the lower court. Leonard Moore recounted the history of the deliberations in detail. He criticized the trial judge for failing to anticipate that the jury might need to spend the night in a hotel, but found that the lack of sleep had not unduly affected its verdict. \\"[T]he mere fact that a jury has been without sleep will not vitiate its verdict if its agreement was deliberate and voluntary and not due to fatigue and exhaustion,\\" Moore wrote. He found it significant that the jury had, when finally offered the real possibility of sleep in the early morning, instead chosen to continue deliberations and made some progress. \\"It might well be that, figuratively speaking, the jury had gotten its second wind.\\" He found further proof of the jury's clarity of mind in the range of verdicts it delivered, suggesting it had seriously considered the case and not just reached a verdict out of sleep- deprived desperation. Fourth Amendment claim DeForte was transferred further upstate, to Attica. In 1966 he filed another habeas petition against the warden, Vincent Mancusi, with the Western District of New York. This time he focused on the use of unlawfully obtained evidence at trial. He initially challenged both the seizure of the documents and the use of illegal wiretaps, but later withdrew the latter claim. Two related arguments were raised against the document seizure. The first was procedural. Since Mapp had been decided prior to his conviction, DeForte argued, it should be applied to the trial and the evidence suppressed. More specifically to the case, he cited Jones. In an early interpretation of that case, Henzel v. United States, the Fifth Circuit had held that a defendant convicted of mail fraud had standing to challenge the use of corporate records against him. Judge John Oliver Henderson denied the petition late in the year. He found Henzel to be a flawed precedent, writing that it \\"ignore[s] the personal nature of Fourth Amendment rights\\". Jones could not easily be applied to situations where corporate or organizational records were involved, even where, as in Henzel, the defendant had been the sole stockholder of the corporation from which the records were seized. \\"Envision, for example, a case in which the corporation's janitor was present during an illegal search and seizure but the corporation's vice- president was not.\\"DeForte, 261 F.Supp. at 581–82. He found a more recent interpretation of Jones, the Third Circuit case United States v. Grosso, to be controlling. There the court had upheld the use of records seized from a third party against a defendant convicted of involvement in a gambling ring. It held that the Supreme Court had only intended Jones to be applicable to a limited class of cases, and that those involving the seizure of corporate records did not fall into that category. Since that was in accord with similar precedent in the Second Circuit, he found DeForte had no standing to challenge the use of the union records and denied the petition. Aware that there was recent authority to the contrary, he certified probable cause for an appeal.DeForte, 261 F.Supp. at 582. In June 1967 the Second Circuit heard the case again. Success on appeal A few weeks later DeForte prevailed. Judge Irving Kaufman wrote for another panel that reversed Henderson and ordered the writ issued. \\"The quest for a clear solution to the perplexing query as to who may challenge an allegedly unlawful search and seizure has been confounded by thorny problems\\" he began. After Mapp, state courts had to consider that question too, with only a few potentially conflicting Supreme Court decisions to guide them. Kaufman called Jones the first serious attempt to develop standards for making these decisions.DeForte, 379 F.2d at 899–901. Jones had presented a defendant with a quandary: if he had, as case law up to that point required, claimed a possessory interest in the seized narcotics in order to suppress them, he would also have been incriminating himself, in violation of his rights under the Fifth Amendment. The Court resolved the issue by holding that in cases where mere possession of the property in question was the offense alleged, defendants need not have to admit to such ownership to challenge the admissibility of such evidence, and that they only had to demonstrate they were legitimately on the premises where the search occurred.Jones, 362 U.S. at 263, Frankfurter, J., cited at DeForte, 379 F.2d 901–02.As noted above, the \\"legitimately on premises\\" rule was overruled in Rakas, in favor of a doctrine that defendants must show they a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched. The other half of Jones, the \\"automatic standing\\" rule for defendants charged with possession offenses, was formally overruled in United States v. Salvucci , where the majority held that the principle established by Simmons v. United States, , that testimony by defendants at an evidentiary hearing challenging the admissibility of evidence under the Fourth Amendment could not be used against them at trial, made the Jones rule unnecessary. But while Jones had said what was not necessary to challenge a search, it did not say what was. That question would have to be established on a case-by-case basis. Turning to the specifics of the case, Kaufman took note of established precedent that the search of an office could be held unconstitutional. The state had argued that despite DeForte's presence in the office he lacked standing since the search was directed at Local 266, not him personally, and he did not have a separate office. But Kaufman noted that as an officer of the local, DeForte would necessarily have been targeted personally by the investigation, and in fact the local itself had not been indicted.DeForte, 379 F.2d at 902–03. \\"[DeForte's] office also served as his place of business and in which he spent a considerable part of each day,\\" Kaufman observed. \\"It appears to us to have been a clear invasion of privacy for the state's officials to have descended upon what was the union's office de jure, but DeForte's office de facto, and without a warrant and over his vigorous protests to have seized books and records, a substantial portion of which he had prepared and which were in his custody.\\" Therefore, he had standing to challenge that search, and thus the conviction had to be set aside. The state had cited other cases decided by the circuit in support of its position, but Kaufman found most of them irrelevant since they preceded Jones. Three had been decided afterwards, but they were easily distinguished.The three were United States v. Fago, 319 F.2d 791 (2d Cir. 1963); United States v. Bozza, 365 F.2d 206 (2d Cir. 1966) and In Bozza the evidence at issue was a stolen gun seized from the home of another member of the burglary ring which none of the appellants had been charged with possessing, nor had they asserted a possessory interest or been present at the execution of the search. In Fago, the corporate records had been lawfully obtained by a county prosecutor looking into alleged corruption and then turned over to the Internal Revenue Service when they were found to contain evidence of tax evasion. And in Granello the defendants never asserted that they had owned or prepared the documents used as evidence of tax evasion. The judge agreed with the position DeForte had argued before Henderson, that Henzel was the most relevant case of the available precedents.DeForte, 379 F.2d at 904–05. Before the Court The prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court, which this time granted certiorari. It put the case on the docket for its 1967 term. At the end of that year, before it heard oral arguments in what was now Mancusi v. DeForte, the Court handed down Katz v. United States, which changed some of the law under which DeForte's case had progressed. Katz arose from circumstances similar to Olmstead, four decades earlier. The defendant, a Southern California bookmaker, had been convicted of gambling charges based largely on recordings of his end of conversations made by a bug on the outside of the telephone booth he had conducted his business from. At trial he had unsuccessfully tried to suppress that evidence; the Ninth Circuit held that it was lawfully obtained since, as in Olmstead, there had been no physical entry into the phone booth.Katz v. United States, . Justice Potter Stewart wrote for a seven-justice majority that overturned Olmstead and recognized the underlying principle of Brandeis's dissent in that case. \\"The Fourth Amendment protects people, not places ... the reach of that Amendment cannot turn upon the presence or absence of a physical intrusion into any given enclosure.\\"Katz, 389 U.S. at 351, 353, Stewart, J. John Marshall Harlan II's concurring opinion used the phrase \\"a reasonable expectation of privacy\\" that came to be the new understanding of what the Fourth Amendment protected.Katz, 389 U.S. at 360, Harlan, J., concurring Decision The Court announced its decision in June 1968, near the end of the term. By a 6–3 vote, they affirmed the appeals court. Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote for the majority that the union records had been improperly seized. Hugo Black, the only dissenter in Katz, wrote for himself and Potter Stewart that the majority had retreated from previous holdings for no clear constitutional reason. Byron White wrote a single-sentence dissent. =Majority= Harlan reiterated that the Court's opinion was based purely on the Fourth Amendment claim DeForte had made, the only one before them. There was no need to decide a Fifth Amendment question, nor whether Fourth Amendment rights were primarily personal, or whether he could have asserted them on the union's behalf as well as his own. The Court considered only whether DeForte had standing to challenge the search, and if so, whether it had been illegal.Mancusi v. DeForte, , 366–67, (1968), Harlan, J. To establish that DeForte had standing, Harlan turned to previous cases. While the Fourth Amendment referred only to the right to be secure in houses, earlier Court decisions had extended that to include businesses as well. Other decisions, even before Jones, had held that that protection applied to even those individuals who did not hold legal title to a property. Finally, there was Katz, which \\"also makes it clear that capacity to claim the protection of the Amendment depends not upon a property right in the invaded place, but upon whether the area was one in which there was a reasonable expectation of freedom from governmental intrusion\\", Harlan wrote, echoing his concurrence in that case. \\"The crucial issue, therefore, is whether, in light of all the circumstances, DeForte's office was such a place.\\"Mancusi, 392 U.S. at 367–68. While the office had been a large room DeForte shared with his fellow officers, with none of it reserved for his personal use, the record did not show where the individual documents had been taken from. DeForte had been present in the office when the subpoena was served, and it was a stipulated fact of the case that he spent much of his time working from that office. Therefore, Harlan concluded, he had custody of the papers at the time they were seized, and could object to the search and seizure. The Court had held in many cases that the search of an office could be challenged as well as a house, and Jones had eliminated the possessory-interest requirement.Mancusi, 392 U.S. at 368–69. If DeForte had had a private office, where he was unlikely to be disturbed at his desk except by those he had allowed in, Harlan continued, he would indisputably have had the standing to challenge the search. \\"It seems to us that the situation was not fundamentally changed because DeForte shared an office with other union officers,\\" he said. \\"DeForte still could reasonably have expected that only those persons and their personal or business guests would enter the office, and that records would not be touched except with their permission or that of union higher-ups.\\" It was irrelevant that other union officials might have consented to the search, since they had not been asked. He considered the situation analogous enough to that in Jones to require the same holding.Mancusi, 392 U.S. at 369–70. With the standing question answered, Harlan turned to the reasonableness of the search. As a matter of state law, a subpoena duces tecum did not allow the prosecutors to seize the documents. The state had already admitted this. Nor was the subpoena constitutionally equivalent to a search warrant, under which the seizure would have been allowed, since it was issued by the district attorney's office and not subject to independent judicial review as the Fourth Amendment required. Harlan took note of the similarity between DeForte's case and Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States,Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, . the case which had established the \\"fruit of the poisonous tree\\" rule excluding otherwise lawfully obtained evidence from use at trial if it was derived from unlawfully obtained evidence. In both cases, prosecutors in New York had responded to an organization's refusal to comply with a subpoena for documents by going to the premises and taking the documents themselves, an action that outraged Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.Silverthorne, 251 U.S. at 391, Holmes, J. \\"[T]here can be no doubt that, under this Court's past decisions, the search of DeForte's office was 'unreasonable' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\\"Mancusi, 392 U.S. at 370–72. =Dissents= \\"In creating this new rule against the use of papers and documents which speak truthfully for themselves, the Court is putting up new hurdles and barriers bound to save many criminals from conviction,\\" Black began. \\"I should not object to this new rule, however, if I thought it was or could be justified by the Fourth or any other constitutional amendment. But I do not think it can.\\"Mancusi, 394 U.S. at 373, Black, J., dissenting. Black did not see how any of the cases cited by Harlan touched on the standing question. Silverthorne did not consider the issue since the documents were accepted as belonging to the corporation or one of its officers, and the \\"legitimately on premises\\" rule from Jones was created to resolve the dilemma it posed with the Fifth Amendment. \\"I must point out that this sweeping dictum is taken somewhat out of context, and cannot possibly have the literal meaning attributed to it,\\" commented Black. \\"It would be quite a hyperbole, I think, to say that the Jones opinion suggested that just any person who happened to be in a house against which an unreasonable search was perpetrated could ask to have all evidence obtained by that search excluded from evidence against him.\\" He alluded to Henderson's hypothetical question about the janitor in his opinion.Mancusi, 394 U.S. at 374–75. DeForte had indeed been legitimately on the premises, Black wrote, and had the majority left it at that its holding would have been sound despite his problems with Jones. But instead, by continuing, it had further highlighted the problems he had had with that decision. \\"This reasoning in terms of 'expectations,' however, requires conferring standing without regard to whether the agent happens to be present at the time of the search or not, a rather remarkable consequence of the statement in Jones\\". He speculated that the Court was planning to eventually \\"eliminate entirely the requirement for standing to raise a search and seizure question and to permit a search to be challenged at any time, at any place, and under all circumstances, regardless of the defendant's relationship to the person or place searched or to the things seized.\\" Such a holding, he cautioned, would elevate the Fourth Amendment to an importance far above any other constitutional provisions.Mancusi, 394 U.S. at 375–76. The facts of the case, to Black, argued against the majority holding. In addition to the open layout of the office, the search was directed not at DeForte but at the local. \\"The police had been investigating a large conspiracy perpetrated through the union, and, at the time, were primarily interested in getting more information about the operation of the union.\\" Since the union had raised no objections to the subpoena, it had a duty to turn over the records demanded.Mancusi, 394 U.S. at 377. Under the holding, the papers could have been returned to Local 266, and then the state could have found another, more constitutional way to obtain them and then retry the defendants. \\"A rule which encourages such circumvention as that is hardly the kind of principle to which this great Court should give birth.\\" Black concluded. \\"I disclaim any responsibility whatever for the new rule.\\" White believed the majority had made too great a grant of privacy. \\"Although the Fourth Amendment perhaps protects the individual's private desk in a union office shared with other officers or employees,\\" he wrote. \\"I dissent from the Court's extension of the protected area to the office door.\\"Mancusi, 394 U.S. at 377, White, J., dissenting. Disposition De Grandis had also been denied his habeas petition, and appealed. His case was argued before the Second Circuit while DeForte's was pending before the Supreme Court, and the appeals court delayed its decision in his case until the Supreme Court made its decision. When it did, it reversed the district court since the circumstances of the case were identical. In 1970 the New York Court of Appeals granted both defendants' requests for a new trial.People v. De Grandis, 27 NY 2d 674 (NY Ct. of Appeals, 1970). Subsequent jurisprudence Mancusi would be the only time the Court granted a habeas petition through the application of the exclusionary rule.Stone v. Powell, ,481 note 15, (1976), Powell, J. It upheld the general permissibility of such claims the following term in Kaufman v. United States,. But seven years after that, in 1976, Stone v. Powell held that state prisoners who had unsuccessfully argued the issue in state appeals would not be allowed to reargue it in federal habeas petitions beyond claims that the matter had not been fully and fairly adjudicated at the lower-court level. The Court at first left most of the details of determining where in the workplace privacy existed to lower courts. Many were, as Mancusi had been, prosecutions where documents taken from offices were the primary evidence against employees, but the lower courts considered cases from other work environments as well. Two tests gradually emerged for determining an expectation of privacy in the workplace: the nexus test, specific to business premises and often preferred when the seized materials were work-related, and the totality test, which was best dispositive to claims of personal property at work. =Early lower-court interpretations= Since Mancusi had not gone into great detail about how DeForte had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a shared workspace, cases in lower courts resolved those issues. Personal, individual and secured spaces, such as a police officer's locker or school guidance counselor's desk drawers, were held during the 1970s to be protected by the Fourth Amendment.Both of those cases involved both public workplaces and a search for personal items unrelated to work, issues the Supreme Court had not yet considered. United States v. Speights, the case involving the police locker, also held that actual practice was more important than a stated policy in determining whether a privacy interest existed. It was more difficult to resolve cases where those factors were not present.See, generally, Morris, Michele; , 23 W. New Eng. L. Rev. 191, 227 (2001). In 1975 the Fifth Circuit decided United States v. Britt, a case used extensively by later courts as a counterbalance to Mancusi. There, the court upheld the mail- fraud conviction of corporate officers based on documents seized from property the corporation rented for storage purposes at a location separate from its offices. Judge Thomas Gibbs Gee distinguished the case from both Mancusi and Henzel v. United States. \\"In both of these cases there was a demonstrated nexus between the area searched and the work space of the defendant. That nexus is absent here.\\" A 1983 Kansas Supreme Court decision used the same logic in holding that a murder defendant had no standing to challenge a search of vacant upper stories at the warehouse where he worked which uncovered incriminating shell casings, since he did not routinely work there.State v. Worrell, 223 Kan. 968, 666 P.2d 703 (Kansas Supreme Court, 1983). Later holdings narrowed the nexus test so that no one factor became absolutely dispositive. In 1979 the Fourth Circuit held in United States v. Torch that the mere fact of a defendant's occasional work-related use of a warehouse searched did not establish a privacy expectation. United States v. Judd, decided by the Fifth Circuit in 1989, upheld a district court ruling that a corporate official's role in preparing seized records did not establish a privacy interest if those documents were kept in a separate office.United States v. Judd, 687 F.Supp. 1052, (N.D.Miss., 1988 aff'd, 889 F.2d 1410 (5th Cir., 1988). The Second Circuit narrowed the nexus further when it upheld a conviction of a bank official in 1990. The defendant's co-ownership of the bank and the presence of the incriminating documents did not give rise to a reasonable privacy expectation, the court held, since they were kept in another employee's office and they would have been subject to routine review by federal regulators.Compare Chuang with United States v. Leary, 846 F.2d 592 (10th Cir. 1988), where a company's voluntary open-door policy was held to not defeat its officials' expectation of privacy in the workplace even though regulators visited frequently. The other test emerged from a dictum in Lewis Powell's concurring opinion in the 1978 Supreme Court case, Rakas v. Illinois, that courts considering the reasonableness of a privacy expectation should consider \\"all the surrounding circumstances.\\"Rakas v. Illinois, , 152 (1978), Powell, J., concurring. It was first applied by the First Circuit in a 1980 case, United States v. Brien. It affirmed a district court's upholding of a search in a securities fraud case that framed the issue with six questions: \\"(1) his [each defendant's] position in the firm; (2) did he have any ownership interest; (3) his responsibilities; (4) his power to exclude others from the area, if any; (5) did he work in the area; (6) was he present at the time of the search?\\" A later Ninth Circuit case referred to \\"the totality of the circumstances\\" and thus gave it its name.In that case the court found a more reasonable expectation of privacy against warrantless video surveillance of a federal agent in his office than he would have had against an actual search of the office. In another First Circuit case, United States v. Mancini, the totality test's consideration of other factors resulted in a different outcome than the nexus test. Federal agents searching for evidence of mayoral corruption had found a box in the attic archive at city hall, clearly marked as belonging to the mayor, with an appointment calendar that became key to the conviction. Since the box was not only marked as the mayor's but stored in a disused area of the building, segregated from other items in that area, and the mayor allowed only his chief of staff to peruse the records, the court found a reasonable expectation of privacy even though he never worked in the attic. Mancini also turned on the defendant's authority to exclude others from the searched space, a question which took on more importance in later cases. In a case with similar circumstances to Mancusi, the Ninth Circuit decided the case differently due to a negative answer to that question. A sweep of an Oregon produce factory by Immigration and Naturalization Service agents looking for illegal aliens was upheld since those detained not only lacked a possessory interest in the property and worked in a large shared space without any space set aside for their individual use, they could not keep anyone out of the building. =O'Connor v. Ortega= It would be almost two decades before the Court heard another case involving privacy rights at work. Like Mancusi, the search at issue in O'Connor v. Ortega involved documents taken from a desk. It presented some questions of first impression for the Supreme Court. Unlike the earlier case, the workplace in question was public rather than private, and the search was undertaken not by an external law enforcement agency but by the employee's own supervisors investigating a possible violation of workplace policy. It was further distinguished by some of the seized material being personal documents unrelated to work. The case began in 1981 when administrators at a state-run psychiatric hospital in California, suspected that Magno Ortega, the head of the hospital's residency program, had coerced money from residents to pay for an office computer. While he was on vacation that summer, they placed him on administrative leave and had security remove items from his desk, ostensibly to sort Ortega's personal property from state property, and change the lock on his door. Some of the personal documents were used to impeach a witness who testified on his behalf at a later hearing before the state personnel board where he unsuccessfully appealed his subsequent dismissal. He filed a Section 1983 civil suit against the administrators and the state in district court. The defendants were granted summary judgement, on the grounds that the intrusion into Ortega's office was for inventory purposes and not a search. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit found differently and reversed. Following a certiorari grant, the Supreme Court heard the case and divided 5–4, with Sandra Day O'Connor writing for four justices in the plurality, Antonin Scalia concurring and Harry Blackmun writing the dissenting opinion.O'Connor v. Ortega, . All justices agreed that public employees had the same Fourth Amendment privacy expectations as their private-sector counterparts; they differed on whether the record established that those had been violated in Ortega's case.Three justices remained from the Mancusi Court; none of whom had played a substantial role in that opinion. Byron White joined Sandra Day O'Connor's plurality; William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall joined Harry Blackmun's dissent. On remand, it took the doctor 12 more years, two trials and two more appellate holdings to win a favorable verdict. While its primary question was whether public employees enjoyed privacy protections, and the holding allowed public employees' supervisors needed merely reasonable suspicion to commence a valid investigatory search,Work-related searches, such as the retrieval of a document or tool from a desk or locker, were held constitutional. O'Connor added some clarifications to Mancusi that lower court justices found useful. Justice O'Connor defined the workplace as \\"includ[ing] those areas and items that are related to work and are generally within the employer's control.\\"O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 715, O'Connor, J. But there was, as there had not been in Mancusi, a distinction between personal and work-related items in the workplace, affecting the privacy expectations in context. \\"[A] photograph placed in a desk or a letter posted on an employee bulletin board,\\" for instance, were personal items that nevertheless became part of the workplace context by virtue of that placement. But packed luggage for a weekend trip or a handbag did not come under a reduced privacy expectation by being brought to work, O'Connor concluded.O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 716. Considerations of privacy must also take into account \\"operational realities\\" of the workplace in question, O'Connor said. \\"An office is seldom a private enclave free from entry by supervisors, other employees, and business and personal invitees. Instead, in many cases offices are continually entered by fellow employees and other visitors during the workday for conferences, consultations, and other work-related visits.\\" As a result of their openness to the public, in fact, some workplaces might not allow any reasonable expectation of privacy.O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 717. What, to O'Connor, distinguished public from private workplaces under the Fourth Amendment was the government's interest as an employer in running an efficient operation. She quoted the Court's holding in Connick v. Myers, a case involving the First Amendment rights of public employees, that \\"government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter\\".Connick v. Myers, , 143, (1983), White, J. Cited at O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 722. Therefore, work- related searches were incident to the primary business of government and thus needed no justification; searches to investigate non-criminal employee misconduct need only meet the reasonable suspicion standardO'Connor, 480 U.S. at 724–25. outlined in Terry v. Ohio.Terry v. Ohio, . Scalia, in his concurrence, attacked O'Connor for articulating an unclear standard and leaving its nuances to future courts. The difference between a public and private employer was dispositive only to the question of whether a search was reasonable, not whether the Fourth Amendment was violated. He would have held that any search reasonable for a private employer would be reasonable for a public employer as well.O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 729 et seq., Scalia, J., concurring. Blackmun's dissent found the search of Ortega's office to have been clearly investigatory and thus the Ninth Circuit should have been affirmed.O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 731 et seq., Blackmun, J., dissenting. =After O'Connor= O'Connor's clarifications preceded a period in which the boundaries between workspace and personal space became less distinct and in some cases began to overlap. In large part this was due to the increasing use of personal computers and the rise of the Internet. Two cases in the decades after O'Connor particularly reflected this. The nexus and totality tests collided in a 1998 Tenth Circuit decision, United States v. Anderson. As part of an FBI child pornography sting operation, the defendant, James Anderson, had been sent what he had been led to believe were videotapes of children with sexually explicit content (they were actually blank). Agents had him under surveillance as he picked up the package, expecting him to take it to his home, for which they already had a search warrant. Instead, he took it to the offices of the company where he was an executive, which were otherwise deserted as it was the Saturday of a Fourth of July weekend.United States v. Anderson, 154 F.3d 1225, 1227–28 (10th Cir., 1998) Concerned that he would realize law enforcement was involved when he discovered the tapes were blank and destroy other evidence that might be present, the agents decided exigent circumstances existed and forced their way into the building. They found Anderson in an unused room where he had drawn the blinds, placed a towel over them and closed the door, preparing to watch the videotape. After confessing and signing a statement that he was aware of his Miranda rights, he consented to a search of his office that produced other child pornography. At his trial, the district court suppressed the confession and all evidence seized after the FBI entered the building. On appeal, the three judges divided. Mary Beck Briscoe wrote for herself and John Carbone Porfilio that the nexus test, under which, as Paul Kelly wrote in dissent, Anderson had no expectation of privacy, was not sufficient to decide this case. \\"[W]e do not believe the fact that a defendant does or does not work in a particular area should categorically control his ability to challenge a warrantless search of that area\\" she wrote. \\"Instead, the better approach is to examine all of the circumstances of the working environment and the relevant search\\", as she read the Supreme Court to have done in Mancusi.Anderson, 154 F.3d at 1230. Briscoe considered it more relevant that Anderson had taken steps to maintain his privacy within the room and that the items were under his immediate control and of a personal, non- business-related nature.Anderson, 154 F.3d at 1231–33.The search was also held unconstitutional because the government had not met its burden of proof that exigent circumstances existed. Kelly argued in dissent that the majority's logic would have extended Anderson's expectation of privacy to the entire office suite he had chosen to isolate himself and watch his videos.Anderson, 154 F.3d at 1234–36. In footnotes, he and Briscoe disagreed about the relevance of Mancini.Anderson, 154 F.3d at 1230, note 2 and 1235, note 1. Anderson had been tracked from his presence online, and the increasing use of the Internet at work, sometimes for personal matters, near the end of the century posed new issues. The Fourth Circuit found the remote search of an employee computer valid in another child-porn case, United States v. Simons, since the Internet use policy defeated any expectation of privacy. A more complicated case concerning privacy expectations around personal Internet use at work confronted the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Ziegler. The case began in 2001 with a tip to the FBI from a Montana Internet Service Provider that someone at Frontline Processing, an online-payments processing company, had accessed child-porn websites from a company computer. An FBI agent, James Kennedy, followed up by contacting officials at the company's information technology (IT) department who verified the report, traced it to Brian Ziegler, the company's director of operations, and found further incriminating evidence in his computer's cache. A copy of the hard drive's contents was made, although it was disputed whether the IT employees did this on their own initiative or at Kennedy's behest. In order to do this two IT employees entered Ziegler's locked office after work hours. The copies made, and the original computer, were turned over to the FBI later. At trial in 2004 Ziegler moved to have the evidence from his hard drive suppressed, arguing that the IT employees, despite their ability and duty to monitor other employees' Internet usage, could not consent and had not consented to do a physical search and seizure in his office on the government's behalf. It was denied, and he later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge as part of a plea bargain in 2005. He then appealed. Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain upheld the district court, writing that due to both the monitoring and social norms regarding privacy expectations on an employer-owned computer, Ziegler had no privacy interest in the computer and thus could not contest the intrusion into his office based on information obtained remotely from that computer.Ziegler, 456 F.3d at 1139–40. Ziegler petitioned for an en banc rehearing. In response, the original panel withdrew its first opinion and issued a newer, longer one, acknowledging as the first had not the \\"seminal\\" importance of Mancusi in establishing an employee's expectation of privacy at work. This time it held that Ziegler did indeed have a privacy interest in his office, but left undisturbed its holding that Frontline's consent overrode that. Another circuit judge moved sua sponte for en banc. The motion failed to attract enough votes, but 11 judges dissented, arguing that office politics at Frontline and statements in the record made it unclear whether there was or could have been consent, and that even if there was that was not enough to overcome Ziegler's privacy rights. In a separate opinion, one dissenter, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, accused the original panel of \\"plucking consent out of its judicial top hat ... Appellate review is not a magic wand and we undermine public confidence in the judicial process when we make it look like it is.\\" The original panel in turn accused the dissenters of \\"post hoc revisionism\\" that adequately justified their original positions.United States v. Ziegler, 05-30177, (9th Cir., 2007) =Ontario v. Quon= In 2010, more than two decades after O'Connor, the Court decided to take another workplace-privacy case, again from an administrative investigation in a public-employment context and . Reflecting cases like Ziegler that had increasingly appeared on appellate dockets, Ontario v. Quon also involved modern personal telecommunications technology. It had worked its way up to the justices from the Ninth Circuit as Quon v. Arch Wireless, a case brought by police officers disciplined for sexually explicit text messages exchanged on department-issued pagers, and the recipients of those text messages. A lieutenant had told the defendant officers, members of the department SWAT team who were routinely exceeding the monthly character limits on the pagers, that despite a department policy allowing only light personal use of the pagers he would not audit the pager messages as long as they reimbursed the department for its overage fees. The lieutenant and chief later wondered if the character limit was artificially low, and ordered an audit and transcripts from the pager provider, limited to those sent during work, which disclosed that most messages had been personal and sometimes explicit. The Ninth Circuit had held the audit an unconstitutional search on the grounds that there were less intrusive ways of obtaining the same information. After a petition for en banc was denied, the Court granted certiorari. Since it was the first telecommunications privacy case to reach the nation's highest court, its possible holding was eagerly anticipated. Ultimately, the Court set no new precedent, unanimously reversing the Ninth Circuit on the grounds that it had never held the \\"least intrusive means\\" test for searches valid. Anthony Kennedy wrote a lengthy majority opinion that concluded the audit of the pagers was reasonably work-related, and declined to establish any new standards for Internet privacy since the technology was still \\"in flux\\" and social expectations around it were insufficiently settled. He specifically cited the lag between Olmstead and Katz as an example to avoid repeating. This reluctance was criticized by Antonin Scalia in a concurrence as \\"a feeble excuse for dereliction of duty\\". Editorials in major newspapers praised this restraint, but later The New York Times ran an article calling the decision \\"almost aggressively unhelpful\\" to lower courts. Eleventh Circuit judge Frank Hull similarly said Quon had \\"a marked lack of clarity\\" when withdrawing and reissuing a previous panel decision controversially holding that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy over the contents of e-mail. Analysis and commentary Michele Morris, an Akron, Ohio, employment lawyer, believes both the nexus and totality tests have proved deficient at protecting privacy at work, and in so doing undermined what the Court sought to accomplish in Mancusi. Instead, she argues, courts should look to the relationships among employees, and between employees and supervisors. \\"The nexus test ignores the realities of workplace delegation of duties\\", she writes. The totality test also, in her opinion, fails because while it considers, as the nexus test does not, an employee's efforts to exclude others from a space instead of their ability or authority to do so. \\"An employee's right to exclude is a direct result of the employment relationship, whereas efforts to exclude may not be.\\" If this mistaken emphasis continued, she fears, private-sector workers will be under the same reasonable-suspicion standard the Court put public employees under in O'Connor.Morris, 227–28. Courts have already, Morris observes, given employment relationships some weight in assessing the validity of a search.She points (222 note 207) to two cases. In United States v. Reeves, 730 F.2d 1189 (8th Cir., 1984), the Eighth Circuit held that a deputy sheriff's \\"common authority\\" with the defendant sheriff over the sheriff's office validated the search, and in United States v. Buettner-Janusch, 646 F.2d 759 (2nd Cir. 1981), the Second Circuit held that the defendant professor's graduate assistants had not only the same common authority but permission to use any aspect of the laboratory equipment gave them the right to consent to a search of it. \\"[T]he courts have erroneously focused on the Supreme Court's Mancusi decision as standing for the principal that an office is a place in which privacy expectations exist, even where it is shared by others,\\" Morris writes. \\"By focusing on that aspect of Mancusi, the courts have failed to apply its more significant recognition that the employment relationship creates a privacy expectation in relation to outsiders, not fellow employees who were entitled to access or persons given access by those employees.\\" The decreasing distinctions between work and home make the problems created by the two existing tests even more compelling. In 1998's Minnesota v. Carter, the Supreme Court had restored the convictions of two men originally observed bagging cocaine through a third man's apartment window, holding that they did not have the privacy expectation usually accorded guests since the sole purpose of their visit was to prepare the cocaine for sale, making their presence on the property purely commercial in nature.Minnesota v. Carter, . \\"It is not too far a reach to extend this rationale to deny Fourth Amendment rights to business guests in one's home for a dinner party or to guests at a Tupperware party\\". What privacy expectations, Morris wondered, would courts apply to people who work out of their homes? And could that result in a general lowering of privacy expectations in the home, where it has traditionally been most protected?Morris, 231. Morris proposes that, in analyzing a privacy claim, courts first define what, in the specific instance, constituted the workplace, and then within that space delineating the public and private areas. After doing so, it could consider to which employees the item or items seized are related to through employment. \\"An employee who delegates work to another would no longer lose Fourth Amendment protection simply by failing to perform the task herself\\", she writes. \\"Likewise, the person to whom the work is delegated is protected regardless of whether she has the authority to retain the materials in her possession.\\" Where a personal item was concerned, the employee would have to demonstrate privacy efforts independent of the employer, such as efforts to exclude coworkers from the item.Morris, 232. Peter Winn, a federal prosecutor in Washington and lecturer at the University of Washington School of Law, takes note in a history of the formulation of the reasonable expectation of privacy standard established in Katz that Mancusi was its first application to a later case.Winn, Peter; , 40 McGeorge L. Rev. 1, 7 note 31 (2009). He finds it interesting that while Harlan first articulated it in his Katz concurrency as a two-part test with a subjective and objective component, in Mancusi he, like other judges after him, refers only to the objective aspect. \\"Perhaps [in Katz], Justice Harlan felt the subjective component of the test was still needed to mirror the old trespass element that an intrusion lack permission,\\" he speculated.40 McGeorge L. Rev. at 12.

As Kathy Fitzpatrick sums up: :::USIA's presence was felt in all corners of the world. Thousands of public diplomacy specialists were stationed in more than 175 :::countries. The Voice of America was broadcasting to 100 million people weekly. USIA was producing books and magazines in more than 100 :::languages. The agency was operating a global library network in 150 countries, teaching English to thousands of foreign citizens, hosting :::exhibits depicting American ideals that drew billions of visitors, producing films and programs widely popular in other nations, and :::administering cultural and euducational exchange programs in which millions of world citizens participated. According to USIA veteran :::Wilson P.

(Hameden: Quinnipiac School of Communications, 2008)http://www.publicdiplomacy.org/Fitzpatrick2008.pdf, 4. : Therefore, a piece of legislation which had serious ramifications for American Public Diplomacy was the Foreign Affairs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 which folded USIA into the State Department and put all International Broadcasting in the hands of the BBG.  In the 21st century  =Structure= :In a 2008 survey of USIA alumni, Kathy Fitzpatrick surmised, \\"Notwithstanding increased funding for public diplomacy in the Middle East after 9/11 and despite dozens of reports by government and private organizations calling for substantial improvements in public diplomacy capabilities, American public diplomacy remains underfunded, undervalued, and underutilized.\\"Fitzpatrick,5 :Since 1999, the Foreign Affairs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, also known as The Consolidation Act, abolished USIA and transferred its functions (information, cultural, and educational operations) to the United States Secretary of State and the United States State Department. Specifically, these functions fall under the leadership of the Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. :On the other hand, the Consolidation Act also established the BBG as an \\"independent entity within the executive branch.\\" U.S. International Broadcasting continues to play a vital role in American public diplomacy.

The 2008 report, entitled Getting the People Part Right, addressed the effect of human resources on public diplomacy. The report concluded: :::The Commission believes that we can significantly enhance the quality and effectiveness of our nation’s :::outreach to foreign publics by: recruiting for the public diplomacy career track in a more focused way; :::testing our recruitees more thoroughly and methodically for their PD instincts, knowledge and skills; :::training them more intensively in the core PD skill-set of persuasive communication; and evaluating them :::more on communication and less on administration.” The 2010 report, entitled Assessing U.S. Public Diplomacy: A Notional Model, was a report based on work done at the direction of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy by the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at The University of Texas at Austin. The report addressed the method of measuring the effectiveness of U.S. Public Diplomacy. Its contents may be summed up as follows: the thermometer is broken, it doesn't work. Moreover, the concluding remarks of the introductory letter from the Commission members offers more insight as to the state of public diplomacy than the actual contents of the report: :::“We offer an observation about the Commission and its work. We fully appreciate that the Commission is :::charged by the President and the Congress to undertake important advisory and oversight work in :::connection with public diplomacy; this work has been made all the more important following the 9/11 :::attacks on our nation and the imperative of conducting thoughtful, effective public diplomacy in support :::of our policy objectives.

V. extremist Islamic propaganda :The 9/11 Commission makes the following assessment:The enemy is not Islam, the great world faith, but a perversion of Islam. The enemy goes beyond al Qaeda to include the radical ideological movement, inspired in part by al Qaeda, that has spawned other terrorist groups and violence. thus our strategy must match our means to two ends: dismantling the al Qaeda network and, in the long term, prevailing over the ideology that contributes to Islamist terrorism.\\"Waller, 377 :Steven Corman, professor at Arizona State University and director of that school’s Consortium for Strategic Communication (http://comops.org/) states that the U.S. must “engage the narrative in the new media. … We should be able to do that better than any terrorist group.” Green, Eric.

As Patricia Harrison, assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs, asserted, \\"if we do not define ourselves, others will do it for us.\\" Waller, 379 :The U.S.' approach has been critiqued for focusing too heavily on promoting secularism, capitalism, and democracy rather than on the rejection of violence and terrorism, and for equating \\"moderation\\" with \\"liberalism\\" in its engagement with the Islamic world. U.S. v. China On February 15, 2011, a minority staff report was submitted to the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. In the letter of transmittal, ranking member Richard Lugar stated: In the same way that our trade with China is out of balance, it is clear to even the casual observer that when it comes to interacting directly with the other nation's public we are in another lop-sided contest. China has a vigorous public diplomacy program, based on a portrayal of an ancient, benign China that is, perhaps, out of touch with modern realities. Nonetheless, we are being overtaken in this area of foreign policy by China, which is able to take advantage of America's open system to spread its message in many different ways, while using its fundamentally closed system to stymie U.S. efforts. :In the arena of public diplomacy, the report cites China's continued suppression of freedom of speech and freedom of information within their country esp. via the internet. The key means of communication which remains open to the U.S., i.e. individual interaction, is an opportunity which the U.S. has failed to promote. The report cites two significant failures on the part of U.S. public diplomacy: # The U.S. has five American centers in all of China. This compared to the seventy some Confucius Institutes throughout the United States. # The Shanghai World Expo was a brilliant opportunity for the U.S., however, while \\"more than 7,000,000\\" Chinese visited the U.S. Pavilion, the U.S. was criticized for its \\"hastily organized presentations and lack of a cogent message.\\" Another U.S. Deficit - China and America - Public Diplomacy in the Age of the Internet.

The former editor of Australia's largest selling travel magazine, Australian Traveller has contributed to News Limited, Conde Nast, Fairfax Media, BBC and several newspapers of note, including South China Morning Post and The Times.  Early career  Rickard began her career in sales for a recruitment agency, a beginning she later credited as providing the foundations for an unusually entrepreneurial outlook as a magazine editor. Under the tutelage of Valerie Khoo she made the transition to journalism, contributing on a freelance basis to titles such as Cosmopolitan, CLEO, Women's Health, GQ, Prevention, and the Sunday Telegraph. At age 23 Rickard was invited to become editor of Healthy Food Guide magazine, making her the youngest Australian editor of a national title at the time. It was her first formal role in publishing. Despite the globally declining climate of magazine sales, the title began to post consistent growth, going on to remain the nation's fastest growing food title for the four consecutive audits of her tenure. Rickard assisted in the launch of the UK edition of the same title, was twice nominated for 'Best Health Magazine' at the Australian Magazine Awards (2009, 2010) and developed an impressive media resume, appearing as a journalist and expert on Australian television programs such as Sunrise, Mornings with Kerri-Anne, Today Tonight and Channel Nine News and presenting regular segments on breakfast radio, most notably on Classic Rock FM's Sydney program 'Mornings with Anthony Maroon' and 4BC's Brisbane breakfast program with Jamie Dunn and Ian Calder. She also worked as an industry advisor to the Australian Democratic Party, providing advice and an industry perspective on shaping government public health policies in 2010. At the time of her resignation, Healthy Food Guide's circulation had grown from 31,670 to 44,025, with her final issue closing at 50,000 copies.http://mags360.com/cookingfoodwine/healthy-food-guide-launched- in-the-uk/ Her first book, Weight Training for Dummies (Australian and New Zealand edition), was released in 2011.  Travel journalism  Rickard joined the team as editor of Australian Traveller magazine in 2012, aged 26. During her three-year tenure she posted consistently aggressive circulation wins, achieving the fastest growing magazine circulation of any title in Australia in the audit period of Jan–Jun 2014. She received significant industry plaudits for her work including top four shortlisting as Editor Of The Year, top-four shortlisting for Magazine of the Year, and winner overall of Niche Magazine of the Year at the prestigious Australian Magazine Awards, as well as finalist listing for Food Travel Writer of the Year by the Australian Society of Travel Writers. Chief among her improvements to the title were the instigation of celebrity covers, which starred notable Australian females such as journalist Lisa Wilkinson, actress Claudia Karvan and model Megan Gale, as well as collaboration with emerging Australian influencers such as Lauren Bath and Melissa Findley (notable given that Instagram was not yet a prominent platform) and an 'image-first' approach to storytelling, which involved sending photographers to destinations without an accompanying writer. This was a tactic she later noted was initially met with reluctance by industry and publicists, until it proved an adaptive means of communication for the changing needs of an increasingly time-poor and digitally focused reader; she also instigated guidelines on a company-wide approach to social media, dedicating considerable resources to the growth of the magazine's official Instagram account at a time when social media was not generally considered a priority for print publications. During her tenure, Rickard also began strengthening the relationship between Australian Traveller and Australia's national tourism body Tourism Australia which, at the time, still included domestic tourism promotion in its remit. The Australian Traveller editorial team, led by Rickard, produced several custom publications on the organisation's behalf. Rickard resigned in February 2015 and commenced an associate editor role at Marie Claire Australia in March 2015, recruited as part of a two-person team by legendary fashion editor, Jackie Frank, to move the publication into its next phase alongside new editor Nicky Briger. After just four months in the role, Rickard resigned in August 2015. Shortly thereafter she rejoined Australian Traveller on a consultative basis, working with Tourism Australia to oversee production of content for its Coastal and Aquatic campaign. In 2016, Rickard was recruited by Fairfax Media as Managing Editor, to lead production on Tourism Australia's million-dollar overhaul of Australia.com alongside multi-award-winning content agency, Storyation. With Tourism Australia's internal team, Rickard and her hand-picked team – some 20 of Australia's most respected travel journalists – produced over 710 feature articles, overhauling site into an editorial destination of its own right. The project achieved measurable increases in several notable metrics; industry publication AdNews later asserted that the project \\"redefine[d] content\\" in the Australian market. The project received Finalist for Best Content Driven website in 2017's worldwide Content Marketing Awards.  Entrepreneurialism  Rickard is part-owner of The Travel Bootcamp, an immersive consumer event with a focus on digital storytelling and influence sponsored by Olympus Australia and Intrepid Travel.

It has two main product offerings that provide modeling and optimization capabilities across a variety of industries. The AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform allows advanced users to develop optimization-based applications and deploy them to business users. AIMMS SC Navigator, launched in 2017, is built on the AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform and provides configurable Apps for supply chain teams. SC Navigator provides supply chain analytics to non-advanced users.  History  AIMMS B.V. was founded in 1989 by mathematician Johannes Bisschop under the name of Paragon Decision Technology. His vision was to make optimization more approachable by building models rather than programming. In Bisschop’s view, modeling was able to build the bridge between the people who had problems and the people helping them solve those problems. AIMMS began as a software system designed for modeling and solving large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems. AIMMS is considered to be one of the five most important algebraic modeling languages. Bisschop was awarded with INFORMS Impact Prize for his work in this language. In 2003, AIMMS was acquired by a small private equity firm. This led to the creation of a partnership program, further technical investment and the evolution of the platform. In 2011, the company launched AIMMS PRO, a way to deploy applications to end-users who do not have a technical background. This was quickly followed by the ability to publish and customize applications using a browser so that decision support applications are available on any device. The company grew and was in 2017 recognized as a top B2B technology in the Netherlands. and was named one of the fastest growing companies in the Netherlands for the second consecutive year.  AIMMS SC Navigator Platform  Along with a growing interest in embedded advanced analytics for supply chain management, AIMMS developed the AIMMS SC Navigator Platform to allow for supply chain analytics. It was launched in October 2017 with three initial cloud-based Apps: Supply Chain Network Design, Sales & Operations Planning and Data Navigator. In 2018 they added Center of Gravity and Product Lifecycle. AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform The AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform consists of an algebraic modeling language, an integrated development environment for both editing models and creating a graphical user interface around these models, and a graphical end-user environment. AIMMS is linked to multiple solvers through the AIMMS Open Solver Interface. Supported solvers include CPLEX, MOSEK, FICO Xpress, CBC, Conopt, MINOS, IPOPT, SNOPT, KNITRO and CP Optimizer. AIMMS features a mixture of declarative and imperative programming styles. Formulation of optimization models takes place through declarative language elements such as sets and indices, as well as scalar and multidimensional parameters, variables and constraints, which are common to all algebraic modeling languages, and allow for a concise description of most problems in the domain of mathematical optimization. Units of measurement are natively supported in the language, and compile- and runtime unit analysis may be employed to detect modeling errors. Procedures and control flow statements are available in AIMMS for * the exchange of data with external data sources such as spreadsheets, databases, XML and text files * data pre- and post-processing tasks around optimization models * user interface event handling * the construction of hybrid algorithms for problem types for which no direct efficient solvers are available. To support the re-use of common modeling components, AIMMS allows modelers to organize their model in user model libraries. AIMMS supports a wide range of mathematical optimization problem types: * Linear programming * Quadratic programming * Nonlinear programming * Mixed-integer programming * Mixed- integer nonlinear programming * Global optimization * Complementarity problems (MPECs) * Stochastic programming * Robust optimization * Constraint programming Uncertainty can be taken into account in deterministic linear and mixed integer optimization models in AIMMS through the specification of additional attributes, such that stochastic or robust optimization techniques can be applied alongside the existing deterministic solution techniques. Custom hybrid and decomposition algorithms can be constructed using the GMP system library which makes available at the modeling level many of the basic building blocks used internally by the higher level solution methods present in AIMMS, matrix modification methods, as well as specialized steps for customizing solution algorithms for specific problem types. Optimization solutions created with AIMMS can be used either as a standalone desktop application or can be embedded as a software component in other applications.

Biography Baudouin was born Nancy, France. In his work, he combined Freudianism with elements of the thought of Carl Jung and Alfred Adler.Cifali M., 'Charles Baudouin', in International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis, Gale Group, Inc. Reprinted here He died, aged 70, in Geneva. After studying literature, Charles Baudouin continued his education in philosophy at the Sorbonne, where he got interested by the personalities of Pierre Janet and Henri Bergson. In 1913, as a young graduate in philosophy, Baudouin was interested by the work of Emile Coué and contributed to making him famous. In 1915, Pierre Bovet and Edouard Claparède invited him to participate in the work of the Institute Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the future Faculty of Psychology of the University of Geneva, where he was appointed as a professor. Switzerland also allowed him to get closer to Romain Rolland. Baudouin had his first analysis with Dr. Carl Picht, a Jungian. After meeting with Sigmund Freud in Vienna in 1926, he began a second \\"didactic\\" analysis, from 1926 to 1928, with Dr. Charles Odier, a Freudian of the time. A few years later, he followed up with a new analytical experience with Tina Keller. He did not neglect the historical foundations of psychoanalysis, particularly suggestion and hypnosis. This experience and all his therapeutic practice, including the therapy of children and education led him to express the respective contributions of Freud and Jung with his own findings. \\"Freud or Jung’s alternatives must be overcome, we must be in favor of psychoanalysis,\\" he said and added, \\"It's like asking you: Are you for Newton or Einstein? To which there is only one answer: I am for physics\\". He brought to psychoanalytic structure his personal contribution, reaching the conclusion of \\"De l'instinct à l'esprit.\\" He also wrote the interesting term \\"Psychagogy\\" . In 1924 he founded the International Institute of Psychagogy and Psychotherapy under the patronage of Adler, Allendy, Bachelard, Coue, Flournoy, Freud, Hesnard, Janet, Jung, Laforgue, etc. Later the Institute was renamed in to International Institute for Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy Charles Baudouin, headquartered in Geneva. He published a pacifist journal, Le Carmel, published various articles mainly from 1933 to 1935 and, alternately, as of 1917 a monthly magazine Les Cahiers du Carmel. When these journals ceased publication, Baudouin replaced them with the Bulletin trimestriel de l’Institut international de psychagogie, which became in 1931 the Action et Pensée magazine. This is still published twice a year. International Institute for Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy Charles Baudouin The Institute was officially founded in Geneva in 1924 by Charles Baudouin as the \\"Institute of Psychagogy and Psychotherapy\\". Its patronage committee over time included, Adler, Allendy, Bachelard Besse, Coué, Driesch, Durand, Eliade, Flournoy, Flugel, Freud, Guitton, Hesnard, Huyghe, Janet, Jung, Laforgue, Maeder and Meng. The first directors were Baudouin, Bovet and Claparède. It is the oldest French institute of psychoanalysis. The institute today has over a hundred practitioners in Europe and is represented in four countries: Belgium, France, Italy and Switzerland. It pursues a constant research on the theoretical and practical side, organizes conferences, seminars and symposiums open to the public and is always eager to train new members in the spirit of openness, which characterized its practice. Theoretical concepts of the founders Baudouin supports his methodology on three levels (the Psychagogy), depending on the degree of contribution of the unconscious. It therefore has three kinds of methods used separately, sequentially or simultaneously as appropriate: = From the Conscious to the Conscious: \\"The educational methods\\"Baudouin Ch., La Force en nous, Nancy-Genève, Ed. de la Société lorraine de Psychologie Appliqué – Ed. du Carmel, 1923, 1950Baudouin Ch., Mobilisation de l’énergie.

Imago, 2007. = Baudouin based the psychoanalytic synthesis primarily on Freudian, Jungian and Adlerian based concepts, plus his own, clearing the vibrant and dynamic complementarity. Baudouin brings together in one representation the scheme of \\"the seven partners of the Ego\\", including: * Three Freudian instances, Es, Ego and Super-ego, * Three Jungian instances, Persona, Shadow and Self, * One Baudouinienne instance, the Automatism. Of their oppositions, agreements or complementarity, the always shifting balance of the psychic system will depend. Works Through his numerous books and conferences, Baudouin promoted psychoanalysis not only in French-speaking countries but around the world. His work merits greater attention from modern historians and psychoanalysts. His concerns and fields of interest are often directly relevant to contemporary psychoanalysis. He is a precursor in a number of fields (art, education, suggestion, and hypnosis) and some books have been translated in German, English, Spanish, Italian, Norwegian and Swedish. A valuable collection of his essays, Contemporary Studies (1925) includes \\"The Linguistic International (Esperanto).\\" His speech in Esperanto given during the 'somera universitato' as part of an international Esperanto Congress in Geneva (1925), was published under the title La arto de memdisciplino. = Some books in English = * Suggestion and autosuggestion : a psychological and pedagogical study based upon the investigations made by the new Nancy school.

It provides for the most extensive reorganisation of the structure of the National Health Service in England to date.BMJ, 2011; 342:d408, Dr Lansley’s Monster It removed responsibility for the health of citizens from the Secretary of State for Health, which the post had carried since the inception of the NHS in 1948. It abolished primary care trusts (PCTs) and strategic health authorities (SHAs) and transferred between £60 billion and £80 billion of \\"commissioning\\", or healthcare funds, from the abolished PCTs to several hundred clinical commissioning groups, partly run by the general practitioners (GPs) in England but also a major point of access for private service providers. A new executive agency of the Department of Health, Public Health England, was established under the Act on 1 April 2013. The proposals are primarily the result of policies of the then Secretary of State for Health, Andrew Lansley. Writing in the BMJ, Clive Peedell (co- chairman of the NHS Consultants Association and a consultant clinical oncologist) compared the policies with academic analyses of privatisation and found \\"evidence that privatisation is an inevitable consequence of many of the policies contained in the Health and Social Care Bill\\".Clive Peedell, BMJ, 17 May 2011, Further privatisation is inevitable under the proposed NHS reforms, BMJ 2011; 342:d2996 Lansley said that claims that the government is attempting to privatise the NHS are \\"ludicrous scaremongering\\". The proposals contained in the Act are some of the coalition government's most controversial. Although mentioned in the Conservative Party's manifesto in 2010, they were not discussed during the general election campaign that year and were not contained in the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement, which mentioned the NHS only to commit the coalition to a real-term funding increase every year. Within two months of the election a white paper was published, outlining what the Daily Telegraph called the \\"biggest revolution in the NHS since its foundation\\".Daily Telegraph, 9 July 2010, Biggest revolution in the NHS for 60 years The bill was introduced in the House of Commons on 19 January 2011.http://www.parliament.uk, Bill stages – Health and Social Care Bill 2010-11http://www.parliament.uk, Health and Social Care Bill - text of bill as introduced on 19 January 2011. In April 2011 the government announced a \\"listening exercise\\", halting the Bill's legislative progress until after the May local elections; the \\"listening exercise\\" finished by the end of that month. The Bill received Royal Assent on 27 March 2012. Background The proposals in the Act were not discussed during the general election campaign in 2010 and were not contained in the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement of 20 May 2010, which declared an intention to \\"stop the top-down reorganisations of the NHS that have got in the way of patient care\\". However, within two months a white paper outlined what the Daily Telegraph called the \\"biggest revolution in the NHS since its foundation\\". The white paper, Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS, was followed in December 2010 by an implementation plan in the form of Liberating the NHS: legislative framework and next steps.Department of Health, Health and Social Care Bill 2011 McKinsey & Company who have been influential in the British Department of Health for many years was heavily involved in the discussions around the Bill. The bill was introduced into the House of Commons on 19 January 2011 and received its second reading, a vote to approve the general principles of the Bill, by 321–235, a majority of 86, on 31 January 2011.Hansard, HC Deb 31 Jan 2011, cols 700-704 =White Paper= The Act had implications for the entire NHS. Primary care trusts (PCTs) and strategic health authorities (SHAs) were abolished, with projected redundancy costs of £1 billion for around 21,000 staff.guardian.co.uk, 19 January 2011, Health and social care bill based on 20,900 NHS redundancies £60 to £80 billion worth of commissioning will be transferred from PCTs to several hundred clinical commissioning groups, partly run by GPs. Around 3,600 facilities owned by PCTs and SHAs would transfer to NHS Property Services, a limited company owned by the Department of Health. When the white paper was presented to Parliament, the Secretary of State for Health, Andrew Lansley, told MPs of three key principles: *patients at the centre of the NHS *changing the emphasis of measurement to clinical outcomes *empowering health professionals, in particular GPs. The white paper set out the following timetable. By April 2012 it proposed to: *establish the independent NHS Commissioning Board *establish new local authority health and well-being boards *develop Monitor as an economic regulator. The Bill foresaw all NHS trusts becoming, or being amalgamated into, foundation trusts. The Bill also abolished the existing cap on trusts' income from non-NHS sources, which in most cases was previously set at a relatively low single-digit percentage. Under the Bill's provisions the new commissioning system would be expected to be in place by April 2013, by which time SHAs and PCTs would be abolished. The Bill was analysed by Stephen Cragg of Doughty Street Chambers, on behalf of the 38 Degrees campaign, who concluded that \\"Effectively, the duty to provide a national health service would be lost if the Bill becomes law, and would be replaced by a duty on an unknown number of commissioning consortia with only a duty to make or arrange provision for that section of the population for which it is responsible.\\" It replaces a \\"duty to provide\\" with a \\"duty to promote\\".38degrees.org.uk, 30 August 2011, NHS LEGAL REVIEW ON DUTY TO PROVIDE =\\"Listening exercise\\"= After an increase in opposition pressure, including from both rank-and-file Liberal Democrats and the British Medical Association, the government announced a \\"listening exercise\\" with critics.BBC, 6 April 2011, PM seeks to allay fears, but insists change is needed On 4 April 2011 the government announced a \\"pause\\" in the progress of the Bill to allow the government to 'listen, reflect and improve' the proposals.Coalition to 'pause, listen and reflect' on NHS reform ePolitix.com, published 2011-04-06, accessed 2011-04-06Government to \\"pause, listen, reflect and improve\\" NHS reform plans guardian.co.uk, published 2011-04-06, accessed 2011-04-06 The Prime Minister, David Cameron, said \\"the status quo is not an option\\" and many within his and Nick Clegg's coalition said that certain aspects of the Bill, such as the formation of Clinical commissioning groups, were not only not open for discussion, but also already too far along the path to completion to be stopped.The Independent, 7 April 2011, Minister: tell us your fears about NHS reforms – but we might not listen Cameron insisted that the Act was part of his \\"Big Society\\" agenda and that it would not alter the fundamental principles of the NHS. Part of the \\"listening exercise\\" saw the creation on 6 April 2011 of the \\"NHS Future Forum\\".Department of Health, 6 April 2011, NHS Future Forum to provide channel for patient and staff opinion The Forum, according to Private Eye, \\"brings together 43 hand-picked individuals, many of whom are known as supporters of Lansley's approach\\".Private Eye, Issue 1288, \\"Is anybody listening?\\", p30 At the same time, David Cameron set up a separate panel to advise him on the reforms; members of this panel include Lord Crisp (NHS chief executive 2000-2006), Bill Moyes (a former head of Monitor), and the head of global health systems at McKinsey,Nursing Times, 3 May 2011, Expert panel to advise prime minister on NHS as well as Mark Britnell, the head of health policy at KPMG. Six months previously Britnell had told a conference of private healthcare executives that \\"In future, the NHS will be a state insurance provider not a state deliverer,\\" and emphasised the role of Lansley's reforms in making this possible: \\"The NHS will be shown no mercy and the best time to take advantage of this will be in the next couple of years.\\"The Observer, 15 May 2011, David Cameron's adviser says health reform is a chance to make big profitsSpinwatch, 9 May 2011, \\"The NHS will be shown no mercy\\" says Cameron health adviser KPMG issued a press statement on behalf of Britnell on 16 May 2011 stating > \\"The article in The Observer attributes quotes to me that do not properly > reflect discussions held at a private conference last October.

Like many other > countries throughout the world, the pressure facing healthcare funding and > provision are enormous. If the NHS is to change and modernise the public, > private and voluntary sectors will all need to play their part.\\" In June 2011 Cameron announced that the original deadline of 2013 would no longer be part of the reforms. There would also be changes to the Bill to make clear that the main duty of the health regulator, Monitor, will be to promote the interests of patients rather than promoting competition. The Future Forum report suggested that any organisation that treats NHS patients, including independent hospitals, should be forced to hold meetings in public and publish minutes. It also wants the establishment of a Citizens' Panel to report on how easy it is to choose services, while patients would be given a right to challenge poor treatment. The original Bill sought to abolish two tiers of management and hand power to new bodies led by GPs, called commissioning consortia, to buy £60 billion a year in treatment. Professor Steve Field, a GP who chaired the forum, said many of the fears the public and medical profession had about the Health and Social Care Bill had been \\"justified\\" as it contained \\"insufficient safeguards\\" against private companies exploiting the NHS. =Amendments= Following the completion of the listening exercise, the Bill was recommitted to a public bill committee on 21 June 2011. On 7 September, the Bill passed the House of Commons and received its third reading by 316–251. On 12 October 2011, the Bill was approved in principle at second reading in the House of Lords by 354–220.HL Deb 12 October 2011, cols 1711-1715 An amendment moved by Lord Owen to commit the most controversial clauses of the Bill to a select committee was defeated by 330–262.Ibid, cols 1719-1723 The Bill was subsequently committed to a committee of the whole House for detailed scrutiny. The committee stage was completed on 21 December 2011, and the Bill was passed by the Lords, with amendments, on 19 March 2012. The Commons agreed to all Lords amendments to the Bill on 20 March 2012. The Bill received Royal Assent and became the Health and Social Care Act 2012 on 27 March 2012.Media Centre, \\"Health and Social Care Bill gains royal assent\\", Department of Health, (27 March 2012) Contents =Parts 1 and 2 Health service in England= Section 9 establishes the National Health Service Commissioning Board, which is now known as NHS England. The Secretary of State is to publish, annually, a document known as the mandate which specifies the objectives which the Board should seek to achieve. National Health Service (Mandate Requirements) Regulations are published each year to give legal force to the mandate. Section 10 establishes Clinical Commissioning Groups which are to arrange the provision of health services in each local area. Section 11 makes the protection of public health a duty of the Secretary of State, and section 12 makes local authorities responsible for improving the health of the people in their areas. Among the effects of this, local authorities regained the commissioning of community services such as those for sexual health and substance misuse. Section 30 requires each local authority to appoint a director of public health, and gives the Secretary of State certain powers over that person's appointment. =Part 3 Regulation of health and adult social care services= =Part 4 NHS foundation trusts & NHS trusts= =Part 5 Public involvement and local government= Sections 181 to 189 establish Healthwatch England, responsible for gathering and championing the views of users of health and social care services in order to identify improvements and influence providers' plans. Sections 194 to 199 establish Health and wellbeing boards in each upper-tier local authority, in order to encourage providers of health and social care to work in an integrated manner. =Part 6 Primary care services= =Part 7 Regulation of health and social care workers= =Part 8, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence= Sections 232 to 249 expand the role of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to include social care, re-establishing the body on 1 April 2013 as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (known as NICE). This non-departmental public body publishes guidance in areas such as the use of new and existing medicines, treatments and procedures, taking into account cost-effectiveness; its scope is NHS services, public health services, and (in England only) social care. =Part 9, Health and adult social care services: information= =Part 10, Abolition of public bodies= Sections 278 to 283 abolished the Alcohol Education and Research Council, the Appointments Commission, the National Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care, the National Patient Safety Agency, the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement and the standing advisory committees. =Parts 11 and 12, Miscellaneous= Sections 284 to 309 contained various other provisions. Public reactions =General= On 19 January 2012 two major unions of healthcare professionals that had previously tried to work with the government on the bill, the Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Midwives, decided instead to join with the British Medical Association in \\"outright opposition\\" to the bill. On 3 February 2012 the Royal College of General Practitioners also called on the Prime Minister to withdraw the bill. The Confederation of British Industry supported the bill, declaring that \\"Allowing the best provider to deliver healthcare services, whether they are a private company or a charity, will spur innovation and choice.\\" In May 2011, a number of doctors from GP consortia wrote a letter to the Daily Telegraph in which they expressed their support for the bill, calling its plans \\"a natural conclusion of the GP commissioning role that began with fundholding in the 1990s and, more recently, of the previous government's agenda of GP polysystems and practice-based commissioning\\". On 14 May 2011, The Guardian published an article reporting that the GP appointed to head the NHS \\"listening exercise\\" has unilaterally condemned the bill. The article said that Steve Field had \\"dismissed\\" the plans \\"as unworkable\\" and that these statements were \\"provisional conclusions that could fatally undermine the plans\\". The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) also denounced the bill. The Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of Surgeons welcomed in principle the idea of medical professionals determining the direction of NHS services, but questioned the Bill's implementation of the principle, particularly in regard to the approach of making GP consortia the primary commissioning deciders, and also in regard to requiring competition. The British Medical Association said similarly. Neither of these organisations supported the bill. In February 2011 David Bennett, newly appointed Chair of Monitor, said the NHS could become like other privatised utilities, so that Monitor would potentially be a regulator like Ofcom, Ofgem and Ofwat: \\"We, in the UK, have done this in other sectors before. We did it in gas, we did it in power, we did it in telecoms […] We've done it in rail, we've done it in water, so there's actually 20 years of experience in taking monopolistic, monolithic markets and providers and exposing them to economic regulation.\\"The Times, 25 February 2011, \\"NHS reforms raise prospect of Tesco-style hospital chains\\" The House of Commons Select Committee on Health condemned the comparison as not \\"accurate or helpful.\\"House of Commons Select Committee on Health, 31 March 2011, Health Committee - Fifth Report. Commissioning: further issues =GPs as commissioners= The bill intended to make general practitioners the direct overseers of NHS funds, rather than having those funds channelled through neighbourhood- and region-based primary care trusts, as was previously done.BBC, 9 July 2010, NHS shake-up 'hands funding powers to GPs' There are concerns about fragmentation of the NHS and a loss of coordination and planning. The Royal College of General Practitioners said it was \\"concerned that some of the types of choice outlined in the government’s proposals run a risk of destabilising the NHS and causing long-term harm to patient outcomes, particularly in cases of children with disabilities, those with multiple comorbidities and the frail and elderly.\\" Similarly, the Royal College of Physicians said that \\"Whilst we welcome the broad provision in the bill to seek professional expertise, the RCP is concerned that the bill does not require that specialists are at the heart of the commissioning process.\\" The Royal College of Psychiatrists said it \\"would be dismayed if psychiatrists were not closely involved with local consortia of GPs in the development of mental health services.\\" The Royal College of Surgeons said that \\"the legislation leaves the question of regional level commissioning unanswered with no intermediary structure put in place.\\" And there are concerns about management expertise, particularly by looking at the US. The BMJ wrote that The House of Commons health committee has suggested the government let experts other than the consortia GPs and their direct allies get involved in the running of the consortia, including hospital doctors, public health chiefs, social care staff, and councillors. That idea has received some wider support and the government has agreed to give it consideration. Those close to Health Secretary Andrew Lansley have said, however, that Lansley is concerned adding too many people to consortia decision-making risks making the consortia too unwieldy.\\"BBC, 5 April 2011, NHS changes: Points of contention, accessed 21 April 2011 In 2010 the same committee had gone so far as to declare that \\"if reliable figures for the costs of commissioning prove that it is uneconomic and if it does not begin to improve soon, after 20 years of costly failure, the purchaser/provider split may need to be abolished.\\"House of Commons Health Committee. Fourth report of session 2009-10. Commissioning.2010. www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmhealth/268/268i.pdf =Accountability= Kieran Walshe, professor of health policy and management and Chris Ham, chief executive of the King's Fund, have argued that \\"At a national level, it is difficult to see who, if anyone, will be in charge of the NHS. There will be five key national bodies: the Department of Health, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, the Care Quality Commission, the NHS Commissioning Board, and the economic regulator Monitor. Although the remit of each is set out in legislation, it is not clear how these national bodies will interact or how they will provide coordinated and consistent governance of the NHS.\\"Kieran Walshe and Chris Ham (2011), Can the government’s proposals for NHS reform be made to work?, BMJ 2011; 342:d2038 Clinical commissioning groups will operate as statutory bodies, though it has been suggested that up to third of CCGs are reluctant to do so. =Pace and timing of change= The King's Fund said that \\"the very real risk that the speed and scale of the reforms could destabilise the NHS and undermine care must be actively managed.\\"BMJ (2011), Reaction: what they say about the health bill, BMJ 2011; 342:d413 The BMJ said in January 2011 that \\"The bill promises that all general practices will be part of consortiums by April 2012, yet it took six years for 56% of general practices to become fundholders after the introduction of the internal market. Nearly seven years after the first NHS trust was granted foundation status, there are still more than half to go—within two years. And there’s more. The replacement for the 10 strategic health authorities—the NHS Commissioning Board—needs to be fully operational by next April. By then, GP consortiums should have developed relationships with local authorities, which will assume ultimate responsibility for public health via their new health and wellbeing boards, working alongside Public Health England, a completely new entity.\\" The BMA believes such targets to be either wholly impossible or, at best, able to be done only in a very roughshod manner, which could in turn have very serious on-the-ground consequences to NHS functioning. =Medical establishment reaction= The British Medical Association opposes the bill,British Medical Association, Health and Social Care Bill - lobbying toolkit and held its first emergency meeting in 19 years,Sky News, 15 March 2011, BMA Rejects Health Sec 'No Confidence' Vote which asked the government to withdraw the bill and reconsider the reforms, although a motion of no confidence in Andrew Lansley by the BMA failed. A later motion of no confidence in Lansley by attendees at the Royal College of Nursing Conference in 2011, however, succeeded, with 96% voting in favour of the motion, and several speeches thereafter condemning Lansley threefold: the Health and Social Care Bill 2011 as-written; Lansley's decision not to address the entire Conference with a speech, but instead to hold a separate meeting with 40 Conference attendees in a separate space (taken as an insult to nurses, and leading to accusations of 'gutlessness'); and the current separate \\"efficiency savings\\" measures being undertaken across the NHS and those actions' material impact on frontline medical services, especially as contrasted with several prominent officials, including NHS leaders and Lansley himself, repeatedly assuring that NHS frontline services are 'protected' at all times regardless of these \\"savings\\" measures.BBC, 13 April 2011, Lansley sorry as nurses pass 'no confidence' voteBBC, 11 April 2011, NHS reform: Front-line clinical jobs 'under threat' \\"People will die\\", Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet, warned in March 2012, as he predicted \\"unprecedented chaos\\" as a result of the reforms, with a leaked draft risk-assessment claiming that emergencies could be less well managed and the increased use of the private sector could drive up costs. =Opposition groups= A panorama of the 'Block the Bridge' anti-cuts protest on Westminster Bridge, in October 2011 Various pressure groups opposed the bill, including The People's Assembly, NHS Direct Action, Keep Our NHS Public, 38 Degrees,38 DegreesSave the NHS: Sign The Petition , accessed 21 April 2011 the Socialist Health Association, many Trades unions, including the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, UNISON, and Unite.Unite, Unite 4 our NHS 38 Degrees' petition against the reforms passed 250,000 signatures by 21 April 2011.

He has previously co-authored a book calling for the NHS to be dismantled and replaced with a system of personal health accounts. The deputy chairman of the British Medical Association, Dr Kailash Chand, said \\"Jeremy Hunt is new Health Secretary – disaster in the NHS carries on. I fear a more toxic right winger to follow the privatisation agenda.\\" On 9 October 2011, a protest organised by UK Uncut took place on Westminster Bridge. an estimated 2,000 health workers and activists attended the protest. On 5 March 2012, the campaign group 38 Degrees erected 130 billboards in the centre of London with the aim of persuading David Cameron to abandon the bill. On 25 September 2013 Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham promised that the party will repeal the Health and Social Care Act in \\"the first Queen's Speech\\" if elected. Effect of the Act In January 2015 Chris Ham and others from the King's Fund produced a review of the government's health reforms. Their conclusions as far as the Act was concerned were that: * The reforms resulted in greater marketisation of the NHS but claims of mass privatisation are exaggerated * The reforms resulted in top-down reorganisation of the NHS which was distracting and damaging * New systems of governance and accountability are complex and confusing * The absence of system leadership is increasingly problematic when the NHS needs to undertake major service changes In November 2017 Jeremy Hunt in an interview with the Health Service Journal said \\"The idea of lots of competing foundation trusts and payment by results works well when you have in your mind that most of the work the NHS does will be single episode elective care, but when you’re dealing with complex patients who are going in and out of the system a lot those structures prove not to be fit for purpose.\\" Nick Timmins, writing in 2018, concluded that the legislation, in its own terms, had failed. Choice and competition were not, as envisaged, the driving principles of the NHS. In fact the development of integrated care systems was unpicking the \\"purchaser/provider\\" split that had been the dominant theme of NHS management since 1991. The organisations set up by the Act, Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority had effectively been merged. And there was nothing to suggest that \\"political micro-management\\" and \\"excessive bureaucratic and political control\\" had disappeared. But, he said the Act had given the NHS an independent voice, and that according to Jeremy Hunt \\"the independence of NHS England is the bit that has worked best\\". David Benbow has argued that the legislation did not extend patient choice as envisaged (as this policy subsequently took a backseat) but that it did lead to an increasing amount of the NHS budget being diverted to private providers. The publication of the NHS Long Term Plan in January 2019 marked the official abandonment of the policy of competition in the English NHS, with integrated care systems to be created across England by 2021, mergers of Clinical Commissioning Groups and probable merging of NHS England with NHS Improvement, though this was all to happen without actually repealing the legislation. In February 2019 NHS England produced a document outlining changes it wanted to see in legislation. One of the central proposals was to remove the obligation to put services out to competitive tender if local commissioners considered a service would be best provided from within the NHS.

The palace had two stages for performances of Noh: the omote-butai, or front stage, and oku-butai, the rear stage. Noh was performed to commemorate a lord's succession to a fiefdom and to celebrate the birth of an heir. The Owari branch of the ruling Tokugawa clan were patrons of many Noh actors.

Ashigara was transporting Japanese troops from Indonesia for the defence of Singapore, and the sinking resulted in a heavy loss of life. Background Ashigara departed Batavia (present-day Jakarta) on 7 June 1945 for Singapore with 1,600 troops and 480 tons of supplies on board to reinforce the defence of that city.Wise p 202 She was escorted by the destroyer , which had survived the Japanese defeat in the Malacca Strait. Their planned route was north from Batavia, then NNW through the Bangka Strait between Sumatra and Bangka Island, then north to Singapore. The U.S. Navy submarine USS Blueback observed their departure but was unable to maneuver into an attack position. Bluebacks contact report was passed on to HMS Trenchant, under the command of Cdr Arthur Hezlet. In company with the submarine (Lt G. C. Clarabut), Trenchant took up position on the northern approaches of Bangka Strait - Trenchant just inside the strait, south of Hendrik Klippen Shoal, while Stygian patrolled north of the shoal. Both submarines were on the surface. To get into position, Trenchant had to negotiate a minefield laid earlier by the Royal Netherlands Navy submarine HNLMS O 19. The action On 8 June 1945 at 0423, Kamikaze was spotted by Trenchant, which in turn was spotted by the Japanese destroyer at 0436. Kamikaze began firing her guns at Trenchant, and the submarine fired a single torpedo from her stern tubes; however, both ships missed each other and also lost contact. Trenchant immediately sent a contact report to Stygian, reporting that she had been detected by the destroyer, then changed position to east of the shoal and dived at 0702. Hezlet spotted Kamikaze again at 0955 heading north, but disappearing from sight at 1030. Jolly Roger after sinking Ashigara Stygian saw star shells fired by Kamikaze at 0439 during the short engagement with Trenchant, and also received the contact report. She remained north of the shoal, judging correctly that Trenchant was clear of the enemy, since there was no further gunfire, and no depth charge detonations had been heard, then dived at 0722. At 1015 she spotted Kamikaze heading north, along with patrolling Japanese aircraft. At 1050, after Kamikaze changed course back to the south, Stygian fired two torpedoes at her at a range of , but the destroyer spotted the torpedo tracks and took evasive action, causing both torpedoes to miss. Kamikaze counterattacked the submarine with depth charges, causing minor damage to Stygian, but then lost contact, with depth-charge explosions becoming more and more distant. Aboard Trenchant, Hezlet now spotted the masts and upper works of Ashigara through his periscope at 1148, bearing 177 degrees at a range of , heading northwest on a course of 330 degrees at a speed of . Trenchant did not close the range, assuming that Ashigara would come closer to her by taking the more open water east of the shoal (closer to Bangka Island), but instead the heavy cruiser chose to pass through the very restricted water west of the shoal, closer to the Sumatra coast. It soon became clear to Hezlet that he could not reach a firing position closer to Ashigara than , almost at the maximum range of his torpedoes.Compton-Hall pg 112 At such a distance, Hezlet had to quickly make precise calculations before his chance of an attack disappeared. At 1209 Trenchant fired a full bow salvo of eight torpedoes from abaft the cruiser's starboard beam at a range of aimed individually from a quarter of length ahead to a quarter of a length astern. Because of the Sumatran shoreline to port Ashigara could only change course to starboard 20 degrees and increased speed to in an attempt to comb the torpedo tracks. However, this was not enough to evade the attack, and after three minutes five torpedoes struck Ashigara on the starboard side, causing severe damage and setting her on fire. Trenchants company queued to view through the search periscope, but the periscope attracted fire from Ashigaras anti-aircraft guns. Hezlet then turned Trenchant to bring her stern tubes to bear and fired two more torpedoes at 1224, but missed. Torpedoes fired by Ashigara at Trenchants periscope missed, but a fire caused by the first hits had spread rapidly through Ashigara causing a huge pall of smoke to obscure Hezlet's view. Kamikaze had returned to the area and dropped three patterns of depth charges, but these were no closer than from Trenchant. Ashigara capsized to starboard at 1239, and Kamikaze picked up survivors, assisted by two local vessels. Trenchant remained submerged and escaped to the north of Bangka Strait, returning to Subic Bay, Philippines on 20 June 1945, followed by Stygian on 27 June 1945. Aftermath Losses in the sinking were heavy; out of 1,600 troops, only 400 were saved, while 850 of her crew were rescued, including Captain Miura. Ashigara had been the last remaining major Japanese warship in the area after the cruiser was sunk the previous month by British destroyers. After her sinking, the 10th Area Fleet based out of Singapore was left with Kamikaze as its only significant surface ship.Jackson p 302 The sinking of Ashigara earned Hezlet a bar to his DSO and the U.S. Legion of Merit. HMS Trenchant flew the Jolly Roger as a tribute to her success when she reached her base at Trincomalee. Tactically it was one of the most brilliant submarine attacks of the war in terms of range.

Following the 2015 and 2019 Gibraltar General Elections, Picardo was re-elected to two further four-year terms by the people of Gibraltar.  Early life and education  Picardo was born on 18 February 1972 in Gibraltar and grew up in the Upper Town area. He has said that the area where he grew up \\"always made me think about the huge potential that the bay of Gibraltar could have as long as we were able to work together with our Spanish neighbours.\\" His father was a clerical worker for the Ministry of Defence on Gibraltar, and his mother was a personal assistant to Joshua Hassan, the founder of Hassans law firm and a Chief Minister of Gibraltar. Picardo has said that \\"My parents instilled in me the simple principle of equality, that nobody is better than anybody else and that we shouldn’t look down on absolutely anyone because all of us are created equal.\\" Picardo's grandmother was Spanish, although he has said that the Picardo line came to Gibraltar during the Napoleonic Wars and that he's \\"particularly proud of that part of [his] bloodline.\\" Picardo first entertained the idea of becoming a lawyer as the \\"result of a discussion with a teacher, who I was particularly keen to argue with, who told me that if I wanted to argue I should charge people for it and become a lawyer.\\" He visited Hassans law firm when he was 14-years-old to discuss the idea with the lawyers. From 1990 to 1993, Picardo studied jurisprudence at Oriel College, Oxford. His studies were supported by the grant system introduced by Joe Bossano's Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party government in 1988. Oriel College paid tribute to Picardo's election by flying the flag of Gibraltar, and Picardo has also spoken at Oriel Law Society since his election. Picardo then studied at the Inns of Court School of Gray's Inn and was called to the bar by Middle Temple in 1994.  Legal career  In September 1994, Picardo joined Hassans, the largest law firm in Gibraltar, as an associate. He became a partner in 2000. He was appointed as a Queen's Counsel on 12 June 2014.  Political career  Picardo was a co-founder of the Gibraltar National Party in 1991, the predecessor to the Liberal Party of Gibraltar. In 2003, he joined the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party (GSLP) and was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the GSLP in that year's general election. Picardo has described what made him interested in politics as a lawyer in Gibraltar: \\"I started to wake up to politics and see what Hassan had done, and I started to understand what Joe Bossano was doing. I realised that if I had the ability to become a lawyer then I should use that ability also in the interests of Gibraltar. Gibraltar is a place where all of us have to pull our weight; we all have to do what we can and I wanted to do what I could in politics.\\" Picardo became the leader of the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party in 2011, taking over from Joe Bossano. He won the 2011 election, forming a coalition government with the Liberal Party. Picardo said that the \\"crowning achievements\\" of his first term were two new schools, a university, a new bank, and a new 700-berth marina. He also appointed Gibraltar's first Minister for Equalities and passed the Civil Partnerships Act in 2014, ending legal discrimination against same-sex couples. In October 2015, he said that if Brexit took place, Gibraltar \\"would have to carefully reconsider what the economic prospects for Gibraltar are and how we would be positioned.\\"  Personal life  Picardo is married to Justine Olivero, who works for Hassans law firm, and they have two sons and one daughter, Sebastian, Oliver and Valentina.

Early life and education Marks' family came from Yugoslavia with the surname Mrakovich, but his parents changed to the name Marks three months before he was born. Growing up in Detroit, Marks studied classical piano and learned to play guitar at age 13. He graduated from Messiah College in Philadelphia in 1971. Career Marks began performing for Billy Graham's Afterglow Concert Series. In 1981 he participated in a project called \\"Premiere Performance\\" by Myrrh Records, an album with songs by various artists and an invitation for buyers to vote for their favorite who would then be offered a full contract with the Christian recording label. Marks' was the fans choice. Marks' first album Follow Him was released on Myrrh Records in 1982. With his second album, 1984's Right Where You Are, he began to find his own definitive style as an artist and fulfil his desire to sing about relationships. In the 1990s, Marks became a host on the Nashville based Shop at Home TV Network. Music Jeannie and Johnny, a fictitious Franklin High School couple created by Marks, appear on his albums Attitude (1985) and Make It Right (1987). In the song, \\"Growing Up Too Fast\\" they are two individual kids dealing separately with emotions and impulses. In \\"The Party's Over, they meet at a party and get together in the back seat of Johnny's car, resulting in a pregnancy that robs them of their carefree teenage lifestyle. On the album Another Friday Night, with the song, \\"Next Time You See Johnny\\", Johnny has left Jeannie with their son, who is who's old enough to hurt over Daddy's leaving, and innocent enough to hold forgiveness in his heart for Johnny. \\"Fire of Forgiveness\\" is the fourth and final song, a reflection of Johnny looking back on his life. He also sang \\"Friends\\", which serves as the theme song for the dramatic segment on the series Fire by Nite called \\"Friends\\". The song \\"Say a Prayer for Me Tonight\\" reflects on a true story when a young man named Richard talked to Marks after a concert in Philadelphia on his Make It Right tour and asked Marks to pray for him and then shared some songs he had written. Three weeks later, Marks learned that Richard had committed suicide. \\"White Dress\\", which began as a song for Marks' daughter Allegra on her first birthday, tells the story of a girl growing up, abandoned by her father, and then becoming a mother herself. Personal life Marks was married to Pamela Marks, who co-wrote some of his songs, for twenty-four years. They divorced in 1997. Marks died of a heart attack on October 31, 2018.

Goodwin State Forest and Natchaug State Forest as well as the much smaller Nathaniel Lyons Memorial Park. Camping permits may be obtained by backpackers for both state forests. In addition to the Nipmuck Trail there are several smaller hiking trails which connect to the Natchaug Trail as well as several park and forest roads and the multi-use Airline State Park Linear Trail. In Natchaug State Forest the CCC Trail is a historic loop trail which was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression in the 1930s. Two of the several trails inside the James L. Goodwin State Forest are connected to the Natchaug Trail have recently been blazed as official CFPA trails. According to signs at the James L. Goodwin State Forest the White Trail is being (or has been) re-blazed as a blue-white trail named the \\"Pine Acres Lake View Trail\\". A CFPA blue-orange blazed trail also intersects with the Natchaug Trail during the stretch between Pine Acres Lake and Black Spruce Pond. Description The Natchaug Trail is primarily used for hiking, backpacking, picnicking, and in the winter, snowshoeing. Portions of the trail are suitable for, and are used for, cross-country skiing and geocaching. Site-specific activities enjoyed along the route include bird watching, hunting (very limited), fishing, horseback riding, bouldering and rock climbing (limited). =Route= The northern end of the Natchaug Trail connects with the Nipmuck Trail 1200 feet south of Eastford Road in Ashford, Connecticut in northern Natchaug State Forest. After crossing the unpaved Moon Road, the northern third of the trail generally parallels Bigelow Brook until it merges with the Stones and Stills brooks to become the Natchaug River. For most of the southern two thirds of the trail's length it follows both Connecticut Route 198 and the Natchaug River through the Natchaug and James L. Goodwin State Forests to the southern end at the James L. Goodwin Conservation Center at the southern end of Pine Acres Lake. =Trail communities= The official Blue-Blazed Natchaug Trail passes through land located within the following municipalities, from south to north: Hampton, Connecticut, Chaplin, Connecticut, Ashford, Connecticut, Eastford, Connecticut Landscape, geology, and natural environment History and folklore The Blue-Blazed Natchaug Trail was created by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association. As it did not appear in the 1969 version of the CFPA Connecticut Walk Book and it appears in the 1973 version it would appear to have been created during the 1969-1973 period. =Origin and name= Natchaug is a Nipmuc Native American word meaning \\"land between the rivers\\".List of place names in New England of aboriginal origin The name Natchaug is used as a geographical place name throughout Eastern Connecticut and particularly in Tolland and Windham counties in Northeastern Connecticut. It was not the name of a native American tribe or group, but of a particular area in Connecticut. Today the name Natchaug appears as the name of a trail, river, elementary school, hospital and state forest. =Historic sites= General Nathaniel Lyon gravesite with monument and cannon in Eastford, CT. The Natchaug state forest occupies a portion of the former hunting grounds of the Wabbaquasset Indians between the Bigelow and Still Rivers. The James L. Goodwin State Forest is named for, and occupies land donated by its namesake. James L. Goodwin was one of the first Yale University School of Forestry graduates and began using modern forest management practices in the northeastern part of Connecticut.James L. Goodwin State Forest He also created and donated the James L. Goodwin Conservation Center to the state to educate the people of Connecticut regarding \\"general, wildlife and forest conservation.\\" There are two memorials to Nathaniel Lyon, the first Union general to die in the US Civil War along the Natchaug Trail. Nathaniel Lyon Memorial State Park contains the birthplace of General Lyon, although only the very large fireplace remains. General Nathaniel Lyon Memorial in General Lyon Cemetery (established 1805) is located in the Phoenixville section of Eastford just north of the northern end of a portion of General Lyon Road overlaps with the Natchaug Trail. =Folklore= There are remains of foundations for stone houses, dams and cisterns along both the Natchaug Trail and CCC side trail. There are several letterboxes cached along both trails including two official State of Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) letterboxes. One is in Natchaug State Forest on the CCC Trail Natchaug State Forest DEP Letterbox and the other is in the James L. Goodwin State Forest near Pine Acres Lake James L. Goodwin State Forest DEP Letterbox close by a three-sided cellar hole where the local legend says that the smell of wood smoke can often still be detected on cold January nights from a long gone chimney. There is a trail register notebook in a can affixed to the northern end of a foot bridge over Stones Brook on the Natchaug Trail approximately 0.6 mile south of Connecticut Route 44. Hiking The mainline trail is blazed with blue rectangles. Trail descriptions are available from a number of commercial and non-commercial sources, and a complete guidebook is published by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association It is regularly maintained, and is considered easy hiking, with very few sections of rugged and moderately difficult hiking. Much of the trail is close to public roads. There are camping facilities along the trail in the two state forests. Otherwise camping is generally prohibited in the other areas along the trail. There are nearby commercial camping accommodations available on Connecticut Route 198, in particular the Charlie Brown Campground in Eastford and the Nickerson Park Family Campground in Chaplin (visible on the western bank of the Natchaug River from the CCC side trail). Weather along the route is typical of Connecticut. Conditions on exposed ridge tops and summits may be harsher during cold or stormy weather.NOAA Lightning is a hazard on exposed summits and ledges during thunderstorms. Snow is common in the winter and may necessitate the use of snowshoes. Ice can form on exposed ledges and summits, making hiking dangerous without special equipment. Biting insects can be bothersome during warm weather. Parasitic deer ticks (which are known to carry Lyme disease) are a potential hazard. Almost all of the trail is adjacent to, or is on lands where hunting and the use of firearms are permitted. Wearing bright orange clothing during the hunting season (Fall through December) is recommended.

Infant mortality rates are higher in Appalachia than in other parts of the United States. Additionally, poor health in utero, at birth, and in childhood can contribute to poor health throughout life. The region's low income, geographic isolation, and low levels of educational attainment reduce both access to and utilization of modern medical care. Traditional medical practices, including lay midwifery, persisted longer in Appalachia than in other U.S. regions. Health statistics The Appalachian region has higher overall mortality rates than the United States as a whole. Factors considered to contribute to the region's poor health outcomes include low income, geographic isolation, and low levels of educational attainment. Statistics compiled in 1916 indicated that women in southern Appalachia were less likely to die from causes related to childbirth than women in the rest of the U.S., but their babies were less likely to survive their first year. The maternal death rate in southern Appalachia was 12.7 per 100,000 births, compared with rates of 15.1 per 100,000 for the entire rural United States and 16.3 per 100,000 in the nation as a whole. Nationally, the rate of infant mortality was 211.1 per 100,000, but it was higher in five of six southern Appalachian states (all except Tennessee). Infant mortality accounted for one-fourth to one-fifth of all deaths in Kentucky, Maryland, and North Carolina, compared with one-sixth of all deaths in the whole United States. Some observers attributed the high infant mortality to premature births and a practice of feeding infants adult food at too early an age. An analysis performed for the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) found that, as of 2000, 108 of the 406 counties in the ARC region had county-wide shortages of health professionals, 189 counties had shortages in part of the county, and 109 counties had no shortages. Clusters of counties with county-wide shortages were identified in central West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, northeastern Mississippi, and central Alabama. =Availability of hospitals= As of 1999 there were 81 counties in the region that had no hospitals and 203 had a single hospital. Large cities in the region, such as Pittsburgh and Birmingham, had more access to hospitals, including teaching hospitals and medical schools, than the typical Appalachian county. As of 2006, nearly two thirds of counties in the Appalachian region lacked a hospital offering obstetrical services. More than three fourths of the counties lacked facilities for the treatment of the mentally ill. Nearly 90 percent were without programs to address substance abuse. Distressed counties had, on average, one primary care physician for every 2,128 persons and one specialist for every 2,857 individuals. =Infant mortality rates in white and non-white populations= A clear disparity in the level of infant mortality rates between white and non-white populations is made clear by examining the two distributions. Infant mortality rates for the white population range from 1.6 to 17.1 deaths per 1,000 live births. In contrast, infant mortality rates for non-white populations range from 2.3 to 500.0 deaths per 1,000 live births. =March of Dimes statistics= The March of Dimes reports the following 2011 statistics regarding perinatal health in some states that contain the Appalachian Region: Kentucky In an average week in Kentucky: 1,123 babies are born. 158 babies are born preterm. 103 babies are born low birth weight. 8 babies die before their first birthday Alabama In an average week in Alabama: 1,241 babies are born. 195 babies are born preterm. 131 babies are born low birth weight. 11 babies die before reaching their first birthday. Mississippi In an average week in Mississippi: 864 babies are born. 156 babies are born preterm. 102 babies are born low birth weight. 9 babies die before reaching their first birthday. West Virginia In an average week in West Virginia: 413 babies are born. 57 babies are born preterm. 39 babies are born low birth weight. 3 babies die before reaching their first birthday. Health beliefs Many people in the region consider health to be the absence of illness with the ability to be physically active, and are focused on the present. Many tend to delay treatment until symptoms become severe. Others turn to alternative healing methods and herbal remedies. No evidence exists, though, that Appalachians are more likely to postpone care or seek alternative methods of healing than are people elsewhere. The family is the focus for health concerns. If there is a balance of physical, emotional, psychological, spiritual, and social well-being of the family members, then they consider themselves healthy. Some define health as the ability of the family to respond to each other's needs. A family with a disabled or sick member can still consider itself healthy if the needs of that person are addressed and the family cooperates to insure individual health. When a member is gravely ill, the extended family, often gathering together, makes the medical decisions. Granny midwives Until the middle of the 20th century, women commonly known as “granny midwives” attended most births in southern Appalachia. They were members of the community and were not officially trained; they learned how to assist in birth by watching other midwives. While the term “granny” implies that they were old, this was not necessarily the case. They attended births at home and eventually moved into clinics. Eventually obstetricians and physicians entered the scene and more births were occurring outside the home. While “granny midwives” are no longer common in southern Appalachia, direct- entry midwives still practice in certain communities. Granny midwives were greatly respected in their communities. If a family had a horse and buggy, they would send for the midwife and bring her to the home. Many families could not afford this luxury. In this case the midwife would travel by foot to the house. Granny midwives were not experts on birth only. They attended to sick members of the community, educated the people about health, and comforted the dying and their families. Some midwives did not charge for their services. Others had a sliding scale depending on the income of the family. Many families who could not afford midwifery services paid the midwife in other commodities such as food. Prior to the 1940s the midwives were not officially trained. In the latter half the century, however, physicians entered the scene and began offering workshops and classes for these birth attendants. In 1939 the Frontier Graduate School of Midwifery opened in Kentucky. After the opening of the school granny midwives began to be replaced by formally trained women. Today there are very few granny midwives left. They are the last generation, aged now, and unable to practice legally due to restrictive legislation. Midwifery, however, continues to be popular and certified nurse midwives who were trained in nursing schools across the country and then received their master's degree in midwifery at an accredited university often attend births. Frontier Nursing Service In 1925 Mary Breckinridge founded the Kentucky Committee For Mothers and Babies, which three years later became the Frontier Nursing Service. Breckinridge created the organization to address the inadequate health care access throughout the isolated areas of Appalachia. She focused on community involvement and brought midwives from England and Scotland to provide prenatal and maternal care to all who needed it. Her nurses wore blue uniforms and traveled on horseback to deliver care. She originally reached out to nurses abroad because few Americans had the requisite training. Breckenridge founded a hospital in Leslie County, Kentucky, as well as the Frontier Graduate School of Midwifery which opened its doors in 1939. The organization struggled after Breckinridge's death in 1965 but it continues to provide services to the area. Current efforts of the staff concentrate on operating its small rural hospital, running the midwifery school, and providing community-based educational programs. Pregnancy =Prenatal care= In the first half of the century (and prior) prenatal care was practically unheard of in the region. Midwives were not called on until the due date was approaching or labor pains started. In the 1940s and 50s midwives began to be officially trained by outside physicians and were told by physicians to encourage women to come in for a prenatal checkup. =Herbal healing= Granny midwives often used herbs for healing and soothing. Use of herbs in general is a large part of Appalachian culture. Raspberry leaf tea is believed to have effects on the uterus and to be high in vitamins and minerals. It was often recommended for pregnant women and laboring mothers. Nettle tea is recommended for its vitamin K and calcium content, which helps contain bleeding. Labor =Expected due date= Long ago, the expected date of delivery was determined by taking the phase of the moon into consideration. A delivery during a full moon was considered dangerous to the child and the mother. The arrival of the midwife at the home of the expectant mother varied. Sometimes the family would call the midwife when the labor started and sometimes she would arrive at the home a few days before the anticipated birth. This was probably dependent on the proximity of the midwife to the woman’s house. The midwife and her assistant would assist with chores around the house if they were able to arrive early. =Place of birth= Until the 1940s most births in the region occurred at home. The birth of a child was considered an opportunity for family to gather and socialize. Some considered it akin to quilting or corn shucking. Women attended to the birthing woman while men socialized in a different room in the house or out on the porch. Family and friend would come and go throughout the labor, especially if labor was long. =Examinations during labor= Midwives performed intrauterine examinations to inspect if the child was appropriately head first in the birth canal. If the child were not in a proper position midwives would attempt to manipulate the child by hand. Women were allowed to labor in a sitting position if they felt that was comfortable for them. =Speeding up labor= The following were believed to speed up childbirth: ingestion of quinine, turpentine, gunpowder, tansy tea, flaxseed, or slippery (red) elm. Sneezing, which was also believed to hasten labor, would be induced by blowing red pepper or gunpowder through a quill into the mother’s nose (a practice known as “quilling”). Labor could also be quickened by placing a snakeskin around the thigh. A sharp object placed under the bed was believed to “cut” the labor pains or stop hemorrhaging. If an ax was used, one that has cut many trees was considered to be the best. Birth practices Folk beliefs dominated the region in the past and continue to influence birth practices. Bad luck during labor could be caused by a number of things such as the mother raising her hands above her head, a dove mourning outside the window, or a member of the household sweeping the steps after sundown. The practices related to the placenta varied. Some midwives believed the woman would pass the placenta faster if she blew with great force into her fist or clasped her hands together really tight (Encyclopedia). Some women were encouraged to sit on a pot filled with hot water to pass the placenta faster. Placentas were buried deep enough so that they could not be dug up by a human or an animal. If the placenta were dug up, this would bring bad luck, illness, or death to the mother and child. Sometimes the placenta were buried or disposed of in a stream of running water to prevent fever in the mother. Postpartum practices Early midwifery in the region was rather reliant on what was found in the house. String was used to tie cords and oven sterilized cloth was used for diapers. One midwife who practiced in northeast Tennessee mentioned that sometimes there was only enough water to wash her hands after birth, and none to wash the baby. Some midwives refused to attend to unmarried women due to their own religious beliefs. While midwives did not typically offer prenatal care, postnatal care was more common. Midwives sometimes stayed in the house to care for the woman and child, especially if the delivery had been a difficult one. Soft masses such as milk and bread, onion and cornmeal, cow dung, pancakes, or potato scrapings were used to treat mastitis. A cloth soaked in camphor was applied to engorged breasts to draw out milk. Care of the newborn Newborns were held upside down by their feet and lifted up and down to prevent 'livergrown' disorder. Some midwives believed that placing the child next to the mother under the quilt would force 'bold hives' out of the baby's body. Others recommended a little catnip or ground ivy tea, a drop or two of turpentine, or a spoonful of whiskey in order to \\"hive\\" the baby. A piece of cloth was tied around the newborn's waist for six week to protect the navel area which was thought to easily rupture due to its weakness. The newborn’s hair could not be cut during the first few weeks of life for fear of death before six months of age. If a child whose hair was cut too early did not die, it was feared that the child would become a thief later in life. If someone stepped over the child, this would stunt the newborn’s growth. The day of the week on which the child was born also said a lot about the child. Children born on a Tuesday were said to be unlucky.

The 1926–27 New Zealand tour of Britain involved several skirmishes within the Kiwi party. Problems began on the boat journey over, with disputes developing about aspects of the trip and a rift developed between tour manager and coach, Australian Ernest Mair, and seven forwards. The disputes continued once the party arrived in Britain, with one of the rebels being involved in a street fight with another member of the tour party after the opening match. In mid-November, following further disturbances which almost led to the tour party being evicted from their Harrogate hotel, it was decided that coach Mair would withdraw from team selection and match tactics for a period of four weeks. The tour, and the costly disputes, continued with the rebels eventually setting sail for home a week earlier than their colleagues. Three months later all seven players were banned for life by the New Zealand authorities. New Zealand did not visit Europe again until 1939.

The debt ceiling is an aggregate figure that applies to the gross debt, which includes debt in the hands of the public and in intra-government accounts. About 0.5% of debt is not covered by the ceiling.The Debt Limit: History and Recent Increases, October 2013, p 4. Because expenditures are authorized by separate legislation, the debt ceiling does not directly limit government deficits. In effect, it can only restrain the Treasury from paying for expenditures and other financial obligations after the limit has been reached, but which have already been approved (in the budget) and appropriated. When the debt ceiling is actually reached without an increase in the limit having been enacted, Treasury will need to resort to \\"extraordinary measures\\" to temporarily finance government expenditures and obligations until a resolution can be reached. The Treasury has never reached the point of exhausting extraordinary measures, resulting in default, although on some occasions, Congress appeared like it would allow a default to take place. If this situation were to occur, it is unclear whether Treasury would be able to prioritize payments on debt to avoid a default on its bond obligations, but it would at least have to default on some of its non-bond payment obligations. A protracted default could trigger a variety of economic problems including a financial crisis, and a decline in output that would put the country into an economic recession.Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Debt Ceiling Brinkmanship. US Department of the Treasury, 2013. Management of the United States public debt is an important part of the macroeconomics of the United States economy and finance system, and the debt ceiling is a constraint on the executive's ability to manage the U.S. economy. There is debate, however, on how the U.S. economy should be managed, and whether a debt ceiling is an appropriate mechanism for restraining government spending. Background Under Article I Section 8 of the United States Constitution, only Congress can authorize the borrowing of money on the credit of the United States. From the founding of the United States until 1917, Congress directly authorized each individual debt issued. To provide more flexibility to finance the United States' involvement in World War I, Congress modified the method by which it authorized debt in the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917.P.L. 65-43, 40 Stat. 288, enacted September 24, 1917, Currently codified as amended as 31 U.S.C. § 3101. Under this Act, Congress established an aggregate limit, or \\"ceiling,\\" on the total amount of new bonds that could be issued. The present debt ceiling is an aggregate limit applied to nearly all federal debt, which was substantially established by the Public Debt Acts of 1939 and 1941 which have subsequently been amended to change the ceiling amount. From time to time, political disputes arise when the Treasury advises Congress that the debt ceiling is about to be reached and indicating that a default is imminent. When the debt ceiling is reached, and pending an increase in the limit, Treasury may resort to \\"extraordinary measures\\" to buy more time before the ceiling can be raised by Congress. The United States has never reached the point of default where Treasury was incapable of paying U.S. debt obligations, though it has been close on several occasions. The only exception was during the War of 1812 when parts of Washington D.C. including the Treasury were burned. In 2011, the United States reached a crisis point of near default on public debt. The delay in raising the debt ceiling resulted in the first downgrade in the United States credit rating, a sharp drop in the stock market, and an increase in borrowing costs. Congress raised the debt limit with the Budget Control Act of 2011, which added to the fiscal cliff when the new ceiling was reached on December 31, 2012. Another debt ceiling crisis arose in early 2013 when the ceiling was reached again, and Treasury adopted extraordinary measures to avoid a default. The 2013 crisis was temporarily resolved on February 4, 2013 when President Barack Obama signed the No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013 which suspended the debt ceiling until May 19, 2013. After May 19, the debt ceiling was raised to $16.699 trillion, the level of debt incurred during the suspension, and Treasury resumed extraordinary measures. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew notified Congress that these measures would be exhausted by October 17, 2013. On October 7, 2013, the Treasury warned that the debt ceiling and extraordinary measures would be exhausted and that a default would occur on October 17 when interest payments came due. The debt ceiling would again have been reached on November 3, 2015. On October 30, 2015 the debt ceiling was again suspended to March 2017.The Wall Street Journal, October 30, 2015: After Debt-Ceiling Deal, a Sense of Futility Grows in Congress As of July 2019, it appeared that the government may default on its obligations within a couple months. The budget problem was caused in part by lower tax revenue (due to new tax legislation that took effect in the 2018 tax year under which many companies had their taxes drastically reduced) and in part by the government having already reached its borrowing limit ($22 trillion as of March 2019).  Relationship to federal budget  The process of setting the debt ceiling is separate and distinct from the United States budget process, and raising the debt ceiling neither directly increases nor decreases the budget deficit, and vice versa. The Government Accountability Office explains, \\"the debt limit does not control or limit the ability of the federal government to run deficits or incur obligations. Rather, it is a limit on the ability to pay obligations already incurred.\\" The President formulates a federal budget every year, which Congress must pass, sometimes with amendments, in a concurrent resolution, which does not require the President's signature and is not binding. The budget details projected tax collections and expenditures and, therefore, specifies the amount of borrowing the government would have to do in that fiscal year. Legislative history Prior to 1917, the United States had no debt ceiling. Congress either authorized specific loans or allowed Treasury to issue certain debt instruments and individual debt issues for specific purposes. Sometimes Congress gave Treasury discretion over what type of debt instrument would be issued. The United States first instituted a statutory debt limit with the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917. This legislation set limits on the aggregate amount of debt that could be accumulated through individual categories of debt (such as bonds and bills). In 1939, Congress instituted the first limit on total accumulated debt over all kinds of instruments. Prior to the Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the debt ceiling played an important role enabling Congress to hold hearings and debates on the budget. James Surowiecki argued that the debt ceiling lost its usefulness after these reforms to the budget process. In 1979, noting the potential problems of hitting a default, Dick Gephardt imposed the \\"Gephardt Rule,\\" a parliamentary rule that deemed the debt ceiling raised when a budget was passed. This resolved the contradiction in voting for appropriations but not voting to fund them. The rule stood until it was repealed by Congress in 1995. President Ronald Reagan fought bi-partisan resistance from Congress for a 1981 raising of the debt limit.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oYBIAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=rW0DAAAAIBAJ&pg;=2493%2C606852 =1995 and 1996 debt ceiling crisis= US federal government debt ceiling from 1990 to January 2012 (unadjusted for GDP and population The debt-ceiling debate of 1995 led to a showdown on the federal budget, which did not pass, and resulted in the United States federal government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996.U.S. GAO, \\"Debt Ceiling: Analysis of Actions During the 1995-1996 Crisis\\", AIMD-96-130, 1996 August 30New Republic, \\"How Clinton Handled His Debt Ceiling Crisis Better Than Obama\\", Kara Brandeisky, 2 August 2011 =2011 debt ceiling crisis= In 2011, Republicans in Congress demanded deficit reduction as part of raising the debt ceiling. The resulting contention was resolved on 2 August 2011 by the Budget Control Act of 2011. Under the \\"McConnell Rule,\\" the president was allowed to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling. This action could be overturned by an act of Congress, but this would require a 2/3 majority vote in both houses assuming that the president vetoed the act. On 5 August 2011, S&P; issued the first ever downgrade in the federal government's credit rating, citing their April warnings, the difficulty of bridging the parties and that the resulting agreement fell well short of the hoped-for comprehensive 'grand bargain'. The credit downgrade and debt ceiling debacle contributed to the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling nearly 2,000 points in late July and August. Following the downgrade itself, the DJIA had one of its worst days in history and fell 635 points on August 8. =2013 debt ceiling crisis= Following the increase in the debt ceiling to $16.394 trillion in 2011, the United States again reached the debt ceiling on December 31, 2012 and the Treasury began taking extraordinary measures. The fiscal cliff was resolved with the passage of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), but no action was taken on the debt ceiling. Following the tax cuts from ATRA, the government needed to raise the debt ceiling by $700 billion to finance operations for the rest of the 2013 fiscal year. Extraordinary measures were expected to be exhausted by February 15. The Treasury had said it is not set up to prioritize payments, and has given the opinion that it is unclear whether it would be legal to do so. Given this situation, the Treasury would simply delay payments if funds could not be raised through extraordinary measures and the debt ceiling not raised. Economists estimated that such an action would cause GDP to contract by 7%, which is larger than the contraction during the Great Recession. The economic damage would worsen as recipients of social security benefits, government contracts, and other government payments cut back on spending in response to having the freeze in their revenue. Under the No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013, both houses of Congress voted to suspend the debt ceiling from February 4, 2013 until May 19, 2013. On May 19, the debt ceiling was raised to approximately $16.699 trillion to accommodate the borrowing done during the suspension period. Debt not covered by ceiling As of October 2013, about 0.5% of debt was not covered by the ceiling. This includes outstanding pre-1917 debt. In December 2012, Treasury calculated that $239 million in United States Notes were in circulation. These Notes, in accordance the debt ceiling legislation, are excluded from the statutory debt limit. The $239 million excludes $25 million in United States Notes issued prior to July 1, 1929, determined pursuant to Act of June 30, 1961, 31 U.S.C. 5119, to have been destroyed or irretrievably lost. Debts of the Federal Financing Bank which at August 2013 totalled $73.1 billionFederal Financing Bank Press Release are also not subject to the ceiling. Suspension of debt ceiling The No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013 suspended, for the first time, the U.S. debt ceiling on February 4, 2013 until May 18, 2013. During the suspension period, Treasury was authorized to borrow to the extent that it \\"is required to meet existing commitments\\". On May 19, the debt ceiling was raised by $306 billion to cover the borrowings done during the suspension period, as well as commitments that accrued in the preceding period that extraordinary measures were in place, which commenced on December 31, 2012. The debt ceiling was again suspended on October 17 until February 7, 2014. On February 12, 2014, the Temporary Debt Limit Extension Act was passed, suspending the debt ceiling until March 15, 2015. At that time, the Treasury Department took extraordinary measures. On October 30, 2015 the debt ceiling was again suspended to March 2017. Extraordinary measures The Treasury Department is permitted to borrow funds needed to fund government operations, as had been authorized by congressional appropriations, up to the debt ceiling, with some small exceptions. In a letter to Congress of April 4, 2011, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner explained that when the debt ceiling is reached, Treasury can declare a \\"debt issuance suspension period\\" during which it can take \\"extraordinary measures\\" to continue meeting federal obligations provided that it does not involve the issue of new debt. These measures are taken to avoid, as far as resources permit, a partial government shutdown or a default on the debt. These methods have been used on several previous occasions in which federal debt neared its statutory limit.Government Accountability Office, Delays Create Debt Management Challenges and Increase Uncertainty in the Treasury Market, GAO-11-203, February 2011. Extraordinary measures can include suspending investments in the G Fund of the Thrift Savings Plan of individual retirement funds of federal employees. In 2011, extraordinary measures included suspending investments in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF), the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (Postal Benefits Fund), and the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). In addition, certain CSRDF investments were also redeemed early. In 1985, the Treasury had also exchanged Treasury securities for non-Treasury securities held by the Federal Financing Bank. However, these amounts are not sufficient to cover government operations for extended periods. Treasury first implemented these measures on December 16, 2009 to avoid a government shutdown. These measures were implemented again on May 16, 2011, when Treasury Secretary Geithner declared a \\"debt issuance suspension period\\". According to his letter to Congress, this period could \\"last until August 2, 2011, when the Department of the Treasury projects that the borrowing authority of the United States will be exhausted\\". The measures were again implemented on December 31, 2012 being the start of the debt ceiling crisis of 2013 with the default trigger date ticking to February 2013. The crisis was deferred with the suspension of the limit on February 4, and the cancellation of the extraordinary measures. The measures were again invoked at the end of the ceiling's suspension on May 19, 2013 with the date of exhaustion of the resources and the default trigger date being estimated by Treasury as October 17. The ceiling was again suspended by legislation on that date until February 4, 2014. Default on financial obligations If the debt ceiling is not raised and extraordinary measures are exhausted, the United States government is legally unable to borrow money to pay its financial obligations. At that point, it must cease making payments unless the treasury has cash on hand to cover them. In addition, the government would not have the resources to pay the interest on (and sometime redeem) government securities when due, which would be characterized as a default. A default may affect the United States' sovereign risk rating and the interest rate that it will be required to pay on future debt. The United States has never defaulted on its financial obligations, but the periodic crises relating to the debt ceiling has led to a rating downgrade by several rating agencies and a warning by others. The GAO estimated that the delay in raising the debt ceiling during the debt ceiling crisis of 2011 raised borrowing costs for the government by $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2011 and noted that the delay would also raise costs in later years. The Bipartisan Policy Center extended the GAO's estimates and found that the delay raised borrowing costs by $18.9 billion over ten years. Some writers have expressed the view that if extraordinary measures are exhausted, the executive branch has the authority to determine which obligations are paid and which are not, though Treasury has argued that all obligations are on equal footing under the law. The writers have argued that the executive branch can choose to prioritize interest payments on bonds, which would avoid an immediate, direct default on sovereign debt. During the debt ceiling crisis of 2011, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geitner argued that prioritization of interest payments would not help since government expenditures would have needed to be cut by an unrealistic 40% if the debt ceiling is not raised. Also, a default on non-debt obligations would still undermine American creditworthiness according to at least one rating agency. In 2011, the Treasury suggested that it could not prioritize certain types of expenditures because all expenditures are on equal footing under the law. In this view, when extraordinary measures are exhausted, no payments could be made except when money (such as tax receipts) is in the treasury, at all and the United States would be in default on all of its obligations. The CBO notes that prioritization would not avoid the technical definition found in Black's Law Dictionary where default is defined as “the failure to make a payment when due.” Debate on debt ceiling A vote to increase the debt ceiling has usually been (since the 1950s) a legal budgetary formality between the President and Congress. The debt ceiling has not historically been a political issue that would make the elected government fail to pass a yearly budget. Reports to Congress (from the OMB and other sources) in the 1990s have repeatedly stated that the debt limit is an ineffective means to restrain the growth of debt. James Surowiecki argues that the debt ceiling originally served a useful purpose. When introduced, presidents had stronger authority to borrow and spend as they pleased. However, after 1974 and the Nixon Administration the US Congress began passing comprehensive budget resolutions that specify exactly how much money the government could spend. The apparent redundancy of the debt ceiling has led to suggestions that it should be abolished altogether. Several Democratic House members, including Peter Welch, proposed abolishing the debt ceiling. The proposal found support from some economists such as Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. In January 2013, a survey of 38 highly regarded economists found that 84% agreed that, since Congress already approves spending and taxation, \\"a separate debt ceiling that has to be increased periodically creates unneeded uncertainty and can potentially lead to worse fiscal outcomes.\\" Only one member of the panel, Luigi Zingales, disagreed with the statement. Rating agency Moody's has stated that \\"the debt limit creates a high level of uncertainty\\" and that the government should change \\"its framework for managing government debt to lessen or eliminate that uncertainty\\".

Background The Boarding School was written by Hannah Webster Foster in 1798. Foster is best known for her epistolary novel The Coquette. As writing was not considered to be a viable career choice for a woman, she published both of her novels as \\"A Lady of Massachusetts\\". The Boarding School focuses on a fictitious school called Harmony Grove as another school year ends and a group of students is completing their course of study at the school. The novel itself focuses on the ideal education to best prepare these women for their future. The narrative portion of the work is supposed to represent the final lessons that the teacher is giving to her students on how to best use the education that they have received at Harmony Grove when they enter into society.  Plot summary  The novel is not divided into chapters, but there are two distinct sections of the work. The first focuses on the school and the week of lessons, and the second section is a collection of letters written between the students and to the teacher. The first section represents a more traditional narrative structure and will be discussed below as the \\"Narrative\\" section and the second section is labeled \\"Letters\\". = Narrative = The Narrative portion of the novel serves two purposes. First, it serves as an introduction to Harmony Grove and its preceptress Mrs. Williams and it is also the section that details the final lectures that Mrs. Williams is giving to her students as they are finishing up their time at the school. There are eleven individual lessons ranging from more academic topics such as reading and writing, to artistic pursuits, even to her opinions on more personal subjects of dress and friendship. Mrs. Williams does not just give the girls her opinions on these matters; she uses examples of past students and girls that she knew to show both the right and wrong things for her students to do in their lives outside of the school. The opinions that are expressed in this section are those of Foster herself, veiled by the fiction this is touted to be. =Letters= The section of the novel that contains the letters of Harmony Grove students shows how the girls put into practice the lessons that Mrs. Williams taught them. The letters contain commentary on the fashions of the time, both sartorial and cultural, as well as the new graduates adjustments back into the world. Comments are made on the actions of other women who had not been at Harmony Grove, stating whether or not they are appropriate. Using an epistolary structure, Foster attempts to instruct her ideal readers, young women like the characters in the book, in the proper course of behavior and the ideal result of a proper education.

Carr contributed to successful recordings by Joan Baez, Luther Ingram, Bob Seger, Joe Cocker, Boz Scaggs, Paul Simon, The Staple Singers, Rod Stewart, Barbra Streisand, Wilson Pickett, Hank Williams, Jr., among many others, from the 1970s onward. Carr recorded and produced four solo albums and was half of the duet LeBlanc and Carr. He recorded extensively at FAME Recording Studio in Muscle Shoals, Alabama and Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Sheffield, Alabama. He was lead guitarist for the famed Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. Carr was known for versatility, using both electric and acoustic guitars to perform a vast array of musical styles including folk, rock, pop, country, blues and soul. In addition, Carr added depth to his understanding of the recording studio environment by engineering and producing numerous albums over the years which has led to several Grammy nominations. In 1974, Paul Simon's There Goes Rhymin' Simon album was nominated for two Grammy Awards; and Against the Wind by Bob Seger earned two Grammys in 1981.Rolling Stone, November 26, 1981, p. 53-67 In addition, Carr co-produced Seger's Stranger in Town album which featured the hit \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\". Early life Carr was born in Daytona Beach, Florida and started to play the guitar at age 13. The Beatles and the Rolling Stones were major influences on his early interest in music. Carr later became interested in guitar instrumentals such as \\"Walk, Don't Run\\" by The Ventures, which he learned note for note by listening to the record. Around this time a guitar player from Memphis, Travis Wammack, released an instrumental guitar record named \\"Scratchy\\". The other side of the record was named \\"Fire Fly\\". When Carr heard \\"Scratchy\\" on the radio he was so impressed he immediately went out and bought the record. Carr also learned from listening to guitarists such as James Burton, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Duane Allman, Ted Connors and Chet Atkins. At the age of 15, Carr went to see the Allman Joys play at the Club Martinique in Daytona Beach. Carr, with guitar case in hand, introduced himself when the band took a break and asked Gregg Allman to show him some guitar lines. Gregg replied, \\"That's my brother, Duane's, department.\\" At that point Carr introduced himself to Duane Allman. That meeting began a friendship which lasted until Allman's tragic death in a motorcycle crash October 29, 1971.Gritz Magazine, May 2000 issue. In 1968, Carr, Gregg Allman, Duane Allman, Paul Hornsby and Johnny Sandlin, in a group named Hour Glass, played together on the Power of Love album. Also in 1968, Hour Glass recorded songs in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, at Rick Hall's FAME Studios which was known for innovative productions and great sound.Randy Poe, \\"Skydog: The Duane Allman Story\\", (New York: Backbeat Books, 2006), p. 49-54. One song recording at FAME, \\"Sweet Little Angel\\", was later released in a Duane Allman Anthology set. Session work Pete Carr during his studio years. Carr found that he preferred sessions work in recording studios along with the engineering and producing aspects of making music, so he moved to Muscle Shoals, Alabama around the age of 20 to pursue a studio career. Johnny Wyker and Court Pickett would soon start work on their Motorcycle Mama album under the artist name of \\"Sailcat\\". Carr contributed as musician, engineer and producer on the project. The album was a commercial success for the new Muscle Shoals producer and after this, Carr replaced Eddie Hinton as lead guitarist for the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. The 1970s were among the most productive of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section as the cream of rock, pop and soul found their way to 3614 Jackson Highway in Sheffield, Alabama. Carr played on almost all sessions recorded at the studio for the next 10 years. A good example of Carr's musical ability and taste is the standout guitar lines he played on the Bob Seger hit \\"Main Street\\". The Rhythm Section (including Carr) co-produced Paul Simon's There Goes Rhymin' Simon which earned them a Grammy nomination in 1974. Carr continued as the premier session guitarist in the Muscle Shoals area playing on projects for artists recording at the main studios and also produced two guitar instrumental albums himself. This strengthened Carr's reputation as one of the South's best studio session guitarists, as well as an artist in his own right. Jerry Wexler, a world-renowned record executive and producer, helped Carr find a record label for his productions. Carr put together the group with Lenny LeBlanc, LeBlanc & Carr, and created the album Midnight Light as both artist and producer. The song \\"Falling\\" became a big hit for LeBlanc & Carr. \\"Falling\\" was mixed at FAME Studios which is where Carr did most of the mixing for his production projects. The group's first tour was supposed to be with Lynyrd Skynyrd on their Street Survivors Tour but that ended tragically with an airplane crash in Mississippi, October 20, 1977. After this tragedy, and other band problems, Carr decided to return to the studio. Carr is listed on the Dan Igor Glenn 1976 album This Train Is Bound For Glory as a session guitarist in Muscle Shoals. His lead acoustic guitar can be heard on the song \\"Wreck of the Old 97\\".Vinyl LP jacket, also found on the cassette inlay card. LP has been out of print for many years. Pete Carr had distinguished himself as the only studio musician in the Muscle Shoals area to succeed as studio musician, artist, composer, engineer and producer. Tom Dowd called Carr to Los Angeles to play on a Rod Stewart album which produced the big hit \\"Tonight's The Night\\". Carr's guitar playing was a prominent part of the hit. He layered rhythm and lead guitars throughout the song.The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll (Simon & Schuster, 2001). In 1981 Carr was chosen to play for the Simon and Garfunkel Reunion World Tour and the HBO Central Park Concert on September 19, 1981 where he played acoustic and electric guitars. Over half a million people were in attendance for the concert. Rolling Stone magazine gave Carr a rave review for his bluesy and tasty electric guitar solo on the Barbra Streisand song \\"Make it Like a Memory\\" from her Grammy award-winning Guilty album.Rolling Stone, December 11, 1980, p. 56. Guilty was Streisand's biggest selling album in her recording history. On the song \\"Woman in Love\\" from the same album, Carr's opening harmony guitar lines were notably unique and hard to categorize but effective in introducing this Streisand hit. Carr's contribution to American music continues to be heard daily around the globe. Songs featuring Carr's lead guitar such as Bob Seger's \\"Mainstreet\\" and Paul Simon's \\"Kodachrome\\" are standards. During the Falklands War of 1982, as British battle ships set sail to reclaim the Islands the BBC (The British Broadcasting Corporation) played the Rod Stewart song \\"Sailing\\" nationwide. \\"Sailing\\" featured Carr's acoustic and electric guitar playing.

On 21 January 1947, the former state of Lippe was merged with North Rhine-Westphalia. Julius Caesar At around 55BC, the time of Julius Caesar, the territories west of the Rhine in this region were occupied by the Eburones, one of the tribes he identified as \\"Germani cisrhenani\\", who lived within the part of Gaul associated with the Belgae. Caesar reports that he tried to annihilate the Eburones and their name. Once part of the Roman empire, their country was occupied by a Germanic tribe with a different name, the Tungri. However, Tacitus reported that \\"Tungri\\" was a new name for the original \\"Germani\\", stating that in fact the first tribal group to be called by that name were the ones from west of the Rhine.Tacitus, Germania, II 2. ceterum Germaniae vocabulum recens et nuper additum, quoniamqui primi Rhenum transgressi Gallos expulerint ac nunc Tungri, tunc Germani vocati sint: ita nationis nomen, nongentis, evaluisse paulatim, ut omnes primum a victore obmetum, mox et a se ipsis invento nomine Germani vocarentur. (Although the term \\"Germani\\" was used, and Caesar and other Roman historians clearly reported that there was kinship with tribes East of the Rhine, there is evidence that these early tribes on both sides of the Rhine used Celtic languages.) Of the related tribes on the eastern bank of the Rhine, Caesar reported the Ubii, who were already requesting permission to migrate over the Rhine as they later would, near modern Cologne, and the Sugambri, who lived to the north of them near the modern Rhine-Ruhr area. Both tribes were under pressure from Suebi who had moved into the region to their east, and while he was in the area a major migration occurred under this pressure, with large numbers of Usipeti and Tencteri moving into the area near the Sugambri, and eventually attempting to cross the Rhine near where it joins the Maas, only to be pushed back aggressively by Caesar. They were still to be found near the eastern banks of the Rhine during imperial times. Roman Empire and the Franks Julius Caesar conquered the tribes on the left (western) bank of the Rhine, and Augustus established numerous fortified posts along it, but the Romans never succeeded in gaining a firm footing on the right bank. During imperial times all or most of North Rhine-Westphalia west of the Rhine was split out from Belgica as a frontier province, Germania Inferior, and there were new settlers brought into the area, some from across the Rhine such as the Ubii. The Ubii's region including modern Neuss, Cologne and Bonn, was called the \\"Civitas Ubiorum\\" and apparently also included the Sunuci. The Cugerni, who lived in the \\"Civitas Traiana\\" near Xanten during imperial times, are often thought to be Sugambri who had been resettled by the Romans west of the Rhine. Also living in the Traiana were the Betasii. (The other parts of Germania Inferior were mainly in the areas of modern Belgium and the Netherlands.) East of the Rhine, Roman historians such as Tacitus report that to the north of the Sugambri were also the Bructeri, who pushed further south into the Sugambrian area during imperial times, under pressure from their northern neighbours the Chamavi and Angrivarii. North of them, in turn, and probably still in Westphalia, were the Chasuarii and Dulgubnii. Another tribe living east of the Rhine near the Sugambri, possibly as a sub- tribe, were the Marsi. The Usipetes who Caesar had reported as arriving in the area in his time stayed in the region north of the Rhine near where it joins the Maas, while the Tencteri moved into the area vacated by the Ubii, facing Cologne. Around 1 A.D. there were numerous incursions through Westphalia and perhaps even some permanent Roman or Romanized settlements. The Battle of Teutoburg Forest took place near Osnabrück (as mentioned, it is disputed whether this is in Westphalia) and some of the tribes who fought at this battle came from the area of Westphalia. By late Roman times it appears that whatever remained of these tribal groupings began to be referred to as the Franks, who were being pressed from the North by the Saxons. As the power of the Roman empire declined the Franks crossed the Rhine. For example, the Chattuari moved from somewhere near the Chamavi, into the area around Xanten, as well as the area previously inhabited by the Sugambri. By the end of the 5th century, Franks had conquered all the left bank lands of North Rhine- Westphalia, but Saxons were pushing into Westphalia, the name of which has its origins as one of the original main parts of their territory. By the 8th century the Frankish dominion was firmly established in most of western Germany and northern Gaul. Lasting hegemony over the Saxons, including those in Westphalia, was achieved in the 9th century by Charlemagne in the Saxon wars. Holy Roman empire Charlemagne is thought to have spent considerable time in Paderborn and nearby parts. His Saxon Wars also partly took place in what is thought of as Westphalia today. Popular legends link his adversary Widukind to places near Detmold, Bielefeld, Lemgo, Osnabrück and other places in Westphalia. Widukind was buried in Enger, which is also a subject of a legend. Ratification of the Peace of Westphalia of 1648 in Münster by Gerard Terborch (1617-1681) Along with Eastphalia and Engern, Westphalia (Westfalahi) was originally a district of the Duchy of Saxony. In 1180 Westphalia was elevated to the rank of a duchy by Emperor Barbarossa. The Duchy of Westphalia comprised only a small area south of the Lippe River. On the division of the Carolingian Empire at the Treaty of Verdun the part of the province to the east of the river fell to East Francia, while that to the west remained with the kingdom of Lotharingia. By the time of Otto I. (d. 973) both banks of the Rhine had become part of the Holy Roman Empire, and the Rhenish territory was divided between the duchies of Upper Lorraine, on the Mosel, and Lower Lorraine on the Meuse. As the central power of the Holy Roman Emperor weakened, the Rhineland split up into numerous small independent principalities, each with its separate vicissitudes and special chronicles. The old Lotharingian divisions became obsolete, and the name of Lorraine became restricted to the district that still bears it. In spite of its dismembered condition, and the sufferings it underwent at the hands of its French neighbours in various periods of warfare, the Rhenish territory prospered greatly and stood in the foremost rank of German culture and progress. Aachen was the place of coronation of the German emperors, and the ecclesiastical principalities of the Rhine bulked largely in German history. Middle Ages Parts of Westphalia came under Brandenburg-Prussian control during the 17th and 18th centuries, but most of it remained divided duchies and other feudal areas of power. The Peace of Westphalia of 1648, signed in Münster and Osnabrück, ended the Thirty Years' War. The concept of nation- state sovereignty resulting from the treaty became known as \\"Westphalian sovereignty\\". Early modern era The Prussian Province of Westphalia in 1905 As a result of the Protestant Reformation, there is no dominant religion in Westphalia. Roman Catholicism and Lutheranism are on relatively equal footing. Lutheranism is strong in the eastern and northern parts with numerous free churches. Münster and especially Paderborn are thought of as Catholic. Osnabrück is divided almost equally between Catholicism and Protestantism. After the defeat of the Prussian Army at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 made the Westphalian territories part of the Kingdom of Westphalia from 1807–13. It was founded by Napoleon and was a French vassal state. This state only shared the name with the historical region; it contained only a relatively small part of Westphalia, consisting instead mostly of Hessian and Eastphalian regions. After the Congress of Vienna, the Kingdom of Prussia received a large amount of territory in the Westphalian region and created the province of Westphalia in 1815. The northernmost portions of the former kingdom, including the town of Osnabrück, had become part of the states of Hanover and Oldenburg. Prussian influence Prussia first set foot on the Rhine in 1609 by the occupation of the Duchy of Cleves and about a century later Upper Guelders and Moers also became Prussian. At the peace of Basel in 1795 the whole of the left bank of the Rhine was resigned to France, and in 1806 the Rhenish princes all joined the Confederation of the Rhine. The congress of Vienna assigned the whole of the lower Rhenish districts to Prussia, which had the tact to leave them in undisturbed possession of the liberal institutions they had become accustomed to under the republican rule of the French. In 1920, the Saar was separated from the Rhine Province and administered by the League of Nations until a plebiscite in 1935, when the region was returned to the German Reich. At the same time, in 1920, the districts of Eupen and Malmedy were transferred to Belgium (see German-Speaking Community of Belgium). In 1946, the Rhine Province was divided into the newly founded states of Hesse, North Rhine- Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate. Creation of the state North Rhine- Westphalia was established by the British military administration's \\"Operation Marriage\\" on 23 August 1946. Originally, it consisted of Westphalia and the northern parts of the Rhine Province, both formerly part of Prussia. On 21 January 1947, the former state of Lippe was merged with North Rhine- Westphalia. The constitution of North Rhine-Westphalia was then ratified through a referendum.

In the post-WWII recovery, the Ruhr was one of the most important industrial regions in Europe, and contributed to the German Wirtschaftswunder. As of the late 1960s, repeated crises had led to contractions of these industrial branches. On the other hand, producing sectors, particularly in mechanical engineering and metal and iron working industries, experienced substantial growth. Some former coal mining areas retain high unemployment rates. Despite this structural change and an economic growth which was under the national average, the 2007 GDP of 529.4 billion euro (21.8 percent of the total German GDP) made the land the economically most important in Germany, as well as one of the most important economic areas in the world. Of Germany’s top 100 corporations, 37 are based in North Rhine- Westphalia. On a per capita basis, however, North Rhine-Westphalia (Nordrhein- Westfalen) remains one of the weaker among the Western German Länder, or states. As of June 2014, the unemployment rate is 8.2%, second highest among all western German states. North Rhine-Westphalia attracts companies from both Germany and abroad, with 26 of the 50 largest German companies based in Germany's most westerly federal state. These include leading German corporations such as E.ON (energy), Deutsche Telekom (telecommunications), Deutsche Post World Net (logistics), Metro AG (food trade), ThyssenKrupp (automotive supplier), RWE (energy) and Rewe Gruppe (trade). The state can rightly claim the most foreign direct investments (FDI) anywhere in Germany.Rivergate  Federal States of Germany With 28.7 percent (187.6 billion euros), North Rhine-Westphalia recorded by far the highest direct investment share in Germany of all 16 federal states in 2008. Around 11,500 foreign companies from the most important investment countries control their German or European operations from bases in North Rhine-Westphalia. This means that almost a quarter of the foreign companies in Germany are domiciled there. These include many international global players such as 3M, BP, Ericsson, Ford, LG Electronics, QVC, Sony, Renault, Toyota, and Vodafone. The companies employ a total of over 582,000 people. Their activities range from pure production to sophisticated services. There have been many changes in the state's economy in recent times. Among them, the creative industries have come to outrank the mining sector in terms of employment. Industrial heritage sites are now workplaces for designers, artists and the advertising industry. The Ruhr region, formerly known as the \\"land of coal and steel\\" (Land von Kohle und Stahl), has - since the 1960s - undergone a significant structural change away from coal mining and steel industry.

Encompassing a total area of more than 7200 hectares, the Department of Conservation Te Papa Atawhai manages 5,923 hectares of peat bog, swamp, mesotrophic lags, open water and river systems listed as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. Fish and Game New Zealand are the second largest landowner, managing 748 hectares of the wetland primarily as gamebird hunting habitat. The site is also one of three of New Zealand’s foremost wetlands included in the Arawai Kākāriki wetland restoration programme, which aims to “enhance the ecological restoration of three of New Zealand’s foremost wetland/freshwater sites, making use of strong community involvement and promoting research into wetland restoration techniques”.  Ecosystems and biodiversity  Australasian bittern/matuku (Botaurus poiciloptilus) Corybas carsei) Whangamarino Wetland consists of a rich and representative variety of wetland ecosystems (peat bog, swamp, mesotrophic lags, open water and river systems); one of the features that lent support to its designation under the Ramsar Convention. 239 species of wetland plants are found in the Whangamarino, 60 percent of which are indigenous. A number of these are uncommon or extremely rare, including the water milfoil Myriophyllum robustum, the clubmoss Lycopodium serpentinum, and the critically endangered swamp helmet orchid Corybas carsei, now found nowhere else in the world. Baumea spp., mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium) and wire rush (Empodisma minus) are the dominant vegetation of the peat bogs, while greater species diversity is found in the mineralised swamp zones, including introduced species such as grey willow (Salix cinerea) and crack willow (Salix fragilia). Mosses and lichens are also well represented in the wetland. These diverse ecosystems provide habitat to a wide range of native wetland birds, including the Australasian bittern/matuku (Botaurus poiciloptilus). Approximately 20 percent of New Zealand's breeding bittern population can be found in the Whangamarino. The wetland is also an important site for a number of other rare or threatened wetland birds, including spotless crake/pūweto (Porzana tabuensis plumbea), marsh crake/koitareke (Porzana pusilla), North Island fernbird/mātātā (Bowdleria punctata vealeae), and New Zealand dabchick/weweia (Poliocephalus rufopectus). Occasionally the Whangamarino is visited by other unusual birds such as royal spoonbill/kōtuku-ngutupapa (Platalea regia) and Japanese snipe (Gallinago hardwickii), which helps keeps amateur ornithologists interested in the site. The wetland provides habitat for a diverse range of native freshwater fish, including a significant population of the threatened black mudfish/waikaka (Neochanna diversus). It is also home to longfin and shortfin eel/tuna and other galaxiid species. Introduced invasive fish species are also present in Whangamarino Wetland; koi carp (Cyprinus carpio) and brown bullhead catfish (Ameiurus nebulosus) are a particular problem as their aggressive feeding behaviour stirs up bottom sediments, affecting bank stabilisation and aquatic plant life. A study of koi carp otiliths undertaken by University of Waikato MSc student Jennifer Blair found that Lake Waikare and the Pungarehu Stream appear to be a source of recruits, with koi carp moving from these areas into the Waikato River and Lake Waahi.  Hydrology  Hydrology is a driving component of wetlands, with many plants and animals uniquely adapted to the seasonal wet/dry cycle. Whangamarino Wetland is fed by a catchment area of approximately 48,900 hectares. During the 1960s the hydrology of the Whangamarino was significantly impacted by the implementation of the Lower Waikato-Waipa Flood Control Scheme managed by Waikato Regional Council, and has also been impacted by the extraction of sand and hydro-power generation on the Waikato River. The flood control scheme is intended to replicate the natural water storage function of Lake Waikare and Whangamarino Wetland in a highly manipulated and more controlled way. To do this, the direction of the Te Onetea Stream was reversed to transport water from the Waikato River into Lake Waikare during high river flows, while the level of Lake Waikare was lowered by one metre. The lake is kept to a strict fluctuation regime of approximately 0.3 metres and flood gates control the movement of water into the Whangamarino Wetland via the artificial Pungarehu Canal. Water is then stored in the Whangamarino until it is released back into the Waikato River via flood gates on the Whangamarino River. In 1994 the construction of a rock rubble weir on the Whangamarino River was commissioned by the Department of Conservation and the Auckland/Waikato Fish and Game Council. The weir maintains minimum summer water levels in approximately 1,400 hectares of the mineralised wetland and helps recreate a seasonal hydrological cycle. The single-track North Island Main Trunk railway line crosses the wetland, and it has been proposed that two million tonnes of spoil from the Auckland City Rail Link could be used to double-track the busy section of line which is a bottleneck on the section between Auckland (Papakura) and Hamilton.  Ecosystem services  Whangamarino Wetland looking west from Falls Road in 1991 Sometimes known as 'nature's benefits’, ecosystem services are the benefits (usually to humans) provided by natural ecosystems. They include provisions such as clean drinking water, supporting processes like the decomposition of wastes, and cultural benefits such as spiritual or recreational opportunities. Wetlands provide an astonishing array of ecosystem services for the local community. These include mitigating the effects of flood and drought, replenishing groundwater, helping filter sediment and nutrients and purify water, providing reservoirs of biodiversity and wetland resources, providing for cultural values, recreation and tourism, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. The Lower Waikato-Waipa Flood Protection Scheme has been estimated to save the Waikato Region $5.2 million (in 2007 dollars) by limiting damage to surrounding farmland during times of peak flood events. Farmers are a particular benefactor of wetland ecosystem services. On good quality wetland margins, damp soils and dense pockets of native rushes and sedges are effective in: * Converting nitrogen from surface runoff and leaching to nitrogen gas which is returned to the atmosphere (denitrification); * Trapping sediments that flow over land, helping to prevent infilling and sedimentation; * Filtering and trapping effluent particles; * Trapping bacteria and other harmful micro-organisms, which then are killed by exposure to sunlight or are retained by the soil; * Retaining water by maintaining the ground water table and soil moisture levels; * Protecting land from flood damage by absorbing and slowly releasing water during high rainfall, overland or river flows.  Recreation  Whangamarino is a popular duck hunting location and recreational fishers targeting koi carp, rudd, catfish, goldfish, eel and mullet are regularly seen in the wetland. Bow hunting for koi carp is increasing in popularity, while bird watching and kayaking are also commonly undertaken activities. 748 hectares of the wetland is owned by the Auckland/Waikato Fish and Game Council and thousands of gamebirds frequent the wetland annually, attracting hunters from Auckland and the greater Waikato area. The Fish and Game Council and gamebird hunters are working together with the Department of Conservation to improve wetland habitat and control predators around popular hunting sites.  Cultural importance  Whangamarino is located within the rohe (area) of the Waikato-Tainui iwi (tribe) and is considered a taonga (treasure) by local hapū. Early Māori utilised the wetland as a source of eel/tuna and birds for food, and flax/harakeke (Phormium tenax) for traditional cultural purposes. The rivers of the wetland were used for travel and recreation and the peat margins were used to preserve taonga such as waka, tools and weapons. Dense vegetation inhibited further use of the wetland, although it was used as a sanctuary during times of war. The Waikato War of 1863–1864 saw several major battles take place in the Whangamarino area, including the fierce land battle at Rangiriri. A small remnant of Rangiriri pā remains today; further north visitors can walk up a short track to Te Teoteo's pā and the Whangamarino Redoubt at the confluence of the Whangamarino and Waikato Rivers. Here, visitors can stand at the site where two forty-pound Armstrong guns fired on Māori entrenchments at Meremere pā and also obtain a good scenic view looking south over the northern part of the wetland.  Conservation management  Whangamarino Wetland has been subject to intensive biodiversity management, research, and community awareness campaigns by the Department of Conservation as part of the Arawai Kākāriki wetland restoration programme. Conservation measures taken to maintain or improve biodiversity include controlling weeds, particularly grey willow, aquatic grasses, yellow flag iris, alligator weed and gorse, and mammalian pests, including mustelids, rodents, cats and possum. The Whangamarino weir was repaired in 2010 and is now operating as it should to help maintain minimum summer water levels in the wetland. Fencing to exclude stock from wetland areas and restoration plantings have also taken place.

It crosses, at right angles, an ancient road that continues on to the Isle of Avalon. It consists of an embankment with a ditch on the east side. It is built across the ridge of land between Glastonbury and West Pennard. Both ends of the ditch and dyke disappear into moorland, formerly swamps. The current visible remains extend to just over 1 kilometer. It is bisected by the A361 and crossed by three public footpaths. The gap where the road runs through the dyke is staggered, suggesting that the gap is original. It was excavated in 1909 by Arthur Bulleid, and again in 1970 by Peter Poyntz Wright and the Glastonbury Antiquarian Society. Bulleid's excavation just north of the road revealed that the bank was 9 feet high and made of layers of yellow and grey clay, while the ditch was 12 feet deep in hard blue marl. Neither excavation found significant objects with the exception of fragmentary pottery of prehistoric and medieval origin. Interpretation of the site is not clear. It is possible that it was part of a longer defensive barrier associated with New Ditch three miles to the south-west which is built in a similar manner. It has been suggested that it is part of a great Celtic sanctuary, probably 3rd century B.C., while others date it to the post-Roman period and connect it with the Dark Age occupation on Glastonbury Tor. The 1970 excavation suggests the 12th century or later. It is also claimed that Ponter’s Ball delineates the long single horn on the head of the Capricorn effigy in the Temple of the Stars, an alleged ancient temple thought to be situated around Glastonbury. The name Ponter's Ball is said to be derived from \\"pontis vallum\\", Latin meaning \\"the bridge over the ditch.\\" In the early 19th century it was called Ponting's Ball and by 1876 Fronter's Ball.

The Peacham drawing, or 'Longleat manuscript', is the only surviving contemporary Shakespearean illustration, now in the library of the Marquess of Bath at Longleat. The drawing appears to depict a performance of Titus Andronicus, under which is quoted some dialogue. Eugene M. Waith argues of the illustration that \\"the gestures and costumes give us a more vivid impression of the visual impact of Elizabethan acting than we get from any other source.\\"Eugene M. Waith (ed.) Titus Andronicus (The Oxford Shakespeare; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), 27 In the sketch, Tamora (Queen of the Goths in the play) is shown pleading with her captor, Titus (a renowned general in the Roman army). Behind her, kneel her sons, Chiron and Demetrius, their hands tied behind their backs, and behind them stands Aaron (a Moor involved in a secret sexual relationship with Tamora), who is armed and pointing at them. Behind Titus are two male figures who may be two of his sons, but due to their dress, are more likely to be attendant soldiers. The illustration depicts no one specific moment from the play. In Act 1, Titus decides to avenge the death of his own sons in battle by sacrificing Tamora's eldest son, Alarbus, prompting her to plead with him for her son's life, which is what she is pictured doing in the illustration. In the play, however, when Tamora is pleading with Titus for the release of Alarbus (who isn't present in the illustration), Aaron is still a prisoner. In the illustration, he is free and armed. It may be this sword is not a literal one but instead was meant by the illustrator to be a sword of lath (a prop associated with the Vice figure of medieval morality plays), as a way of showing Aaron's villainy.Christopher Crosbie, \\"The Longleat Manuscript Reconsidered: Shakespeare and the Sword of Lath\\", English Literary Renaissance, 44:2 (Spring, 2014), 221-240 Beneath the illustration and above the text is written a stage direction; \\"Enter Tamora pleadinge for her sonnes going to execution.\\" This is an invented stage direction, not found in any known text of the play. Below this, lines from Act 1 (Tamora's plea to Titus; 1.1.104-120 and one line of Titus' reply; 1.1.121) and Act 5 (Aaron's boast of his many vile deeds; 5.1.125-144) are quoted. After the final line of Aaron is written \\"et cetera\\" and below, written as a speech prefix is \\"Alarbus\\", although he has no lines in the play itself. The illustration is signed in the lower left, \\"Henricus Peacham\\". Below the signature is a date; \\"Anno moqogqto.\\" There is no definitive theory as to the exact form of this date. The most common interpretation is 1595, partly due to an inscription on the facing page reading \\"Henrye Peachams Hande 1595\\". However, this note appears to have been written by John Payne Collier, notorious Shakespearean forger, and as such cannot be seen as wholly reliable. Another annotation is written above the illustration; \\"Written by Henry Peacham – author of 'The Complete Gentleman'.\\" This is also thought to be by Collier.Eugene M. Waith (ed.) Titus Andronicus (The Oxford Shakespeare; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), 23 Yet another annotation is found opposite the quote from Act 1; \\"So far from Shakespear Titus Andronicus Sc. 2.\\" This may also be by Collier as it refers to a scene division found only in his edition of the play. There are also some points of interest in the quoted text itself. There are many simple spelling alterations from the printed editions of Titus, but what is especially interesting is that some of them correspond to the first quarto text published in 1594 (Q1); some to the second quarto text, published in 1600 (Q2); some to the third, published in 1611 (Q3); and some to the First Folio text of 1623 (F1). For example, in Q1, the word \\"Haystacks\\" is spelt \\"Haystalks\\", in Q2 it is \\"haystakes\\" and in Q3 and F1, \\"haystackes\\". In the quoted text, the Q3/F1 spelling of \\"haystackes\\" is used, suggesting the text was transcribed no earlier than 1611. However, another change is \\"But\\" altered to \\"Tut\\". This was a change introduced into the text in Q2, and maintained in Q3 and F1, and some take it as evidence that the illustration cannot be earlier than Q2 (1600). Another change is the alteration of \\"sonne\\" to \\"sonnes\\" twice during Tamora's speech (line 106 and 108), although the singular \\"sonne\\" is maintained later. The invented stage direction also uses the plural \\"sonnes\\". Only F1 uses the plural form at line 106, in what is obviously a compositors error; but why did Peacham use it, as he must have noticed the error. Was he copying from F1, and if so, how did his other alterations have come about? If the drawing was made in 1595, how is it that some of the alterations to the text correspond exactly to later editions of the play? These questions remain unanswered. To add to the lack of definitive information, June Schlueter believes the Peacham drawing does not depict Titus at all, but a 1620 German version of the play entitled Eine sehr klägliche Tragaedia von Tito Andronico. Schlueter points out that the drawing perfectly illustrates the conclusion of Act 1 of Tito Andronico.June Schlueter, \\"Rereading the Peacham Drawing\\", Shakespeare Quarterly, 50:2 (Summer, 1999), 171-184 At least one major Shakespearean scholar, Brian Vickers, supports Schlueter's arguments.Brian Vickers, Shakespeare, Co-Author: A Historical Study of Five Collaborative Plays (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), 149-150 Richard Levin, however, argues against many of Schlueter's claims, and affirms that the drawing is a contemporary \\"composite\\" reading of Shakespeare's tragedy.Levin, Richard Lewis. \\"The Longleat Manuscript and Titus Andronicus\\", Shakespeare Quarterly, 53:3 (Autumn, 2002), 323-340 Citations Further reading * Bate, Jonathan (ed.)

It consisted of Carlos Iturbide (guitar, vocals), Juan Carlos Saporiti \\"Juancho\\" (drums) and Anibal Tell 'Lolo' (bass). In 1970, when the trend of singing in English language in Latin America had little acceptance, they released their first album made only of cover versions called Estoy Herido through Odeon Records, with the track list ranging from \\"Río Verde\\" (\\"Green River\\") by Creedence Clearwater Revival to \\"Enciende mi Fuego\\" (\\"Light My Fire\\") by The Doors, under the genre that would become known as soul rock. Iturbide had a raspy voice, which was the band's signature trademark. In 1971, they released an album called Galleta Soul. Their influences on this album were Otis Redding, James Brown, Ray Charles, Stax, Wilson Pickett, Johnnie Taylor, Motown, Jeff Beck Group, Bill Deal and the Rhondels, Steve Cropper, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Southern Soul and Small Faces. Eight of the twelve songs were written by Iturbide and Conte (who were responsible for the lyrics). On the back cover of the album was written that their lyrics ranged from subjects concerning LSD to racial issues. As a final attempt, in 1975 Iturbide decided to continue the project and reformulated the band's line-up, now a quartet, to include Eduardo Sanz, as a guitarist, Lito Olmos, on bass, and Maria José, on drums. Now just called Galleta, the new self-titled album of the band hits the stores in 1975. The soul rock was still the main genre, but now they started to play hard rock covers of some songs of the British band Ten Years After. In 1975, when it was a turbulent time in Latin America, the album was not warmly received. In Brazil, Iturbide is considered one of the idols of this genre coming from Argentina. One of the band's hits was the song \\"I Am So Happy.\\" They influenced the Brazilian band The Fevers. In the 21st-century the band's songs continue to be re-recorded and concerts are made in their tribute.

The primary function of the Metra Police Department is to protect Metra passengers, employees, assets (trains and stations), enforce criminal laws, traffic laws and ordinances that directly or indirectly relate to the Metra system. Metra police officers are fully sworn officers just like the officers of any municipal police department, responsible for the safety and security of the Metra system in a six-county service area – Cook, Will, DuPage, Kane, McHenry and Lake counties.  History A Ford Police Interceptor Utility of Metra Police In 1974 the Illinois State Legislature created the Regional Transportation Authority. When the RTA reorganized in 1983, Metra was created. This act empowers all the sub units of the RTA to establish and maintain police forces. The Metra Police Department was created at that time. The RTA Act states that these police departments have the authority of municipal police officers. The main focus of department is the six-county transit operation, however due to the great distances between rail lines, off-property arrests occur on a regular basis. All Metra police officers are fully certified police officers. Because of the six counties of police operation, tickets and criminal complaints are booked into many different courts. As a general rule, court cases are assigned in the nearest court, in the county of arrest. Safety is an important part of this function, and preventing accidents and injuries are a focus of the department. Many times enforcing traffic laws around Metra stations and crossings is intended to increase awareness and citizen compliance. Metra Police work in cooperation with local authorities to reduce or attempt to prevent hazardous conditions or blatant violations of the law which result in an unsafe condition. Metra Police routinely assist local, county and state agencies in non Metra related matters. The jurisdiction of the Metra Police extends well past the property owned or leased by Metra. A Metra Police patrol car. In 2008, the department began using a computer-aided dispatch system and new electronic report writing system. In January 2014, an investigative report by the Chicago-based security consulting firm Hillard Heintze blasted the department as being \\"antiquated\\" and beset with excessive overtime and staffing problems. The 114-page report sketched an alarming portrait of law enforcement standards on the Metra system. It detailed myriad concerns about the agency's training, counter terrorism efforts and commitment to passenger safety. According to the report, the department averages less than one arrest per day. In May 2014, Joseph Perez was appointed Chief of the Metra Police Department. Perez was selected from a field of 12 candidates after 68 applied for the job.  Homeland Security Unit  After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Metra Police Department increased its effort in anti- terrorism concerns. The Homeland Security Unit (formally Special Operations Unit) concentrates on protecting passengers and Metra terminals throughout the system. Officers have been assigned to the Chicago Police Fusion Center (CPIC), and the Illinois State Police Statewide Terrorism Information Center (STIC). Metra Police officers regularly participate in the Chicago Police CAPS program. Metra Police regularly participate in Chicago Office of Emergency Communications (OEMC) planning meetings for large events.  Fallen officer  One METRA officer has died in the line of duty. On September 27, 2006 Metra Officer Thomas A. Cook was killed in the line of duty while working a robbery prevention detail near the 147th Street/Sibley Station in Harvey, Illinois.

The book was published on 22 November 2011. The novel was referenced in an October 2010 interview, in which Connelly indicated that he'd like to release \\"'bookend' novels next year, the second one a Bosch book\\".\\"Crime writer Michael Connelly builds in the fear factor,\\" Colette Bancroft, TampaBay.com, 17 October 2010 Connelly's first novel of 2011 was the Mickey Haller novel The Fifth Witness. The plot finds Bosch juggling two investigations: one an old cold-case murder that was reactivated by a new lead from DNA evidence, and the other the death of a politically-connected power broker in a fall from a hotel balcony. Plot The book was mentioned in a February 2011 interview, where Connelly explained that Bosch would be \\"handling two cases at once, a cold case that turns hot and the politically charged investigation into the death of a city councilman's son. The city councilman happens to be Harry's old nemesis, Irvin Irving.\\"The Fifth Witness Q & A With Michael Connelly, MichaelConnelly.com, February 2011 Bosch and his partner David Chu are working in the Open-Unsolved unit of the LAPD's homicide squad handling cold cases. Based on a new analysis of old physical evidence, they are assigned to investigate the 1989 murder of college student Lily Price who was strangled to death, probably with a belt. DNA from a small blood smear on her body is matched to recently-paroled child sex abuser Clayton Pell. However Pell was only eight years old when Price died, all but eliminating him as a suspect in the murder and raising the possibility of contamination at the crime lab. Bosch and Chu track Pell to a halfway house for sex offenders, where they meet therapist Hannah Stone. Due to his experience with sexual homicides Bosch is initially dismissive of Stone's professional efforts. However, he soon reconsiders and decides Stone's attempts to help offenders reduce their recidivism rate is a worthwhile career. Pell agrees to an interview, reporting that during his childhood his mother dated a man known as \\"Chill\\" who sexually abused him and beat him with a belt -- accounting for the transfer of his blood to Price's body. Bosch and Stone are attracted to each other, and begin a romantic relationship, much to the approval of Bosch's teenage daughter Maddie. After years of living alone, Bosch gained custody of Maddie after her mother's death. She demonstrates keen observational skills and expresses an interest in being a police officer. The Price investigation is sidetracked by the death of attorney and business consultant George Irving in a fall from a hotel room balcony at Chateau Marmont. George is the son of Irvin Irving, formerly Bosch's nemesis at LAPD, now a city council member and Bosch's frequent foe in power struggles and political gamesmanship. Irving specifically requests Bosch to investigate his son's death because, despite their personal antipathy, he believes Bosch is a dedicated detective who will find out the truth no matter what. Due to some unusual marks on George's body indicating he'd been in a choke hold shortly before his death, Bosch initially suspects homicide. He hypothesizes that the death came as part of a scheme to discredit a company that was in competition for a highly lucrative city- approved taxi license. Soon after George took on one taxi company as a client, their competing company was faced with numerous traffic citations that appeared to have been orchestrated by George Irving. Some of Irvin's old enemies stand to suffer financial losses in the taxi license disputes. Bosch believes a former police officer and now co-owner of a taxi company sneaked into George's room and incapacitated him before tossing the body from the balcony. Chu leaks details of the case to a reporter at the Los Angeles Times in a misguided attempt to impress her, enraging Bosch and making him question Chu's integrity. However, additional investigation reveals that George killed himself. George Irving was assaulted, but it occurred hours before his death. The suspect intended to confront George about the taxi scheme, but discovered George's suicidal plan and incapacitated him with a choke hold to flee the scene. In addition to this discovery, more details about George's life begin to come to light. George Irving's only friendship had ended as a result of his backroom political dealing, he was experiencing depression caused by his son leaving for college, and his marriage was ending. In fact, he rented the same hotel room where he and his wife spent their honeymoon. George's wife had concealed this detail out of shame and to protect their son from the ugly truth. Irvin Irving refuses to believe Bosch's findings, leading to a showdown meeting with city and police leaders where Bosch implicates Irving in the taxi-license scheme and Irving demands a review of Bosch. Bosch and Chu return to the Price investigation, identifying \\"Chill\\" as Chilton Hardy, Jr., a man with a minor criminal history. Based on Price being strangled with a belt, and Pell's story of Hardy beating him with a belt, they think Hardy is a strong suspect for the Price murder. They track down Hardy's ailing father at a townhouse, and he claims to have no idea where his son might be. A brief search of the townhouse finds evidence that Hardy killed his father and has stolen his identity. Upon arrest, Hardy admits his identity and confesses to the Price murder along with 36 other homicides. A search of the adjacent townhouse, also registered to Hardy's father, finds evidence of Hardy's crimes including photographs and home movies of his rapes. A task force is convened to handle the massive amounts of evidence in the townhouse, and to deal with the inevitable criticism of Hardy's crimes going undiscovered for decades. Pell orchestrates a revenge scheme after learning that Hardy will never be charged for his child sex abuse. Pell attacks a police officer and is sent to the same jail where Hardy is being held. As both men are transferred on a bus to court for arraignment hearings, Pell attacks and seriously wounds Hardy. Bosch intuits Pell's scheme and saves Hardy's life, but later wonders if he should have let Pell kill Hardy. Bosch receives a warning from his former partner Kiz Rider who now works as an assistant to the LAPD chief: the Hardy case must be delayed until after an upcoming election, in efforts to prevent Irving from being re-elected. Irving's many political enemies want to see him defeated; they hope the taxi-licensing scandal will harm his prospects and want to temporarily suppress the Hardy case to keep the taxi scandal in the news. Bosch finds such political maneuvering distasteful, but knows it's part of the job and feels content knowing Hardy will never be free. Bosch and Chu eventually reconcile, after Bosch's temper cools and Chu makes some impressive discoveries during the investigations and also comes to Bosch's defense during the showdown with Irving. \\"Like His Creator, a Busy Guy\\", New York Times, November 23, 2011.

Early life Tabbert was born on October 5, 1919, in Chicago, Illinois,Cook County birth recordsSocial Security Death Index the second son of William Frank and Edith Victoria (née Johnson) Tabbert. His father was the son of German immigrants and supported his family working as a railroad engineer. His mother was the daughter of Swedish immigrants who had settled in Minnesota during the 1880s.1900-1910-1920-1930 US Census records By 1930, though both their parents were still alive, William and his older brother Spencer were residents of Lawrence Hall, a Chicago institution that sheltered homeless and orphaned boys. Spencer would go on to serve in the army during the Second World War,U.S. World War II Army Enlistment Records, 1938-1946 while a bout of pneumonia ended William's brief military service. Career Tabbert's road to Broadway began during his senior year at Chicago's Hirsch high school when he won a three-year scholarship sponsored by the Chicago Daily Tribune to study grand opera with soprano Anna Fitziu. During his high school years Tabbert was active as a baritone singer at school events and as a contestant in several community talent contests. After his graduation in 1939 Tabbert supported himself as he studied music by performing small parts with the Chicago Civic Opera Company and singing at local area night spots.The New York Times, October 22, 1974 In 1941 Tabbert married dancer Evelyn Rainey and began to think about expanding his career. The war intervened though, forcing him to put his plans on hold until after being discharged from the army and recovering his health. Broadway during the war, like most other war era industries, was suffering a manpower shortage which, starting in 1943, opened the door for Tabbert to appear in musicals like, What's Up?, Follow the Girls, Seven Lively Arts, Billion Dollar Baby and Three to Make Ready. After the success of the long running South Pacific, Tabbert returned to singing at night clubs and appeared regularly on radio and television shows such as The Ed Sullivan Show, The Voice of Firestone and Armstrong Circle Theater. In 1954 he hosted the Bill Tabbert Show for ABC television and that same year made his final Broadway appearance in Fanny with Ezio Pinza, Walter Slezak and Florence Henderson.IBDb.com Of his performance, critic Brooks Atkinson wrote: \\"Mr. Tabbert pours his familiar vitality into a sort of sea spiritual called \\"Restless Heart\\" and a song of despair entitled \\"Fanny\\". Tabbert was a regular performer at summer evening concerts held at City College of New York's Lewisohn Stadium and in musical theatrical production performed across the country. Death Bill Tabbert died of a massive brain hemorrhage on October 18, 1974, in New York City while rehearsing for an upcoming show.

It was visited by the Lewis and Clark Expedition on their way up the Missouri River in 1804; nearby, they discovered a colony of prairie dogs, an animal previously unknown to scientists. For its connection with Lewis and Clark, and because it has little changed since their passage in 1804, the site was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description Old Baldy is located about north of Lynch, Nebraska, and about half a mile (about a kilometer) south of the Missouri River. It is part of a line of bluffs at the southern edge of the Missouri valley; it rises an additional above the surrounding highlands, reaching an elevation of above sea level. The formation making up the hill is part of the Pierre Shale, deposited in the deep marine waters of the Western Interior Seaway during the Campanian and Maastrichtian ages of the late Cretaceous period, 70-80 million years ago. The Pierre consists chiefly of dark shale, but also contains chalky strata, one of which is exposed at the top of the hill. The chalk does not readily support plant growth, giving the hill its conspicuous bald appearance. History For many years before the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, Thomas Jefferson had contemplated seeking a water route from the United States to the Pacific Ocean. With the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from France, this could be done legally. Jefferson, now President of the United States, accordingly dispatched the Lewis and Clark Expedition up the Missouri River. The party was charged with following the main stem of the river to its headwaters and then finding rivers running westward from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific. They were also directed to establish peaceable relations with the indigenous peoples of the region; to note mineral and other resources; to map the major physiographic features; and to describe and collect specimens of the flora and fauna of the territory. On May 14, 1804, the party left its winter quarters at Camp Dubois, near the confluence of the Missouri and the Mississippi River. On July 21, it reached the mouth of the Platte River; on September 4, the mouth of the Niobrara River. On September 7, 1804, the two captains left the boats to explore the conspicuous bald hill, which they had seen from the river the day before. They climbed to the summit and measured its height as , and its base as . Black-tailed prairie dog In descending the hill, the explorers discovered a colony of prairie dogs, an animal then unknown to science, though known to French explorers. To secure specimens, Lewis and Clark summoned other members of the party from the boat. They were able to shoot one, \\"which was cooked for the Capts dinner\\", but wanted a live animal. An attempt to dig one out of its burrow proved unsuccessful: after digging through hard clay, the men thrust a pole down the hole and discovered that they were less than halfway to the bottom. The party then attempted to flood an animal out, which also proved no small task: \\"we por'd into one of the holes 5 barrels of water without filling it.\\" Although they worked until nightfall, they only succeeded in flushing out and capturing a single prairie dog. The prairie dog survived the trip up the river to the expedition's winter camp at Fort Mandan, near the mouth of the Knife River in present-day North Dakota. On April 7, 1805, the expedition's keelboat was dispatched back down the Missouri to St. Louis, carrying a collection of specimens including six living animals: a sharp-tailed grouse, four magpies, and the prairie dog. The grouse apparently died between St. Louis and New Orleans, and three of the magpies did not survive the trip from New Orleans to Baltimore. On October 4, the prairie dog and the surviving magpie were inspected by President Jefferson in Washington, D.C. They were then sent to Charles Willson Peale for his museum in Philadelphia. The prairie dog is known to have survived at least until April 1806. As a conspicuous and recognizable landmark, Old Baldy was used by surveyors operating in this region of Nebraska and South Dakota. In particular, it was used by Lieutenant J. C. Clark (apparently unrelated to William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition) in an 1860 survey to lay out the boundary of the Fort Randall Military Reservation. In 1948, the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey established a triangulation station named \\"Lynch\\" atop a hill located just north of Old Baldy; the northern hill is of about the same height, but is not devoid of vegetation. Promotion and protection For communities along the Missouri River in eastern Nebraska, the 2004 bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition was an opportunity to promote tourism. It was estimated that as many as 40 million people might travel to parts of the Corps of Discovery's route in that year. The residents of Lynch used the prairie-dog episode as a focus for tourism promotion. Although the animals are generally regarded as pests by farmers and ranchers, it was thought that the story of their discovery might draw visitors specifically to the area. To fund Lewis and Clark-related projects, the city sold stuffed fabric prairie dogs made by local volunteers and dubbed \\"Lynch Dawgs\\". A Lynch restaurateur also installed a chainsaw sculpture of a prairie dog outside of his establishment. Tourist promotion of Old Baldy continued after the Lewis and Clark bicentennial. In 2004, an area of about including Old Baldy was placed on the National Register of Historic Places under the name \\"the Tower\\". The site was nominated for its connection to Lewis and Clark; it was noted that the surrounding prairie and burr oak woodlands were little altered since 1804. In 2005, a conservation easement was purchased covering including the hill. The site is on private land, but can be viewed from an overlook with an interpretive sign off a nearby county road.

It concerns the goings-on at a private country club. Plot summary Following the Tony-nominated revival of Lend Me a Tenor on Broadway, Ken Ludwig's new play, A Fox On the Fairway, debuted at the Signature Theatre in Washington, D.C. on October 19, 2010. A tribute to the great English farces of the 1930s and 1940s, A Fox On the Fairway takes audiences on a hilarious romp which pulls the rug out from underneath the stuffy denizens of a private country club. Filled with mistaken identities, slamming doors, and over-the-top romantic shenanigans, it's a furiously paced comedy that recalls the Marx Brothers' classics. Productions and reviews The play premiered at the Signature Theatre, Arlington, Virginia, in October 2010. Directed by John Rando, the cast featured Jeff McCarthy, Holly Twyford and Andrew Long.Jones, Kenneth. \\"Ken Ludwig's New Comedy, 'Fox on the Fairway', Opens at Arlington's Signature; John Rando Directs\\" Playbill, October 24, 2010 The play was described by the Washington Post critic Peter Marks as \\"Ludwig's tribute to the great English farces of the 1930s and 1940s\\". Peter Marks found the plot mechanical and the play too full of \\"shamelessly recycled sex, sports and alcohol jokes.\\" Paul Harris called it \\"a manic race to the intellectual depths propelled by a nonsensical tale of greed, love and stupidity.\\" The second production was presented at the George Street Playhouse, New Brunswick, New Jersey, running from March 22, 2011 (previews) to April 22. Directed by David Saint, the cast featured Amy Hohn, Michael Mastro, Peter Scolari, Mary Testa, Reggie Gowland and Lisa McCormick.Gans, Andrew. \\"Ken Ludwig's 'Fox on the Fairway', with Mary Testa, Peter Scolari, Begins George Street Run March 22\\" Playbill, March 22, 2011 This production received a more positive reaction by the critics. Michael Summers found \\"plenty of bright spots\\", although he also bemoaned a mechanical plot. Peter Filichia described it as \\"phenomenally funny\\" and thought it better than Ludwig's Lend Me a Tenor. The third production was mounted in March, 2012 at Gulfshore Playhouse in Naples, Florida. Chris Silk in the Naples Daily News said, \\"Gulfshore Playhouse knocked one straight off the tee and hit a hole in one Friday. Farce 'The Fox on the Fairway,' which mixes golf, romance and fashion keeps the audience in stitches.

Hill served as the head football coach at San Jose State University from 2001 to 2004, compiling a record of 14–33. He was the president of Arkansas Baptist College from 2006 to 2016. Early life The youngest of three brothers, Fitz Hill was born and raised in Arkadelphia, Arkansas. His father James routinely worked 14-hour days as a production manager at Arkadelphia Beverage Company in the daytime and janitor in the nighttime. His mother Mary was a high school registrar and volunteered with local children and college students at her church. As a student, Hill was elected class president of Arkadelphia High School. College playing career Hill earned an athletic scholarship to Northeast Louisiana University (now the University of Louisiana at Monroe), then a Division I-AA school, playing wide receiver on the Northeast Louisiana Indians football team. In 1983, while a college freshman, Hill's father died of stomach cancer. Six weeks later, Hill's mother had an aneurysm and later a stroke that left her partially paralyzed and unable to speak. Hill left Northeastern Louisiana and returned to Arkadelphia to help take care of his mother, who died in 2009. Hill transferred to Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia. To pay for school, Hill managed a shoe repair store and joined the Army ROTC. Hill also founded a coin-op laundromat in 1986 and would manage it until 1996. He continued to play football and was a NAIA All-American in 1985 and 1986. He graduated in 1987 with a double major B.A. in communications and physical education. He received a master's degree in Student Personnel Services from Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana, where he served as a graduate assistant football coach during the 1988 football season.Fitz Hill Named President of Arkansas Baptist College, Arkansas Business, January 27, 2006, accessed August 1, 2013. Military career During the early years of his coaching career, Hill's career was briefly interrupted by military service during the Gulf War, where he was a transportation officer. He coordinated the transportation of rations and supplies to American troops participating in Desert Shield and Desert Storm; during this time he was promoted to first lieutenant and received the Bronze Star and Commendation Medal. Coaching career =Early coaching career (1987–1988)= After graduating from Ouachita Baptist University, Hill returned to Arkadelphia High School in 1987 as an assistant football coach. In 1988, Hill enrolled at Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana and was a graduate assistant on the Northwestern State Demons football team. =Arkansas (1989–2000)= Hill transferred to the University of Arkansas in 1989 and became a graduate assistant for the Arkansas Razorbacks football team. In the spring of 1990, Hill returned to Northwestern State University and served as quarterbacks and wide receivers coach for that term. While completing his master's degree at Northwestern State, Hill continued to be a volunteer assistant coach for Arkansas in 1990 and 1991. Hill graduated from Northwestern State with a Master of Arts degree in student personnel services in 1991. In the spring of 1992, Hill served as wide receivers coach for Utah State University. He later returned to the University of Arkansas as wide receivers coach for the 1992 regular season. Immediately after losing the season opener to Division I-AA The Citadel, Arkansas athletic director Frank Broyles fired head coach Jack Crowe. Fellow assistant coach Houston Nutt reflected on that time in the season: \\"The thing that was so tough that year was the uncertainty you felt every single day. As an assistant, you're thinking, 'Am I going to be here after this season? Am I going to have to get another job?'\\" In 2012, Hill said that Broyles \\"felt a change was necessary not so much for the team, but for public perception\\" after the loss to The Citadel. Hill remained on the staff of interim head coach Joe Kines and was retained by permanent head coach Danny Ford in 1993. Hill continued to be wide receivers coach until 2000. In 1998, under new head coach Houston Nutt, Hill added recruiting coordinator to his duties. In 2000, Hill became assistant head coach as well. During Hill's time at Arkansas as wide receivers coach, Arkansas made the AP Top 25 poll in 1995, 1998, and 1999, with the #16 spot in the 1998 final AP poll and #17 in the 1999 final AP poll. Arkansas won the 2000 Cotton Bowl Classic following its 1999 season and appeared in the December 1995 Carquest Bowl, 1999 Florida Citrus Bowl (after the 1998 season), and 2000 Las Vegas Bowl.https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/arkansas/ In 1997, Hill received his Ed.D. from Arkansas; his doctoral thesis examined the \\"barriers restricting employment opportunities\\" for black coaches. =San Jose State (2001–2004)= 2001 season In December 2000, Hill was hired as the head coach for the San Jose State University Spartans football team. Hill became the 17th black coach in Division I-A football and one of the few I-A coaches with a doctorate.Richard Lapchick, Fitz Hill still recruiting, coaching, leading, ESPN.com, May 6, 2011, accessed August 1, 2013. When Hill was hired, the San Jose State athletic department was in financial trouble and ranked 106th out of 114 Division I-A schools in football home game attendance, with an average attendance of about 12,000. The financial issues forced San Jose State to schedule numerous road games against schools in BCS Automatic Qualifier conferences during Hill's tenure, including USC, Florida, and Ohio State. In Hill's first season as head coach, San Jose State finished 3–9 in 2001.https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/coaches/fitz-hill-1.html For the season, average home game attendance fell to about 10,000 in a 30,000-seat Spartan Stadium. This put San Jose State's Division I-A status in jeopardy because the NCAA passed a new requirement in 2002 requiring average home game attendance to be at least 15,000. 2002 season San Jose State improved to 6–7 in 2002 albeit one win short of bowl eligibility, in a season with 9 of the 13 games on the road.https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/san- jose-state/2002-schedule.html The season began with a 33-14 win in Little Rock, Arkansas over Arkansas State, in a homecoming of sorts for Fitz Hill. By October 5, San Jose State reached a 4-2 record, including a win over defending Big Ten champion Illinois. However, San Jose State went 2-5 in the final seven games of the season. In the regular season finale, a rivalry game against Fresno State, San Jose State lost 19-16. Fresno State scored 10 points off San Jose State turnovers, specifically a botched punt and interception. Hill was criticized for not running out the clock with 1:32 left in the second quarter and San Jose State with a ten-point lead, since the botched punt occurred in the last minute of the second quarter. Another questionable play call was a running play on fourth-and-one with San Jose State leading 16-13 early in the fourth quarter. Sidebar: \\" Players don't fault Hill for taking chances.\\" 2003 season In March 2003, Hill achieved a two-year effort to schedule a season opener against Grambling State, a historically black university in Louisiana. The game was dubbed the Dr. Martin Luther King Literacy Classic, which shares a namesake with the new library to be opened on the San Jose State campus. Profits from the game would benefit literacy programs. Hill said that he thought the game would succeed because the Bay Area had a large base of Grambling State alumni. In the Spartans' first shutout since 1988, San Jose State beat Grambling State 29-0 in a sellout game that featured the Grambling State marching band at halftime. Sidebar: \\" All around, opener proclaimed a success.\\" However, San Jose State then finished its 2003 season 3–8. Among its 8 losses were a 13-10 loss to Hawaii in which San Jose State came up one yard short in attempting a game-winning touchdown. With 20 seconds left and the Spartans at the Hawaii 5, the San Jose State offensive coordinator called a time-consuming screen pass to tight end Courtney Anderson, who was tackled at the one-yard line. Scott Rislov attempted to spike the ball to stop the clock with 2 seconds to go, but referees declared the game over. In the season finale on November 22, San Jose State lost 34-32 to Tulsa. The Spartans failed on a game-tying two-point conversion with 5:59 left in the game. On their final drive, the Spartans also could not convert a fourth-and-1 from their own 49. The graduation rate for San Jose State football players improved to 36 percent for the 2003–04 academic year, compared to 17 percent in 2001–02 and 21 percent in 2002–03. However, this rate was the worst among the three Division I-A California State University football programs (Fresno State and San Diego State) and trailed graduation rates for all San Jose State student- athletes and the general student body. 2004 season With rising costs of Division I-A football, dwindling attendance for home games, and budget cuts affecting the university, a movement began in the spring of 2004 among San Jose State faculty calling for the football program to withdraw from Division I-A. To follow the successful Literacy Classic from 2003, Hill organized a similar game, dubbed the Read-2-Lead Classic, surrounding the 2004 home opener against Morgan State, like Grambling State a historically black university. San Jose State hosted events leading up to this game, including a discussion about education with Fitz Hill and Bill Cosby. Boyz II Men also performed the national anthem before the game. Although San Jose State won 47-28, only around 11,000 attended the Read-2-Lead Classic, in comparison with the 2003 Literacy Classic attracting a sellout crowd of over 30,000. San Jose State finished the season 2–9; Hill left San Jose State with an overall 14–33 record. The season included a 70-63 victory over Rice in which the total score broke an NCAA record for combined points in a non-overtime game. Also, San Jose State lost in double overtime to AP 14th-ranked Boise State, after a potential game-winning field goal late in the 4th quarter was blocked. On November 22, 2004, before the final game of the season, Hill announced that he would resign from San Jose State after season's end, at the request of interim university president Don Kassing. Since 2003, when the NCAA introduced the Academic Progress Rate (APR), San Jose State football posted APR scores that failed to reach the baseline 925 because student-athletes recruited by Hill either failed to graduate or became academically ineligible for the football team. As a result, in 2006, the NCAA took away scholarships from San Jose State football. It took until 2010 for San Jose State's multiyear APR to rise above 925 and for the program to be allocated the full 85 scholarships. Executive career Hill returned to Arkansas in December 2004, becoming executive director of the Ouachita Opportunity Fund at Ouachita Baptist University as well as co-founder and co-general manager of Life Champs Sports, a youth sports program headquartered in Little Rock.Lindsey Irvin, Meet the Neighbors: Dr. Fitz Hill of Little Rock, InArkansas.com, July 11, 2011, accessed August 1, 2013. From 2004 to 2006, he was a visiting scholar and research associate at the University of Central Florida's DeVos Sport Business Management Program. During his time at San Jose State, Hill created the Delta Classic, a college football game between historically black colleges held annually in Little Rock, Arkansas.About Delta Classic 4 Literacy , Delta Classic 4 Literacy, accessed August 2, 2013. While raising support for the Delta Classic, Hill contacted Arkansas Baptist College (ABC) to speak with their president and found out they, at the time, did not have one. After giving his presentation on the Delta Classic to the school's board of trustees, they offered him the position of school president. On February 1, 2006, Hill became the 13th president of Arkansas Baptist College, succeeding Israel R. Dunn, Jr. At the time Hill took over at ABC, there was no salary budgeted to pay him and the school's enrollment had dipped to fewer than 200 students; the college was in danger of being stripped of its accreditation by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In five years, the school grew enrollment to 1,100 students, its budget $2 million to nearly $20 million, and kept its accreditation; Hill then drew a salary. Personal life Hill is a devout Christian. He married fellow Ouachita Baptist classmate, Cynthia Hill; she was born in Italy to an American military serviceman and an Italian mother. She received her doctorate not long after her husband and is currently in charge of Institutional Advancement at ABC. The couple has three children, Destiny, Faith, and Justice.

Completed in 2002, it is named after the Christian Feast of the Transfiguration of the Lord, celebrated on August 19. Construction Before the cathedral was built, services for Tolyatti's Auto Factory District were held in an ordinary flat in a conventional 16–storey apartment building on Yubileynaya (Jubilee) Street. Even then there was a sign on the door: \\"Cathedral of the Transfiguration\\". But, for services for the entire district, no more than two dozen people could be accommodated. In August 1991 (at the same time as the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt was unfolding), the Tolyatti town planning council made the decision to build a temple complex consisting of a baptismal church, a bell tower, and the Transfiguration Cathedral. The original intent was to place the cathedral on the banks of the Volga, but it was later decided to build it closer to the residential areas. The domes The chief architect was Dmitry Sokolo. Engineering drawings were developed by the Tolyatti companies Motor–Invest Ltd. and Hydroassembly. The construction was conducted by AvtoVAZ's Office of Capital Construction of Industrial Buildings and Structures with the direct involvement by Archpriest Valeriy Marchenko, rector of the Transfiguration Cathedral. Construction began in June 1992 with the erection of a church in honor of John the Baptist and the residences for the clergy. The erection of the cathedral proper began in 1996 and was completed in 2002. On August 19, 2002, Archbishop Sergius (Victor Poletkin), archbishop of the Samara and Syzran Diocese, consecrated the cathedral. Still unbuilt, and not planned to be built for several years, is the final part of the construction – the bell tower. According to the initial draft, it will be tall and will be provided with an elevator and observation deck. Architecture Chandelier The usable area of the cathedral is . The capacity exceeds 3,000 persons. The top of the main cross is above ground level. The cathedral includes the main altar in honor of the Transfiguration, the southern and northern altars, choirs, and the west porch, north and south porches, and the basement. The height of the iconostasis (icon wall) at the altar is . The floors are covered with mosaics of twelve kinds of marble. For the opening of the cathedral, Tolyatti jewelers provided sixteen enamel icons in silver frames. The interior and exterior are of carved oak brass fittings and grilles. The domes are covered with gold–plated stainless steel. The crosses are made of the same material. The central dome weighs 26 tons; its construction required the use of a special custom crane. The building is very modern from an engineering standpoint: the cathedral is equipped with radio broadcasting equipment, ventilation systems, a fire and burglar alarm system and other communications equipment, and outdoor floodlights. Activities In July 2006, the cathedral hosted one of the most important relics in the Christian world, the supposed right hand of John the Baptist.

Pen lines with the Gillott's name were manufactured in the British Pens factory of West Midlands,British Pens Limited overview on Companies House, UK Government and currently commercialised by William Mitchell Ltd, one of the brands of the corporation.Joseph Gillott on William Mitchell website History = Beginning and development = Joseph Gillott, founder Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, and Princess Alexandra at Gillott's Victoria Works, 1874 Advertisement, c. 1900 Gillot's 291 pens with their holder Joseph Gillott was a working cutler in his home town Sheffield, but in 1821 he moved to Birmingham, where he found employment in the steel toy trade, the technical name for the manufacture of steel buckles, chains and light ornamental steel-work generally. About 1830 he turned his attention to the manufacture of steel pens by machinery, and in 1831 patented a process for placing elongated points on the nibs of pens.Joseph Gillott Pen Maker Subsequently Gillott adapted the stamping press to the requirements of the manufacture, as cutting out the blanks, forming the slits, bending the metal, and impressing the maker's name on the pens. He also devised improved modes of preparing the metal for the action of the press, tempering, cleansing, and polishing, and, in short, many little details of manufacture necessary to give them the required flexibility to enable them to compete with the quill pen. One great difficulty to be overcome was their extreme hardness and stiffness; this was effected by making slits at the side in addition to the central one, which had previously been solely used. A further improvement, that of cross grinding the points, was subsequently adopted. The first gross of pens with three slits was sold for seven pounds. In 1830 the price was $2.00; in 1832, $1.50; in 1861, 12 cents, and a common variety for 4 cents a gross. The simplicity, accuracy, and readiness of the machinery employed enabled Gillott to produce steel pens in large quantities, and as he sold them at high prices he rapidly made a fortune. He ultimately employed 450 persons, who produced upwards of five tons per week, and the price was reduced from one shilling each to 4 pence a gross. His son, also Joseph, continued the family business of manufacturing steel pen nibs and continued to live in the Birmingham area, close to the large factory on Graham Street in the Jewellery Quarter, known as the Victoria Works.Joseph Gillott, pen maker = British Pens and present days = Nevertheless, the decreasing production of dip pens and the subsequent demise of the industry in Birmingham is often blamed on the invention of the ballpoint pen in 1938 by the Hungarian Laszlo Biro.\\"Pen makers: William Mitchell and Joseph Gillott\\", Birmingham Mail, 3 Nov 2014\\"A Brief History of Writing Instruments, Part 3: The Battle of the Ballpoint Pens\\" by Mary Bellis on About.com In 1920, when Hinks Wells & Co and William Mitchell came together at the Pedigree Works in Birmingham, founded a new company called \\"British Pens\\",Poole, Philip, and Michael Woods, letters to John Gwin, 1996-1998 which added Cumberland Pencils in 1921.

The plain is completely level with no particularly visible outlet for water, which occasionally floods the basin to a depth of several feet to form a lake. The creation of the lake is assisted by fountains that well up through a large chasm in the northwest and a smaller fissure in the southeast. It has also been noted that when the waters subside, they drain down these fissures. Investigative potholers have claimed a permanent stream flows underneath these fissures. The Chaff of Phiala The smaller southeastern fissure was investigated and found to be in diameter, to deep with no sign of water at the bottom. Robinson did not record any investigation of the larger one to the northwest of the plain, which was not flooded at the time, during the summer. The villagers suggest the underground stream leads to and is the original source and fountain of the Hasbani river, the most northern source of the Jordan river. This is notably similar to that described in the tale of \\"The Chaff of Phiala\\" in The Jewish War by Flavius Josephus. Josephus tells a geographically inaccurate tale of a cavern in an ancient place called Phiala or Phiale (modern Birkat Ram), discovered to be the initial source of the Jordan by Philip the Tetrarch of Trachonitis. He threw chaff into Phiala and found it was carried by the waters to Panium (modern Banias), previously thought to be the origin of the Jordan river. Josephus writes: Edward Robinson commented that this story would appear still current in respect to this chasm and underground stream leading to the Hasbani. Some neolithic flints have been recovered in this area, in the hills north of Rashaya. Roman temple Edward Robinson and Eli Smith visited in 1852 and noted a massive Roman temple had once been located near the village that has been grouped by George Taylor amongst the Temples of Mount Hermon. Robinson suggested the temple was bigger than Nebi Safa and spoke of it having been constructed of stones that were \\"tolerably large, well hewn, but not bevelled\\". Fragments of architrave, mouldings and blocks from the temple had been re-used by the villagers making their homes and farmsteads and had been left lying all over the fields, covered in rubbish. Sir Charles Warren also later visited and documented the area as part of an archaeological survey in 1869. He noted a long wall leading off into the east away from the village and temple. He also noted some vaults and rock-cut features and took a copy of an Ancient Greek inscription from one of the blocks. The temple was completed in 92 AD but only the western part remained when visited, located on the top of a hill overlooking the plain. The temple was constructed of blue limestone with an entrance opening facing east and a sideways bearing of 78°30'. The base of the temples was described as Attic and was positioned on top of an socle. There were four courses of stones layered above a high, corniced stylobate, measuring , , and . Houses and a stable were built over the temple. Robinson also found a Corinthian frieze and judged the style of many of the blocks to be Corinthian in appearance. A stone with a Greek inscription was found built into the western wall. The structure measures wide by at least long with an entrance to vaults underneath. A column found nearby measured in diameter. Wildlife The white-eyed pochard was noted at the Aaiha lake (then called the Rashaya lake) by Nevins in 1955, but not in 1956 as the lake had reverted to being a plain that year. The duck is thought to have been driven off by frequent shooting. Nevins also noted the Eurasian teal as a resident in the winter, when the lake was present and the waters hadn't drained down the chasm to the Hasbani.

Simon's ideas of bounded rationality and satisficing. It was first developed in the early 1990s at the City University of New York. It has been used in game playing, robot pathfinding, recreational park design, spoken dialog systems, and solving NP-hard constraint satisfaction problems, and is general enough for many problem solving applications. Background =Bounded rationality= FORR does not have perfect knowledge of how to solve a problem, but instead learns from experience. Intelligent agents are not optimal, but make decisions based on only a subset of all possible good reasons and informative data. These agents can still be considered rational. This idea of bounded rationality was introduced by Herbert A. Simon,Simon, H.A. (1981) The Sciences of the Artificial who along with Allen Newell developed the early foundations of the study of cognitive architectures and also inspired early architectures such as Soar and ACT-R. =Multiple good reasons= FORR depends upon the idea that there are multiple reasons or rationales for performing actions while solving a problem. These reasons can be always right (it's always right to make a move in chess that will put the opponent in checkmate) or just sometimes right. The always-right reasons are the minority. The sometimes-right reasons can complete with each other: for example, in game playing, one good reason might be to capture pieces, while another might be to control some area of the board. In FORR, these competing reasons are called Advisors. The tiered Advisor system is general enough that any potential good reason, such as probabilistic, deductive, or perceptual can be implemented, so long as it gives advice on its preference of one action over another. Because of its reliance on a set of independent agents (the Advisors), FORR can be considered a connectionist architecture. The Architecture A FORR architecture has three components: a set of descriptives that describe the state of the problem, a tiered set of Advisors that are consulted in order to decide what action to perform, and a behavioral script that queries the Advisors and performs the action that they suggest.Epstein (1992) Capitalizing on Conflict: The FORR Architecture =Advisors= The Advisors are the set of rationales or heuristics for making a decision. They can be considered the procedural memory component of the architecture. Upon each new decision, Advisors are queried in order to decide which action to perform. Advisors never communicate with each other or learn on their own: they simply ask for information about the state of the problem stored in the form of descriptives, and make a suggestion based on that information. The Advisors are divided into three tiers, which are queried in the following order: * Tier 1: these Advisors are always right. If these suggest an action, that action is carried out immediately and the query ends. If they forbid an action, that action is removed from consideration. Otherwise, move to the next tier. * Tier 2: if one of these Advisors is triggered, it proposes a sub-problem, or an ordered set of actions, achieving a sub-goal in solving the overall problem (such as moving around one obstacle in a maze). If no tier 2 advisor is triggered, move to last tier. * Tier 3: these are all other rationales. They are not always right, but compete with each other. They vote on an action, and the highest-voted suggestion is performed. Different problem classes in the same domain will have different weights for the same Advisors, and the weights are developed from experience through learning algorithms. =Descriptives= The declarative memory component of the architecture, the descriptives represent the state of the problem and are available to any Advisor. =Behavioral script= The behavioral script queries each tier of Advisors sequentially. If a tier 1 Advisor suggests an action, the script performs the action. Otherwise, if a tier 2 Advisor is triggered, it means that a sub-problem has been encountered. A tier 1 Advisor guarantees that only one tier 2 Advisor is active at any time. If no tier 1 Advisor comments and no tier 2 Advisor is triggered, the behavioral script asks for suggestions or comments from all tier 3 Advisors and lets them vote. The script performs the action with the highest vote among all tier 3 advisors. Implementing a FORR architecture A problem domain is a set of similar problems, called the problem classes. If the problem domain is playing simple board games, then tic-tac-toe is a problem class, and one particular game of tic-tac-toe is a problem instance. If navigating a maze is the problem domain, then a particular maze is the class and one attempt at its navigation is an instance. Once the problem domain is identified, the implementation of a FORR architecture for that domain has two basic stages: finding possible right reasons (the Advisors) and learning their weights for a particular class. =How to build a FORR architecture= # Decide on a problem domain. # Use domain knowledge, surveys of the literature, intuition and good sense to enumerate a list of possible rationales for making a decision, which can be good or bad for different classes within the domain. These rationales are the Advisors. # Divide the Advisors into tiers: ## The Advisors that are always right are in Tier 1. For example, it's always right to make a winning move in a board game. ## The Advisors which identify a sub-problem go into Tier 2. For example, going around a wall in a maze. ## Every other Advisor is Tier 3. # Code the Advisors. Each Advisor returns a set of suggested actions along with weights for each suggested action. The weights are initially set to a uniform value, such as 0.05. # Identify all information about the state of the problem needed by all Advisors. These are the descriptives. Code these. # Code the behavioral script which queries the Advisors and performs the action they suggest. # Learn the weights for the Advisors on a set of particular problem instances in the Learning Phase using a Reinforcement learning algorithm. # Test the architecture on a set of previously unencountered problem instances. =Learning Advisor weights= The Advisors are the same for all problem classes in a domain, but the weights can be different for each class within the domain. Important heuristics for tic-tac-toe might not be important for a different board game. FORR learns the weights for its tier 3 Advisors by experience. Advisors that suggest an action resulting in failure have their weights penalized, and Advisors whose suggestions result in success have their weights increased. Learning algorithms vary between implementations.

The Spanish crown created institutions to facilitate the distribution of new knowledge. The Council of the Indies and the Casa de la Contratacion functioned as repositories of knowledge and constructed methodological guidelines for empirical research. Spanish physicians working in the New World provided detailed descriptions of the plants they encountered and conducted numerous experiments to determine the efficacy of these plants in treating diseases. While the discussion of natural history in the Scientific Revolution tends to focus on the research of Italian and English scholars, Spain was also engaged in an active pursuit of new knowledge about the natural world. However, the previously unknown nature of these plants forced an emphasis on empirical data as opposed to existing textual knowledge. Furthermore, the emphasis on profitability encouraged an emphasis on the commercial applications of new plants and influenced the manner in which these plants were described. Objectives The primary objective of Spanish exploration of New World flora was to discover commodities with commercial applications - specifically, spices and medicines. The sale of these products would finance further explorations. However, commercial concerns often intersected with the more practical issue of the health and welfare of the European explorers. Upon arrival in the New World, the Spaniards were confronted with diseases to which they had no prior exposure and no immunities. Many of the medicines the explorers had brought from Europe were ineffective in the treatment of New World diseases. Spanish physicians sought out local physicians in search of local medicines that would treat these “new” ailments. Production of Knowledge The emphasis on experience as a means of producing knowledge and verifying claims was an emerging trend in European natural history. In contrast to the established system that categorized new discoveries within the context of existing knowledge, this new approach emphasized firsthand experience to confirm that which had been recorded by ancient scholars such as Pliny, Dioscorides and Avicenna. The discovery of previously unknown plants and animals elevated the importance of experience and experiment. However, issues of authority and the verification of new knowledge continued to complicate the process. Because many of these plants were unknown to Europeans, the knowledge of native populations was necessary in order to identify useful plant material and determine proven remedies. What distinguished the New World efforts from those on the European continent was the increased dependence on empirical evidence to describe the commodities they encountered as well as the fact that this knowledge was constructed with the intent of exploiting potential commercial applications. With this in mind, unlike many of the natural history communities in other areas of Europe, the Spanish crown had considerable influence on the type of knowledge that was sought and the manner in which it was constructed. Hispaniola Balsam Egyptian balsam was known to European natural historians and was sought after for its healing properties. When Antonio de Villasante discovered a similar product in the New World there was immediate interest on the part of the Spanish crown. Villasante's “discovery” of balsam in the New World represented a possible source of a plant that was no longer readily available to European physicians. In 1528, Villasante “obtained permission from the crown to exploit balsam on the condition that he present before the Council of the Indies a long and very complete report about the tree to obtain the already mentioned liquor, and what its shape is and where this tree is found and what method is used to obtain the liquor; and similar [information] about other drugs”. The “discovery” of Hispaniola balsam by Antonio de Villasante illustrates the challenges of verifying the efficacy of New World resources and the ongoing debate within the natural history communities of Europe on how to classify new knowledge and how to place it within the existing body of medicinal knowledge. Villasante had identified a plant that appeared to possess the same qualities as the Egyptian balsam and had conducted numerous field experiments in order to ascertain the most efficient means of extracting the plants medicinal qualities. In his analysis of the plant, he suggested that over time “it may be shown by experience or reports from physicians whether it might be beneficial for other things”. This assumption on the part of Villasante that knowledge about the plant “was cumulative and would be based on the experience of physicians” was based upon the model set down by the Casa de la Contratacion and was the common approach to knowledge production in New World natural history. The idea of developing knowledge over time through continued experimentation and subsequent corrections to information later found to be erroneous was considered acceptable. This is In contrast to traditional Aristotelian methods that privileged existing texts. This difference in methodology caused friction within the community of physicians and natural historians who were concerned that lack of complete information could possibly be harmful to people who were treated with these new remedies. While Villasante based his knowledge of the plant on his own first hand observations and experiments as well as information provided to him by the native population, his observations were challenged by Licenciada Barreda, a Spanish physician. Barreda's report, published in 1529 focused primarily on the willingness of physicians in Spain to accept Villasante's claims without first conferring extensively with physicians in Santo Domingo. Barreda felt that confirmation of Villasante's findings and the determination of the accuracy of these findings should be the task of individuals with extensive experience with these plants, not the members of an organization in Spain that had commercial interests at stake. Barreda's concern about the validity of Villasante's claims in many ways echoes the concerns of Niccolo Leoniceno and the Ferrara debates between Leoniceno and Collenuccio. The obvious difference being that published information on the plant was nonexistent. This forced the debate into the realm of experiment and empirical knowledge. Specifically, physicians were forced to consider what constituted reliable data, who could be considered reliable sources and at what point they were comfortable in recommending the use of these new medicines for their patients. The Politics of Knowledge The challenge of pleasing an aristocratic patron was nothing new to Renaissance scholars and physicians. Competition for patronage was an ongoing struggle. Galileo's relationship with the Medici court provides a classic example of the need to communicate one's discoveries in a manner that conforms to social standards and reflects positively on the individuals or institutions sponsoring the work. However, unlike the Italians, Spanish explorers and physicians were dealing with a royal court that was more concerned with the discovery of products that would prove financially advantageous. While the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake was noble, the Spanish crown approached the discovery of new plants and animals from a primarily commercial perspective. This approach on the part of the Spanish crown was reflected in the manner in which Villasante and others communicated their discoveries and how they structured their reports. Again, questions of empirical methods were crucial due to the lack of existing information on New World plants. However, Villasante chose to describe the plant he found as balsam because it was the name of an existing plant with known commercial value. In addition, he compared this plant to cinnamon and pepper, valuable spices that were sought after by the Spanish crown. The tests that Villasante performed demonstrated the viability of his discovery and his empirical data contributed to a growing catalog of knowledge sponsored by the Spanish crown. By standardizing a methodology to be followed by experimenters in the New World, the Casa de la Contratacion not only encouraged continued exploration, but began to assemble a base of knowledge against which future discoveries could be compared to determine not only their medicinal value, but their commercial value as well.

Launched on October 31, 2008, the station programs an eclectic format consisting of news, public affairs and adult album alternative (AAA) music programming during the day, along with indie and specialty music, talk, and cultural programming at night and on weekends. Unlike other non-commercial radio stations operating in the area, Radio Phoenix is unique because it includes volunteers as part of its staff, and provides area residents with public access airtime to produce local radio shows. The primary goal of the station is to serve as a vehicle for facilitating increased engagement of the community at large, with a special emphasis on engaging traditionally marginalized and underrepresented populations within metro Phoenix. Such groups include social and political progressives, persons of color, lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-questioning (LGBTQ) persons, organized labor, and immigrants. A secondary goal of the station is to expose listeners to viewpoints, cultures, and music not often available from commercial or existing public radio stations. A select amount of the station's programming can be heard Sunday mornings from 6am to 7am on KPNG 88.7FM as well as Sundays from 6am to 8am on KVIT 90.7FM through a program sharing relationship with the East Valley Institute of Technology (EVIT). Arizona Community Media Foundation (AzCMF), a 501(c)(3) public media organization and owner of Radio Phoenix, was the original owner of KPNG until selling the construction permit to EVIT. Likewise, the station's weekly relationship talk show The Venus Vault is simulcast on Sunday mornings from 11am to 12noon on KWSS FM 93.9. History In 2002, Phoenix-area attorney Victor Aronow and other residents of the city's east valley grew concerned about a noticeable decline in the coverage of local civic events, airplay of music by local artists, and an absence of diverse viewpoints on the local radio dial. After discovering the change was in part due to a 1996 federal law called the Telecommunications Act, Aronow and his group set out to develop a community oriented radio station that would have a focus on promoting local news, current affairs, and music programming for residents of Phoenix's growing east valley. A year later, in the fall of 2003, radio broadcaster Kaja Brown and indie music publicist Sheila Dean led an unofficial think tank made up of local small business owners, artists, musicians, and college students interested in discovering why Phoenix never got a full power, over the air, FM college music station. After spending a few months researching the topic via archived news articles as well as interviews with local media professors and public broadcasters, they discovered that Arizona State University attempted to obtain an FM license for such a station in the early 1980s, but their application was turned down due to a technical error. Since there were no other major universities in Phoenix at the time, and the community college district already operated the local NPR station, no other viable group existed in the area who could establish a college FM station. Some members of the think tank decided that the community should try creating its own indie music radio station, and in early 2004 formed the Arizona Community Media Foundation (aka AzCMF), as the vehicle for making this new station a reality. In late 2004, Aronow and his colleagues met Brown and the indie music radio group. They each decided that they were working towards a mutual goal of bringing community radio to the Phoenix area and decided to combine their efforts. Aronow's team became part of AzCMF and together they began building support for a community radio station in Phoenix. From 2005 to 2007, AzCMF's team educated themselves regarding the process of obtaining an FCC license and determined the most feasible path to launching a new station in the Phoenix area was to apply for a vacant FM frequency. Before they could do so, they had to find out if any FM frequencies were still available for use in Phoenix, and then, if so, had to wait for the FCC to accept new applications. In the meantime, the group decided to engage in a project to determine if there really was a need for a community radio station in the Phoenix area. For 10 weeks in the spring of 2007, AzCMF entered into a brokered time agreement with commercial radio station KAZG (1440 AM), which covered most of the Phoenix area. During those 10 weeks, the group aired the national news program Democracy Now! and supported the airtime by selling underwriting spots to local businesses and provided non-profits with public service announcements. The response to this test run was positive and the team at AzCMF realized that a need really did exist for a community radio station in Phoenix. During the fall of 2007, AzCMF confirmed that there were two vacant full power FM frequencies available for use in the Phoenix area - 88.7FM and 90.7FM. The group decided to apply for both FM frequencies. As time went on, the organization’s Board of Directors realized the FCC might take longer than expected to rule on the applications they filed and a long-term project was needed to keep the public and new volunteers engaged. In the spring of 2008, in an attempt to build upon the public interest in their proposed station and as a way to better engage existing volunteers, AzCMF launched a community podcasting project known as Radio Phoenix On Demand. As the project’s volunteer base grew, more and more participants desired to create long-form radio programs spotlighting and promoting copyrighted music, which due to federal law, would be very expensive to obtain podcast licenses for. After researching affordable licensing options that would legally allow volunteers to create programs featuring copyrighted music, the AzCMF Board of Directors decided to create a new online radio station called Radio Phoenix, that would serve as a training ground for developing volunteers and talent for the organization’s long-term goal – operation of an FCC licensed FM station. Radio Phoenix launched at 6pm on Friday, October 31, 2008 with the first program being Pacifica Radio’s Democracy Now!, followed by live, local talk and music shows hosted by volunteers. In late 2010, AzCMF discovered that it was not selected the finalist for use of the vacant 90.7 frequency, which was instead awarded to EVIT. Between October 2010 and October 2011, due to a loss of its original operating space, Radio Phoenix functioned as a virtual station. During this year, station volunteers met at coffee houses, libraries and other community spaces to develop radio programs, fundraisers, and complete related work. In October 2011, Radio Phoenix became a tenant of the Phoenix Center for the Arts, a community arts center in downtown Phoenix, where its studios are now located. On Sunday, September 4, 2011, Radio Phoenix began a program sharing relationship with EVIT's new station, KVIT, the new radio station at EVIT. Under the relationship, KVIT, which covers the southeast suburbs of metro Phoenix, airs a select amount of Radio Phoenix programming on weekends. In 2012, KVIT expanded its coverage to include central Phoenix and its western suburbs by adding the 92.7FM frequency via translator K224CJ. In 2013, AzCMF's application for 88.7 FM was approved by the FCC, but in 2015, AzCMF sold the construction permit to EVIT, which built the station as KPNG 88.7. Radio Phoenix programming is now heard Sunday mornings from 6am to 7am on KPNG 88.7FM and Sundays 6am to 8am on KVIT 90.7FM. Programming Radio Phoenix airs an eclectic mix of news, public affairs and adult album alternative (AAA) music programming on weekdays between 12mid and 7pm, along with indie and specialty music, talk, and cultural programming on weeknights between 7pm and 12mid and all day on weekends. Radio Phoenix is the Phoenix area's Pacifica Radio affiliate, and carries many of their national news and public affairs programming, including Democracy Now!, Economic Update, Sprouts, The David Pakman Show, and The Thom Hartmann Program. The station is the local Phoenix affiliate of Native Voice One (NV1), the Native American public radio network. NV1 programs carried by the station includes National Native News, Native America Calling, Earthsongs, Trahant Reports, Voices from the Circle, and UnderCurrents WEEKEND. Radio Phoenix also airs national programming from KCRW in Los Angeles (Left, Right & Center, The Business, and The Treatment), WFMT in Chicago (Fiesta!, Relevant Tones, and The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center) and a variety of independent programs such as 12th Street Jump (jazz), Concierto (Latin classical), and Street Soldiers (violence prevention talk). Radio Phoenix volunteers produce more than 100 hours per week of original programming spanning a variety of genres and topics - including arts and culture, Native American public affairs, jazz and blues, rockabilly, world, indie rock, and everything in between. Some of the station's signature local programs include Full Moon Hacksaw (jazz and blues), HipRawk Nation (alternative rock, electronic, hip-hop, soul), Mark My Words (sports talk show), My World of Music (singer-songwriters, reggae, world), Native Talk Arizona (Arizona's only urban Native American public affairs radio program), Rockabilly Worldwide Mash-Up (local and international rockabilly music), Rise (local Phoenix-area and Arizona based bands), Soul Deluxe (mix show spotlighting soul music), Soul Star Live (Phoenix's only African-American public affairs radio program), The Althea Long Show (jazz, blues, reggae, world), The budcoach Radio Show (Cannabis culture and business news), The Bungalow Show (arts and culture magazine), The Venus Vault (relationships, pop culture, and indie music talk show), The Yaggah Movement RadioCast (African and Caribbean cultural program), and The YabYum Hour (indie music and arts program). Radio Phoenix original programs aired through its KPNG and KVIT program sharing relationship include The Althea Long Show (Sun 6a-7a on KVIT), My World of Music (Sun 7a-8a on KVIT), and Full Moon Hacksaw (Sun 6a-7a on KPNG). Likewise, low power FM station KWSS simulcasts The Venus Vault on Sundays from 11a-12n. Three of the station's original programs - Full Moon Hacksaw, My World of Music, and Soul Deluxe, are syndicated nationally and collectively air on more than 60 over-the-air radio stations across the United States.

Its original run lasted from 1955 to 1960, and has been revived at its original location as of October 2019. History The club was opened in 1955 by Jimmy Garofolo. Garofolo had owned the room since 1949 and had operated it as a restaurant, bar, and stage at various times, each endeavour turning out unsuccessfully. In 1955, saxophonist Charlie Parker was living across the street from the club with poet Ted Joans. Parker offered to play the club for Garofolo in order to get his drinks for free, which unofficially began the room's short-lived life as a jazz club. Parker died prior to the beginning of his engagement at the Bohemia, but the hype generated around his name being promoted was enough to garner further support for the new club. Among the bands that played the club were the first Miles Davis Quintet, Art Blakey's original Jazz Messengers, and Kenny Dorham's Jazz Prophets. At one point Herbie Nichols was the intermission pianist. Miles Davis's Prestige recordings Workin', Relaxin, Steamin, and Cookin were meant to convey the spirit of the group's performances at the Bohemia. This is most evident on Workin where the band's set closer \\"The Theme\\" is played at the end of each side of the record, and one piano trio number, \\"Ahmad's Blues\\", is featured. Oscar Pettiford penned the song \\"Bohemia After Dark\\" in spirit of the club. The cover photograph of the Miles Davis record 'Round About Midnight was one of several taken by Marvin Koner during the quintet's stay at the club in 1956. The photograph retains the actual colouring but is cropped from the original. The red hue was due to a red fluorescent light above the bandstand. As of October 2019, Café Bohemia has been revived in its original location, in the basement of the Barrow Street Ale House (which was established in 1990). Cannonball Adderley's New York debut On 19 June 1955 Julian and Nat Adderley arrived in New York on a trip for the former to work on his Master's Degree at New York University. That first night in the city the brothers went to the Café Bohemia to hear the Oscar Pettiford band, which was the club's house band at the time. Jerome Richardson, who was the group's regular saxophonist was unavailable that evening due to a recording session. Pettiford asked Charlie Rouse - who was in the audience - if he would sit in, but Rouse did not have his saxophone with him. Pettiford then noticed another audience member, Adderley, who had a saxophone case with him and told Rouse to ask this unknown man if he could borrow his horn. Instead, Rouse asked Cannonball if he would like to sit in with the group. Reluctantly, the leader complied and allowed Adderley to play. Overnight Adderley rose to prominence on the New York jazz scene. On 21 June he officially played his first night at the Bohemia; on June 28, 1955 he recorded with Kenny Clarke's group; on 14 July he recorded his first album as a leader. By October 1957 he was a member of the Miles Davis Sextet.

The Shrine and Historic Site consists of four historic buildings on their original locations: the 1819 convent, 1821 church, 1840 rectory, and 1888 schoolhouse. The convent, church, and rectory may be visited for historic tours and religious pilgrimages. The schoolhouse may be used for public or private gatherings. Artifacts from virtually every era in Old St. Ferdinand's history are on display in the museum and throughout the buildings.  Significance  The site represents a physical link to American pioneer times, the North American Jesuit Missions to the Native Americans as well as the home of Catholic education in the Midwest. The 1819 convent is the site of the first Catholic school between the Mississippi River and Rocky Mountains. The 1821 Church is the oldest remaining church building built between the Mississippi River and Rockies Mountains. It was the home of the region's only canonized Catholic saint, Saint Rose Philippine Duchesne.  History  Around 1767, just a few years after Pierre Laclede and August Chouteau established the fur-trading village of St. Louis, French plantation owners settled in an area they called \\"Fleurissant.\\" In 1782, August Chouteau named François Dunegant the \\"Commandant of Fleurissant\\" and charged him with protecting the settlement from Indian attacks.Saint Ferdinand de Florissant, by Gilbert J. Garraghan S. J. 1923 The Louisiana Territory had been ceded to Spain in 1763 Dream by the River, Barnaby Faherty S. J., 1973 and a 1788 census identified the settlement as \\"St. Ferdinand\\" with a population of 40 with seven plantations. At that time, Dunegant issued a land grant to establish a church and priest's residence. Local carpenter, Hyacenthe Deshetres oversaw the construction of the church. In 1789, Father Bernard de Limpach, a Capuchin friar, began serving as the first pastor. The church was built on the current site of Spanish Land Grant Park, on the southeast corner of the block bounded by rue St. Charles, rue St Ferdinand, rue St. Louis, and rue St. Denis. A parish cemetery was located next to the log church. The church was the center of ecclesiastical and civic life in St. Ferdinand de Fleurissant. While the church was used for sacramental and devotional purposes, the area outside its doors was used for proclamations, business and real-estate transactions, and meetings of a public nature. The old log church from the 1780s succumbed to a fire in 1836.Archives of Old St. Ferdinand Shrine In 1818, Bishop Louis Dubourg arrived in St. Louis to establish his residence and Episcopal see.The History of the Archdiocese of St. Louis, by Rev. John Rothenstiener He went a long way to attract Catholic missionaries and educators to settlements throughout the territory, serving both pioneers from Europe and Native Americans. St. Ferdinand would be directly affected by DuBourg's evangelization program in the Upper Louisiana Purchase Territory. Among the religious DuBourg recruited following his ordination as bishop in 1815 was a member of the recently formed Religious of the Sacred Heart, Mother Rose Philippine Duchesne. Duchesne established the first Catholic school for girls west of the Mississippi in St. Charles, Missouri, in 1818, then in 1819 relocated to Florissant. Later, she founded nine schools in the Louisiana Territory and received the vows of the first American women to enter religious life in the Midwest.Philippine Duchesne, Frontier Missionary of the Sacred Heart, by Louis Callan R.S.C.J. She succeeded in getting Jesuits to settle in Florissant, and in 1840 to build a large, enduring rock building from limestone with walnut beams, the centerpiece of their St. Stanislaus Seminary until they moved away in 1971. In her last years she would be called \\"Quah- kah-ka-num-ad\\" or \\"Woman-who-prays-always\\" by members of the Patowamie tribe. Pope John Paul II canonized St. Rose Philippine Duchesne in 1988.  The 1819 convent The convent was built in the Federal Style under the supervision of Father Duran, a Trappist monk who was serving as pastor. The sisters arrived in time for Christmas 1819, where Father de la Croix offered the first Mass in the chapel at midnight on December 24. The convent was the home to the Religious of the Sacred Heart and to boarding students (girls) and served as a school for both French-speaking, English-speaking, and Native American students. Many extant personal letters from Philippine Duchesne and the students provide a glimpse into the daily hardships, Catholic devotions, and personal interactions of residents of the convent. It would be the saint's home from 1819-1827 and from 1834-1840. The first floor of the convent includes a chapel, two parlors, and a refectory (dining room). Beneath the staircase to the second floor is a small closet in which Mother Duchesne slept so she could be close to the chapel. The second floor and attic space was used as a convent community room, dormitories, a novitiate, and infirmary. The Religious of the Sacred Heart left St. Ferdinand in 1846 and were replaced in 1847 by the Sisters of Loretto. The Sisters of Loretto convent was enlarged but the addition was removed, preserving only the original part known by St. Philippine Duchesne.  The 1821 church The current church replaced the old log church in 1821. The current church is the oldest west of the Mississippi and east of the Rocky Mountains. Mother Duchesne paid for the cornerstone of the church. Out of deference to her principal personal devotions to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and St. Francis Regis, the church was dedicated to the Sacred Heart under the invocation of St. Ferdinand III and St. Francis Regis. For the education of boys and missionary work among the indigenous people Bishop DuBourg invited the Jesuits. Charles Van Quickenborne arrived in Florissant with a large group of Belgian novices in 1823. He was promptly put in charge of the parish. The Jesuits served there for the entire duration of the parish. Famous missionary to the Native Americans Pierre-Jean DeSmet, S.J., was ordained a priest in St. Ferdinand church in 1827. Fr. DeSmet traveled 180,000 miles visiting almost every Native American tribe the West and crossing the Atlantic a total of nineteen times to solicit financial support from nearly every European nation.Catholic Encyclopedia He established Catholic missions at the request of tribal chiefs and bishops. DeSmet arranged peace between warring tribes, calmed uprisings and negotiated a treaty for the U.S. government eventually befriending the famous chief, Sitting Bull. Even Protestant writers remarked that he was the sincerest friend to the Native Americans. Fr. DeSmet returned to St. Ferdinand regularly to minister to the parishioners, seek Mother Duchesne's help, and consult fellow Jesuits. Bishop Joseph Rosati, the first bishop of St. Louis, consecrated the church in 1832. The church was lengthened in 1880.  The 1840 rectory The rectory was home to the Jesuit priests that served St. Ferdinand. The first floor consisted of rooms for parish meetings and the second floor was the residential space for the priests.  The 1888 schoolhouse A parish school was constructed in 1888 and a second floor was added in 1889.  Historic recognition and designation as a shrine  In 1955 Old St. Ferdinand ceased to be a parish and the boundaries were redrawn. The Friends of Old St. Ferdinand, Inc. was established in 1958 to maintain and preserve the historic structures. Fire damaged the Church and rectory in 1966 but they were completely repaired and restored. Cardinal John Carberry, Archbishop of St. Louis, transferred all buildings and property to the Friends of Old St. Ferdinand in 1978. All four buildings were included on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as the St. Ferdinand's Shrine Historic District. With the canonization of Mother Duchesne in 1988 the Archdiocese of St. Louis designated the historic complex as a shrine to St. Rose Philippine Duchesne.

A Caltrans inspection station for trucks is stationed at the upper terminus of the grade. Conejo Grade functions as a barrier which separates Ventura County into East County and West County. Historically, the mountain was known for its many jackrabbits and prickly pear cacti. The surrounding area was formed by volcanic eruptions millions of years ago, a rare geological formation in Southern California. The native Chumash people had a trading trail through the pass, and it later served as a trading route for farmers and their wagons down the Conejo Grade to the wharf in Port Hueneme. The grade experienced improvements by the newly established State Highway Department in 1912, when the road measured long and had 49 curves. Traffic kept increasing and the road was straightened and relocated in 1935. The new road was a mile shorter and only had twelve curves.Brant, Cherie (2006).

Ten years later the First Baptist Church housed the collection in their new building. The Waverly Public Free Library was created in 1868, following a lecture series which raised more than $300. This lecture series included programs featuring Clara Barton, Frederick Douglass, John Heyl Vincent, and Paul Du Chaillu. The money raised was placed in a fund for developing an actual library building. The books were next stored in the Waverly Opera House, and then moved to rooms over Broadie's Drug Store in 1901.Drolet, Anne, ed.

On February 20, 1903, Andrew Carnegie, a wealthy New York philanthropist, awarded Waverly a $10,000 grant to construct a new library building. The new library was dedicated on January 1, 1905, and opened to the public for their use. At that time, the population of Waverly was 2,916 and the library owned less than 2,000 books.Andrew Carnegie, New York philanthropist, awarded the city of Waverly a $10,000 grant to construct a free public library in 1903. By 1965, the library had 7,872 registered borrowers, and the collection totaled over 30,000 books. A \\"wrap-around\\" structure was built in 1968 to accommodate the increase in patrons and materials.Locke, Ray, ed. (1996). \\"Waverly - Rich in Iowa Heritage\\", Heritage House Publishing, Marceline, MO. In 1992, the city of Waverly ordered that a study be done to consider the library's future options. It was decided that a new library building would be constructed at a different location, and so in 1998 the present building was completed.

The series was begun in 2000 and contains eight works, the most famous of which is probably the Concerto for Cello and Orchestra. Some of the concerti in the volumes were written before the commencement of the project and were categorized into the series. Volumes There are four volumes of the Project: * The Concerto Project Vol. I, containing the Cello Concerto and the Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra. * The Concerto Project Vol. II, containing the Piano Concerto No. 2: After Lewis and Clark, and the Concerto for Harpsichord and Orchestra. * The Concerto Project Vol. III, containing the Concerto Grosso and the Concerto for Saxophone Quartet and Orchestra. * The Concerto Project Vol. IV, containing the Double Concerto for Violin, Cello and Orchestra and the Tirol Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (also known simply as Piano Concerto No. 1). These concerti were all produced by Orange Mountain Music. Background =Commission= Philip Glass wrote all of the concerti on commission from various ensembles or people; the Concerto Fantasy, for example, was requested by Jonathan Haas, a respected timpanist. Glass stated in 2000: \\"Jonathan Haas approached me almost ten years ago with an invitation to write a Timpani Concerto for him. It seemed we were in agreement to begin our project when a series of operas and symphonic commissions led to a series of postponements. Now, years later, the work is finally completed, a three movement concerto with cadenza. It has also grown into a \\"double\\" concerto requiring two timpanists playing a total of nine timpani between them.\\"www.philipglass.com, vol. i. Similarly, the Cello Concerto was commissioned by friends of Glass, William and Rebecca Kreuger, for the fiftieth birthday of renowned cellist Julian Lloyd Webber, who later premiered the piece in Beijing.philipglass.com, cello concerto =Composition and influence= Some of the concerti were written about the same time as Glass' later symphonies, and distinct similarities can be heard, especially in the Toltec Symphony. Along with Glass' recent symphonic work, the pieces mark a certain progression of Glass' musical approach; audibly, it can be seen that the composer has undergone major changes since his earlier, pro-minimalist period. Although Glass' music can still, in some sense, be categorized as \\"minimalist,\\" the composer appears to have more classical tendencies, and has himself described his music as \\"classicist.\\" These concerti are therefore a high-point of Glass' classical direction: they demonstrate a distinct combination of Postmodernist methods and older, more conventional repertoire (incidentally, Glass' favorite composer is Schubert, whose Classical-Romantic bridging can be heard as a considerable influence on the contemporary composer's stylistic moves). Also discernible is a slight influence from the post-Mahlerian revolutionaries, mostly that of Stravinsky—on whom Glass has written extensively—in that the tempi are occasionally irregular: an uncommon choice for Glass, who usually stays strict to rhythmic pulse. This stray from uncompromising adherence to Glass' branch of minimalism can possibly be interpreted as an indication of a new level of musical progression, as well a statement supporting the continuation of an ongoing musical evolution. The concerti are considered hallmarks of twenty-first century classical composition, and have been performed many times. For more information about the selected works, visit the Philip Glass page.

The film is both Heidecker and Wareheim's feature directorial debuts. The film stars Heidecker and Wareheim with a supporting cast which includes Zach Galifianakis, Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, Ray Wise, Twink Caplan, Robert Loggia, and Will Forte. After wasting their billion-dollar film budget on a short film, Heidecker and Wareheim try to pay back the money by re-opening an abandoned shopping mall. The film was released in theaters on March 2, 2012, and was released to iTunes and on-demand January 27, 2013. Plot Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim are two filmmakers who are given a record-setting $1 billion budget to make a movie. The funds are provided by Tommy Schlaaang and the Schlaaang Corporation. The two waste all of their money on the making of Bonjour, Diamond Jim, a three-minute film (based on a poem by \\"personal shopper and spiritual guru\\" Jim Joe Kelly (Zach Galifianakis), whom they paid $500,000 a week), plus expensive makeovers, 10-course lunches, real diamonds for Diamond Jim's suit, and a Johnny Depp impersonator. Because of this, the two leave Los Angeles in fear that they will go to prison or be hunted down by the Schlaaang Corp. After seeing an advertisement for it in a nightclub bathroom, Tim and Eric decide to renovate the S'Wallow Valley Mall run by Damien Weebs (Will Ferrell), in the hopes that they will make back their billion-dollar debt. While trying to refurbish the mall, they must deal with vagrants such as a man-child named Taquito (John C. Reilly), bizarre stores (such as Reggie's Used Toilet Paper Discount Warehouse), and a man-eating wolf that stalks the food court. During their time at the S'Wallow Valley Mall, Tim and Eric also face many challenges, such as an angry shop owner named Allen Bishopman (Will Forte) who \\"doesn't want anything to change\\", and the fact that Eric is in love with Katie (Twink Caplan), a woman who works at the mall (whom Eric also compulsively masturbates to.) Because of this, Tim poisons Eric and ends up making love to Katie, whilst Eric goes to the Shrim Alternative Healing Center, run by Dr. Doone Struts (Ray Wise) to seek \\"spiritual healing\\", only to be placed in a bathtub which gets filled with diarrhea by Struts' sons as part of the \\"spiritual healing\\". After the event, Eric finds Tim sleeping with Katie and subsequently fights Tim. After the fight, Eric apologizes to Tim for starting the fight and understands why Tim made love to Katie. They are eventually discovered by the Schlaaang Corporation because of Allen. After a dramatic shootout in front of the mall, in which most of the main characters are killed, Tim and Eric manage to kill the members of the Schlaaang Corporation, and are sentenced to death for murder. However, it is revealed that the preceding events are actually a film the two were showing to Steven Spielberg, who pronounces it the greatest movie ever made. Tim and Eric then celebrate with their Awesome Show co-stars.

The idea for a dying shopping center came from Monroeville Mall (of Dawn of the Dead fame) and Hunt Valley Mall in Baltimore. Like the fictional mall, Hunt Valley was in fact redeveloped from top to bottom except the interior walkways have been converted to open-air and was successful upon its \\"grand reopening\\". The same went for Desert Fashion Plaza which was in the process of being de-malled and re-imagined as a new \\"Main Street\\" at the time filming began, lending authenticity to the movie setting. Before the movie's release Tim and Eric started the Billion Dollar Pledge asking fans and celebrities to support them by signing a document stating they would not illegally download the film, and also not to see its box office competition The Lorax. Stars who took part in the pledge ranged from comedians and actors Ben Stiller, Mark Proksch, Bob Odenkirk, Seth Green, Peter Serafinowicz, Todd Barry, Rashida Jones and others, to musicians Weird Al Yankovic, Maynard James Keenan, Josh Groban, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and Maroon 5.https://www.facebook.com/zittwins Release The film premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival in January 2012. In an interview, the duo deadpanned that the film was spliced together with out-takes from the DVD release of Rango. =Box office= Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie opened to 24 theaters on March 2, 2012 and grossed $87,475 in its opening weekend, ranking at #42. It would go on for another 7 weeks before closing to only $201,436 in the domestic box office. =Critical reception= Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie has received mixed to negative reviews from critics on its original release. The film ranking website Rotten Tomatoes rated the film \\"rotten\\", with 36% of the 74 critics sampled giving the film positive reviews, with an average score of 4.26/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Tim & Eric's Billion Dollar Movie is on a gleeful quest to repulse audiences, but sometimes less is more with this sketchy duo.\\" Variety gave the film a negative review, feeling that Tim and Eric \\"torture their purposefully inept, shortform sketch work into feature length...to diminishing returns\\" and that \\"fans of their Cartoon Network series or those simply familiar with the pair via YouTube will likely find the extended version of their pathos-and-pain- driven comedy hard to digest.\\" The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, stating \\"Auds attuned to Tim & Eric's weird wavelength will find plenty of guffaws in the first half, but a plot this thin can't sustain comedy based on discomfort.\\" The A.V. Club gave the film a B+ rating, opining that the film \\"feels genuinely dangerous and transgressive: it makes a virtue of going way too far because other comedies don't go far enough.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film 1/2 star out of 4 and said it was so bad, it wouldn't even qualify for a review in a book consisting solely of reviews of terrible movies (along the lines of his \\"Your Movie Sucks\\" editions).

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on October 2, 2011. The episode mainly centers around the Griffin family, who are riding out an oncoming hurricane. In their attempt to pass the time, they participate in numerous activities and games. After being condemned by her family for the last time, Meg, fed up of being bullied over the years, finally snaps and confronts them of all the abusiveness they've done, eventually causing the entire family to turn their own rage on each other. Meanwhile, Brian secretly consumes magic mushrooms which causes him to have hallucinations. \\"Seahorse Seashell Party\\" is the second part of the Night of the Hurricane block with The Cleveland Show and American Dad!. The episode was first announced by Seth MacFarlane at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. It was written by Wellesley Wild and directed by Brian Iles. Originally scheduled to air on May 1, 2011 as the sixteenth episode of the ninth season of Family Guy, the episode was postponed due to the 2011 Super Outbreak subsequently coinciding with the timing of the scheduled episodes. Reception of \\"Seahorse Seashell Party\\" by television critics has been negative, with its humor and main plot being the most criticized. An estimated 6.91 million viewers tuned into the episode upon its initial airing, while also garnering a 3.5/8 rating in the 18–49 demographic according to the Nielsen ratings. The episode featured guest performances by Ioan Gruffudd, Dee Bradley Baker, Debra Wilson, Kat Purgal, and Colin Ford along with several other recurring guest voice actors for the series. Plot As a hurricane approaches Quahog, Rhode Island, the Griffin family prepares for its arrival. In his own attempt to pass the time, Brian decides to use magic mushrooms, to the curiosity of Stewie. As the mushrooms start to take effect on Brian, he begins having hallucinations and eventually cuts his own left ear off. Stewie tries to help Brian by staying by his side and taking care of him, but Brian continues to perceive himself in a bizarre world where he is continually attacked by various monsters resembling the Griffins and Quagmire. Brian eventually snaps out of the hallucination after Stewie helps him downstairs to drink some water. The rest of the family attempts to pass the time by playing charades and various other games. They are unable to keep themselves entertained and take their frustrations out on Meg as usual, evidenced by the family playing \\"finger bang\\" and insult her into doing it on her own, Peter humming to a song from Indiana Jones and snapping at Meg for accidentally distracting him. Having had enough of all the abuse over the years, Meg finally turns against them. She starts with Chris by calling him a bastard for his bullying treatment of her and how he never takes her side against their parents. When Lois tries to tell her that she's taking her problems out on everyone else, she brings up her delinquent past and tells her that she is \\"the furthest thing from\\" the perfect mother. Meg also informs Lois that when she turns 18, she is considering never seeing her again. Tearfully, Lois profusely apologizes to Meg. Finally, Meg confronts Peter who, unable to comprehend her insults, thinks that his daughter's argument is amusing, even when she points out his destructive tendencies and that he'd go to prison if anyone saw his treatment of her. It eventually dawns on Peter that he is being insulted when Meg calls him a \\"waste of a man.\\" Shocked, he demands Lois to make Meg stop, but she refuses on the grounds he didn't stand up for her. Within moments, the whole family turn their own abusive criticisms on each other, which ends with a saddened Peter running away to his room in tears, leaving Meg and Brian alone to discuss the situation. Despite Brian complimenting her for standing up for herself, Meg concludes that her family cannot survive without a \\"lightning rod\\" to absorb its dysfunction, and that her enduring her family's antagonism helps keep them together. She then decides to apologize and forgive her family for what just happened and replies that she was taking her own problems out on everyone else, restoring their egos, personalities and original opinions. Stewie then breaks the fourth wall by telling the audience about the dangers of drugs: \\"Tonight's Family Guy was a very special episode about drug use, but the simple fact is, it's no laughing matter. To learn more about drugs, visit your local library. There's probably a guy behind there who sells drugs.\\" Production and development Ioan Gruffudd made a guest appearance as the narrator in the episode. The episode was first announced in July 2010 by series creator Seth MacFarlane at the Comic-Con International in San Diego, California. Kevin Reilly, the entertainment president of the Fox Broadcasting Company, originally pitched the idea for the crossover, which was inspired by theme nights of comedy shows from the 1980s. MacFarlane described the crossover event to be an \\"enormous challenge\\" and a \\"substantial undertaking\\"; he chose to do one central story line so that each writing staff would not have to write stories for unfamiliar characters. MacFarlane was also willing to do another crossover event if this one receives successful ratings. In April 2011, executives of the Fox Broadcasting Company officially announced that \\"Seahorse Seashell Party\\" would air on May 1. However, on April 29, it was announced that the crossover event would be removed from the schedule, in response to a series of tornadoes that killed nearly 300 people in the Southern United States. The episodes were subsequently replaced by repeats of \\"I Am the Walrus\\" from American Dad!, \\"Brian Writes a Bestseller\\" from Family Guy, and \\"Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'\\" from The Cleveland Show. MacFarlane agreed with the decisions after consulting with the executives of Fox, and a spokeswoman for the company later announced that the episodes would air the following season. \\"Seahorse Seashell Party\\" was written by Wellesley Wild and directed by Brian Iles. It features guest appearances from Ioan Gruffudd, Dee Bradley Baker, Colin Ford, and Debra Wilson. This episode marked Gruffudd's first guest appearance since the season eight episode \\"The Splendid Source\\" and Wilson's first guest appearance since the season three episode \\"And the Wiener Is...\\". Cultural references \\"Seahorse Seashell Party\\" features several references to media, music, film, and other pop culture phenomena. The episode's title references dialogue from the viral video \\"Drinking out of Cups\\" by electronic musician and composer Dan Deacon. Peter mentions wanting to watch \\"G.I. José,\\" which leads to a cutaway parodying the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero public service announcements with a Mexican version of the title character. Peter mentions the film Fletch while playing charades. One of the many passing-time gags involves Peter performing a sing-a-long to the opening chase music from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. As Brian's hallucinations begin to worsen, Stewie attempts to calm him, reminding him that seeing Lady Gaga nude was a worst-case scenario. Towards the end of the episode, a cutaway gag involving a confrontation between an African American woman and an Italian American man parodies the National Geographic's documentaries. A reference to the social networking site Twitter was also made by Stewie. Reception \\"Seahorse Seashell Party\\" first aired in the United States on October 2, 2011 as part of the animation television night on Fox. It was preceded by episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show, while being followed by an episode of American Dad!. It was viewed by 6.91 million viewers upon its initial airing, despite simultaneously airing with Desperate Housewives on ABC, The Amazing Race on CBS, and a game between the Baltimore Ravens and the New York Jets on NBC. Total viewership for the episode was the highest out of its respective line-up. \\"Seahorse Seashell Party\\" garnered a 3.5/8 rating in the 18–49 demographic, according to the Nielsen ratings, also becoming the highest rating of the animation television night on Fox. Total viewership and ratings were significantly down from the previous episode, \\"Lottery Fever\\", which was watched by 7.69 million viewers and garnered a 4.1/9 rating in the 18–49 demographic. The main plot of \\"Seahorse Seashell Party\\" was panned by critics (particularly the ending). Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote of the episode, \\"This far into the show’s run, shifting to a much more dramatic bottle episode and reaching for emotional payoffs felt far too little too late.\\" He resumed: \\"Nobody cares about any member of the Griffin family the way we care about every last Simpson. I feel bad about Meg becoming the scapegoat. Not because she’s a good character, but because instead of tweaking and working to make her appreciated or comically valuable, Family Guy spent years going down the path of least resistance and simply joined the fan chorus of hatred. One episode of pointed, forced justification for that shift doesn’t change a thing.\\" McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of D+. Similarly, Terron Moore of Ology felt that much of the episode was wasted. In his review, Moore stated that \\"Seahorse Seashell Party\\" was \\"an episode that spends a lot of time addressing something that didn’t need to be addressed.\\" He gave the episode a 4.5 out of ten points. TV Fanatic Kate Moon was less negative of the episode, stating that even though Meg confronting her family in regards to her treatment was long overdue, she concluded that it felt contrived and uninteresting. Critics were polarized with the episode subplot. While McFarland expressed enjoyment of some of the animation of the episode, he asserted that it \\"fell flat\\". Moon exclaimed that the subplot would have been more interesting had Stewie ingested the mushrooms alongside Brian. The episode debuted in the United Kingdom on May 20, 2012, and achieved 1.6 million viewers.

The rivers Paminiyar, Koraiyar, Kilaithankiyar, Marakkakoraiyar and other tributaries of the river Cauvery flow through Muthupet and adjacent villages. At the tail end, they form a lagoon before meeting the sea. The northern and western borders of the lagoon are occupied by muddy silt ground which is devoid of mangroves. The mangroves beyond Muthupet lagoon are discontinuously found along the shore and extended up to Point Calimere. Muthupet mangrove forest was under the control of Chatram Department from 1853 to 1912 (Chengappa, 1918). The Government of the Presidency of Madras Gazette (1937) shows, from 1923 to 1936, half of the revenue obtained from selling mangrove products was paid to the revenue department and the remaining half was spent to maintain the \\"Chatrams\\" (Charity homes). The Government declared the Muthupet mangrove forest as revenue forest in February 1937 and accordingly the mangrove forest was handed over to the forest department of the Madras Presidency. The forest is maintained by the Tamil Nadu Forest Department. The entire mangrove forest is divided into Palanjur reserve forest, Thamarankottai reserve forest, Maravakkadu reserve forest, Vadakadu reserve forest, Thuraikadu reserve forest and Muthupet reserve forest. left The word 'lagoon' refers to the shallow salt or brackish water body that lies close to the sea. Muthupet reserve forest covers the lagoon, river creeks and the mudflats. Muthupet (mullipallam) Lagoon is a spectacular natural creation, which is 8 km from nearby Muthupet town and can be reachable only by boat. The lagoon is shallow with the average of 1m depth. The bottom of the lagoon is formed of silt clay substratum. The tidal fluctuations can be observed well with the exposure of oyster beds and roots during low tide. The tidal fluctuations are playing a major role in dispersing the mangrove seeds. Dense mangroves mostly cover the lagoon shore. The islets are found on western side which are submerged during high tide. The salinity is the major environmental factor, controlling zonation of Muthupet mangrove forest. Avicennia marina is the conqueror of the forest which is found as a single dominant species. Southern side (mud flat) separates the lagoon from adjacent sea that also leaves a permanent mouth of lagoon with seasonally opened shallow waterways. The width of mudflat is increased from lagoon mouth to the eastern direction. The mudflat looks like a desert in summer, but the presence of dead gastropods under the surface soil layer and the erosion of soil at the centre of mudflat reveal the submergence of mudflat during flood. There is a difference between the lagoon shore and seashore of the same mudflat, in the aspect of distance of mangroves from fluctuating water level. right The mangroves have grown close to water level in lagoon side but not in seashore. The reason may be the difference in the nature of fine clayey silt deposition that carried by the rivers. The salt marshes are found as under herb as well as lining the inner side of the forest. In the degraded central part of the mudflat, the soft fine silt is found only around the salt marshes. But, the remaining barren ground is hard (clay) which may due to the erosion of surface silt by wind or floodwater. Thousands of partially decomposed rooted trunks that found on the southeastern side of Muthupet lagoon are indicating the past, indiscriminate exploitation. left (100–150 m in width and 5–6 km in length). The density of mangroves in eastern side of Muthupet lagoon is comparatively lower than other areas. Tamil Nadu forest department has excavated several canals across the mudflat. Each main canal which enhances the water movement between sea and lagoon, has several sub canals on either side with a substantial number of mangrove seedlings.

It was painted in the spring of 1912, at the height of the development of analytic Cubism. Bottle, Glass, Fork is one of the best representations of the point in Picasso's career when his Cubist painting reached almost full abstraction. The analytic phase of Cubism was an original art movement developed by Picasso and his contemporary Georges Braque (1882–1963) and lasted from 1908-1912. Like Bottle, Glass, Fork, the paintings of this movement are characterized by little use of color, and a complex, elegant composition of small, fragmented, tightly interwoven planes within an all-over composition of broader planes. While the figures in Bottle, Glass, Fork can be difficult to discern, the objects do emerge after careful study of the painting. The painting is displayed in the Cleveland Museum of Art. The painting Bottle, Glass, Fork was painted with oils on canvas, in monochromatic shades of brown, grey, black, and white. The painting itself takes an oval shape, although it is now placed in a rectangular frame that measures 93 cm tall and 76 cm wide (37 inches tall and 30 inches wide). Bottle, Glass, Fork can be seen in the Cleveland Museum of Art in Cleveland, Ohio, with other notable paintings by Picasso, including Woman in a Cape (1901), La Vie (1903), and Harlequin with Violin (1918). Picasso's purpose in painting Bottle, Glass, Fork was to examine a still-life of everyday objects in terms of flat planes, thoroughly redefining their structural and spatial relationships. Picasso avoided the use of strong color in this analytical painting, instead relying on the contrasts of tonal shading in brown, gray, black and white to create forms and strengthen spatial interaction. There is no clear perspective in the painting, although a shallow sense of space can be discerned through the overlapping shapes and forms, which creates a step-by- step movement back into the picture plane. The viewer's eye is guided around the painting and into the center by the presence of curving black lines that mimic the oval shape of the canvas, although the composition remains chiefly architectural. Bottle, Glass, Fork presents a highly ordered structure that is meant to represent a still-life of objects arranged on a café table, although the forms are initially difficult to distinguish. Interpretation The title of the painting, Bottle, Glass, Fork, is the first indication that Picasso is portraying a still-life, perhaps set on a table at one of the cafés in Paris that Picasso and his contemporaries frequented. The bottle is the largest whole plane on the canvas, placed in the upper-left quadrant of the oval. Its cylindrical shape is indicated by the highlights and shading, making the bottle appear rounded in comparison with the other planes. The glass is harder to place, as there are several half-circle shapes that look as though they could represent goblets. However, an oval atop a shaded triangle, which sits next to another shaded triangle, which are both presented above a cylindrical glass stem, form a collection of shapes that are reminiscent of a martini glass in front of and to the left of the large bottle. The fork can be placed in the lower-right quadrant because of the short, curved black lines highlighted against a white parallelogram, indicating the prongs of the fork. Once the prongs are found, the viewer can make out the brown handle slightly below the prongs and separated from them by a small triangle. With the title objects placed within the painting, other objects also begin to emerge from the geometric contours. At the very bottom and center of the painting there is a shape that resembles a key, perhaps to Picasso's art studio. The two small, swirling shapes diagonally to the right of the key might represent croissants to go along with the drinks in the bottle. Above the swirls there is a somewhat naturalistic depiction of a knife receding into space, indicating to the viewer that these objects actually do sit on a table that is both receding back and tilting up towards the surface of the painting. Other significant compositional elements within Bottle, Glass, Fork have nothing to do with the title of the work, but are found in the letters that Picasso included, half- hidden behind the overlapping shapes. The most obvious are the bold, black letters, EAN above ARIS on a white background, which recalls a poster or a folded newspaper. “ARIS” most likely indicates the word “PARIS,” but the EAN could indicate multiple meanings. It could be the word OCEAN, which would correspond with the nautical theme of the dockside café scenes in some of Picasso's previous still life paintings. Because of Picasso's tendency to reveal his radical political tendencies even in his most apolitical still lifes, it has been speculated that EAN forms part of the title of an anarchist Parisian newspaper, L'Intransigeant, or The Intransigent. The other set of letters is found on the upper left of the canvas and read “e 20.” These letters look as if they have been stenciled onto a streaky brown background resembling wood, indicating that they may be a part of a wooden sign. It is most likely that the letters refer to “Café 20,” a popular meeting place for artists in fin de siècle Paris. This gives the viewer a final placement for the still-life, letting us know that we are seeing an everyday table setting in a liberal café that Picasso, his patrons, and their contemporaries frequented, where they could drink and exchange ideas about politics as they read the anarchist newspaper, art, literature, and their rapidly changing culture. Background and development =Paul Cézanne= Picasso and Braque's main source of inspiration when developing Cubism came from the still-life paintings of the Impressionist artist Paul Cézanne (1839–1906). Unlike many of his contemporary Impressionist painters, Cézanne was not concerned with capturing the ephemeral effects of light reflected off of the surfaces found in nature. Rather, he focused on creating an image of his “sensation” of the world, which he perceived as filled with solid, enduring forms. Cézanne integrated these forms into the space he creating within his paintings while still respecting the flatness of the painted canvas; an example is his still life Basket of Apples (1895). His blocky brushstrokes lay parallel to the picture plane, creating a tension between flatness and spatial relationships that is found in Glass, Bottle, Fork. Cézanne also relied on the use of multiple perspectives in one painting to capture a sensation within an image, a principle that would become central to Picasso's cubism. =Gustave Courbet= A less obvious, but still significant, influence on analytical Cubism is the leader of the 19th-century Realist movement, Gustave Courbet (1819–1877). Courbet painted figural compositions, landscapes, and still lifes. He gained notoriety for commenting on social issues in his works and painting subject matter that was considered to be too vulgar to be painted, like the life of the peasants, the working conditions of the poor, and prostitution. Although their work seems drastically different at first glance, Courbet's influence on Cubism can be found in Picasso's underlying goals. Just as Courbet attempted to present a realistic vision of his world, in Bottle, Glass, Fork Picasso attempts to create an accurate representation of the table in the café. Picasso's method of realism is not an accurate optical imitation of the natural world, but a more inclusive type of realism. He included many perspectives of an object and relied on the associations made in the mind of the viewer because of their own sensory experiences with the objects. An example of this is The Stone Breakers (1850). Painting as language Picasso's works are often analyzed in terms of their relation to language. When attempting to make sense of Picasso's most sophisticated analytical Cubist paintings, many art historians approach the paintings as a branch of the hermetic language that art historian Natasha Staller described in her article, “Babel: Hermetic Languages, Universal Languages, and Anti-Languages in Fin de Siècle Parisian Culture.” Hermetic languages are like codes and actually conceal a meaning that can only be deciphered by those privileged enough to have the key to breaking the code. Picasso seems to be actively employing this concept in Bottle, Glass, Fork. Although Picasso is dealing with very concrete subject matter, he has rejected the literal meaning of objects, instead preferring to create art that was “intentionally cryptic and obscure” and required that one be privy to the intellectual code of Cubist aesthetics and to understand the details of the alternative society of artists and intellectuals in which Picasso lived and worked. Impact on future art The influence of analytical Cubist work like Bottle, Glass, Fork on future artist movements was enormous. Picasso and Braque created a highly original method of relating objects to each other within space, developing a technique of painting that created a whole sensory experience rather than just a visual experience. Their ideas and structure have influenced later movements like Orphism, Futurism, Expressionism, Dadaism, Purism, Synchromism, and every genre of later abstract art.

Some of these locations are mandated by law for nuclear power plants and other nuclear facilities. Some of them serve as part of a national monitoring network for use in a nuclear emergency. Others are independent monitoring stations maintained by individuals. Interest in the levels of radiation all over the nation increased dramatically during the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. At that time, a number of people began streaming from monitoring stations, and some international organizations conducted special monitoring operations to assess the state of radiation levels near the power plant and throughout Japan. Monitoring at Nuclear Power Plants Regulations per the Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission prescribe some standards that a monitoring system at a power producing nuclear plant must adhere to. For the purposes of regulation, monitoring systems are divided into two categories. *Category 1: Design of the monitoring system has to fit S-class seismic criteria and have diversity and independence in the channels that constitute the system. *Category 2: These detectors are connected to the plant emergency power system. Additionally, a condition for both categories is that it have the ability to monitor continuously and record its results.Nuclear Safety Commission.

During normal operation, plants have to monitor gas and liquid radioactive effluent releases.

It has been called a \\"computer-based decision support system\\" by researchers, and its function is for real-time dose assessment in radiological emergencies. In 1993 it had been developed for domestic local range accidents and was in the process to scale up to a national scale emergency response program linked to local governments. A worldwide version (WSPEEDI) was under development. Use in Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster The government recommendation that people voluntarily evacuate from places in the 20–30 km range from the Fukushima Daiichi plant came after the Nuclear Safety Commission watchdog released forecasts based on SPEEDI measurements. It was found that radiation levels differed significantly based on geography and wind direction, and it was suggested that because of this, the way evacuation areas were being designated should be changed and become more detailed. The Yomiuri Shinbun calculated radiation doses based on data from the Fukushima prefectural government and found they corresponded with the forecasts. SPEEDI figured in controversy surrounding the Japanese government's use of the data and its failure to use it in planning evacuation routes. Data on the dispersal of radioactive materials were provided to the U.S. forces by the Japanese Ministry for Science a few days after March 11; however, the data was not shared with the Japanese public until March 23. According to Watanabe's testimony before the Diet, the US military was given access to the data \\"to seek support from them\\" on how to deal with the nuclear disaster. Although SPEEDI's effectiveness was limited by not knowing the amounts released in the disaster, and thus was considered \\"unreliable\\", it was still able to forecast dispersal routes and could have been used to help local governments designate more appropriate evacuation routes.The Japan Times (17 January 2012) U.S. forces given SPEEDI data early =Ishikawa Lab, Hino, Tokyo= Following the Fukushima disaster, a lab in Hino Tokyo received major attention after a researcher streamed readings from a Geiger counter on his website. =Pachube= The Pachube (pronounced Patch bay) site allows users to stream various sensor data to the web in real time and was put to use for monitoring radiation by a large number of users after March 2011. There was only 1 location streaming into Pachube before the accident, but a large number have since started to stream to the site. The community has converged on a standard way to report the information in order to disseminate the large variety of sources, such as detector model. The manager of developer relations at Pachube said that he foresaw a range of applications of the data, including cell phone applications. He also noted that the sensors will allow people to cross-check readings for accuracy and could inspire healthy skepticism. Pachube has hundreds of Geiger counters streaming, but there are still concerns that these may not be dense enough. In 2012 Pachube was acquired by Cosm which in 2013 was renamed xively. =DataPoke Foundation= The privately operated non- profit organization, DataPoke Foundation, performed independent monitoring of the Fukushima Daiichi NPP contamination dispersion. The project, Project:Fukushima, focuses on publicly publishing data, observations, measurements and dispersion plots of the Fukushima NPP contamination, and aggregating public opinion of these observations in order to reach a more complete understanding of the Fukushima Daiichi NPP catastrophe. =RDTN / Safecast= The RDTN.org began as an early crowd-sourcing initiative to sponsor and assist in gathering, monitoring and disseminating radiation data from the affected areas. RDTN intended their independent measurements to provide additional context for the radiation data reported by the official factors, to supplement and not to replace the data of the competent authorities. RDTN successfully launched a micropatronage campaign to raise $33,000 in order to buy 100 Geiger counters to jumpstart their network. In April hackers at tokyohackerspace prototyped an Arduino-based geiger counter shield to upload data from geiger counters including from RDTN supplied counters. This prototype later developed into Safecast mobile geo-tagged radiation sensors. RDTN people attributed their success to crisis urgency. In late April, one month after its start, RDTN folded itself into Safecast with the joint announcement that RDTN was rebranded as Safecast, a citizens' network which continues monitoring radiation levels in Japan.

Background By capturing Basra, the British had taken an important communications and industrial centre. The British had consolidated their hold on the city and brought in reinforcements. The Ottomans gathered their forces and launched a counteroffensive to retake the city and push the British out of Mesopotamia. The battle The Ottoman commander Süleyman Askeri had about 4,000 regular soldiers, including the Istanbul Fire Brigade Regiment and a large number of irregular Arabs and Kurds, numbering maybe 14,000, for a total of 18,000 personnel.Charles Townsend, Desert Hell, The British Invasion of Mesopotamia (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2010), 84. He chose to attack the British positions around Shaiba, southwest of Basra. Travel between Basra and Shaiba was difficult because seasonal floods had turned the area into a lake, and movement went via boat. The British garrison at Shaiba consisted of about 7,000 men in a fortified camp including a trench and barbed wire. At 5 AM on the 12th, the Ottoman troops started with a bombardment. That evening starting at dusk they tried to crawl through gaps in the British barbed wire, but were repulsed.A.J. Barker, The First Iraq War, 1914-1918, Britain's Mesopotamian Campaign,(Enigma, New York, 2009; originally published in 1967 as The Bastard War(US)/The Neglected War(UK)), 50. By morning of the 13th the Ottoman troops had withdrawn to their positions at Barjisiyeh Wood. Later the next day it was apparent that some Ottomans and Arab irregulars were trying to slip around Shaiba, and maybe get to Basra by bypassing the town. The British, under General Charles Melliss, sent the 7th Hariana Lancers and later the 104th Wellesley's Rifles to attack the Arabs, but those attacks were failures.A.J. Barker, The First Iraq War, 1914-1918, Britain's Mesopotamian Campaign,(Enigma, New York, 2009; originally published in 1967 as The Bastard War(US)/The Neglected War(UK)), 51. Melliss then attacked with the 2nd Dorsets and the 24th Punjabis, backed by artillery fire, and they routed the Arab irregulars, capturing 400 and dispersing the rest. The Arab irregular forces would not take part in the rest of the battle. Sulaimann Askari had his Ottoman regular troops fall back on Barjisiyeh Wood. On 14 April the British left Shaiba to look for the remaining Ottoman forces. They found them at Barjisiyeh Wood. Fighting started at about 10:30 AM and lasted until 5 PM. Melliss had to adjust his forces on the battlefield under fire to bring them to bear on the Ottoman positions. Ottoman fire was intense and by 4 PM the British attack had bogged down.A.J. Barker, The First Iraq War, 1914-1918, Britain's Mesopotamian Campaign,(Enigma, New York, 2009; originally published in 1967 as The Bastard War(US)/The Neglected War(UK)), 53. Men were thirsty and running low on ammunition, and the Ottoman regular troops showed no indication they were going to give up. The Dorsets then launched a bayonet charge on the Ottoman lines that caused the rest of the Indian troops to follow, and the Ottomans were overwhelmed.A.J. Barker, The First Iraq War, 1914-1918, Britain's Mesopotamian Campaign,(Enigma, New York, 2009; originally published in 1967 as The Bastard War(US)/The Neglected War(UK)), 53. They retreated from the battlefield. The British, worn out from the day's fighting with little transportation and with their cavalry tied down elsewhere, did not pursue. Sulaimann Askari would end up committing suicide over the loss, which he blamed on the Arab irregulars and their failure to support him.Charles Townsend, Desert Hell, The British Invasion of Mesopotamia (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2010), 90. On the British side the battle was described as a \\"soldier's battle\\" meaning a hard fought infantry fight, where they, especially the British troops, decided the day.A.J. Barker, The First Iraq War, 1914-1918, Britain's Mesopotamian Campaign,(Enigma, New York, 2009; originally published in 1967 as The Bastard War(US)/The Neglected War(UK)), 54-55. Aftermath British offensive into Southern Mesopotamia, 1915. The battle was important as it was the last time the Ottomans would threaten Basra. After the battle it would be the British who generally held the initiative in Mesopotamia. It also changed Arab attitudes. They began to distance themselves from the Ottomans, and later revolts broke out in Najaf and Karbala up river.Charles Townsend, Desert Hell, The British Invasion of Mesopotamia (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2010), 90-91.

Along with the Mount Cuthbert and Dobbyn Branch Railways, they were essentially built to tap large deposits of copper discovered in the Cloncurry region.  History  Construction of the Selwyn Branch began in 1909. The line ran about 50 kilometres south from Cloncurry railway station () to Malbon railway station () with sidings built en route at Dolomite (), Marimo (), Mitakoodi () and Marraba (). From there it continued south to the Hampden mine and opened on 11 June 1910. The fledgling township was first named Gulatten, then Hampden, then for a brief time Friezland before finally being renamed in 1916 as Kuridala (an Aboriginal word indicating eagle hawk). An extension further south to the Mount Elliott mine at Selwyn opened on 15 December 1910 (along with the Selwyn Range named after Alfred Selwyn, Director of the Geological Survey of Victoria). Smelted copper was railed east and coking coal on return journeys. Cattle and coke also exchanged trips. Falling copper prices forced the closure of the Mount Elliott and Hampden smelters in 1919 and 1920 respectively. The branch continued to operate at a slow pace until it was closed in 1961. Road transport no doubt squeezed out the cattle market. The Dajarra branch ran from Malbon in a south-westerly direction to the small town of Dajarra. Its construction served two purposes. It would immediately provide access to additional copper deposits, and later could contribute to the grand plan to link Sydney and Darwin by inland rail and also be linked to partially built branch lines from Brisbane, Rockhampton and Townsville on Queensland’s east coast. From 1911, some 100 kilometres of the line was surveyed from Malbon to Sulieman’s Creek near Dajarra where it would connect to the proposed inland route. Construction of a 58 kilometre section to the Duchess copper mine began in 1911. Copper was discovered there in 1897 and the Queensland Railways Department adopted Duchess as the station name. Tiny sidings en route included Kundora (), Devoncourt (formerly Macgregor Junction, ), Wammutta (), Dronfield () and Bungalien (). Even though ore was hauled earlier in the year, the line officially opened on 21 October 1912. A short 20 kilometre extension took the line via Jueburra and Woobera to Wills River (possibly named after the explorer William John Wills) and on 18 December 1915 it opened to nearby Butru (an Aboriginal word indicating waterhole where the line crossed Wills River). The balance of the line opened on 16 April 1917 to Carbine Creek renamed Dajarra (reportedly an Aboriginal word indicating isolated mountain nearby). Although substantial construction work began beyond Dajarra towards Camooweal, it was never completed. Traffic on the line between Malbon and Duchess was particularly brisk as it included ore shipped via a private railway from Devoncourt north to Ballara and via a spur line from Juenburra near Duchess south to Trekelano. In 1923 vast silver and lead deposits were discovered at Mount Isa 150 kilometres by road to the north of Dajarra. More business followed in 1929 when Duchess was connected by rail to Mount Isa. So far as Dajarra was concerned, a weekly mixed train plied the route from Cloncurry and Dajarra gradually became one of the world’s largest railheads for cattle transported to eastern meatworks. Supplies from Ballara quickly dwindled and the Trekelano spur lasted until 1943. Competing road transport eventually captured the cattle market and Dajarra railway station () closed when the line from Duchess closed on 1 January 1994. The grand plan of the inland rail link did not eventuate. However, in recent years a plan has been floated to link Queensland with the Northern Territory via Mount Isa and Camooweal in Queensland to the Adelaide-Darwin railway route in the Northern Territory.

Events leading up to radio broadcasts In 1911, more than 1,000 people gathered in downtown Lawrence, Kansas to watch a mechanical reproduction of the 1911 Kansas vs. Missouri football game while it was being played. A Western Union telegraph wire was set up direct from Columbia, Missouri. A group of people then would announce the results of the previous play and used a large model of a football playing field to show the results. Those in attendance cheered as though they were watching the game live, including the school's legendary Rock Chalk, Jayhawk cheer. Radio broadcasts College football games have been broadcast since 1921, beginning with the 1921 West Virginia vs. Pittsburgh football game on October 8 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The first game broadcast nationwide happened the following year, with the 1922 Princeton vs. Chicago football game. The game had Grantland Rice dub Princeton the \\"Team of Destiny.\\" Today, virtually every college football game (at least from Division III on up; junior college, club/junior varsity squads and sprint football teams tend not to have radio coverage) is broadcast on the radio in their local market and many are broadcast nationally. Division III teams may rely on student-run radio stations (or, sometimes, college-owned public radio stations) as their only broadcast outlet, but Division I teams generally garner enough interest to be broadcast not only on commercial radio, but on a network of stations covering a wide region. These regions vary in size and can reflect not only the geography of a fanbase but geographies of US states and culture regions. Other coverage includes local broadcasts of weekly coach's programs. Sports USA Radio Network, Westwood One, Compass Media Networks, ESPN Radio, Touchdown Radio, and Nevada Sports Network all distribute college football broadcasts on a nationwide basis. Additionally Notre Dame and BYU have their games distributed nationally through IMG. Radio broadcasts of Canadian university football are not as consistent. There is generally no national radio broadcasting of university football, much in the same way that the sport is not nationally (or internationally) televised. Teams in mid-sized markets tend to be broadcast on radio, while those in the largest cities or suburbs (where the sport has to compete with much higher-profile professional sports) typically do not. On the Internet, Division I schools tend to place audio streaming of their radio broadcasts behind paywalls.

The Clearwater River flows to the west, Stevens Lakes are to the east, Philip Creek is to the south and Hemp Creek is to the north. Battle Mountain is part of the Shuswap Highland. There are three summits in the group, ranging from to .Neave, Roland (2015). Exploring Wells Gray Park, 6th edition. Wells Gray Tours, Kamloops, BC. .Goward, Trevor and Hickson, Cathie (1995). Nature Wells Gray, 2nd edition. Lone Pine Publishing, Edmonton, AB. . Battle Mountain is accessible by a combination of road and trail. It is a popular summer tourist attraction and is especially noted for colourful alpine meadows. The access trail is longer and more strenuous than the one to nearby Trophy Mountain to the south, so fewer people visit Battle Mountain and the Caribou Meadows. The hike to the meadows can be accomplished as a day outing, but hikers who want to attain Fiftytwo Ridge and Battle Mountain summit should plan for two days and carry overnight equipment. Access Battle Mountain Road turns east off Clearwater Valley Road (also called Wells Gray Park Road) north of the Yellowhead Highway. The gravel road is passable for all vehicles for the first , then it becomes steep and rough; so that a high-clearance vehicle is necessary for the next to the parking lot. A well-used trail starts here. The first section is the steepest and climbs in up the canyon of Philip Creek to a hanging valley where Philip Lake is located. Then it continues at an easier grade, ascending to the beginning of the Caribou Meadows. The trail meanders through the meadows, along the west shore of Fight Lake, then climbs to the top of Fiftytwo Ridge. Beyond there, it is a hiking route through meadows and rock which first descends into Bull Valley, then climbs onto Battle Mountain itself. The hiking season on Battle Mountain is from late June through September. Origin of names *Battle Mountain: The names \\"Battle Mountain\\", \\"Battle Creek\\", \\"Fight Lake\\" and \\"Indian Valley\\" all arise from a legendary Indian battle between the Chilcotin and Shuswap bands around 1875. In the mid- nineteenth century, great herds of caribou migrated each spring through the Clearwater Valley in an east-west direction. The Chilcotin Indians dominated most of the migration route, except for the Battle Mountain area where the Canim Lake band and the Shuswap band at Chu Chua hunted. At some of the small lakes on the floor of Indian Valley, the Chilcotins built long wire and stone fences leading to a narrow opening on the lakeshore. The caribou were then chased through the V-shaped traps into the water and speared as they swam to shore. The battle took place near these traps and was apparently a showdown over the caribou hunting grounds, since the numbers of animals began to decrease around this time. *Fiftytwo Ridge: Named because a biological study by Pat Martin and Ralph Ritcey was conducted there in 1952. *Philip Creek: Named for Clearwater Valley land-owners William and Ella Philip. *Mount Philip: Although near the head of Philip Creek, it was named for Mr. C. Philips, an assistant on Robert Lee's 1914 land survey of the Clearwater Valley and Murtle Plateau. *Stevens Lakes: This chain of six lakes along Snookwa Creek is east of Battle Mountain and near the treeline. The lakes are named for Whitney W. \\"Pat\\" Stevens of the British Columbia Forest Service who conducted a forest reconnaissance survey in the Clearwater Valley in 1921. He was 22 that summer, a graduate of the University of New Brunswick, and spent most of his life in forestry work. He died in 1960.

He served in National Assembly of Quebec from 1981 to 1998 as a member of the Parti Québécois (PQ). Early life and career Blais was born in Saint-Placide, Quebec and raised in Rouyn-Noranda, in the Témiscamingue area. He took classical studies at College Mont-Laurier and received a bachelor's degree in literature in 1950.Karen Palmer, \\"Longtime separatist worked tirelessly for cause: Health problems took a back seat\\", Ottawa Citizen, 24 November 1988, A6. Blais worked for Hydro-Québec from 1951 to 1966, initially in land surveying and later at the installations department of the company's main office. He also studied in journalism, communications, administration, and social work in Montreal during the 1960s and opened a series of nightclubs and coffee houses, including the Patriote de Montréal, the Théâtre de Saint-Sauveur, and the Comédie nationale.Mike Shahin, \\"Yves Blais, the Yes side's man in the Outaouais: A die-hard separatist\\", Ottawa Citizen, 6 October 1995, C1. He became a Quebec nationalist in his youth and joined the Rassemblement pour l'Indépendance Nationale (RIN) on the recommendation of party leader Pierre Bourgault in the 1960s. He also rented space in his Montreal nightclub to René Lévesque, who merged his own Mouvement Souveraineté-Association with the RIN and a third group to create the Parti Québécois in 1969.Mike Shahin, \\"Yves Blais, the Yes side's man in the Outaouais: A die-hard separatist\\", Ottawa Citizen, 6 October 1995, C1. Legislator ;Government backbencher Blais was elected to the Quebec legislature for the Terrebonne division in the 1981 provincial election. The Parti Québécois won a majority government in this election, and Blais entered the legislature as a backbench supporter of René Lévesque's government. He served on the party's executive during the mid-1980s. In 1981, the federal government of Pierre Trudeau reached an agreement with all provincial premiers except Lévesque to patriate the Canadian constitution. Lévesque was not included in the final negotiations (which took place overnight at a constitutional summit in Ottawa) and described the agreement as a betrayal. In a subsequent legislative debate, Blais likened the constitutional agreement to the 1759 battle of the Plains of Abraham and compared Trudeau and the other premiers to General James Wolfe, who \\"climbed the banks of the Saint Lawrence in the middle of the night to attack Montcalm and his sleeping soldiers.\\"Graham Fraser, PQ: René Lévesque & the Parti Québécois in Power, (Toronto: MacMillan of Canada), 1984, p. 302. It may be noted that the battle of the Plains of Abraham is generally regarded in the Quebec sovereigntist movement as having led to the subjugation of the Quebecois people. The PQ faced an extremely divisive internal debate as to its position on Quebec independence in 1984. Some party members favoured a hardline stance, while others sought to win increased autonomy for Quebec within the Canadian federation (a position known as the \\"beau risque\\"). Blais was not regarded as a hardliner in this period; he argued that the terms \\"separatist\\", \\"indépendantiste\\", and \\"sovereigntist\\" had different meanings and said that the PQ was \\"sovereigntist in a Canadian economic whole.\\"Graham Fraser, \\"More PQ spokesmen join policy debate\\", Globe and Mail, 29 October 1984, p. 3. The \\"beau risque\\" supporters won the debate (in the short term), and several of the more militant Péquistes left the party. Blais served as parliamentary assistant to the minister of cultural communities and immigration from February 12 to October 23, 1985. ;Opposition backbencher Blais was re-elected in the 1985 provincial election as the PQ was defeated by the Quebec Liberal Party. Fe was appointed as the PQ's environment critic in the official opposition after the election.\\"Quebec wants U.S. promise on emissions\\", Globe and Mail, 2 April 1987, A4. He criticized the Liberal government's passage of a law guaranteeing English-language health and social services in 1985, on the grounds that it would give Quebec's anglophone population the \\"hope of becoming once again a dominant minority.\\"Bertrand Marotte, \\"Legislation guarantees English services\\", 19 December 1986, A14. Blais fell out with PQ party leader Pierre-Marc Johnson in 1987, after Johnson attempted to shift him from the environmental portfolio and subsequently dropped him from the shadow cabinet entirely.Don Macpherson, \\"Johnson began to hear the giggles\\", Montreal Gazette, 10 September 1987, B3. Blais subsequently became affiliated with a dissident group of legislators who opposed Johnson's leadership, and, after Johnson resigned, he supported hardline indépendantiste Jacques Parizeau's successful bid to lead the party.Robert McKenzie, \\"PQ leader faces caucus revolt in the wake of Levesque's death\\", Toronto Star, 10 November 1987, A2; Benoit Aubin, \\"Parizeau's promise jolts PQ old guard\\", Globe and Mail, 19 January 1988, A5. In the years that followed, Blais himself became more aligned the party's hardline separatist position. He was co-president of the PQ's fundraising efforts in early 1988.\\"Parizeau experiences dissension within PQ\\", Ottawa Citizen, 19 January 1988, A3. He was elected to a third term in the Quebec legislature in the 1989 provincial election, running in the division of Masson after boundary changes. The Liberals were re-elected with a second consecutive majority government, and Blais was appointed as the PQ's communications critic.Bill Taylor, \\"No time for farewells as TV stations pull plug\\", Toronto Star, 6 December 1990, A13. In 1990, he unsuccessfully called for the PQ to boycott premier Robert Bourassa's commission on Quebec's constitutional future.Philip Authier, \\"Bourassa packing constitutional panel with federalists: Parizeau\\", Montreal Gazette, 12 October 1990, A6. ;Government backbencher (second time) Blais was re-elected again in the 1994 provincial election as the PQ returned to power until Parizeau's leadership. Following the election, he was appointed as the government's regional delegate for the Outaouais. This was not a ministerial position, although Parizeau said that it would be almost equal in power. One day after his appointment, Blais announced that he would make a decision on the location of a promised casino for the Outaouais within ten days and that the PQ government would act on his decision.Elizabeth Thompson, \\"Montreal won't be overlooked Laurin says\\", Montreal Gazette, 27 September 1994, B1; Mike Shahin, \\"PQ to decide casino site in 10 days\\", Ottawa Citizen, 28 September 1994, B1.

Blais subsequently indicated that only companies with offices in Quebec would be able to work on the building's construction.David Pugliese, \\"HULL CASINO: Construction could start in weeks\\", Ottawa Citizen, 26 December 1994, D2. Blais campaigned in favour of Quebec sovereignty in the Outaouais region in the buildup to the 1995 provincial referendum and highlighted the need for the Parizeau government to ensure that federal civil service workers would have job security in a sovereign Quebec.Mike Shahin, \\"PQ backtracks on guarantee of federal jobs\\", Ottawa Citizen, 11 December 1994, A1. In January 1995, he promised that the PQ would soon provide \\"irrefutable proof\\" that all federal civil servants would be hired by the Quebec public service in the event of Quebec sovereignty.Mike Shahin, \\"PQ reaffirms plan to hire federal public servants in Outaouais\\", 24 January 1995, B1.

Blais also took part in the Parizeau government's public commission on sovereignty during the same period.Mike Shahin, \\"PLAYING FAVORITES: PQ dogmatism taints integrity of sovereignty hearings\\", Ottawa Citizen, 11 February 1995, C1.

See also Bob Phillips, \\"Blais heart attack displays problems with Quebec health care\\", Ottawa Citizen, 10 March 1995, C3. Fellow legislator Denis Perron said as Blais, \\"\`For him, it's Quebec before everything else. Before himself, before his health.\\" Blais himself said, \\"Politics and humor are my two drugs. That's what keeps me alive. That, and the hope of having a new country very soon.\\"Mike Shahin, \\"Yves Blais, the Yes side's man in the Outaouais: A die-hard separatist\\", Ottawa Citizen, 6 October 1995, C1. During Quebec's legislative debates on sovereignty in 1995, Blais compared Quebecers to the Jewish people in their search for a homeland, saying \\"We lost a war in 1760 and have been searching for a country since then.\\"Andre Picard, \\"QUEBEC'S FORGOTTEN DEBATE Speeches of their lives, spoken from the heart\\", Globe and Mail, 23 September 1995, A6. The sovereigntist side was narrowly defeated in the referendum, and Parizeau resigned as premier shortly thereafter. When Lucien Bouchard succeeded Parizeau as premier in January 1996, one of his first decisions was to eliminate the \\"regional delegate\\" positions. He appointed Blais as parliamentary assistant to the minister responsible for regional development on January 29, 1996; Blais held this position for the remainder of his time as a legislator.. He was styled as parliamentary assistant to the minister for the regions after April 1, 1998. Death Blais died of a heart attack on November 22, 1998. At the time, he was seeking re-election to the Quebec legislature in the 1998 provincial election. Premier Bouchard cancelled some campaign appearances as a tribute to Blais.Karen Palmer, \\"Longtime separatist worked tirelessly for cause: Health problems took a back seat\\", Ottawa Citizen, 24 November 1988, A6.

Through its medical relief and development projects, CMAT seeks to improve the health and welfare of families both in Canada and in developing countries around the world. History Canadian Medical Assistance Teams was established in 2004 in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami as the medical arm of Canadian Relief Foundation. Two teams of paramedics from British Columbia and Saskatchewan were deployed to Banda Aceh, Indonesia to provide medical aid to the victims of the disaster. With lessons learned in Indonesia, CMAT prepared for further deployments. Deployments CMAT has a database of over 1000 health professionals from across Canada, one of its strengths is the ability to be flexible. CMAT is firmly dedicated to building capacity in the communities provided with assistance, and so any project which is initiated will only be in direct partnership with local authorities and with the support, guidance and permission of the host government. =2004= 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami was the first time CMAT sent medical teams overseas. Over the course of eight weeks, three Canadian medical teams consisting of paramedics and physicians were deployed to Indonesia, with the first team deploying within 10 days of disaster. CMAT's medical team worked alongside teams from Mercy Malaysia and collaborated with Canadian consular officials from Jakarta, Indonesia and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to establish medical stations and administer medical care and first aid to displaced persons in Medan, Banda Aceh, and Meuloboh, Indonesia. =2005= Hurricane Katrina On August 29, 2005, the Category 3 storm made landfall in southeast Louisiana. It caused severe destruction along the Gulf coast from central Florida to Texas, much of it due to the storm surge. CMAT deployed an assessment team to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. After three days in the Area of Operations (AOO) and completion of an on-ground tactical assessment, it was determined that CMAT's trauma team of physicians, trauma nurses and flight paramedics should not be deployed to the area. The two-member assessment team cited significant political infighting and substantial lack of command and control structure, which together posed serious problems for logistical support and basic information. 2005 Kashmir earthquake On October 8, 2005, a major earthquake registered a moment magnitude of 7.6 in Azad Kashmir, near the city of Muzaffarabad in Pakistan. Occurring at 08:52:37 Pakistan Standard Time, it registered a moment magnitude of 7.6 The disaster destroyed 50% of the buildings in Muzaffarabad (including most of the official buildings) and is estimated to have killed up to 80,000 people in the Pakistani-controlled areas of Kashmir, alone. The severity of the damage caused by the earthquake is attributed to severe upthrust, coupled with poor construction. CMAT focused its efforts in northern Pakistan, initially in Bagh and Muzaffarabad areas sending an assessment team from Canada on October 10, consisting of search and rescue, logistics and paramedics, as well as an emergency physician. In addition, CMAT's staff in Kabul, Afghanistan conducted an assessment in affected areas in eastern Afghanistan. This initial assessment team was followed by ten rotations of teams every three weeks, the second of which departed on October 21, 2005. The teams initially worked alongside members of the Rotary Club of Islamabad and Rawalpindi to deliver emergency medical relief, and assist and support medical staff at hospitals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi which had been deluged with quake victims airlifted from the field. Subsequent teams were stationed in Muzaffarabad, working out of Abbass hospital, and in collaboration with the US Army's 212th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) Hospital, and in Garhi Dopatta, working with the Canadian Forces Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) Team, and United Nations Health Cluster. On November 3, 2005, CMAT announced that it has been awarded over $190,000 in funding for two of its projects as part of the fund matching program through the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). The funds were sent to support medical teams in Muzzafferabad and other quake devastated areas. =2007= 2007 South Asian floods The 2007 South Asian floods were a series of floods in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. News Agencies, citing the Indian and Bangladeshi governments, placed the death toll in excess of 2,000. By 3 August approximately 20 million had been displaced and by 10 August some 30 million people in India, Bangladesh and Nepal had been affected by flooding. CMAT deployed a 2-member assessment team to Dhaka, Bangladesh to meet its local partner on August 18, 2007. According to CMAT assessment team, doctors and nurses were overwhelmed at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh hospital, as over 1800 patients were being seen every 24 hours with acute GI distress, typhoid, skin and eye infections and severe dehydration with outside temperatures reaching 33 degrees Celsius. A four-member team consisting of advanced care paramedics and a nurse practitioner were deployed to Bangladesh, in collaboration with a local partner Fazlullah Foundation, and spent three weeks providing medical relief in Gopalganj District (Bangladesh), one of the most flood affected areas in Bangladesh alongside the Bangladesh Auxiliary Services for Social Advancement (BASSA). CMAT also endorsed the activities of the Dhaka Project - a grassroots humanitarian project started by Ms. Maria Conceicao, a flight attendant for Emirates Airways. Conceicao was so moved by the plight of Dhaka's homelessness and poverty that she spearheaded the Dhaka Project, a program to alleviate homelessness, unemployment and disease through sustainable educational projects, employment training of men and women, nursery programs, and medical clinics. CMAT supported the project with a grant of US$8,000. =2008= 2008 Sichuan earthquake, China CMAT deployed their assessment team to the province of Sichuan in China, where an earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale occurred on May 12, 2008 at approximately 14:00 local time. Reports indicated over 68,000 people died, including many school children trapped in collapsed school buildings. The assessment team conducted an in- depth assessment of the region, partnering with contacts on the ground, and advised that the Chinese government, military and local Red Cross had done a commendable job in the rescue and recovery effort. With over 100,000 Chinese Military and over 1000 medical staff in the region, the most seriously injured citizens had already been evacuated to larger centres. CMAT's offer of providing medical teams to the area was declined by Government officials, and it was on their advice that CMAT has decided to immediately shift the focus of the relief effort in China. CMAT investigated other projects which were completed with donor funding. In 2010, CMAT Chair visited the temporary home of the Mianyang Youxian District Special Education School, and presented a cheque for ¥85,000 (approx $12,500 CAD). =2010= 2010 Haiti earthquake, Haiti A magnitude 7.0 quake with countless aftershocks struck the island nation of Haïti on January 12, 2010. Nearly 300,000 people perished in the highly populated Caribbean nation, and an assessment team was immediately deployed to the impoverished nation. The earthquake, centered 15 km from the capitol of Port-au-Prince caused tremendous devastation to vast areas of the country. CMAT's initial assessment team conducted intense reconnaissance in the capitol and in the environs, meeting with United Nations officials, and other partner organizations. In collaboration with Canadian Armed Forces, CMAT based its field hospital operation in the city of Léogâne, approximately 35 southwest from Port-au-Prince.ReliefWeb, 2010 Over the course of two months, CMAT's medical volunteers assessed and treated over 10,000 patients, performed hundreds of surgeries, and delivered approximately 20 babies. In March 2010, CMAT wrapped up its operations in Léogâne, and transitioned its medical teams to Pétion-Ville, working in partnership with J/P Haitian Relief Organization, a non-governmental organization founded by actor Sean Penn. Teams of volunteers rotated through an additional four months. In partnership with the York Region District School Board, approximately $75,000 was raised directly for CMAT's relief effort. 2010 Chile earthquake A powerful 8.8 magnitude quake and ensuing tsunamis struck the area on February 27, 2010. Over 700 people were confirmed dead, and countless others were injured. In response to the Chilean government's international appeal for aid, Canadian Medical Assistance Teams deployed its initial disaster assessment team to Concepción, Chile to conduct a needs assessment and ascertain the level of devastation, destroyed infrastructure and health needs of the quake affected people. After meeting with Chilean officials, in Concepción, the decision was made stand down deployment. This decision was made as a direct result of the Chilean Government and Military's exceptional response to the earthquake. The assessment team found that the need for medical aid was decreasing on a daily basis, any victims with traumatic injuries had been evacuated to major medical centres in other regions of the country, and thus the recommendation to stand down was made. 2010 Pakistan floods In the late summer of 2010, major flooding from monsoon rains killed up to 1,500 people, put over 100,000 at risk for disease and displaced more than 3.2 million in central Pakistan. The threat of water-borne diseases rapidly rose and millions of people were homeless or cut off in their villages because of the heavy monsoon rains and flooding. CMAT received word from its Pakistani partners on the ground, reporting that rescue workers are struggling to aid the millions of people affected, especially those in far-flung villages. CMAT members were familiar with the region, having responded and provided medical relief after the devastating earthquake of October, 2005. The 2010 monsoon season which started on July 27 brought the worst flooding in Pakistan in living memory, causing widespread damage and making many communities inaccessible due to destroyed roads and collapsed bridges. Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa (KPK) (especially many areas of Swat District), Baluchistan and Punjab were the worst-affected areas. Thousands of people lost their homes and livelihoods, officials from Save the Children and Pakistan Red Crescent have reported. Flood hit areas of Swat had limited access to health services. A number of health facilities in certain locations, were completely destroyed. Furthermore, as many were cut off from main towns in Swat, communities were unable to access health services when needed, while others were able access health facilities with some difficulties. However, most communities reported that injured and sick community members did not receive any medical treatment. Pregnant women in particular were facing problems in accessing health services. The most prevalent ailments were diarrhea, respiratory infections, skin diseases and fever. As floodwaters moved through Sindh Province, additional flooding occurred in low-lying areas, and the incidence of disease swiftly increased. Canadian Medical Assistance Teams deployed its initial disaster assessment team to Sindh Province, Pakistan from Toronto on September 5, 2010. The assessment surveyed the health needs of displaced flood victims in order to prepare for the deployment of CMAT's inflatable field hospital and rotations of medical teams. The five member team begun its assessment of the southern part of Sindh Province, worked in the town of Thatta. The town was one of the worst flooded districts of Pakistan, as the sea was on high tide when flooded river water reached it, multiplying the damage drastically. By late August, 175,000 people had left their homes and were camping along the sides of the main road under the open sky. Three primary health care teams were sent to Sindh province, and indicated that the majority of illnesses were primary care related - such as skin infections, respiratory infections, eye infections, and gastrointestinal illnesses. CMAT also provided mobile medical clinics to the outlying areas, to target women and children who would otherwise be unable to access health services. In collaboration with Pakistani Federal and Provincial authorities, and other NGO partners on the ground, the team also identified an area in Sukkur, Sindh Province, approximately a 500 km north of Karachi. The immediate vicinity is home to 5-6 internally displace persons (IDP) camps, with population of several thousand. CMAT volunteers treated more than 500 patients per week in the field clinic in collaboration with local partner V Need U. =2011= 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Japan The largest earthquake in Japan's recorded history struck offshore on March 11, and police found as many as 300 bodies in the north-eastern coastal area that bore the brunt of the tremors and ensuing tsunami. The earthquake struck at 2:46 p.m. local time at a depth of 10 kilometres about 125 kilometres off the eastern coast, and was followed by at least 19 powerful aftershocks. CMAT's Rapid Assessment Team was activated, and conducted a needs assessment in the Miyagi Prefecture, around the city of Sendai to ascertain the level of devastation. This assessment included evaluating the destroyed infrastructure and surveying the health needs of the earthquake and tsunami affected victims in order to prepare for the potential deployment of CMAT's inflatable field hospital. NGO airlift support had been temporarily suspended pending the further assessment of the situation at the Fukushima Nuclear Plant. CMAT Directors spoke with Canadian Nuclear Officials who stated: \\"Standard Personal Protective Equipment (PPE: coveralls, masks, gloves) would be adequate if they had to go inside the evacuated area, but at 100+ km away, no one would have received a significant radiation dose, even at Chernoble.\\" The Canadian Nuclear Official was also confident that only small amounts of radioactive material were recently released in Japan, and in a controlled manner. CMAT re- deployed with medical volunteers who were trained in CBRNE (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive) events. CBRNE events refer to the uncontrolled release of chemicals, biological agents or radioactive contamination into the environment or explosions that cause widespread damage. CMAT Team members who deployed to Japan will have been trained in CBRNE capabilities, common standards, policies and protective equipment. Working with guidance from experts at the Centre for Excellence in Emergency Preparedness, under Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission guidelines and using principles from the CBRNE strategy, all CMAT team members who deployed to Japan were equipped with personal protective equipment, such as dosimeters, and radiation detectors. Other personal protective equipment which the teams will carried included a full supply of Tyvek coveralls, nitrile gloves, protective eyewear, shoe covers and masks, generously donated by a supplier partner. The team made their way to Ishinomaki, a small coastal town north of Sendai in the Miyagi prefecture. They spent a chilly and rocky night, with several aftershocks ranging from 5.0 to 6.6 and spent the day assessing the devastated area, where search and rescue missions are still going on, and attended a briefing meeting. Several of the members spent time working in a recovery centre, where there were quite a few patients. A 5-member strike team collaborated with the Japanese military in the coastal town of Onagawa, approximately 15 km east of Ishinomaki and were asked to assist with the search and recovery of victims in this small community which was flattened by the tsunami. Working their way through broken homes, rubble and bamboo forests, the team reported that in this area the waves were well over 100 feet high and deposited debris into the branches of tall trees. Of the estimated 15,000 people who lived in this community before the tsunami, only about 300 survived the disaster. The situation in Japan was reminiscent of CMAT's first deployment in response to the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004. Just like Indonesia, countless numbers of people in Japan perished in the disaster, and those who did survive, escaped largely unharmed. The medical team visited evacuation centres provided primary medical care and first aid to some of the evacuees, as the few patients who survived with major or significant injuries had already been evacuated. Many of the patients that the team saw were elderly, and had chronic illnesses like diabetes and high blood pressure. Meanwhile, other members of the team were awaiting delivery of the Nomad water purification unit. The purchase of this portable water purification system manufactured by Noah Water Systems was made possible through the generous support of our donors, especially the Lotus Light Charity Society from Vancouver, and the \\"Helping Hands\\" program run by the York Region District School Board. The unit is capable of producing 25 gallons / 95 litres per minute or 36,000 gallons / 136,800 liters per day and will satisfy the need for large volumes of safe drinking water using any fresh water source: well, lake, river, stream, and pond and even polluted floodwaters. The Nomad unit was delivered to the team in Ishinomaki in collaboration with the Japanese military, and the decision was made to place the Nomad in the community of Kitakamicho Aikawa, a small fishing village of about 1000 people, which was completely destroyed by the tsunami. The unit supplied the whole community with safe drinking water as the water reservoir and most of the water supply infrastructure was washed away in the tsunami. Local authorities and military estimated that it would take at least six months before the system is back up and running again. The nomad supplied water for the community during the period of reconstruction.

Biography  Ritter was born Anna Nuhn in Coburg, Bavaria, (then part of the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha) on February 23, 1865, but she was only a young child when her father, an export trader, moved the family to New York City. The young Anna returned to Europe in 1869 to attend boarding schools in Kassel and at a Moravian boarding school in the hamlet of Montmirail in the French-speaking canton of Neuchâtel, Switzerland. She completed her education in Kassel where she married a future civil servant, Rudolf Ritter in 1884. The couple moved first to Cologne and later to Berlin and Münster. Her husband died in 1893, and the widow moved to the spa town of Bad Frankenhausen in Thuringia. She published her first collection of poetry in 1898 and a second collection followed in 1900. In that same year she found employment with the weekly journal, Die Gartenlaube, which had previously published her poetry. She published a novel, Margharita in 1902 followed by a travel diary. Her most famous poem is \\"Denkt euch, ich habe das Christkind geseh'n\\" (I think I saw the Christ Child). She belonged to a group of writers commissioned by Cologne-based Ludwig Stollwerck chocolate producers to produce literature for a series of collectable print albums and scrapbooks. Other authors included the poet \\"T. Resa,\\" (Gröhe Theresa), zoologist Paul Matschie, Hans Eschelbach, journalist Julius Rodenburg, writer Joseph von Lauff, poet Carl Hermann Busse, and the novelist Gustav Falke, among others. Ritter died on October 31, 1921, in Marburg. Ritters style is lyric, and it aligns with lyric styles of several turn of the century German poets – saturated with symbolism and influenced by folklore and a New Romanticism. Composers to set her poems to music include Max Reger, Jean Sibelius, and Kurt Weill, among others.

This town is located on the main route between Belgrade and Sarajevo along the banks of River Jadar. The town was settled around Musa-Paša Mosque (1643) which was proclaimed a National Monument in 1951. History The first mention of this town can be traced back to the year of 1641, when Kara Musa Pasha, the Turkish Grand Vizier, asked for a permission to build a mosque and Han (Caravanserai) in the Bosnian Sanjak Municipality, Birač district in the vicinity of the Gojković village. The argument was that Han existed there but it got burned so daily travelers were forced to use local housing for rest and sleepover. This situation created major issues with locals who were slowly forced out from their homes and eventually most of them moved out from the area. With this argument, Kara Musa-Pasha, was granted the building plan and settlement permit. The construction begun on 16 September 1641 and was completed on 29 May 1643.

He replaced the band's former drummer, John Kiffmeyer, in 1990 as Kiffmeyer felt that he should focus on college. Cool has also played in The Lookouts, Samiam, Dead Mermaids, Bubu and the Brood and the Green Day side projects The Network and the Foxboro Hot Tubs. Life and career Frank Edwin Wright III was born in Frankfurt, West Germany, to American parents Frank Edwin Wright Jr. and Linda Wright. He lived in Willits, California, with his father and elder sister Lori. He has German heritage, and his father was a helicopter pilot during the Vietnam War. Wright's closest neighbor was Larry Livermore, who at the time was the singer of the punk band The Lookouts. When Wright was 12, Livermore recruited him as the drummer of The Lookouts and Tre took on the name of \\"Tré Cool,\\" using both the French word \\"très\\" (meaning \\"very\\") and the English word \\"cool\\" as a way of saying he was \\"very cool.\\" Trey, a play on Wright's family's generational titles, had already been Wright's nickname prior to the addition of \\"Cool.\\" When Green Day's drummer, John Kiffmeyer, left the band, the group recruited Tré Cool to be their drummer. In his second year, Tré Cool dropped out of high school and opted to earn a GED. He began taking classes at a local community college but would again drop out as the band became a more time-consuming priority. During this time the band considered breaking up because it took a long time to adjust to playing with Tré Cool. Tré Cool's father was supportive and overhauled a bookmobile to transport the band. He would later say: \\"I watched them go from a bunch of kids to a group of musicians with work ethic,\\" also adding: \\"On their first tour or two, it was more of a party than anything else. I still scratch my head and say, 'How in the hell did they make it?' They used to practice in my living room here – a lot of the songs they did on Dookie. You hear it coming together, and you don't expect people are going to go out and buy it. But when it does, you just say, 'Wow that's so cool.'\\"Rolling Stone, January 26, 1995 In 1998, after Green Day won a \\"Moon Man\\" Trophy at the MTV Music Awards, Tré Cool famously climbed on the Universal Globe at Universal Studios. He and Jai Brooks are the only two people to ever do this. Tré Cool won \\"Best Punk Drummer\\" in DRUM! Magazine's 2011 Drummies, which recognizes some of the best drummers across music genres. He was also featured in the Nitpick Six: The Six Best Drum Fills and ranked in at number 6 for the intro to \\"Basket Case\\".Wasoba, Ryan. (October 24, 2011) . Blogs.riverfronttimes.com Retrieved on 2019-12-25. In 2014, LA Weekly named Tré Cool #2 of the \\"Top 5 Punk Drummers of All Time.\\" Musical style Before joining Green Day, Tré Cool employed a more intricate drumming style. He explained that \\"When I started, I had too many drums. I was a little reggae- happy and into fancier beats than was needed. It took me a while to get it: play the song, don't play the instrument. I started figuring out how to make the band a stronger unit, to make it jump.\\" After playing with Green Day bassist Mike Dirnt, Tré Cool adopted a more rhythmic style with fewer drum fills to match Dirnt's bass lines. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune referred to Tré Cool as \\"Green Day's most potent weapon\\", adding that \\"His monstrous kick- drum wallop evokes John Bonham, while his manic fills make him punk's answer to Keith Moon.\\" His stage persona has also been compared to Moon. Sound engineer Neill King, who worked with Green Day on Dookie, noted that Tré Cool shares Moon's \\"wild animal approach\\" to playing drums, and explained that the band encountered difficulties while recording \\"Basket Case\\" due to his unpredictable style: \\"It's not that Tré wasn’t a good drummer, but in terms of his performances we wanted the best of the best...So, although we wanted him to do all of his wild fills and crazy drumming, we couldn’t just let him go. He’d drift in and out of time, which is terrific live, but which was unacceptable on radio at that time.\\" Influences and favorite drummers During a speech at Green Day's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2015, Cool credited Ringo Starr from The Beatles, Keith Moon from The Who, John Bonham from Led Zeppelin, Mitch Mitchell from The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Charlie Watts from The Rolling Stones, jazz and big band drummer Buddy Rich, John Wright from NoMeansNo, Alex Van Halen from Van Halen and Dave Mello from Operation Ivy as his favourite drummers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZQaFpSvoGs Green Day performed the Beatles hit \\"Boys\\" with Starr at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony that same year, in which Cool drummed alongside his idol.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mx48CPaQFo Singing and songwriting He also sang on \\"That Girl's from Outer Space\\" and \\"Sonny Boy\\" from Lookouts album Spy Rock Road. He then sang and played the guitar on \\"Dominated Love Slave\\" from Kerplunk and the hidden track \\"All by Myself\\" from Dookie, both of which he wrote and composed (on \\"Dominated Love Slave\\", guitarist and vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong played drums). He wrote and sang the subtrack \\"Rock and Roll Girlfriend\\" from the medley \\"Homecoming\\" featured on the album American Idiot. He also sang and wrote the track \\"DUI\\" (\\"Driving Under the Influence\\"), which was recorded for Green Day's fifth studio album Nimrod (1997) and was due to be released on the compilation album Shenanigans in 2002, but was omitted and can only be found on promotional unmastered copies of the album and online. During a radio interview at Washington DC's alternative station DC 101, Tré Cool sang and played acoustic guitar on a short song entitled \\"Like a Rat Does Cheese,\\" a song about the pleasure of fellatio. Several live tracks also exist, usually from around 1993, such as \\"Food Around the Corner\\", a song from the 1943 Elmer Fudd cartoon An Itch in Time. Another live track, \\"Billie Joe's Mom\\" was also recorded. Tré Cool has also recorded a version of Tay Zonday's \\"Chocolate Rain.\\" Discography * Kerplunk!

Based in Melbourne, Australia and owned by Omio. History Rome2rio was founded by Bernhard Tschirren and Dr. Michael Cameron, two ex-Microsoft software engineers. The site was born out of their frustrations with the lack of a fast, easy-to-use, and comprehensive multi- modal search engine with global coverage. The two co-founders began work on the product in September 2010 and won the Melbourne Azure Bizspark Camp Award in February 2011. The beta version of Rome2rio was launched on 7 April 2011. Rod Cuthbert, founder of Viator, became CEO in May 2012 as the company raised $450,000. Rome2rio won the People's Choice Award at Phocuswright 2012, the TRAVELtech GlobalCollect Website of the Year in 2013, the Data Specialist Award at the 2015 WITovation Awards and the Best Metasearch Award at the 2016 Travolution Awards. The company raised $2.8 million in funding including a 2014 grant of $1.2 million from Commercialisation Australia. In July 2015, it announced that support for its white label product would cease in January 2016, citing pressure on development resources brought on by rapid growth in its consumer business. The company initially offered both white-label products and application programming interface options for partners wishing to integrate its multi-modal results into web sites and mobile apps. In 2016, the company added direct booking options. In April 2017, Rod Cuthbert became Executive Chairman, Michael Cameron became CEO and Bernie Tschirren was made Chief Architect.

Early life He was born on 15 July 1952 in London, by Greek Cypriot parents, and moved to Cyprus at the age of 3. His family originates from the Famagusta District which is currently under Turkish occupation. He attended the Grammar School Nicosia from where he graduated in 1970 and after serving his obligatory military service in the Cyprus National Guard he left for London again where he studied law at the University of North London. In July 1974, during a summer vacation visit to Cyprus he was caught in the war (Turkish invasion of Cyprus) where as an officer in the reserves he defended the Nicosia Airport as well as the area of his own old school. At the end of the war, he returned to England to continue his studies and he later attended the Middle Temple Inn to become a Barrister-at-law. In 1980, after the birth of his first child, he returned to Cyprus with his French wife to begin his legal and political career. Legal career On his return to Cyprus, he trained under Barrister-at-law Andreas Dikigoropoulos and became a licensed member of the Cyprus Bar Association in 1980. While practicing law, he also taught law at the then I.M.C.S. Intercollege (now the University of Nicosia) for 16 year and was also an examiner for the ATT London Examinations and the Institute of Banking. Leaving the office of Dikigoropoulos he proceeded to co-found a new law firm, eventually named Elides – Paschalides & Co which operated for 27 years (1980–2007). On 1 October 2007, the partnership was terminated and he formed a new partnership under his own name, Antonis Paschalides & Co which runs until today despite his absence as a successful Cyprus law firm on both local and international matters. While still practicing he had been elected as a member of the Executive Committee of the Nicosia Bar Association for 15 years in a row. Political career He first became involved in politics in the UK where he was the first non-British to be elected as President of the Student Union of West Ham College. On his return to Cyprus after his studies he became actively involved in the National Committee of Support of the Enclaved and was one of the founding members of the Refugee Associations “Eleftheri Eniaia Karpassia” (Free United Karpasia) and “Eleftheroi Yialousites” (Free Yialousa people). Amongst others including the later President of the Republic of Cyprus Tassos Papadopoulos he co- founded the political party “Enosi Kentrou” which was later absorbed by DIKO of which he stayed a member until 2000. In 1988 he was appointed Member of the Air Transport Authority by the Council of Ministers (then under the Presidency of George Vassiliou) a position he held until February 1998. In 2000 after a disagreement on party policies he left to form a new political party “Komma Evrodimokratikis Ananeosis” which was later absorbed back into DIKO in 2003. He later became a member of the Central and the Executive Committees of DIKO, positions he still holds, and in February 2008, after the election of Demetris Christofias to the Presidency by the coalition of AKEL, DIKO and EDEK, he was appointed as Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism. Policies Antonis Paschalides is considered a very hands-on politician with important connections to the Middle East and ex Soviet countries. The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism is responsible for around 70% of the GNP of the Republic of Cyprus and other than Commerce, Industry and Tourism it is also responsible for Energy, Technology, the Cyprus Registrar of Companies and Coop Banking in Cyprus. =Energy in Cyprus= Antonis Paschalides vigorously sought to bring changes to the still oil based energy production of Cyprus and during his first 3 years as Minister responsible for Energy, the country saw huge changes which put it on the world energy map. a. He brought forwardhttp://www.financialmirror.com/News/Business_and_Finance/22222 the issue of switching the energy production of Cyprus from oil to natural gas, a topic which had been in discussion for years but never actually dealt with.HighBeam b. For years it was believed that the Cyprus sea was rich in the resources of oil and natural gas, but was never investigated. Antonis Paschalides proceeded to have the Cyprus sea bed testedhttp://www.financialmirror.com/News/Business_and_Finance/22667 and entered an agreement with Noble Energyhttp://www.hri.org/news/cyprus/cna/2011/11-02-15_1.cna.html for the exploitation of these resources.http://www.offshoreenergytoday.com/noble- energy-to-start-drilling-offshore-cyprus-early-2012/ c. He is considered one of the masterminds behind the signing of an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) with Lebanonhttp://www.hri.org/news/cyprus/cna/2010/10-09-23_2.cna.html and Israel where in a visit in March 2011 he was welcomed as Mr. Energy and Mr. Gas. d. He encouraged and facilitated the building of a huge oil and natural gas depot on the coast of Cyprushttp://en.portnews.ru/news/24922/ from where the fuel will be distributed to the surrounding countries making Cyprus an important fuel route. e. While Cyprus was still a completely a virgin market for renewable energy (almost 0%), during his term the country saw a complete turnaround to the use of renewable energy sources which now make up around 9%, and fast growing, of the Country's power needs. =Cyprus Tourism= The hugely UK dependent Cyprus tourism was badly hit by the continuing 2008 crisis with the lowest being an 11% decrease in tourism revenue. His 2 main policies on tourism were the diversification from the UK tourist market and the targeting of higher value tourists. For this he sought to enter several agreements with previously non-existent tourist markets for Cyprus such as China,http://www.news.cyprus-property-buyers.com/2010/08/03/kuwait-and-china- show-interest-in-cyprus/id=005408 Israelhttp://www.neurope.eu/articles/97860.phphttp://www.thefreelibrary.com/Cyprus+and+Israel+joining+forces+on+tourism.-a0226495918 and the Arabhttp://www.cyprus.gov.cy/moi/pio/pio.nsf/All/A5E33B050388BF85C225756F0025E058?OpenDocument countries while at the same time greatly improving Cyprus’ touristic product in terms of quality. During his term the coastal town of Limassol saw the beginning of the building of a luxurious marinahttp://www.cybarco.com/link.php?id=399 whereas the marinas of Ayia Napa and Paphos were pushed to their final pre-development stages. At the same time 15 signature golf courses were licensed and/or built all over Cyprus. In Nicosia, the island's capital an agreement was achieved with the Qatari governmenthttp://en.news.maktoob.com/20090000467758/Gulf_investors_eyeing_Cyprus_tourism_projects/Article.htm for an investment in a luxurious hotel complex estimated in the hundreds of millions. As a result, even though Cyprus has still not reached its pre 2008 numbers in tourists visiting, proceeds from the tourist industry have now increased with a spectacular increase in Russian tourists by 50% in 2010.http://www.tourism-review.com/russian-tourists-visit-cyprus-more-than- ever-news2440 =Cyprus Consumers' Rights= In the general public, Antonis Paschalides is better known for his “fight” against high prices in fuel and necessities. He has often sought the permission of the European Union to place a prix-plafond (maximum sale price) on several goods and even proceeded to implement such on several occasions where price manipulation against the consumers was detected, earning him the nickname of Mr. Plafond. =Brussels= Being responsible for a Ministry covering many aspects, he participates in the EU Council of Energy Ministers, the Competetitiveness EU Council of Ministers, the EU Council of Ministers on Tourism as well as the Euro Mediterranean Forum. He has throughout been a strong supporter of abolishing or at least relaxing procedures for the issuance of visas for Russian citizens.http://www.financialmirror.com/News/14527/14550 In March 2011, after the catastrophic earthquake in Japan and the issues of nuclear danger that it brought to light, Antonis Paschalides while speaking to the EU Council of Ministers raised the issue that not only EU members should reconsider and/or impose stricter criteria on the use of nuclear power but that such measures should also be imposed on EU neighboring countries,https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFLDE72K1ZG20110321 having in mind the building by Turkeyhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-21/cyprus-to-voice-concern-over- turkish-nuclear-plan-minister-says.html of a nuclear plant in Akkuyu, an earthquake prone area just 60 km from the coast of Cyprus.

When it was formed on 14 December 1939, its component companies were spread across several Australian states, but it was later concentrated at Ingleburn, New South Wales, where it completed basic training in the early months of the war. In mid-1940, the battalion embarked for overseas, bound initially for the Middle East, but following the Fall of France it was diverted to the United Kingdom. Along with a larger contingent of Australians, it helped to bolster the island's garrison, undertaking defensive duties during a period when it was expected that the Germans might launch a cross-Channel invasion. The battalion was transferred to the Middle East in late 1940, after the threat of invasion had passed. It underwent further training in Egypt, before taking part in fighting against the Germans in Greece and on Crete in mid-1941. Having lost most of its equipment and suffering heavy casualties, the 2/1st was rebuilt in Palestine before undertaking garrison duties in Syria in 1941–1942. The battalion was withdrawn to Australia as a result of Japan's entry into the war in December 1941. During 1943, the 2/1st fought a defensive role in the New Guinea campaign. Following its withdrawal to Australia in early 1944, the battalion was re-organised on the Atherton Tablelands and reassigned to the 7th Division. It was committed to its final campaign in mid-1945, during the Borneo campaign. After the war, the battalion was disbanded in early 1946. One of its mascots, Horrie the Wog Dog, became the subject of a book by Ion Idriess. History =Formation= The 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion was formed on 14 December 1939, as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). It was raised following a reorganisation of the 6th Division's infantry battalions, which saw the removal of the machine gun platoons that had previously existed within each battalion and their centralisation in a single unit. Three other machine gun battalions were subsequently raised as part of the 2nd AIF during the war to support its four infantry divisions. Developed by the British Army, the concept within the Australian Army had its genesis during the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915, when the machine guns assigned to the infantry battalions – initially two and then, later, four – had been grouped together and co-ordinated at brigade level to help compensate for the lack of artillery support. Over the course of the war on the Western Front, the concept had evolved through the establishment of machine gun companies in 1916 to the establishment of machine gun battalions in 1918. Similar formations had also been established amongst the Australian Light Horse units serving in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. During the inter-war years, the machine gun battalions had been deemed unnecessary. When the Army was reorganised in 1921, they were not re-raised, but in 1937, when the Army looked to expand as fears of war in Europe loomed, four such units were raised within the part-time Militia by converting light horse units and motorising them. When the Second World War broke out, the decision was made to raise several machine gun battalions within the 2nd AIF, one allocated to each division. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Claude Prior, the 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion was formed with four machine gun companies, a headquarters company – consisting of an anti-aircraft platoon, a signals platoon and a transport platoon – and a battalion headquarters. Australian machine gun battalions were established with an authorised strength of around 800 to 900 personnel, and like the others, the 2/1st was a motorised infantry unit with both wheeled motor vehicles and tracked carriers. Equipped with 48 Vickers medium machine guns, the battalion's four machine gun companies – designated 'A' to 'D' and each consisting of three four-gun platoons – were initially formed separately, with 'A' Company forming at Ingleburn, in New South Wales, 'B' Company forming at Puckapunyal, in Victoria, 'C' in South Australia, and 'D' at Rutherford, in New South Wales. At the end of the month, 'B' and 'C' Companies concentrated at Rutherford, before moving to Ingleburn with 'D' Company in January 1940. An intense period of training followed, with range shoots at Liverpool, and field exercises in the Green Hills and Wallacia areas, the latter being conducted in conjunction with the infantry battalions of the 18th Brigade. This period concluded in early May 1940, when the battalion was moved by train to Darling Harbour and embarked upon the Queen Mary. =Defence of Britain= alt=A blindfolded soldier demonstrates assembling a machine gun to onlooking officers The men aboard Queen Mary were originally destined for the Middle East but a decision was made mid-voyage to divert them to the United Kingdom, as part of a larger contingent of Australians that were sent to help bolster the defences there. After making the long passage via Fremantle, Cape Town, and Freetown, the Queen Mary arrived off the coast of Gourock, Scotland, on 16 June. The evacuation at Dunkirk had been achieved just two weeks earlier and France had just fallen; Britain was now preparing for a potential cross-Channel invasion. The Australian troops from the 18th Brigade and, eventually, the 25th Brigade, along with various supporting arms, had been despatched to help bolster the island's defences. From Gourock, they entrained and moved south to Tidworth Camp on Salisbury Plain. They remained in Britain for much of the rest of the year, undertaking training, mounting guard, conducting patrols and exercises. A move to Colchester took place in October to afford the Australians a more permanent barracks for the coming winter, as they were mainly under canvas at Tidworth. The following month, as the threat of invasion seemingly passed, they received orders to move to Glasgow to embark on the transport Otranto, bound for the Middle East where they were to rejoin the rest of the 6th Division. =Middle East, Greece, and Crete= Sailing around the west coast of Africa to avoid the threat of air attack in the Mediterranean, the Otrango carried the battalion to Egypt, which was reached at the end of December, following stops at Freetown and Durban. After docking at Kantara, the battalion moved by rail over to Ikingi Maryut, west of Alexandria in the Western Desert. There they received a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Gooch, after Prior was promoted and transferred to divisional headquarters, and they began training to acclimatise to the new conditions. The rest of the 6th Division had gone into action in the Western Desert but the 2/1st, still waiting on the majority of its equipment to arrive, was not committed, its place being taken by a British machine gun battalion from the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers. The Australian battalion remained at Ikingi Maryut until late March and early April, when it was despatched, along with the rest of the 6th Division, to Greece, where a German invasion was expected. Spread across several different transport vessels, after completing the crossing – during which the battalion’s machine guns were employed for anti- aircraft defence – the 2/1st's companies were split up: 'A' Company, supported the Australian 2/4th Battalion, while two companies – 'B' and 'C' – supported the New Zealand 4th Brigade, and another – 'D' Company – was assigned to the Australian 17th Brigade. The campaign proved to be short-lived, as the Allies were quickly pushed back by the advancing Germans, and the battalion was subsequently withdrawn around the end of April and early May, having fought major actions around the Aliakmon River, Servia Pass, Lamia and Mount Olympus. During the evacuation, elements of three companies were taken aboard the transport Costa Rica, which was later attacked by German aircraft. As the vessel was sinking, the troops on board were evacuated by Royal Navy destroyers and landed on Crete, minus the majority of their equipment which was lost at sea. On Crete, the battalion's companies were once again separated; 'D' Company, the only company in possession of all of its equipment, was assigned to support the Australian 19th Brigade around Georgioupolis, while the other three companies went into camp around Suda. A single platoon from 'B' Company was later sent to reinforce 'D' Company; however, on 14 May, the remainder of the battalion – a total of 432 personnel – was evacuated from the island on the transport Lossiebank, sailing back to Egypt and subsequently missing the German invasion of Crete, which was launched a week later. A short but sharp campaign followed, which saw the machine gunners that remained – 170 personnel, including six officers – take part in fighting around Canea and Retimo before the island's garrison was finally defeated at the end of May. By the end of the fighting, the 2/1st had lost 104 men killed, wounded or captured in either Greece or on Crete; of these, two later escaped, while one died in captivity. After arriving in Egypt, the remainder of the battalion was transported to Palestine, where it was subsequently rebuilt. The 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion remained stationed around Gaza until October, when it was sent to Syria to bolster the garrison that had been established there following the defeat of Vichy French forces. At this time, the 2/1st effectively became assigned to the 7th Division, and received a new commanding officer, as Lieutenant Colonel Cyril Fidock, a World War I veteran, replaced Gooch. The battalion was subsequently stationed in Damascus and at Zaboud, remaining there until early 1942, when it was moved back to Gaza as part of the draw-down of Australian forces in the Middle East and their return to Australia in response to Japan's entry into the war. The battalion embarked upon an American troop transport, USS West Point, in mid- March 1942, completing the voyage to Port Adelaide, via Fremantle, in just 19 days. =New Guinea and Borneo= alt=A group of soldiers in tropical uniforms stand in a jungle setting Following the battalion's arrival in Adelaide, the men were billeted by locals in the city's suburbs while leave drafts were despatched throughout April. In early May, the 2/1st was reconstituted at Ingleburn, where it remained until June 1942, when the order came to move to Queensland. Moving up the coast via train, the battalion established a camp near Peachester, in the Sunshine Coast hinterland. Jungle training was undertaken there until September, when the 2/1st moved to another camp closer to the coast at Deception Bay. At the end of October, 'A' and 'B' Companies embarked in Brisbane, bound for New Guinea, to reinforce the troops fighting around Buna; en route they were diverted to Townsville, where they were unloaded. 'B' Company later re-embarked and arrived in Port Moresby in late November on the transport Both, before moving to Oro Bay, where it was deployed defensively around the US base and the mission at Eroro. 'A' Company also deployed in December, and the following month also moved to Oro Bay. The rest of the battalion remained at Deception Bay in Queensland and did not link up with the other companies until May 1943, landing in Port Moresby from the Duntroon. In the intervening period, the two deployed companies were temporarily detached to the Militia 7th Machine Gun Battalion, and 'A' Company went into action in the Pacific for the first time, fighting around Wau, before marching to Nassau Bay to support the 3rd Division during the Salamaua–Lae campaign. The battalion was withdrawn back to Australia in early 1944 for rest and reorganisation. During this period it was stationed at Tenterfield, where the soldiers experienced a bitterly cold winter, before moving to Petrie and then Kiari on the Atherton Tablelands. The battalion was reorganised to conform with the requirements of the jungle divisional establishment, and as a result its vehicles were changed to include jeeps and trailers, instead of trucks, which were considered impractical in the jungle. A change of commanding officer also took place in this time, with Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Haupt – who had previously served as battalion second-in- command before leaving to take over command of the 62nd Battalion in January 1943 – returning to take over from Fidock. A long period of training, which included courses in amphibious warfare and various jungle exercises followed, as the focus of the fighting in the Pacific shifted away from Australian forces towards the US military. Consequently, it was not until close to the end of the war that the battalion went into action again. Before this, the battalion contributed to an Australian contingent that was sent to India to lecture British Army officers on the lessons of jungle warfare. In May 1945, the battalion was transported to Morotai Island in preparation for Operation Oboe, the recapture of Borneo and the Netherlands East Indies. The 2/1st was assigned to support the 7th Division's landing on Balikpapan in July. Now largely being used as a divisional asset, the battalion provided a company to each of the division's component brigades – the 18th, 21st and 25th – while one company remained in reserve with the headquarters. Coming ashore aboard several landing craft, the two companies taking part in the initial assault – 'B' and 'D' – helped to secure the high ground overlooking the beachhead, while 'C' Company remained a floating reserve along with the 25th Brigade. The battalion's reserve company, 'A' Company, and headquarters element came ashore in a later wave to set up a secure base. During the subsequent advance inland, the battalion's main focus was progressing through what the Australians dubbed the \\"Vasey Highway\\", which ran east–west along the island's southern shore, as the Australians fought to take the oil pipeline and the airfield at Manggar, and the \\"Milford Highway\\", which ran north–south through the centre into the more mountainous hinterland. During the fighting on Borneo, the 2/1st lost 17 men killed or wounded. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the battalion's personnel were returned to Australia in small drafts, as the 2/1st undertook garrison duties in the Balikpapan area. The longer-serving men were repatriated and discharged early, while volunteers were transferred to other units that were being raised as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force that would be deployed to Japan. In November, a batch of men were transferred to the 21st Brigade for occupation duties in the Celebes as the Australian forces began preparing to hand over the territories to Dutch authorities. By December, the battalion consisted of less than fifty personnel, and at the end of the month this cadre embarked upon the transport Kings Point Victory to make the journey back to Australia. The battalion was subsequently disbanded on 26 January 1946. When they had been formed, it was intended that the machine gun battalions would provide highly mobile fire support; however, Phillip Hocking, author of The Long Carry, highlights that throughout the war the utility of the machine gun battalions was largely misunderstood by commanders, particularly after the focus of the Australian Army's operations shifted to the Pacific. Some commanders used the machine guns largely in a static defensive capacity against short and medium range targets, rather than as offensive fire support weapons that could be employed to provide long range fire support. The medium machine guns were also largely utilised in the same manner as light machine guns, such as the Bren. Other reasons identified for the concept's limited use include distrust of overhead fire by some commanders, a preference for organic fire support over attached sub-units, over-estimating the difficulty of transporting Vickers guns in the jungle, and a tendency to ignore targets that could not be seen. After their disbandment, the machine gun battalion concept was not used in the post-war Australian Army, as the function became nested within the structure of a standard infantry battalion. One of the 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion's mascots, Horrie the Wog Dog, was the subject of a book by Ion Idriess; the book was based on stories recounted by the dog's owner, Jim Moody, who served as a machine gunner in the 2/1st. Over 2,000 personnel served in the 2/1st throughout the war, and 34 members of the battalion were killed in action, died of wounds or died from accident. Decorations awarded included two Military Crosses, four Military Medals, one British Empire Medal and 16 Mentions in Despatches. Commanders The following officers served as commanding officer of the 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion: * Lieutenant Colonel Claude Esdaile Prior (1939–1940); * Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Neil Gooch (1941); * Lieutenant Colonel Cyril Henwood Fidock (1941–1944); * Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Graham Keith Haupt (1944–1945). Battle honours The 2/1st received the following battle honours for their involvement in the war: * Greece 1941, Mount Olympus, Servia Pass, Middle East 1941, Crete, South West Pacific 1945, Borneo, Balikpapan, and Milford Highway.

Eddy About King's College King's College provides accommodation for 317 men and women of the University of Queensland and Brisbane based universities. The College operates as an academic residential community of undergraduate and postgraduate members drawn from country and suburban areas throughout Australia as well as many other nations. King's has a well-equipped gymnasium (including weights room and a cardio room), swimming pool, rowing shed and pontoon, tutorial/study rooms, Old Collegians Learning Centre, barbecue facilities, half basketball court and extensive well lit car-parks. The Junior Common Room is equipped with satellite television, billiard table and table tennis table. King's College is well renowned for its Sporting and Cultural success. Having won the Old Collegians' Cup in 2018 for the 10th consecutive year has further cemented King's Colleges reputation as the 'sporting' college. =St John's College= St John's College is a co-educational residential college on the St Lucia Campus. St John's is the equal oldest college in affiliation with the University. The college was founded in 1911 – the same year The University of Queensland accepted its first students – and is currently home to approximately 300 students (colloquially known as 'Johnians' or 'Jabbers'). It has been voted as the best College ever to exist in the history of colleges. Facilities include the Stanley Law Library, the general library, the Gibson Room for biomedical studies (anatomy and histology, speech therapy and physiotherapy). In the gymnasium there is also a squash court, weights room, and sauna (sometimes), as well was pool and ping- pong tables. All undergraduate students also have access to the Junior Common Room. St John's College has a strong social atmosphere. The oldest book at the college library is a Jeremy Bentham text dating back to 1774. The College has a strong sporting tradition. It is the current ICC Weighted Sporting Shields Champions in both the men and women competitions. In 1996 it became the first College at The University of Queensland to win both the men's and women's Inter-Collegiate competitions in the same year. In 2013 St. Johns College won both the male and female overall weighted sporting trophies. Since the inception of the ICC Competition, St John's College has won the Old Collegians Cup and the ICC Cultural Cup more times than any other college. In 2018 St John's became the first college since 2000 to win all five domains: Men's and Women's sporting, Men's and Women's weighted sporting, and the ICC Cultural Cup. Music and drama are particularly strong at the College. There are seven pianos in the College and there are four specially built music practice rooms. A two manual and pedal with after market turbo pipe organ was completed in the college chapel in 1994. In 2018 a Harpsichord was added to the college chapel. The choir performs at College functions and in the intercollegiate choral festival. Students from St John's and Women's Colleges perform an annual production. Choral Scholarships are offered by the college. The College also has a Jazz Band which plays at the annual Jazz Night hosted by the student club, alongside the John's band Who Is John? and alumni bands such as The Eaglets who played in 2017. The 'slab' is a monumental section of the College, of which only a few select students know of the location. The College Anglican Chapel hosts musical events throughout the year, with an organ which has been played by organists such as Michael Faulkner. The Chapel hosts an original artwork which was commissioned for the St. John's College chapel as a celebration of its jubilee at St Lucia, Brisbane, where the university relocated. The piece, Earth Creations, is similar to Regeneratation (1972) held at the University House, Australian National University chapel. The College also hosts 9 prints of the 10 piece series The Journey, also by Leonard French, which are held in University House ANU's dining hall. In 2005, Edale wing was burned down in a fire apparently caused by unattended electrical devices left on by a student over the Easter break. The college is very multicultural with students from Japan, New Zealand, the Soviet Union and the UK. Lots of tutorials, mainly taught by current and past Johnians. About $240,000 in scholarships yearly. The highest proportion of international students after IH and Grace, with 16% of the college in 2017 being international. =St Leo's College= St Leo's College is a residential College on the St Lucia Campus of the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. ;History St Leo's was founded by Brisbane's Catholic Archbishop Sir James Duhig in 1917 and is named in honour of St Leo the Great – the first Pope Leo (440 AD to 461 AD). The book The Memory was compiled, and written by Fr Michael Head SJ, a former Rector of the College. It provides an entertaining and in depth history of the College from its inception to the mid 1990s. The College is celebrating its Centenary in 2017. The College operates a catering business. ;Sporting life The College has a sporting tradition covering a wide range of athletic pursuits. Through the Inter College Competition (ICC), College teams participate in thirteen sports including football, cricket, tennis, squash, hockey, basketball and others, while the tennis/basketball court is the scene for inter-block competition and casual challenges. The College performs well in all sports despite its relatively small size (approximately 210 students compared to about 300 at rival colleges); however, St Leo's is one of only two male-only residential colleges at the University. Traditionally strong sports include rugby, athletics, tennis, cricket and touch football, while basketball, cross country and athletics have enjoyed a resurgence during recent year. St Leo's won the ICC Sports Cup (referred to at St Leo's as \\"The FG Cup\\") in 2008 after leading King's College all year. Before 2008, St Leo's last won the Cup in 1986 – behind by a handful of ICC points when starting athletics (the last event in the ICC calendar), Simon Doyle later a world ranked 1500m runner, stormed home in the final leg of the 400m relay for Leo's to clinch the Cup. Before rugby was introduced to ICC, rugby league was the winter contact sport. In the seven seasons from 1978 to 1983, St Leo's won 54 of 56 games, drew one 2-all and lost one game (to Emmanuel) 2-nil. Unsurprisingly, in 1984 the other colleges voted to change to rugby union. Emmanuel College, the only college to ever beat Leo's at Rugby League, voted (unsuccessfully) with Leo's to retain league, earning the friendship and respect of Leo's through the 80s and 90s. Since 2001, the St Leo's College Open's Rugby Team has lost only 11 games on the back of an unbroken winning streak which stretched from 1992 till the 2001 Grand Final (the longest unbroken winning streak by any team in Queensland). Following this defeat, St Leo's would reclaim the Cup in 2002, and go on to win the Cup again in 2004, 2005 and 2006. Rugby is considered to be primary sport at St Leo's, as surmised in 2001 by Andrew \\"Chook\\" Hanrahan, the St Leos College Sports Convenor for that year, who was quoted as saying \\"Leos is Rugby\\". Despite this emphasis on rugby, St Leo's does excel in other sporting fields. The College performs well in a multitude of sports despite its relatively small size (approximately 175 students compared to about 300 at rival colleges); however, St Leo's and King's College are the only two male- only residential colleges at the University. Despite St Leo's not winning the coveted ICC Sports Cup since 1982 (another record), it continues to be one of the top-tier Colleges for sport in Queensland. In 2007, St Leo's came within 2 points of winning the ICC Cup and in July 2008, the College won the 2008 ICC Sports Cup on the back of a historic win in the 2008 Rugby Final against Kings the Francis & Kassulke Cup. A gymnasium is available for residents and the College's on-campus location provides easy access to all of the University's sporting facilities. ;Social life Students at St. Leos college participate in a wide variety of social activities, within the University of Queensland. The student club run many parties on campus, including Tropicana, St Patrick's Day Boat Cruise, Back to School, ICC Regatta After Party and Mexicana. ;Cultural life Residents are active in a full range of cultural activities, including debates, public speaking, and music. The Student Club conducts the Annual Duhig Lecture in the second semester of the University calendar. Notable speakers of have included John Howard, Prime Minister of Australia, Peter Beattie, Premier of Queensland, Malcolm Fraser, former Prime Minister of Australia, Peter Garrett, politician and former musician, Chris Masters journalist and Alan JonesHead,M (1992) St Leo's College – The Memory, p192 (radio broadcaster and one-time Wallabies coach). ;Rectors of the College * Steve Foley 2014 - * Br Vince Skelly cfc 2004–2013 * Lt Col John Long (rtd) 2001–2003 * Fr William Uren SJ AO 1998–2000 * Fr Gregory Jordan SJ 1992–1997Honorary Fellows * Fr Michael Head SJ 1991 * Fr Gerry Healy SJ 1989–1990Head,M (1992) St Leo's College – The Memory, p186 * Fr Vincent Hurley SJ 1977–1988 * Fr Brian Fleming SJ 1967–1977 ;Notable Alumni * Patrick Kinsella. * Stuart Kinsella. * Peter Whyte. * Bob Katter, Sr. * Hugh Wirth AM.

Kommunität  The Kommunität Adelshofen is an evangelical community similar to an order. It currently has 22 celibate sisters and 9 brothers. Together with salaried employees, they are responsible for the Lebenszentrum. In addition to fulfilling their manifold roles in the Lebenszentrum (teaching at the Theological Seminary Adelshofen, retreats, events, conventions and the kitchen and home economics), the sisters and brothers are preaching in various churches and Christian communities. Attached to the celibate community are a family community and a community of three women.  Theological Seminary  The Theological Seminary Adelshofen provides both theological degrees (Bachelor equivalent. Masters in cooperation with UNISA) and also conferences and seminars for laymen.  Team of the year  The Team of the year is a discipleship program for young Christians aged 18 to 24, who serve at the Lebenszentrum in form of a voluntary social year of civil service  Seminars  The Lebenszentrum offers holiday programs, seminar weeks and day seminars for children, teenagers, young adults and families. Content focus is the training of ministers and laymen in the church. On request, the Lebenszentrum organizes and implements missionary weeks in churches and special events either in form of individuals or as a team. In addition to the services in the church growth area Christian counseling is also an important part of the ministry.

Upon sculpting the idol at Sikkal, the sculptor cut his right thumb so as to ensure that he would not create anything anywhere which would surpass the beauty of the image at Sikkal. After sculpting the idol at Ethukudi, he, however, found the idol excelling the one at Sikkal in beauty and hence blinded himself as punishment. Hence while sculpting the idol of Murugan at Engan, the sculptor had to rely on the assistance of a woman as he was blind himself. By mistake, while sculpting, he cut a finger belonging to the woman and blood began to ooze. These droplets of blood fell on his eyes curing him of his blindness.

It is a non-phthalate plasticizer, being the diester of terephthalic acid and the branched-chain 2-ethylhexanol. This colorless viscous liquid used for softening PVC plastics is known for chemical similarity to general purpose phthalates such as DEHP and DINP, but without any negative regulatory pressure. It possesses very good plasticizing properties and may be used as a direct replacement for DEHP and DINP in many applications. Production One method of manufacture entails the transesterification of dimethyl terephthalate with 2-ethylhexanol: :C6H4(CO)2(OCH3)2 + 2 C8H17OH → C6H4(CO2 C8H17)2 + 2CH3OH A second method of manufacture is a direct esterification of terephthalic acid with 2-ethylhexanol: :C6H4(CO2H)2 + 2 C8H17OH → C6H4(CO2 C8H17)2 + 2H2O Use DOTP is a general purpose plasticizer that is considered safer than ortho- phthalate plasticizers due to its reduced toxicity profile. The terephthalates exhibit none of the peroxisome proliferation of liver enzymes that some ortho- phthalates have shown in several studies.OECD SIDS Initial Assessment Report for SIAM 17 (2003) It has uses in applications like extrusion, calendering, injection molding, rotational molding, dip molding, slush molding and coating. Alternative plasticizers There are several alternative plasticizers offering similar technical properties to DOTP. These alternatives include phthalates such as DINP, DOP, DPHP, DIDP as well as non-phthalates such as DINCH and citrate esters.  Possible Health Effects  According to a panel appointed by the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products (ANSM), there is very little clinical assessment data regarding the toxicity, migration from Medical Devices, and population exposure of alternative plasticizers (e.g. DOTP/DEHT) and their metabolites. The actual French government report concludes, \\"The presently available information indicates that DEHTP is not expected to pose any health or environmental risks. DEHTP is not considered as toxic for reproduction and no alert was found on potential endocrine disruption properties of the substance.\\"French RMOA - DEHTP Researchers from Korea state that: \\"DEHT, a phthalate ester stoichiometrically eqivaluent to DEHP, has been shown to have potential reproductive and developmental toxicity.\\" The NOAELs quoted are actually quite high, indicating the potential for reproductive toxicity is low.

The film is also known as Unforgotten Crime (American TV title) and Find Jimmy Valentine. The original film was cut to 53 minutes due to its B-movie billing and later for television. The film was based on the 1910 play, Alias Jimmy Valentine, by Paul Armstrong.  Plot  To boost listener ratingp , radio personality Mike Jason (Dennis O'Keefe) encourages sponsors, of his murder mystery radio show, to offer a reward to anyone who can locate safe cracker Jimmy Valentine, who is reportedly retired. The reward for the person who finds the legendary gentleman burglar is set to $10,000. There's little tough guy Mousey (George Stone), who becomes over zealous over the possibility of winning the reward. Valentine is rumored to have thrown down his hat in a picturesque small town called Fernville in Illinois. Jason and co-worker Cleo Arden (Gloria Dickson) lead the hunt, together with Mousey, and it takes them to the small and previously quiet town. The search begins in the small town's local newspaper, where Jason hopes to find some old files that can reveal Jimmy Valentine's whereabouts. Jason meets the daughter of the newspaper editor, Bonnie Forbes (Ruth Terry), who takes him to see her father, Tom Forbes (Roman Bohnen). It turns out Tom isn't willing to help out in the search for Valentine. But Bonnie has taken a romantic interest in Jason, and offers to help out. She takes the party to Tom's gardener, Pinky (Harry Shannon), who she has heard tell stories about Valentine in the past. The lead is a dead end, as Pinky claims to know nothing about Valentine of use to Jason. But when Jason and Mousey visits the Forbes' house, Mousey finds Pinky rummaging about in Tom's office, destroying old files, and there is a photo of Pinky when he was younger, where his hair color matches the color of Valentine's side kick back in the day. Mousey turns out to be the son of an infamous mobster who was framed by Valentine, and kills Pinky to revenge his father. When Jason finds out about the killing, he suspects Valentine of being the murderer. He goes about town to collect fingerprints of important persons, and stirs up the whole town, since they are all ex-convicts, having settled down in this peaceful place to live a quiet law-abiding life. The fingerprints are stored in a safe at the sheriff's office, and Jason plans to ambush Valentine and catch him red-handed when he tries to crack the safe open to get hold of the prints. Just as planned, Jason catches Tom, who turns out to be Jimmy Valentine, as he breaks the safe. In an effort to save the rest of the town from being caught, Tom wants to give Jason his prints in exchange for all the others'. Mousey enters the scene and tries to get his revenge on Tom/Jimmy. Mousey manages to kill himself, and Jason realizes that Tom/Jimmy wasn't the one who killed Pinky. Jason tells the police that Pinky was Jimmy Valentine in disguise, thus saving Tom and his daughter from ruin. Then Jason decides to stay in the small town with Bonnie.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/491289/Affairs-of-Jimmy-Valentine/  Cast  *Dennis O'Keefe as Mike Jason *Ruth Terry as Bonnie Forbes *Gloria Dickson as Cleo Arden *Roman Bohnen as Tom Forbes / Jimmy Valentine *George E.

Until 2015, it functioned primarily as a reading room for maps, music, and pre-1641 rare books; following the opening of the new Weston Library, it is now an additional reading room for all users of the Bodleian, as the Weston Library operates a reading room for special collections. It consists of the original medieval section (1487), the Arts End (1612), and the Selden End (1637). It houses collections of maps, music, Western manuscripts, and theology and arts materials. It is the main reading room for researchers of codicology, bibliography, and local history. It is also the location of the University Archives and the Conservative Party Archive. The library is on the first floor and forms an H-shape with the later parts as the uprights. The Arts End is above the Proscholium and is attached at two corners to the Old Schools Quadrangle. The medieval section is above the Divinity School and Selden End (named after John Selden a benefactor of the library) is above the Convocation House. A drawing of the medieval section with the Divinity School below in isolation is used as the emblem of the Bodleian Library. Duke Humfrey's Library was used as the Hogwarts Library in the Harry Potter films. History Duke Humfrey's Library is named after Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester, a younger son of Henry IV of England. He was a connoisseur of literature and commissioned translations of classical works from Greek into Latin. When he died in 1447, he donated his collection of 281 books to the University of Oxford. At the time, this was considered an incredibly generous donation as the university only had 20 books. All classes at that time were taught via oral lectures; books were handwritten and were only for the extremely wealthy. Oxford built Duke Humfrey's Library as a second storey to the Divinity School in order to house his collection in 1450–1480. In 1550, during the Reformation, the King's Commissioners despoiled the library of books in order to destroy the vestiges of Roman Catholicism in the country. The books were probably burnt, and in 1556 the furniture was removed by the university. Today, only three of Humfrey's original books remain in the library. The Library was refitted and restored from 1598 by Sir Thomas Bodley and in 1610–1612 the east wing (now the Arts End) was added. The west wing (now the Selden End) followed 20 years later. The books in the oldest part are accommodated in oak bookcases which are at right angles to the walls on either side with integral readers' desks. The ceiling consists of panels painted with the arms of the university.Alden's Oxford Guide, Oxford: Alden & Co., 1958; p. 18 File:Duke Humfrey's Library Interior 6, Bodleian Library, Oxford, UK - Diliff.jpg File:Duke Humfrey's Library Interior 2, Bodleian Library, Oxford, UK - Diliff.jpg File:Duke Humfrey's Library Interior 1, Bodleian Library, Oxford, UK - Diliff.jpg File:Duke Humfrey's Library Interior 3, Bodleian Library, Oxford, UK - Diliff.jpg File:Duke Humfrey's Library Interior 5, Bodleian Library, Oxford, UK - Diliff.jpg  References  Bodleian Library ","title":"Duke Humfrey's Library"},{"id":"31464170","text":"Naval Support Activity Naples (NSA Naples) is a United States Navy military complex, located adjacent to Naples International Airport in Capodichino, Naples, Italy.

The territory's capital was initially at Taleh. Since August 2014, Las Anod serves as Khatumo State's declared administrative center. In August 2016 Khatumo state commenced peace talks with Somaliland. The talks, however, caused a major disagreement between the president and vice-president of the administration, Ali Khalif Galaydh and Abdulle Agalule respectively, which eventually produced two separate administrations that both claimed to be the legitimate government. The group led by Ali Khalif reached an agreement with Somaliland, at the town of Aynabo in October 2017, which stipulated that under the condition of changing the constitution of Somaliland, the organisation would become integrated within the Somaliland government . Government Dr. Ali Khalif Galaydh The Khatumo State governmental authority is structured somewhat differently from Somalia's other autonomous regional administrations. At its establishment, it had three presidents, four councils and various ministerial positions.

Kok: Fortuyn had verkiezingen gewonnen Kok: Fortuyn had beslist gewonnen On a few occasions, Fortuyn had expressed his fear of being murdered: after being pied at the official release of his book De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars, as well as, most notably, on the talk show Jensen! on 22 March 2002. In court at his trial, Van der Graaf, an environmental and animal rights activist,Marlise Simons, \\"Dutch Suspect In Slaying Championed Animal Rights\\", The New York Times, 9 May 2002, Retrieved 20 April 2011 said he murdered Fortuyn to stop him from exploiting Muslims as \\"scapegoats\\" and targeting \\"the weak members of society\\" in seeking political power.Fortuyn killed 'to protect Muslims', The Daily Telegraph, 28 March 2003: :[van der Graaf] said his goal was to stop Mr. Fortuyn exploiting Muslims as \\"scapegoats\\" and targeting \\"the weak parts of society to score points\\" to try to gain political power.Fortuyn killer 'acted for Muslims', CNN, 27 March 2003: :Van der Graaf, 33, said during his first court appearance in Amsterdam on Thursday that Fortuyn was using \\"the weakest parts of society to score points\\" and gain political power., Dr Janet Parker 20 June 2005, New Criminologist Van der Graaf was sentenced to eighteen years in prison. The sentence was upheld after he appealed. He was liberated on parole in 2014 after completing two-thirds of his sentence and has since lived in Apeldoorn, Gelderland. Shooting Fortuyn was 54 years old when he was assassinated by Volkert van der Graaf in a car park outside a radio studio where Fortuyn had just given an interview to Ruud de Wild at 3FM. The attacker was pursued by Fortuyn's driver, Hans Smolders; he was arrested shortly afterwards while still in possession of the handgun used to assassinate Fortuyn. Moord op Pim Fortuyn YouTube, original RTL Nieuws Van der Graaf was arrested near the scene of the crime after a pursuit by witnesses. Details of the suspect were always officially reported as \\"Volkert van der G.\\" in accordance with unwritten Dutch privacy practice, but his full name was readily available on the internet. His home and work addresses were soon circulated on websites used by Fortuyn's supporters. Angry supporters gathered in several cities, so several people related to Van der Graaf went into hiding. His girlfriend and their daughter left their house on the evening of the murder. Photograph of Fortuyn taken on 4 May 2002, two days prior to his death. A photo of a poster near Fortuyn's house in Rotterdam depicting him as \\"The Dutch Haider\\" taken on 6 May 2002, the day of the assassination. The details of the murder emerged later; the accounts of the investigators and Van der Graaf were consistent. He had planned the attack using information obtained from the Internet; printouts of a map of the scene of the crime and schedules of Fortuyn's appearances were found in his car. In two boxes of cartridges found at his home, seven cartridges were missing, the exact number loaded in his gun. The attack has been described as the work of a single person, an amateur shooter who used a relatively simple plan and did not prepare a good escape route. Van der Graaf purchased his weapons illegally; a semi-automatic Star Firestar M43 pistol in a café in Ede and 9mm cartridges in The Hague. After the murder of Fortuyn, the gun was linked to a suspect in the robbery of a jeweller in Emmen through DNA material found on the weapon. On the day of the murder, he attended work in the morning, taking with him a backpack containing the gun, a pair of latex gloves, a baseball cap and a pair of dark glasses. At the end of the morning, he said he was taking the afternoon off on account of the beautiful weather. He drove towards Hilversum, knowing that Fortuyn was due to be interviewed in the radio studio of 3FM in the Media Park. During the trip he stopped several times, among other things to purchase a razor to remove his stubble, which together with the cap and glasses would disguise his appearance, while the gloves would avoid leaving fingerprints. The razor did not work. He had never visited the Media Park, relying on a map and a couple of photographs to find his way into the park on foot and to the building where Fortuyn's interview was held. Recognising Fortuyn's car in the car park, he hid in some nearby bushes, burying the gun which was in a plastic bag in a shallow trough in case he was discovered. He could hear fragments of Fortuyn's interview from a speaker on the outside of the building. He waited there for about two hours. Fortuyn emerged from the building in the company of several others. Van der Graaf walked towards Fortuyn, passed by him, then turned and opened fire. He said that he aimed for the back to avoid Fortuyn's ducking away, or that a bullet would mistakenly hit somebody else. He held the gun in both hands, with the plastic bag around it. Less than 1.5-metre from Fortuyn, he hit him in the back and head five times. He fired a sixth shot that missed. Running away, Van der Graaf was chased by Hans Smolders, Fortuyn's chauffeur. Two employees from a different building joined in. During the chase, Van der Graaf threatened them by raising the gun in his jacket pocket toward them. They ran from the grounds of the Media Park onto a public road, where Van der Graaf pointed the pistol at arm's length at Smolders. He had been reporting their position to the police by mobile phone. Reaching a petrol station, Van der Graaf gave up when police pointed their pistols at him.A Democracy In Shock, YouTube, documentary about the murder of Pim Fortuyn Response Commemorative plaque at the car park where Fortuyn was assassinated The assassination shocked many in the Netherlands and exposed cultural clashes within the country. Riots broke out on the Binnenhof on the evening following the killing. Politicians from all political parties suspended campaigning, but the elections were not postponed. Under Dutch law, it was not possible to modify the ballots, so Fortuyn became a posthumous candidate. The Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) went on to make an unprecedented debut in the House of Representatives, winning 26 seats (17% of the 150 seats in the house). This success was short-lived. In the elections the following year, Pim Fortuyn seats dropped to eight. After the 2006 elections, the party had no seats in the House of Representatives. On 15 April 2003, Volkert van der Graaf was convicted of assassinating Fortuyn and sentenced to 18 years in prison. He was released on parole in May 2014 after serving two-thirds of his sentence, the standard procedure under the Dutch penal system. Pim Fortuyn is credited with changing the Dutch political landscape and culture with his ideology, which came to be known as Fortuynism. The 2002 elections were marked by large losses for the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and the social democratic Labour Party. Both parties replaced their leaders shortly after the election. The Pim Fortuyn List and Christian Democratic Appeal made significant gains. There have been others that speculate Fortuyn's perceived martyrdom may have played in favour of the Pim Fortuyn List. The coalition cabinet which formed after the election of the Christian Democratic Appeal, Pim Fortuyn List and People's Party for Freedom and Democracy fell after three months, due to conflicts between LPF members. In the following elections, the Pim Fortuyn List returned eight seats in the House of Representatives and did not form part of the new government. However, political commentators speculated that there was still a sizable number of discontented voters who might have voted for a non-traditional party, if a viable alternative was available. In recent times, the right-wing Party for Freedom, which has a strong stance on immigration and integration, won nine seats in 2006 and 24 in 2010. In a 2004 television show election, Fortuyn was chosen as De Grootste Nederlander (\\"Greatest Dutchman of All Time\\"), followed by William the Silent, the leader of the war for independence that established the precursor to the present-day Netherlands. The validity of this election, where votes were cast online and over the phone, was questioned and dismissed as being easily influenced by Fortuyn's supporters. The murder of film director Theo van Gogh for comments critical of Islam had occurred a few days before the election and many votes for Fortuyn were attributed to this event. It later turned out that William the Silent had received more votes, many of which were not counted before Fortuyn was declared the winner, due to technical problems. Pim Fortuyn: Erfenis After Fortuyn's death, the Netherlands' right-wing politicians, including former Minister for Integration and Immigration Rita Verdonk and Geert Wilders, increased in profile and prominence.
