The World Spider Catalog regards it as a nomen dubium (dubious name). Only the male has been described and its distribution is unknown. Description Only a male preserved since 1875 has been described, initially incorrectly as Euathlus truculentus. Its body length is 55 mm; the fourth leg is longest at 67 mm. The general colour is blackish brown, with long orange-red hairs on the abdomen and legs. The femurs of the legs have bronze gold hairs. The palpal bulb has a wide embolus tapering to a point, typical of Brachypelma species (as then understood) as opposed to the long tapered embolus of Euathlus species. Taxonomy In a study published in 1992, Andrew Smith described a specimen in the British Museum of Natural History believing it to be a male of Euathlus truculentus. He used his description to support the view held at the time that the genus Brachypelma was synonymous with Euathlus. However, shortly afterwards in 1992, G√ºnter Schmidt realized that this specimen was not the same species as the type of Euathlus truculentus, but was in fact a new species of Brachypelma (as then understood), which he called B. andrewi after Andrew Smith. Smith accepted that he had been mistaken. , only this male has been described. The species was transferred to Tliltocatl, along with other species of Brachypelma, in 2020. Distribution The label on the described specimen says \\"Cuba\\", but this is considered unlikely as its place of origin, the presumption being that it was purchased in Havana, Cuba.

Nearby are two Macedonian tombs, discovered by the French archaeologist Heuzey during his Greek travels in the mid-19th century. Furthermore, the fortress-like bishop's seat Louloudies is located a few kilometers south of Pydna. History Pydna, part of the wall Pydna was first mentioned by the Greek historian Thucydides and gained importance during the Peloponnesian War.Thukydides, History of the Peloponnesian war, Book 1.137 The Athenians besieged Pydna in 432 BC.Thukydides, History of the Peloponnesian war, Book 1.61 King Archelaus I of Macedonia besieged the city by 410 BC from the land side, while the Athenian fleet took over the siege from the sea. After the city was taken, Archelaus moved the city 20 stadia far into the inland, to the present place of Kitros.Diodoros 13.14 After Archelaus's death, the inhabitants of Pydna moved back to their old seaside site. Pydna was conquered by the Athenians, but fell in 357 or 356 BC to King Philip II, the father of Alexander the Great. Philip's wife, the mother of Alexander, Olympias, was killed there after a siege by Cassander 317 BC.Diodoros 19.50 and 51 On 22 June 168 BC, the Battle of Pydna between the Roman commander Aemilius Paullus and the last Macedonian king Perseus took place. On this day the Macedonian rule ended, and in the course of the Roman victory, Macedonia became a Roman colony. Pydna issued its own coins for the first time in the late 6th century BC. Further coins were found dating from between 389 and 379 BC. Between the 6th and 7th century AD, Pydna was named Kitros, and was the most important town of Pieria until the 14th century. In the 11th and 12th centuries Kitros was the seat of a Katepanikion. In 1204 Kitros, after a siege, was taken by the Franks. They turned the bishop's church into a castle and built a tower in which their commander-in-chief resided. In the 14th century the inhabitants left the village and settled in today's Kitros, in the inland of the country. The ancient site Pydna, Fryktoria At the site of the ancient Pydna, no extensive excavations have yet been carried out yet. The visible buildings are from the Byzantine era. The remains of the ancient Polis from the Classical, Hellenistic and, possibly, pre-Greek period are lying, at least partly, under the Byzantine buildings. The entire complex measures 320 m by 130 m. Even from Mycenaean times (1400 BC) settlements were found in the hills north of the excavation site. From 1000 to about 600 BC the area was inhabited by Thracians. However, the settlement is not completely preserved because the eastern part has slipped into the sea. Thus, only the western half of the settlement is preserved, which, however, has not yet been excavated. Parts of the city wall, built in the 5th century BC, are located 500 m north of the ancient site. The exact course of the city wall is unknown. In excavation work, only parts have been discovered so far. The wall was not made of stone but of clay. It was destroyed after the city was taken by Philip II. The Christianization of Pydna began in the fourth century. At this time the first basilica was built. At the beginning of the 6th century a second basilica was built. Both basilicas were dedicated to the patron of the city, St. Alexander. The second basilica was burnt down after an attack by the Bulgarians. At the end of the 10th century a much larger basilica was built in its place. It measured 23.20 m by 16.60 m. It was decorated with frescoes and the floor was laid out with mosaic. During the Franconian period, the basilica was expanded into a fortress. A well was drilled and supplies were laid. Inside the basilica is a 22 meter deep well with a stone fountain. Next to the well there was a cistern. A subterranean corridor was dug, which was to allow the crew of the castle to escape outside. In the apse, facing the sea, there was a Fryktoria, to exchange light signals with the opposite Chalkidiki peninsula. In this way, light signals were transmitted to larger distances by means of torches, and messages could be transmitted within a short time over hundreds of kilometers. Spolias (remains and fragments of columns and other masonry work) were incorporated into the surrounding wall. The wall was built in two phases. In the 6th century, during the time of Justinian, the first construction phase took place. In the 10th century the wall was reinforced and some of the gates were walled up. The wall is about 1.40 m thick and was reinforced by rectangular towers. Some of the remains of the complex date from the 16th century, the time of the occupation of Greece by the Ottomans. West of the road, which formerly connected Pydna with Dion, are remains of the city walls and a city gate to be seen. The current course of the road is largely identical to that of the ancient road. The excavations Pydna, the well So far, the surrounding necropolis have been released. They have a considerable size. The northern necropolis contains more than 3300 graves. They date from the late Bronze Age, around 1400 BC, Until the time of Hellenisticism, at the beginning of the 3rd century BC. These are very large pits, in which numerous excavations were found. Many of them are kept in the archaeological museum in Thessaloniki. Two other necropolises are located in the west and south of Pydna. The Western was founded at the time of the classical period, in the 5th century BC, and was used until the Hellenistic period. The southern graying site dates from Hellenistic times and was cultivated until the Roman period. The size of the tombs and the valuable burial gifts indicate that more prosperous people were buried here. The southern and western necropolis are not archaeologically explored as well as the northern ones. Near the harbor a kiln for pottery and a guest house with bathroom was excavated.

It spent 145 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list over a three-year span, a record at the time.Sylvia Mendoza, The Book of Latina Women: 150 Vidas of Passion, Strength, and Success, Adams Media, 2004, p. 221.. Est√©s won a Las Primeras Award from the Mexican American Women's Foundation for being the First Latina on the New York Times Best Seller list. The book also appeared on other best seller lists, including USA Today, Publishers Weekly, and Library Journal. Est√©s had been producing popular audiotapes of her stories and research and was approached by publishers to turn them into a book. In Women Who Run with the Wolves, Est√©s analyses myths, fairy tales, folk tales and stories from different cultures to uncover the Wild Woman archetype of the feminine psyche. The book stems from these interpretations of old tales and creates this wolf-woman parallel, by incorporating her own previous studies that suggest \\"wolves and women are relational by nature.\\" The notion of the archetype is associated with the work of Carl Jung. Est√©s produces this new collection of words to describe the female psyche in Women who Run with the Wolves as it is a psychology of women in the truest sense, a knowing of the soul. American folklorist Barre Toelken criticized Est√©s' analysis of the Bluebeard tale as conflating versions from separate cultures. Toelken held this as an example of a tendency of Jung- influenced psychologists, who may overlook the complexities of folklore studies, to build complex theories around a single version of a tale that supports a theory or a proposal.

Medley was the son of Thomas Medley of Buxted PlaceHistoric England Buxted Park and his wife Annabella Dashwood, daughter of Sir Samuel Dashwood MP former Lord Mayor of London and was born on 6 August. 1720. He became a wine merchant in Portugal, where he amassed an immense property. He succeeded his brother in 1751. In 1755 he lost a part of his property as a result of the Lisbon earthquake. He subsequently returned to England and settled as a country gentleman in Sussex. He married firstly Elizabeth Jemima Palmer daughter of Sir Thomas Palmer, 4th Baronet, of Carlton on 2 June 1757 but she died soon after and was buried on 30 June 1757. He married secondly Jane Waldo, daughter of Sir Timothy Waldo of Clapham, Surrey on 8 November 1762. Early in 1761 Medley made it clear that at the approaching general election he intended to contest Seaford against the Duke of Newcastle's interest and in February he declared himself a candidate, and began a vigorous campaign, much to Newcastle's alarm. He only entered because he felt a lack of common civility showed him, and though the Duke may have backed him he did not want to come in under obligations to anybody. He then proceeded to give the Duke a good deal of trouble in Sussex. He advertised that he would contest the Sussex county seat, asked Mad Jack Fuller to help him make an opposition at Lewes and stood at Steyning. In the 1761 general election, opposition did not press to a poll at either Sussex or Lewes, at Steyning Medley received only three votes out of about 200 but he came third at Seaford. Medley took his attempt at Seaford seriously, and aimed to build up a lasting interest in the borough. He hoped to extend the franchise to all householders and after his defeat at the poll hoped for a favourable decision from the House of Commons. But his petition went against him, and a further effort in the law courts also failed. His position at Seaford remained strong, and in 1767 Thomas Pelham suggested to Newcastle that it would be wise to adopt Medley at the forthcoming general election. Newcastle did not want him at Seaford but was willing to return Medley for any other of his boroughs, ‚Äòupon an assurance of his friendship and disposition to act with me in Parliament‚Äô. Medley however declared ‚Äòthat he was an independent man, with a large fortune, and wanted nothing for himself or his family, and that he would never promise anybody how he would vote in Parliament‚Äô and made it clear that he would stand only at Seaford. Pelham persuaded Newcastle to accept Medley grudgingly on his own terms. He was elected Member of Parliament for Seaford in a contest at the 1768 general election Medley made a few speeches in the House before the dissolution of 1774. In 1774 he was returned at Seaford after a contest, apparently again on the Pelham interest. However he was defeated at Seaford in the 1780 general election . In a by-election in 1783 Medlet was returned as MP for East Grinstead on the Sackville interest and was returned in the 1784 general election. He is recorded as having made nine speeches in the parliament. He did not stand in 1790. Medley died on 1 June 1796.

He trained as a mining engineer, and soon became a senior administrator or president of various steel and mining enterprises. He headed the central committee of coal mining companies from 1907, and was first president of the Protestant Federation of France. He was active in the social Protestant movement, believing that employers had responsibility for the welfare of workers, and should not just delegate this to the state. Family √âdouard Emmanuel Gruner was born in Poitiers, Vienne, on 16 January 1849. He was from an old Protestant bourgeois family from Bern. He was the only son of Emmanuel-Louis Gruner (1809‚Äì83) and Emma Milson. His father was a civil engineer who was assistant director of the √âcole des mines and vice president of the Conseil des mines. He attended the √âcole Polytechnique from 1869. As a sub-lieutenant of artillery, he defended Paris in 1871 during the Franco- Prussian War. He entered the √âcole des Mines in November 1871, and graduated in 1873. He wrote on iron metallurgy after an internship in Styria-Carinthia. He married Mathilde Engelbach (d. 1923). They had two sons, Henri and Louis. Career Through family connections Gruner was appointed assistant director of the Compagnie Ch√¢tillon-Commentry plant at Ch√¢tillon-sur-Seine in 1874, and then in 1876 director of a factory at Neuves-Maisons. He directed the Cie Ch√¢tillon-Commentry plant at Beaucaire, Bouches-du-Rhone from 1879 to 1885. He was made a consulting engineer with De Dietrich, undertaking missions in Germany, Austrie, Russia, Spain and Algeria. At the start of 1887 there were discussions on setting up a permanent mining employers' committee, with Gruner as secretary. He spent several months in Germany that year studying how employers' organization worked there. In 1889 Gruner was named secretary general of the Comit√© central des houill√®res, a newly formed interest group of coal mining companies. Also in 1889 Gruner founded the Comit√© permanent du Congr√®s des accidents du travail at the 1889 Universal Exhibition. This group promoted regulation of accident insurance at an industry level and included Oscar Linder (1829‚Äì1917), Maurice Bellom (1865‚Äì1919), L√©on Say (1826‚Äì96) and Jules Simon (1814‚Äì96). It was one of the earliest precursors of the Mus√©e social. Gruner was an active member of the Soci√©t√© d'√©conomie sociale. He became a member of the board of directors of the Mus√©e social in November 1894 and presided over research sections at the Mus√©e on social insurance and on employer-sponsored social welfare. He was president of the Houill√®res de la Haute-Loire, the Aci√©ries de Paris et d'Outreau, the Soci√©t√© de l'industrie min√©rale and the Soci√©t√© d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale, and was an advocate at the Mus√©e social for these employer interests groups. When the Mus√©e officially opened in March 1895 Gruner was secretary-treasurer. Gruner was active in the social Protestant movement, as were other Mus√©e members such as Jules Siegfried (1837‚Äì1922), Charles Gide (1847‚Äì1932), Henri Monod (1843‚Äì1911) and Pierre-Paul Guieysse (1841‚Äì1914). As a leader of the Protestant industrial community he urged its leaders to organize themselves rather than wait for the government to impose regulations on their operations. In N√Ømes in 1891 he lectured on \\"The Responsibility for Accidents from a Christian Point of View\\", speaking as a president of the F√©d√©ration protestante and of the Soci√©t√© des missions √©vang√©liques. He argued that to letting the state organize accident insurance was to shirk a sacred social duty. Further, it would weaken the bond between employers and worker, and would thus promote socialism. He joined the International Association for Labour Legislation, a precursor of the International Labour Organization founded during the 1900 Universal Exhibition to promote unified international labour legislation. From 1905 to 1927 he was President of the Protestant Federation of France, and from 1917 to 1933 he was President of the Society of Evangelical Missions. Gruner introduced Robert Pinot (1862‚Äì1926) to the metallurgy manufacturers who were looking for a leader for their trade association, and did the same for Paul de Rousiers (1857‚Äì1934) by putting him in contact with the shipbuilders, who wanted to found a professional association. In 1905 Gruner was appointed general administrator of the Kryvyi Rih iron ore company in Russia. He was succeeded as secretary general of the Comit√© central des houill√®res in 1906 by Henri de Peyerimhoff. In 1907 he became President of the Comit√© Central des Houill√®res. At the start of World War I (1914‚Äì18) Gruner returned to the army and organized the batteries of Vincennes, directed an ammunition service then inspected in Russia (1914‚Äì16). After the war he was appointed a member of the Office for the Recovery of Invaded Regions. He was president of the Aci√©ries de Paris et d'Outreau, the Houill√®res de Haute-Loire and then of the Houill√®res de France (1931). He was president of the general commission of the √âcole des mines and of various other societies associated with the mining industry. He was appointed a Knight of the Legion of Honor in (1896), then an officer in 1901. √âdouard Gruner died in Rimoron, a commune of Breux-Jouy, Essonne, on 21 July 1933.

To this aim he sends his junior, Guy, undercover to the hostel with instructions to do anything necessary to secure the sale of the hostel within a week. Guy arrives at the hostel under the pretext of taking part in a working party with Tiffany, the hostel manager and Connie, an enthusiastic hosteller (and also the spirit of the first YHA warden). Guy tries various attempts to sabotage the hostel but through scenes showing how and why YHA developed he is drawn to understand the traditions and aims of YHA and ultimately resigns his job to support YHA.

Pupils were made familiar with the practicality of design, with the workings of machinery, and the technicalities of design as applied to various industries. In its day, it was said to be the only school of practical design for industrial manufacture in the world. Florence Elizabeth Cory organized her first class of five pupils in autumn 1881, instructing them in the principles of design and the practical application of those principles to industrial art. From that nucleus sprang the prosperous school which by 1890, included 490 students, including correspondent pupils, all of whom were striving to attain a degree of proficiency in several departments of practical designing and industrial handicraft that would enable them to become self-supporting. Among these students were representatives of every State and Territory in the United States, several Canadian cities, and the Sandwich Islands. Cory died in 1902. The school had closed by 1908. History The organization of this particular school grew out of a forceful necessity for its existence. The schools then existing taught the principles of design only, without regard to the practical application, and consequently the young women who graduated from such schools found great difficulty in obtaining employment or in disposing of their designs. In other schools of design, the teachers taught a woman to make a wall paper design; sit her down with paper, brushes and colors, she could make a beautiful design, but would not know (neither would the teachers) whether that design could be printed by machinery or not. She would not know how many colors she should use; how the colors should fall, the dimensions, or anything of the kind; the teachers do not know. A design may be well executed, faultlessly correct, and beautiful, yet worthless to the manufacturer, because it cannot be woven or printed. Machinery has its requirements and its limitations, all of which must be considered when making design, and without the practical knowledge necessary to do this an acceptable working design could not be made. The school was managed by a president and a board of directors. There were 8 instructors, all of whom were graduates of the school. The number of pupils in the elementary class of 1901 was 35, and in the advanced class, 40. The number of graduates at that time was 600. Numerous invitations were extended by manufacturers in New York and vicinity to visit their factories, and prizes amounted to several hundred dollars were offered for various designs, and a variety of valuable art specimens presented. Many designs were made and sold to manufacturers since the establishment of the school. The work done included carpets of all grades, oil cloths, linoleums, wall papers, stained glass, carved and inlaid wood panels, printed silks and silkalines, ribbons, upholstery fabrics, portieres, table linen of all kinds, calicoes, prints, awnings, lace, fan mounts, book covers, china, Christmas, Easter, and menu cards. Not only were orders filled for American manufacturers, but there were international opportunities as well: to Leeds and York, England, patterns for ingrains; to Carlsbad, Austria, designs for china; to Dundee, Scotland, patterns for table linen and towel borders; and to Japan, designs for printed and embroidered silks. Objective The chief object of this school was to give instruction in the practical application of art designs, so that when a pupil had completed the course, she would be competent to do practical work which would have both an artistic and a commercial value. Admission requirements The school is open to any young woman of good moral character upon payment of the required tuition fee. Pupils can enter the school at any time. Pupils who have not become practically familiar with drawing will be obliged to enter the elementary class. Pupils desiring to enter the advanced classes will be required to present specimens of their work‚Äîfree-hand drawing‚Äîflowers from nature or conventionalized ornamental figures, scrolls, and so forth. Tuition and commission The charges for tuition were as follows: Elementary classes, US$25 per term, or $75 for four consecutive terms; advanced classes, $30 per term, or $85 for four consecutive terms. In addition to the standard tuition, there were a number of special courses costing from ¬ß10 to $25 per term. Arrangements were also made to receive special students at a rate of $10 per month in elementary work and $15 per month in advanced work. All drawings made in the school were the property of the pupil who made them, with the exception of one sheet from each set made, which was retained as the property of the school. Pupils had the privilege of disposing of all salable designs to manufacturers while still under instruction. Many pupils were thus able to wholly or partly pay their expenses at the school. A commission of 10 per cent was required on all sales made by pupils while still under instruction in the school. Program During the first two or three years of the school's existence, lectures were given to the students by prominent artists and designers, but these were discontinued because the classes soon assumed such proportions that there was not room enough to accommodate all who wished to hear them. The full course of instruction required two yearas. The school year was divided into four terms of three months each. Sessions were held every day from 10 AM to 4 PM. The courses of instruction included elementary and advanced work in ornamental and practical designing as applied to carpets, rugs, wall paper, oilcloth, stained glass, lace, silk, calico, book covers, and so forth. * The first year classes were taught simple designing for calico, muslin, stained glass, inlaid woods, and jewelry. The elementary class also included flower painting. * In the second year, the pupils learned advanced designs for oil-cloth, silk, carpets, and other mediums. * The optional third year was passed in the practice and design room, where no regular instruction was given, but where orders were received and work done under the supervision of the principal, and well-known designers. * In addition to the regular classes, there was a department of home study and a correspondence class for those who could not conveniently attend the school. Building and fittings The rooms occupied by the school were rented. The equipment cost about US$1,000, and was provided by Cory. The school was maintained by tuition fees. The cost of maintenance was $3,000 per annum. Graduates The graduates were fitted to do practical work before leaving the school, and were not required to undergo a period of apprenticeship. In Cory's opinion, there was hardly any branch of industry in which artistic skill and taste was a component part which had not benefited by this class of schools. They have trained up a distinctively American class of designers, illustrators, and decorators whose talents have contributed to the development and success of many establishments, especially those engaged in the printing and textile industries. The effect upon those who have been under instruction is said to be beneficial in every respect. Many of the graduates are earning much higher wages than they could possibly command in other occupations where women are employed. She wrote in 1891: \\"By far the greater number of graduates are at work in their own homes, and are not employed regularly at a stated salary by any manufacturer. When their designs are finished they are sold to whichever manufactory pays the highest price.\\" References Bibliography  Defunct schools in New York City 1881 establishments in New York (state) Schools in Manhattan Industrial design Educational institutions established in 1881 Vocational schools in the United States Women's education in the United States ","title":"School of Industrial Art and Technical Design for Women"},{"id":"55386529","text":"Ruth Adler Schnee (born May 13, 1923) is an American textile designer and interior designer based in Michigan. She is one of the many founding figures of contemporary textile design in the United States. She is best known for her modern prints and abstract-patterns of organic and geometric forms. She opened the Ruth Adler-Schnee Design Studio with her spouse Edward Schnee in Detroit, which operated until 1960. The studio produced textiles and later branched off into Adler-Schnee Associates home decor, interiors and furniture. Biography Ruth Adler was born on May 13, 1923, in Frankfurt, Weimar Republic Germany, to the German-Jewish family of Marie and Joseph Adler. The family later moved to D√ºsseldorf. They fled Germany shortly after Kristallnacht in 1938 and before the start of World War II. She graduated from Cass Technical High School in 1942. In 1944 she studied under Walter Gropius at Harvard University, after receiving a fellowship to the Harvard University Graduate School of Architecture and Design. In 1945, she received a bachelor of fine arts degree from Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). Adler-Schnee interned with Raymond Loewy in New York City and she received a master of fine arts degree from Cranbrook Academy of Art in 1946, becoming the first woman to receive a graduate degree in architecture from the school. She also won a Chicago Tribune residential design competition in 1946. She studied architecture with Eliel Saarinen at Cranbrook and it was here she became interested in textile design. In 1948 she married Edward Schnee, a Yale University graduate in economics, and he helped her grow her business. Together they opened the Adler-Schnee home store in Detroit. In 1952 Adler Schnee worked with Buckminster Fuller on the Ford Rotunda by contributing drapery. Her work was also included in the General Motors Technical Center designed by Eero Saarinen and Minoru Yamasaki's World Trade Center (1973‚Äì2001) in New York. She was the subject of a 2010 documentary, The Radiant Sun: Designer Ruth Adler Schnee directed by Terri Sarris of the University of Michigan. She was awarded The Kresge Foundation's 2015 Kresge Eminent Artist for lifetime achievement in her introduction of post-war modernism to the Detroit area. Adler Schnee has a design contract with KnollTextiles, a branch of Knoll.

At the age of two in 1994 she was one of the best horses of her generation in Ireland when she won her first five races including the Silver Flash Stakes, Railway Stakes and Phoenix Stakes. Her winning run came to an end when she finished third in the Moyglare Stud Stakes, and in 1993 she failed to recapture her juvenile form. After her retirement from racing she became a broodmare and produced a few minor winners. The last of her recorded offspring was foaled in 2010. Background Eva Luna was a bay mare bred in Ireland by David Shubotham. She began her racing career in the ownership of Catherine Shubotham and was trained by Jim Bolger at Coolcullen, County Carlow. She was ridden in all of her races by her trainer's son-in-law Kevin Manning. She was probably the best horse sired by Double Schwartz, a sprinter who won the Prix de l'Abbaye, Diadem Stakes, Temple Stakes and Palace House Stakes as a five-year-old in 1986. Eva Luna's dam Guess Again was a German-bred mare who showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race and placing ten times from seventeen starts. She was a granddaughter of Fanghorn (foaled 1966) who finished third in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches. As a broodmare Fanghorn produced Double Form (sire of Double Schwartz) and was the female-line ancestor of Soldier of Fortune. Two high-class fillies named Eva Luna were foaled in 1992. The other Eva Luna was an American-bred mare who won the Park Hill Stakes and went on to produce the St Leger winner Brian Boru. The two horses may be distinguished by their national suffixes: Eva Luna (IRE) and Eva Luna (USA). Racing career 1994: two-year-old season Eva Luna made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse on 16 April in which she started at odds of 7/4 and won from ten opponents. Two weeks later, she followed up in a minor race at Naas Racecourse over the same distance, winning by three quarters of a lengths from Corso at odds of 2/5. The filly was then moved up in class and distance for the Listed Silver Flash Stakes over six furlongs at Leopardstown on 8 June in which she started second favourite behind the Dermot Weld-trained Sharp Point. After matching strides with the favourite in the first half mile before gaining the advantage and keeping on well to win by half a length. At the Curragh eighteen days later Eva Luna was stepped up again for the Group 3 Railway Stakes in which she was matched against two male opponents, namely Helmsman (runner-up in the Chesham Stakes) and Jahid. She disputed the lead in the early stages before breaking clear of her rivals in the last quarter mile and winning by three and a half lengths. The Group 1 Phoenix Stakes on 7 August appeared likely to be dominated by British-trained challengers with the Prix Robert Papin winner General Monash starting favourite ahead of Fallow (July Stakes) and Mind Games (Norfolk Stakes). Eva Luna was next in the betting on 6/1 alongside her stablemate Desert Style whilst the other five runners included Sharp Pont and the Woodcote Stakes winner Silca Blanka. The filly was up with the leaders from the start before opening up a clear advantage approaching the final furlong and won by a length and a half from Sharp Point with three and a half lengths back to Desert Style in third. On her final appearance of the season, Eva Luna was stepped up in distance and started favourite for the Moyglare Stud Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh but was beaten into third place behind the 20/1 outsider Belle Genius and the French-trained Tereshkova. At the end of the year Eva Luna was sold privately and entered the ownership of Mrs A J F O'Reilly. 1995: three-year-old season On her first run of 1995 Eva Luna started favourite for the Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes on 15 April but after reaching third place in the straight she began to struggle and came home fourth behind Khaytada. After a two-month break the filly was matched against colts and older horses in the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot. She made little impact as she started slowly and finished last of the ten runners. Breeding record Eva Luna was retired from racing to become a broodmare for her owner's stud. She produced at least twelve foals and three minor winners between 1997 and 2010: *Burma Tiger, a bay colt, (later gelded), foaled in 1997, sired by Indian Ridge. Won one race. *Feet of Fire, bay colt, 1998, by Sadler's Wells. Failed to win in seven races. *Evasif, colt (gelded), 1999, by Danehill *Robert Emmet, bay colt, 2000, by Sadler's Wells. Unraced. *National Swagger, bay filly, 2002, by Giant's Causeway. Won one race. *Sealez, bay colt, 2003, by Fasliyev. Failed to win in three races. *Strut the Stage, bay colt (gelded), 2004, by Lil's Boy. Failed to win in 24 races. *Evita Evita, bay filly, 2005, by Acclamation.

It essentially comprises the forest areas of the former free imperial city of Aachen south and west of the formerly independent municipalities of Burtscheid and , as well as north and east of the Belgian border. Apart from a few small plots, it is all in municipal ownership. In July 2003, the Forest of Aachen was awarded the environmental seal of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) on the initiative of Greenpeace, which was extended in 2008 for another five years. Geography At its widest point, Aachen Forest is about 8.2 kilometres wide, and its greatest north-south extent is about 2.5 kilometres. It lies in the transition zone between the Lower Rhine Plain and the Rhenish Massif, at an average height of 220 metres above sea level. The Brandenberg is its highest peak at 355.4 metres, closely followed by the Klausberg at 354.7 metres. Its southern and south-western part runs seamlessly into the Belgian State Forest, and its western part, in the region of Vaalserberg hills, into the Dutch State Forest. The ridge runs from west to east, forming a watershed, the streams rising south of this line flow mostly into the G√∂hl and then the Meuse. Those that rise to the north eventually all flow into the Wurm. The Aachen streams of the municipal forest, especially the Wurm, but also the Pau, Johannisbach, Beverbach and Kannegie√üerbach, were of great importance to Aachen's textile industry. With the takeover of Burtschied's municipal forest in 1897, Aachen acquired the forest cemetery (Waldfriedhof) with its Bismarck Tower, and with the addition of Forst's woodlands in 1906, it gained the Lintert cemetery and, in 1980, the private forest of the Sch√∂nforst Estate which had been bought in the 1860s from Baron Carl von Nellessen. In 1925 the city finally acquired the Von Halfern Park from Landrat Carl von Halfern, which merges into the northern edge of the municipal forest. In addition, in the 20th century, two housing estates belonging to the city of Aachen were built within the forest; a small one in the area of Pommerotter Weg and another, the quarter of Preuswald, along the southern part of L√ºtticher Stra√üe. The Aachen Forest is dominated by a telecommunications tower owned by Deutsche Telekom, built in 1984 and which is called the Mulleklenkes in the Aachen dialect. Wartime history and coffee smuggling In the forest can be found remnants of the high voltage fence, which was built at the beginning of the First World War, as a means of preventing Belgians from escaping military service by fleeing to the Netherlands. It was powered by the Aachen side, and ran from Vaals, along the German-Dutch border up to the Vierl√§ndereck, and from there to the mouth of the Schelde. Several civilians and soldiers were killed in this section. Twenty years after the First World War, the Aachen Forest was included in the framework of the Aachen-Saar program for the construction of the Westwall. There is evidence of the remaining sections of the cusp line in Kopfchen, as well remnants of World War Two bunkers at Gut Entenpfuhl and Nellessenpark. From 1945 to 1953 the forest was part of the Aachener Kaffeefront, when the high price of coffee encouraged smuggling between Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Fern lined smuggler paths can still be seen and hint at the risks that smugglers took. In total, more than 50 people, including customs officers and smugglers, died in these actions in the Aachen Forest, and more than 60 were seriously injured.

Tschappat (1874‚Äì1955) was a career officer in the United States Army and served as the 14th Chief of Ordnance for the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps.  Early life  William H. Tschappat was born in Cameron, Ohio, on August 10, 1874, the tenth of eleven children. His father moved his family to Beallsville, Ohio, where William completed his schooling. He briefly taught school in nearby Jerusalem, Ohio, while continuing his work on the family farm. Tschappat graduated fifth in his class from West Point in 1896.  Military career  Tschappat became an artillery officer and spent several years in routine assignments at Fort Slocum, Fort Hancock, and Fort Hamilton. In 1898, he became a First Lieutenant in the Ordnance Department and had an assignment at Watertown Arsenal, followed by an assignment in the Office of the Chief of Ordnance in Washington D.C. Next, he spent five years at Sandy Hook Proving Ground, followed by inspection duties at the Bethlehem Steel plant in South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. From September 1906 to May 1907, he served as Chief Ordnance Officer of the Army of Cuban Pacification and Depot Ordnance Officer in Havana. In 1907, he was assigned to Picatinny Arsenal, where he was promoted to Major in September of that year. At Picatinny Arsenal, he conducted a number of the scientific investigations in powder design and its effect upon projectiles for which he was widely recognized. In 1912, Tschappat was assigned to West Point as Professor of Ordnance and the Science of Gunnery and was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel during his tenure. During this time, he wrote his textbook, Ordnance and Gunnery, published in 1917 with several follow-on editions. This textbook was used by Cadets for a generation. One significant feature of the book was its discussion of a new method of solving the essential problems of interior ballistics. Following his teaching assignment, he was assigned administrative duties at the Office of Chief of Ordnance as a temporary Colonel in July 1918. He remained in Washington for four years. In July 1922, he became commanding officer of Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Upon completion of this command tour in May 1925, he returned to the Office of the Chief of Ordnance as Chief of the Technical Staff. Colonel Tschappat continued in this post for four years. In May 1929, he went to the Philippines as Department Ordnance Officer and Commanding Officer of the Philippine Ordnance Depot from October 1929 until June 1930. On June 10, he was promoted to Brigadier General and returned to Washington D.C. as Assistant Chief of Ordnance and the Chief of Manufacturing Service. On June 3, 1934, Tschappat was promoted to Major General and became the 14th Chief of Ordnance. During his tenure, he was primarily concerned with the scientific aspects of ordnance. His insistence upon the importance of this field laid the groundwork for much of the research and development program which culminated in the creation of the Research Division at Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1935, which expanded into the Ballistic Research Laboratory in 1938. In addition, in 1936, the M1 Garand Semiautomatic Rifle was adopted and became the standard weapon of American infantrymen in World War II. On August 31, 1938, Tschappat was retired from active duty on account of physical disability. From 1942 to 1945, he served as a member of the National Inventors Council. He died on September 22, 1955 at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington at the age of 81.

A sequel to the 2014 film The Houses October Built, its plot follows five characters suffering from trauma a year after the events of the previous film, wherein they were kidnapped and held at a haunted house attraction. The Houses October Built 2 was written by Bobby Roe and Zack Andrews, the latter of whom produced the film with Steven Schneider, whose hits include Paranormal Activity, Insidious, The Devil Inside and M. Night Shyamalan's The Visit , Split and Glass. The film was released in theaters on September 22, 2017. Plot After being rescued from their ordeal at the hands of the Blue Skeleton haunted house, five friends decide to get through their post-trauma stress by facing their fears and going on another haunted-house road trip. However, when they begin to see signs of the Blue Skeleton on their ride, they realize the nightmare they survived a year ago is far from over. Cast * Brandy Schaefer as Brandy * Zack Andrews as Zack * Bobby Roe as Bobby * Mikey Roe as Mikey * Jeff Larson as Jeff Music A soundtrack and music video was released for the movie on September 1, 2017 titled The Music October Built. It included a re-imagining of the jazz song \\"Halloween Spooks\\" by Lambert, Hendricks & Ross and \\"Blue Skeleton Man\\" by Mr. RAY. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 14% based on 7 reviews, with an average rating of 4.5/10. Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter found the film lacking saying \\"Exhibiting all of the same weaknesses as its predecessor, as well as a fatal lack of originality, this iteration will probably mean the nail in the coffin for this smugly self-regarding series, at least on the theatrical circuit.\\" John Squires of Bloody Disgusting found the sequel underwhelming, saying, \\"The organic charm of The Houses October Built is mostly absent from The Houses October Built 2, which chooses to rehash the storyline from the first film rather than expand upon any of the interesting threads that were laid out in it\\" and ultimately giving the film two out of five skulls. Rob Hunter of Film School Rejects found that both the first film and the sequel were guilty of \\"found footage issues that sink most others using the format;\\" but whereas the original \\"succeeds anyway thanks to strong chemistry between the friends and some terrifically creepy sequences,\\" the second film \\"lacks the scares to make them forgivable.\\" However, Dread Centrals Matt Boiselle gave the film four out of five stars, writing: \\"The cinematography is much more streamlined this go-round, and it's nothing but a fun time to be had, that is until the real chills come rolling in, and it's a wait worth holding out for.\\" M. L. Miller of Ain't It Cool News gave the film a positive review but cautioned, \\"I think the larger scope kind of hurts the overall story. I liked the twists and turns added, but the finale will piss off some,\\" while ultimately saying, \\"The sequel is bigger and better...The Houses October Built 2 is a fun follow up that‚Äôll please those attracted to the first film.\\" JoBlo says \\"Like any good sequel, The Houses October Built 2 takes everything we loved from the first film and expands those elements, while at the same time giving us something bigger, better, and faster this go- around.\\" Scream magazine's Jessy Williams wrote that \\"It's smart, funny and ties a tidy ribbon around the two films, crafting a neat Halloween double-bill that is filled with scary thrills, laughs and an ending that is sure to shock. \\" \\"iHorror says \\"The Houses October Built 2 is one of the most sophisticated, scary, intelligent, and fun horror movies of the year and is guaranteed to stay with you long after viewing.\\" While Maitland McDonagh of Film Journal International noted that, the film was 'Unsatisfying and more than a little dull.'.

Background  At the beginning of the conflict, the Soviet Navy possessed a decisive superiority in terms of number and capabilities of warships over the Romanian Navy, while the German Navy had yet to deploy significant assets. However only few surface operations were carried on, with no decisive naval battle fought. The Soviet Navy's efforts were quickly drained to the Siege of Odessa and the subsequent Siege of Sevastopol (1941‚Äì42), while only submarines maintained constant (albeit costly) campaigns on the first and during the second year of naval warfare.  Engagements in 1941  The first and most significant surface engagement occurred on 26 June 1941, when a Soviet task force attacked Constan»õa. The Raid on Constan»õa involved the only destroyer-size engagement on the Black Sea during the war when Romanian destroyers Marasti and Regina Maria briefly engaged the destroyers Moskva and Leningrad (both of Leningrad- class). Both Soviet units suffered light damage during the engagement, and Moskva sunk on a defensive minefield. As outcome of the action, while retaining naval superiority in Black Sea, the Soviet Navy's surface ships focused more in amphibious operations and ground support during the Siege of Odessa. Vincent O√ïHara, The German Fleet at War, 1939-1945,2014 Soviet warships, while not attempting other raids against Axis shipping in 1941, laid mines on the Western Black Sea shipping lines: A field of mines laid by minesweepers Tszcz-404 Shchit and Tszcz-408 Yakor (both of Fugas class) caused the loss between 24 and 25 October of German minelayer Theresia Wallner and the small minesweepers Drossel and Brusterort. http://www.navypedia.org/ships/germany/ger_conc_raml.htm river minelayers of WW II on navypedia.org Mines laid by Soviet destroyers Smyshlyonyy and Bodryy sank the Hungarian merchant Ungvar (961 GRT) on 9 November: when the Romanian motor torpedo boat Viforul and Vijelia sailed to attempt rescuing the ship, both were lost either to mines or the merchant's explosion. Donald A Bertke,Don Kindell,Gordon Smith, World War II Sea War, Vol 4: Germany Sends Russia to the Allies, 2012p390 Toward the end of the year, other Soviet-laid mines caused the loss of the Romanian merchant Cavarna (3495 GRT) and the German merchant Cordelia (1357 GRT) between 1 and 2 December 1941. The mines responsible for these losses were either the ones of destroyers Smyshlyonyy and Bodryy, or the ones laid by gunboats Krasnaya Gruziya and Krasnyy Adzharistan. Donald A Bertke, Gordon Smith, Don Kindell, World War II Sea War, Vol 5: Air Raid Pearl Harbor. This Is Not a Drill, 2013, page 63  Engagements in Late 1942  In late 1942 Soviet Navy surface ships attempted once again to raid Romanian waters for Axis shipping, this time without further minelaying operations. Three main raids were attempted but were hampered by effective Axis intercept stations that alerted most merchants in the area to the Soviet naval presence. * On 1 December 1942, the Soviet cruiser Voroshilov bombarded Snake Island together with the destroyers Soobrazitelny and Kharkov. The cruiser fired forty-six 180 mm and fifty-seven 100 mm shells, which struck the radio station, barracks and lighthouse on the island, but failed to inflict significant losses. Her shelling was cut short by Romanian mines, which significantly damaged her. However, she managed to return to Poti for repairs under her own power.Jipa Rotaru, Ioan Damaschin, Glorie »ôi dramƒÉ: Marina RegalƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, 1940‚Äì1945, Ion Cristoiu Publishing, 2000, pp. 93‚Äì94 (in Romanian)Timothy C.

In the morning of 13 December, the convoy was attacked by the destroyer Soobrazitelny and four Fugas-class minesweepers. The exchange of fire lasted for two hours, until Smeul launched a smokescreen which enabled the four R-boats to simulate a torpedo attack, causing the Soviet warships to retreat. None of the Axis or Soviet warships were damaged.Jipa Rotaru, Ioan Damaschin, Glorie »ôi dramƒÉ: Marina RegalƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, 1940‚Äì1945, Ion Cristoiu Publishing, 2000, p. 94 (in Romanian)Timothy C.

Axis forces were able to intercept Soviet naval radio signals which alerted them to the Red Fleet's plans and allowed them to avoid any permanent losses. The German merchant ship Saone became temporarily grounded while she rushed to harbor, but was not found by the raiding force and was later recovered.  Outcome  Overall, Soviet surface actions failed to inflict significant damages to the Axis shipping lines. While minelaying operations inflicted some losses in 1941, they were not repeated the following year and three subsequent raids failed to intercept Axis shipping. Aside from submarine operations, in 1943 the Soviet Navy switched focus entirely to the Kerch‚ÄìEltigen Operation and other ground support missions.

The company was from 1929 based in Vanl√∏se. It was acquired by To-R in 1952. The company established a production of clocks during World War II. The clocks were after 1952 sold under the name Clementa by a separate company. History Clemen J√∏rgensen (1893‚Äì1992), a clock-maker from Silkeborg, moved to Copenhagen in 1921. In 1924, he established a production of horn loudspeakers in his own apartment. In 1925, he moved the activities to a backroom on Hostrupsvej. They were sold under the name Element through the wholesaler J. Axel Christensen & Co. at N√∏rrevoldgade 52. Later in 1925, J√∏rgensen established a production line in a building in the courtyard at Borgergade 108. His brother, Magnus J√∏rgensen, a furniture-maker, became a partner in the company. Their loudspeakers were sold under the brand D.N.D. (short for , English: The New Danish). The Telavox factory in 1936 J√∏rgensen was an acquaintance of the inventor Peter L. Jensen who had established Magnavox in 1927. Jensen proposed J√∏rgensen to use the name Telavox. In 1929, J√∏rgensen bought a factory at Apollovej 31 in Vanl√∏se. The company had now also established a production of radios. The company was known for its high quality of craftsmanship and was also producing cabinets for other radio manufacturers, including Philips (in 1930). Magnus J√∏rgensen died in 1932. Clemen and Magnus J√∏rgensen's younger brother, who was also a furniture-maker and had joined the company in 1927, then took over the position as head of the cabinet division. The factory was expanded in 1937. It had 250 employees in 1943. J√∏rgensen designed and constructed a wind turbine which he placed on the factory roof. The wind turbine, which had a 10 kW maximum output, produced electricity for many years. It was his hope that manufacture of wind turbines would be a future source of income for the company but the prototype was never commercialized. On 1 April 1952, it was sold to To-R, another Danish radio and television manufacturer. Clocks During World War II, radio valves were unavailable in Denmark and telavox therefore established a production of clocks on their factory in Vanl√∏se. The first clocks were manufactured in 1942. J√∏rgensen used a bimetallic balance on his Telavox clock design to avoid temperature variations and hence make the clockworks more accurate than other clocks on the market at the time. From 1944 to 1952, Telavox manufactured a total of 150,000 clocks with ten different case designs and four types of movement. When J√∏rgensen sold the company in 1952, clock production was split off from radio manufacturing under the name Clementa.

Specifically, these techniques primarily break the optical diffraction limit of the photoacoustic imaging system. It can be achieved in a variety of mechanisms, such as blind structured illumination, multi-speckle illumination, or photo-imprint photoacoustic microscopy in Figure 1.  Photoacoustic (PA) imaging  This particular biomedical imaging modality is a combination of optical imaging, and ultrasound imaging. In other words, a photoacoustic (PA) image can be viewed as an ultrasound image in which its contrast depends on the optical properties, such as optical resolution of biomolecules like hemoglobin, water, melanin, lipids, and collagen. The advantages of photoacoustic imaging are that it gives higher specificity than conventional ultrasound imaging and greater penetration depth than conventional ballistic optical imaging modalities. Photoacoustic imaging works by irradiating the target with a short-pulsed laser, or alternatively an intensity-modulated laser. The target absorbs this optical energy, which is converted into heat; in most cases the amount of heat is a fraction of approximately (1 - fluorescence quantum yield). Heat is further converted into a pressure rise via thermoelastic expansion, and the pressure rise behaves as an ultrasonic wave, the wave of which is called a ‚Äúphotoacoustic wave‚Äù that propagates throughout the surroundings of the target. The photoacoustic wave is then detected by ultrasonic transducers, and these signals are used by an image processor and computer to reconstruct an image of the target.  Super-resolution imaging and photoacoustics  Recently, several techniques have broken the diffraction limit of light, enabling the observation of individual cellular structures, sub-cellular structures, and processes at the nanometer level, structures that were previously unresolvable by conventional microscopes due to resolutions finer than the optical diffraction limit (~250 nm in lateral direction at high optical NA). However, as super-resolution optical imaging generally relies on fluorophores, only fluorescence imaging by usage of multiple lasers or chemical manipulation of fluorophores is possible. This results in a set of complex configurations for the imaging system and limited use for fluorescent targets. Photoacoustic tomography, is able to complement these super resolution techniques and achieve much greater field of depth and remove the need for fluorescent molecules.  Super resolution techniques  Photoacoustics relies on optical excitation of targets and detection of acoustic emission. Since the frequencies of electromagnetic waves (light) are significantly higher than that of acoustic waves, the optical excitation generally sets the absolute resolution. This absolute resolution is well known in optics and is called the diffraction limit of light. This diffraction limit shown below represents the minimum distance that can be resolved between two objects (or similarly the minimum separation distance between two objects excitated by a laser). d = lambda/2NA Super resolution techniques break this limit by generally using nonlinear techniques such as saturations, switchable quenching, or multiphoton absorption. Photoacoustics directly benefits from these techniques as the excitation can be held to a tighter spot and hence detect acoustic waves to a tighter spot, ultimately improving resolution.  Optical saturation and nonlinear thermal expansion  Photoacoustics primarily relies on the pressure wave generated by the absorbing material. At higher excitation energy levels, the excitation becomes greatly nonlinear, leading to different effects on the pressure wave generated. The two equations below are the resulting pressure waves from either nonlinear thermal expansion or optical saturation. (1) p(overrightarrow{r}-overrightarrow{r_0},z-z_0) = frac{1}{kappa} {beta_1T(overrightarrow{r}-overrightarrow{r_0},z-z_0) + frac{1}{2} beta_2left [T(overrightarrow{r}-overrightarrow{r_0},z-z_0) right ]^2} (2) p_0(overrightarrow{r_0},z_0,E_p) = sum_{n=1}^infty c_n(overrightarrow{r_0},z_0) cdot (E_p)^2 Equation (1) above is the pressure wave generated by the non-linear thermal expansion. Equation (2) is the resulting wave generated from optical saturation. The key idea is that the sample is pumped with high levels of energy such that all of its electrons are saturated to the excitated state. In this saturated state, the additional energy will be utilized in different ways such as nonlinear thermal expansion. From these pressure waves, images corresponding to the absorption of different molecules can be reconstructed. In Figure 2a and 2b, two 100 nm gold nanoparticles are resolved with super resolution enhanced photoacoustics and verified by atomic force microscopy, a different modality that can break the diffraction limit resolution since it does not rely on light. Figure 2: Comparison of different imaging modalities on two 100 nm gold nanoparticle. This can be extended to whole images with scanning techniques and Figure 3 shows the dramatic difference with the added super resolution technique. With super resolution, the smaller details of the melanoma cell pictured is visible. Figure 3: Before and after super resolution techniques applied to photoacoustic phase microscopy.  Photoswitchable probes  Reversibly photoswitchable proteins can switch back and forth between two optically separated states, making them useful for high-contrast and high resolution PA imaging. Yao et al. demonstrated differential imaging of the reversibly switchable phytochrome BphP1 in in vivo experiments (terming the technology RS-PAM). The two states of the BphP1 molecule are the Pfr and Pf states, referred to as the ON and OFF states, respectively. When stable, BphP1is at the On state. Upon 780 nm laser pulse train illumination, BphP1 molecules in the on state gradually switch to the off state. As a result, the amplitude of the generated PA signals decrease. The decay rate is proportional to the local excitation intensity. Thus, PA signal in the center of the excitation beam will decay faster compared to the surrounding. Using the difference image between the two states gives a high contrast image of the molecules (Figure 4), and sub-diffraction limited lateral and axial resolutions will be achieved. In the lateral direction, the decay dependence on the local excitation intensity results in a smaller FWHM of the decay PSF. The higher the order of the nonlinear decay, the higher the resolution enhancement will be. The effective lateral PSF for this imaging technique was shown to be (0.51/sqrt{1+bm}) lambda_0/NA where b is the power dependence of the switching-off rate on the excitation intensity (for BphP1, b=1), and m is the order of the polynomial fitting. This technique achieves finer resolutions with a factor of sqrt{1+bm} compared to conventional PAM. In the axial direction, the nonlinear optical effect will determine the resolution (since only in focus molecules contribute in the signal decay), thus, making it independent from the acoustic detection. This allows this technology to have optical sectioning capability. For point targets, the achievable axial resolution is 1.8sqrt{2^{1/1+bm}-1} times(lambda_0/NA^2) whereas for large targets, it is 1.8sqrt{2^{1/bm}-1} times(lambda_0/NA^2) Figure 4: PA images of BphP1 expressing U87 cells and HbO2 in scattering media. The differential image effectively removes the background signal, increasing the contrast of the cell area. As a demonstration (figure 5) this technique showed much finer lateral and axial resolutions compared to conventional PAM. The lateral and axial resolutions were quantified to be ‚àº141 nm and ~400 nm, respectively, which were about 2 and 75 times better than that of conventional PAM. Figure 5: Comparison of lateral and axial resolution of conventional PAM and RS-PAM in imaging.  Two-photon photoacoustic mechanism  Non-radiative two- photon absorption can be utilized to achieve high 3D resolution in in vivo experiments. In conventional PAM temporal or spatial filtering is needed to eliminate background signal and achieve high axial resolution. However, in 2PAM, only the area within the focal spot generates nonlinear photoacoustic signals (figure 6). Based on the two-photon absorption PSF, the lateral (Delta x_{2PAM}) and axial resolution (Delta z_{2PAM}) of the 2PAM system are determined to be... (3) Delta x_{2PAM} = begin{cases} frac{0.64lambda_{ex}}{sqrt{2}NA} , & text{NA} leq text{0.7}  frac{0.65lambda_{ex}}{sqrt{2}{NA}^{0.91}} , & text{NA} > text{0.7} end{cases} (4) Delta z_{2PAM} = frac{1.064lambda_{ex}}{sqrt{2}}left [frac{1}{n - sqrt{n^2 - NA^2}} right ] where Œªex is the excitation wavelength, and n is the medium refractive index. The important property of the axial resolution is its independence from the frequency of the photoacoustic waves. Therefore, lower frequency ultrasound waves can be used for deeper detection. Figure 6: Comparison between PAM and 2PAM. Although two- photon excitation can potentially give a smaller PSF, but because one photon absorption is achieved easily by molecules, there will be a prominent 1PA signal from the area around the focal spot, making the detection of 2PA signals a hard problem. The 2PA signal can be separated from the 1PA background signal using a lock-in detection system, as demonstrated by Lee et al... After amplitude modulation of the input laser train (modulation frequency = f), nonlinear absorption of molecules within the focal excitation spot will generate high harmonics of the modulation frequency (2f, 3f‚Ä¶.). Photoacoustic signals from the two-photon absorption can be extracted by locking at the second harmonic of the modulation frequency (2f). In this paper, lateral and axial resolutions of 0.51 Œºm and 2.41 Œºm in in vivo experiments were achieved, demonstrating the sub-femtoliter resolution (0.49 Œºm3 with NA=0.8) of the 2PAM imaging system. 1PA images had only 0.71 Œºm lateral resolution. The two-photon nature of the signals contribute to the 1.4 factor improvement of the 2PAM to 1PAM lateral resolution Figure 7: Comparison between PAM and 2PAM images of melanin distribution.  Structured illumination  Structured illumination is an imaging technique that when applied to microscopy, can double the spatial resolution of that of conventional fluorescence microscopy using the moir√© interference pattern, the coarse pattern that is produced when two finer patterns are overlapped and provides easier viewing than either original pattern. Structured illumination occurs in the interaction of a three-dimensional modulated illumination pattern and high-frequency variations in the sample fluorescence caused by small structures, the interaction of which produces a lower-frequency Moir√© pattern that contains non-resolvable structures present in the observed image. When these Moir√© patterns are imaged in different positions and subsequently computationally post-processed, then the lower-diffraction sample information can be algorithmically decoded and reconstructed. When information above and below the focal plane are added, then spatial resolution will be enhanced and normally non-resolvable sample structures are more easily resolvable. One advantage of structured illumination is its ability to be used with any conventional fluorophores, and one disadvantage is its image acquisition speed that requires complex imaging and therefore compromises temporal resolution needed for live cell imaging = Blind illumination = Blind structured illumination photoacoustic microscopy (BSIPAM) was employed as a feedback-free imaging method that uses random optical speckle patterns as a structured illumination for enhancing the spatial resolution of PA imaging within scattering media. Unlike structured illumination microscopy, where the spatial resolution enhancement was limited only to 2, BSIPAM has a higher spatial resolution. BSIPAM operates by the key principle: to recover absorber distribution œÅ at spatial resolution close to speckle size.  Principle  If there are M different speckle patterns, ùöΩ1,...,ùöΩM, and the assumption holds that speckle patterns and absorber distribution are represented by discrete vectors ùöΩm, rho in Re^N, an expression for measured PA data can be written. y_m = h * left [ Phi_m cdot rho right ] + epsilon_m where m = 1,...,M. h in Re^N is the PSF of the photoacoustic imaging system in discrete form, left [ a cdot b right ] (x_i) = a(x_i)b(x_i) is the pointwise multiplication, left [ a * b right ] (x_i) = sum_{j=1}^N a(x_i- x_j)b(x_j) is the discrete deconvolution step, and Œµm is the noise in the data. The goal was to recover absorber distribution and speckle patterns ùöΩm from the data from the expression above. As the intensity distributions and speckle patterns are unknown, MN equations with (M+1)N unknown scalar parameters are derived from the expression. Sound sources p_m = Phi_m cdot rho present in the expression are uniquely determined by deconvolution equations, but deconvolution is ill-conditioned, so authors use block-sparsity to give high-resolution reconstructions. It is common knowledge that using sparsity gives a super-resolution signal recovery, as sparse-recovery algorithms assume that the signal is a superposition of a few elements from a large set of high-frequency and low-frequency information. But this approach misses the main point of the reconstruction problem: that all products come from same density distribution œÅ. A joint sparsity term left Vert p right Vert_{2,1} = sum_{i=1}^N sqrt{sum_{m=1}^M left vert p_m(x_i) right vert^2} is implemented as a regularization term on p = (p1,...,pM) and a reconstruction algorithm, block-FISTA, is developed to realize this joint- sparsity approach for solving the expression.  Experimental setup  In the experimental setup of BSIPAM (Figure 4), the sample is placed in a water-filled tank with transparent walls, and light from a pulsed Nd:YAG laser (Œª = 532 nm) goes through a glass diffuser and focused on the sample with a lens with focal length f = 50mm. The speckle size at the focal plane of the lens is 1.22Œªf/d, where Œª is the wavelength of the light source and d is the aperture diameter. Ultrasonic signals were recorded by an ultrasonic transducer that is connected to an ultrasonic receiver and sampled with a 12-bit digital oscilloscope. Then, photoacoustic signals were collected with a step size of 10 Œºm over a scan length of 1.0 mm, the time traces were processed by the Fourier transform, and the magnitude was produced between 15 and 85 MHz to determine the net photoacoustic response at each spatial location. Figure 4: Schematic of the experimental setup of BSIPAM. Figure courtesy of.  Research  BSIPAM was tested with a simple one- dimensional sample where the absorber distribution œÅ was a series of 8 lines of 10 Œºm thickness, the distance between the lines varied from 40 and 150 Œºm, and the absorbers were illuminated with the speckle pattern with a speckle size of 25 Œºm (Figure 5). The photoacoustic response distribution was determined by the product of the speckle intensity and absorber distribution. Next, it was assumed the absorber was present in the focal plane of an ultrasonic transducer with a Gaussian point spread function (PSF) h with a FWHM of 100 Œºm. The photoacoustic response was determined by the convolution of the source distribution with the transducer PSF, and the experiment was repeated M = 100 more times with a new random speckle pattern each time. Figure 5: The results from running BSIPAM with the simple 1D sample.

Figure 6: (a) Results from the photoacoustic PA response measured from line scans over the absorber distribution subjected to six different random illumination patterns. (b) Object and reconstructions of object using 100 speckle patterns where responses are shown. Figure courtesy of. Based on Figure 6, structured illumination via random speckle illumination influence line scan response‚Äîthis variation needed for super-resolution imaging. Also, on Figure 6(b), a set of different techniques were applied to compare their photoacoustic responses in reconstructing the absorber distribution. The mean response was obtained by averaging all line scans, the variance response was obtained by applying the square root of the signal variance at each spatial position, the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution (RLD) response was obtained by performing the deconvolution of the mean response with the given Gaussian PSF, and the BSIPAM response was obtained through the block-VISTA algorithm. In comparison to the other responses, the BSIPAM response shows that the smallest feature spacing (40 Œºm) is resolved, giving a resolution advantage over other approaches. In another example, BSIPAM was tested with a two-dimensional sample, a star with an absorber of multiple lines. The sample has size 256 Œºm2, the distance between the lines is 17 Œºm, and the PSF is a two-dimensional Gaussian kernel with a FWHM of 35 Œºm. The BSIPAM experiment is repeated M = 200 times, each with random speckle patterns, and the speckles each have a size of 9 Œºm. Figure 7 displays the results. When BSIPAM is applied, the resolution is improved by a factor of 2.4. Figure 7: The results with a 2D sample and 200 random speckle patterns. (a) The object. The reconstructed object using...

Figure courtesy of. = Speckled Illumination = Multiple optical speckle illumination was used as a source of fluctuations to produce super-resolution PA imaging. Specifically, a second-order analysis of optical speckle-induced PA fluctuations to develop PA images beyond the acoustic diffraction limit  Principle  Multiple optical speckle illumination makes use of the principle of super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI). SOFI is the principle that a higher-order statistical analysis of temporal fluctuations caused by fluorescence blinking helps resolve uncorrelated fluorophores in the same diffraction spot. In principle, it is assumed that the reconstructed PA quantity, A(r), can be written in the form of the equation: A(r) = [mu_a(r) times I(r)] * h(r), where Œºa is the optical absorption distribution, I is the optical intensity pattern, and h is the point spread function (PSF). If the region of interest is illuminated by multiple speckle patterns Ik(r) with the ensemble mean left langle I(r) right rangle = I_0, then the expression for the mean PA image can be calculated by averaging the PA images. These PA images can be produced from multiple realizations Ik(r) of the speckle illumination, and therefore the expression is as follows: left langle A right rangle (r) = I_0 times [mu_a(r) * h(r)]. This shows that the resolution is determined by the spatial frequency in h(r). If it is assumed that the speckle size is much smaller than that in h(r), then the variance image is provided by this expression: sigma^2[A](r) varpropto mu_a^2(r) * h^2(r). The squared PSF has a higher frequency content than the PSF itself, and therefore the variance image has a higher resolution than the mean image.  Experimental setup  As shown in Figure 8, a 5 ns pulsed laser beam was focused on a ground glass rotating diffuser, and the light was scattered onto two-dimensional absorbing samples that were embedded in an agarose gel block. The speckle grain size was recorded to be approximately 30 Œºm due to the sample distance from the diffuser, 5 cm. The absorbing samples were then placed onto the ultrasound transducer array that was connected to an ultrasound scanner, and polyethylene beads of 50-100 Œºm in diameter were assigned in place of absorbing samples with isotropic emitters. Finally, the diffuser was rotated to produce a series of PA images for 100 different speckle patterns, and the mean and variance images were produced. Figure 8: Schematic of the experimental setup of multiple optical speckle illumination. Figure courtesy of.  Research  When multiple optical speckle illumination was tested on a sample of a set of randomly distributed 100 Œºm diameter absorbing beads, the variance image clearly displayed the contributions of each bead, the images displayed approximations of the point spread function (PSF) and its square, and the resolution was enhanced by a factor of 1.4 for the variance image as opposed to the mean image. The variance image appears as the convolution of the sample with the squared PSF, and the results in the below figure (Figure 9) clearly demonstrate the ability of SOFI to produce super-resolution PA imaging with multiple-speckle illumination. Figure 9: (a) A photograph of the sample of 100 Œºm diameter beads, (b) The mean PA image of the sample over 100 speckle realizations, (c) The variance image of the sample. Insets in both (b) and (c) are images of a single bead. Figure courtesy of.  Future directions  Super-resolution PA imaging faces potential directions. The algorithm of BSIPAM has the potential of reconstructing structures from signals using other modalities such as photothermal imaging or optical coherence tomography. Multiple speckle illumination can be applied to the fluctuation of the absorption caused by blinking or switchable contrast agents, instead of simply tissue-induced temporal decorrelation of speckle patterns  See also  * Super-resolution imaging * Photoacoustic imaging * Super-resolution microscopy * Diffraction- limited system  References  Imaging ","title":"Super-resolution photoacoustic imaging"},{"id":"55387047","text":"Bouber is a surname.

It is located on the left bank of the Danube across the village of Krƒçedin, in the municipality of Inƒëija, Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. The uninhabited island is part of the . It is one of the largest remaining natural pastures in the Podunavlje, known for the traditional stock breeding, with only basic human interference.  Location  The island stretches approximately between the Danube's , on the river's left bank. Across the Danube, a bit further from the bank, is the village of Krƒçedin, after which the island was named. Though it is geographically in the Baƒçka region, administratively it belongs to the municipality of Inƒëija (so as the village), in the Syrmia region. Right north of the island, closer than the village of Krƒçedin, is the village of Gardinovci, in the municipality of Titel. Just west of the island the Be≈°ka Bridge crosses the Danube while to the northeast are the village of Kovilj and the Kovilj Monastery.  Geography  The island is roughly shaped as a rounded triangle, with the top on the north. It is located in the valley of the Danube and on the east extends into the micro-region of Ko≈æjak, within the Marsh of Kovilj (Koviljski Rit). It was created when the Danube shifted its course to the south and cut through its own meander curving around the northern slope of the Ko≈°evac Hill on the Syrmian side, northeast of the village of Kreƒçedin. It appears as if being embedded into the Baƒçka mainland and the narrow arm of the Danube which separates it from the land is called Dunavac (\\"Little Danube\\") on the west and Arm of Gardinovac on the east side. This arm then branches into numerous smaller arms and ponds. Still, during the normal water level, majority of the island remains dry, while most of it got flooded during the rainy season and high water levels. The highest point on the island is . The island is long, wide and covers an area of . Across the river, to the west, are two archaeological sites, and .  Plant life  The island is rich in fresh water and grass. It is also partially forested, mostly by the willows, some of which originate from c. 1810s.  Wildlife  The arm which separates the island from the mainland is a rich, natural spawning area for common carp, northern pike, Prussian carp and sterlet. The Island of Krƒçedin is one of the largest spawning areas of common carp in Europe. Birds inhabiting the island include storks, herons, mallards and cormorants. In total, there are 172 bird species on the island, of which 103 are declared rare. Among them are the white tailed eagle, great white heron, black stork, Eurasian eagle-owl and saker falcon. During the hot summers and the low water level, the Dunavac partially dries up, so the island can be visited by bicycle. The natural bridge is also, albeit rarely, used by wild animals to reach the island, like deer, jackals or wild boars.  Husbandry  The villagers from Krƒçedin were the first who began transporting their livestock to the island, by the ferries, in the 19th century. They were later followed by the inhabitants of other neighboring villages: Kovilj, ≈†ajka≈°, Gardinovci, ƒåortanovci, Stari Slankamen. The animals are transported in the early spring and left until the late autumn to live completely freely as the island is uninhabited, without natural predators and with preserved natural habitat since it is undisturbed by the urban development. The livestock includes horses, sheep, cattle, pigs and donkeys. The well fed animals and their young born on the island are returned to the mainland, into the stables only when it gets too cold or rainy, though horses and pigs are sometimes left on the island even during the winter. Some rare breeds, like the mangalica pigs, local breed of the shepherd dog pulin or the Podolian cattle are also kept on the island, so as a lots of poultry, like hens, turkeys and peacocks. There were 80 Podolians in 2017, out of 400 in the entire Serbia. As of 2017 the island numbered 1,000 cattle and pigs, 200 horses and over 100 Balkan donkeys. Donkeys are becoming more and more popular, due to the high prices of their milk. In the 1990s however, over 6,000 animals were kept on the island.  Tourism  The island is part of a much larger Special Natural Reserve \\"Koviljsko-Petrovaradinski Rit\\", a wetland along the Danube. Municipality organizes photo safari-like tours to the island from May to September. They are conceived as one-day excursions with the small groups of visitors.

Political career S√ºli was involved in the Fidesz-ally Smallholders' Civil Association (KPE) and led its Madocsa branch. Despite his replacement as CEO of the Paks Nuclear Power Plant in September 2010, S√ºli is considered as a right-wing, conservative-minded provincialist, who had extensive ties with the local branch of the Fidesz. The left-wing N√©pszabads√°g noted the dismissal of S√ºli as CEO was because of \\"some energetic lobby interests\\", despite that S√ºli, before the nomination, asked for the opinion of Fidesz leader Viktor Orb√°n, whose victory was unquestionable in the next parliamentary election in 2010. Nevertheless, Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n still maintained his trust in favour of S√ºli. After J√°nos Hajd√∫, the mayor of Paks since 2002 announced in May 2014 that does not want to run in the upcoming municipality local elections, the local branch of the Fidesz and the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) intended to nominate S√ºli as their candidate. However the national leadership of the governing party announced in the next month that they chose Gy√∂rgy Kozmann, a former Olympic sprint canoeist as their candidate. Following that S√ºli established the Civic Unity for Paks and became its candidate for the mayoral position. Several members of the local Fidesz and KDNP branches joined to his initiative. The Paks sections of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and the Democratic Coalition (DK) also expressed their support to S√ºli, who was elected as mayor, officially as candidate of the People's Party (NP), with 77.8 percent of the vote, over Fidesz‚ÄìKDNP-candidate Gy√∂rgy Kozmann. Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n announced at a parliamentary plenary session on 10 April 2017 that he had appointed J√°nos S√ºli as minister without portfolio in his third cabinet, responsible for the planning, construction and commissioning of the two new blocks at Paks Nuclear Power Plant. S√ºli accepted a nomination and said he wants to keep Attila Asz√≥di, the Government Commissioner for the project in his staff. According to the opposition N√©pszava, S√ºli, who served as CEO during the Socialist Bajnai Cabinet, was a good choice for Orb√°n to discredit the Socialist Party's communication attacks against the controversial investment. S√ºli took the ministerial oath on 2 May, while also resigned as mayor of Paks. S√ºli told during his inaugural press conference on 8 May that the nuclear power plant will be complete for the deadline of 2026. He said his main task has to prepare the Hungarian companies to be a good supplier to the Russian constructor. S√ºli hoped the construction will provide work for 8-10 thousands of people in the coming years. In June 2017, S√ºli dismissed and replaced the majority of the Paks2 project company's management. J√°nos S√ºli was appointed as individual MP candidate of the governing coalition Fidesz‚ÄìKDNP for Tolna County Constituency III (Paks) during the 2018 parliamentary election, replacing incumbent Fidesz parliamentarian Ferenc Hirt. He obtained the mandate and joined the KDNP parliamentary group. He retained his position of minister without portfolio in the Fourth Orb√°n Government too.

History Don Benito sailed his ship St. Francis de la Vega with a mixed crew of Spanish, French, and English sailors. He shared command with Captain Richard Holland, an Irishman who had sailed with the Spanish Navy and as a privateer as early as 1718. Some of his English crew had previously sailed with Edward England and Richard Taylor. They may have been from the East Indiaman Cassandra, which had been captured in the Indian Ocean by EnglandSome sources say Jasper Seagar. then traded to Taylor, who surrendered it to the Spanish in Panama in exchange for a pardon. Though he was commissioned by the Governor of Cuba, Don Benito sailed as far north as the Virginia Capes. There in June 1724 he captured the slave ship John and Mary as well as the Prudent Hannah and Dolphin in quick succession, taking all three as prize ships. They looted the John and Mary of its slaves, rum, gold, and nearly all its supplies. Confronted by the fifth-rate warship HMS Enterprise, they put their prisoners aboard the John and Mary and released it before making their getaway. Shortly afterwards, sailors whom they‚Äôd forced into service aboard the Prudent Hannah mutinied, capturing or killing the prize crew. They sailed it to New York where all but one of the privateers were tried and hung. The Spanish Captain Benito Socarras Y Aguero is likely the same Captain known as Don Benito. He cruised the Caribbean from his base in Santo Domingo as a privateer and guarda costa. Benito Socarras Y Aguero was active for over 30 years, from King William's War through at least 1725.

He previously played for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Career Locastro played high school baseball at Auburn High School and then played at Ithaca College, where he was the Empire 8 player of the year in 2013 when he set school records for runs and stolen bases. He was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 13th round of the 2013 MLB draft and signed with them on June 13. Toronto Blue Jays Locastro played for the Bluefield Blue Jays of the Appalachian League in 2013, hitting .283 in 43 games. The following season, he was selected to play in the Northwest League mid-season all-star game, and he hit .313 in 67 games for the Vancouver Canadians and also stole 32 bases while being caught only four times. He began the 2015 season with the Lansing Lugnuts of the Midwest League, where he hit .310 with 30 steals in 70 games. Los Angeles Dodgers Locastro was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers (along with Chase De Jong) on July 2, 2015 in exchange for three international signing slots. He was assigned to the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes and helped them to the California League championship. He began 2016 with Rancho Cucamonga again and was promoted mid-season to the Double-A Tulsa Drillers. Between the two teams, he was in 131 games, hitting .285 with 24 steals. The Dodgers assigned him to the Glendale Desert Dogs of the Arizona Fall League after the season. In 2017 he was selected to the Texas League mid-season all-star game and between Tulsa and AAA Oklahoma City, he hit .308 in 127 games with 34 steals. Locastro was called up to the majors for the first time on September 29, 2017. He was called up to be evaluated for possible use as an impact pinch runner in the playoffs. He made his MLB debut that night against the Colorado Rockies, running for Corey Seager in the eighth inning and remaining in the game to play an inning in left field. He became the first Ithaca player to play in MLB since Glen Cook appeared in nine games for the Texas Rangers in 1985. The following day, Locastro again appeared as a pinch runner, and stole third base for his first major league steal. He did finally get an at-bat, in his third and final appearance for the Dodgers this season, on October 1. He pinch hit against Adam Ottavino and popped out to second. He was not added to the post-season roster. Locastro was designated for assignment on November 20, 2018. Arizona Diamondbacks The day after being designated, Locastro was traded to the New York Yankees for minor league pitcher Drew Finley and cash. On January 16, 2019, the Yankees traded Locastro to the Arizona Diamondbacks for minor league pitcher Ronald Roman and cash. In 2019 Locastro batted .250/.357/.340, and stole 17 bases without being caught (bringing his career major league record to 22 stolen bases without being caught), leading the major leagues in stolen base percentage. He had the fastest sprint speed of all major league players, at 30.8 feet/second. He finished the season with a BABIP of .243 on ground balls.

Their objective is to restore a sense of normality and continuity to children whose lives have been disrupted by war, natural disaster, or other emergencies. They provide children with opportunities to develop, play, learn, and strengthen resiliency either after a crisis or during a protracted emergency in a safe, child friendly, and stimulating environment. NGOs or governments design and operate CFS in a participatory manner, often relying on community support. They are a short- to medium-term program response and often operate in tents or temporary structures. CFS are one of the most widely used child protection and psychosocial support interventions in emergencies. One reason for their popularity is that they offer potential for adaptability of activities to diverse contexts, rapid deployment, and low relative costs. Different agencies refer to CFS by different names including Child Centered Spaces (CCS), Safe Spaces, Safe Play Areas, and Child Friendly Spaces/Environments (CFS/E). CFS give children an opportunity to escape the crowded living conditions they may be subject to during crises. As they are supervised, they also provide parents child-free time that can be necessary for fetching water, earning a living, or other activities. Given that stress levels and incidents of abuse rise during emergencies, providing children with this space and parents with time can mitigate risks. CFC can be adapted to support young children or adolescents, who are often neglected in emergencies. A view of Mobile Child Friendly Space operated by the Turkish Red Crescent  Background  CFS have been used widely since 1999. They began as a rights-based approach developed by UNICEF to guarantee children's rights to survival, development, participation and protection, especially at times of crisis or instability. UNICEF launched the first CFC during the Kosovo crisis in Albania in April 1999. Subsequently, CFS were used in the camps for the survivors of a 1999 earthquake in Turkey. They then became a common part of the humanitarian response and have since been used in Angola, Chad, Colombia, Denmark, East Timor, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Finland, Germany, Greece, India, Iran, Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Liberia, Mali, Russia, Occupied Palestinian Territories, Pakistan, Paraguay, Philippines, Serbia, Somalia, Spain, Syria, Tanzania, Turkey, and Uganda, among other countries.  Activities  CFC are integrated programs that provide children with access to a range of services or activities that may vary by context. These include structured recreational opportunities, play groups, peer support services, and remedial classes. Some programs involve religious and spiritual activities.  Effectiveness  World Vision and Columbia University, along with Save the Children, UNICEF and others, engaged in a three-year collaborative project to document the outcomes and impacts of CFS. They found that CFS can benefit children, but the extent of their impact varies widely. In many contexts, CFS provide a foundation for positive impact on children's lives, but their impact is small. They also found that younger children tended to attend the CFS more and show greater impact. There have not been longitudinal studies to evaluate the long-term effects of CFS interventions on children.

After eighteen months there, Ford reported to Watertown Arsenal, where he completed Course I at the Ordnance School in June 1927, and Course II in March 1928. He was then enrolled in Ordnance Specialists' School at Raritan Arsenal, and completed the course there in June 1928. In September, he was placed in charge of the Metal Components Section, Ammunition Department, at the Office of the Chief of Ordnance. In 1930, he enrolled at the Army Industrial College and graduated in June 1932. Major Ford completed the two year Command and General Staff course at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in June 1934. During his second summer at Leavenworth, the School was closed, and all students were given temporary assignments with the newly created Civilian Conservation Corps. Ford worked with 250 young men in several national forests in Oregon, opening up trails so that firefighters could more readily gain access to forest fires. In July 1934, Ford began a three year tour as assistant commandant of the Ordnance School at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. The instructional staff at that time numbered but four or five officers, and the student body consisted of about a dozen officers. The Post Commandant also held down the assignment as school commandant. Most instruction was carried on in the second floor (rear) of the present Post Headquarters building. In July 1937, Ford became assistant to the works manager at Springfield Armory, rising to the post of works manager in December 1940. Here he was concerned with development of new weapons, concentrating on the M1 Garand Rifle. The staff at Springfield was very small in the late 1930s, numbering fewer than 200 employees, but this had risen to 11,000 by the time Ford left Springfield for his next assignment. While at Springfield, Ford was twice promoted. In June 1942, Colonel Ford was assigned to the Ordnance Section, Headquarters Services of Supply, in the European Theater of Operations, with primary concern for maintenance matters. In September of that same year, he became Chief Ordnance Officer at Allied Force Headquarters. Still operating in this capacity, he transferred his operations to North Africa in November 1942. In February 1943, he was designated Chief of Staff at Headquarters, North African Theater of Operations, under General Everett Hughes, later to be his predecessor as Chief of Ordnance. While in North Africa, he was promoted to Brigadier General, and in May 1944, he returned to Washington as Chief of the Stock Control Branch, Field Services Division Office, Office of the Chief of Ordnance. The following month, he became Chief of the Reclamation and Maintenance Branch within the Field Services Division. In this office, he had responsibility for rebuilding and reconditioning materiel for use by combat forces overseas. In July 1946, Brigadier General Ford was sent to Europe as Chief of Ordnance to the American forces in the European Theater, and had charge of rebuilding and reconditioning operations, this time in West Germany. Two years later, in June 1948, he returned to Aberdeen Proving Ground as its commanding general, and in August 1949, was promoted to Major General as the 18th Chief of Ordnance for the U.S. Army. During his four-year tour, Ford labored to organize and direct wartime production for the Korean War under peacetime restrictions. A number of plant facilities had to be put back into production capability to manufacture ammunition and other materiel for Korea. Production facilities were also set up in Japan to rebuild weapons and vehicles for use in Korea. Planning and production were complicated by official assumptions that the war would be over within a short period of time. The Army adopted the 280mm atomic cannon in 1952. Other items introduced under Ford's aegis were the 75mm radar controlled Skysweeper anti aircraft gun, the Nike anti aircraft guided missile, and a new series of battle tanks. At the newly created Redstone Arsenal, a spectacular array of new rockets and guided missiles were under development. The Ordnance Department also contributed to the nation's space effort through its research, engineering, and scientific developments. Ford retired from the Army on October 30, 1953 and died in Washington D.C on February 25, 1990, at age 97.

This channel aims to connect sports and entertainment by showing the private lives of sports stars. With this new development, Trace hopes to expand its reach globally so as to free itself from reliance on developed countries  Trace Africa Channels  Trace Africa has ten radio shows with specialized music from all corners of Africa. Two of these, Naija and Mziki, traditionally Zimbabwean music, are a recent addition to Trace Africa. According to Trace‚Äôs chief executive officer Oliver Laouchez \\"Trace is already the leading music brand in Africa. These three new localized music channels will help promote more artists from the three biggest music hubs of Africa and they will better serve the strong need of the local audiences for great local content\\". The premier of these specialized shows was taken with open arms by many Zimbabwean artists because their music is often overshadowed by music from Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya. The Trace Africa Channels include: Guest star- This show provides a closer look at the hot new African artists through exclusive interviews that allow listeners to learn every detail of their favorite stars. 30 African hit- A count-down of the top 30 African music videos 10 sound system- A sound system featuring the best of African Reggae, Dancehall and its Dancehall queens.

Furthermore, with the new trace Africa geography-based channels, Zimbabweans and other artists who have often been overshadowed now have the chance to be seen. This also increases creativity and productivity in local artists.  Trace En  Trace is the overarching brand that encompasses Trace Africa founded in 2011.

He is remembered as a political opponent of Yan Song, on whose initiative he was arrested and eventually executed. The death sentence was later posthumously reversed, and the unjust manner of Yang's death led him to be revered as a martyr for Confucian values. In his lifetime, Yang Jisheng was known by the courtesy name Zhongfang (‰ª≤Ëä≥), but frequently used the art name Jiaoshan (Ê§íÂ±±, \\"Pepper Mountain\\"). He was also granted the posthumous name Zhongmin (Âø†ÊÑç). Early life Yang Jisheng was born on 16 June, 1516, in the village of Beihezhao, located in Rongcheng County. The son of Yang Fu and Cao Shi, he was the youngest of three brothers, the elder two being named Jichang and Jimei. His early life was troubled by domestic disputes, as hostility grew between Madame Cao and his father's concubine Chen who had given birth to Jimei. As a result, the Yang family home was split at least once; the situation worsened after his mother's death, during which time Yang Jisheng began working as a cowherd when he was only seven years old. From an early age, Yang Jisheng received education from a variety of local teachers while simultaneously seeking employment to support his family. At the age of ten, after the death of his father, Yang Jisheng spent the winter managing the finances of a wealthy household, replacing his brother Jichang in that job. He was able to participate in the local civil service examinations for the first time in 1533; while he failed at his first attempt, he successfully passed in the summer, allowing him to apply for and enter the local government school that same year. As a young man he received several offers from wealthy families to marry one of their daughters, but declined all of them in order to marry Zhang Zhen, the niece of his father's concubine Chen, who was closer to his social position and whose virtue he personally admired. They were married in November 1534. Their marriage would produce two sons, named Yingwei and Yingji, and a daughter. In 1536, despite the sudden death of his favorite teacher, Yang Jisheng placed highly at the county-level exams. He did not pass the provincial exams in 1537 and was unable to make a second attempt for several years. A sudden outbreak of illness in his village caused him to drop his studies in order to care for his family, and shortly before the 1540 exams he was forced to come home and deal with a lawsuit brought by corrupt members of a wealthy family who had succeeded in getting his brother Jichang thrown in prison. After securing his brother's release and finally passing the provincial exams in 1540, he unsuccessfully attempted the metropolitan exam in 1541, and then began attending the National University. He also became closely acquainted during this time with the senior court official Xu Jie, who mentored him. He was successful in passing both the metropolitan and palace examinations with high marks in 1547 along with such notables as the future statesman Zhang Juzheng and the renowned writer Wang Shizhen (:zh:Áéã‰∏ñË¥û), the latter of whom became a lifelong friend. Career The beginning of Yang Jisheng's career coincided with prolonged debate over the correct response to raids conducted by Altan Khan. After factional struggle that led to the ouster and execution of war hawks Zeng Xian and Xia Yan, official policy focused on diplomatically engaging with the Mongol nomads by opening horse markets which would hopefully lead to a long-term trade relationship. This strategy was championed by Yan Song, a minister who was now on the ascendant in Ming political circles and who had become hugely influential over the Jiajing Emperor. Upon achieving the jinshi degree, Yang Jisheng was posted to the Ministry of Personnel in Nanjing, where he studied with the elderly statesman and music theorist Han Banqi. By 1551, he had returned to Beijing to take a post at the Ministry of War, where he was privy to discussions on foreign affairs. Shortly after his arrival, he submitted a memorial to the throne highlighting ten reasons why the opening of horse markets was bad for the state, and five fallacies in the common arguments supporting rapprochement with Altan Khan. Although the Jiajing Emperor was initially in favor of the proposal, it was criticized harshly by the party of Yan Song. Consequently, Yang Jisheng was arrested by the Embroidered Uniform Guard and beaten before being demoted and sent to Didao (ÁãÑÈÅì, now Lintao, Gansu province) to serve as a low-ranking judicial official. One of the first things that he did while posted to Didao was to found a school for the promotion of Confucian values. To maintain the school, Yang used his personal funds to purchase considerable land which was divided into a section growing produce for the students and a section composed of individual plots to be rented out for poorer farmers, providing both income for the school and land for the less affluent members of the community. He was successful in opening a coal mine through diplomatic engagement with the residents of the mountain where the mine was located, performing public rituals to appease the local spirits. His tenure in Didao was additionally marked by an anti-corruption campaign against wealthy families that were attempting tax evasion. Following the failure of the diplomatic response to Altan Khan, Yang Jisheng was recalled from Didao a year after being sent into exile. He received multiple promotions in rapid succession until he was once again appointed to serve the Ministry of War in Beijing. Downfall In the early hours of 2 December, 1553, as he recorded in his autobiography, Yang Jisheng stayed up late thinking about his sudden rush of good fortune. His wife, Madame Zhang, approached him to ask about his thoughts; Yang responded by declaring his intention to somehow repay the state for all of the good things which it had bestowed upon him. This sentiment was questioned by his wife, who asked, \\"With a corrupt official like Yan Song in power, how will he allow you to recompense the nation?\\" Versions of this scene by different writers often portray Madame Zhang as expressing more passive sentiments by simply urging her husband to retire, as Yan Song's position was seemingly unassailable. Regardless, this conversation galvanized Yang Jisheng into action, as he resolved to submit a second memorial to the throne, this time specifically impeaching the behavior of Yan Song. Although he listed specific examples of crimes and abuses committed by Yan Song which he wished to expose, Yang Jisheng made the unfortunate mistake of advising the emperor to consult with his two sons, the imperial princes, in order to independently confirm the truth. This was interpreted as an attempt to meddle in court politics, and Yang Jisheng was arrested for the second time by the Embroidered Uniform Guard. He was imprisoned and beaten severely in order to determine if he was part of some larger conspiracy. The effects of this judicial torture took a heavy toll on Yang Jisheng's body. Although he was sent python's gall by his friend, Wang Zhigao (:zh:Áéã‰πãË™•), to mitigate the pain, Yang replied, \\"I have my own gall, what need is there for this snake's?\\" Using pieces of broken ceramic, he was able to treat the severe damage that he had received to his legs by piercing his skin and cleaning the pus from his wounds. The continuing imprisonment of Yang Jisheng was an embarrassment to the Ming court and was widely discussed by literary circles. According to Yang's old friend Wang Shizhen, there were so many copies of the famous memorial condemning Yan Song being circulated that it caused the cost of paper to rise. Several petitions and appeals were made to the Jiajing Emperor requesting clemency, and it seemed that the emperor was reluctant to execute him given his previous loyal service. However, Yan Song was determined that Yang was to die, and so covertly added his name to the warrant that was used to execute Zhang Jing. The Jiajing Emperor signed the warrant without reading it thoroughly and thus accidentally authorized the execution of Yang Jisheng. While waiting for death, Yang Jisheng wrote a set of final instructions containing practical and moral advice for his wife and his two sons. Among his requests were that his concubine, with whom he had not fathered children, be found a worthy husband to support her, and that his sons should be virtuous and take care of the family. He wrote in particular praise of his wife, asking that she raise their daughter in an exemplary manner and urging her not to commit suicide. These recommendations were probably heeded; the literary tradition of Zhang Zhen killing herself in order to join her husband is not uncommon in fictional accounts but is entirely unsupported by historical documents. Yang Jisheng also took the extraordinary step of composing a nianpu, or literary chronicle, about his own life. His memoirs were largely modeled after the example of Wen Tianxiang, who had written a similar text while imprisoned by the Yuan dynasty. The evening before his execution, Yang Jisheng wrote a poem which was preserved on monuments and in later accounts of his life. It reads: Legacy Herbert Giles, in his 1901 review A History of Chinese Literature, declared of Yang Jisheng that \\"his name has no place in literature,\\" and only mentions him in passing to introduce the text of a petition written to the emperor by his wife. This is a minority view, as Yang Jisheng has been the subject of numerous literary works. Following his official posthumous rehabilitation, Yang Jisheng was the subject of laudatory biographies by former allies Wang Shizhen and Xu Jie, who generally praised his conduct, and was memorialized in an elegy by his wife, who addressed him as a \\"hero of eternity.\\" He was also the subject of considerable works in Chinese theater. The play Baojian ji (ÂØ∂ÂäçË®ò, \\"Record of the Precious Sword\\") by Li Kaixian was widely viewed as an echo of Yang Jisheng's career despite being written prior to his traumatic career and death, as it depicted a young official being silenced by a corrupt senior minister. Its influence can be seen in the later play Mingfeng ji (È≥¥È≥≥Ë®ò, \\"The Phoenix's Cry\\"), a straightforward fictionalization of Yang Jisheng's life. The authorship of Mingfeng ji is uncertain, although it has traditionally been attributed to Wang Shizhen as he was Yang Jisheng's most prominent contemporary advocate. The early rulers of the Qing dynasty embraced the history of Yang Jisheng and sought to preserve his memory for their own political ends. The Shunzhi Emperor issued imperial edicts commemorating Yang's life, and was so fond of the play Mingfeng ji that he commissioned an adaptation of that play from the author Ding Yaokang (:zh:‰∏ÅËÄÄ‰∫¢). The new play, published in 1657 was officially titled Biaozhong ji (Ë°®Âø†Ë®ò, \\"Record of Manifesting Loyalty\\") but was better known as Ranshe dan (Ëö∫ËõáËÜΩ, \\"The Python's Gall\\") after the climactic scene in which Yang Jisheng refuses the offered medicine. In 1658, the Shunzhi Emperor commissioned Wu Qi (Âê≥Á∂∫) to write another play, Zhongmin ji (Âø†ÊÑçË®ò, \\"Record of Zhongmin\\"), which was privately performed for the emperor but not printed. Decades later, the Qianlong Emperor personally wrote three poems about the life of Yang Jisheng, praising his steadfast loyalty in the face of death. Since imperial times, political dissidents have often identified with the memory of Yang Jisheng. Along with Fang Xiaoru and Yu Qian, Yang Jisheng was remembered as one of the \\"three exceptional men\\" by the controversial philosopher Li Zhi. Before being executed in 1927, Li Dazhao, co-founder of the Chinese Communist Party, invoked Yang's memory by writing out a couplet stating \\"Bear righteousness and the Way on an iron shoulder, / Write with a quarrelsome hand.\\" Henri Maspero recorded that Yang Jisheng was honored as a tutelary deity for the city of Beijing. Popular veneration and remembrance of Yang Jisheng took place at multiple shrines and temples across the country, including in his former Beijing home and in his natal village of Beihezhao. In Beijing, the Songyun'an (ÊùæÁ≠†Â∫µ, \\"Bamboo and Pine Cloister\\"), where Yang lived, briefly passed into obscurity but received a boost in popularity after a 1786 survey of the city revealed its historical significance. The Songyun'an survived the Cultural Revolution heavily damaged, and since 1984 has been officially listed by the city's Cultural Relics Bureau. Also preserved at the site are historic monuments and the remains of a tree which was said to have been planted by Yang Jisheng while he was in prison, and which was brought down by a powerful storm in 1953. A shrine to Yang Jisheng has stood in Beihezhao since 1567, when his name was officially cleared by imperial edict. The original shrine was expanded and maintained over the centuries until it was completely destroyed in 1967 at the hands of the Red Guards. Funds were raised by the Yang family to establish a smaller building on the spot of the original shrine, which was completed in 1997. Many relics of Yang Jisheng's life did not survive the Cultural Revolution. In 2004, a single antique guqin crafted by Yang Jisheng during his years of musical study went up for auction in Beijing. Its quality, and the fact that it was possibly owned at some point by the artist Zheng Xie, led the Rongbaozhai art dealers to estimate its value as between 600,000 and 1,000,000 yuan.

Early life Holt was the son of Rowland Holt and his wife Elizabeth Washington, and the great-nephew of Sir John Holt, Lord Chief Justice. The Holts were merchants and lawyers. His father died on 25 July 1739 and he succeeded to his estates including Redgrave Hall. He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford on 23 December 1740, aged 17 and undertook a Grand Tour to Italy in about 1746. When in Rome in 1746, he is reported to have dined with the Pretender. First Parliaments Holt was elected Member of Parliament for Suffolk in a by-election on 20 April 1759 as a stop-gap on the death of Sir Cordell Firebrace, Bt. When Sir John Rous, Bt thought of standing for Suffolk at the general election of 1761, Holt complained to his colleague, John Affleck, that he feared he would be greatly out-numbered and that he should be laid aside after being made use of by the county for two years only‚Äô. A compromise was then arranged, whereby Rous stood down on the understanding that room should be made for him in 1768 at the latest, and the 1761 election was uncontested. As the 1768 general election drew near neither of the sitting Members was prepared to abide by the agreement of 1761, and as Rous was determined to stand, all three were nominated at the county meeting on 6 November 1767. But three days later Holt, reflecting on having been forsaken at the meeting by gentlemen on whose support he had counted, took his ‚Äòfinal leave‚Äô of the electors in a letter to them. Redgrave Hall by John Preston Neale Redgrave Hall In another letter to electors Holt explained his decision and concluded by asking leave for the future to build his enjoyments ‚Äòwith more durable materials than the popular breath of such folks as constitute a majority at most public meetings‚Äô. In 1763 he had commissioned Capability Brown to remodel Redgrave Hall and Park in fashionable classical style. He created a sinuous, lake, a Palladian 'rotunda' or round house in one corner of the Park, and a 'water house' (later known as the Kennels) beside the Lake. A decorative Orangery and a red brick stable block were built near the Hall. The work at Redgrave was finally completed in 1773 at a total cost of ¬£30,000.Redgrave Park The Park in the 18th Century Holt also owned a house in London, at 47 Pall Mall. Second Parliaments When Sir John Rous died on 31 October1771, Holt stood for Suffolk again, apparently with support from Grafton and the Administration, against Rous's son, who withdrew from the contest at the county meeting at Stowmarket on 13 November. Holt was returned unopposed in a by-election on 18 December 1771. In the 1774 general election he was again returned unopposed. In 1780 there was the prospect of a contest, but Holt, who seemed unwilling to take part in contested elections, withdrew, and never stood for Parliament again. There is no record of his having spoken in the House during the 18 years he was a Member. Later life Holt died unmarried on 12 July 1786 and the Redgrave estate passed to his brother Thomas.

COPYRIGHT ¬© ATWOOD MAGAZINE 2014-2017 http://atwoodmagazine.com/tmam-of-good-nature- take-anywhere/  Irie Mag  = Respect  Of Good Nature = Posted on November 5, 2015 by Irie Mag Of Good Nature In the four years since they put out their debut album 'Just Add Water' (which won Indie Ville Reggae Album of the Year), Of Good Nature has evolved into a four-piece band. The addition of trombone added the groovy funk element that lead singer and songwriter Cameron Brown felt would complete the band and give him the sound he'd been seeking since their first release. \\"The moment I heard B. Hucks play I knew he was going to play in our group. He finds the right melodies that slide into the song seamlessly. This can bring the trombone to the front of the song, more like a lead instrument, which is pretty uncommon. He knows when to step back and fill overall spaces acting like a keyboard when the song needs it. Unconventional, but perfect for our sound.\\" The tracks on Life Worth Livin have an inherent reggae groove, while Brown consistently works in elements of funk, jam and indie rock, giving the songs room to go in different and compelling directions. From the poppy and funky 'Poppa Kohlly' to the acoustic grace and beauty of 'What Can I Do' to the reggae-rock title-track single that delivers a clear sociopolitical statement, the roots of Brown's musical upbringing are apparent‚Äìfrom blues and classic rock to jam and funk, and of course reggae. The end result is an album that has been favorably compared to Dave Matthews Band, Ballyhoo!, and Tauk. Howi Spangler, lead singer of Ballyhoo! speaking about the title track: \\"The intro guitar/bass riff has that 311-shuffle vibe that I like. I dig that lazy trombone there too. I also like how the song goes more uptempo in the bridge, almost like a jam band. Then they bring it back down to finish it out. Nice to hear a solid American reggae rock song from an East Coast band.\\" The most striking thing listeners will discover is the talented presentation of the many styles on Life Worth Livin; the rock, the funk and the pop elements are well-placed and always add rather than detract from their music. Of course, their reggae is the main attraction here, because as lead singer/songwriter Cameron Brown says, \\"Reggae always just felt right.\\" All things considered, Life Worth Livin transcends the reggae tag, showing not only Of Good Nature's talent at blending eclectic styles, but also their depth, maturity and emotion. Live Worth Livin was recorded at Ocean Industries Studio in Charleston, SC, which is owned by Shinedown bassist Eric Bass. It was produced and engineered by Eric Rickert and Jeff Leonard Jr. (A song they engineered, 'Cut The Cord'-Shinedown, just spent 12 weeks at #1 on the Billboard rock chart‚ÄìIt's now #2.)

The corridors, often built of dry stone, bareley reached man-high and had to be crossed cowered down or crawling.Naturfreunde √ñsterreich & High Tauern National Park (Publisher): Information panel at Tauerngold mining trail. Photo (in German). Because the entries were sometimes covered by cornices some schneekragens kept impassable and dynamite chests like other heavy equipment normally transported with horses had to be dragged through the danger zone. Examples of schneekragens revitalized for touristic purposes can be found in the former gold- and silver mining reviers of the valleys of Rauris and Gastein (both Austria) as well as in the South Tyrolian mining settlement St. Martin am Schneeberg.

It stands as one of the most well known and completely preserved middle Byzantine churches with mural paintings.Carr, Annemarie Weyl. Speculum 80, no. 3 (2005): 999-1001.  History  The church is located by the village of Lagoudera, Cyprus. Similar to other churches in the area, this church was named after a wildflower, the vetch. It was built atop the northeast slopes of Madari, the second highest summit of the Troodos Mountains. The date and circumstances of the church's consecration remain uncertain, but with its location between the villages of Lagoudera and Sarandi, it is postulated that the church was owned privately or that it was a monastery since it was situated away from the villages. Most of the church's history is recorded within its mural paintings. From the inscription of the interior north lintel, it was stated that they were completed in December 1192, and were painted by a Constantinopolitan-trained monk named Theodore Apsevdis. Apsevdis's work could have possibly been commissioned by a Byzantine aristocrat named Leontios Authentes, who was seeking refuge at a nearby monastery built by his father. Around the 14th century, the mural paintings were restored due to water damage and the inscription for these restorations were signed by a deacon named Leontios.Milliner, Matthew John. ‚ÄúThe Virgin of the Passion: Development, dissemination and afterlife of a Byzantine icon type.‚Äù ProQuest Dissertations Publishings. Princeton University. (2011).  Mural Paintings   Virgin of the Passion  The Panagia Arakiotissa This mural was the first of its kind in Komnenian-period art, during the reign of Alexios I Komnenos (), and it was painted in 1192 under the patronage of Leontios Authentes by Theodore Apsevdis on the southeastern wall of the church. Imagery of the Virgin has always been associated with political strength within the Byzantine Empire; however, this particular painting does not hold the same symbolic meaning. Just prior to its conception, the island of Cyprus went through bouts of battles and changes in leadership. This period of turmoil and chaos is reflected in the image depicting the Virgin of the Passion. As stated by the historian Sophocleous: > \\"The donor's grief is perceived through the transformation of the Virgin's > image which he prescribes.\\" This grief is presented in the way that this version differs from the other depictions of the Virgin of Passions. This painting depicts Mary in full length, standing in front of her throne, holding the Christ child as opposed to other depictions of her from the shoulders up. Additionally, the angels bearing the spear and the cross (a reference to Christ's future) are as large as Jesus whereas other versions of this icon, the angels are small and indiscernible to the composition. This emphasis on the angels carrying symbols of Christ's passion and the depiction of the Virgin standing holding her child, could be interpreted as the Virgin handing her child to His fate, just as she is offering up the island of Cyprus to many of its volatile leaders. Accompanying the painting is an elaborate prayer to the Virgin which also helps indicate the patron for this particular mural painting.  Saint Simeon and Saint John the Baptist  Across from the Virgin of Passion is the mural painting of Saint Simeon, holding Christ child with Saint John the Baptist standing next to him. The placement of this painting has implication of the Presentation in the Temple scene in the New Testament. According to Luke 2.22-29, the elder Symeon rushed to see the Christ child as it was prophesied that he would not die until he saw the \\"Anointed of the Lord.\\" Additionally, the presence of St. John the Baptist carries significant meaning in suggesting the fate of Christ and his sacrifice. This foreshadowing of Christ's future is written in the scroll held by St. John the Baptist stating: > \\"Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.\\" Also, the positioning of this painting could also refer to the purification rituals that was performed on the Virgin as was the custom for the mother to be purified in a temple forty days after the birth of the first born son.Baltoyianni, Chrysanthe. \\"Christ the Lamb and the ·ºêŒΩœéœÑŒπŒøŒΩ of the Law in a Wall Painting of Araka on Cyprus.\\" ŒîŒµŒªœÑŒØŒøŒΩ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ±ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒëœÅœáŒ±ŒπŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒïœÑŒ±ŒπœÅŒµŒØŒ±œÇ 17 (1993): 53-58.  Preservation and conservation  The preservation of the mural paintings within this church was sponsored by Dumbarton Oaks Research Center and Collection. David and June Winfield oversaw the preservation project from 1968 until 1973. Within those years, the Winfields wrote detailed reports of their process in restoring the mural paintings for Dumbarton Oaks. Within these reports, they would describe such things as the differences in brushwork and usage of colors between Theodore Apsevdis and the deacon Leontios. They also made note of the materials used (ultramarine, vermilion, gold leaf and silver), these ingredients could be found locally in the valley.

Much of the original forest has been replaced by secondary forests. Geography The Guizhou Plateau broadleaf and mixed forests occupy the eastern portion of the Yungui Plateau. The forests are found throughout most of Guizhou province, extreme northeastern Yunnan, southeastern Sichuan, southeastern Chongqing, southwestern Hubei, and western Hunan. The geology in this part of the Yungui Plateau is composed of mostly Paleozoic limestone where there are poor quality soils and extreme karst topography. Human development in this part of China has been limited due to the nature of terrain where large pits, caves, natural arches, and disappearing rivers are not uncommon. Flora Despite the high level of precipitation, flora in this ecoregion is prone to drought stress because karstic soils here are porous and do not retain water. In the northern parts of the Guizhou Plateau ecoregion, Chinese red pine is a major species while Yunnan pine dominates in the south. Broadleaf taxa include Rhododendron, Quercus, Sterculia, Erythrina, Ficus, Eugenia, Helicia. The first-class protected plant species in the Guizhou Plateau broadleaf and mixed forests are Cathaya argyrophylla, Taiwania flousiana, Cyathea spinulosa, and the revered Davidia involucrata. Fauna The Guizhou snub-nosed monkey is endemic to this ecoregion. Other notable animal species include the Assamese macaque, Francois‚Äô leaf monkey, clouded leopard, leopard, tiger, Sika deer, and red goral. Conservation While much of the original subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests in this ecoregion has been extirpated due to habitat conversion, secondary forests, seasonal tropical forests, and conifer forests now dominate. Remaining tracts of the original forest vegetation can still be found in protected areas and along inaccessible hills. Protected areas include Wulingyuan, Mount Fanjing, and Zhangjiajie.

Pausanias reported in his Descriptions of Greece that the Alcmaeonids hired him to build a temple at Delphi. This is the only record of Spintharus. The temple to Apollo at Delphi had to be rebuilt after a fire in 548 BC and again after an earthquake in 373 BC. Historians have offered competing claims as to which temple Spintharus constructed. Debate on chronology J. B. Bury argued he built the 6th century temple because of accounts saying the fourth century temple was built by Xenodorus. John Henry Middleton dated Spintharus's construction to the latter half of the sixth century, BC. Karl Julius Sillig wrote Spintharus lived around the time of the 60th Olympiad, i.e., 540 BC. However, James George Frazer argued he built the fourth century temple. He notes that Xenodorus is inscribed as the fourth century architect, but suggests Spintharus planned and began construction and Xenodorus continued construction after his death. Janina K. Darling reports Spintharus began construction in 346 BC and after his death the project was completed by the architects Xenodorus and Agathon. H√©l√®ne Perdicoyianni- Pal√©ologou also lists all three architects as working on the rebuilding of the temple, which was completed in 320 BC. William Bell Dinsmoor notes that expense reports suggest that Xenodorus and Agathon continued Spintharus' construction on the fourth century temple. Other possible works Middleton also suggested Spintharus also built the temple at Corinth due to similarities in some of the details such as the hypotrachelia.

It was established as a professional company in 1968 as the Children's Arena Theatre and focused primarily on schools performances. Over its 55 year history, Arena Theatre has become known for integrating live theatre with cutting edge technology. In 2017, Arena moved its base from Melbourne to Bendigo and now a resident company at Bendigo Venues and Events' Engine Room.  History   1996-1970  Arena Theatre Company began in 1966 when founder Naomi Marks, despondent by the lack of appropriate children's theatre, travelled overseas to \\"find out what was happening for children in the rest of the world\\". She was particularly impressed by the work of The Theatre Centre in London, and brought back The Crossroads by Brian Way to perform in Australia. Along with Elaine Clark, Robin Ramsay and Anne Sutherland, they created the Toorak Players Children's Theatre and performed The Crossroads on 18 May 1966 at the Mackenzie Theatre attached to the Toorak Presbyterian Church. In June 1968, the Toorak Players Children‚Äôs Theatre became known as Children‚Äôs Arena Theatre as the team formed the professional theatre company. Marks was very insistent in these early days that Children‚Äôs Arena Theatre plays be educational as well as entertaining as she noted \\"I don‚Äôt want the cast to go to the schools, leave after the performances and then be forgotten. It should not be a wasted few houses and purely entertainment for the children. I want them to become involved. I want drama to become part of the junior school curriculum‚Ä¶.just so long as they benefit from it. Drama develops a child‚Ä¶drama can bring so much life to schooling.  1970-1980  Children‚Äôs Arena Theatre appointed their first Artistic Director in 1970, Roger Moulton from England. He migrated to Australia because of the exciting potential of children‚Äôs theatre here. In 1975 John O‚ÄôMay took over as Artistic Director. He had previously been working as an actor with CAT in the Common Grounds project. He promoted Australian content, and in 1976 CAT developed an all Australian program for the primary school tour throughout the year. Peter Tulloch, a former actor with CAT took over as Artistic Director in 1977 and expanded the holiday programs and workshops. Arena also began to umbrella small up and coming companies such as Bow-Tie and Mixed Company. 1981 saw Peter Charlton take charge and began reinstating high quality production values and increased theatre productions.  1980-1990  In 1982 Children‚Äôs Arena Theatre shortened their name to Arena Theatre to remove the reference to children, which was limiting them from performing to secondary schools. Director Trina Parker explained \\" It was a deliberate‚Ä¶.attempt to take away the‚Ä¶[patronising label] and be able to do plays for upper secondary. We found it very difficult to sell plays to secondary schools under the title Children‚Äôs Arena Theatre because secondary kids do not regard themselves as children\\".  1990-2000  In 1996, Rosemary Myers designed an ambitious creative project entitled AnthroPOPtrilogy, which consisted of three separate plays, Autopsy, Mass and Panacaea. She collaborated with Bruce Gladwin, Hugh Covill and Julienne O‚ÄôBrien to create these works. This hybrid theatre focused on projection techniques, kinetic art, amplified music and fragmented narrative. In 1999, Arena received the Honorary President‚Äôs Award of the International Association of Theatre for Children and Young People (ASSITEJ). The judging panel for the award cited Arena‚Äôs multimedia approach as indicative of a new direction for theatre for young people.  2000-2010  Rosemary Myers left the company in 2008 and was succeeded by Chris Kohn, former Artistic Associate.\\".

Born in El Salvador and trained as a teacher, she moved to Honduras at the age of twenty. Joining the socialist movement, she became a party operative, founding trade unions to resist the labor practices of the industrialists operating in the country. She formed the first feminist organization of Honduras, the Society of Feminist Culture, in 1923 and organized night schools for working women to teach them about their rights. Expelled from Honduras for leading demonstrations against the government in 1944, she fled home to El Salvador but remained only a few months because a coup d'etat brought in a dictatorship. Relocating to Guatemala, Garc√≠a continued with her activities organizing labor and educating working-class people, until she was expelled by the president in 1946. Moving to Mexico, she worked for the Secretariate of Education and wrote articles in support of leftist politics and women. Early life Mar√≠a Graciela Amaya Barrientos was born on 11 January 1895 in San Salvador, El Salvador to Mar√≠a Dolores Barrientos and Jos√© Bernardino Amaya. Her maternal grandfather was Felipe Barrientos, a lawyer and military general and her cousin Fernando Barrientos was a labor organizer. Her mother died when she was two years old and she was raised by her grandmother along with her only sibling, Felipe Armando. Amaya attended the Escuela Normal de Maestras in San Salvador learning pedagogy and taught in schools in El Salvador. In 1915, she and her father moved to Tegucigalpa, Honduras and the following year, she married Jose Garc√≠a Lardizabel. Her father discouraged her from working and she spent several years taking care of her young son, T√≥mas. In the early 1920s, her brother, Armando, who had been a socialist labor organizer in the United States joined the family in Honduras and introduced Garc√≠a to the ideas of socialism. Career By 1921, Garc√≠a, her brother Armando, V√≠ctor M. Angulo, Manuel C√°lix Herrera, and Carlos G√≥mez were recruited by Juan Pablo Wainwright as Marxist labor organizers. He led them in organizing strikes in Northern Honduras against the banana producing companies and railroads for higher wages and benefits. Under the umbrella organization, Honduran Workers' Federation (), the various members created member labor unions. Garc√≠a headed the union Redenci√≥n, which was a member of FOH. In 1923, she founded the Society of Feminist Culture (, which was a socialist women's group aimed at organizing working women. It was the first feminist group created in Honduras and worked in resistance to the government. The group founded night schools for women which gave forums to teach women about their rights and equality. The organization also published a newsletter to discuss topics about women's issues and emancipation. Garc√≠a continued her organizing activities, distributing pamphlets, but conflicts between the FOH and the Communist Party of Honduras forced the dissolution of the FOH in 1929. In that year, she and her brother participated with C√°lix to organize a congress of workers and peasant congress at the port of Tela. Held on 29 May, the congress sparked the creation of the Honduran Trade Union Federation () which initially organized dock and railroad workers and later organized the United Fruit Company workers. By 1930, led by Wainright, the FSH were initiating strikes against the Standard Fruit Company and United Fruit. Wainright was singled out as an instigator and was captured and executed in 1932. Later that same year, the FSH brought another strike against Standard Fruit and the Truxillo Railroad Company. They supported C√°lix in a bid for the presidency, but when the dictator, Tiburcio Car√≠as Andino won the 1932 election, he outlawed the communist party. Garc√≠a continued her organization and strike activities, having to operate from clandestine locations until 1944. She led demonstrations in front of the presidential residence in May and June calling for the release of political prisoners. In July of that year, mass protests were held against the government of Car√≠as and Garc√≠a was arrested an imprisoned. She and her brother were expelled and returned to El Salvador. She joined the National Union of Workers (), which was affiliated with the illegal Communist Party of El Salvador and continued her organizing efforts. Joining Women Committee, she participated in the presidential campaign for Arturo Romero, who was one of the candidates to replace the temporary president Andr√©s Ignacio Men√©ndez. When the coup d'etat by Osm√≠n Aguirre y Salinas ended the elections in October 1944, Garc√≠a fled to Guatemala. In Guatemala, Garc√≠a organized the Salvadoran Liberation Committee to support exiles from El Salvador and rebels fighting against Aguirre. Her son, T√≥mas, though a third- year medical student, joined the resistance and was killed in a battle in December 1944 when a group of militants overtook Ahuachap√°n in an attempt to overthrow the Aguirre regime. In 1945, she became one of the founders of the Confederation of Workers of Guatemala and organized a school Claridad (Clarity) to train workers, as she had done earlier in Honduras. Opposition to trade unions by conservative factors in the society led to Garc√≠a's expulsion by Guatemalan president Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo in February 1946. She and her husband fled to Mexico City and continued to work for the resistance movement against Carias' dictatorship. She took employment with the Secretariat of Public Education, where she worked from 1946 to 1979. She also remained active in trade unions and leftist political movements, publishing articles in various newspapers, such as El Popular and the bi-monthly journal Pagenias de Ayer y de Hoy. Garc√≠a published her memoirs, P√°ginas de lucha revolucionaria en Centroam√©rica (Pages from the revolutionary fight in Central America) in 1971 and En las trincheras de a lucha por el socialismo (In the trenches of the fight for Socialism) in 1975. In 1977, she was invited to attend a tribute held in her honor at the National Autonomous University of Honduras. She attended the event, which represented the first time she had returned to Central America in over three decades. After the tribute, a collective feminist group called Graciela Amaya Garc√≠a (GAG) was founded by a group of women at the university to honor and recognize Garc√≠a's contribution to women's rights and education in the country. Their goal was to educate their members on feminist ideals. Death and legacy Garc√≠a died on 11 October 1995 in Mexico City, three months before her 101st birthday. She is remembered in Honduras as the founder of the women's movement and throughout Central America for her fight for laborers.

Her sister Gertrud was a women's rights activist, while her sister, Maria Adelborg, also became an artist. She showed early talent for drawing and studied at the Royal Academy of Art (1878-1884), and she later furthered her art education with trips to the Netherlands (1898) and Italy (1901) as well as France.

These and other of her early works led to Adelborg being called \\"the creator of the Swedish picture book for children\\". Her style has been compared to that of both Crane and Elsa Beskow. She also designed wallpaper patterns and home furnishings. In 1911, she designed the poster for the first major exhibition of women artists held in Sweden. Adelborg was very interested in handicrafts and in 1899 became a member of the executive board of the newly formed Swedish Handicraft Association. In 1903, she moved to Gagnef, where she founded a school for lace-making and a local \\"Memory House\\" (Minesstugan) housing local crafts and historical artefacts. She died in Gagnef in 1936. Her work is held by the Ottilia Adelborg Museum in Gagnef, by the Zorn Museum, and by the National Museum in Stockholm.

Biography Petroviƒá, a three-time national champion, played Davis Cup tennis for Yugoslavia. He also competed several times at both the French Championships and Wimbledon. Although he held a law degree from the University of Zagreb, he chose not to practise law as he would have been required to join the Communist Party. His most noted performance in a Grand Slam tournament was reaching the third round of the 1951 Wimbledon Championships. He won five set matches in both of the opening two rounds, then had his run ended by American Ham Richardson. In 1952 he made his Davis Cup debut in a tie against Finland and also featured in a tie with Great Britain, in which he had a win over Roger Becker. The following year he took part in a tie against France in his native Croatia, where he lost a marathon five setter to Robert Haillet, but was able to defeat Robert Abdesselam in the reverse singles. He finished his Davis Cup career with an 8/10 overall record from seven ties, the last in 1955, just months before he defected. With Yugoslavia under Communist rule, Petroviƒá made the decision to defect in 1955. His wife Georgia, a renowned table tennis player, had temporarily left the country on a student exchange program, which gave him an opportunity to seek asylum when he travelled to England for the 1955 Wimbledon Championships. He ended up in Germany, where he remained based for the next four years. In 1958 he won the Dutch Championships and made his last appearance at Wimbledon, beaten by eventual runner-up Neale Fraser. In 1959 he moved to Los Angeles with his family. His son Glenn, who was born in Germany, went on to compete on the professional tennis circuit as an American.

History In January 1937 German Freedom Radio was established by the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Its transmitter and studios were located in Madrid, but editorial direction was largely determined by the KPD leadership based in Paris. Ernest Hemingway and Heinrich Mann both are recorded as having written scripts for German Freedom Radio. In March 1939, German Freedom Radio was forced off-air as Madrid fell to the Spanish Nationalist forces. It resurfaced in Moscow, signing on-air on September 10, 1941, as German People's Radio and using the slogan \\"the Voice of the International Peace Movement\\". Programming Operated by the KPD and largely staffed by Germans, German People's Radio broadcasts were designed to demoralize the German military and to inspire subversive acts within Germany. In order to inflate perceptions of the operational capacity of the underground resistance to the Nazi Party, programs were presented as though they originated from inside Germany and that the station was a pirate radio broadcaster operated by Germany-based critics of Adolf Hitler. The Associated Press re-reported some broadcasts of German People's Radio; on July 27, 1944, it cited German People's Radio in describing that \\"demonstrations were spreading throughout Upper Silesia\\" and that \\"anti-Hitler opposition groups\\" had been staging protests in the coal mining districts of K√∂nigsh√ºtte, Hindenburg, Gleiwitz, and Breslau. The same year it reported on a German People's Radio story that \\"foreign workers\\" had ambushed an SS unit near Berlin and fought a three-day battle against it. Though it predated Soldatensender Calais, later broadcasts of German People's Radio were reportedly inspired by it. Staff Markus Wolf, later head of the Main Directorate for Reconnaissance of the German Democratic Republic's Ministry of State Security, worked as a newsreader on German People's Radio from 1943 to 1945. Other people who worked at the station at various times included Walter Ulbricht, Erich Weinert, Hedda Zinner, Anton Ackermann, Willi Bredel, and Wilhelm Pieck.

He was one of the founding members in the International Society of Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) and the French Society of Medical Mycology. After Edouard Drouhet's death, Edouard Drouhet is commemorated at the European Confederation of Medical Mycology by having a lecture and a medal dedicated in his name.  Personal life  Drouhet was born in B√¢rlad, Romania into a family of French descent that also included Charles Drouhet. His grandfather was a medical doctor in Blaye, France. Victoria Drouhet was Edouard Drouhet's spouse.  Education  In 1944, he received his doctorate in medicine from the University of Bucharest. However, the diploma from Bucharest was not considered equivalent to the education in France and he was expected to pass baccalaureat to thesis diplomas in France. In 1947, Drouhet studied microbiology at the Institut Pasteur and in 1948 studied serology and dermatology at the Institut Fournier.  Career  Throughout Drouhet's life, he held many positions in which he was able to build upon and connect the mycologist community. In 1948, Drouhet was appointed the position of a research associate at Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS). In 1953, he became Head of Laboratory at the Pasteur Institute under Professor Magrou. At the Pasteur Institute, he met Gabriel Segretain and Francois Mariat. The colleagues formed a team that promoted awareness and advanced the field of medical mycology in France and Europe. Together, they organized a post-graduate course in medical mycology which had trained hundreds of mycologists in France and other foreign entities. In addition, they founded the French Society of Medical Mycology. Gabriel Segretain and Edouard Drouhet co-founded ISHAM which is a community for clinical scientists and researchers interested in fungal ailments and fungus-like diseases. In 1996, the trio received the E. Brumpt Prize of the Society of Exotic Pathology. In 1972, Drouhet was appointed as professor at Institut Pasteur. In this position, he formed the National Reference Center for Mycoses and Antifungals. Then, in 1981 he would take the place of Grabriel Segretain as Director of the Mycology Unit at Pasteur Institute until he retired in 1987. After retirement, Drouhet continued in his involvement in the scientific community by serving as the Chief Editor for the Journal of Medical Mycology until he fell ill in 1999. Towards the end of his career, he was able to publish and share his identification of a new thermally dimorphic fungal species, Emmonsia pasteuriana, which was first cultured on a woman with HIV from Italy.Gori, S., Drouhet, E., Gueho, E., Huerre, M., Lofaro, A., Parenti, M., & Dupont, B. (1998). Cutaneous disseminated mycosis in a patient with AIDS due to a new dimorphic fungus. Journal de mycologie m√©dicale, 8(2), 57-63.  Notable work  Prior to Drouhet's influence, Institut Pasteur mainly studied fungal pathogens on botany. Since then, Drouhet had opened up the field to include human and animal fungal pathogens as well. Drouhet's work looked into diseases of opportunistic fungi pathogens in humans and animals and he was the first in France to test the antifungal agents. He extensively studied the serum of fungal antigens such as fluconazole, ketoconazole, amphotericin-B, fluorocytosin, and itraconazole which helped standardize the medical dosage and treatments for patients.Dupont, B., & Drouhet, E. (1987). Cryptococcal meningitis and fluconazole. Annals of Internal Medicine, 106(5), 778-778.Dupont, B., & Edouard Drouhet. (1987). Early Experience with Itraconazole in Vitro and in Patients: Pharmacokinetic Studies and Clinical Results. Reviews of Infectious Diseases, 9, S71-S76. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/4454069 In 1978, Drouhet published a textbook called \\"Fungal Antigens ‚Äì Isolation, Purification and Detection\\" which was conceived after a symposium on fungal antigens.Drouhet, E., Cole, G. T., De Repentigny, L., & Latge, J. (2013). Fungal Antigens: Isolation, Purification, and Detection. Springer Science & Business Media. The book goes in depth of chemical techniques, methods of diagnosing infections, and includes studies on Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Coccidiodes immitis, and many more contributed by a collection of other authors.Drouhet, E., Cole, G. T., De Repentigny, L., & Latge, J. (2013). Fungal Antigens: Isolation, Purification, and Detection. Springer Science & Business Media. In Drouhet and Dupont's publication of ‚ÄúLaboratory and Clinical Assessment of Ketoconazole in Deep-Seated Mycoses‚Äù, they studied how patients with deep mycoses reacted with treatments of ketoconazole and amphotericin B. Both of which, were ineffective to treating mycoses as separate medications. The cases included a wide range of mycoses such as candidiasis, histoplasmosis, African blastomycosis, mycetoma, fungal arthritis, and newly discovered cases of cutaneous, ocular and osteoarticular manifestations of candidiasis in young heroin addicts. Another noteworthy publication of Drouhet's is, ‚ÄúEarly experience with itraconazole in vitro and in patients: pharmacokinetic studies and clinical results‚Äù when itraconazole was considered a new antifungal agent.Dupont, B., & Edouard Drouhet.

They lived there during a period in the late 1980s and early 1990s when Detroit and many other major American cities were gaining widespread reputations for crime and violence, largely due to an influx of cocaine and the emergence of the crack cocaine epidemic. Wershe's father was also an FBI informant and first reported to the police and the federal agency alongside him before going solo. The name \\"White Boy Rick\\" was not a street name that Wershe used himself, nor was it one he was ever called by those with whom he associated. The name was instead given to him by reporters who covered his case. When Wershe was 16 the FBI, having secured 20 convictions through his infiltration of a violent drug gang, ceased to employ him as an informant. In 1987, at 17 years of age, Wershe was arrested for possessing cocaine in excess of eight kilograms (17.6 pounds). He was sentenced to life in prison in Michigan under the state's 650-Lifer Law, a drug statute that penalized those found in possession of more than 650 grams (22.92 oz) of cocaine or heroin with life imprisonment without parole. The law was overturned but he was rejected as a menace to society by the Michigan Parole Board in 2003, despite (or perhaps because of) having assisted the FBI in the 1990s with a sting unsuccessfully targeting Gil Hill and drawing in the relatives of influential city politicians. Publicity about the case in 2017, when by which time he had spent nearly three decades behind bars in Michigan as a nonviolent drug offender whose offense was committed when he was 17, led to him being paroled, but directly to US Marshals who took him to begin serving five years in Florida State Prison on a 2008 car theft ring conviction (crime committed behind bars). In 2019, his application was denied by the Florida clemency board.

Unlike physical sales or downloads, which pay artists a fixed price per song or album sold, Spotify pays royalties based on the artist's \\"market share\\"‚Äîthe number of streams for their songs as a proportion of total songs streamed on the service. Spotify distributes approximately 70% of its total revenue to rights holders, who then pay artists based on their individual agreements. Multiple artists have criticised the policy, most notably Thom Yorke and Taylor Swift, who temporarily withdrew their music from the service. Spotify faces particular scrutiny due to its free service tier, which allows users to listen free with advertisements between tracks. The tier has led to a variety of major album releases being delayed or withdrawn from the service. Spotify claims it benefits the industry by migrating users away from piracy and less monetized platforms and encouraging them to upgrade to paid accounts. Record labels keep a large amount of Spotify earnings. Spotify has also attracted media attention for several security breaches, as well as for controversial moves including a significant change to its privacy policy, \\"pay-for-play\\" practices based on receiving money from labels for putting specific songs on popular playlists, and allegedly creating \\"fake artists\\" for prominent playlist placement, which Spotify denies.  Business practices   Allegations of unfair artist compensation  Spotify, together with the music streaming industry in general, faces criticism from some artists and producers, claiming they are being unfairly compensated for their work as music sales decline and music streaming increases. Unlike physical sales or legal downloads, which pay artists a fixed price per song or album sold, Spotify pays royalties based on their \\"market share\\"‚Äîthe number of streams for their songs as a proportion of total songs streamed on the service. Spotify distributes approximately 70% of its total revenue to rights-holders, who will then pay artists based on their individual agreements. The variable (and some say unsustainable) nature of this compensation, has led to criticism. In a 2009 Guardian article, Helienne Lindvall wrote about why \\"major labels love Spotify\\", writing that the labels receive 18% of shares from the streaming company‚Äîsomething that artists themselves never actually get. She further wrote that \\"On Spotify, it seems, artists are not equal. There are indie labels that, as opposed to the majors and Merlin members, receive no advance, receive no minimum per stream, and only get a 50% share of ad revenue on a pro-rata basis (which so far has amounted to next to nothing).\\" In 2009, Swedish musician Magnus Uggla pulled his music from the service, stating that after six months he had earned \\"what a mediocre busker could earn in a day\\". Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet reported in 2009 that the record label Racing Junior earned only NOK 19 ($3.00 USD) after their artists had been streamed over 55,100 times. According to an infographic by David McCandless, an artist on Spotify would need over four million streams per month to earn the U.S. minimum monthly wage of $1,160. In October 2011, U.S. independent label Projekt Records stated: \\"In the world I want to live in, I envision artists fairly compensated for their creations, because we (the audience) believe in the value of what artists create. The artist's passion, dedication, and expression is respected and rewarded. Spotify is NOT a service that does this. Projekt will not be part of this unprincipled concept.\\" In March 2012, Patrick Carney of The Black Keys said that \\"Spotify isn't fair to artists\\", and further commented that streaming services \\"are becoming more popular, but it still isn‚Äôt at a point where you‚Äôre able to replace royalties from record sales with the royalties from streams. For a band that makes a living selling music, it's not at a point where it‚Äôs feasible for us.\\" Replying to Spotify board member Sean Parker's claim that Spotify would make more money for the music industry than iTunes, Carney said: \\"That guy has $2 billion that he made from figuring out ways to steal royalties from artists, and that's the bottom line. You can't really trust anybody like that.\\" In May 2012, British Theatre vocalist and Biffy Clyro touring guitarist Mike Vennart stated: \\"I'd sooner people stole my work than stream it from [Spotify]. They pay the artists virtually nothing. Literally pennies per month. Yet they make a killing. They've forced the sales way down in certain territories, which wouldn't be so bad if the bands actually got paid.\\" Singer David Byrne of Talking Heads criticized streaming services such as Spotify in October 2013, writing: \\"If artists have to rely almost exclusively on the income from these services, they'll be out of work within a year.\\" Byrne concluded his piece by admitting \\"I don't have an answer.\\" In March 2014, American funk band Vulfpeck exposed a loophole in Spotify's royalty calculation model. The band created an album titled Sleepify, which consisted solely of silence. The band asked users to stream the album on a loop while they slept to increase the amount of money earned. The album was pulled by Spotify in April 2014, citing unspecified service violation. Vulfpeck had accumulated enough streams to result in around $20,000 in royalties before the album was pulled. In July 2015, Neil Young removed almost all of his music from Spotify and other streaming services, citing low sound quality as the primary reason. He stated that he did not think his fans deserved the low quality they were receiving, and said it was bad for his music. Young's music has since returned to Spotify and other streaming services. In response, Spotify claims that they are benefiting the music business by \\"migrating them away from piracy and less monetized platforms, and allowing them to generate far greater royalties than before\\" by offering a free, ad-supported service tier, and then encouraging users to opt into the paid subscription. In an additional response on July 31, 2020, Hypebeast reported Ceo Daniel Ek's recent stance in their article called \\"Billionaire Spotify CEO Wants Musicians to Work Harder, Stop Complaining About Streaming Royalties\\". On August 2, 2020, MarketWatch reported on the artist's response to Daniel Ek's implication that they should work harder in an article called \\"Musicians Have Some Choice Words For Spotify Ceo Daniel Ek Who Says They Should Work Harder\\". On October 14, 2020, a Spotify Inventor's response to the general allegation of unfair compensation was also released by independent artist Ashley Jana in the form of an audio recording on YouTube The recording features excerpts from an interview that took place on June 14, 2019 at the NYC Sync Summit at Les Poisson Rouge (where Jim Anderson, a Spotify Inventor who was described on the Sync Summit website as \\"The man who built out the system architecture of Spotify\\") was a guest speaker. Jim Anderson can also be found on Angel's List underneath Spotify Ceo Daniel Ek in the Spotify \\"People\\" column. In the released recording, Jim Anderson made several comments in response to Ashley Jana's question, which centered around the general allegation of unfair artist compensation. Some of the comments that Jim Anderson made in response were the following: \\" So, maybe I should go down the entitlement road now? Or should I wait a few minutes?\\", \\" Kay. Okay, so we should talk about entitlement. Alright. I mean, I have an issue with Taylor Swift's comments.\\" , \\" The problem is this. Spotify was created to solve a problem. The problem was this - piracy and music distribution. The problem was to get artists' music out there to solve a problem. The problem was not to pay people money.\\", \\" I mean, I consider myself an artist because I'm an inventor, okay? Now, I freely give away my patents for nothing. I never collect royalties on anything.\\", \\"I think that Taylor Swift doesn't need .000001 cent more a stream.\\", and \\" This wor.. world right now we live in is built also on entitlement. Right now today, everybody here in this younger world here - everybody seems to think about entitlement.\\". The artist who released the recording stated within the video caption that she has access to the full recording, and that she can be compared to Woodward. = Support to Spotify = In June 2012, Charles Caldas, CEO of the Merlin Network (a representative body for over 10,000 independent labels), clarified that Spotify pays royalties to the music labels, and not the artists. According to Caldas, the payments Merlin‚Äôs labels received from Spotify rose 250 percent from the year ending March 2011 to the year ending March 2012, while at the time, the revenue per user was \\"the highest it has been since the launch of the service\\". Caldas said that Merlin had observed \\"consistent, ongoing growth on revenue per user, revenue per stream, and the total revenue\\" that Spotify generates for the labels it represents. \\"The thing about ‚ÄòSpotify doesn‚Äôt pay artists enough‚Äô‚ÄîSpotify doesn‚Äôt pay artists... They pay labels\\", said Caldas. Caldas also highlighted the issue of time lag for artists, as they are not gaining an impression of Spotify's status at the time they receive their payments. They are \\"getting reporting quarterly, or six-monthly, on sales that happened six months ago.\\" Caldas explained that \\"royalty statements could be a year old\\". In February 2015, Music Business Worldwide reported on a French study between music trade body SNEP and EY that concluded that major labels kept 73% of Spotify Premium payouts, while writers/publishers received 16%, and artists received 11%. Mike Masnick of Techdirt wrote: \\"Sure, in the past, it may have been reasonable for the labels to take on large fees for distribution, but that's when it meant manufacturing tons of plastic and vinyl, and then shipping it to thousands of record stores around the globe. In this case, there's no manufacturing, and distribution is an \\"upload\\" button. = Spotify's \\"artist-in-residence\\" aid = In February 2012, Forbes reported on \\"Spotify's secret weapon\\": musician D. A. Wallach, member of the band Chester French and former Harvard classmate of Mark Zuckerberg. He acts as Spotify's \\"artist-in-residence\\" and helps Spotify \\"brainstorm artist- friendly applications that can be carved from the gusher of data it collects\\". One such application includes geographical data of which cities listen to artists' music the most as suitable tour locations. He told Forbes: > We're working very carefully to make Spotify the most artist-friendly > company that has ever existed. ... We‚Äôre very interested in a high level of > letting artists directly connect to their fans and manage that relationship > and deliver value to their fans, and vice versa. We want to do that really > elegantly, at a scale that's never existed before. In a June interview with Hypebot, Wallach reported that $180 million of royalties was paid out in 2011 and 70% of Spotify's revenue consisted of royalty payments. Spotify's growth meant that the per-stream royalty rate doubled between the service's inception and mid-2012. He said that, at the time, compared to iTunes, the average listener spends $60 annually on music, whereas Spotify Premium users spend twice that amount. According to Wallach in 2012: \\"The growth of the platform is proportional to the royalty pay out, and since inception, we‚Äôve already doubled the effective per play rate.\\" = Artist withdrawals =  Thom Yorke  Radiohead singer Thom Yorke (front) and producer Nigel Godrich (rear) have accused Spotify of not supporting new artists fairly. In July 2013, Radiohead singer Thom Yorke and producer Nigel Godrich removed their band Atoms for Peace and Yorke's solo music from Spotify. In a tweet, Yorke stated: \\"Make no mistake‚Äînew artists you discover on #Spotify will not get paid. Meanwhile, shareholders will shortly be rolling in it. Simples.\\" Godrich stated: \\"[Streaming] cannot work as a way of supporting new artists' work. Spotify and the like either have to address that fact and change the model for new releases, or else all new music producers should be bold and vote with their feet.\\" In an October 2013 interview with Mexican website Sopitas, Yorke said: \\"I feel like as musicians, we need to fight the Spotify thing. I feel that, in some ways, what's happening in the mainstream is the last gasp of the old industry. Once that does finally die, which it will, something else will happen.\\" He described Spotify as \\"the last desperate fart of a dying corpse\\". Spotify responded in a statement that it was \\"still in the early stages of a long-term project that's already having a hugely positive effect on artists and new music\\", and that it is \\"100% committed to making Spotify the most artist-friendly music service possible, and are constantly talking to artists and managers about how Spotify can help build their career\\". In 2015, Brian Message, partner at Radiohead's management company Courtyard Management, stated that he disagreed with Yorke, noting that Spotify pays 70 percent of its revenue back to the music industry. He said that \\"Thom's issue was that the pipe has become so jammed ... We encourage all of our artists to take a long-term approach ... Plan for the long term, understand that it's a tough game.\\" On 17 June 2016, Radiohead's ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool, was made available on Spotify, six weeks after it was released on paid-for streaming services including Apple Music and Tidal and Deezer Premium APK. Spotify had been in \\"advanced discussions\\" with Radiohead's management and label to make A Moon Shaped Pool the first album available exclusively to Spotify's paid subscribers, but no agreement was reached. Spotify spokesperson Jonathan Prince stated: \\"Some of the approaches we explored with Radiohead were new, and we ultimately decided that we couldn‚Äôt deliver on those approaches technologically in time for the album's release schedule.\\" In Rainbows, the only other Radiohead album not previously available on Spotify, was added on 10 June 2016. Yorke's solo material and Atoms for Peace were re-added in December 2017.  Taylor Swift  Taylor Swift, pictured in 2017, temporarily removed her music from Spotify. In July 2014, Taylor Swift wrote an article in The Wall Street Journal in which she stated: \\"Music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for. It's my opinion that music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's price point is. I hope they don't underestimate themselves or undervalue their art.\\" On 3 November 2014, Swift removed her discography from Spotify. Swift had previously delayed the streaming of her 2012 album Red. Swift stated: \\"I'm not willing to contribute my life's work to an experiment that I don't feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists, and creators of this music. And I just don't agree with perpetuating the perception that music has no value and should be free.\\" Spotify launched a social media campaign to persuade Swift to return and, in a statement on its website, claimed that nearly 16 million of over 40 million users had played her music in the preceding 30-day period. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek wrote: \\"Taylor Swift is absolutely right; music is art, art has real value, and artists deserve to be paid for it. ... At our current size, payouts for a top artist like Taylor Swift (before she pulled her catalog) are on track to exceed $6 million a year.\\" However, Scott Borchetta, CEO of Big Machine Records (Swift's label), disputed those figures, and claimed that Swift had received \\"less than $500,000\\" in the past 12 months of domestic streaming of her songs. A Spotify spokesperson disputed this, telling Time that the total payout for Swift's streaming was $2 million globally. According to Ben Popper of The Verge, Borchetta's figure of $500,000 only covered Spotify's payment for Taylor Swift streams in the US, which is not its largest market. Regarding the $6 million figure, Popper wrote: \\"As more people sign up for Spotify and Taylor Swift continues her march towards infinite popularity, the amount she is getting paid is increasing. [Ek] took her trend line and ran it forward a year to get to the highest possible number he could quote.\\" According to Borchetta, the amount Swift earned from streaming her videos on Vevo was greater than the payout she received from Spotify. He told Time: \\"The facts show that the music industry was much better off before Spotify hit these shores ... Don‚Äôt forget this is for the most successful artist in music today. What about the rest of the artists out there struggling to make a career? Over the last year, what Spotify has paid is the equivalent of less than 50,000 albums sold.\\" Borchetta said in a February 2015 interview that Swift's catalog would be permitted on a streaming service \\"that understands the different needs that we [Swift and Big Machine Records] have,\\" whereby \\"the choice to be [on the free, ad-supported tier] or not\\" is provided. Borchetta argued that Swift's musical oeuvre is \\"arguably the most important current catalog there is\\", and stated that the streaming issue is \\"about each individual artist, and the real mission here is to bring ... attention to it.\\" In November 2014, Borchetta stated in a radio interview that \\"If this fan went and purchased the record, CD, iTunes, wherever, and then their friends go, 'Why did you pay for it? It's free on Spotify', we're being completely disrespectful to that superfan.\\" In December 2015, a bootleg release of Swift's song, \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\", appeared on Spotify credited to Welsh rock band Lostprophets. The release was removed three days later.https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/07/taylor-swift-spotify- lostprophets In an interview with Music Week in November 2016, Spotify's UK head of content programming George Ergatoudis said: \\"I've got every reason to be very optimistic Taylor Swift will be coming back to Spotify. I'm not saying it's done, but the indications are good, put it like that\\". Swift collaborated with Zayn Malik for the song \\"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\\" for the movie Fifty Shades Darker. The song, released in December 2016, was withheld from Spotify for one week after its original release on competing streaming services. In June 2017, it was announced that Swift's full catalog would be released on all streaming services, including Spotify. On social media, Swift's management team stated: \\"In celebration of 1989 selling over 10 million albums worldwide and the RIAA's 100 million song certification, Taylor wants to thank her fans by making her entire back catalog available to all streaming services.\\" Rolling Stone questioned whether the move to allow her music on all streaming services was permanent. On 25 August 2017, Swift released her single \\"Look What You Made Me Do\\"; it was made available on Spotify immediately following release. However, her sixth studio album, Reputation, featuring \\"Look What You Made Me Do\\", was withheld from all streaming services after its 10 November release date, being made available for streaming on 1 December 2017. = Content withdrawals and delays = Spotify states in its support pages that: \\"We want all the world‚Äôs music on Spotify. However, some artists and tracks are not currently available. Sometimes agreements can‚Äôt be reached with the artist or label, or a change may happen in music ownership.\\" Furthermore, in its apps, Spotify states a message for unavailable content: \\"The artist or their representatives have decided not to release this album on Spotify. We are working on it and hope they will change their mind soon.\\" In December 2015, Coldplay withheld A Head Full of Dreams from Spotify until one week after its release, citing that all music on Spotify is available to both paid and free users. Coldplay previously delayed their album Ghost Stories from all streaming services for four months after CD, vinyl and download release, and did the same with its earlier album Mylo Xyloto. Beyonc√©'s self-titled album was not available until 24 November 2014, nearly a year after its original release. Adele's 21 was not initially available on Spotify, as Adele wanted Spotify to make her album available to paid subscribers only, but not to free users. Spotify declined her offer to avoid creating separate catalogues for subscribers and non-subscribers. The album, originally released in January 2011, became available to stream 17 months later in June 2012. In November 2015, the singer confirmed that her new album, 25, wouldn't be available for streaming on any service. In a series of interviews with Time, Adele stated: \\"I know that streaming music is the future, but it‚Äôs not the only way to consume music. ... I can‚Äôt pledge allegiance to something that I don‚Äôt know how I feel about yet.\\" However, the album was made available for streaming seven months later, in June 2016. Several bands from the 1960s and 1970s delayed their work being made available on Spotify or any streaming services. Until the end of 2013, Led Zeppelin's music was not available, before the parties reached an agreement in December. In 2015, AC/DC and The Beatles allowed their music on streaming services. In 2018, many songs from the album Get Happy!! by Elvis Costello and the Attractions were removed from the site, including \\"New Amsterdam\\" and many others. Icelandic singer Bj√∂rk initially chose not to release her album Vulnicura on Spotify, saying: \\"This streaming thing just does not feel right. I don‚Äôt know why, but it just seems insane. ... To work on something for two or three years and then just, 'Oh, here it is for free.' It's not about the money; it‚Äôs about respect, you know? Respect for the craft and the amount of work you put into it.\\" In February 2017, Prince's music produced under the Warner Bros. label, including the albums 1999, Purple Rain, Dirty Mind, and Sign o' the Times, became available on Spotify and other streaming services. In April 2017, rapper Jay Z, part-owner of streaming service Tidal, pulled his music catalog from Spotify and Apple Music. This was the third time the artist removed his albums from competing services, following the release of his debut album Reasonable Doubt, and later The Blueprint. On December 4th, 2019, Jay Z's entire catalogue returne to Spotify after a two year abscene in honour of his 50th birthday. On 2 August 2019, progressive metal band Tool's catalog premiered on Spotify and other digital services for the first time.https://www.spin.com/2019/08/tool-music-listen- streaming-spotify-apple-music-listen Aaliyah, De La Soul, Garth Brooks and Joanna Newsom are some of the few major artists still missing from Spotify.https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7549739/artists-streaming- services-holdout-not-available All of Aaliyah's Blackground Records albums (except for her 1994 debut album Age Ain't Nothing but a Number, which is already available) have never been released digitally because her uncle/manager, Barry Hankerson, has let those releases go out of print. However, on 2 December 2019, Hankerson announced that all of Aaliyah's remaining catalogue will be released on 16 January 2020, which would have been Aaliyah's 41st birthday. However, her last two albums and posthumous releases never appeared.https://thegrio.com/2019/01/16/aaliyah-would-have- turned-40-today-heres-why-we-cant-hear-her-music- onlinehttps://thesource.com/2019/12/02/aaliyah-streaming-platform/ In De La Soul's case, the group did not believe that their label Tommy Boy Records was offering a fair deal.https://fortune.com/2019/02/26/de-la-soul-streaming- tommy-boy Brooks has an exclusive deal with Amazon Music.https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/8498664/garth-brooks- on-amazon-deal-putting-radio-first Meanwhile, Newsom's main catalogue is nowhere to be found on Spotify. She said that the streaming platform is \\"the banana of the music industry\\" and calls it \\"the villainous cabal of major labels\\".https://pitchfork.com/news/61661-joanna-newsom-spotify-is-the-banana- of-the-music-industry-it-just-gives-off-a-fume/ The only song available on Spotify by Newsom is a collaboration she did with The Muppets for their 2011 film of the same name.  Controversial policies and alleged behaviors  = 2015 privacy policy backlash = In August 2015, Spotify changed its privacy policy. The change included the following paragraph: > With your permission, we may collect information stored on your mobile > device, such as contacts, photos, or media files. Local law may require that > you seek the consent of your contacts to provide their personal information > to Spotify, which may use that information for the purposes specified in > this Privacy Policy. Gordon Gottsegen of Wired wrote that the changes were \\"ridiculous\\", and compared Spotify wanting to see and collect users' photos and contacts to that of a \\"jealous ex\\". Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that \\"Apps collecting any personal information like photos or contacts should really have a good explanation of why they need to do so\\" and wrote that \\"Spotify's [privacy policy] is far too broad without examples or vital context and detail around the data gathering the service is implementing\\". On Twitter, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek wrote that \\"[...] I'd argue it's a nice thing that I can upload a photo to my playlist to personalize it.\\" This was followed by an apology on the Spotify blog by Ek, in which he wrote that \\"We should have done a better job in communicating what these policies mean and how any information you choose to share will ‚Äì and will not ‚Äì be used\\", along with details on what features the permissions would enable. An updated privacy policy, with \\"clearer language\\" focused on helping users, rather than lawyers, understand its contents, was rolled out in September 2015. = Pay for Play practice = In August 2015, Billboard reported that Spotify was among the streaming services influenced by \\"pay for play\\", in which labels pay for songs to be placed on popular playlists followed by many users. Daniel Glass, executive of Glassnote Records, stated that playlist promotion was \\"a very, very big deal\\". Billboard referenced an August 5 practice, in which Universal Music Group hired Jay Frank as its Senior Vice President of Global Streaming Marketing, followed by an investment in Frank's marketing firm DigMark, \\"an innovator\\" in pay-for-play practices that charges clients US$2,000 for a six-week campaign. The price goes up for playlists followed by more users, up to US$10,000. \\"For a while, Spotify didn't take a view\\", on the practice, according to a music label executive, but its then-new Terms of Service agreements would \\"[take] a stand against commercializing accounts and playlists by rank-and-file users\\", as well as prohibit the practice of \\"accepting any compensation, financial or otherwise, to influence ... the content included on an account or playlist\\". However, Billboard wrote that \\"policing, let alone enforcing, these terms could be difficult\\", adding that loopholes can still be exploited to continue the practice. In June 2018, allegations resurfaced after the release of Drake's new album Scorpion. According to users the songs of the artist were included in various playlists, some that were unrelated to the genre of their songs, such as gospel, ambient music and \\"best of British\\". Heavy criticism followed, with reports of some paying Spotify subscribers demanding refunds or unsubscribing. One of them reported to call the Federal Trade Commission to report advertising fraud. = 2016‚Äì17: \\"Fake artists\\" controversy = In August 2016, Music Business Worldwide reported that Spotify had begun paying producers to create music and placing the tracks on highly followed and popular playlists on the service. The production of the music, reportedly paid for by Spotify, was published on the service using fake artist names, and the motivation behind the practice reportedly due to creating tracks to \\"quality control\\" the mood of specific playlists and gain more favorable royalty rates than major and independent labels offer. However, the implications of the practice meant certain rightsholders who normally earned decent payouts from being featured on such playlists were excluded. After being mentioned in an article by Vulture in July 2017, a Spotify spokesperson told Billboard that \\"We do not and have never created 'fake' artists and put them on Spotify playlists. Categorically untrue, full stop [...] We pay royalties -- sound and publishing -- for all tracks on Spotify, and for everything we playlist. We do not own rights, we‚Äôre not a label, all our music is licensed from rightsholders and we pay them -- we don‚Äôt pay ourselves\\". However, in another report, the Music Business Worldwide publication discussed the situation, including the artists' lack of social media profiles, lack of managers, lawyers and industry relationships, the listing of owning all their own rights, the lack of appearance on other streaming services, Spotify's denial to comment regarding questions of the artists' frequent placement on playlists, royalty rates and recommendation origins, and anonymous comments from \\"very senior figures in the music business\\" with alleged knowledge of the practice. The publication listed 50 of the top artists under suspicion, and asked them to contact the publication to verify their authenticity, adding that \\"We‚Äôre pretty sure A&R; teams from across the globe would love to hear about artists with no online presence who have managed to rack up millions of Spotify plays with their first few tracks\\". =2017‚Äì18: Hate Content & Hateful Conduct policy= In August 2017, Spotify announced that it would remove music that promotes white nationalism from its catalogue.https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/spotify-removed-white-power-music- platform-still-available-dozens-sites In May 2018, Spotify attracted criticism for its \\"Hate Content & Hateful Conduct policy\\" that removed the music of R. Kelly and XXXTentacion from its editorial and algorithmic playlists because \\"When we look at promotion, we look at issues around hateful conduct, where you have an artist or another creator who has done something off-platform that is so particularly out of line with our values, egregious, in a way that it becomes something that we don't want to associate ourselves with\\". R. Kelly has faced accusations of sexual abuse since the 1990s, being the subject of numerous allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct, often with underage girls, while XXXTentacion was on trial for charges of false imprisonment, witness tampering, and aggravated battery of a pregnant victim. This policy was revoked in June because the company deemed the original wording to be too \\"vague\\"; they stated that \\"Across all genres, our role is not to regulate artists. Therefore, we are moving away from implementing a policy around artist conduct\\". Media scholar, Joey Tan, expressed concern that Spotify had missed an opportunity to stand up against hate speech by revoking the hate speech ban. Tan argued, \\"By connecting listeners to hateful language or promoting artists who have or are alleged to have engaged in hateful behavior, Spotify‚Äîalong with all music distributors‚Äîcontinue to contribute to the circulation and perpetuation of negative, culturally targeted language and behaviors.\\" In April 2019, Spotify completely erased the discography of Blood on the Dance Floor on the grounds of hate content. This happened in the wake of accusations made by nearly two dozen women regarding statutory rape by lead singer Dahvie Vanity.https://dailyiowan.com/2019/04/30/brings-plenty-spotify- removing-controversial-artists-is-important/ While the catalogues of Lostprophets and Gary Glitter are still available on Spotify, it is impossible to create an artist station for Gary Glitter. In 2017, an artist by the name of Uma Kompton released a track by the name of \\"Zayn Did 9/11\\" on her EP \\"Hey Rat\\", a hateful song that alleges that former One Direction member Zayn Malik was the one responsible for the September 11 attacks on the United States, mainly because Zayn is part Pakistani. His fans, known as Zquad, trended the hashtag #RemoveItForZayn on Twitter on July 19th, 2020, about 3 years after the track came out, calling for Spotify and to a lesser extent Apple Music to remove the track.  Security issues   2009 security breach  In March 2009, Spotify warned users that a security flaw discovered and fixed in December 2008 was more serious than previously thought, having compromised the password hashes of individual users in Spotify's pre-December 2008 customer base, as well as potentially \\"registration information such as your email address, birth date, gender, postal code and billing receipt details\\". Credit card information was not exposed, due to being handled by a secure third-party provider. Spotify advised users to change their passwords, especially in cases where the same password was used for multiple sites.  2011 PC malware reports  In March 2011, Spotify temporarily removed display advertising on its computer software, after reports from users on the free service tier that a malicious advertisement had infected their systems. Then-named security firm Websense stated that the attack used the Blackhole exploit kit. Spotify said in a statement that \\"Users with anti-virus software will have been protected\\", and \\"We sincerely apologise to any users affected. We'll continue working hard to ensure this does not happen again and that our users enjoy Spotify securely and in confidence\\".  2014 security breach  In May 2014, Spotify announced it had been hacked, but stated that only one user's information was accessed. It released a new Spotify app on the Android platform, replacing the former app, with Spotify chief technology officer Oskar St√•l writing in a blog post that the upgrade was \\"a necessary precaution\\" and that no action for apps on other platforms were necessary.  Missing or inadequate application features   Lack of explicit content filter  Spotify is one of the few music streaming services that do not allow users to filter explicit content, which Rick Broida of CNET writes \\"may prevent users from opting into Spotify's Family Plan subscription offering\\". However, in April 2018, Spotify added the explicit filter for lyrics to mobile and tablet versions, but still displays explicit album art to all users., BBC News  Limit on music library  Spotify used to limit users' music libraries to 10,000 songs. This caused negative publicity on several occasions and \\"years of user complaints\\". Derek Mead of Motherboard wrote in March 2016 that the limit was \\"insane\\", and suggested that Spotify, after raising \\"another billion dollars\\" in funding, should \\"fix the service's most asinine limitation\\". Chris Welch of The Verge wrote in May 2017 that \\"It‚Äôs time for Spotify to stop capping how much music you can save\\", further questioning \\"Why is there such an arbitrary cap?\\" Welch's article also highlighted the \\"thousands of votes from users\\" on Spotify's community forum asking for a higher limit, and attached a reply from a company representative, stating \\"At the moment, we don‚Äôt have plans to extend the \\"Your Music\\" limit. The reason is because less than 1% of users reach it. The current limit ensures a great experience for 99% of users instead of an \\"OK\\" experience for 100%\\". On May 26, 2020, Spotify relented on their decision and decided to not limit user music libraries to 10,000 songs & albums. The new system only applies to the ability to save songs to your Spotify library. Individual playlists are still limited to 10,000 items, and users can still only download up to 10,000 songs on each of their five different devices for offline listening.https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270409/spotify-song-library- limit-removed-music-downloads-playlists-feature  Other criticism   \\"Scorpion SZN\\" promotion  On June 27, 2018, Spotify held a \\"takeover\\" promotion (dubbed \\"Scorpion SZN\\") to promote the release of Drake's fifth studio album Scorpion. During the promotion, many of the service's curated playlists had their cover art modified to include photos of Drake, even if the playlist's topic was not associated with Drake's music. The campaign faced criticism from some users, who felt that it was excessive (especially to users not necessarily interested in Drake's music), and contradictory to Spotify Premium being promoted as an ad-free service. It was reported that some users had successfully received refunds after complaining about the promotion.  Ministry of Sound copyright lawsuit  In September 2013, Ministry of Sound sued Spotify, alleging that user playlists mimicking the track listings of their compilation albums were infringing on the copyrights of the albums themselves (citing the skill and effort in their compilation). In 2014, the two parties reached a settlement, under which Spotify agreed to restrict the ability to search for or follow the infringing playlists.

Education Aman graduated from Duke University with honors in 1988 with a bachelor's degree in public policy and history. He went on to attend the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1994, where he earned a Master of Business Administration with distinction. Career A former partner at the Atlanta office of the consulting firm Bain and Company, Aman worked pro bono for Shirley Franklin, the then-mayor of Atlanta, in the 2000s. Initially signing up to do several months of work, Bain ended up giving the city three years of Aman's time.

He is remembered for his social connections with William Wordsworth in the early 1790s. Earlier life Nicholson was born on 4 September 1738, the son of George Nicholson, and grandson of the nonconformist minister George Nicholson (1636‚Äì1690) of Kirkoswald, Cumberland. He was in business in London as a wholesale haberdasher, in Cateaton Street. His warehouse was adjacent to his home. In the 1780s, Nicholson was a member of the Society for Constitutional Information. Relationship with Wordsworth Wordsworth met Nicholson through a family connection, Elizabeth Threlkeld, who had been Dorothy Wordsworth's foster mother (1778‚Äì1787) in Halifax, Yorkshire. Elizabeth married William Rawson in 1791; they were both Unitarians. They moved to London from Halifax, knew Nicholson, and introduced William to him. The period when Wordsworth dined regularly with Nicholson has tentatively been placed in spring of 1793. They went together to hear Joseph Fawcett preach. Nicholas Roe has suggested that Wordsworth's further engagement with radical English reformers may trace back to his connection with Nicholson. It has been inferred, by Roe, that Nicholson probably introduced Wordsworth to Joseph Johnson the publisher. Keay places Wordsworth's own radical beliefs in the context of a period 1793‚Äì5 and contact with the views and milieu of the Society of Constitutional Information, to which Johnson also belonged: the Norman Yoke, and the Tory Bolingbroke's arguments on capital and corruption. Nicholson, in any case, is credited with Wordsworth's introduction into the London group of radical dissenters, including William Godwin. They played a significant part in his thinking, until the middle of 1795. \\"Mr Nicholson\\" was referenced in the notes to The Excursion. Later life Nicholson was a founding partner of the Glasgow Bank in 1809. He acted as trustee of Dr Williams's Library from 1815 to 1827. He died on 26 October 1827, at Ham Common. In the last year of his life he had donated to the orphan school on City Road. Family Nicholson married Mary Haydon. Their eldest daughter Caroline married in 1804 Thomas Hockin Kingdon, Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford. Harriet, the fourth daughter, married John Vowler of Parnacott in 1817. The only son of the marriage was George Thomas Nicholson. He studied at Manchester Academy from 1803 to 1805. In 1806 he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1809. That year he entered the Inner Temple. He became a barrister, and was President of the National Life Assurance Society; it was founded in 1829, was a mutual insurance company from 1847, and merged with the Mutual Life Assurance Society in 1896 to form The National Mutual Life Assurance Society.ReAssure, Principles and Practices of Financial Management (PDF) at p.4.

He was High Sheriff of Surrey in 1833, and was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society in 1835. Nicholson married Anne Elizabeth Smith, daughter of William Smith.

Two years later, under his leadership, a Biographie parlementaire des repr√©sentants du peuple √† l'Assembl√©e nationale constituante de 1848, written by a \\"society of publicists and men of letters\\" was published, where we meet his friends √âtienne Arago and Louis Lurine. Along with other writers and publicists, he participated in collections of collective texts, including Paris r√©volutionnaire, foyer de lumi√®res et d'insurrection (6 vol., 1833‚Äì1834), Nouveau tableau de Paris au XIXe (1834‚Äì1835) as well as Paris historique, pittoresque et anecdotique (Le Luxembourg, vol.7, 1855).  As dramatist  He created for the stage many plays (more than forty) in the taste of the time: com√©dies en vaudeville, dramas, melodramas, reviews and variety scenes, written almost always in collaboration and signed by his first names (Philadelphe or Philadelphe- Maurice) or under various pseudonymes (Depontchartrain or de Pontchartrain, Saint-Gervais or \\"the[H]ermit of Luxembourg\\"). Some titles from the repertoire will give an idea of it: L'agent de change ou Une fin de mois, 3-act drama imitated from Beaumarchais (1825), La Vogue, big show vaudeville (1825), Bergami et la reine d'Angleterre, drama in 5 acts (1833), ' (1834), a review in 15 deliveries. Some of these texts can be found in Le Magasin th√©√¢tral, choix de pi√®ces nouvelles jou√©es sur tous les th√©√¢tres de Paris de 1834 √† 1839 (25 bands in 13 volumes, see on Gallica). His knowledge of the world of the stage and its protagonists is reflected very early on in the publication of the Dictionnaire th√©√¢tral (according to the subtitle \\"twelve hundred and thirty-three truths about the directors, directors, actors, actresses and employees of the various theatres.\\"), written in collaboration with Charles Jean Harel and Auguste Jal 1st ed. 1824, see on Gallica); One year later, he published the Grande biographie dramatique, ou Silhouette des acteurs, actrices, chanteurs, cantatrices, danseurs, danseuses... (1825) which he signed under his pseudonym L'Ermite du Luxembourg. The article \\"Vari√©t√©s\\" of the Dictionnaire th√©√¢tral √† propos aptly puts the interest of this form of entertainment: \\"The most advantageous situation, a charming room and a rare collection of varied talents may have done even less for the prosperity of this theatre than the license and tone of the works whose repertoire is uniformly composed\\".Dictionnaire th√©√¢tral, (pp. 297).  Other publications  In parallel to his theatrical activity, he wrote in a comic or humorous register that does not take us far from the scene of the accompanying texts for illustrated albums: Les Cent et un Robert Macaire (with Louis Huart, drawings by Daumier, 1839) and Le Mus√©e pour rire, dessins par tous les caricaturistes de Paris (with Louis Huart and Charles Philipon, 1839‚Äì1840). He is also the author of several \\"Physiologies\\", then very much in vogue: that of the traveller (ill. by Daumier and Ange-Louis Janet-Lange, 1841), the lorette (whores) (ill. by Gavarni, 1841), the longshoreman (ill. by Gavarni, 1842), the creditor and debtor (ill. by Janet-Lange, 1842). We also owe him Les Fleurs historiques (with Jules Rostaing, 1852) and Les M√©moires de Bilboquet, recueillis par un bourgeois de Paris (with Taxile Delord and Edmond Texier, 1854). In 1836, with Jacques-Germain Chaudes-Aigues (under the pseudonym \\"Jacques de Chaudesaigues\\"), he had a novel entitled Sous le froc, le chartreux published, inspired by a stay of several months at the La Trappe Abbey monastery.

It is the sequel to There's Always a Woman, released the same year. In both films, Melvyn Douglas stars as a private investigator whose wife involves herself in his work. Joan Blondell played the wife in the first film, but that role went to Virginia Bruce in this one. Plot Private detective Bill Reardon (Melvyn Douglas) is awakened one morning by his dizzy wife, Sally (Virginia Bruce), who can't remember what the string tied to her finger is supposed to remind her of. While discussing the unfortunate financial condition of their private detective agency during breakfast, an executive of a jewelry story, Mr. Stone (Reardon's only client) calls him and demands to know why he hasn't shown up for an important meeting to discuss the recent robberies the store has experienced. Sally Reardon was supposed to give her husband a message about the meeting (which explains the string on her finger). Reardon hurries off to meet with Mr. Stone and Mr. Davis (the jewelry store executives), along with Mrs. Nacelle (the wife of the rich owner of the store). Reardon informs them that he has a solid suspect for the crimes, a clerk named Charles Crenshaw (Gordon Oliver). Meanwhile, Charles Crenshaw shows up at the Reardon Detective agency and wants to hire them to find out why he's being followed by an unknown man who recently searched his apartment. Sally Reardon pretends to be one of the agency's detectives, hoping to help her husband's failing business. She accepts Crenshaw's case. Crenshaw is unaware that the man who followed him and searched is apartment was actually Bill Reardon himself, since he thinks Crenshaw is the thief. That afternoon, Bill Reardon has lunch with the attractive Mrs. Nacelle (Margaret Lindsay), who informs him that her husband took over the jewelry store from Mr. Davis because he owed her husband money. Mrs. Nacelle thinks Davis resents losing the store, and she suggests that he might be the thief. Sally Reardon shows up at the restaurant and overhears her husband say that Charles Crenshaw (the agency's newest client) is also the chief suspect for the jewel thefts! Believing Crenshaw is innocent, Sally quickly leaves the restaurant so she can call the young clerk at the jewelry store and warn him. Soon afterwards, Bill Reardon and his agents apprehend Crenshaw. That evening the Reardon's join Mr. and Mrs. Nacelle for dinner at a posh nightclub. The jewelry store's manager and former owner (Davis) is seen leaving the nightclub, and he deliberated picks up a note at the hat check stand which was left for Tony Croy (Stanley Ridges), a known mob boss. Moments later Tony Croy arrives and asks the hat check girl if there's a note for him, but the girl says it was just picked up by another man who claimed to be Mr. Croy. Davis leaves in a cab, and Croy jumps into a cab to follow him. In the cab, Davis reads the note he stole, which gives the location of some unnamed object located in a specific filing cabinet at the jewelry store. Davis goes to the jewelry store to find out what the note refers to, but he's shot by an unseen assailant. Meanwhile, back at the nightclub, Sally devises a harebrained scheme to help clear Crenshaw of the robberies by stealing something from the jewelry store while Crenshaw is still in jail, which would prove he was not the culprit. Using the keys she takes from Mrs. Nacelle's purse, she goes to the jewelry store and steals several items from a display case. The next morning at the crime scene, the police detectives are busy collecting evidence. Bill Reardon secretly finds the note that Davis brought to the store the night before, and Reardon realizes that it's connected to the case. Bill and Sally Reardon eventually discover that Tony Croy and Mrs. Nacelle were married some years earlier, but never got divorced. Croy has been blackmailing Mrs. Nacelle with this info, forcing her to steal the jewelry from her husband's store. When Croy comes to Mrs. Nacelles mansion to collect the stolen jewels, Mrs. Nacelle tricks him by having him open a safe which is rigged to fire a gun attached to a device inside. Back at the jewelry store, Bill shows the police detectives that Mr. Davis was actually killed by a trick gun which fired from inside the file drawer when it was opened ‚Äî the same trick Mrs. Nacelle used inside her home wall safe. The rigged filling cabinet drawer was meant to kill Croy, the man who was supposed to get the note which gave directions to that particular file drawer. Bill and Sally Reardon set a trap for Mrs. Nacelle, solve the case, and lead the police to the final showdown with the murderous wife.

It was first collected from Hong Kong by A.W. Herre in 1936. The introduction of mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) and habitat destruction caused the extirpation of this species from Hong Kong and the species was considered to be extinct in the wild. However, a similar species Aphyocypris pulchrilineata was discovered in Guangxi in southern China, but this species lacks the dark spot on the base of the caudal fin. Description Aphyocypris lini is a small fish which has a yellowish-brown body with a bluish back and a white underside which are separated by a series of parallel stripes with the middle stripe being reddish-yellow, a bluish black stripe above and an iridescent green line below it. There is a large blue spot, edged with gold at the base of the caudal fin while the fins are white. It has pelvic scutes which run from the base of the pelvic fin to the anus. There is no lateral line but there are 30‚Äì32 scales along lateral axis. Adults grow to 50 mm total length. It has three spines and seven soft rays in the dorsal fin with three spines and eight soft rayes in the anal fin. Distribution This species is endemic to southern China and it was first recorded in Fanling in the New Territories of Hong Kong in 1939, and was found in the Tai Mo Shan area in 1992, but since then there have been no records in the wild. Habitat Aphyocypris lini is a benthopelagic fish species which lives ditches and rivers where there is clear, shallow water with dense aquatic vegetation. Spawning occurs in open water with sandy and gravel substrates. Conservation The decline In the wild populations of Aphyocypris lini is thought to be due to habitat destruction by human development such as the construction of hydroelectric projects, water pollution and deforestation. They were possibly also affected by competition from introduced fish species such as the mosquitofish. The only currently known population of the garnet minnow are in captive breeding facilities in Hong Kong, Macau and some other southeastern Asia countries where they are bred for export in the aquarium trade. It is possible that the species could be reintroduced to the wild using captive bred fish after habitat restoration and the removal of invasive alien competitors.

The chief Maratha houses, Gaikwar and Peshwa had made peace with each other and driven out the Mughal nobles under the emperor Alamgir II. One such noble, Momin Khan, had countered their advances and recovered Ahmedabad in 1756 lost to the Marathas few years ago. After a long siege, Ahmedabad fell again in hands of the Marathas. The Marathas levied tributes across Gujarat. In 1759, the English of the British East India Company captured Surat. Sadashiv Ramchandra was appointed as a viceroy by Peshwa in 1760 followed by Apa Ganesh in 1761. Following defeat of Marathas in the Third Battle of Panipat (1761), the nobles briefly recovered towns from the Marathas but soon had to surrender. Thus the Marathas firmly established themselves in Gujarat. Gujarat under Alamgir II (1754‚Äì1759) At Delhi, during 1754, the emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur was deposed, and √Çz√≠z-ud-d√≠n, son of Jah√°nd√°r Sh√°h, was raised to the throne with the title of Alamgir II. Maratha leader Bhagvantr√°v who was held captive was released and he established himself in the Cambay fort of N√°p√°d and not long after began to attack Mughal noble Mom√≠n Kh√°n's villages. ;Contest with Mom√≠n Kh√°n Renewed, 1754 After several doubtful engagements peace was concluded on Mom√≠n Kh√°n paying Rupees 10,000 on account of the usual share of the Mar√°th√°s which he had withheld. This arrangement was made through the mediation of Tuk√°ji, the steward of Sad√°shiv D√°modar, who had come to Gujar√°t with an army and orders to help Bhagvantr√°v. As Mom√≠n Kh√°n had no ready money Tuk√°ji offered himself as security and Bhagvantr√°v and Tuk√°ji withdrew to the Dakhan. Mom√≠n Kh√°n's soldiery now clamoured for pay. As he was not in a position to meet their demands he sent a body of men against some villages to the west belonging to Limbdi and plundered them, dividing the booty among his troops. In the following year, 1755, Mom√≠n Kh√°n went to Ghogha, a port which, though at one time subordinate to Cambay (Khambhat), had fallen into the hands of Sher Kh√°n B√°bi, and was now in the possession of the Peshwa's officers. Ghogha fell and leaving a garrison of 100 Arabs under Ibr√°h√≠m K√∫li Kh√°n, Mom√≠n Kh√°n returned to Cambay, levying tribute. He then sent the bulk of his army under the command of Muhammad Zam√°n Kh√°n, son of Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n, and Varajl√°l his own steward, to plunder and collect money in Gohilwad and Kathiawad. Here they remained until their arrears were paid off, and then returned to Cambay. After this Mom√≠n Kh√°n plundered several Petlad villages and finally, in concert with the Kolis of Dhowan, attacked Jambusar and carried off much booty. Mom√≠n Kh√°n next marched against Borsad, and was on the point of taking the fort when Say√°ji, son of D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r, who lived at Baroda, hearing of Mom√≠n Kh√°n's success, came rapidly with a small body of men to the relief of the fort and surprised the besiegers. Momin Khan's troops soon recovered from the effects of the surprise, and Say√°ji fearing to engage them with so small a force retired. On Say√°ji's departure, Mom√≠n Kh√°n raised the siege of Borsad and returned to Cambay. ;Mom√≠n Kh√°n recovers √Åhmed√°b√°d, 1756 In 1756, the rains were very heavy, and the walls of √Åhmed√°b√°d fell in many places. Mom√≠n Kh√°n, hearing of this as well as of the discontent of the inhabitants, resolved to capture the city. He sent spies to ascertain the strength of the garrison and set about making allies of the chief men in the province and enlisting troops. About this time R√°ghoji, the Mar√°tha deputy, was assassinated by a Rohilla. As soon as Mom√≠n Kh√°n heard of R√°ghoji's death he sent his nephew, Muhammad Zam√°n Kh√°n, with some men in advance, and afterwards himself at the close of the year, 1756, marched from Cambay and camped on the Vatrak river. From this camp they moved to Kaira (Kheda), and from Kaira to √Åhmed√°b√°d. After one or two fights in the suburbs, the Momin Khan's troop, finding their way through the breaches in the walls, opened the gates and entered the town. The Kolis commenced plundering, and a hand-to-hand fight ensued, in which the Mar√°th√°s were worsted and were eventually expelled from the city. The Kolis attempted to plunder the Dutch factory, but met with a resistance, and when Shambh√∫r√°m, a N√°gar Br√°hman, one of Mom√≠n Kh√°n's chief supporters, heard it he ordered the Kolis to cease attacking the factory and consoled the Dutch. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, who had previously surrendered Ahmedabad to the Marathas and retired, had been invited by the Mar√°th√°s to their assistance, set out from Patan, and when he arrived at Pethapur and M√°nsa he heard of the capture of √Åhmed√°b√°d. On reaching Kalol, he was joined by Harbhamr√°m, governor of Kadi. They resolved to send Zor√°war Kh√°n B√°bi to recall Sad√°shiv D√°modar, and to await his arrival at V√≠ramg√°m. Shevakr√°m, the G√°ikw√°r's deputy, had taken refuge at Dholka. Mom√≠n Kh√°n himself now advanced, and entering √Åhmed√°b√°d on the 17 October 1756, appointed Shambh√∫r√°m his deputy. Sad√°shiv D√°modar now joined Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n at Viramgam, and at Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n's advice it was resolved, before taking further steps, to write to the Peshwa for aid. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, although he held large service estates, charged the Mar√°th√°s Rupees 1500 a day for his troops. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n and the Mar√°th√°s then advanced to Sanand and Jitalpur, and thence marched towards Cambay. On their way they were met, and, after several combats, defeated by a detachment of Mom√≠n Kh√°n's army. Mom√≠n Kh√°n sent troops to overrun Kadi, but Harbhamr√°m, the governor of Kadi, defeated the force, and captured their guns. When the emperor heard of the capture of Ghogha, he sent a sword as a present to Mom√≠n Kh√°n; and when the news of the capture of √Åhmed√°b√°d reached Agra, Mom√≠n Kh√°n received many compliments. B√°l√°jir√°v Peshwa on the other hand was greatly enraged at these reverses. He at once sent off Sad√°shiv R√°mchandra to Gujar√°t as his deputy, and D√°m√°ji and Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r also accompanied him with their forces. Mom√≠n Kh√°n refusing to give up √Åhmed√°b√°d, prepared for defense. Sad√°shiv R√°mchandra, D√°m√°ji and Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r advanced, and, crossing the Mahi river, reached Kaira. Here they were met by Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n and the rest of the Mar√°tha forces in Gujar√°t, and the combined army advancing against the capital camped by the Kankaria Lake. The Mar√°th√°s now regularly invested the city, but Mom√≠n Kh√°n, aided by Shambh√∫r√°m, made a vigorous defence. Up to this time Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n was receiving Rupees 1500 daily for the pay of his own and his brother's troops. Sad√°shiv R√°mchandra, considering the number of the troops too small for so large a payment, reduced the amount and retained the men in his own service. After a month's siege, Mom√≠n Kh√°n's troops began to clamour for pay, but Shambh√∫r√°m, by collecting the sum of Rupees 1 l√°kh from the inhabitants of the town managed for the time to appease their demands. When they again became urgent for pay, Shambh√∫r√°m diverted their thoughts by a general sally from all the gates at night. On this occasion many men were slain on both sides, and many of the inhabitants deserted the town. The copper vessels of such of the townspeople as had fled were melted and coined into money and given to the soldiery. In this state of affairs an order arrived from the imperial court bestowing on Mom√≠n Kh√°n a dress of honour and the title of Bah√°dur. Although the imperial power had for years been merely a name Mom√≠n Kh√°n asked and obtained permission from the besiegers to leave the city and meet the bearers of the order. The Mar√°th√°s redoubled their efforts. Still though the besiegers were successful in intercepting supplies of grain the garrison fought gallantly in defense of the town. At this juncture, in 1757, R√°ja Shivsingh of √çdar, son of the late Anandsingh, who was friendly to Mom√≠n Kh√°n, sent Saj√°nsingh Haz√°ri with a force to assist the besieged. On their way to √Åhmed√°b√°d, Harbhamr√°m with a body of Mar√°th√°s attacked this detachment, while Mom√≠n Kh√°n sent to their aid Muhammad L√°l Rohilla and others, and a doubtful battle was fought. Shortly afterwards Sad√°shiv R√°mchandar made an attempt on the fort of K√°likot. The fort was successfully defended by Jam√°d√°r N√∫r Muhammad, and the Mar√°th√°s were repulsed. The Mar√°th√°s endeavoured in vain to persuade Shambh√∫r√°m to desert Mom√≠n Kh√°n, and though the garrison were often endangered by the faithlessness of the Kolis and other causes, they remained staunch. Mom√≠n Kh√°n, though frequently in difficulties owing to want of funds to pay his soldiery, continued to defend the town. The Mar√°th√°s next tried to seduce some of Mom√≠n Kh√°n's officers, but in this they also failed, and in a sally Shambh√∫r√°m attacked the camp of Sad√°shiv R√°mchandar, and burning his tents all but captured the chief himself. When the siege was at this stage, Hassan K√∫li Kh√°n Bah√°dur, viceroy of Oudh, relinquishing worldly affairs and dividing his property among his nephews, set out to perform a pilgrimage to Mecca. Before he started Shuja-ud-Daula, the Naw√°b of Lucknow, requested him on his way to visit B√°l√°jir√°v, and endeavour to come to some settlement of √Åhmed√°b√°d affairs. Accordingly, adopting the name of Sh√°h N√∫r, and assuming the dress of an ascetic, Hassan K√∫li made his way to Poona, and appearing before the Peshwa offered to make peace at √Åhmed√°b√°d. Sh√°h N√∫r with much difficulty persuaded the Peshwa to allow Mom√≠n Kh√°n to retain Cambay and Ghogha without any Mar√°tha share, and to grant him a l√°kh of rupees for the payment of his troops, on condition that he should surrender √Åhmed√°b√°d. He obtained letters from the Peshwa addressed to Sad√°shiv R√°mchandra to this effect, and set out with them for √Åhmed√°b√°d. When he arrived Sad√°shiv R√°mchandra was unwilling to accede to the terms, as the √Åhmed√°b√°d garrison were reduced to great straits. Sh√°h N√∫r persuaded him at last to agree, provided Mom√≠n Kh√°n would surrender without delay. Accordingly, Sh√°h N√∫r entered the city and endeavoured to persuade Mom√≠n Kh√°n. Mom√≠n Kh√°n demanded in addition a few Petl√°d villages, and to this the Mar√°th√°s refused their consent. Sh√°h N√∫r left in disgust. Before many days Mom√≠n Kh√°n was forced to make overtures for peace. After discussions with D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r, it was agreed that Mom√≠n Kh√°n should surrender the city, receive Rupees 1 l√°kh to pay his soldiery, and be allowed to retain Cambay as heretofore, that is to say that the Peshwa should, as formerly, enjoy half the revenues. In addition to this Mom√≠n Kh√°n had to promise to pay the Mar√°th√°s a yearly tribute of Rupees 10,000 and to give up all claims on the town of Ghogha and hand over Shambh√∫r√°m to the Mar√°th√°s. It was also arranged that the Rupees 35,000 worth of ashrafis which he had taken through Jam√°d√°r S√°lim should be deducted from the Rupees 1 l√°kh. Mom√≠n Kh√°n surrendered the town on 27 February 1758. Sad√°shiv R√°mchandar and D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r entered the city and undertook its management on behalf of the Mar√°th√°s. Of the other chiefs who were engaged in prosecuting the siege, Sad√°shiv D√°modar returned to the Dakhan (Deccan) and Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n receiving some presents from Sad√°shiv R√°mchandar departed for P√°tan after having had a meeting with D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r at a village a few miles from the capital. Shambhur√°m, the N√°gar Br√°hman, who had so zealously supported Mom√≠n Kh√°n, when he saw that further assistance was useless, tried to escape, but was taken prisoner and sent in chains to Baroda. Sad√°shiv R√°mchandar, on taking charge of the city, had interviews with the principal officials, among whom was the author of the MirƒÉt-i-√Åhmedi, and, receiving them graciously, confirmed most of them in their offices. Then, after choosing N√°ro Pandit, brother of P√°ndurang Pandit, to be his deputy in √Åhmed√°b√°d, he started on an expedition to collect tribute in Jhalawad and Sorath. On receiving the government of the city the Mar√°tha generals ordered new coin bearing the mark of an elephant goad to be struck in the √Åhmed√°b√°d mint. Say√°jir√°v G√°ikw√°r remained in √Åhmed√°b√°d on behalf of his father D√°m√°ji, and shortly afterwards went towards Kapadvanj to collect tribute. Thence at his father's request he proceeded to Sorath to arrange for the payment of the G√°ikw√°r's share of the revenues of that district. On his return to Cambay, Mom√≠n Kh√°n was much harassed by his troops for arrears of pay. The timely arrival of his steward Varajl√°l with the Peshwa's contribution of Rupees 1 l√°kh enabled him to satisfy their demands. Mom√≠n Kh√°n now began to oppress and extort money from his own followers, and is said to have instigated the murder of his steward Varajl√°l. Sad√°shiv R√°mchandar went from Porbandar to Junagadh, where he was joined by Say√°jir√°v G√°ikw√°r. At Jun√°ga·∏çh, Sher Kh√°n B√°bi presented Sad√°shiv R√°mchandra and Siy√°jir√°v with horses and they spoke of the necessity of admitting a Mar√°tha deputy into Jun√°ga·∏çh. Nothing was settled as the Mar√°th√°s were forced to return to √Åhmed√°b√°d. In accordance with orders from the Peshwa, Shambhur√°m and his sons, who were still in confinement, were sent to Poona. D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r was also summoned to Poona, but he did not go. ;Expedition from Kutch against Sindh, 1758 In this year R√°o Lakhpatji of Kutch presented Kutchi horses and Gujar√°t bullocks to the emperor Alamgir II, and in return received the title of M√≠rza R√°ja. About this time the R√°o of Kutch, who planned an expedition against Sindh, solicited aid both from D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r and Sad√°shiv R√°mchandar to enable him to conquer Thatta, and, as he agreed to pay expenses, Sad√°shiv sent Ranchord√°s, and D√°m√°ji sent Shevakr√°m to help him. In this year also Nekn√°m Kh√°n, governor of Bharuch, received the title of Bah√°dur and other honours. In 1758, Sad√°shiv R√°mchandar advanced to Kaira and after settling accounts with D√°m√°ji's agent proceeded against Cambay. Mom√≠n Kh√°n, who was about to visit the Peshwa at Poona, remained to defend the town, but was forced to pay arrears of tribute amounting to ¬£2000 (Rs. 20,000). In this year Sher Kh√°n B√°bi died at Jun√°ga·∏çh, and the nobles of his court seated his son Muhammad Mah√°bat Kh√°n in his place. Shortly after at the invitation of the Peshwa, D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r went to Poona, and sent his son Say√°jir√°v into Sorath. After his success at Cambay Sad√°shiv R√°mchandra levied tribute from the chiefs of Umeta, and then returned. On his way back, on account of the opposition caused by Sard√°r Muhammad Kh√°n son of Sher Kh√°n B√°bi, the chief of Balasinor, Sad√°shiv R√°mchandar besieged B√°l√°sinor and forced the chief to pay Rupees 30,000. Next marching against Lunavada, he compelled the chief D√≠psingh to pay ¬£5000 (Rs. 50,000). Sad√°shiv then went to Visnagar and so to Palanpur, where Muhammad Kh√°n Bah√°dur Jh√°lori resisted him; but after a month's siege he agreed to pay a tribute of Rupees 35,000. Passing south from P√°lanpur, Sad√°shiv went to Unjha-Un√°va, and from that to Katosan where he levied Rupees 10,000 from the chief Shuja, and then proceeded to Limbdi.  Surat Affairs, 1758  In the early part of 1758, Sayad Mu√Æn-ud-d√≠n, otherwise called Sayad Achchan, visited the Peshwa at Poona, and received from him the appointment of governor of Surat. Sayad Achchan then set out for his charge, and as he was aided by a body of Mar√°tha troops under the command of Muzaffar Kh√°n G√°rdi and had also secured the support of Nekn√°m Kh√°n, the governor of Bharuch, he succeeded after some resistance in expelling √Åli Naw√°z Kh√°n, son of the late Safdar Muhammad Kh√°n, and establishing himself in the government. During the recent troubles, the English factory had been plundered and two of their clerks murdered by Ahmed Kh√°n Habshi, commandant of the fort. ;The English take command of Surat, 1759. The English therefore determined to drive out the Habshi and themselves assume the government of the Surat Castle. With this object men-of-war were despatched from Bombay to the help of Mr. Spencer, the chief of the English factory, and the castle was taken in March 1759, and Mr. Spencer appointed governor. The Peshwa appears to have consented to this conquest. The Mar√°tha troops aided and made a demonstration without the city, and a Mar√°tha man-of-war which had been stationed at Bassein (Vasai), came to assist the English. A Mr. Glass appears to have been appointed kiled√°r under Governor Spencer. Shortly afterwards Mom√≠n Kh√°n, by the advice of Sayad Husain, an agent of the Peshwa, contracted friendship with the English through Mr. Erskine, the chief of the English factory at Cambay. Mom√≠n Kh√°n then asked Mr. Erskine to obtain permission for him to go to Poona by Bombay. Leave being granted, Mom√≠n Kh√°n set out for Surat, and was there received by Mr. Spencer. From Surat he sailed for Bombay, where the governor, Mr. Bourchier, informed the Peshwa of his arrival. The Peshwa sending permission for his further advance to Poona, Mom√≠n Kh√°n took leave of Mr. Bourchier and proceeded to Poona. Maratha viceroys Sad√°shiv R√°mchandra, Peshwa‚Äôs Viceroy, 1760 ;The Mar√°th√°s in Kathiawad, 1759 From Limb·∏çi, to which point his tribute tour has been traced, Sad√°shiv R√°mchandra advanced against Dhrangadhra, when the chief who was at Halvad sent an army against him. The Mar√°th√°s, informed of the chief's design, detaching a force, attacked Halvad at night, and breaching the walls forced open the gates. The chief retired to his palace, which was fortified, and there defended himself, but was at last forced to surrender, and was detained a prisoner until he should pay a sum of Rupees 1,20,000. The neighbouring chiefs, impressed with the fate of Halvad, paid tribute without opposition. Sad√°shiv R√°mchandra now went to Jun√°ga·∏çh, but ere he could commence operations against the fortress, the rainy season drew near, and returning to √Åhmed√°b√°d he prepared to depart for Poona. Say√°ji G√°ikw√°r, who was also in Sorath collecting tribute, amongst other places besieged Kundla, and levying from that town a tribute of Rupees 75,000 returned to the capital. During this time Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r had been levying tribute from the Kolis, and after visiting the Bh√≠l district went to Vijapur, Idar, Kadi, Dholka, and Nadiad. The chief of Halvad on paying his Rupees 1,20,000 was allowed to depart, and D√≠psingh of Lun√°v√°·∏ça, who was also a prisoner, was sent to Lun√°v√°·∏ça and there released after paying his tribute. On receiving the news of the capture of the Surat fort by the English the emperor Alamgir II issued an order, in the name of the governor of Bombay, confirming the command of the fort to the English instead of to the Habshis of Janjira, appointing the East India Company admirals of the imperial fleet, and at the same time discontinuing the yearly payment of Rupees 20,000 formerly made to the Habshi on this account. When in 1760, this imperial order reached Surat, Mr. Spencer and other chief men of the city went outside of the walls to meet and escort the bearers of the despatch. Sad√°shiv R√°mchandra was appointed viceroy of √Åhmed√°b√°d on behalf of the Peshwa. Bhagvantr√°v now conquered B√°l√°sinor from Sard√°r Muhammad Kh√°n B√°bi, and then marching to Sorath, collected the Peshwa's share of the tribute of that province, according to the scale of the previous year. Say√°ji G√°ikw√°r, when Bhagvantr√°v had returned, set out to Sorath to levy the G√°ikw√°r's share of the tribute. He was accompanied by Harbhamr√°m whom D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r had specially sent from his own court to act as K√°md√°r to Say√°ji. When Sad√°shiv R√°mchandra reported to the Peshwa the conquest of B√°l√°sinor by Bhagvantr√°v he was highly pleased, and gave Bhagvantr√°v a dress of honour and allowed him to keep the elephant which he had captured at Lun√°v√°·∏ça; and passed a patent bestowing B√°l√°sinor upon him. Mom√≠n Kh√°n, after making firm promises to the Peshwa never to depart from the terms of the treaty he had made with the Mar√°th√°s, left Poona and came to Bombay, where he was courteously entertained by the Governor, and despatched by boat to Surat. From Surat he passed to Cambay by land through Broach. Say√°ji G√°ikw√°r had returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d from Sorath in bad health, and his uncle Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r, who had been vainly endeavouring to subdue the Kolis of L√∫h√°ra, came to √Åhmed√°b√°d and took Say√°ji G√°ikw√°r to Na·∏çi√°d. √Åpa Ganesh, Viceroy, 1761 In 1761, Sad√°shiv R√°mchandra was displaced as viceroy of Gujar√°t by √Åpa Ganesh. This officer acted in a friendly manner to Mom√≠n Kh√°n, and marching to Cambay, he fixed the Mar√°tha share of the revenues of that place for that year at Rupees 84,000, and then went to √Åhmed√°b√°d by way of Dakor. Narbher√°m collected this year the G√°ikw√°r's share of the tribute of Sorath and Say√°ji G√°ikw√°r went to Baroda. On his return to √Åhmed√°b√°d at the end of the year, Say√°ji sacked and burned the Koli village of L√∫h√°ra in Bahyal about eighteen miles east of √Åhmed√°b√°d. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n now issued from P√°tan and levied small contributions from the holdings in Vagad, as far as Anjar in Kutch. From V√°gad he proceeded to Sorath, and in concert with Muhammad Mah√°bat Kh√°n of Jun√°ga·∏çh and Muhammad Muz√°ffar Kh√°n B√°bi, between whom he made peace, he levied tribute in Sorath as far as Loliyana, and returned to P√°tan. ;1761 The Marathas were defeated by Afghan forces in the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). Taking advantage of the confusion that followed, the Delhi court despatched instructions to the chief Mughal nobles of Gujar√°t, directing Mom√≠n Kh√°n, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, and the governor of Bharuch to join in driving the Mar√°th√°s out of the province. In consequence of this despatch, Sard√°r Muhammad Kh√°n B√°bi, defeating the Mar√°tha garrison, regained B√°l√°sinor, while the governor of Bharuch, with the aid of Mom√≠n Kh√°n, succeeded in winning back Jamb√∫sar. √Åpa Ganesh, the Peshwa's viceroy, remonstrated with Mom√≠n Kh√°n for this breach of faith. In reply his envoy was shown the despatch received from Delhi, and was made the bearer of a message, that before it was too late, it would be wisdom for the Mar√°th√°s to abandon Gujar√°t. Things were in this state when D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r, wisely forgetting his quarrels with the Peshwa, marched to the aid of Sad√°shiv with a large army. Advancing against Cambay he attacked and defeated Mom√≠n Kh√°n, plundering one of his villages. But the Mar√°th√°s were too weak to follow up this success, or exact severer punishment from the Mughal confederates. √Åpa Ganesh invited Sard√°r Muhammad Kh√°n B√°bi to Kaira, and on condition of the payment of tribute, agreed to allow him to keep possession of B√°l√°sinor. Subsequently, D√°m√°ji's energy enabled him to enlarge the power and possessions of the G√°ikw√°r's house, besides acquisitions from other chiefs, recovering the districts of Visnagar, Kheralu, Vadnagar, Vij√°pur, and P√°tan from Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n. Thus the Marathas completely took over Gujarat and Mughal rule ended.

Born and raised in Akron, Ohio, Freshwaters was arrested in 1957 for the death of Eugene Flynt, whom he struck and killed while speeding. He pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter and, after a brief sentence at the infamous Ohio State Reformatory, he escaped from an honor farm in 1959. In the intervening years, Freshwaters lived under an assumed name and sought work as a truck driver. He was nearly apprehended in 1975 while living in West Virginia, but then-Governor Arch A. Moore Jr. refused to return him to Ohio officials because of his positive reputation. In 2015, the US Marshals Service set up a cold case unit in northern Ohio, and their investigation led them to a trailer home in Melbourne, Florida where they found Freshwaters, living under the alias William Harold Cox. He was arrested without incident and flown back to Ohio, where he was incarcerated at the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. He was released on parole in June 2016, and he moved back to West Virginia. Freshwaters is known as the \\"Shawshank Fugitive\\" due to his time incarcerated at the Ohio State Reformatory, made famous by the 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption. He was the object of the longest capture in the history of the U.S. Marshals. Biography Freshwaters was born on April 18, 1936 in Akron, Ohio. On July 3, 1957, Freshwaters was speeding when he struck and killed Army veteran Eugene Flynt in Akron. He pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 120 years in prison. Soon, his sentence was suspended and he was given a five-year probation term. After violating the terms of the agreement, he was sentenced again to 20 years at the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield on February 19, 1959. Freshwaters gained the trust of officials at the facility with good behavior, and was transferred to Sandusky Honor Farm in Perkins Township to carry out his sentence. He escaped from the farm on September 30, 1959, though the details of his escape have never been disclosed. In the intervening years, Freshwaters lived under an assumed name and sought work as a truck driver and a mobile librarian. He initially traveled to Florida, where he obtained a Social Security card under the alias William Harold Cox. He later returned north and settled in Hurricane, West Virginia, where he worked for Hennis Trucking and Chemical Leaman Tank Lines. He also worked as a mobile librarian. In October 1975, he was arrested on an Ohio warrant in Charleston, West Virginia after authorities determined his identity. The community largely respected and enjoyed the presence of Freshwaters, who at this point in his life played the guitar and held a strong affinity for country music. Governor Arch A. Moore Jr. refused to send him back to Ohio, and praised his \\"flawless, 16-year residency\\" in an official letter. Moore wrote that while he had committed a crime, Freshwaters was largely a good citizen. He was released, and went into hiding again. He settled in the Melbourne, Florida area under the name of William Harold Cox by 1986, living with one of his sons. By the time of his arrest, Freshwaters was living in a ramshackle trailer home on the property of Florida Senator Thad Altman's parents. According to J.D. Gallop of Florida Today, \\"he was a caretaker on the expansive marshland property, keeping mostly to himself while occasionally fishing and warding off would-be trespassers.\\" Arrest and release In early 2015, the Marshals Service set up a cold case unit in northern Ohio, reopening an active search for Freshwaters. They determined that he may be living in the Melbourne area and approached him on May 4, 2015. Authorities showed Freshwaters a photograph of himself from 1959 and asked if he had seen that man, to which he responded that he hadn't \\"seen him in a long time\\". He soon confessed and was arrested without incident. At the time of his arrest, he was the object of the longest capture in the history of the U.S. Marshals. He was extradited back to Ohio, and served at the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. According to Gallop, \\"more than 2,000 people from half a dozen states wrote in to the parole board to support him.\\" On February 25, 2016, the Ohio Adult Parole Authority voted to release Freshwaters after his attorney argued he had caused no harm in his years evading officials. He was placed on parole with five years supervision. He was released June 15, 2016.

Biography Ancestry Michael Johann von der Borch came from the Courlandish branch of the noble family . His parents were the Polish chancellor (1715-1780) and Ludwika Anna (1725‚Äì1788).Article Borch. In: Hermann Soltmann: Historisch-heraldisches Handbuch zum genealogischen Taschenbuch der gr√§flichen H√§user. Justus Perthes, Gotha 1855, p. 79. He was born in VarakƒºƒÅni in present-day Latvia. Career Michael Johann von der Borch was educated and raised at the family estate by French teachers, as well as partly in Poland, to some extent at the Collegium Pium in Warsaw. He entered Polish military service in 1762 and obtained the rank of colonel in the hussars no later than 1776. According to some sources, he was wounded by during the kidnapping of Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski in 1771 while trying to protect the king. Thanks to his loyalty and to his skill, he was promoted to Quartermaster general of Lithuania in 1781, became a member of the Ministry of War in 1786 and eventually promoted to Lieutenant General. In addition, he was made starost of Ludza (Latgale) in 1772 and from 1787 voivode of the Belz Voivodeship (today in Ukraine), where he promoted the spreading of the Polish language. Between 1774 and 1778 he conducted an extensive Grand Tour through Germany, France, Switzerland and Italy. His tour included a visit to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta on Malta. He was inspired to visit Sicily and Malta by reading the then-popular book A Tour through Sicily and Malta by Patrick Brydone. On Sicily he dedicated himself to extensive studies of mineralogy between September 1776 and April 1777. He published the results of his studies in seven Italian scientific publications and later, in extended form, as books translated into French. In his Italian Journey, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe speaks favourably of von der Borch. His extensive natural history collections where still piously preserved in the castle of VarakƒºƒÅni as late as 1868. In recognition of his work as a naturalist, the Brachiopod Bicarinatina borchi is named after von der Borch. In 1783, he was elevated to the rank of Imperial Count by the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II. In 1790 he traveled to England on a mission for the Polish king, whose complete trust von der Borch enjoyed. Following the Third Partition of Poland he retired from all official duties and settled on his estate in VarakƒºƒÅni. Already in 1789 he had hired the Italian architect Vincenzo de Mazotti to rebuild VarakƒºƒÅni Palace and redesign the garden of the estate, which had been in the family since 1483. Among other decorations, Michael Johann von der Borch was awarded the Order of the Lion of Bavaria, the Order of Saint Stanislaus and the Order of the White Eagle. As a writer he concentrated on natural sciences, maintained international scientific contacts and was a member of several academies. Family In 1783 he married Countess Eleonore Christina von Browne of Camus (1766‚Äì1844) in Riga, the daughter of the Russian governor general of Livonia George Browne. The couple had seven children. Controversy The biographical data presented above is based mainly on German-language sources, which to an essential part are based on the works of Karl Eduard von Napiersky. In the Polish literature, the political career of von der Borch ‚Äì but not his scientific career ‚Äì is portrayed differently. For example, his service in the Polish army is not well documented and his relationship to the king has been described as strenuous.

The lake was excavated to provide fill for the construction of Interstate 75. The lake is a rowing venue and hosted the 2017 World Rowing Championships. History The area was originally used as pasture land. The land was excavated for Interstate 75, which runs to the east of the lake. The section of Interstate 75 between U.S. Route 301 north of the lake, to River Road near Venice further south opened in 1981. Cooper Creek flows through the lake and drains in Braden River further north. In 1995, the land changed ownership from APAC-Florida Incorporated to Sarasota County for US$2.2 million. Sarasota County named the area North Metro Park. At the time, access was by dirt road only from The Meadows, a community immediately to the west, and recreational use apart from motor boats was permitted. In 2003, the Benderson Development Company moved to an area immediately north of the park. A year later, the park's name was changed to Cooper Creek Park. From 2005 onwards, Benderson Development Co. leased the northernmost 101 acres of the park. The company then donated US$1 million to Sarasota County and was given naming rights in return, and the name changed to Nathan Benderson Park on November 20, 2007, after the company's founder. Benderson Development Co. was then given approval to develop 276 acres adjacent to the park, and in return was required to develop a master plan for the park, management plan, and construction plan for further development. The concept plan was approved in 2010, and the development plan the following year. Also in 2010, a non-profit organization was set up for the management of the park ‚Äì Suncoast Aquatic Nature Center Associates Inc. (SANCA). North Cattlemen Road was realigned in 2012 so that a regatta course meeting the requirements of the International Rowing Federation (FISA) could be established. In 2013, the lake was lengthened and deepened, and an island created to reduce wave action. Nathan Benderson Park officially opened to the public in 2014. North Cattlemen Road provides the main access to the venue. Event history During 2009, the first four rowing regattas were held on the lake. In 2013, president Barack Obama, put his support behind Sarasota County's bid to host the 2017 World Rowing Championships. The other applicant for the regatta was Plovdiv in Bulgaria, which had hosted the 2012 World Rowing Championships. Officials from FISA visited Nathan Benderson Park in April 2013. Later in 2013, the championships were awarded to Sarasota. Since the 2017 World Rowing Championships, the park was host for the 2018 World Rowing Masters Regatta and the 2019 World Rowing U23 Championships. In 2014, the lake was used by the International Breast Cancer Paddlers' Commission for a dragon boating convention. In 2015, the first stage of the Modern Pentathlon World Cup was held on the lake, and in the following year, the final race was held at Nathan Benderson Park. The USRowing Youth Nationals were held on the lake in 2015 and 2017, and are in a three-year run from 2019 to 2021.

TQF Association's five main core functions are as follow: # Harmonization of TQF certification with international food safety standards. # Authorization of independent and impartial third-party certification bodies to assess compliance with TQF standards. # Supervision and monitoring of certification bodies for the TQF Product Certification Scheme by an independent and impartial third-party accreditation body TAF (Taiwan Accreditation Foundation). # Implement unannounced and unscheduled annual surveillance auditing. # Promotion of a comprehensive upgrade on the professional competences of the food industry.  Duties  # Establish a food safety management scheme to ensure safe and quality foods are delivered to consumers # Drive changes and continuous improvement in align with global food safety management systems and requirements # Drive for continuous improvement in enhancing services and quality offered by entire food supply chain # Conduct professional training, academic research and promotion to enhance industry standard on food safety # Establish a mutual communication platform for members # Others in accordance with TQF mission  Services  # Provide consultation for food sanitation and safety regulation and labelling # Establish TQF product certification scheme via on-line registration # Provide consultation on FDA's regulation for supplier compulsory entry to \\"Food Traceability System\\", which will covers upstream tracing and downstream tracking of ingredients, production, processing, distribution and sales # Provide consumers a platform to consult food safety requirements # Promote TQF product certification scheme # Promote food industry self-regulation and international standards gearing  Establishment  In 1983, the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) of the Republic of China, Taiwan, introduced for the first time the US Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) system into Taiwan, actively promoting the Taiwan Food GMP Certification System, and encouraging food enterprises to voluntarily certify for the food GMP standard. In 1994, GMP certified food enterprises established the ‚ÄúTaiwan Food GMP Association‚Äù in order to promote the food GMP Certification System. In 2000, the food GMP officially entered the period of ‚ÄúJoint Promotion of Government and Private Sector‚Äù, in which the government and the food industry private sector cooperate with each other to actively promote food GMP and enhance acceptance and public trust in food manufacturing. Taiwan Food GMP Association functioned as a bridge between the government, industry and consumers, promoting the voluntary implementation of food safety management system by the food industry. In March 2015, food safety issues were brought to the public's attention, in response to this and to make Taiwan food safety and quality certification system to be more open, transparent, and independent, Taiwan Food GMP Association made its transition to Taiwan Quality Food (TQF) Association, extending the invitation to raw material/food ingredients/additive industry, wholesalers, retailers, academia experts and consumer groups joining forces to ensure food safety. Additionally, with the hope of achieving future international recognition by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) and bring Taiwan up to the international level. In June 2015, the IDB officially transferred the ‚ÄúTaiwan Food Good Manufacturing Practices (Food GMP) Certification Program‚Äù, including its management system and the GMP certification mark, to the Taiwan Quality Food (TQF) Association. TQF Association obtained the intellectual property rights of the registered mark in September 2015, and starting promoting the TQF Product Certification System, while in charge of the management and supervision of the mark. An impartial third-party accreditation body, the Taiwan Accreditation Foundation (TAF), which is an officially recognized accreditation body and a member of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) signatory to the Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA), is responsible for the accreditation and supervision of certifications bodies for the TQF Product Certification Scheme. Hereafter, TQF Association undertook the role of IDB to assist food manufacturers in Taiwan, with the mission of supporting them in transitioning from GMP to TQF certification. Within this context, Dr. Bonnie Sun Pan was appointed by the TQF Board of Directors as the Chairperson to lead the TQF Association towards internationalization.

Two or three examples were built between 1929 and 1932, using at least two different engines, but neither variant reached production. Design and development The Albert A-10 had a cantilever, one-piece parasol wing of thick section mounted on four short, vertical struts from the fuselage. The wing was unusual in plan, with a convex leading edge and a straight, unswept trailing edge, rather like that of Albert's earlier Albert TE.1 parasol winged single-seater. Narrow-chord ailerons occupied all the trailing edge. The wing structure included multiple spruce and plywood box-spars and ply skin. The Albert 10 was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 6Pa six-cylinder, liquid cooled inline engine, though Salmson or Lorraine radial engines could also be fitted using a different mounting. There was a fire wall at the rear of the engine. The Hispano was cooled with a rectangular, shuttered radiator under the nose and there were twin fuel tanks in the wing with dump valves for emergencies. Behind the engine the wooden fuselage was rectangular in section and built around four longerons and frames. A windowed cabin under the wing had side-by-side seats for two passengers or, in air ambulance configuration, one seat and a stretcher side by side for patient and medic. The cabin could also be configured to carry freight. The pilot's open cockpit was behind the cabin and just behind the trailing edge of the wing. A second seat to the pilot's right, equipped with dual control, could accommodate either a co-pilot or another passenger. The structure of the Albert A-10's empennage was wooden and similar to that of the wing. Its quadrant-shaped fin was part of the fuselage and carried a large, roughly semi-circular, unbalanced rudder. Its elliptical plan horizontal tail was mounted at mid-fuselage height with a one-piece, unbalanced elevator. It had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with its mainwheels on cranked, split axles from the centreline of the fuselage underside; the track was . On the prototype the axle ends were rubber sprung to faired steel V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons, though production aircraft would have had oleo strut shock absorbers. A steel spring tailskid reached out beyond the end of the fuselage. The date of the first flight is not known precisely: in early October it was described as just completed but by mid-November it had obtained its certificate of airworthiness. It was still flying at the Villacoublay test ground in February 1930. Though the A-10 had been designed from the start to be convertible into an ambulance aircraft and to accept Salmson engines of similar power to the Hispano, the A.XI or A-11S (S for sanitaire or ambulance) was not reported until 1932, fitted with a closely cowled Salmson radial. It also had a different undercarriage to that of the first A-10, retaining the cranked axles but adding drag struts to the fuselage centre-line and inward- sloping oleo struts to the lower longerons. In April 1932 it was undergoing official tests at Villacoublay which continued at least into June. In October it was one of five prototypes that took part in the Tour de Propagande (Publicity Tour), flying around northern France in eight daily stages. Two A-11s flew. It is not known if one was the A-10, re-engined. Variants ;A-10: Transport, Hispano engine. ;A-11S: Air ambulance, Salmson 9AC engine.

The film stars Vaibhav and Priya Bhavani Shankar, with Vivek Prasanna, Indhuja Ravichandran, Arun Prasath and Amrutha Srinivasan in supporting roles. Karthik Subbaraj presented the film and Kaarthekeyen Santhanam produced the film through their production house, Stone Bench Creations. The film's original soundtrack and score were jointly composed by Santhosh Narayanan and Pradeep Kumar, with the latter making his composing debut in Tamil cinema. The film focuses on 'Idhayam' Murali, a happy-go-lucky light music singer, and his relationships with his longtime, one-sided love interest Madhumitha, his sister Sudarvizhi and his best friend Vinoth. Production was completed silently and the venture was first reported by the media during June 2017, with the film being shot primarily in Royapuram, Chennai. The film was released on 18 October 2017, coinciding with Diwali, and received positive critical reception.  Plot  Murali (Vaibhav), also known as 'Idhayam' Murali by his friends as he is like the emotional lead character from the film, Idhayam (1990), rings his friends, Vinoth (Vivek Prasanna) and Kishore (Arun Prasath) informing them that he is going to commit suicide, as he is not able to bear the engagement of his college mate, Madhu (Priya Bhavani Shankar), whom Murali has feelings of one- sided love. In an attempt to stop his suicide, Vinoth and Kishore request Madhu to speak badly about Murali, which Madhu does hesitantly. On hearing this, Murali feels outraged and cancels his suicide attempt. He also believes that Madhu is a bad girl. However, he blabbers about Madhu and how he loved her which slightly moves Madhu. The marriage is postponed by a year. One year later, life moves on and Kishore invites Vinoth and Murali for his wedding. However, Vinoth is injured in an accident, so, Murali attends the marriage and also performs with his music crew, \\"Meyadha Maan\\". Murali meets Madhu and they pick up a quarrel over a room allotment. Murali walks out of the marriage after understanding that both Vinoth and Kishore are hell bent in ensuring that he does not torture Madhu during the marriage. Madhu is pained to hear that Murali still does not know about the drama on that suicide night. Meanwhile, Sudarvizhi (Indhuja Ravichandran), Murali's sister learns about her brother's one side love with Madhu and falls in love with Vinoth. She ensures a fall out with Vinoth as he refuses to see her other than a sister. Murali learns that Sudarvizhi is in love with Vinoth and happily assures her that he will ensure that she is married to Vinoth. Vinoth does not know about Sudarvizhi's love and feels that she had quarrelled with him as she was suffering from trauma due to a fever and a headache. One day, Vinoth meets Madhu and thanks her for her noble gesture. Suddenly Madhu falls down unconscious. Vinoth admits her in a hospital and is rushing to fetch money for her treatment. Murali is suspicious that Vinoth has fallen in love with someone and follows him to the hospital. Murali gets upset when he sees his friend aid the treatment of Madhu, who he believes is his sworn enemy. Subsequently, Murali comes to know about the drama played by Vinoth and attacks him furiously for making him believe that Madhu is a bad girl. In a jiffy, he starts rejoicing as he realises that Madhu is not a bad girl and is still not married. Few days later, Murali finds Madhu falling unconscious and brings her home safely. Soon, Madhu and Murali bury the past and develop a friendship which enrages Madhu's father (Varghese Mathew). Madhu's brother invites Murali for a family function to show him his place. Murali gleefully accepts the invitation. While he enthralls Madhumitha and children by his presence, Madhu's parents are irritated by his presence. Madhu comes to Murali's home the next day to shout at him for accepting the veiled invitation from his family. However she bonds with Sudarvizhi easily and has a good time at Murali's house. Suddenly, Vinoth brings in a marriage alliance for Sudarvizhi. Murali rejects the alliance saying that he has decided to marry his sister to Vinoth. This shocks Vinoth and he is even shocked to see Madhu in Murali's house. Vinoth walks away angrily from Murali's house. Madhu persuades Murali to talk with Vinoth and gives an idea to unite Vinoth and Sudarvizhi. The idea works well and Vinoth reciprocates Sudarvizhi's love. Eventually Madhu informs Murali that she is in love with Murali. Madhu's father finds them as a pair and he hastens Madhu's arranged marriage ceremony with a different groom. Murali and Madhu plan to stop the marriage by having premarital intercourse, but they both pick up a quarrel while executing their plan in midway and part ways. Madhu gets ready for marriage, while Murali vows to complete Sudarvizhi's marriage before her marriage. After a few interesting twists and turns, Vinoth marries Sudarvizhi and Madhu reveals that she got pregnant by Murali through the earlier plan of stopping the arranged marriage ceremony. Madhu later ends up in attempting to commit suicide as Murali refuses to marry her. As the credits roll, Madhu and Murali sign the marriage papers in the register office and the movie ends with Murali singing on stage with his wife Madhu recording his performance from the audience area.

Madhu (2013) featuring actors Sananth, Roshni Abraham and Vivek Prasanna, was earlier included as one of the six stories in Stone Bench Creations' anthology film Bench Talkies ‚Äì The First Bench, which had a theatrical release in March 2015. Rathna Kumar initially had no intentions of making Madhu into a feature film and had developed it only for his portfolio, but obliged to Subbaraj's request as producers were not keen on listening to his other scripts. Rathna Kumar set the film in North Chennai as he was inspired by the creative talents of people in the Royapuram and Kasimedu area, where he found several singers, lyric writers and percussionists during his visits to the areas. The film's lead character runs a light music troupe, making the setting of Royapuram apt for the script. The lead character's shyness to talk to his lover, meant that Rathna Kumar chose to give the character the name of 'Idhayam' Murali, derived from the timid character made famous by the late actor Murali in Kathir's romantic drama Idhayam (1991). Rathna Kumar wrote the first draft of the feature film keeping Sananth, who had starred in the short film, in mind. However, the producers opted against signing a relative newcomer and chose Vaibhav to portray the lead role. To prepare for his role, Vaibhav observed the emotions and body language of real stage singers by watching videos. As Roshni Abraham had chosen not to become a feature film actress, Rathna Kumar then discussed the leading female role with Sai Pallavi, who opted against signing the film. He subsequently announced a casting call online, following which television actress Priya Bhavani Shankar got in touch. Following a successful audition, she was selected to play the leading role of Madhumitha, with Rathna Kumar stating that her on-screen \\"image\\" worked for the film. Priya later revealed that she was keen to do the film as it had the backing of Karthik Subbaraj, whose work she liked. Indhuja Ravichandran was selected to be a part of the film after impressing the director with her work in other short films, and was initially worried about her future work and image if she portrayed the sister of Vaibhav's character, before agreeing to star in the film. Vivek Prasanna was the only lead actor to retain his role from the short film. The film's composer Santhosh Narayanan was keen to allow his long-time collaborator Pradeep Kumar to also work on the film as a co-composer, and played a role in bringing him into the project. The film's shoot progressed silently in Royapuram, Chennai and was first revealed to the media only after ninety percent of the shoot was completed. Stone Bench Productions had made the film alongside their commitments for another film directed by Karthik Subbaraj, titled Mercury (2018) starring Prabhu Deva. The teaser trailer of the film was released by actor Dhanush through his Twitter handle in late July 2017. As a part of the film's promotions, the makers dubbed the film as \\"Royapurathu La La Land\\" (La La Land in Royapuram) and released posters and captions on the trailer to depict the film in that particular way.  Soundtrack  The film's soundtrack and score were jointly composed by Santhosh Narayanan and Pradeep Kumar, with the latter making his debut as a composer in Tamil films. Prior to the release of the album, the \\"Thangachi Song\\" was released as a single to coincide with the Hindu festival of Raksha Bandhan on 7 August 2017. A second single, \\"Enna Naan Seiven\\" was also then released on 25 August 2017. The full album, containing seven tracks, was released by Think Music India on 27 September 2017. The album was launched at Loyola College, Chennai with the cast and crew in attendance. The album received positive response from critics. The critics from Behindwoods.com gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, saying that \\"Santhosh Narayanan is at his usual best\\" and that \\"it was a fitting debut for Pradeep Kumar as music director\\". Likewise, Karthik Srinivasan of Milliblog.com wrote \\"the Santhosh-Pradeep combo wins again\\". Post-release, the \\"Thangachi Song\\" and \\"Address Song\\" garnered popularity.  Release  Meyaadha Maan was initially set for release on 17 November 2017, but as some Tamil films that were scheduled for Diwali got delayed, the producers and distributors felt that moving the release forward to coincide with the festival would garner larger audiences. They also felt that spillover audiences from the other high-profile release, Mersal (2017), would instead choose to see Meyaadha Maan. Subsequently, the film had a theatrical release across India on 18 October 2017. The satellite rights of the film were sold to Zee Tamil. Positive feedback from critics and audiences, resulted in a steady growth in the number of screens across Tamil Nadu, Malaysia and Singapore within days of the film's release. The film also benefited from positive word- of-mouth and ended up as a commercial success at the box office.

The World Spider Catalog regards it as a nomen dubium (dubious name). Only one female has been described; this was captured in the Florida Keys, but is likely to have been imported from Mexico. Description The single described female of Tliltocatl aureoceps has a body length of 55 mm. The fourth leg is longest at 54 mm. The basic colour is described as \\"dark chestnut\\". The carapace, legs and abdomen have fine golden brown hairs; the legs and abdomen have in addition longer yellowish hairs (setae). Plumose setae are present on the femur of the fourth leg. Taxonomy Tliltocatl aureoceps was first described, as Eurypelma aureoceps, by Ralph Chamberlin in 1917, based on a single female collected earlier by J. B. Holder in Florida. The specific name aureoceps means \\"golden head\\". It was transferred to Brachypelma by Andrew Smith in 1993, and to Tliltocatl, along with other species of Brachypelma, in 2020. Little is known of the origin of the type specimen. The collection number (MCZ 43) suggests that it was acquired by the Museum of Comparative Zoology before 1870. The location is given as Tortugas Island, Florida. Smith suggests that the spider may have been imported with building material from Mexico during the construction of Fort Jefferson, as it appears to be a typical Mexican species of what was then the genus Brachypelma.

He was born at Northchurch in Hertfordshire, though the precise date of his birth is not known, and he died at Kensington in London. Wroth was educated at Uppingham School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he appeared in the two matches between Cambridge University and the MCC in 1848, playing once for each side, but had little success in either match; it is not known whether he batted right- or left-handed and there is no record that he bowled in either game. Wroth graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1848, and this converted to a Master of Arts in 1864. He was ordained as a deacon in the Church of England in 1849 and as a priest the following year. He was curate at Brompton Regis in Somerset and at Pightlesthorne in Buckinghamshire before he arrived at St Philip's Church, Clerkenwell, in 1851 as curate, becoming priest-in-charge in 1854 and remaining there until his death.

He would claim that he was born in Switzerland and that his family owned the CIBA-Geigy pharmaceutical company. He attended McGill University, in Montreal, Quebec. Maison Joseph Lamoureux Maison Joseph Lamoureux Shafferman's family home in Montreal was the Maison Joseph Lamoureux at 143 chemin de la C√¥te-Sainte-Catherine. Before moving to 143 St Catherine Road the family lived at 711 Stuart Avenue. Ben Shafferman bought the Maison Lamoureux in 1963. His son Victor Shafferman lived there while studying at McGill University, and inherited it at the death of his mother in 2000. At Shafferman's death in 2009, his spouse sold all the couple's residences, including the Maison Lamoureux. This residence known as Maison Joseph Lamoureux, who built it in 1898, is the work of the architect Joseph-Arthur Godin. Godin left in Montreal a diverse architectural heritage. He is also the architect of the Acad√©mie Querbe, churches and theaters like Th√©√¢tre La Tulipe (the former Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s) and the Joseph-Arthur Godin House (today the H√¥tel Godin, corner Sherbrooke and Saint-Laurent). 973 Fifth Avenue 973 and 972 Fifth Avenue Victor Shafferman owned 973 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, designed by architectural firm McKim, Mead & White (together with nearby Payne Whitney House). The house was built by Henry Cook in 1902, who owned the entire block from 78th to 79th Streets. He left it to his daughter who sold it to Joseph Feder. In 1948 it was sold to the Mormon Church and used as a training center. In 1978 it was bought by Shafferman for $600,000 ($2,332,676.33 in 2017). It was sold in 2012 for $42 million, asking price was $49 million. Blairsden Blairsden In the early 2000s Shafferman started a relationship with an architectural student, a man much younger than him. Around the same time he bought Blairsden, a mansion located at Peapack- Gladstone, New Jersey, designed by architectural firm Carr√®re and Hastings. The house was built in 1807 by investment banker C. Ledyard Blair and in 1950 sold to the Sisters of St. John the Baptist. The sisters sold it in 2002 to the Foundation for Classical Architecture owned by Shafferman. Shafferman and his partner started the restoration of the mansion, but Shafferman died before restoration was complete and the mansion was later sold in 2012 for $4.5 million. The Diamond District Shafferman was the longtime owner of two buildings, 15 West 47th Street and 22 West 48th Street, in what is called the Diamond District. They were put on the market in 2012 for an asking price of $115 million. Personal life Shafferman moved in the New York High Society. In 1986 he was the date of fashion designer Mary McFadden when she attended the 35th Annual April In Paris Ball at the Waldorf Hotel.

The aqueduct comprises of open canals, tunnels, and closed pipelines that connect the Upper Nepean Scheme with the Prospect Reservoir. The aqueduct is managed by the Sydney Catchment Authority on behalf of WaterNSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999. Description The Upper Canal forms a major component of the Upper Nepean Scheme. The Upper Nepean Scheme supplies water from the Cataract River at Broughtons Pass to the Crown Street reservoir, a distance of . The Upper Canal commences by tunnel from Pheasant's Nest Weir on the Nepean River and extends through the local government areas of Wollondilly, Camden, Campbelltown, Liverpool, Fairfield, and Cumberland, to terminate at the Prospect Reservoir. After the Nepean and Cataract tunnels, the aqueduct drops just in elevation over its course, or just 0.1 percent grade. The canal system is built from a variety of materials, depending on the nature of the country it passes through. Where the ground is soft, the canal system is trapezoidal in shape and the sides lined with unreinforced concrete slabs. In other sections, the canal is u-shaped and the sides are lined with sandstone masonry. Where the canal system is cut into solid rock, it is unlined. Tunnels allow the aqueduct to pass under hills. These are unlined if cut through solid rock, or lined with brick or sandstone if cut through softer material. Above ground pipelines allow the canal system to cross creeks and gullies. These were inverted iron syphons resting on sandstone piers. The Upper Canal has only of pipelines crossing nine creeks and the Main Southern railway line; with of tunnels and of open canal. Many of the original iron pipes remain in use, some lined with plastic sleeves to protect the pipes and keep them waterproof. Many of the original mechanisms to control and divert the water's flow - such as stop logs, penstocks, and gate valves - are also still in use. In recent years, water control structures have been installed to assist with regulation of water levels in the canal and to cater for varying flow rates. It is estimated that the Upper Nepean System and, hence, the Upper Canal System, supplies in the range of 20 to 40 per cent of Sydney's daily demand for potable water. History In 1867, the Governor of New South Wales appointed a Commission to recommend a scheme for Sydney's water supply, and by 1869 it was recommended that construction commence on the Upper Nepean Scheme. This consisted of two diversion weirs, located at Pheasant's Nest and Broughton's Pass, in the Upper Nepean River catchment, with water feeding into a series of tunnels, canals and aqueducts known as the Upper Canal. It was intended that water be fed by gravity from the catchment into a reservoir at Prospect. This scheme was to be Sydney's fourth water supply system, following the Tank Stream, Busby's Bore and the Botany Swamps. The Upper Canal, now managed by the Sydney Catchment Authority, is divided into eleven maintenance sections, from Pheasant's Nest to the Prospect Reservoir. Historically each of these sections had its own section keeper, with a cottage built along the section.

The donkey became popular with the troops who would send photos to children back home. In 2011, Smoke traveled half way around the world to the United States, the only donkey to make such a journey. The process to relocate Smoke from Iraq to the United States required senior level diplomatic coordination by multiple countries, and the assistance of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Smoke's relatively quick visa process has been contrasted with the lengthy visa process for Iraqi humans who worked as interpreters for the US Army. More than a decade after the Special Immigrant Visa program was created to facilitate the immigration of former interpreters who now face violence for their work with the US, few have been admitted, and the program has been almost totally curtailed by the Trump regime. Once in the United States, Smoke lived at Take Flight Farms in Omaha, Nebraska until his death on August 14, 2012 of natural causes. In 2016, Smoke the Donkey: A Marine's Unlikely Friend, a book about his life by Cate Folsom, was published by University of Nebraska Press.

PEWS Score or PEWS System are objective assessment tools that incorporate the clinical manifestations that have the greatest impact on patient outcome. Pediatric intensive care is a subspecialty designed for the unique parameters of pediatric patients that need critical care. The first PICU was opened in Europe by Goran Haglund. Over the past few decades, research has proven that adult care and pediatric care vary in parameters, approach, technique, etc. PEWS is used to help determine if a child that is in the Emergency Department should be admitted to the PICU or if a child admitted to the floor should be transferred to the PICU. It was developed based on the success of MEWS in adult patients to fit the vital parameters and manifestations seen in children. The goal of PEWS is to provide an assessment tool that can be used by multiple specialties and units to objectively determine the overall status of the patient. The purpose of this is to improve communication within teams and across fields, recognition time and patient care, and morbidity and mortality rates. Monaghan created the first PEWS based on MEWS, interviews with pediatric nurses, and observation of pediatric patients. Currently, multiple PEWS systems are in circulation. They are similar in nature, measuring the same domains, but vary in the parameters used to measure the domains. Therefore, some have been proven more effective than others, however, all of them have been statistically significant in improving patient care times and outcomes.  History of pediatric critical care  Pediatric intensive care has been established as a sub-specialty of medicine over the past two decades. It grew out of a need for increasingly complex pediatric care, long-term management of disease, and advancements in medical and surgical sub-specialties, as well as, life-sustaining therapies.(Epstein and Brill, 2005, p.987) The development of pediatric critical care followed the establishment of pediatric intensive care units or PICUs. The first PICU was opened in Europe by Goran Haglund in 1955 at Children's Hospital of Goteburg in Sweden.(Epstein and Brill, 2005, p.988) Advancements in Neonatology and neonatal intensive care, pediatric general surgery, pediatric cardiac surgery, pediatric anesthesiology lead to its opening because of the need to care for critically ill infants and children. Over the next forty years, hundreds of PICUs were established in academic institutions, children's hospitals, and community hospitals. In 1981, the Society of Critical Care Medicine, SCCM, which express guidelines and standards for adult critical care, recognized pediatric critical care as unique from adults and created a separate section within the SSCM for their care. Other institutes followed throughout the 80's, by 1990 there were multiple training programs, certification available, and sub-board on pediatric critical care. Pediatric critical care is now seen as a multidisciplinary field that includes a team of nurse specialists, respiratory therapists, nutritionists, pharmacists, social workers, physical therapists, occupational therapist, and other medical professionals.  Development of Pediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS)  To reduce the occurrence of second- rate care, improve outcomes, and enhance quality of life, systems to identify adult patients at risk for rapid clinical deterioration were established based on \\"early warning signs\\". These signs brought attention to key clinical parameters that, when affected, encouraged emergent intervention. Modified Early Warning System (MEWS) is a tool for nurses to help monitor their patients and improve how quickly a rapidly deteriorating client receives the needed care developed from early warning signs. MEWS helps increase objectivity and communication within hospitals. Patients with progressing critical illness can be predicted and prevented, but failure to identify the signs and lack of prompt intervention for patients developing acute and critical illness remain a problem. Care for them is challenging because children may be asymptomatic until critically ill. Pediatric patients have unique characteristics and different clinical parameters for each age group; adult parameters and concepts cannot be applied to the pediatric patient. Children have greater compensatory mechanisms than adults and can maintain a normal blood pressure despite considerable loss of fluid. For example, a child with sepsis or severe dehydration may seem unaffected and the acute condition is often identified only by the affected vital parameters.(Jensen, Aagaard, Olesen, and Kirkegaard, 2017, p.2) However, their condition deteriorates quickly once compensation mechanisms are overwhelmed. In one review, sixty-one percent of pediatric cardiac arrests were caused by respiratory failure and twenty-nine percent by shock, which are both preventable and potentially reversible causes.(Monaghan, 2005, p.33) Thus, to ensure timely care for pediatric patients and improve outcomes, systemic assessment of key symptoms and their severity is essential. Early recognition and appropriate intervention are equally important in children and may prevent the need for admission to intensive care. Since children seem relatively unaffected until shortly before respiratory failure and cardiac arrest, Monaghan and a group of associates were interested in developing an early warning score system to help nurses assess pediatric patients objectively and improve mortality rates with timely recognition and treatment. They interviewed staff, reviewed MEWS, and conducted research regarding pediatric clinical conditions and markers used to judge severity. Clinical parameters had to be carefully considered due to the uniqueness of the population. For instance, adult systems use blood pressure as one of the main predictors of decline, however, as described, in children hypotension is considered a late sign of shock and multi-system organ failure. Low blood pressure then is a pre-morbid sign and potentially too late for optimum outcomes. The goal was to create an easy-to-use and impartial system that improved outcomes. Monaghan and his multidisciplinary team created what is referred to as PEWS, Pediatric Early Warning Signs. Although still in its early years of use, it is now a standard practice in most hospitals and has already shown to identify children who need a higher level of care, decrease code blue incidents, and improve staff communication and patient safety. In other words, children showing signs of clinical decline are assessed by appropriate medical and nursing staff and receive optimum care during their acute episode.(Monaghan, 2005, p.35)  Pediatric assessment   Normal Vital Range  Pediatric patients' -- infancy to adolescence‚Äîvital parameters vary by each age group and are different than an adult's healthy range. When reviewing vital signs in each of the age groups, be alert for significant changes and compare with normal values for each of the signs. For best results, when taking vital signs of infants, respirations are counted first before the infant is disturbed, the pulse next, temperature, and then blood pressure last. thumb = Temperature = Temperature should be taken via rectum if the child is under the age of three, for the greatest accuracy, and then orally, unless they are unable to use the oral thermometer properly. Axillary is the least accurate method, but is commonly used when the child is older than three months and the situation is non-concerning or when an accurate oral temperature can't be obtained.(Agrawal, 2009, p.2) Currently, the use of temporal thermometers, that scan the temporal artery, is gaining popularity and is considered accurate for children three months and older.(Honckenberry and Wilson, 2015) = Heart Rate = There are various pulse sites on the body: the carotid, brachial, radial, femoral, and dorsalis pedis. In children, heart rate is preferably taken apically. To count the rate, place stethoscope on the anterior chest at the fifth intercostal space in a midclavicular position. Each ‚Äúlub-dub‚Äù sound is one beat. It should be taken for one full minute, as well as, determined if the rhythm is regular or irregular. = Respirations = The procedure for measuring a child‚Äôs respiratory rate is essentially the same as for an adult. Respiration rate may be taken by observing rise and fall, placing your hand and feeling the rise and fall, or using a stethoscope.(Agrawal, 2009, p.1) Since a child‚Äôs respiration rate is diaphragmatic, abdominal movement is observed or felt to count the respirations. Like heart rate, respirations should be counted for one full minute. = Blood Pressure = The size of the blood pressure cuff is determined by the size of the child‚Äôs arm or leg. The width of the bladder cuff is two thirds of the length of the long bone of the extremity on which the blood pressure is taken and the length of the bladder cuff should be about three-fourths the circumference and should not overlap. If the bladder of the cuff is too small, the pressure will be falsely high, and if it is too large, falsely low.  Abnormal Findings  Vitals outside of the above parameters are considered abnormal findings. However, before determining additional medical attention is needed, vitals should be repeated to confirm and compared with an individual's baseline assessment. A temperature between 101‚Äì102 is considered a mild fever, 102‚Äì103 a moderate, and 104 or above a high fever, and delirium or convulsions may occur. From birth until adolescence, temperature between 99.8‚Äì100.8 is considered a low-grade fever. If the temperature is taken rectally, it is not considered a fever until it is above 100.4. Once adolescence is reached, it is not considered a fever until 100.4 and if taken rectally, 101. Fever in 3 months and younger is significant and medical referral is needed. Assess the patient to determine if other signs and symptoms are present: flushed face, hot, dry skin, low output, concentrated urine, anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, or vomiting. Older children may complain of sore throat, headaches, aching, and nausea, as well as, other symptoms. Pulse should be checked at distal and proximal sites. Evaluate whether it is normal, bounding, or thready, as well as, compare strength symmetry. Bounding is a stronger than normal pulse and thread a weaker. Unequal pulse is an abnormal finding and indicates a cardiovascular issue. Assess the patient to determine if other signs or symptoms of respiratory ‚Äì retractions, wheezing, nasal flaring, grunting, etc. -- or cardiac ‚Äì cyanosis, irritability, edema, etc. -- distress are present. If a child has any acute distress immediate medical intervention is needed. thumb870x870pxPediatric Early Warning Score Card: All PEWS systems were adapted from Monaghan who developed the first at Royal Alexandra Hospital for Sick Children in Brighton, United Kingdom and are comparative to the example above.  PEWS models  Pediatrician specialists and others who provide care in this field adapted early warning tools from those in practice with adults with the distinct characteristics of the pediatric population; anatomy, physiology, and clinical manifestations are different in pediatric patients than adult. The goal of pediatric early warning systems is to alert staff to deterioration in pediatric patients at the earliest possibility to quickly intervene and improve mortality rates.(Murray, Williams, Pignatarao, and Volpe, 2015, p.166; Fuijkschot et al., 2015, p.15) It is based on the idea that using objective clinical indicators and risk assessment tools will improve communication and improve patient care, however, there is yet to be a standardized model. A variety of PEWS tools exist with multiple parameters, but all models have three domains in common: cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological.(Murray, Williams, Pignataro, and Volpe, 2015, p.171)  Domains  The domains in PEWS represent major body systems that are sensitive to changes in the body and thus create the criteria to be evaluated in a patient to help identify if they are at risk for further deterioration. Parameters on how to measure, such as the importance of including blood pressure, temperature, or nebulizer treatments, change with almost each model.(Murray, Williams, Pignataro, and Volpe, 2015, p.171; Jensen, Aagaard, Olesen, and Kirkegaard, 2017, p.2) The three domains, cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological, though are consistently seen throughout each model and have been clinically proven to help identify patients in the Emergency Department, ED, who require admission to the PICU, as well as, assess in advance the need to adapt a care plan to avoid rapid response.(Murray, Williams, Pignataro, and Volpe, 2015, p.168-170) = Cardiovascular = Heart rate is commonly used in PEWS, as well as, capillary refill. However, only few use blood pressure because it is not considered as reliable of a measure as the other two. As stated previously, children can maintain a stable blood pressure for much longer than adults. Anatomy and physiology is different in infants and children than adults and vary with age, which produces normal ranges for electrocardiograms.(Baruteau et al., 2016, p.151) Capillary refill is used across the lifespan as a cardiovascular assessment parameter because it is a non-invasive, quick test to help determine blood flow to the tissues. Heart rate is a crucial piece of assessment in acutely ill pediatric patients because bradycardia may be a sign of conductive tissue dysfunction and lead to sudden death.(Baruteau et al., 2016, p.152) = Respiratory = Methods in determining a patient's needs related to a respiratory system often requires an accurate health history and a thorough physical examination. Respiratory assessment's are done as part of a comprehensive physical examination or as a focused examination. The judgment in determining whether all or part of the history and physical examination is often completed based on a chief complaint of the patient. Respiratory can be measured by rate, rhythm, characteristics of breathing, and supplemental oxygen use. Different characteristics of breathing are lung sounds, retractions, accessory muscle use, tracheal tug, etc. PEWS uses highly visible and easily monitored characteristics are used, such as retractions, that way there is little variation based on in interpretation. Retractions are a sucking in of the skin around the bones of the chest and illustrate the additional use of muscle to breath, indicated the increased work needed to breath. Similarly, the more supplemental oxygen needed, the less the lungs are providing adequate oxygenation. All of these symptoms indicate respiratory failure, a condition where there is inadequate oxygenation to the body's tissues and organs or inadequate removal of carbon monoxide from the body by the lungs. Left untreated, it is life-threatening. = Neurological = Behavior is typically measured by playing, sleeping, irritable, and confused or reduced response to pain.(Murray, Williams, Pignataro, and Volpe, 2015, p.170) This is due to the fact it is an age-based assessment and pediatric patients have some form of \\"playing\\" as their age appropriate norm. Whether it be gurgling and cooing, coloring, or video games, it is age-specific behavior to a younger population. Irritability in children is often a cue that something is wrong, especially in those unable to communicate verbally due to age or disorder. Other scales simply use level of consciousness as they're neurological assessment, instead of behavior.(Jensen, Aagaard, Olesen, and Kirkegaard, 2017, p.3)  Scoring  Nursing interventions associated with different PEWS scores.Numbers or color are used in scoring of PEWS. The numbers represent the total score added from the domains (pictured in the above table of Monaghan's design) and the colors are easily understandable \\"cautions\\" recognized by most people to help facilitate urgency and in some care settings, communication with patients correlated with numeric scores. 0-2: A score of 0-2 indicates no change in a child's status and regular rounding is acceptable. The plan of care will be continued as is. 3-4: Indicates that a child's care is worsening, but they do not need immediate assistance. The plan of care may change or continued close monitoring will be initiated. 5: The child's status is deteriorating and a change in the plan of care is needed to improve outcomes. This is an urgent situation that requires close monitoring and the involvement of other disciplines. 6+: There are severe consequences if quick intervention is not established, including possible permanent damage or death. A child with a PEWS score of 6+ will mostly be transferred to a PICU to receive the level of critical care they need to improve outcomes with a staff trained to do so.  Application in practice  When implemented, PEWS has had statistically significant impact on multiple units and the care of children. It can identify children admitted to the ED who require admission to the PICU, as well as, help staff assessment of their needs and accurate interventions. It has helped identify more than 75% of code blues within one hour of warning and has the ability to assess more than ten hours earlier the need to adapt a care plan to avoid rapid response. Bedside PEWS, an adopted method for bedside care, can help staff identify when a child is at risk for decline and/or rapidly deteriorating.(Arke et al., 2010, p.e767) Also, it has proven to improve staff communication and patient safety.  Limitations  One limitation in the use of PEWS is that there is not a standard model in practice. Doctors and nurses have access to too many variations of how to use the PEWS assessment tool and there is no defined standard. There is over 30 different variations of the assessment tool available to the medical staff to help diagnose PEWS. PEWS provides an easy, objective way to measure a deviation from normal, however, with variation in model, the score is not completely transferable. Another limitation is since this is relatively new, there is little research done on the implementation of PEWS and the effectiveness of its usage.  Citations   References  * Agrawal, S. (2009).

Description The male holotype of Tliltocatl epicureanus has a total body length of 50 mm. The fourth leg is longest at 62 mm. The carapace and legs are brown; the abdomen is black with rusty-red hairs (setae). Plumose setae are present on the femur of the first leg. Taxonomy Tliltocatl epicureanus was first described, as Eurypelma epicureana, by Ralph Chamberlin in 1925. It was transferred to the genus Brachypelma by Andrew Smith in 1993, retaining the incorrect ending of the specific name, which he corrected to epicureanum in 1995. Chamberlin described a male and a female, both from Chichen Itza in Yucat√°n, Mexico. In November 2019, it was proposed that Brachypelma epicureanum be moved to the genus Tliltocatl; this has been accepted by the World Spider Catalog. Distribution and habitat Tliltocatl epicureanus is found in central Yucat√°n, in moist forest and rainforest. Apparently closely related to T. vagans, it is much less widespread in south- eastern Mexico. Conservation All species of Brachypelma, then including Tliltocatl, were placed on CITES Appendix II in 1994, thus restricting trade. Nevertheless, large numbers of tarantulas caught in the wild continue to be smuggled out of Mexico.

It was decided to put the research institute next to the veterinary school. Planning permission for the site was issued in May 1963. To pay for the cost of the institute, the government put a levy on livestock, later administered by the Meat and Livestock Commission. In October 1966, a new ¬£1m Food Research Institute was announced to be built at Norwich, similarly next to the university. The institute in Somerset was hoped to open in the autumn of 1967.

The novel takes place in the 21st century and centers around a woman named Nora, who accidentally wanders into a magical land. The story involves themes such as magic, social commentary, and romance. The novel makes several references to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Plot summary Nora Fisher is an English teacher trying to earn her PhD in Literature when her boyfriend, Adam, breaks up with her. Nora must attend a wedding that weekend, but while she and her friends stay at a cabin she goes for a walk, carrying an old copy of Pride and Prejudice with her, and loses her way in the woods. She wanders into a graveyard and reads aloud a poem inscribed upon a tombstone. Upon leaving the graveyard, Nora discovers a garden and meets a woman named Ilissa, who invites Nora to her house and insists that Nora attend their party that night. Given a beautiful dress and a miraculous makeover, Nora meets a splendid company of people at the party that night, including Raclin, Ilissa's handsome son. Nora soon forgets about the wedding, and her teaching, and stays at Ilissa's house for an indefinite amount of time, attending parties nearly every night and going hunting with her new friends in the day. She also becomes engaged to Raclin. One day Nora strays from their hunting party and a team of men seize her. They report her to two men: Lord Luklren, and a magician named Aruendiel. They let her go, but Aruendiel warns Nora not to trust Ilissa and her people, a warning that Nora ignores. She marries Raclin and soon becomes pregnant, but one night she has an argument with Raclin because she suspects him of carrying on with other women. Raclin suddenly reveals himself to be a dragon and attacks her, and she falls down a flight of stairs. Ilissa and her people carry her to a bed, fearing that she has had a miscarriage. Nora sends a plea for help to Aruendiel by means of his token, a feather, and a tremendous gust of wind spirits Nora away from Ilissa's house. After flying for over an hour, Nora falls into a courtyard and the magician Aruendiel takes her into his castle and removes what is left of Raclin's child from her body, assuring her that the birth of such a child would have killed her. A woman named Mrs. Toristel takes care of Nora while the latter recovers. Aruendiel explains that Ilissa and her son and guests are Faitoren, magical creatures who cast illusions and specialize in manipulating people. The fancy clothes and beautiful appearances of their parties were illusions, and they had used Nora as a birth mother for Raclin's child, in an attempt to breed more of their species. Aruendiel also explains that they are currently speaking the Ors language, which Nora somehow picked up while under a variety of Ilissa's enchantments; she continues to understand Ors, even after Aruendiel removes Ilissa's spells. The castle lies in a place called the Uland, part of a larger territory called the Northlands. Neither Mrs. Toristel nor Aruendiel knows anything about the United States. Stuck in this alternate land with no technology, Nora gardens and cooks to earn her keep at Aruendiel's castle. Nora finds she still has her wedding ring, which will not come off her finger. Another magician, Hirizjahkinis, invites Aruendiel to Semr, the king's realm, and Aruendiel reluctantly takes Nora with him to keep an eye on her. At Semr they debate about whether to declare war on the Faitoren or cut a deal with them. Aruendiel, who severely distrusts the Faitoren, staunchly opposes King Abele's desire to maintain a peaceful alliance with them. Nora inexplicably finds her copy of Pride and Prejudice in the royal library, and eventually she begins to translate it into Ors so that Aruendiel can sample the literature of her world. While in Semr, Nora has an unpleasant encounter with Ilissa, and then finds out that most people assume that Nora is Aruendiel's mistress. Nora gradually finds out that Aruendiel once had a wife, but murdered her when she had an affair with another man. Aruendiel once also had an affair with Ilissa herself. Back in Uland, Nora expresses interest in learning magic, and Aruendiel challenges Nora by smashing a bowl and telling her to fix it with magic. When she finally manages to fix the bowl, Aruendiel begins to give, impatiently, a series of lessons in magic to Nora. He explains that whereas a wizard captures spirits and forces them to work for him, a magician depends upon his or her own connection with the elements in order to shape them as he or she desires. He refers to the elemental magic as ‚Äútrue magic‚Äù and distrusts the use of spirits and demons in wizardry. One day Aruendiel receives word that the magician Hirizjahkinis and Hirgus Ext, a wizard, have paid a visit to Ilissa's house. Ilissa claims to have taken the two as prisoners and sends Aruendiel a list of demands, including that he return Nora to the Faitoren. Aruendiel refuses the demands and attacks Ilissa himself, but Hirizjahkinis and Hirgus Ext escape without his help. Ilissa tried to trick them into lifting the magical boundaries around the Faitoren realm, or else hoped to force Aruendiel to lift the boundaries. Aruendiel then leaves to visit Lord Luklren in order to make sure that the magician Dorneng Hul is properly maintaining those boundaries. While he is gone, Nora fixes a series of items in the village in order to raise money to buy a new pair of boots, an act which Aruendiel, upon returning, condemns as petty and pretentious. Aruendiel turns Nora out of the house but eventually relents and lets her stay. Dorneng Hul visits Aruendiel's castle to discuss the problem of the Faitoren, and he attempts to remove the wedding ring on Nora's finger, with disastrous results that are only resolved when they place the ring back on her finger. They soon celebrate the Null Days, a sort of nihilistic winter solstice holiday, and Nora cannot shake a strange romantic attraction to Aruendiel. Ilissa tricks Dorneng Hul into releasing Ilissa from her magical barriers. Dorneng Hul, Hirizjahkinis, and Aruendiel set out to recapture Ilissa, leaving Nora and Mrs. Toristel behind. However, a few days after they leave, Hirizjahkinis returns to bring Nora with her, insisting that Aruendiel wants Nora's help. As soon as Nora leaves the safety of the castle, Hirizjahkinis turns out to be Ilissa in disguise, who kidnaps Nora and takes her to a barren, snowy landscape. There Ilissa and Raclin meet with Dorneng Hul, who has been working with Ilissa the entire time. They plan to kill Nora and enslave her spirit, forcing it to hold open a gateway between their world and Nora's world. Nora realizes that when she had read aloud the inscription on the tombstone, she had activated the power of an enslaved spirit in order to travel to this alternate, magical world; but the Faitoren cannot use that spirit, because an iron fence blocks the graveyard and the Faitoren cannot bear the touch of iron. Using a gateway powered by Nora's spirit, the Faitoren would be able to spread to Nora's world and breed as much as they pleased. While Ilissa and Raclin travel back to their realm to prepare, Dorneng Hul loses patience and tries to sacrifice Nora himself. Nora surprises him with a fire spell and then accidentally breaks open a bottle in Dorneng Hul's fur cloak, releasing part of an ice demon that consumes Dorneng Hul's life spirit, though the magician's body remains intact. Nora takes the other bottles from Dorneng Hul's cloak that contain the rest of the ice demon's body and promises to give it back the rest of its body if it guides her to Maarikok, the place where some Faitoren hold Aruendiel prisoner. They journey to Maarikok, and a young man named Perin Pirekenies joins them. Once at Maarikok, Nora releases Aruendiel from a spell that is depriving him of all his magic. As soon as Aruendiel recovers (and kills the ice demon, which was about to eat Nora), they go into battle against the Faitoren and are victorious. However, Ilissa and Raclin escape, and Hirizjahkinis appears to die in battle, though her body is not found. After having defeated the Faitoren, Aruendiel rediscovers the hole between worlds and finds that it still functions. Nora chooses to go home, and Aruendiel and an older wizard named Nansis Abora take her to the portal, and she rejoins her own world. Nora stays at her father's house but, finding that she cannot perform any magic in her own world, considers finding a new gateway back to Aruendiel's world. Characters Nora Fisher ‚Äì an English teacher from New Jersey. Twenty-nine years old when the story begins. Corresponds roughly to Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice. Lord Aruendiel ‚Äì a magician, the third son of Lord Aruen. Died once in battle with the Faitoren, and was revived by other magicians. Bad-tempered and walks with a limp. Approximately one hundred and eighty years old (magicians age more slowly than other people). Corresponds roughly to Fitzwilliam Darcy in Pride and Prejudice. Mrs. Toristel ‚Äì an old woman who cooks and cleans for Aruendiel. Turns out to be Aruendiel's great-great- granddaughter. Perin Pirekenies ‚Äì the captain of the King's guard in Uland. Son of the illegitimate child born by Aruendiel's wife when she had an affair with another man. Eventually proposes to Nora, but she rejects him. Corresponds roughly to George Wickham in Pride and Prejudice. Ilissa ‚Äì ruler of the Faitoren. Expert at illusions and disguises. Mother-in-law of Nora. Hirizjahkinis ‚Äì female wizard who studied with Aruendiel after he rescued her from being executed. Keeps a demon servant called a Kavareen of which Aruendiel disapproves. Development Emily Croy Barker wrote, > The original inspiration was, frankly, a daydream I had about a women who is > enchanted--partly because she doesn't believe in magic and doesn't know > what's happening to her...and then almost immediately I imagined a second > character, a strange, wild-haired figure, telling her that she has to snap > out of this enchanted dream. And I could tell that he was a magician...and > when I started wondering why he was trying to help her, I realized that both > of these figures had stories to tell. So I started writing! She also wrote, \\"I didn't travel specifically to do research, but I found my imagination was stimulated by trips to Maine and to France...where a couple of my friends were living in a small village in Brittany, about five miles away from a castle that in my mind became Aruendiel's castle, or close to it.\\" When asked about Nora's character, Barker explained, \\"She's not based on any particular person, but she does remind me of myself and some of my friends when we were in our 20s and weren't quite sure we were on the right path in terms of the careers that we'd chosen.\\" Nora Fisher dislikes the novel Pride and Prejudice; however, Barker has stated \\"I have to disagree with my character there. I'm a huge fan and have reread it more than once.\\" She chose that novel because \\"it reflects the emotional situation between Nora and Aruendiel without mirroring it exactly... I considered Jane Eyre for the same reason but its plot seemed too close to mine in some ways.\\" Reception Genevieve Valentine of NPR considered Nora \\"remarkably clueless\\" for a scholar, and claimed that \\"Barker's prose style lacks much punch or insight,\\" but still praised the novel as \\"solidly-plotted.\\" Jeffrey Wendler, of the Newark Examiner, wrote, \\"There may have been a good novel lurking here, but it was just too long and slow to come out and the author has another agenda. Barker wants to expose the unjust way women are treated in medieval times.\\" Barbara Steinhauser of the Denver Examiner criticized the novel's implication that Nora's intelligence distinguished the novel from others of the same genre: \\"I also find myself flushing at the claim that this book somehow offers an alternative to other magical novels with female protagonists, in that Nora is intelligent. I have yet to read a magical novel featuring a dumb female protagonist.\\" Nonetheless, she admitted that \\"Barker's novel draws its readers in...I find myself awaiting Emily Croy Barker's next release.\\" Barker read from her book and signed copies of it at the Saint Paul's Episcopal Church. She also did so at the Clinton Book Shop. The novel was a finalist for the Locus Award for Best First Novel.

In representing Asian stereotypes, the album includes digital traditional Chinese and Japanese-styled drum kits and synth presets alongside \\"scrambled\\" ancient Chinese poems. One of the main inspirations for Qadiri producing Asiatisch was the making of a \\"nonsense Mandarin\\" a cappella version of the song \\"Nothing Compares 2 U\\" that would later be the record's opening track. Critical reviews of Asiatisch were generally positive, and the album was on numerous year-end lists by publications, such as being number ten on The Wire's list of the best releases of 2014. However, the LP's use of a concept about stereotypes was a frequent criticism; some reviewers felt the concept had little depth or clarity and the record was much more enjoyable to listen when only focusing on its musical aspect, and some writers felt the concept was better executed than the actual quality of the tracks. History A \\"nonsense Mandarin\\" a cappella version of \\"Nothing Compares 2 U\\" by Sinead O'Connor is on Asiatisch. Fatima Al Qadiri was inspired to produce Asiatisch by her experience in a Chinese Literature college classCliff, Aimee (2 May 2014). \\"Fatima Al Qadiri's Chinese fantasy\\" . Dazed. Retrieved 25 September 2017. and the making of what would later become the LP's opening track \\"Shanzhai (For Shanzhai Biennial).\\" In regards to her time studying in the Chinese college class, Qadiri explained, \\"Even though it was in translation, even though it was taught in an American university by an American professor... I was fascinated by his method, because he really inserted you in Ancient China. It was like virtual reality poetry or something. I think that was the first (time I was) conscious of something other than the West creating.\\" In regards to making the album's opener, she was asked by a group of friends in the art trio Shanzhai Biennial to make, in their words, a \\"cheap, Chinese instrumental\\" under a \\"nonsense Mandarin\\" a capella recording of the song \\"Nothing Compares 2 U\\" by Sinead O'Connor. Recorded by Chinese punk vocalist Helen Feng, the rendition was to be played in a show at MoMA PS1. An instrumental was produced in a manner that did not follow the instructions of the trio, and was not included in the show, but made an appearance as the album's first song; \\"Shanzhai (For Shanzhai Biennial).\\" Overall, it took Qadiri around a month and a half to finish Asiatisch.

Concept As Dusted magazine stated, Asiatisch is an \\"abstract collage of faux Chinese imagery\\" that executes a \\"mixture of caricature, dream and stereotype, with very little of anything actually Chinese filtering through.\\" Asiatisch is about what The Guardian journalist Sukhdev Sandhu described as a \\"themepark simulation\\" or a \\"sci-fi wonderland\\" of China, which Qadiri named \\"Imagined China.\\" \\"Imagined China\\" is an environment of stereotypes about Asian nations and culture that were formed by the Western world, both in education and media formats such as films, literature, animation, comic books, and magazines like The Economist. Qadiri said that \\"The Asia in Asiatisch is a nexus of stereotypes that have been perpetrated, elaborated, embellished and weaved, each time further and further dislocated from the original misrepresentation.\\" Qadiri also stated that the environment of the album's Chinese setting consists of brutalist architecture: \\"There's something very dainty and delicate about my melodic compositions, but they are made by digital tools, which also render them clunky, cold.\\" Some parts of Asiatisch do represent actual Chinese places. \\"Shenzhen\\" and \\"Shanghai Freeway\\" have sounds that replicate the fast architectural modernization and population growth of China, \\"Wudang\\" includes what Andrew Ryce described as \\"disembodied\\" voices and synthesizers suggesting myths about the Wudang Mountains, and \\"Forbidden City\\" \\"reconciles its namesake's imperial history with its current status as a glitzy tourist destination,\\" wrote Ryce. The track \\"Szechuan\\" is titled after the \\"colonial\\" name of the Chinese provence Sichuan, which is used in several Chinese restaurants across the globe. As she described what the song is about, \\"There‚Äôs this idea that Chinese food in China is different than the Chinese food that you find in the West. There‚Äôs an illusion‚Äîyou know what Chinese food tastes like, but then when you go to China, you‚Äôre shocked. You come to terms with reality.\\" \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" includes a modulated voice saying \\"speak Chinese, if you please,\\" a response to the line \\"we are Siamese, if you please\\" from \\"The Siamese Cat Song\\" of Lady and the Tramp (1955).Kretowicz, Steph (6 May 2014). \\"Album of the Week: Fatima Al Qadiri ‚Äì ‚ÄòAsiatisch‚Äô\\" .

Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland Official Website. Retrieved 23 September 2017. He explained that the record is about \\"the ways in which vague notions of China as a cultural monolith and an economic superpower are disseminated through media and how the country acts as the subject of projected of hopes, fears, and dreams in Western culture.\\" Comparing the concept of the album to Edward Said's theories of orientalism, Sandhu stated that Asiatisch is about \\"nations as mythologies, as fantasies, as erratic aggregations of commerce, junk-media, fabricated fictions.\\" Writer Steph Kretowicz stated the message on Asiatisch is nonsensical in a similar manner to most propaganda. Composition The album presents Asian melodies through the lens of a western musical genre, that being grime. Primarily, Asiatisch is a sinogrime album; Hyperdub's Kode9 coined the phrase \\"sino grime\\" to describe a style of grime that heavily contained elements of Asian music. The album commentates on the use of Asian melodies in Western music that originated in the era of Looney Tunes shorts and similar media, where leitmotifs were composed to mimic Asian people, most prominently the Oriental riff. The stereotypes of Asian culture are presented via electronically-produced voices and drums, and \\"scrambled\\" readings of ancient Chinese-language poems on the songs \\"Loading Beijing,\\" \\"Wudang,\\" and \\"Jade Stairs,\\"\\"Asiatisch: .about\\" . Fatima Al Qadiri Official Website. Retrieved 23 September 2017. and the changes in mood \\"between cheesy, eerie and darkly erotic,\\" wrote Sandhu. Sounds on the album include the \\"Asian Kit\\" from Logic Pro and the Asian flute sounds on a Korg M1. As Qadiri explained the scrambled poetry, \\"Imagined China is a scrambled idea. It's not something that you can easily even encompass in a sentence or two - or three, or four. It's an undertaking.\\" As Nick Neyland of Pitchfork analyzed, the structures of the instrumentals are \\"so bare it feels like someone scooped out most of the contents and dumped them out, providing an intriguing counterpoint to the dense flood of thought the record carries on its back\\": while a fair amount of the record includes \\"glassy\\" synth pads, there are also some moments that consist of only little more than bass or trap-style snares. As Neyland wrote, \\"Journalist Dan Hancox described sinogrime as a subgenre ‚Äúthat barely ever existed‚Äù, which is fitting because Al Qadiri also makes music that barely exists, to the point where the gaps between notes almost become the songs themselves.\\" A review published in Dusted magazine, give a more specific description of the arrangement of the songs: \\"Most of the tracks have a sort of lopsided gait, neither propulsive nor minimal but somewhere in-between. The abortive lurches are used as counterpoints to the other sounds, as opposed to building blocks for a foundation. When this is not the case, as on the moody ‚ÄúShenzhen,‚Äù the pace is always somewhat sedate, as opposed to the hyperactivity of ‚Äúregular‚Äù grime, as if Al Qadiri is trying to channel a sort of Eastern mysticism.\\" Reception According to Crack magazine, Asiatisch was \\"one of underground electronic music‚Äôs most intriguing stories of 2014.\\"\\"Albums of the Year 2014\\" .

Neyland praised the \\"immaculate emptiness\\" of Asiatisch, which helped \\"bolster the pervading sense of dislocation of being exposed to a society that‚Äôs been fed through the photocopier one too many times.\\" However, he was mixed towards the fact that the album is \\"only a political record in a faint sense, making few overt statements.\\" He also wrote that \\"it‚Äôs not always so easy to trace Al Qadiri‚Äôs intentions, and the largely dynamic-free range she operates in can grate at times.\\" Similarly, Ryce criticized the lack of depth of the album's commentary towards Chinese stereotypes, also stating that \\"at some level it could be considered offensive, dressing up surface-level appropriation as something smarter.\\" However he opined that, without taking the concept into consideration, Asiatisch was \\"killer\\" as an experimental grime album. A reviewer for The Quietus felt that, while the LP is a \\"pleasurable and an intelligent take on sinogrime,\\" it \\"doesn't offer a corrective of Western cultural mimicry, only an accurate simulation of it, and for that reason is vulnerable to some of the criticisms it sets out to make.\\"Bychawski, Adam (6 May 2014). \\"Fatima Al Qadiri: Asiatisch\\".

Prior to development of the park the area was a landfill site for household waste, which closed in 1994. The park now rises above the river and surrounding area with panoramic views over the south of the city. History and development The area was originally known as Penarth Moors, a marshy area in an extreme meander of the River Ely. In 1971 the River Ely was straightened with a new cut which isolated the old river bed. Cardiff City Council used the old river bed to dump municipal waste. Landfilling of commercial and household waste continued until 1994 by which time the site contained four million cubic metres of rubbish. The 1,100 hectare site subsequently passed into the hands of Cardiff Bay Development Corporation, who created a new retail park on the old industrial site to the east. The refuse site was covered, restored and developed to create Grangemoor Park, completed in 2000. The name was chosen following a local competition. The park includes extensive natural grasslands, a pond, artwork and a picnic area. Wildlife A variety of butterflies and insects, as well as nesting birds (including skylarks) can be found in the park. Two species of newt live in the pond at the lowest part of the site. 850 slow worms were relocated from nearby Ferry Road to Grangemore Park in 2006 to allow a housing development to go ahead. The long grasses and small bushes were ideal habitat and the slow worms subsequently settled in the park. Grangemoor Park is a designated Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC). Artwork \\"Silent Links\\" A large sculpture consisting of giant steel chain links was created at the highest point of the park in 2000. Called \\"Silent Links\\", it was designed by sculptor Ian Randall. In 2016, Grangemoor Park was chosen as the location for a new International Language Monument. Work began on its construction in early November 2018, and it was expected to be completed by the middle of January 2019.

Today the area has been redeveloped, with the building's courtyard converted into restaurants and gift shops. History The exact date of the site's construction is unknown as well as its original purpose, however estimates suggest it was built some time between 1175 and 1350 and contained a moat with high embankments. Sir Hugh Hulse and his wife Marjory are recorded as the hall's first occupants with documents showing the granting of permission for the construction of a tower on 11 February 1398. In 1432, the estate was inherited by the Troutbeck family, with Sir William Troutbeck occupying Brimstage Hall and later dying in the War of the Roses. In 2014 the site was redeveloped into a shopping area and now includes a series of shops, restaurants and a maize maze. Cheshire Cat In a vaulted chamber at the base of the tower, which was possibly used as a chapel, there is a roughly-cut corbel which resembles a smiling cat, although it may actually be a red lion rampant. In his memoirs, Lewis Carroll wrote that he \\"saw a Cheshire cat with a gigantic smile at Brimstage carved into the wall\\".

With Gerhard Ebeling he was a leading proponent of a New Hermeneutic theology in the 20th century. Life Ernst Fuchs was born in Heilbronn on 11 June 1903Zum Lebenslauf vgl.

His student years at T√ºbingen (1922‚Äì24, 1925‚Äì27) and Marburg (1924‚Äì25, 1927‚Äì29) during the heyday of dialectical theology were indelibly stamped by the theology of Karl Barth, the philosophy of M. Heidegger, and the NT studies of R. Bultmann, under whom he received his doctorate at Marburg in 1929.(1999) Dictionary of Biblical Interpretation, R.N. Soulen, \\"Ernst Fuchs\\", by John Hayes, 422-423 New hermeneutic Fuchs' concern is not to ask for the meaning of the text, but to learn how to listen to unobtrusive language about human beings' existence according to the hermeneutical help given with the texts itself.Ernst Fuchs, Briefe an Gerhard Ebeling, in: Festschrift aaO 48. (Sinn des \\"Textes gefragt wird, sondern ‚Äûnach der mit dem Text selbst gegebenen hermeneutischen Hilfe\\") This is the New Hermeneutic. Fuchs' achievement lay in bringing the insights of Karl Barth, Rudolf Bultmann, and Martin Heidegger into fruitful conjunction. He sought to bridge Barth's Calvinist emphasis on the revealed Word of God with Rudolf Bultmann's Lutheran emphasis on the nature of human existence before God by employing a phenomenology of language derived in part from Heidegger's later position, arguing that both human existence and the bring of God are ultimately linguistic-made available in language - and that theology is thus properly \\"faith's doctrine of language\\" (Sprachlehre des Glaubens). Theology's task is essentially hermeneutical, i.t., theology translates Scripture into contemporary terms and contemporary existence into scriptural terms. Fuchs' interests is language event with existential philosophy. Conversely, the reality of God's love is verbalized in Jesus' word and deeds recorded in the Gospels and is thus preserved as language gain (Sprachgewinn). In the freedom of proclamation God's presence in the gospel and the \\"Yes of love: happens again - that is, comes to be as language, opening up the future to authentic existence (faith, hope, and love).(1999) Dictionary of Biblical Interpretation, R.N.

Ernest Fuchs' doctrine of language helped to inspire a \\"new quest\\" of the historical Jesus because it could now be said that Jesus' words and deeds constituted that \\"language event\\" (sprachereignisse) in which faith first entered into language, thereby becoming available as an existential possibility within language, the \\"house of being\\" (Heidegger).(1999) Dictionary of Biblical Interpretation, R.N.

They teach that religion \\"combines an objective, nonarbitrary basis for public morality with respect for the dignity and autonomy of each individual\\" and thus \\"balances the need for public order with a respect for individual liberty\\". Since the time that the first president of the United States, George Washington, wrote a notable letter to the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) affirming their right to conscientious objection with regard to war, \\"the accommodationist position has been dominant in U.S. law and public culture\\". It has also advocated by many social conservatives of many political orientations, such as Christian democratic political parties. Accommodationism stands in tension with the judicial interpretation of separation of church and state, and the constitutionality of various government practices with respect to religion is a topic of active debate. Both principles arise from interpretations of the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  History  In his role as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, General George Washington acknowledged a day of \\"fasting, humiliation and prayer\\" proclaimed by the Continental Congress to be held on Thursday, May 6, 1779. To enable his soldiers to observe the day, Washington ordered a one-day cessation of recreation and \\"unnecessary labor\\". Historians Mark Noll and Luke E. Harlow write that accommodationism was the view held by the Founding Fathers of the United States: Alexis de Tocqueville noted that most Christian denominations produce similar political effects in society: In light of this broad consensus, many political scientists have noted that religion legitimizes political authority. Accommodationism also opines that \\"there is a common set of religiously based morals\\" with values such as \\"chastity, honesty, charity, and frugality [which are] ultimately regarded as having a religious basis, but are common to virtually all religious traditions\\". Richard John Neuhaus likewise stated that religion provides a \\"sacred canopy\\" under which political activity can occur, stating: In light of what accommodationists see as the ethical dimension of religion, especially that of the Judeo-Christian tradition, in the United States \\"accommodationists tend to take a very narrow view of the establishment clause, arguing that this clause only requires nonpreferentialism\\". In contrast to Tocqueville's view, different Christian denominations have taken opposing views on moral issues which have been the basis for law, such as slavery, contraception, abortion, Christianity and homosexuality, capital punishment, and war. Some of these disputes break down into the Christian right vs. Christian left. Christian libertarianism is directly opposed to the use of state power to support religious beliefs.  Policy  A quarter dollar with the United States' official motto \\"In God We Trust\\" on the obverse side Accommodationism advocates providing aid to parochial schools, school vouchers that provide tax credit for private/parochial schools, as well as nonsectarian school prayer, as long as these policies apply equally to all religious institutions and individuals. In contrast to those advocating laicity, accommodationists view the expression of one's religious faith in the public sphere as a human right, such as the wearing of a cross necklace or headcovering, for example. In the United States, religious-based federal holidays and observances, including the National Day of Prayer and Thanksgiving, as well as Christmas, exist based on accommodationist principles. Accommodationism also is seen in the national anthem since 1931, in the Pledge of Allegiance since 1954, and in the official motto of the United States since 1956, In God We Trust, as well as in the judicial oath So help me God as early as 1789. Notably, William O. Douglas, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, sounded the \\"clarion call for accommodation\\" when he stated in his ruling: In the United States, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled with an accommodationist outcome in Everson v. Board of Education, Zorach v. Clauson, McGowan v. Maryland, Epperson v. Arkansas, Board of Education v. Allen, Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York, Tilton v. Richardson, Roemer v.

Freedom From Religion Foundation, among others.  Politics  In the United States, organizations that promote accommodationism include The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, Foundation for Moral Law, Lord's Day Alliance, Alliance Defending Freedom, Christian Coalition, Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and the First Liberty Institute. Socially conservative political parties such as the Republican Party, Constitution Party, and American Solidarity Party espouse accommodationism. Organizations that have argued against accommodationist policies in the United States include Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the Ayn Rand Institute, the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, People for the American Way, and the Secular Coalition for America.

Formed in 1759 it was converted in 1853 to an Artillery Militia unit, which was eventually disbanded in 1909. History The Militia Act of 1757 established militia regiments for each county and required each parish to provide a number of able-bodied men, aged between 18 and 50 (reduced to 45 in 1762) for military training. Militia regiments served in Britain or Ireland but not overseas. Men had to serve for three years (for five years after 1786). As well as the East Suffolk Militia, the county also raised the West Suffolk Militia.* Litchfield, Norman E H, 1987. The Militia Artillery 1852-1909, The Sherwood Press, Nottingham, p.130 In 1831 the East Suffolk Militia became the East Suffolk Light Infantry Militia. In May 1853 the Militia was reorganised with the East Suffolk being converted into an Artillery unit.* Litchfield, Norman E H, 1987. The Militia Artillery 1852-1909, The Sherwood Press, Nottingham, p.130 The Corps of Artillery was designated The Suffolk Artillery Militia and had its headquarters at Ipswich. The unit had a purpose built artillery barracks in Ipswich which were completed in 1855.New Artillery Militia Barracks, Illustrated London News, 17 February 1855 The first commanding officer was Colonel Robert A Shafto Adair MP, who later became Robert Adair, 1st Baron Waveney. The unit was embodied during the Crimean War (1855-6), the Indian Mutiny (1859-1860) and during the South African War (1900) but never served overseas. By 1893 the War Office Mobilisation Scheme had allocated the Suffolk Militia Artillery Volunteers to the Harwich fixed defences.Mobilization Tables for Home Defence, List of Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteer Units, HMSO, London, 1893 The unit was redesignated as The Suffolk Royal Garrison Artillery (Militia) in 1902. It was transferred to the Special Reserve Royal Field Artillery in 1908 on the formation of the Territorial Force and disbanded the following year.

Butler was known for her landscape paintings of New Zealand and her works are held in the collections of the Canterbury Society of Arts Gallery and Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TƒÅmaki.  Early life and family  Born Grace Ellen Cumming, in 1886, Richmond Grove, Invercargill, she was the daughter Scottish immigrants, Jane Cameron and William Forbes Cumming, a carter and contractor. Following the death of her father in 1889 her family moved to the North Island and she attended the Norsewood School, where her eldest sister worked as a teacher. She married Guy Raphael Butler, a law clerk from Poverty Bay, in Gisborne on 1 March 1911 and they settled in Christchurch. The couple went on to have three daughters.  Education  From around 1903 until 1907 Butler attended the Napier Technical School and studied art. She also worked at the school as a teacher. In 1910 she enrolled in the Canterbury College School of Art (now Ilam School of Fine Arts) where she studied until 1914. In her first year at the college she was awarded the Advanced Art Scholarship. During her time at the college she studied under Sydney Thompson, Leonard Booth, Cecil Kelly, and Richard Wallwork. Throughout her life Butler continued to be influenced by Sydney Thompson, attending his classes in 1923‚Äì1925.  Career  In 1915 Butler became a working member of the Canterbury Society of Arts and began to exhibit regularly with New Zealand art societies. As well as the Canterbury Society of Arts she exhibited with the Auckland Society of Arts, New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts, Otago Art Society, and The Group (1934). Butler regularly exhibited with the exhibited Canterbury Society of Arts until 1960. Works by Butler were included in the London British Empire Exhibition in London (1924) and the New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition, taking place in Dunedin, 1925 ‚Äì 1926. In 1916 and 1920 the Canterbury Society of Arts acquired two of her landscapes for its permanent collection. Works by Butler are also held at the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TƒÅmaki including Glaciers, Rolleston Mountains (presented to the museum in 1922), Bush Trees, Lake Kanieri, and Governor's Bay. Other notable works by Butler include Summertime, Arthur's Pass (c. 1945).  Landscape painting  Butler became well known for her landscapes. The critic James Shelley praised her work saying, \\"No artist in New Zealand had quite the same sympathy with our alpine scenery\\" and fellow painter Olivia Spencer Bower saw her as, \\"one of the first women who bothered about New Zealand scenery.\\" Many of her landscapes were of the area around Otira. She first traveled to the region in 1916 and then visited regularly after she and her husband purchased a cabin at Arthur's Pass. Butler was committed to the en plein air method and often worked in adverse conditions at remote sites. The relation of light to tone and colour were key elements in her landscapes. From the late 1920s she was increasingly influenced by the work of the impressionists and her painting style became freer and looser.

Situated to the south of Kennington Park, it was built in 1958 by the London County Council, to designs by Edward Hollamby and Roger Westman. History The estate is named after Thomas Brandon, a gardener, who obtained permission by Act of Parliament to let land within (Walworth) manor on building leases for 99 years in 1774.Cap 43, 14 Geo 3 The estate's initial development included six 18-storey towers (at the time, the tallest in London, helping the development achieve the required density of 136 persons per acre), a new square and other lower buildings, and the rehabilitation of some Victorian terraces. Reclining Figure No. 3 by Henry Moore The estate also features a large mural by Tony Hollaway, commissioned by Hollamby, commemorating the Chartists' meeting at Kennington Common on 10 April 1848. In late 1962, a statue, Two Piece Reclining Figure No.3 1961, by Henry Moore, was purchased by LCC and installed on the estate. Initially placed on a high plinth, it was repositioned on a sloping lawn site in 1989 to make it more accessible. The sculpture is Grade II listed. Critical reaction At the beginning of the development, tenants who had moved from worse accommodation found the estate an improvement on their previous accommodation. The Architects' Journal said the scheme was \\"an important essay by the LCC to create a community in the true sense of the word rather than a mere housing estate. The diversification of design, although it has sometimes degenerated into inconsistency, reflects the provision for a wide variety of social activities‚Ä¶ This is a positive attempt to overcome a major failure of much inter-war housing in the London area.\\" The combination of towers, low- rise blocks and refurbished terraces meant, according to Nikolaus Pevsner, \\"most of the buildings blend successfully into the surrounding urban fabric\\". The poet John Betjeman commented that the estate was \\"attractive, habitable by modern standards, and probably the beginning of a general raising of the self- respect of the neighbourhood.\\" Later history By the end of the 1970s, the estate started to become more socially problematic, with new waves of families arriving from other slum clearances and the council prioritising more disadvantaged people and immigrant communities. The local press carried headlines such as: ‚ÄòVandal-hit estate goes to war‚Äô, ‚ÄòCorridors of Fear‚Äô, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs revolting! Slum estate tenants in new protest‚Äô. There is a Southwark blue plaque on one of the estate buildings, honouring the Crystal Palace, Arsenal and England footballer Kenny Sansom. In popular culture The sitcom 15 Storeys High used the estate as a backdrop for the exterior locations. It has also been featured in the TV shows Spooks, Silent Witness and The Bill.https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/09/14/insideout_190907_feature.shtml The sci-fi series Doctor Who used the estate as the location of the fictional Powell Estate, home of the Doctor's companion Rose Tyler (played by Billie Piper) for several series. Some scenes in the film For Queen and Country were shot at Hanworth House on the estate. Video of the estate from the early 1960s are held by the Brandon Estate Cine Club, which \\"made Super 8 films of events on the estate organised by the social club ‚Äì using a camera bought by 17-year old Brian Waterman with his first pay-packet from his job on the Underground\\".

Early life and education  David Galton was educated at Highgate School London and graduated from University College London in 1957 with a BSc (first class honours) and MB.BS (with honours in medicine) in 1960. After house-staff training he went to the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda Maryland, USA to study with Robert Scow and Martin Rodbell.  Career  On returning to the UK he obtained a Fellowship at the Hammersmith Hospital to work with Russell Fraser and later elected to the consultant staff at St Bartholomew's Hospital London. He was then elected to a Professorship, Department of Medicine, London University and is now an Emeritus Professor at London University. Galton was elected Chairman of Clinical Science from 1978 to 1980. He served on the scientific grants committee of Diabetes UK from 1984 to 1987 and again from 1989 to 1991. He was elected secretary of the European Atherosclerosis Society from 1988 to 1993 and Chairman of HEART UK from 1999 to 2001.

Many more such defects have subsequently come to light particularly to deregulate pathways in early neoplasia. Abnormalities in the covalent modification of peptide regulators were found to have effects on enzyme activity. Thus one extra sialyl residue on apolipoprotein C3 impairs its action on lipoprotein lipase. This can affect expression of the resulting phenotype of hypertriglyceridemia. His laboratory was one of the first to use single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to reveal susceptibility genes that predispose individuals to develop metabolic disorders, such as hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerosis. This led eventually to the development of Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) where more than 1400 susceptibility loci have now been identified using SNPs and some have led to useful therapeutic agents such as volanesorsen  Awards  * Travelling Research Fellowship from the Mental Health Research Fund 1960 * Doctor of Medicine London University 1967. * Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians, London 1975. * Fellowship of the Royal College of Ophthalmology UK 1976. * Erasmus European Professorship 1991. * Doctor of Science London University 1992. * Jephcott Fellowship of the Royal Society of Medicine London UK 1994. * Tempus Professorship of the European Union 1996 and 1997.

Life  Poser was born as Lydia Orban into a working-class family in Heidersbach, now a part of Suhl. After completing her studies at Volksschule and Lyceum, she trained for work as a typist and took a job with a Jena engineering business. In 1925 she joined the Young Communist League of Germany and became an employee of the local Communist Party office in Jena and Erfurt. From 1927 to 1930, she was chair of the Young Communist working group for Jena, and officially joined the Communist Party in 1929. Following the Nazi seizure of power, she was detained and placed in protective custody for anti- fascist activities. From November to December 1933 she was in the district court jail in Weimar, and was then transferred to the Bad Sulza concentration camp. In April 1934, she was convicted by the Superior Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht) in Jena of \\"preparation for high treason\\" and transferred to the women's prison in Gr√§fentonna. She was released in April 1936 and, from 1937 to 1941 worked once again as a typist and from 1941 to 1945 as a cashier. After the war, she again became an official for the Communist Party and a member of the party leadership in Jena, now within the Soviet occupation zone. Poser actively encouraged the merger of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, as both she and her husband had worked in worked in solidarity with SPD members in opposing the Nazi regime.Lydia Poser: Im illegalen Kampf √ºberwanden wir das Trennende.

It served in the disastrous Norwegian Campaign in 1940 and then defended East Anglia during the Battle of Britain and The Blitz. It was reorganised to take part in the invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord), but instead was diverted to defending Southern England against V-1 flying bombs (Operation Diver). It was briefly recreated in the postwar Regular Army. Norway Germany invaded Norway on 9 April 1940, and British and French forces launched a hastily-planned and badly-executed operation to intervene. Because the bulk of Britain's Regular Army had already deployed to France, most of the troops available for the Norwegian Campaign were part-time soldiers of the Territorial Army (TA). After a failed attempt to seize Trondheim, the main Allied objective became the port of Narvik. A base was established on the island of Harstad just outside Narvikfjord, and an airstrip at Sk√•nland on the opposite coast, with an anti-aircraft (AA) allocation of light (LAA) and heavy (HAA) guns of the Royal Artillery (RA). 6th Anti-Aircraft Brigade HQ was assembled in March under the command of Brigadier F.N.C. Rossiter and sent to coordinate the AA defence of these bases.Farndale, p. 27.Frederick, pp. 1048‚Äì52.Routledge, p. 110. Order of Battle Royal Artillery Bofors gun and crew at Harstad, 14 May 1940. By early May, 6 AA Bde had the following order of battle:Derry, Appendix B, p. 267.Farndale, Annex C.Joslen, p. 461. * 51st (London) HAA Regiment (TA)Litchfield, p. 163. ** 151, 152, 153 HAA Batteries (23 x 3.7-inch guns) * 82nd (Essex) HAA Rgt (TA)Litchfield, p. 71. ** 156, 193, 256 HAA Btys, (24 x 3.7-inch) * 55th (Devon) LAA Rgt (TA)Litchfield, p. 43.55 LAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. ** 163, 164, 165 LAA Btys, (36 x Bofors 40 mm guns) * 56th (East Lancashire) LAA Rgt (TA)Litchfield, p. 116.56 LAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. **157 LAA Bty only (10 x Bofors) * 3rd LAA Bty (Regular) (10 x Bofors) (later under command of 56th LAA Rgt) * No 10 Army Observer Unit All these units were short of their establishment of men, instruments and vehicles. Deployment On 14 May the General Officer Commanding (GOC), Lieutenant-General Claude Auchinleck, told London that he needed 104 x 3.7-inch guns and 96 x 40mm to hold Narvik and Troms√∏, the latter having been added to the commitments. The Chiefs of Staff allowed him only 48 HAA and 72 LAA guns. 6 AA Brigade HQ therefore allocated its force as follows: * Harstad/Sk√•nland: 24 HAA and 18 LAA guns (from 51 HAA and 55 LAA Rgts) * Bardufoss airfield: 8 HAA and 12 LAA guns (a Bty of 82 HAA and Trps from 3 and 55 LAA) * Troms√∏ and S√∏rreisa: 8 HAA and 12 LAA guns (a Bty of 82 HAA and 167/56 LAA Bty) * Supporting French force at Gratangen: 12 LAA guns (Trps of 3, 163, 165 LAA Btys) * Bod√∏ force: 8 HAA and 14 LAA guns (from 51 HAA and 55 LAA Rgts) This deployment was gradually carried out during May, with some adjustments. 153/51st HAA Bty intended for Bod√∏ was embarked but never sailed. Two troops of 40mm guns were sent to the blocking force at Mosj√∏en, but one was later withdrawn. All movements had to be carried our along steep narrow roads banked with six feet of snow, or on boats that could not take a 3.7-inch gun. On 9 May, for example, 3rd LAA Bty had its HQ and two guns at Harstad, two guns at Skaanstad, two struggling up the mountains to Bardufoss, and a troop of four fighting off dive-bombers attacking the French at Gratangen ‚Äì a total spread of 80 miles of land and water. The campaign Damage at Harstad after a German air raid. As soon as the brigade was deployed its units were in action as the Luftwaffe made almost daily attacks on shipping in the fjord. 152/51st HAA Battery reported firing barrages, and on one occasion fired for four hours continuously. The Luftwaffe concentrated its air attacks on the AA defences: the Troop of 164/55th LAA Bty at Mosj√∏en fought its way back overland, with the loss of two of its guns to air attack. As soon as 40 mm positions were detected, the Luftwaffe bombers flew higher, while fighters picked off the AA guns. With high mountains and low cloud, early warning cover was poor, with just a single RAF radar post on the Lofoten Islands, and the Army AA units had to rely on information from radar-equipped warships, which provided most of the AA cover in Narvikfjord.Routledge, p. 111. A Bofors Troop of 55th LAA Rgt re-embarked for Mo with 24 Guards Brigade and on landing moved to Stein to block the German forces coming from the south to relieve Narvik. The Germans attacked on 17 May but the little force held. Over succeeding days, however, it was forced back and eventually evacuated from Bod√∏ on 31 May.Farndale, p. 28. The Allies launched an attack at Narvik on 17 May by French, Polish and Norwegian troops, supported by British artillery, including Troops of 3rd LAA Bty and 55th LAA Rgt. The guns of 2 Trp, 3 LAA Bty under French control played a major part in breaking up a strong German ground counter-attack, and then shot down an aircraft. The final attack went in on 27 May and the town was secured the following day. However, immediately after its capture, orders were received to destroy the port and evacuate to the UK. (The British Expeditionary Force in France was simultaneously being evacuated from Dunkirk.) To cover the evacuation, AA units were ordered to maintain maximum activity and especially to prevent reconnaissance overflights. At the same time, 6 AA Bde was ordered by London to recover its 3.7-inch and 40mm guns as a matter of priority. This was done by progressively thinning out defences. The Bod√∏ force was evacuated at night by naval destroyers after a 100-plus German air raid destroyed the town and airstrip: all equipment there had to be abandoned. However, 6 AA Bde was able to assemble from the outlying positions 22 Bofors and five HAA guns at Harstad, with a number of predictors and heightfinders. 55th LAA Regiment saved all its Bofors guns. 6 AA Brigade ended all AA defence on 6 June. By 8 June the British troops had embarked with their surviving equipment and the convoy sailed for the UK, still under air attack.Routledge, p. 112. Battle of Britain On return from Norway, 6 AA Bde HQ joined Anti-Aircraft Command, the predominantly TA force charged with air defence of the United Kingdom. On 29 June Brigade HQ was ordered to proceed to RAF Debden. Initially it was assigned to 2 AA Division covering East Anglia and the East Midlands. On 4 July it was given command of 32nd (7th London) AA Battalion,Planck, pp. 230‚Äì1. a Royal Engineers (RE) searchlight (S/L) unit transferred from 41 (London) AA Bde, and 49th LAA Regiment, RA,49 LAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. which was newly forming. Shortly afterwards the brigade was transferred to the command of 6 AA Division and gained two regiments from that formation: 12th (Finsbury Rifles) LAA RegimentLitchfield, p. 168.12 LAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. from 56 Light AA Bde and 33rd (St Pancras) AA Bn.Sainbsury, Chapter 5. From now on, 6 AA Bde operated as a light AA formation in southern East Anglia, commanding widely spaced S/L sites and LAA guns scattered at vulnerable points (VPs), mainly RAF airfields.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396.Sainsbury, pp. 134‚Äì5. In August 1940, the AA Bns of the Royal Engineers were transferred to the Royal Artillery, when they were designated Searchlight (S/L) Regiments.Litchfield, p. 5. The Luftwaffe began massed raids against RAF fighter airfields in August (the Battle of Britain), but these were mainly in South East England, outside 6 AA Bde's area of responsibility. However, RAF Debden itself was heavily attacked on 26 and 31 August, resulting in heavy damage. In September the attacks shifted to London.Routledge, pp. 383‚Äì6. The Blitz As the battle continued into the night bombing of The Blitz, the brigade's S/L batteries deployed across East Anglia frequently engaged enemy bombers crossing to raid London and the industrial Midlands, and developed cooperation with RAF Night fighter units operating from Debden. The S/L layouts had been based on a spacing of 3500 yards (3200 m), but due to equipment shortages this had to be extended to 6000 yards (5500 m) by September 1940. In November this was changed to clusters of three lights to improve illumination, but this meant that the clusters had to be spaced 10,400 yards (9500 m) apart. The cluster system was an attempt to improve the chances of picking up enemy bombers and keeping them illuminated for engagement by AA guns or night fighters. Eventually, one light in each cluster was to be equipped with Searchlight Control (SLC) radar and act as 'master light', but the radar equipment was still in short supply and did not make its appearance until April 1941.Routledge, pp. 388-9, 393.Sainsbury, p. 137. 6 AA Divisional sign.

Newly formed units joined AA Command, the HAA and supporting units increasingly being 'mixed' ones into which women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) were integrated. At the same time, experienced units were posted away for service overseas. This led to a continual turnover of units, which accelerated in 1942 with the preparations for Operation Torch and the need to transfer AA units from North West England to counter the Baedeker Blitz and Luftwaffe hit-and-run attacks against South Coast towns.Routledge, pp. 399‚Äì404. The widespread introduction of SLC permitted the 'declustering' of the S/L units into 'Indicator Belts' of lights at 10,400 yard spacing and 'Killer Belts' at 6000 yard spacing cooperating with night fighters.Routledge, p. 399.Sainsbury, pp. 140‚Äì42.

The reorganised brigade now formed part of the field force being trained for the Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). It consisted of two mobile HAA regiments: 121st HAA Rgt returned to its command and it was joined by 110th HAA Rgt (345, 346, 354 HAA Btys) and had 3 Composite LAA/SL Bty attached.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 18 February 1943, with amendments, TNA files WO 212/9 and WO 33/1987. When field force AA units and formations were not engaged in mobile training, they were loaned back to AA Command for Home Defence. In March 1944, 102 AA Bde joined 3 AA Group in AA Command in South West England, moving back to 2 AA Group in South East England the following month.Order of Battle of AA Command, 1 August 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/84.

Operation Diver Shortly after Operation Overlord began on D-Day, the Germans began launching V-1 flying bombs, codenamed 'Divers', against London. These presented AA Command's biggest challenge since the Blitz. Defences had been planned against this new form of attack (Operation Diver), but it presented a severe problem for AA guns, and after two weeks' experience AA Command carried out a major reorganisation, stripping guns from the Midlands and repositioning them along the South Coast to target V-1s coming in over the English Channel. In July 1944, 102 AA Bde was among the formations sent to reinforce the AA defences along the South East coast. The brigade HQ was responsible for one of the six sectors of a new belt of anti- Diver defences under 2 AA Group.Pile's despatch.Routledge, pp. 408‚Äì19.

In addition, the brigade's Mixed Signal Office Section comprised 1 officer, 5 male other ranks and 19 ATS, which was formally part of the Group signal unit AA Command Organisation Table, October‚ÄìNovember 1944, TNA file WO 212/148. A Nissen hut being erected at an AA site, November 1944. As the V-1 launching sites in Northern France were overrun by 21st Army Group, the Luftwaffe began air-launching V-1s from the North Sea, and further AA units had to be repositioned along the East Coast. AA Command formed a new 9 AA Group to control the units in East Anglia, and 102 AA Bde came under its command in December 1944. New HAA sites had to be quickly established, with static guns mounted on ingenious 'Pile Platforms' (named after the commander of AA Command, Sir Frederick Pile) and thousands of huts moved and re-erected to shelter the crews as winter approached. During the winter of 1944‚Äì45, the Belgian cities of Brussels and Antwerp were bombarded with V-1s, and a number of Mixed HAA regiments were stripped from AA Command and sent to provide anti- Diver defences. At the end of 1944 the Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious aerial attacks on the UK could be discounted. At the same time 21st Army Group fighting in North West Europe was suffering a severe manpower shortage, particularly among the infantry. Large numbers of AA gunners and whole units were converted into infantry, and the strength of AA Command dwindled.Ellis, pp. 141‚Äì2, 369, 380. By February 1945, the brigade only had 119th HAA Rgt, 140th HAA Rgt (418, 420, 429 HAA Btys) and 129th LAA Rgt under command. In March March, 119th HAA Rgt went to 26 AA Bde and was replaced by 157th HAA Rgt (415, 430, 438 HAA Btys). In April 129th LAA left and was replaced by the return of 19th LAA Rgt. After VE Day, AA Command was rapidly run down, and both 9 AA Group and 102 AA Bde quickly disappeared from the order of battle. 102 AA Brigade was disbanded at Orsett on 3 June 1945. Postwar AA Command's formation badge At the end of World War II, AA Command drew up a 10-year plan for the air defence of the UK. This included a reformed 6 AA Bde based at Brentwood, Essex in 1 AA Group covering London, Thames, Medway, Harwich and Dover, formed on 1 January 1947 from the following Regular Army units from 26th (London) AA Bde (which reformed in the TA as 52nd AA Bde):Routledge, Table LXXIV, p. 441.Watson, TA 1947 * 57th HAA Rgt (the wartime 20th Anti-Tank Rgt) at Orsett Camp, Grays, Essex (5.25-inch guns)53‚Äì59 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. ** 104, 108, 160, 204 HAA Btys * 100th HAA Rgt (the wartime 162nd HAA Rgt) at Grays100‚Äì110 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onwards. ** 259, 281, 317 HAA Btys * 107th HAA Rgt (the wartime 153rd HAA Rgt) at Grays ** 301, 307, 311 HAA Btys * 30 Fire Control Troop However, the 1947 plan was never fully implemented and 100th and 107th HAA Rgts were disbanded during 1948. 6 AA Brigade was placed in suspended animation at Brentwood, Essex, on 31 October 1955, and formally disbanded on 31 December 1957.

She taught at both universities and art schools, and is known for initiating projects linking Internet activism and sailing with the Sailing for Geeks project. She also co-organised the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in 1984. She died at home of breast cancer.  Education  After graduating with a Bachelor of Art degree at the University of Nanterre, Paris X, she continued her studies in the United States and obtained a Master of Fine Arts at the Visual Studies Workshop in Rochester, New York, where she met Catherine Lord, Mario Biagioli, Skuta Helgason and Lisa Bloom. She obtained a Qualifying Exam at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she met Teresa de Lauretis, who was working in the Women Studies department. In History of Consciousness, she met James Clifford and Donna Haraway, who took her as her assistant.  Teaching  She started her teaching career as lecturer at the University of California, Northridge and Chapman University in Orange, where she taught an introductory class on photography during the 1984‚Äì85 school year. She was assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz from 1986 to 1990, where she taught media studies, cultural studies and the history of photography. Upon returning to France, she sought to share her American experiences in her teachings, films, publications and events that she organised and participated in. University of Paris VIII. In 1998 she became a full professor at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d'art in Dijon. In 2007, Paul Devautour invited her to come teach at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d'art in Bourges, where she taught until 2012. One of her classes entitled, Genre, which she gave in association with Giovanna Zapperi, was thought of as a space for pedagogical innovations within which she organised a lecture series with C. Lord, Paul Preciado, Shu Lea Chang, Yann Beauvais, Patrick Cardon.... In 2012, she invited A-LI-CE6 (Claire Fristot) to give a VJing workshop. She established links and exchanges with Luang Prabang (Entr'√©coles, 2008 and 2010) and with the University of California in Irvine (CRUde1 in the US and CRUde2 in France). In Bourges, she created collaborations with Emmetrop and also with Bandits Mages. Her teachings focus on the analysis and critique of media on a feminist, queer and postcolonial point of view. More than transmitting knowledge, she wants to create a method, a trans-disciplinary process that leads to the conquest of autonomy.  Media theory  A media theorist and activist, she published two books translated from English and German into French : La Vid√©o : entre art et communication, followed by Connexions : arts, r√©seaux, m√©dias, with Annick Bureaud. She managed the French distribution lists Nettime and CEDAR, the coordination of all French art schools. Nathalie Magnan took part in a number of events of all kind, related to several parts of her expertise. In 2000, Isea, the international symposium on electronic arts, was organized in Paris. Not a single woman was invited. A hundred women met at Ensba on Nathalie Magnan's initiative and were welcomed by Mathilde Ferrer - together, they held an Isea counter-event. Every woman had 5 minutes to talk about her work. This is the first time that these women gained some public notoriety.  Activism   Public access television  In the USA, she took part in public access televisions and tactical media. She made several movies with the collectives Paper Tiger Television and Deep Dish TV, including The Gringo in Ma√±analand.  Cyberfeminism  Magnan is one of the French pioneers of cyberfeminism. She created the website Cyberf√©minismes.org. In 1999, she was invited to the Canalweb show Les P√©n√©lopes, to talk about cyberfeminism. In 2000, she organised the ISEA off event in Paris. The same year, she took part in the creation of a women's TV show for the local Aubervilliers television, called SixSex, as well as a show on the dangers of tampons on women. In 2001, she was part of the Very Cyberfeminist International festival in Hamburg. In 2002, she translated and published the Cyborg Manifesto by Donna Haraway, which she then published in 2007. She organized a presentation of women artists active in the digital world, Openmic cyberfem, at the Maison des M√©tallos, and organized Gender Changer Academy workshops for ZELIG: a week of workshops, demos, meetings, and debates on the subject of communication, networks, open source software and Internet activism. She created the Chiennes de Garde website and managed this feminist online forum until June 21, 2003. In 2008, she organized the Femmes et R√©seaux (Women and Networks) meeting in Paris with Isabelle Arvers and Anne Roquigny. She talked about Feminism and Cyberfem at the Master of Advanced Studies of the Zurich University of the Arts in 2009, and in March 2010 in Paris. On March 7‚Äì8, 2015, she was part of the Wikipedia Art+Feminism Editathon, in Paris. On June 6, she talked about tactical media during Performing Opposition in Aubervilliers.  Sailing for Geeks  Nathalie Magnan invented the concept of Sailing for geeks, combining cybertechnologies and the rigorous logic of sailing. Sailing for geeks 1 is held in Finland, at Isea 2004, and Sailing for geeks 2, in 2005, lead people to explore sailing conditions in the Gibraltar detroit, to meet people trying to escape the Moroccan coast and come to Europe. Her last public interventions are held in 2015. On November 21, 2015, she talked about Blackmarket for Useful knowledge and Non Knowledge at the Mus√©e de l'Homme.  Gay and lesbian activism  Nathalie Magnan was a co-organiser of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in 1984. In the 1990s, she took part in the New Queer Cinema festival at the Paris American Center. In 1994, she co-founded the Paris Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, and she was its president in 2001 and 2002. In December 1995, she joined Lesborama to come to the Lille festival Questions de genre ‚Äì 100 ans de cin√©ma gai et lesbien ‚Äì 10 ans de pr√©vention, which is the first Gay Night at Canal+. In 1992, she wrote for the periodical Gai Pied.

His images of the city of Galveston, Texas, constitute a valuable record of the town between 1885 and 1907, especially its devastation by the hurricane of 1900. Biography Julius Stockfleth was born in Wyk auf F√∂hr in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. He was the son of Louise (Hansen) Stockfleth and Friedrich August Stockfleth, a sailor and ship's carpenter. After an apprenticeship with a local painter, he emigrated to the United States in 1883, settling in Galveston in 1885. During the two decades that Stockfleth lived in Galveston, he frequently painted the city's docks, its harbor, and its ships. He found a good market for this work among the ships' crews. The 1900 hurricane killed a dozen members of his extended family, and as a way to cope with the tragedy he undertook a series of paintings that documented the city during the hurricane and its subsequent rebuilding. His are the only known contemporary paintings of the Galveston hurricane. Altogether, Stockfleth left some 100 paintings of Texas subjects painted in a na√Øve realist style. He returned to Germany in 1907, living in Wyk until his death and painting local scenes. Some of his work is in the collection of the Rosenberg Library.

Along the Fehn Canal runs the so-called Versch√∂nerungsweg. On old maps Bargebur is also called Bergum or Westekelbur.  Geschichte  Nordern's townsfolk refused to allow the reformed Christians to build their church within the then urban area. As a result, the Count of L√ºtetsburg, Dodo II of Innhausen and Knyphausen, allowed them to do so on his territory, which adjoined the municipal boundary. The town of Nordern made the construction of the church more difficult by making raids, which caused material damage, until the reformed Christian, Grand Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg, who had occupied Greetsiel at this time, sent troops there in 1684, who protected the construction. On 1 July 1972, Bargebur, which had belonged to the municipality of L√ºtetsburg until then, was incorporated into the town of Norden.

Reception In the inaugural issue of Ares Magazine, David Ritchie gave the game package a poor score of 2 out of 9, saying, \\"The result is a nicely balanced game which almost succeeds in overcoming the flimsiness of its premise. The two games are playable in one- half to three-quarters of an hour.\\". In the May-June 1980 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 28), Denis Loubet reviewed Annihilator & One World was similarly unimpressed by either game. \\"Oneworld seems to take itself too seriously, and I don't know whether to believe the introduction or not. The counter mix is sort of unbalanced; the fog counters are of little worth, while the blades are the main attacking force... \\"Annihilator is just too small a game; there's not enough there. If there were more and different counters and a more complex and varied map, it might have the popularity of Ogre, but as it stands it's too small.\\".

The reserve offers extensive game-viewing facilities, guided walks, environmental education, and three picnic sites. History Before 1948 the land was used as a labour tenant farm with subsistence crop and livestock farming. Inappropriate practices resulted in severe soil erosion, and in 1948 the farm was expropriated by the Department of Agriculture. This department successfully implemented extensive soil and wetland reclamation measures, including the construction of retaining walls, gabions, rock packs and brush packs and the restriction of grazing. In 1975 the area was proclaimed a nature reserve. Vegetation Vegetation types include Dry Tall Grassveld, Mixed Thornveld and Valley Bushveld. The Dry Tall Grassveld is generally sparse, dominated by Hyparrhenia hirta and encroached by woody species. Vachellia karroo, Vachellia nilotica, Euclea crispa, Euclea racemosa, Olea europaea, Ozoroa paniculosa, Premna mooiensis and Vitex rehmannii are found in the Mixed Thornveld. Rangelands are managed through the strategic use of fire and the control of herbivore numbers; blue wildebeest, impala and warthog were intentionally excluded when the reserve was stocked because their grazing habits can cause soil erosion. Fauna Weenen Game Reserve supports mammals such as black rhinoceros, giraffe, kudu, eland, white rhinoceros, red hartebeest, and zebra; impala and warthog (originally from neighbouring properties) have established populations in the reserve. Other mammal species include hyaena, jackal, bushbuck, reedbuck, steenbok and porcupine. More than 230 species of birds have been recorded. Facilities The game reserve has a small two-bedroom cottage with barbeque facilities and its own trail and waterhole.

From the child whose cheeks are pinched by her Italian family, to the teenager's makeout sessions, from figs (both symbolic and real), to Jayne Mansfield (all too real and yet symbolic), the candid lines of LoSchiavo's Concupiscent Consumption examine the urges of a young woman seeking to define her sexuality as well as her culture.

History  The exact date that the village was founded is unknown.

NGC 4689 is also classified as a LINER galaxy. NGC 4689 is inclined at an angle of about 36¬∞ which means that the galaxy is seen almost face-on to the Earth's line of sight. NGC 4689 was discovered by astronomer William Herschel on April 12, 1784. The galaxy is a member of the Virgo Cluster. Physical characteristics NGC 4689 has ring- like feature in its inner regions. Surrounding the inner ring lies a zone of bright, flocculent spiral structure with a ring-like boundary. Outside this zone is a well-defined, diffuse outer ring which is an unusual feature for a late-type galaxy like NGC 4689. Star Formation The star forming disk in NGC 4689 has been truncated which means that the amount of star formation has been reduced significantly. This truncation may have been caused by an interaction with intracluster medium of the Virgo Cluster causing the galaxy to lose much of its interstellar medium in an effect known as ram-pressure stripping. Due to its reduced amount of star formation, NGC 4689 has been classified as an Anemic galaxy.  Gallery  File:NGC4689 - HST - Potw2007a.jpgA Smudged Fingerprint.
