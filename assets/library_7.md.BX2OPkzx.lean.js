Prior to this, he has competed in the Volkswagen Scirocco R-Cup, Polo Cup, Formula BMW Pacific and the 24 hours of Nurburgring.  Early career  Aditya was given his first taste of motorsport in a Go-Kart at the age of four. He began participating in local Go-Karting events at the age of eleven. Although in school, his parents Kamlesh Patel (former Indian racing and rally champion) and Amita Patel were instrumental in showing support in his early career. His first national title came in 2001 when he won the Jk Tyre Junior Karting championship in Goa. Patel continued to pursue racing as well as academics while trying to strike a balance between the two. It was only in 2007, in his final year of high school, that he won the National racing championship in Single seaters for the NK Racing team owned by Narain Karthikeyan as well Rotax Max India challenge and went on to represent the country in the Rotax world finals held in Al-Ain.  International career  Patel's international career began with a bang, notching up a third-place finish on his debut in the Formula BMW Pacific Championship in 2008. After a year of racing in Asia, Aditya was given an offer to race in the Volkswagen Polo cup in Germany, which he accepted due to budget constraints in Single Seater racing. From there on he continued to race in tin-tops in the Scirocco R Cup in Germany with two wins and two podium finishes to his name. In 2012 Patel was signed by Audi India and raced the 24 hours of Nurburgring in an Audi TT for Pro Handicap ev (with teammates Oliver Rudolf and Wolfgang Muller) and won in the SP4T category. He was then given a drive in the JK Racing Asia series where he notched up four Podium finishes and a Win, becoming the first Indian to climb on the podium and win an International event at the Buddh International Circuit. Aditya participated in the ADAC GT Masters series in Germany with Team MS Racing in an Audi R8 LMS. The series in widely accepted by drivers and teams as one on the most competitive GT Series' in the world today. He was joined in the car by Daniel Dobistch who has been racing in the series for three years now. Together they made considerable progress and had a few top ten finishes over a span of 16 races in 8 weekends. In 2014, Aditya had a successful year with Team Novadriver alongside teammate, Cesar Campanico in the International GT Open Series. The duo finished on the podium a total of five times through the year, which included a win at Jerez, and stood 6th overall in the GT3 category. Aditya also had his best GT3 qualifying in Silverstone where he qualified on Pole position. 2015 saw Aditya make a move into the Asian motorsport scene by entering the Audi R8 LMS Cup with team Audi China. After a successful beginning to the season, Aditya entered the halfway mark in the lead of the driver's standings. However, after a couple of tough weekends, capped off the season with a win in the final race and ended fourth in the overall standings. Aditya participated in the Audi R8 LMS Cup once again in 2016 with team Audi China finishing 6th in the overall driver's standings.  Blancpain GT Series Asia  Aditya's foray into the Blancpain GT Series Asia began with a commanding win at the Sepang International circuit. Partnering Malaysian driver, Mitch Gilbert, Aditya put in a string of performances finishing on the podium eight times out of twelve races in 2017 which included three wins. A huge tyre blowout saw a sure win being snatched away from them at the third round of the championship in Suzuka. The duo then fought back over the course of the season but however lost the driver's championship to Hunter Abbott by a single point. X1 Racing In 2019, with fellow Indian driver, Armaan Ebrahim, Aditya created the X1 Racing, the world's first professional franchise-based motorsport league.

Many neurological systems are cholinergic. Cholinergic neurons provide the primary source of acetylcholine to the cerebral cortex, and promote cortical activation during both wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep. The cholinergic system of neurons has been a main focus of research in aging and neural degradation, specifically as it relates to Alzheimer's disease. The dysfunction and loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and their cortical projections are among the earliest pathological events in Alzheimer's disease. Neuromuscular junction using acetylcholine as the neurotransmitter  Anatomy Most research involving cholinergic neurons involves the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. However, cholinergic neurons only represent about 5% of the total basal forebrain cell population. Most of these neurons originate in different areas of the basal forebrain and have extensive projections into almost all layers of the cortex. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are homologous within a particular basal forebrain region but vary across different regions. In the brainstem acetylcholine originates from the pedunculopontine nucleus and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus collectively known as the meso-pontine tegmental area or pontomesencephalotegmental complex. Normal aging Normal aging is described as aging unaccompanied by the behavioral or cognitive dysfunctions associated with the cholinergic basal forebrain system. In normal aging, there are beadlike swellings within the cholinergic fibers with enlarged or thickened axons, often in grape-like clusters. This fiber swelling can be induced in a laboratory setting by damaging the cell body of the cholinergic neuron, which implies there is a slow cell and fiber degeneration of affected neurons and their projecting axons. Neuroprotective effects Nerve growth factor protects cholinergic neurons. The small non-toxic molecule urea has no neuroprotective effect on cholinergic neurons by itself, but when experimental brain slices were treated with nerve growth factor and urea, the number of cholinergic neurons in the brain slices was significantly enhanced when compared to slices treated with nerve growth factor only. The enhancing effect of urea may be due to inhibition of the nitric oxide-system within the cholinergic neuron.  Relationship to mammalian circadian system Cholinergic neurons, along with non-cholinergic neurons, have sleep/wake regulatory functions in the basal forebrain that can be categorized based on their firing patterns in different regions. The cholinergic system allows the circadian system to have the cycle of one day. The cholinergic neuron may also play a role in time memory, and the ability of an individual to form a memory around a certain time of day, which is known as \\"time stamping\\". The cholinergic system is characterized by high acetylcholine release during the active phase of an individual‚Äôs circadian rhythm. = Firing patterns and the circadian system= In the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca's area of the brain, cholinergic neurons have very low firing rates during both wake and non-REM sleep, and show no rhythmic bursts during hippocampal (theta) Electroencephalography activity. However, cholinergic neurons in the magnocellular preoptic nucleus and Substantia innominata have increased firing rates with fast cortical (gamma) Electroencephalography activity during wake and rapid eye movement sleep. This indicates that cholinergic neurons may be activated through Œ±1-receptors by noradrenaline, which were released by locus coeruleus neurons during wake cycles. In a basic summary, cholinergic neurons are always active during wake or rapid eye movement sleep cycles, and are more likely to activate the cerebral cortex to induce the gamma wave and Theta rhythm activities while behaviorally promoting the states of wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep. =Time memory and time stamping= The suprachiasmatic nucleus functions as the hypothalamic master clock, controlling the body's Circadian rhythm. The suprachiamatic nucleus of mice, hamsters, and rats have a small amount of cholinergic innervation. A \\"time memory\\" is the memory at a specific time of day for which an individual made an association with a certain event or location. \\"Time stamping\\" is the process by which the specific time-of-day is encoded to support the formation of a time memory. The situation must be important and specific, without unnecessary prolonging, for a time stamp to occur. Acetylcholine excites cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, so cholinergic transmission of more Acetylcholine into the suprachiasmatic nucleus should support the formation of a time memory. The number of free and available muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) is highest when acetylcholine release is at the lowest levels. When a memorable event occurs, there is a massive release of acetylcholine that will attach to mAChRs. Once too many are involved, the mAChRs will reduce or block further cholinergic input, which protects these cells and the networks from additional cholinergic input that could disrupt the signal. This allows the suprachiasmatic nucleus to perform time stamping and produce a time memory of what has just occurred to the individual. If correct, this would explain the cholinergic neuron‚Äôs role in memory. =Circadian system and Alzheimer's disease= The circadian system is one of the first systems to be damaged in Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's patients often complain of disrupted sleep, shortened rapid eye movement sleep, and increased night time awakening. These disruptions steadily worsen as the disease progresses. It is normal in aging for circadian rhythms to deteriorate as choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) fluctuations change in pattern and acetylcholine levels fluctuate more often. As Alzheimer's disease drastically changes cholinergic function, the circadian system naturally follows the changed levels. Circadian rhythmicity in acetylcholine release is critical for optimal memory processing, and a loss of this rhythmicity contributes to cognitive problems in Alzheimer's disease. =Olfactory behavior= Circadian modulation of cholinergic neuronal could be important for mediating sexual behaviors in mice. Modifications of basal forebrain cholinergic neuronal activity disrupted odor discrimination of simple odors, and the investigation of social odors.  Neurological disorders Degeneration of the cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain has been linked to progressing memory deficits related to aging, which eventually results in decreased cholinergic function. The dysfunction and loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons has been observed in many dementias, especially Alzheimer's. Recent findings imply that aging-related cognitive deficits are due to impairments of cholinergic function rather than cholinergic cell loss. This suggests that it will be possible to reverse cognitive declines, as the cells are not dead, but deteriorating. = Alzheimer's disease= Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The proportion of deaths associated with Alzheimer's continues to grow rapidly, increasing by 66% from 2000 to 2008. Alzheimer's typically involves a decline in the activity of choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase, as well as a decline in acetylcholine release. Cholinergic system research may provide the key to treating and reversing this devastating disease. Histological hallmarks Although degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic cells has been observed in many other dementias, Alzheimer's has two distinctive histological hallmarks: Beta amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The Beta amyloid plaques are high-molecular weight fibrils and are major components of the senile Alzheimer's disease brain. There appears to be a vast, intrinsic microvascular pathology of the brain in these cases, which suggests a link between Beta amyloid production, impairments in cerebrovascular function, and basal forebrain cholinergic deficits in AD. It appears that Beta amyloid (1-42) mediates its cytotoxic action by affecting key proteins that play a role in apoptosis induction. There is also evidence that shows beta amyloid proteins actually bind to cholinergic neurons and physically inhibit ChAT activity in cultures treated with oligomers of beta amyloid. The other histological hallmarks, neurofibrillary tangles, are the intracellular inclusions formed by aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. This is found only in select populations of patients with Alzheimer's. This tau protein has specific pathology, and has been found both in patients with mild cognitive impairment (a forerunner of Alzheimer's) and Alzheimer's itself. The neurofibrillary tangles seem to increase within the basal forebrain cholinergic complex with old age and at a more accelerated pace in patients with Alzheimer's. Probable cause for vulnerable cholinergic neurons The \\"cholinergic hypothesis\\" is a well-established pathology of the involvement of cholinergic neurons on Alzheimer's disease due to their role in memory. Research in 2007 determined why cholinergic neurons were becoming more vulnerable to Beta amyloid plaque formation. A pathway exists for both the maturation and degradation of Nerve Growth Factor, which causes cholinergic neurons to become vulnerable. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are highly dependent on the constant internal supply of Nerve Growth Factor throughout life. If the supply of Nerve Growth Factor is interrupted, cholinergic atrophy could begin to occur in these neurons and change their phenotype. This supply could be interrupted if there is a failure in the protease cascade and the precursor proNGF cannot be converted to Nerve Growth Factor. This is caused by a rise in matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity, which increases the degradation of Nerve Growth Factor and reduces its production. This double failure of Nerve Growth Factor stimulation leads to the progressive atrophy of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, which in turn contributes to Alzheimer's-related learning and memory declines. Disease model Most studies of Alzheimer's have used mice or rat brains with Beta amyloid plaque buildup as the disease model. In 2013, Dr. Su-Chun Zhang and his research team derived cholinergic neurons from neuroepithelial stem cells in a laboratory setting, making it easier to test potential treatments without the use of live animals. Potential treatments Potential treatments for Alzheimer's include the use of memantine, a moderate affinity uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist that preferentially blocks excessive N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity without disrupting normal activity. This treatment is based on the theory that degenerative neural disorders have excitotoxic processes due to the inappropriate overstimulation of the NMDA receptor. In a rat model, memantine treatment given preventatively to certain rats pre-Œ≤-amyloid (1-42) lesion significantly reduced the loss of cholinergic fibers. Memantine treatment reversed attention and learning deficits in Beta amyloid (1-42) affected rats. This data indicates the ability of memantine to rescue neocortical cholinergic fibers (originating from basal forebrain cholinergic neurons) from the neurotoxic effects of Beta amyloid (1-42) oligomers. It should also be noted that memantine is able to inhibit the truncation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (triggered by activated calpain), which is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's, affecting tau phosphorylation (the second histological hallmark). Another treatment involves the use of exogenous choline acetyltransferase as supplementation in cholinergic neurons. Cholinergic neurons have significantly reduced choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholine activity, which is correlated to the severity of the dementia or cognitive impairments. The problem with this therapy is that choline acetyltransferase is largely blocked by the blood-brain barrier. PTD-ChAT is a fusion protein made up of both protein transduction domain and choline acetyltransferase; it can pass through the blood-brain barrier and cell membranes. It regulates acetylcholine levels in the brain, curing mice treated with PTD-ChAT from their memory and cognitive deficits. =Other potential diseases= Cholinergic neurons have an effect on other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Down syndrome. As with Alzheimer's, the degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and the decrease in the neurotransmitter acetylcholine have a drastic effect on behavioral and cognitive function.

It was completed in the 1950s combining the historic front gable from another site with the more recent architecture of the remainder of the building.  History  In 1755, Johann Georg Hoffschlaeger, a wine merchant and city counsellor, had a house built on a site now designated as No. 31B, An der Schlachte. The stonemason Theophilus Wilhelm Frese (1696‚Äì1763) decorated the fa√ßade in the Rococo style, with a bow window and a gable topped with a wig. In 1836, the building was bought by Georg Friedrich Pfl√ºger who used it as an inn named Stadt Paris (City of Paris). In 1875, the property was taken over by Carl Wilhelm Meyer, a publicly appointed sampler. In the early 20th century, a new building designed by Albert Dunkel maintained the Rococo fa√ßade. The building was destroyed in the second world war by an airstrike with incendiary bombs in 1944. Rudolf Stein, who later became Bremen's monument conservator, saved some of the debris including the fa√ßade. In 1957/58, the building was reconstructed on a new site on the corner of Langenstra√üe and Marktplatz. After a call for tenders, it was designed by the architect Eberhard Gildemeister (1897‚Äì1978) assisted by the sculptors Maria Ewel and Ingeborg Ahner-Siese. They used original building elements from the fa√ßade of the Schlachte building, adhering to the original style. Eberhard successfully combined the building's red- bricked lateral walls with the historic fa√ßade. The interior, however, was finished essentially in the style of the 1950s. A notable design feature is the new door with a skylight on the market side. The internal decoration, too, contains many Baroque elements. Today, the building houses a branch office of the Sparkasse, a municipal savings bank.  Heritage listing  In 1973, the building was listed as a historic monument.

He was the founding director of the Burgenland Landesmuseum in Eisenstadt, Austria and throughout his life remained a committed advocate for this region and its people. Being Jewish, he was removed from his job as a public servant immediately following the Anschluss and fled to Britain with his young family. In 1949 Barb joined the Warburg Institute, ultimately becoming Librarian and publishing extensively in both English and German. Family and education The son of Moriz Barb, an engineer in the Austro-Hungarian army, and Henrietta Schrenzel, Barb was born in Vienna, the second of four children. His grandfathers were Isaac Barb and D. H. Schrenzel from Galicia (now Ukraine), both notable for their roles in the revival of the Hebrew language during the mid 19th century. A student at the University of Vienna, he was obliged to put his studies on hold to support his family by working as a goldsmith. Under the tutelage of Wilhelm Kubitschek, he finally received his doctorate at the age of 25 for his thesis on the coinage of Cilicia. During his time at the University, Barb was selected to work on archaeological digs by Adolf Mahr in support of whom he gave testimony after the war during the latter's denazification process. In 1975 Barb was awarded the title of professor and a golden doctor's diploma by the University. Austria and the Anschluss Shortly after receiving his doctorate, Barb was chosen by S√°ndor Wolf, the philanthropist, art collector and wine merchant, to create and manage the Landesmuseum for the Burgenland. In his role as director of the museum he was a tireless advocate for the region's culture, history and environment. However, as was the case for all Jews operating as public servants at the time of the Anschluss, he was dismissed from his post and then required to leave Eisenstadt. With the support of ESG Robinson, then Deputy Keeper of the Coin and Medal Department, British Museum he was given entry to the United Kingdom but following the outbreak of war was interned on the Isle of Man as an enemy alien. He was subsequently released to work as a factory tool-fitter in Leeds, where he remained for a number of years. Warburg Institute In 1949 Barb took up the role of assistant librarian at the Warburg Institute, becoming Librarian in 1956. He worked under a number of directors including E.H. Gombrich and, in addition to his special interest in the Burgenland, continued to publish extensively on the fields of folklore and magic in the ancient world. Following his retirement, he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Institute.

The bill would change reporting requirements about financial data and start a pilot program to research best practices. The bill was introduced in the House during the 113th United States Congress. Background A previous version of the bill () was also sponsored by Rep Issa. It passed in the House during the 112th United States Congress, but did not become law. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2013 would amend the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 to: :*transfer from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to the United States Secretary of the Treasury the responsibility for maintaining the website established by such Act (i.e., USAspending.gov) to provide public information about awards of federal funds; :*require spending data for all federal funds to indicate the appropriation, federal agency, sub-agency, account, program activity, and object class (the category assigned for purposes of the annual budget of the President to the type of property or services purchased by the federal government) for such funds; :*require the Secretary of the Treasury to establish government-wide financial data standards for federal funds; :*require the Director of OMB to review the financial reporting required by federal agencies to consolidate financial reporting and reduce duplicative reporting; :*require the Inspectors General at each federal agency and the Comptroller General to report biennially on the completeness, timeliness, quality, and accuracy of spending data submitted by each agency; :*require the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (Board) to develop and test information technology resources and oversight mechanisms to enhance the transparency of, and detect and remediate waste, fraud, and abuse in, federal spending for Inspectors General; and :*require the Board to maintain a website to inform the public about activities to identify waste, fraud, and abuse in federal spending. The bill would require the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to establish a pilot program relating to reporting by recipients of federal funds to increase financial transparency to: (1) display the full cycle of federal funds, (2) improve the accuracy of federal financial data, and (3) develop recommendations for reducing reporting requirements by consolidating and automating financial reporting requirements across the federal government. The bill would amend the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to terminate on September 30, 2013, reporting requirements relating to the use of funds under such Act, oversight functions of the Board, and the requirement that the Board maintain a public website. The bill would extend the termination date for the Board until September 30, 2017. It would amend the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 to eliminate the Board's responsibility for monitoring the expenditure of funds related to Hurricane Sandy. The bill would require the Director of OMB to make required financial management status reports and government-wide five-year financial management plans available on the OMB website. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on May 22, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 2061 aims to make information on federal expenditures more easily available, accessible, and transparent. The bill would require the U.S. Department of the Treasury to establish common standards for financial data provided by all government agencies and to expand the amount of data that agencies must provide to the government website, USASpending. H.R. 2061 also would authorize the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to continue to operate through 2017 and would direct the board to conduct a three-year pilot program to make it easier for federal contractors and grant recipients to comply with reporting requirements. Finally, the legislation would require the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Government Accountability Office (GAO), and agency Inspectors General (IGs) to submit additional reports to the Congress. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that implementing the bill would cost $395 million over the 2014-2018 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, mostly for collecting and reporting financial information across government agencies. The legislation also could affect direct spending by agencies not funded through annual appropriations; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. The CBO estimated, however, that any net increase in spending by those agencies would not be significant. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues. H.R. 2061 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA); any costs to state, local, or tribal governments would result from complying with conditions for receiving federal assistance. Procedural history The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on May 21, 2013 by Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R, CA-49). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which considered and markedup the bill on May 22, 2013. It was ordered reported (amended) by the committee with a voice vote on May 22, 2013. On November 15,2 013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that the bill would be considered under a suspension of the rules on November 18, 2013. A companion bill, the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (S. 994; 113th Congress), passed in both the House and the Senate. Debate and discussion According to the Data Transparency Coalition, the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2013 \\"will standardize and publish the U.S. government's wide variety of reports and data compilations related to financial management, procurement, and assistance. Better transparency, more effective federal management, and cheaper compliance will be the results.\\" The Coalition argues that the legislation will make it possible for members of the public and watchdog organizations to track taxpayer money as it is appropriated, sent to agencies, and spent. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) wrote a letter supporting provisions of the DATA Act that would amend the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006. They believe the act \\"appropriately specifies a financial data reporting standard that Federal agencies can implement using a currently available nonproprietary computer language. Ultimately, the benefits of using data standards to tag financial data will enhance the accuracy and transparency of financial and performance information.\\" The data standard being discussed was XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language), which AICPA approves of. Trey Hodgkins of TechAmerica published an opinion article about the bill on September 23, 2013, mentioning specific areas his organization felt needed improvement. Those areas included more specificity about who was responsible for certain reports, concerns that \\"a user can identify trends and themes in the data to determine the U.S. government's plans,\\" a lack of legal citation references, and odd timing on the pilot program relative to the other provisions.

The drumming troupe's success then led to the opening of an ice cream store in 2010, which also brings together people from both sides of the genocide.

Originally initiated by the Ford Foundation in 1963, the program has been run by the DAAD ‚Äì with the assistance of the German Federal Foreign Office and the Senate of Berlin ‚Äì since 1965. The program annually invites around 20 artists working within visual arts, literature, music and film to spend a year (in the case of film, six months) living and working in Berlin. It is aimed at artists who have already demonstrated considerable talent, but are yet to become fully established. It is one of the foremost artistic programs in Europe, and has hosted artists, filmmakers and writers such as Steve McQueen, Susan Sontag, John Cage, Margaret Atwood, Asghar Farhadi, Damien Hirst, Nan Goldin, Shahzia Sikander, Chirikure Chirikure and AA Bronson. Katharina Narbutoviƒç is currently head of the program.  History of the Artists-in-Berlin Program  In 1963, a year and a half after the construction of the Berlin Wall, the Ford Foundation created a three-year program aimed at expanding and strengthening the cultural and educational resources of West Berlin. The Foundation made an initial donation of three million US dollars and placed James B. Conant, former president of Harvard University and former United States Ambassador to Germany, in charge. 300,000 and 350,000 dollars respectively were allocated to the creation of two new courses at the Free University of Berlin ‚Äì one in American Studies, and another in Comparative Music Studies. 590,000 dollars were used to make it possible for ‚Äòartists, writers, academics, scientists and composers‚Äô to spend ‚Äòan extended period of time living and working in Berlin.‚Äô In 1965 the DAAD took over the running of the program, and renamed it the Artists-in-Berlin Program. It now gained additional support from the German Federal Foreign Office and the Senate of Berlin. Hansgerd Schulte, president of the DAAD from 1972 to 1987, called it ‚Äòthe jewel in the crown‚Äô ‚Äì a unique entity amongst the many programs run by the DAAD. In 2013, the program is preparing to celebrate its 50th anniversary. This will be marked by a two-day celebration hosted at the Berlin Academy of Art, featuring performances from Antjie Krog, Sj√≤n, Jennifer Walshe and Phil Collins, among others. A 50th anniversary countdown blog has also been created, featuring contributions from various guests about their time in Berlin.  Guests  In essence, the Artists-in-Berlin Program consists of a grant, allowing an artist to spend one year in Berlin. Each year, following the recommendations of a jury, the program awards around 20 grants in the fields of the visual arts, film, literature and music. The program also assists its guests with displaying or performing the work they have produced in Berlin ‚Äìfor visual artists, for instance, individual exhibitions are organized in the program‚Äôs gallery, the daadgalerie, often accompanied by a publication. Since 1964, around 1000 artists have come to Berlin as guests of the program. Between 1963 and 2013, around 394 visual artists have taken part in the program. They include Jorge Castillo (1969), Daniel Spoerri (1973), Joel Fisher (1973), Gunter Christmann (1974), Richard Hamilton (1974), Duane Hanson (1974), Christian Boltanski (1975), Lawrence Weiner (1975), On Kawara (1976), Jannis Kounellis (1980), Nam June Paik (1983), Erwin Wurm (1987), Ilja Kabakow (1989), Nan Goldin (1991), Marina Abramoviƒá (1992), Rachel Whiteread (1992), Damien Hirst (1993), Andrea Zittel (1995), Pipilotti Rist (1996), Douglas Gordon (1997), Allan Sekula (1997), Rineke Dijkstra (1998), Steve McQueen (1999), Mark Wallinger (2001), Mona Hatoum (2003), Helen Mirra (2005), Shahzia Sikander (2007), Tim Lee (2009), Brandt Junceau (2010), and AA Bronson (2013). Due to the extremely high demand for grants in this field, the program no longer takes on applications from individual artists ‚Äì they must instead be sought out and suggested by a committee. In all other fields, potential guests are welcome to apply on their own initiative. The program has also hosted 334 writers. They include the aforementioned Ingeborg Bachmann (1963), Peter Handke (1968), Ernst Jandl (1970), George Tabori (1971), Lars Gustafsson (1972), Friederike Mayr√∂cker (1973), Stanislaw Lem (1977), Gyorgy Konrad (1977), Margaret Atwood (1984), Gao Xingjian (1985), Carlos Fuentes (1988) Susan Sontag (1989), Cees Nooteboom (1989), Antonio Lobo Antunes (1989), Harold Brodkey (1992), Wladimir Sorokin (1992), Imre Kert√©sz (1993), Ryszard Kapuscinski (1994), Richard Ford (1997), Jeffery Eugenides (1999), Laszlo Vegel (2006), Svetlana Alexievich (2011), Liao Yiwu (2012), Erik Lindner (2012), and Lance Olsen (2015). Around 282 composers have received a program grant for music. They include Iannis Xenakis (1963), Igor Stravinsky (1964), Isang Yun (1964), Krzysztof Penderecki (1968), Gyorgy Ligeti (1969), Morton Feldman (1971), John Cage (1972), Arvo P√§rt (1981), Luigi Nono (1986), La Monte Young (1992), Peter Machajd√≠k (1992), Roberto Paci Dal√≤ (1993), Nicolas Collins (1995), Olga Neuwirth (1996) and Giulio Castagnoli (1998). 105 filmmakers, such as Yvonne Rainer (1976), Istvan Szabo (1977), Andrei Tarkowski (1985), Jim Jarmusch (1987), Alina Rudnizkaia (2011), Sebasti√°n Lelio (2012) and Xiaolu Guo (2012) have also participated in the program. The first grant for dance and performance was awarded in 1989, and the program has since welcomed 13 such artists, including Wendy Perron (1992).  The daadgalerie  From the very beginning, the Artists-in-Berlin Program was intended to provide more than just funding and accommodation. Its mission was to connect isolated West Berlin with a wider cultural and creative world. As such, the program coordinators invited guest artists to city events, introduced them to influential figures in the German cultural scene, and ensured that they were able to publicly perform and display their work. To give these activities a concrete physical focus, the daadgalerie was created in 1978, providing the program‚Äôs artists with a set platform for their creative activities. To begin with, it was based in silent film star Henny Porten‚Äôs former villa in the Kurf√ºrstenstra√üe, in what was then West Berlin. However, in 2005 it was moved to new premises in the Zimmerstra√üe, close to Checkpoint Charlie in the centre of Berlin. It continues to host a wide range of events, including readings, concerts, film showings and performances.

Biography =Holocaust= Adam Heller was born in 1933 to Jewish parents in the Romanian city of Cluj (now Cluj-Napoca). In 1944, following the Second Vienna Award, the Hungarian administration confiscated his family's property, and they were forcibly relocated along with more than 18,000 other Jews to the Kolozsv√°r Ghetto within the walls of the Iris Brickyard. In late May of the same year, the prisoners of the ghetto at Kolozsv√°r were transported out of the ghetto as part of the Nazi Final Solution.

The FreeStyle‚Ñ¢ system of TheraSense, a micro-coulometer released in 2000, made the monitoring of blood glucose painless by accurately monitoring the glucose concentration in 300 nanoliters of blood. With more than a billion units produced annually, FreeStyle‚Ñ¢ became the highest impact nanotechnology or micro-fluidic device. The FreeStyle Libre‚Ñ¢ continuous glucose monitoring system of Abbott Diabetes Care, is the world's most widely used diabetes management system and is based on the electrical wiring of enzymes, science and technology of which were created by Heller.Heller, A. and B.

Research His study of the physical chemistry of inorganic oxyhalide solutions resulted in the first neodymium liquid lasers (1964‚Äì1967). It also resulted in one of the earliest lithium batteries, the globally manufactured lithium thionyl chloride battery (1973) used in implanted medical and in defense systems where greater than a 20-year shelf life, high energy density, or operation at any temperature encountered on Earth are required. His studies of photoelectrochemical solar cells resulted in 11.5% efficient solar cells (1980) and in 12% efficient hydrogen evolving photoelectrodes. His related studies with Heinz Gerischer of photoelectrocatalysis established that the rate of photo-assisted oxidation of organic matter on photocatalytic titanium dioxide particles was controlled by the rate of reduction of adsorbed oxygen by trapped electrons. He established the field of electrical wiring of enzymes (1988‚Äì2005), the science and engineering of the transduction of the turnover rates of electron-transferring reactions of enzymes to electrical currents without use of diffusing oxidants or reductants. His study of the electrical wiring of glucose oxidase enables the continuous and bloodless glucose monitoring with subcutaneously implanted sensors. It is the core technology of the FreeStyle Libre‚Ñ¢ system of Abbott Diabetes Care, having a glucose concentration transmitting skin adhered patch that is replaced every two weeks by the user. Unlike earlier monitors, it operates without periodic blood-requiring calibrations.

Wallace attended the University of Texas at Austin where he was a member of the Tejas Club, Texas Cowboys, and the president of the student body.TEXAS BOARD OUSTS UNIVERSITY HEAD: Students March on Capitol to demand Governor call meeting on discharge of Rainey. New York Times Nov 3, 1944, p 38. He led a 1944 protest against the ouster of UT president Homer P. Rainey and graduated in 1947. Wallace was also a student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Columbia University, from September 1947 to May 1948 but did not graduate with a degree. By early August 1951, Wallace was working as an economist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C. while his wife, a draftsman with the Planning Survey Division Texas Department of Transportation, and children lived with his mother in Austin. In October 1951, Wallace was visiting Austin and Dallas while on vacation from his position in Washington. Murder of John Douglas Kinser On October 22, 1951 in Austin, John Douglas Kinser, a 33-year-old sophomore student at the University of Texas, was shot to death in the clubhouse of the Pitch and Putt Golf Course that he operated. Immediately after the first shot, one golfer outside the clubhouse observed a man inside holding a revolver. He heard two or three additional shots after leaving to attract the attention of three other golfers on the course. The three golfers on the course observed the man running from the clubhouse and getting into his car, and one of them noted the car's make and license plate number. The men ran to the clubhouse where they found Kinser's body, then telephoned the police who radioed the car's description and license information to state and city patrol cars. Three patrolmen with the Texas Highway Patrol spotted then stopped the car nine miles from Austin on the Burnet Highway. According to one of the patrolmen, the driver perfectly fit the description provided by the golfers and his shirt was torn and bloodied. The suspect and witness were taken to the headquarters of the Austin Police Department for questioning. Wallace was identified as the man leaving the scene with a snubnosed pistol, and three bullet shells were found near Kinser's body. He was arrested by highway patrolmen on the Burnet Highway shortly after the shooting. Detectives revealed no motive in the killing as Wallace refused to answer their questions. He was charged the following day with murder and the Justice of the peace set bail at $30,000. Two days after the killing, the district attorney accused the local sheriff of \\"obstructing the investigation\\" stating that he had refused to transport Wallace to the Texas Department of Public Safety for identification testing. According to the sheriff, Wallace protested the move and his defense attorney, Polk Shelton, had asked that Wallace not be moved. Wallace was represented at the trial by John Cofer, longtime lawyer to Lyndon Johnson, who had also represented LBJ during his contested election to the United States Senate in 1948 that was tainted by allegations of voter fraud. During the trial, FBI special agent Joseph L. Schott stated that he had known Wallace for 12 years and in 1946 had given Wallace a German-made 6.35 mm Schmeisser automatic pistol that he (Schott) had acquired while serving in the United States Army in Germany. A firearms expert for the Department of Public Safety testified that the slugs and shells from the murder scene could have been fired from the Schmeisser. A chemist/toxicology expert, also with the Department of Public Safety, said that a paraffin test on Wallace's hands tested positive for gunshot residue and that blood on his shirt matched blood found at the club house at the golf course. Testimony was completed on February 25, 1952 and Judge Charles O' Betts recessed court in order to finalize the jury instructions prior to closing arguments. The prosecution did not attempt to establish a motive for the shooting, nor did it produce an eyewitness to it or the murder weapon. The following day, the prosecution and defense completed their closing arguments and the jury was charged that afternoon. After deliberating into the evening, the jury was sequestered within the courthouse dormitory. After listening to 29.5 hours of testimony from 23 different witnesses, on February 27 the jury returned its verdict finding Wallace guilty of \\"murder with malice\\". After a short recess, O' Betts sentenced Wallace to a five-year sentence that was suspended. Questioned as to why the prosecution did not attempt to provide a motive, defense attorney Polk Shelton stated that it was \\"probably because they couldn't.\\" Kinser's sister-in-law later stated that Kinser was killed because he had been having an affair with Wallace's wife. Later life Wallace was the manager of the purchasing department of Ling-Temco-Vought. He attended an Episcopal church in Dallas. On January 7, 1971, Wallace died when his car ran off the road 3.5 miles south of Pittsburg, Texas on U.S. Route 271. Noting that the highway was neither icy nor wet, the investigating patrolman stated that Wallace had struck a bridge abutment after apparently losing control of his car. He was buried in the Nevills Chapel Cemetery in Mount Pleasant. Posthumous allegations In 1984, Billie Sol Estes told a grand jury investigating the 1961 shooting death of Henry Marshall, an official with the Department of Agriculture, that Wallace was his murderer. Estes, who was convicted in 1963 on federal charges related to non- existent fertilizer businesses, said that Marshall possessed information linking Estes' fraudulent schemes to a heavily-funded political slush fund run by Lyndon B. Johnson. According to Estes, he and Johnson discussed the need to stop Marshall from making their illegal ties public. In exchange for immunity from prosecution, Estes was also prepared to provide the United States Department of Justice information of eight killings orchestrated by Johnson, including the assassination of John F. Kennedy. He claimed that Wallace persuaded Jack Ruby to recruit Lee Harvey Oswald and that Wallace fired a shot that struck Kennedy. Glen Sample and Mark Collom implicated Wallace in a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy in their mid-1990s book The Men on the Sixth Floor. According to the authors, Collom met Loy Factor while confined in a hospital isolation ward in 1971 where Factor implicated himself, Wallace, and a woman named \\"Ruth Ann\\" in the assassination of Kennedy. Conspiracy debunker Dave Perry charged the authors of relying upon unreliable witnesses, including Foy, Estes, and Madeleine Duncan Brown. Barr McClellan, author of Blood, Money & Power: How LBJ Killed JFK, reiterated many of Estes claims in 2003 stating that Johnson, Wallace, Estes, and Cliff Carter were responsible for the death of Marshall. According to McClellan, Wallace fired one shot at Kennedy from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, then ran to escape. He stated that fingerprints and an eyewitness placed Wallace in that location and that Wallace could be seen as a \\"shadowy figure\\" in photos of the building. However, author Joan Mellen pointed out in her 2016 book Faustian Bargains that the fingerprint claim has been discredited.http://jfkfacts.org/new-look- lbj-joan-mellen-debunks-mac-wallace-myth/ Roger Stone, author of the 2013 book The Man Who Killed Kennedy: The Case Against LBJ, called Wallace \\"Lyndon Johnson's personal hit man\\" and also said that Wallace shot Kennedy from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. Similar to McClellan's account, Stone said six eyewitnesses placed Wallace in that location and that a fingerprint found on a box in the sniper's nest was his. Expert Robert Garrett, who assisted Mellen in her investigation, stated that the fingerprint image, which was preserved in the National Archives, did not match that of Wallace.

He is chiefly known for his role in the Turgesh wars against the Umayyad Caliphate in Transoxiana, and for being responsible for the murder of Suluk in 738, precipitating the collapse of Turgesh power. After eliminating his rivals, he rose to become khagan himself, but soon fell out with his Chinese backers and was defeated and executed in 744. Some Arabic sources, however, record that he was killed by the Arabs in 739. Origin Along with the khagan himself‚ÄîSuluk Chabish-chor or Su-Lu of the Chinese sources‚ÄîK√ºl-chor, or \\"K≈´r·π£≈´l al-Turqashƒ´\\" in Arabic, is one of only two Turgesh leaders to be mentioned by name in the Arab sources of the period. K√ºl-chor, usually identified with the Baga Tarkhan (pinyin: Mohe dagan quel√º chuo) of Chinese sources, was the leader of a small Turkic tribe, known in the Chinese sources as Chumukun (Â§ÑÊú®ÊòÜ), living south of Lake Balkash between Turgesh and Qarluq lands. Wars against the Arabs K√ºl-chor first appears in spring 721, when, following the calls for aid of the Soghdian princes of Transoxiana against the expansion of the Umayyad Caliphate, he was sent to lead the first Turgesh attack on the Umayyad Arabs. Despite a setback at the fortress of Qasr al-Bahili, K√ºl-chor proceeded to raid deep into Transoxiana, mostly with the aid of the local population and their princes. Samarkand, which was too strong to be assaulted, was bypassed, but when at long last the unwarlike Umayyad governor, Sa'id al-Khudhayna, marched to meet him, K√ºl-chor inflicted a heavy defeat on the Arabs, and forced Sa'id to confine himself in the neighbourhood of Samarkand. Despite their success, however, the whole operation seems to have been, in the words of H.A.R. Gibb, \\"little more than a reconnaissance in force combined with a raiding expedition\\", and the Turgesh withdrew soon after, allowing the new Arab governor, Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi, to brutally suppress the local rebels and re-impose Arab authority on most of the region. K√ºl-chor appears again in the Siege of Kamarja in 729, when he was one of the high-ranking Turgesh hostages given to the Arab garrison of Kamarja as guarantee of safe passage. In December 737, Suluk suffered a personal defeat in the Battle of Kharistan, which greatly diminished his prestige. K√ºl- chor had him assassinated, probably with backing from the Chinese, who had a history of troubled relations with Suluk. As a result, the Turgesh khaganate broke up into two warring factions, the \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Black\\", which struggled for power over the next two decades. The ensuing collapse of Turgesh power meant the disappearance of \\"the last great Turkish confederation in Western Asia for more than two centuries to come\\" (Gibb), leaving the path open for the Arabs to impose their rule on Transoxiana. Usurpation and death K√ºl- chor and his faction allied with the Chinese general Gai Jiayun against Suluk's son and successor, Kut-chor, or Tuhuoxian in Chinese sources. Aided by his Transoxianian allies from Ishkand, Shash and Ferghana, in 739 K√ºl-chor defeated and captured his rival at Suyab. Soon after, K√ºl-chor was acclaimed as khagan and Kut-chor was exiled to China, where he was symbolically put to death in the imperial temple, before being given an honorary commission and allowed to live off his days at the Chinese court. Already from the beginning of his reign, K√ºl-chor's relation with his Chinese overlords was strained, as the Chinese court supported a candidate of its own, Ashina Xin, for the khaganate. In the event, K√ºl-chor drove off Ashina Xin and assumed the khaganate, forcing the Chinese to recognize the fait accompli. Soon however K√ºl-chor broke with the Chinese altogether, and in 742 he had Ashina Xin assassinated. As a result, in 744 the Chinese general Fumeng Lingcha campaigned against K√ºl-chor, defeated and executed him. He was followed by Tumodu, now styled El Etmish Kutlug Bilge.  Aftermath  After this, Turgesh power continued to decline amid internecine warfare, until, in 766, the Qarluqs killed the last Turgesh khagans and supplanted them as masters of the region of Semirechye. Later Arab sources on the other hand attribute K√ºl- chor's capture and execution to the last Umayyad governor of Khurasan, Nasr ibn Sayyar, in 739. Gibb, however, argues that if he is to be identified with Baga Tarkhan, this cannot possibly be true, and that this tale is probably an exaggerated re-telling of the actual capture and execution of another, lesser Turkish leader by Nasr.

Biography Edward was the eldest son of Sir Walter Aston and his second wife Elizabeth, daughter of James Leveson of Lilleshall, Shorpshire. Sir Edward was a wealthy man he had estates in the counties of Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire produced an annual income of ¬£10,000. In the year 1587, Sir Edward Aston was at the head of the commission appointed by Queen Elizabeth I, to examine the letters and seal up the papers and effects of Mary Queen of Scots, who was then a prisoner at Chartley Castle. It was at this time that the Babington Plot for carrying off the Queen of Scots, was discovered. He had intended to surprise her guards and attendants, and to carry her off while she was taking the exercise of riding in the fields between Chartley and Stafford. In 1590, Sir Edward Aston was appointed Sheriff of Staffordshire, an office of honour, and trust, which every one of his ancestors had discharged from the time of King Edward III.

A follower of the ideas of Marcus Garvey, he was associated with \\"black nationalist\\" ideology in the 1950s and 1960s. Early years Lawson was born in Macon, Georgia, studying at high school there, then moving to New York, where he was based for the rest of his career. In the 1930s he participated in the Harlem Labor Union,Obituary, \\"James R. Lawson, 67, Harlem-Based Activist, New York Times, July 14, 1985 founded by Ira Kemp. The organization had a Garveyite black nationalist philosophy, and was opposed by Frank Crosswaith's Negro Labor Committee. United African Nationalist Movement In 1948 Lawson founded the United African Nationalist Movement (UANM), which lobbied for support for anti-Imperialist forces and promoted Pan-Africanism, in the tradition of Garvey. The UANM sponsored events such as Garvey Day in Harlem, a celebration of Garvey's work at which a \\"Miss Africa\\" was crowned.Brenda Gayle Plummer, Rising Wind: Black Americans and U.S. Foreign Affairs, 1935-1960, University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, 1996, p.267. In 1950 Lawson was imprisoned for breaching the peace when he and other UANM members protested at a local Catholic church over the church's alleged support for Italian imperialism dating back to Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia.\\"Lawson draws 60 Days, 5 other pro-Afros jailed\\", The New York World, November 11, 1950, p.7 Lawson also regularly used the proximity of the United Nations headquarters to publicize the cause. According to fellow-activist Ora Mobley-Sweeting, \\"having the United Nations right there in New York city offered us the opportunity to approach this international body\\". Lawson would \\"set up picket lines at the United Nations, speaking out about African liberation.\\"Biondi, Martha, To Stand and Fight: The Struggle for Civil Rights in Postwar New York City, Harvard University Press, June 30, 2009 pp.280-1. The movement promoted links with independent African nations. In March 1957, the UANM held a dinner at the Hotel Theresa in Harlem for the ambassadors of Sudan, Morocco, and Tunisia, along with an envoy from Libya. The UANM opposed US support for European imperialism, such as supplying helicopters to France for use in the Algerian war of independence. Lawson believed that Europe and Africa should receive equal U.S. aid and endorsed more open support for anti-colonial activities. Lawson also wanted to set up a black-diaspora trading company to replace white-owned businesses that operated in South American and Caribbean countries. In the 1959 documentary The Hate That Hate Produced Lawson's activities were linked to those of the Nation of Islam, the principal subject of the program, which addressed the rise of \\"black nationalism\\" in America. He was asked about his relationship with African leaders of the time, notably President Nasser of Egypt. According to commentators Rodolfo Torres and Christopher Kyriakides, this aspect of the program \\"draws public attention to the significant threat that Black Nationalism, as an enemy within, is presumed to pose to American interests in the Middle East\\".Rodolfo Torres, Christopher Kyriakides Race Defaced: Paradigms of Pessimism, Politics of Possibility, Stanford University Press, 2012, p.89. He was also quizzed about his support for politicians Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Hulan Jack. He also defended his links with African leaders; criticized the NAACP because of its integrationist ideology and Jewish leadership; and defended a painting depicting Jesus as a black man, quoting scriptural passages. In 1961 Lawson stated: \\"Mere crumbs from the tables of an abundant society have made millions of black men angry. That's why the black nationalist movement is growing and becoming more militant in New York and everywhere else. We believe that our future must be linked with that of our brothers in Africa.\\" After the killing of Medgar Evers in 1963 he stated that black Americans should \\"arm themselves\\". Family and other activities With his wife Martha, Lawson had two daughters, Kathryn Brown and Mary Birhane Lawson, and two grandchildren. He continued writing and activism into his later years. In the 1980s he campaigned for the legalization of the numbers game, in order to diminish the influence of organized crime.

All three victims were male and died from stab wounds. Their bodies were discovered dumped in ditches outside Peterborough. In Hereford, two other men were stabbed, but survived. The perpetrator was Joanne Christine Dennehy, a Cambridgeshire woman, who was later sentenced to life imprisonment with a whole life order. Victims Kevin Lee was a property developer, landlord and lover of Dennehy. He was killed on 29 March 2013, and his body found the next day near Newborough. Dennehy dressed Lee's body in a black sequined dress before dumping his corpse. Lukasz Slaboszewski met Dennehy through a shared interest in drink and drugs, and John Chapman was a housemate of Dennehy. Slaboszewski, a Polish national, was killed on 19 March, and Chapman on 29 March. They were both found on 3 April near Thorney with stab wounds. After the killings, Dennehy was driven by an accomplice, Gary Stretch, to Hereford where she stabbed two men, chosen separately and at random, both of whom survived. Both men were dog walkers; she stole the second's dog. Another man travelling in the car, unwillingly, was later cleared of criminal involvement in the attacks. Victim selection and motives Dennehy, a 30-year-old absent mother of two young children at the time of the killings, specifically targeted men during her killing spree, telling her acquaintance Lloyd that she did not wish to kill a woman and especially not a woman with children. Mark Lloyd stated Dennehy had wanted to kill nine men in total, seeking to be like Bonnie and Clyde. Dennehy stabbed men for the purpose of \\"entertainment\\", telling Gary Stretch, \\"I want my fun. I need you to get my fun.\\" She later told a psychiatrist that she had found murder to be \\"moreish\\" and that after the first killing she \\"got a taste for it.\\" Court proceedings In November 2013, Dennehy pleaded guilty to all three murders and two further attempted murders. Her sister Maria was unsurprised by the guilty plea and said, \\"I think she did that to control the situation. She likes people to know she's the boss.\\" Dennehy has been held at HM Prison Bronzefield. Assessing psychiatrists later diagnosed Dennehy with psychopathic, anti-social and borderline personality disorders. Two men, Gary Stretch (formerly known as Gary Richards), 47, and Leslie Layton, 36, stood trial charged with a range of crimes assisting Dennehy. Both decided not to give evidence or face cross- examination. The jury began considering their verdicts on 4 February 2014. On 10 February, Richards was found guilty of attempted murder and Layton was found guilty of perverting the course of justice. On 12 February, Layton and Richards were convicted of all other charges. On 28 February 2014, at the Old Bailey, Dennehy was sentenced to life imprisonment. The trial judge, Mr Justice Spencer, recommended that she should never be released due to the premeditation of each murder. Spencer said further that Dennehy was sadomasochistic, and lacked the normal range of human emotions. Dennehy is believed to be one of just three women in the United Kingdom to be given life imprisonment without parole, after Myra Hindley and Rosemary West.Vikram Dodd \\"Joanna Dennehy: serial killer becomes first woman told by judge to die in jail\\" , The Guardian, 28 February 2014 Richards was also sentenced at the Old Bailey alongside Dennehy to life imprisonment with a recommended minimum term of 19 years. Layton was sentenced to a total of 14 years, and Robert Moore, 55, who admitted to assisting an offender, received a three-year prison sentence.The \\"Timeline of police Operation Darcy into murders of three Peterborough men from 2013\\" from the \\"Peterborough Telegraph\\" newspaper lists a timeline of dates, locations and events between March 2013 until February 2014 tracing the murders of Kevin Lee, Lucasz Slaboszewski and John Chapman in Peterborough and the subsequent court case. After the trial After the trial it emerged that the Probation Service was supervising Dennehy at the time of the murders as she had been convicted of assault and owning a dangerous dog. It was later concluded that the staff dealing with her were inexperienced.Joanna Dennehy was on probation at time of murders The GuardianSerial killer Joanna Dennehy was being supervised by probation when she murdered three men Peterborough Telegraph Escape plot While Dennehy was on remand before the trial, prison staff found an escape plot in her diary. This involved killing or seriously injuring a prison guard, cutting off one of the guard's fingers and using the amputated finger to fool the biometric system in the prison. Because of the plot, Dennehy was placed in solitary confinement from September 2013 (before the court proceedings) to September 2015 (after the proceedings). She claims isolation left her 'tearful and upset' and led to self harm. The High Court rejected Dennehy's claim that her human rights had been violated. Government lawyers argued isolation was necessary due to the nature of Dennehy's offences and the risk she could pose to the public if she were to escape. Mr Justice Singh found solitary confinement was \\"in accordance with law (...) at all material times it has been necessary and proportionate\\". At the time, Dennehy was incarcerated in HMP Bronzefield, Surrey.  Imprisonment  In 2018 she launched bid to marry her cellmate Hayley Palmer and received a positive answer from prison authorities, to the dismay of Palmer's family, who feared Dennehy might endanger her. In 2018 both Dennehy and Palmer tried to kill themselves during a suicide pact. In 2019 Dennehy was moved to Low Newton Prison in County Durham. Upon her arrival she threatened to kill Rosemary West, who had been moved to another prison.

Scott Paterson, is a Toronto-based technology and media venture capitalist. In the 1990s, Paterson gained notoriety in the Canadian investment and finance world and served as \\"a prominent technology and media financier\\" during the technology boom in the latter half of the decade. Paterson has been the recipient of Globe & Mail's \\"Top 40 Under 40 Award\\" and, in 2007, was recognized by Newsweek magazine as one of the 17 people in its \\"Who‚Äôs Next in 2007\\" article. An active philanthropist, Paterson co-founded Toronto's Merry Go Round Children's Foundation in 1997 and currently serves as its Chairman. Today, Paterson's business efforts are devoted between leadership roles at Symbility Solutions and Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation.  Early life and education  G. Scott Paterson was raised in Ontario by a single mother who worked as a teacher at Lakeport High School. As a child, Paterson was sparked with an early interest in the stock market when his grandmother one day bought him five shares of Abitibi Paper. As Paterson once recalled, \\"Most of my friends got new bikes for their birthday and, instead, I received a share certificate\\". Paterson got his first job at age nine, which was selling programs at Merrittville Speedway in St. Catharines and Ransomville Speedway. By age twelve, Paterson was writing articles for the programs at Merrittsville and Ransomville Speedways, and by age fifteen, Paterson served as the Assistant Track Announcer for both locations. Paterson attended Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School. He attended Ridley College for grades 12 and 13 with the assistance of school bursaries. Paterson then went on to attend the University of Western Ontario, where he first earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics in 1985, followed by a completion of the university's Executive Program in 1995. Paterson completed his Canadian Securities Course in 1984 and the Canadian securities industry officers and directors designations in 1991. In 1996, Paterson obtained the US Series 7 and Series 24 accreditations, entitling him to sell securities in the United States and to be an officer and director of a United States broker dealer. In 2009, Paterson earned his ICD.d designation after completing the program offered at the Institute of Corporate Directors sponsored by the University of Toronto‚Äôs Rotman School of Management, \\" and earned a Certificate of Entertainment Law at Osgoode Hall, York University in 2014.  Career  = Start in the investment industry = After graduating from university in 1985, Paterson began in the retail brokerage side of the investment world. Starting out as a retail broker at Dominion Securities Pitfield, Paterson became known as the 'cold-call cowboy' and became head of the firm's President's Club, as well as its top broker of those in their first three years in the industry, as measured by commissions earned. After being recruited by the Richardson Greenshields firm in 1987, Paterson landed a position as a senior investment banker at Midland Walwyn Inc , a newly formed brokerage company. It was at Midland where Paterson began to focus his attention as an investor on the technology industry. Paterson was considered the \\"IPO King\\" at Midland, and was considered for the role of head of investment banking when late in 1994, Midland Walwyn President Peter Wallace and his allies attempted to gain control of the company and unseat then Chief Executive Officer, Bob Shultz. This failed and Wallace and others were fired. Veteran banker Bob McLeish was given the head of investment banking role and Paterson began to look for an alternative venue to build a tech-focused boutique brokerage firm. = Yorkton Securities Inc. = In 1995, Paterson was recruited again, this time by Yorkton Securities Inc., a small, independent, mining-focused brokerage house. In his six years at Yorkton, Paterson helped transform the brokerage from a mining firm to a knowledge industries firm that targeted technology, internet, film and television, and biotechnology as their industries of focus. Paterson also helped build out Yorkton's retail presence to $3 billion in assets and helped take total firm revenue to $244 million in 2001, with a pre-tax profit of $56 million. Paterson was promoted at the company and, in October 1998, at the age of 34, Paterson became Yorkton's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Paterson served as Chairman of Yorkton from 1998 until December 2001. As Chairman, Paterson pulled the company into \\"tech stocks just in time for the Silicon Valley gold rush of the late '90s.\\"  Controversy at Yorkton Securities Inc.  In March 2000, the Vancouver Sun reported that Yorkton had played multiple roles as investor, promoter and underwriter of a tech start-up known as Book4Golf.com Corp. This action raised questions about conflicts of interest for the firm and in December 2001, Paterson left Yorkton Securities. This incident was considered to be the reason for Paterson's departure. In relation to the Book4Golf.com incident Paterson reached a settlement agreement with the Ontario Securities Commission for investor conduct that the Commission believed was against public interest. As part of the agreement, Paterson was asked to pay $1.1 million Canadian dollars to the Commission and was barred from trading for six months. This settlement came despite the OSC stating Paterson never breached any securities laws. The OSC head of enforcement Michael Watson said \\"the information before the commission on which Paterson settled did not involve the breach of securities law. Paterson was not involved with insider trading.\\" Paterson fulfilled all parts of the settlement agreement.  Current career interests  Paterson currently divides his time and energy between leadership roles at Symbility Solutions Inc., Engagement Labs Inc. and Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation. = Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation = Paterson also serves on the Board of Directors at Lions Gate Entertainment, functioning as Chairman of the Audit Committee for the Board.

This is in comparison to the company's revenue for fiscal year 2011, which was reported at $7.95 million. = NeuLion Inc. (formerly JumpTV Inc.) = Paterson previously served as Vice Chairman of NeuLion Inc., a company that provides video content to Internet-connected devices for sports leagues such as the NHL, the NFL, the NBA and the UFC. In 2005, Paterson became Chairman of the company, which was known as JumpTV Inc. at the time.

On a February 2014\\"Walk the Talk with Michele Fiore\\" radio broadcast, February 21, 2015. Retrieved December 31, 2015. edition of her radio show, discussing Right-to-Try, Fiore described the cancer treatment by Cancer is a Fungus author Tullio Simoncini as an example of treatments that the terminally ill could access under Right-to-Try: \\"If you have cancer, which I believe is a fungus, and we can put a PICC line into your body and we're flushing, let's say, salt water, sodium carbonate, through that line, and flushing out the fungus. ... These are some procedures that are not FDA-approved in America that are very inexpensive, cost-effective.\\" The following year, on her February 21, 2015 broadcast, the theme was the concept of Right-to-Try; the bill had been introduced in the Assembly the previous week. At the top of the show Fiore raised the topic of her 2014 comments, \\"an issue that I have gotten a lot of questions about\\". She said, \\"I made comments about cancer that I didn't put in the proper context.\\" She had had a friend with cancer who had made \\"radical improvement using a doctor out of Italy's treatment covered in his book and his book was called Cancer Is A Fungus ... it was a tumor therapy of some sort. The point I was trying to illustrate was that people like my friend ... should have the right to decide their own fate and try experimental treatments like this.\\" She did not repeat that she believed that cancer was a fungus or that salt water could flush it out. After Fiore addressed the issue she and guest Jackie See, M.D., defended the Simoncini treatment and other alternative techniques as viable and as means by which the United States could lead the world medically if regulation and bureaucracy were reduced and doctors could \\"explor[e] all the treatments not knowing where the next breakthrough will come from.\\" After the 2015 radio program she received renewed national attention for her 2014 statements. Using sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) as a cancer treatment is espoused by Tullio Simoncini and is known as the Simoncini cancer treatment. Though this method has not been proven, and no evidence suggests that it or treatment with salt water would work, if either were to be accepted under the bill's requirements it could be legally considered a non-FDA-approved treatment that a terminally ill patient in Nevada could request. The bill that Fiore introduced eight days before her 2015 show requires that the drug, product or device \\"must have successfully completed Phase 1 of a clinical trial\\" and that it \\"is currently being tested in a clinical trial that has been approved by the [FDA].\\"Assembly Bill No. 164 as introduced. February 13, 2015. Nevada Legislature Retrieved December 31, 2015. Controversies =Gun use against law enforcement= In March 2016, Fiore was interviewed by the Las Vegas Sun. When asked about her support of militants involved in the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge earlier that year, she said, In April 2016, Fiore was interviewed for the KLAS 8 television show, Politics NOW. While discussing whether the 2014 armed resistance against federal agents was justified (the agents were in Bunkerville, Nevada to confiscate cattle owned by rancher Cliven Bundy because of defaulted grazing fees), she said, In May 2016, the Nevada Association of Public Safety Officers sent a letter denouncing Fiore's statements, concluding, In response, Fiore told KTNV 13 Action News that her original statement referred to federal Bureau of Land Management agents, not local police. She described BLM law enforcement agents as \\"wannabe cops\\" and the BLM as \\"a bureaucratic agency of terrorism that terrorized Americans, especially ranchers.\\" When pressed regarding the meaning of her previous statement, she said, =Involvement in the Bundy standoff= In April 2014, Fiore was interviewed by MSNBC's Chris Hayes and by Fox News's Sean Hannity regarding the armed confrontation at Bunkerville, Nevada between law enforcement officers and Cliven Bundy and his supporters. The interviews were shared thousands of times on social media. Fiore said, \\"The federal government should not show up with guns to collect on a debt\\" and called for the termination of \\"whoever ordered this to be done.\\" =Statement regarding wanting to shoot Syrian refugees herself= On November 21, 2015, on her weekly AM radio program on KDWN, Fiore explained why she had not signed a Nevada Assembly Republican caucus letter that called for a review of federal safeguards before Nevada would resettle Syrian refugees. She said, \\"We didn't know anything about the letter, nor did we get invited to be on the letter.\\" She went on, \\"He's like, 'The Syrian refugees.' I'm like, 'What, are you kidding me? I'm about to fly to Paris and shoot 'em in the head myself.' I mean, I am not OK with Syrian refugees. I'm not OK with terrorists. I'm OK with putting them down, blacking them out. Just put a piece of brass in their ocular cavity and end their miserable life. I'm good with that.\\" On December 7, 2015, she told the Associated Press, \\"I was not talking about the refugees.\\" She added, \\"I do not want Syrian refugees in our state, period,\\" and said that she did not trust the refugee vetting process to screen out terrorists. =2016 holiday photo= In December 2015, Fiore sent her constituents a 2016 calendar, which included a family Christmas portrait under the month of December, featuring her immediate family, all holding guns, and her grandchildren, one of whom was holding what appeared to be a handgun.Grinberg, Emanuella. \\"Nevada politician wishes you a Merry Christmas -- with guns.\\" CNN.com. 2015-12-06.

The photo went viral on Facebook, and drew criticism for depicting a small child holding a weapon. =IRS investigation= In December 2014, it was reported that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had filed dozens of tax liens totaling about $1 million against Fiore and her home healthcare businesses, Always There 4 You and Always There Personal Care. The liens against the businesses involved unpaid employee payroll taxes. In response, Fiore stated, \\"I am one-hundred percent in compliance with IRS - period.\\" Fiore blamed her ex-husband, who at one time acted as her accountant, and a former employee who stole from her while at the same time sent fraudulent documents to her current accountant to hide the embezzlement. The fallout from her issues with the IRS led to her being removed as majority leader and chairwoman of the Assembly Taxation Committee. Fiore was reinstated to her former position less than 24 hours after her removal. There were reports that Fiore reacted to the removal by saying there was a war on women in the Assembly Republican Caucus. \\"It was a total misquote,\\" Fiore said. \\"Nevada Republicans are not waging a war on women. We have a group in our caucus that are waging a war on conservatives.\\" =Voiding of home healthcare license= On November 3, 2015, the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services's Bureau of Health Care Quality and Compliance (HCQC) voided Fiore's license to operate Always There 4 You, a home healthcare service. Always There 4 You and another Fiore-owned home healthcare service, Always There Personal Care, received about $6 million (net) in Medicaid reimbursements between 2011 and March, 2015. Although in Nevada an unannounced inspection of such companies' business records is required to be completed every 18 months, in 2013 and 2015 health department inspectors were blocked several times from reviewing the records of Always There 4 You. They were denied access by office staff, by Fiore's mother, and both Fiore's mother and Fiore. In July 2015, after receiving a formal warning, Fiore met with health department officials in \\"a so-called conciliation process that essentially gives Fiore one more chance to comply\\". Fiore said that the meeting was \\"productive\\" and she was \\"prepared to welcome inspectors in the future with coffee and doughnuts.\\" In September 2015 an inspector found the Always There 4 You office dark and its door locked, with no notice posted on the premises explaining why. In October 2015 the Bureau sent a certified letter requesting clarification and again reminding Fiore that her license could be suspended or revoked. Fiore did not reply. On November 3, after officials arrived to find another business moving into the office location, the Bureau administratively closed the Always There 4 You license and notified Fiore. That night, Fiore issued a press release \\"regarding allegations that her home health care company was shut down by the government.\\" \\"With the signing of a Notice Of Dissolution last week, I have completely closed my home health care business. While the media will try to tell you that my business was shut down by the government, I would like to lay that rumor to rest.\\" The next day, the press release contents, under the title \\"You're Fired, State Inspectors!\\" and addressed to \\"Friends\\", were published on Fiore's website. \\"You're Fired, State Inspectors!\\" reproduces an article titled \\"When 'They' Win, We All Lose,\\" written for a local magazine the month before, which begins, \\"By the time you read this, my home health care business will be a memory ... It happened because 'They' won.\\" In \\"You're Fired\\" Fiore disclosed that she had been closing down her business for eight weeks. Always There 4 You was officially dissolved November 9, 2015. =Remarks at 2020 Clark County Republican Party convention= Fiore was accused of having, at the June 6, 2020 Clark County Republican Convention, made \\"racially charged remarks\\".

A flyer was circulated with the emblem of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department displayed across the width of the bottom of the flyer. The following day the City of Las Vegas issued a statement saying the event was not officially sanctioned.

Though municipal elections in Nevada are nonpartisan, Fiore framed the contest as a referendum on political ideology in an area where Republicans outnumber Democrats. Fiore faced a crowded field, including the retiring councilman's wife, Kelli. Fiore led with 46 percent of the vote in the first round.

They are identified with the Baptist tradition as they baptize only believers who have made a profession of faith and they only baptize by immersion. The word Primitive in the name refers to their adherence to the original principles of their Baptist ancestors, the Particular Baptists of England. Their articles of faith are based on the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith. The word Progressive refers to their inclusion of musical instruments, bible studies, youth camps, mission and charity organizations that are rejected by other factions of Primitive Baptists, often referred to as \\"old line\\" or \\"old school\\".  Controversy over use of musical instruments  In the early 1900s, Associations of the Primitive Baptists in the state of Georgia began to exclude churches from their membership that utilized the organ in worship services. The churches that utilized instrumental music in worship began to be known as Progressive Primitive Baptists. These churches formed their own Associations and became the Progressive Primitive Baptist denomination. The minutes of the 1907 Echeconnee Association (in Central Georgia) record an exclusion of churches and include this resolution outlining the Association's stance:Minutes of the 1907 Echeconnee Association meeting at Salem Church, Crawford County, Georgia, September 13-15th 1907 > Resolution Whereas, the Primitive Baptists have been greatly disturbed by > the introduction of new and unscriptural practices in their worship, viz; > Instrumental music, secret orders and other things of like character; > therefore, be it Resolved, That we declare against these measures in our > churches together with all others that practice or affiliate with the same.

The general purpose of the Foundation as set out in the Constitution and by-Laws is: ‚ÄúThe general nature or the object of the corporation is to assist, maintain or support aged ministers of the Primitive Baptist Church who are unable to serve churches, or are without sufficient funds to live on, and also to assist, maintain and support the widows of ministers of the Primitive Baptist Church when such is needed; to assist, maintain and support any of the pastors; and such other things, in conformity with this Charter, as may be needful and necessary for the Primitive Baptist cause.‚Äù The principle functions of the Foundation over the years, as provided for in the original by-laws, have been to give assistance to ministers, widows of ministers, and small churches; to publish the Bible Study material; publish the song book; to promote ministerial education and development; and make loans to churches. In 1986 a milestone was set with the establishment of a Ministers Retirement Program, under which the Foundation matches funds paid into the plan by the Ministers.

Radar Lake is located in Woodinville, Washington and is one of the first man-made lakes built specifically for water sports. The land it is built on was initially bought and developed by water sports innovator Herb O'Brien in 1972. O'Brien, drawing from his water sport experiences as a young man, envisioned Radar Lake to be an isolated and private area where enthusiasts could come and enjoy not only the thrill of the sport but also the pristine natural environment. In 1976, the property was bought by Seattle based owner of Seattle Electric, now Radar Inc.,Wilbur McPherson who gave it its current name in honor of his company. McPherson and O'Brien maintained a close relationship, and O'Brien bought Radar Lake back from McPherson in 2000. McPherson continued to live on the property, along with O'Brien and their respective families, until he lost his life to cancer in 2007.

Founded in 1855, it flourished under the stewardship of Benjamin Wood, becoming one of the highest circulation papers in the United States. It was notable for its racist and pro-Confederate views. The paper faltered after Wood's death in 1900, and folded in December 1906. History Benjamin Wood portrayed in August 31, 1861 issue of Harper's Weekly, refusing to fly the American flag at his paper and stomping on it, instead flying a Confederate flag with 4-11-44 on it, slang for the lottery; Wood owned a southern lottery. The paper was founded by Gideon J. Tucker in 1855, but he edited it until only 1857. Between 1857 and 1860, it was owned by W. Drake Parsons, 102 Nassau Street. Fernando Wood then bought the paper and put in his brother as editor; Benjamin soon after bought the majority interest. The paper reportedly soon became the country's highest- circulation daily paper. Under Wood the paper was pro-Southern/Confederate and defended slavery and the right to secede. It supported Stephen A. Douglas in the 1860 presidential election, decrying that if Lincoln won \\"we shall find negroes among us thicker than blackberries swarming everywhere,\\" in accord with its plainly racist viewpoint.Mr. Lincoln and New York - Benjawin Wood (1820-1900), Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, Retrieved 24 January 2017 After the Confederates fired at Fort Sumter, Wood refused a mob's demand that he fly the American flag at the paper's building. In August 1861, the U.S. government effectively shut down the paper (by suspending its delivery via the postal service) as being sympathetic with to an enemy of the United States (in this case, the Confederacy during the American Civil War). Wood was able to re-open the paper 18 months later, in May 1863.On This Day - August 31, 1861, The New York Times (2001), Retrieved 22 April 2017 In the 1870s, it is likely that only three newspapers in the United States had a circulation of over 100,000‚Äîall in New York: The Sun, New York Herald, and New York Daily News.Douglas, George H.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Kirkham, the archdeaconry of Lancaster, and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The church was designed by E. H. Shellard, and was built in 1848‚Äì49. The site for the church was given by the Clifton family of Lytham Hall, and the church was paid for by public subscription. The church was consecrated on 11 September 1850. It was originally a mission church to St Cuthbert, Lytham, and became a parish in its own right in 1870. Extensions to the transepts and the chancel, also by Shellard, were made in 1856‚Äì57. In 1897 a lych gate was erected in memory of Revd T. G. Smart, vicar of the church, who had died in the previous year. In about 1920 a southeast chapel was remodelled as a war memorial chapel by Frank Mee. Architecture =Exterior= St John's is built in sandstone ashlar with Cumberland slate roofs, and is in Early English style. Its plan consists of a narrow nave with a clerestory, wide north and south aisles, north and south transepts, and a chancel with a south chapel and a north vestry. Attached to the south aisle is a four-stage tower with corner pilasters. There is a doorway in the bottom stage, narrow lancet windows in the second and third stages, and louvred lancet bell openings in the top stage. Surmounting the tower is a broach spire with two tiers of lucarnes. Along the sides of the aisles are buttresses and paired lancet windows, and the clerestory has pilasters and small triple lancets. In the west wall of the nave are buttresses and two tall lancets. The transepts each have three very narrow lancets with a circular window above them. The east window consists of three stepped lancets. =Interior= Inside the church are six-bay arcades carried on short cylindrical piers. The pews are box pews with the doors removed. The war memorial chapel has a screen by Ernest Flower. The memorial in the chapel is in the form of a stone arcade, designed by Cartmell and carved by J. Stother. The stained glass in the south aisle dates from 1911, and consists of a scheme of Northern saints by Geoffrey Webb. The glass in the war memorial window is by B. D. Walmsley. The builder of the two-manual pipe organ is unknown. Work has since been carried out on it by Conacher of Huddersfield in 1874 and 1888, and in 1950 by Hele of Plymouth. There is a ring of six bells, all cast in 1875 by Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. External features The wall running along the south side of the churchyard and the lych gate are listed together at Grade II. The wall is in sandstone, is about high, and stands on a chamfered plinth. It is decorated with panels containing courses of pebbles. The lych gate stands opposite the south door of the church. It is timber-framed on stone piers, and has a roof of fishscale slates and terracotta ridge tiles with wooden finials. Appraisal The church was designated as a Grade II* listed building on 13 January 1971. Grade II* is the middle of the three grades granted by English Heritage, and is applied to buildings that are \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". The citation in the National Heritage List for England expresses the opinion that the church is among Shellard's best works. In the Buildings of England series, Hartwell and Pevsner state that \\"the interior shows Shellard at his best\\".

The Varela Zarranz family began their activities at the wine industry in 1933, a decade after the warehouse facility was built in 1888 by Diego Pons, who started the pioneer of the Uruguayan viticulture: Harriague, Vidiella, Varzi and Portal. History Winery in 1895 Old House in 1895 Olives en 1895 The history of the property dates back to the late nineteenth century. Until then, there were small-scale vineyards and the wine was made by European immigrants who occupied the area, using traditional methods and only for family consumption. In 1888 Diego Pons acquired plots of land and in the spring of that year he introduced its first vines, following the advice of his friend Francisco Vidiella, who recommended Pons on using lands for vineyards and associated crops. In 1892 he ordered the construction of the winery and wine cellar of the establishment. The cellar, with stone walls of two feet wide, maintained the conditions of constant temperature and humidity. Featuring a very modern facility for the time, it had two hydraulic presses, fermentation vats of concrete and 42 large oak barrels purchased in the workshops of Adolphe Fruhinsholz at Nancy (France). They were brought from France unarmed and each of its parts (called staves). It had been recorded the year they were built next to the signature of the manufacturer and a numbered brand that allowed to join them again. It's a unique collection in the country, which fascinates for its quantity and quality of conservation which coexists with modern French and American oak barrels where the best wines have their upbringing. The winery had attached a building for the production of olive oil. He also planted many olive trees, which most of them are still in perfect conditions with more than 100 years of age. They are represented on a flanking olive way access of about 200 meters. Other treasures were preserved until today like a diary written in ink by its founder, which was written in every day since he bought the land of how to plant the vines, how he began to build the house, the cellar, the first wines were made and stood out in his notes that the Cabernet was the king of his cellar. This journal contains several years of history and comes to the earliest XX. By the late nineteenth century, the Pons farm had about 400 has -in the town of Suarez, Canelones Department- of which 87 were intended to vineyards and the rest to olive groves. The 400,000 feet of vineyard belonged to a wide variety of strains, predominantly Harriague and Vidiella. The average production on Pons farm was about 870,000 kilos of grapes and 600,000 liters of wine annually. The Italian winemaker A. N. Galanti, who visited the company by 1915, referred to the quality of their wines which had earned several awards in national and international exhibitions: Bordeaux (silver medal, 1895), Brussels (honor diploma, 1910). They received several gold medals at exhibitions in Turin (1902), Athens (1903), Milan (1906), Minas (1904), Paris (1905) and Rome (Italy Ministry of Agriculture, 1906) among others. In 1944, when Pons was 80 years old, he decided to sell his winery to the Varela's family. Since he had no family interested in continuing with the wine industry, Pons wanted to sell his property to someone who valued and continued this activity to which he devoted most of his life to. Varela 's family was at the time engaged in the wine farm and was looking to expand. First Steps of Vi√±a Varela Zarranz Ramon and Antonio Varela, Spanish descendants, had settled in Las Piedras with a retail general store in the business. Since the 1920s, the firm had entered the wine trade, making a strong relationship with local producers. This activity gave the Varela's brothers a thorough understanding of the problems that lived in the sector. For the characteristics of the production, it was a strong dependence of farmers respects to the wineries in which, when vintage time arrived, they settled prices very low to the product. Moreover, the fragility of the grapes made vintners deprived the actual margins and effective negotiation. In 1933, Ramon and Antonio Varela founded in Las Piedras, signing Viticultores Unidos del Uruguay and settled in the town its first winery. In 1944, as noted, the firm acquired the Pons Farm. Twenty years later, in 1965, the firm Varela Zarranz -successors of Ram√≥n Varela ‚Äì focusing its activities on Suarez establishment.

File:Sala Toneles.jpgBarrel's Room File:Sala Toneles Antiguos.jpgOld Barrel's Room Vineyards Vineyards with Lyra's driving system Vineyard in Autumn The winery and vineyards are located about 10 km away from the River Plate. More than 100 hectares of land are home to vineyards of French origin. The Uruguayan emblematic Tannat grape, heads the list of the red wine grapes followed by Cabernet Sauvignon, whose presence in this establishment can be traced to the nineteenth century, Cabernet Franc and, Merlot. Among the white wine gapes we grow Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier and our exclusive production of Muscat Petit Grain. The vineyard surface encompasses two wine regions differentiated by their soil characteristic: Cuatro Piedras and Su√°rez. * Cuatro Piedras It develops over silt-clay sediments with calcium carbonate concretions. The surface is lightly hilly. Soils are of a black color with slit-clay textures, high fertility, moderately well drained and rich in calcareous. * Joaqu√≠n Su√°rez It spreads over the geology of silt-clay sediments in contact with crystalline rocks which emerge in some places. This generates shallow soils with light textures in average, some times with gravel due to variable lithologies of pre-Devonian rocks such as granites, migmatites and metamorphic schist rocks, well defined and of low fertility. The microclimate of both vineyards is influenced by the proximity of the sea (a few kilometers) and the cool breeze that is generated by promoting the development of flavours and aromas of fresh fruit and balanced acidity in white grapes, deep colour and ripe tannins and pleasant in reds. In Suarez the relative heigh of terrain reinforces the effect of wind, rapidly cooling the vines, citrus nuances giving white grapes and red fruits in reds. In Cuatro Piedras appears pear and apple notes on whites, and earthy and mineral in reds. The chosen conducting system is the Lyra, developed by the French researcher Prof. Alain Carbonneau. Special care exists that arises to prevent direct exposure to sunlight berries, avoiding sunny thereof and the loss of aroma compounds and subtle flavour. In this sense the inclination of both faces of the lyre decreases the angle of incidence of sunlight on the clusters. It is among the systems that allow a wide vegetation expression which is the main characteristic of the vines growing under our soil and weather conditions.

This process involves many proteins, one of which is the Histone-binding protein RbAp48 (also known as RBBP4 or NURF55), encoded by the RBBP4 gene in humans. Structure of protein RBBP4 Function Cartoon representation of the molecular structure of protein with 1p22, belongs to WD40 repeat RbAp48, also known as RBBP4 gene, encodes a nuclear protein, which belongs to a highly conserved family of WD40 repeat. This gene is present in many protein complexes that are involved in histone acetylation and deacetylation processes as well as chromatin assembly. This gene also belongs to the Mi-2/NuRD complex, also known as nucleosome remodeling deacetylase complex which plays a role in both ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylase activities. This protein is also part of a co-repressor complex which is an important component of transcriptional silencing. This gene is widely available and can be found in several cellular proteins which bind directly to the retinoblastoma protein to regulate growth and cell proliferation. This protein also found in the transcriptional repression of E2F-responsive genes, which are a group of genes that encode for a family of transcription factors. Biochemistry =Experimental process= To further distinguish age-related memory loss from Alzheimer's disease (AD), a subregion of the hippocampal formation called the dentate gyrus (DG) was further studied, since it is thought to be targeted by aging. Human postmortem tissue was collected from both DG and entorhinal cortex (EC). Entorhinal cortex is a neighboring subregion unaffected by aging and known to be implicated in age-related memory loss. After normalizing the expression of EC, 17 genes were manifested due to age-related changes in the DG. Mice were used as the experimental subjects to test whether the decline of RbAp48 was also related to age-related memory loss. The results were consistent with the human studies, where the level of RbAp48 protein was much lower in adults as compared to the young. To solidify these findings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed which revealed that dysfunction occurred in the DG, corresponding to the regionally selective decreases in histone acetylation. =Mechanism= The hippocampus is a brain region which has many interconnected subregions, with each region having its own distinct neuron populations playing an important role in encoding memory. Many studies showed that Alzheimer's disease (AD) ameliorates memory by first acting on the entorhinal cortex (EC) which is the region providing the main input conduit from the external sensors to the hippocampus. Scientists initially identified memory loss associated with aging as an early manifestation of Alzheimer's; however, more recent evidence suggests that a distinct process affects the dentate gyrus (DG), which is a subregion of the hippocampus, and causes memory deterioration. The hippocampal formation is made up of many interconnected subregions and plays a vital role in retaining memory. Each subregion contains a specific population of neurons which have distinct molecular expression and physiological properties. As a result, these regions are vulnerable to various pathogenic mechanisms. Although both AD and the normal aging process affect the hippocampus, studies showed that these two processes can be distinguished by two anatomical patterns of hippocampal dysfunctions. Postmortem studies suggest that the entorhinal cortex (EC) and the subiculum are the hippocampal subregions most affected by AD, whereas the dentate gyrus is relatively preserved in most cases. In contrast to AD, the normal aging process does not cause cell death or other pathognomonic abnormalities that result in memory loss. Rather, age-related memory loss is characterized by dysfunctioning neurons. These results from MRI and other studies suggest that the primary initial target of normal aging is the DG, whereas the EC is relatively preserved. Clinical study on humans Guided by the pattern that distinguishes age-related hippocampal dysfunction from AD, scientists from Columbia University Medical Center collected the dentate gyrus (DG) from postmortem human brains. These DG were free from any detectable brain pathology. These experimental subjects from which the DG was taken ranged from 33 to 88 years of age. Scientist also harvested the EC from each brain and generated gene expression profiles with Affymetrix microarray chips, where each microarray was customized to each individual's brain area. Their hypothesis was driven by the analysis that the DG is preferentially affected by aging rather than AD. The gene expression in the DG was normalized to their expression in EC; the normalized values of DG were then analyzed to find the correlation between age of the experimental subjects. Scientists found that 17 normalized profiles showed an increase and decrease with correlation to age. With a P ‚â§ 0.005, scientists confirmed that the observed changes were not the product of age-related change but rather the product of their relative abundance in the EC. One of the biggest change in terms of gene expression was the expression of gene RbAp48, where the p value conformed to the pattern of normal age-associated hippocampal dysfunction. To further advance their studies, scientists collected EC and DG from an additional 10 healthy human brains with ages ranging from 49 to 81 years. After the level of RbAp48 and actin in every single tissue was measured using Western blot, they discovered that the level of RbAp48 decreased with the increasing age. The level of mRNA also decreased as the age of the subject increased in DG; however, the level of RbAp48 remained unchanged in the EC. Clinical study on animals In mice, the RbAp48 protein is key component in histone acetylation, transcriptional regulation and in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase element-binding protein CREB1 path way. Since histone acetylation and the cAMP-PKA-CREB1 pathway are extremely important for normal hippocampal function and aging in mice, scientists further investigate RbAp48 to test whether its modulation was the cause of age-related memory losses in animals, especially mice. By studying wild-type mice, Scientists discovered that RbAp48 was expressed at a much higher level in the hippocampus, particularly in the dentate gyrus (DG). This finding was consistent with what they found in mice tissue because RbAp48 protein was less abundant in the DG of adult mice, as compared to a lower expression level in adult. In addition, the age-related reduction of RbAp48 was only detected in the DG, whereas the region of EC was preserved. This finding further solidifies the previous discovery that aging only affects the DG and does not cause the dysfunction of EC. =DNA interaction= The crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle where H3 and H4 are coloured in blue and green respectively.DNA is coloured gray In eukaryotic cells, DNA is wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins to form nucleosomes, which fold into higher-order chromatin structures. The nucleosome comprises two copies of histone H3 and histone H4. These nucleosomes form a heterotetramer and bind to DNA in the first step of nucleosome assembly. When DNA is replicated, nucleosomes need to be disassembled in front of the fork and the histones must then be transferred to the newly duplicated strands for reassembly. Studies of the in- vivo composition of histone H3 complexes, as well as the structural of the ASF1-H3-H4 complex, have shown that histone H3-H4 complexes are handled as a protein dimer. Proteins RbAp48 is a key player in the assembly of nucleosomes. RbAp48 protein is a subunit of the chromatin-assembly factor-1 (CAF-1) complex, which assembles histones H3 and H4 onto newly replicated DNA to initiate nucleosomes assembly. RbAp48 protein is also found in numerous other protein complexes for regulation of chromatin structure. Studies show that RbAp48 interacts with H3-H4 dimers and imply that the function of RbAp48 is involved in numerous process such as chromatin assembly, remodeling and modifications; therefore, in many other chromatin-related processes, histones H3-H4 might be handled as a dimer. More generally, it seems plausible that the presence of RbAp48 may reflex the post-translational modifications of the nucleosome. As a result, this can affect the activities of neurons and ultimately impact the memory encoding ability Cellular function *Histone acetylation and transcriptional regulation :It has been known for some time that histone acetylation is intimately connected with transcriptional regulation. * Chromatin function and acetylation :A direct link between chromatin function and acetylation was established by the discovery that co- activator complexes were required for transcriptional activation function as histone acetyltransferases, whereas co-repressors containing histone deacetylases confer transcriptional repression. Histones are locally modified on target promoters.  CREB complex CREB (top) is a transcription factor capable of binding to DNA (bottom) and regulating gene expression CREB-binding protein, also known as CREBBP or CBP, is a protein that is encoded by the CREBBP gene in humans. The CREB protein carries out its function by activating transcription, where interaction with transcription factors is managed by one or more CREB domains: the nuclear receptor interaction domain (RID), the CREB and MYB interaction domain (KIX), the cysteine/histidine regions (TAZ1/CH1 and TAZ2/CH3) and the interferon response binding domain (IBiD). The CREB protein domains, KIX, TAZ1 and TAZ2, each bind tightly to a sequence spanning both transactivation domains 9aaTADs of transcription factor p53.The prediction for 9aaTADs (for both acidic and hydrophilic transactivation domains) is available online from ExPASy http://us.expasy.org/tools/ and EMBnet Spain http://www.es.embnet.org/Services/EMBnetAT/htdoc/9aatad/ Protein interaction * SIN3 * BRCA1 * CREBBP References External links Memory disorders ","title":"Deficiency of RbAp48 protein and memory loss"},{"id":"41118091","text":"Zahir Belounis (born 15 February 1980) is a French-Algerian football player who plays as a striker.

In 1916, Major Davis and the First Infantry patrolled along the Mexico and U.S. border.Meites, Hyman L., ed. History of the Jews of Chicago. Chicago: Chicago Jewish Historical Society and Wellington Publishing, Inc., Reprint of 1924 ed., 1990, page 263. They engaged in multiple skirmishes with Pancho Villa's forces. = Lightning incident = On July 6, 1912, Major Davis and a group of soldiers were struck by lightning at Camp Lincoln outside of Springfield, Illinois. A Chicago Tribune article states Davis was the most seriously injured and was reported to be in critical condition with his tongue blackened and the soles of his feet burned. All men involved made a full recovery.  World War I  In World War I, Colonel Davis commanded the 132nd U.S. Infantry of Illinois. He became a highly decorated officer for his bravery in battle. The group under Davis' command consisted of a single battalion of 8-inch howitzers of the 44th Regiment Colonial Army Corps and the 2nd Battalion of the 123rd Field Artillery (155-millimeter howitzers). On May 16, 1918, the 132nd U.S. Infantry regiment had sailed on the \\"Mount Vernon\\" troop transport from Hoboken, New Jersey. They arrived at Brest, France between May 23 and May 30 under Davis' command. While in France, they served alongside the British 173rd and 174th brigades as well as the British 4th army. They trained with both British and Australian forces before receiving their \\"baptism of fire\\" in the Battle of Hamel. While in France, the 132nd Infantry under Davis' command had a mission to break through the enemy positions in front of and in the Bois de Forges and organize the Verdun‚ÄìSedan road 400 meters north of the Bois de Forges. The 131st was assembled in the northern part of the Bois de Forges and placed under Davis' command along with the 132nd Infantry. They had to cross the River Consenvoye the next day. In October 1918, Colonel Davis' unit and the 17th French Army Corps were attacked at St. Hilaire three days before the armistice. For repulsing the enemy attack, Davis was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Distinguished Service Medal.  After World War I  He participated in the founding of the American Legion with Milton J. Foreman in Paris. After the war ended, Davis became a Brigadier General in command of the 66th Infantry Brigade of the Illinois National Guard. On December 28, 1922, Davis married Marjorie n√©e Mayer.

Military Times Hall of Valor. Retrieved November 19, 2013 the Distinguished Service Medal, and the Cross of the French Legion of Honor. His Distinguished Service Cross citation states \\"Disregarding the heavy shell and machine-gun fire, Colonel Davis personally assumed command and by his fearless leadership and courage the enemy was driven back.\\" His Distinguished Service Medal also states \\"In the organization and training of his regiment he brought it to a notably high state of efficiency and morale with great thoroughness and in a remarkably short time. Afterward he handled it in all its actions against the enemy with marked success, displaying courage, resourcefulness, tactical skill, and military leadership of the highest order.\\" Death and legacy On January 7, 1937, Davis died of pneumonia at the age of 62.

Under this bill, the CFO compensation could equal the same compensation received by a senior executive service federal official. The bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. It passed the House on November 18, 2013. Background If this bill were to pass, it would establish the new level of compensation that the chief financial officer of the District of Columbia could receive. Congress has the power to establish the salary of such an official due to the unique status of Washington, D.C.. As the federal capital, the constitution grants the United States Congress exclusive jurisdiction over the district in \\"all cases whatsoever.\\" At certain times, and presently since 1973, Congress has allowed certain powers of government to be carried out by locally elected officials. This is referred to as \\"District of Columbia home rule.\\" However, Congress maintains the power to overturn local laws and exercises greater oversight of the city than exists for any U.S. state. Furthermore, the district's elected government exists at the pleasure of Congress and could theoretically be revoked at any time. Congress created the position of Washington D.C.'s Chief Financial Officer in the 1990s. In the summer of 2013, when Natwar M. Gandhi decided to retire from his position as DC CFO, the DC Council began to discuss increasing the CFO pay. The proposal of increasing the salary range up to $250,000 would have been a 20% pay increase over what the existing CFO was making. The existing salary was a maximum of $199,700 by law. In order for there to be any changes in the CFO salary, it would require an amendment to the city charter, authorized by Congress through formal legislation. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. H.R. 3343 would amend the District of Columbia Home Rule Act with respect to the compensation of the District of Columbia's chief financial officer (CFO). The bill would prohibit the CFO's total compensation (including allowances, differentials, bonuses, awards, or other similar cash payments) in a calendar year from exceeding the total annual compensation payable to the Vice President of the United States. Under existing law, the CFO is paid at an annual rate equal to the rate of basic pay payable for level I of the Executive Schedule. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on October 29, 2013. This is a public domain source. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that enacting H.R. 3343 would have no effect on the federal budget. The legislation would amend the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to increase the maximum pay for the chief financial officer (CFO) of the District of Columbia from $199,700 to the salary of the Vice President of the United States (currently $230,700). The salary of the district's CFO is paid for with local funds raised by the District of Columbia. Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 3343 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. On September 30, 2013, the CBO transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. 2793, the District of Columbia Financial Efficiency Act of 2013, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on July 24, 2013. H.R. 2793 contains a provision similar to H.R. 3343, and the estimated costs of those provisions are the same. Procedural history H.R. 3343 was introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D, DC-0) on October 28, 2013. It was referred to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which considered and markedup the bill on October 29, 2013. It was ordered reported by voice vote. The committee reported it alongside House Report 113-267 on November 15, 2013. On November 15,2 013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that the bill would be considered under a suspension of the rules on November 18, 2013. The bill passed the House with a voice vote on November 18, 2013. Debate Supporters of the salary increase argued that it was necessary to keep the CFO salary offered by the district comparable to the compensation offered by other similar cities. They also argued that managing DC requires unique skills because DC functions as both a \\"city and a state.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *District of Columbia home rule *District of Columbia Home Rule Act Notes/References External links *Library of Congress - Congress.gov H.R. 3343 *congress.gov H.R. 3343 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3343 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3343 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3343 *House Report 113-267 to accompany H.R. 3343 *House Republican Conference's legislative digest on H.R. 3343 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 3343 Acts of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"H.R. 3343 (113th Congress)"},{"id":"41118303","text":"Lygephila pallida is a moth of the family Erebidae first described by Andreas Bang-Haas in 1907.

Plot  Costante Nicosia (Lando Buzzanca), a businessman of Sicilian origins, is a boorish and irascible, man having married for wealth. He is the new boss of a recently inherited toothpaste factory and the owner of a local Rome basketball team. Nicosia is abusive to his employees and to his hunchbacked side-kick Peppino (Antonio Aliocca). Nicosia is also extremely superstitious. Peppino is less of a friend than a good luck charm as far as the insensitive Nicosia is concerned. He believes that it brings good luck to rub a hunchback's hump. In one day, a black cat crosses Nicosia's path, and he breaks a mirror in his apartment. Superstition demands that he persuade a virgin to urinate over the broken shards of glass in order to halt the tide of bad luck. Abusively, he passes a decrepit old spinster who lives next door to him mistakenly assuming that she has never done the \\"deed\\". Nicosia's relationship with his wife Mariu (Sylva Koscina) is scarcely more convivial for he is also antagonistic towards her. Reluctantly bowing to family pressure, Nicosia employs his loafing brother-in-law into a menial post at the factory. But he fires him the following day after catching the man asleep on the job, snoring loudly. That evening at a family gathering at his apartment, he is accosted by his ungrateful in-laws who try to shame him into giving the feckless man his job back. Instead of acquiescing to family practice, he bursts into an escalating tirade of rudeness against the singer's figure of his Great Aunt Maria (Grazia Spadaro). The old woman finally responds to his cynical remarks by uttering a curse. Nicosia dismisses her at first, that is until the old woman threatens of pour oil onto the floor; this heavy duty bit of magical business breaks Nicosia's nerve, and he recants in a babbling panic. Nicosia grovels for the curse to be lifted, and the old woman refuses to do so. A few days later, Nicosia is on a plane to Bucharest, Romania where he expects to attend a business conference. A tall, gaunt, suave man seated nearby introduces himself as Count Dragalescu (John Steiner), and after some small talk, he invites the troubled industrialist to visit him at his castle while in the region. Upon arriving at the hotel, Nicosia discovers that the conference has been postponed, leaving him stranded at the hotel for the entire weekend. Another businessman, named Meniconi (Franco Nebbia), tells him that there are no prostitutes to be had in the region, and that he has failed to seduce any of the local women, even after buying sexy lingerie to bribe them. He confides to Nicosia that he has taken to wearing the lingerie, brand named \\"Hot Night in Havana\\", himself. Rather the spend the weekend in this wretched hotel, Nicosia decides to call on the Count. Upon arriving in a taxi, Nicosia sees that the castle is very much what one would expect from a Romanian nobleman's abode, complete with lighting and thunder to amplify the Gothic effect. Count Dragalescu greets his guest in the cavernous dining hall. Suddenly, a group of revelers stagger down the large staircase into the dining hall. The Count introduces his companions (three women and a man) to the wary guest. The women greet Nicosia in a lavish, tactile manner. When Boris, the screaming camp male of the party, tries to greet Nicosia too, he backs up nervously away and declines. Laughing, the Count sends Nicosia up to his room to prepare for dinner. A little later, when Nicosia comes back down the stairs, well dressed in a tuxedo, he finds himself overdressed for the occasion. Very awkwardly, Nicosia sits down at his place at the dinner table near a very naked Count Dragalescu and his bevy of naked women. The evening gets even more debauched when Nicosia has a little too much to drink, strips off all his clothes too, cavorts with the three nude women of the assembled throng, and then passes out cold. The next morning, he wakes up in his bed with the mirthfully grinning Dragalescu laying next to him. Running in horror from the castle, the half-dressed Nicosia catches the first plane back to Italy. Back in Italy and working at his toothpaste company, Nicosia is rather tense and uptight. He greets all his employees who speak to him with a clenched and furious tone. While overseeing his basketball team at practice, he is knocked off balance when the coach tells the team, \\"you've got the big one!\\" Nicosia repeats the phrase \\"big one\\" over and over, and then collapses in the locker room when he sees a row of naked men's bottoms in the showers. Nicosia goes to his physician Dr. Paluzzi (Rossano Brazzi) who suggests that he try making out with his mistress, and if he cannot do that, the doctor adds that he must have been \\"deflowered while drunk\\". This attempt to re-establish his heterosexuality fails, however, because the tormented Nicosia feels compelled to bite her with and suck blood out of her neck. Even more stricken, first with anxiety and then with abject self-pity, Nicosia calls on his Great Aunt Maria to beg her to remove the curse which, he assumes, is responsible for his misfortune of homosexuality and blood craving. However, she claims that she had nothing to do with his urge for blood. She recommends that he visit the Magician of Noto (Ciccio Ingrassia) in Sicily for help and he complies in desperation. Upon arriving at the Magician of Noto's residence, Nicosia clearly sees from the posture and tone of voice, the magician is a fake. But Nicosia accepts his advice: the curse on him will be lifted only if he re-hires his brother-in-law. Nicosia leaves, where it is revealed to the viewers that the whole thing was a deliberate stunt organized by his in-laws into tricking Nicosia into giving his brother-in-law his job back. Returning home far from being cured, he responds to his needy wife's sexual advances by plunging his fang-like teeth into her bare bottom during foreplay. Over the next several months, Nicosia adopts a devil-may-care aggression; he re-fires his lazy brother-in-law, arranges to visit prostitutes to satisfy his urge to bite, and isolates himself from family and friends. Finally, he satisfies his craving for blood by setting up a blood-bank at his factory-site and compelling all employees to attend. Just as he seems to have surrendered to total cynicism, his wife arrives at the factory with a baby; his newborn son that was conceived that night of their passion. Rejoicing at his proof of his potency, Nicosia throws off the shackles of his paranoia and goes to greet and hold his baby son, only to discover in the final shot that the baby sports a protruding pair of fangs...

The film's screenplay included the comedy screenwriting team of Bruno Corbucci and Mario Amendola as well as Pupi Avati. Fulci has stated that Avati's contribution to the screenplay was only a few pages, specifically the trip to Romania, but not the trip to the night club. The dialogue in the film was revised to make it more spontaneous by Enzo Jannacci and Giuseppe Viola. The film was shot in eight weeks between March and April 1975. Release Dracula in the Provinces was distributed theatrically in Italy by Titanus on 31 August 1975. The film grossed a total of 940,484,803 Italian lire domestically on its initial theatrical release. Italian film historian and critic Roberto Curti noted that the film did \\"not do as well as expected\\" in the Italian box office. Fulci would declare it among his favorite films he directed. The film was released with the English-language titles Young Dracula and Dracula in the Provinces.

It follows the band on their first US tour down through California, and then to South by Southwest. It premiered on CBC Television on July 23, 2011. The film was directed by Brent Hodge and Thomas Buchan, and was produced by Brent Hodge, Jon Siddall and Sheila Peacock. It was nominated for a Leo Award in 2012.  Synopsis  The film follows the members of the band Said the Whale as they're about to embark on their first tour in the United States. It starts by introducing the members of Said the Whale, showing that even though they get a lot of radio play and have successful tours in Canada, they don't actually make enough money to live off of their music earnings so they all have separate jobs. They play a send off show in Vancouver, and then hit the road down to California on their way to South by Southwest. The tour hits a bit of snag when their trailer gets broken into and much of their gear gets stolen (2 acoustic guitars, an entire cymbal set, 3 suitcases, 7 guitar pedals, and a microkorg). Eventually they do make it to South by Southwest, and the rest of the documentary documents some of their shows there, some nights on the town, as well as Spencer (the drummer) getting attacked with a mustard bottle, and the band getting lemon tattoos to commemorate the trip. The documentary concludes with the band winning a Juno Award for new band of the year, highlighting the dichotomy between being successful in Canada, and being completely unknown in the U.S.  Cast  *Ben Worcester *Tyler Bancroft *Nathan Shaw *Spencer Schoening *Jaycelyn Brown Reception The film received positive reviews and was nominated for a Leo Award in 2012 for Best Short Documentary Program.

The term is offered as an alternative to the term old media. Residual media attempts to act as a corrective to the idea that when media become old, they absolutely become obsolete, or ‚Äúdead media.‚Äù Residual media ‚Äúreveals that, ultimately, new cultural phenomena rely on encounters with the old‚Äù.Acland, Charles R. Residual Media (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2007), Backcover. While old media can, and often does, become obsolete, they do not die. Instead, old media persist in our culture‚Äîeither in storage units or landfills, or as cultural capital for niche groups‚Äîor they can be moved to other parts of the world and other cultures. Regardless of where they end up, the media is not dead, they are still very much living, changing, and evolving. Residual media helps show that the transition between old and new media is not simplistic, well-defined, or sweeping. Examples of residual media include film cameras and film, record players and LP records, radio, letters, and postcards, etc. History Residual media was first defined in the edited collection Residual Media by Charles R. Acland. The term itself stems from Raymond Williams' study of culture‚Äôs dominant, emergent, and residual forms. The residual forms, Williams says, are ‚Äúexperiences, meanings and values which cannot be expressed in terms of the dominant culture,‚Äù but ‚Äúare nevertheless lived and practiced on the basis of residue‚Äîcultural as well as social‚Äîof some previous social formation‚Äù.Williams, Raymond. \\"Base and Superstructure in Marxist Cultural Theory.\\" Problems in Materialism and Culture (New York: Verso, 1973/1980), 41 In relation to media, the dominant culture would be new media, while the residual would be the forms of media that have come before, but are still in use regardless of the new supplanting them. Williams‚Äôs definition of the residual is also important because it emphasizes that these old forms of media are ‚Äústill active in the cultural process, not only and often not at all as an element of the past, but as an effective element of the present‚Äù. Residual media, though antiquated or seen as lesser than the new media, still exist in the present and still affect that which is dominant. The way we interact with the old still informs the way we interact with the new, and the new informs the way we interact with the old. The idea of residual media is closely related to Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin's theory of Remediation (Marxist theory). Examples *The Vinyl revival - Since 2006, sales of vinyl records, a form of residual media, have been rising while the sales of CDs, new media, have been dropping. In 2012, vinyl sales in the United States went up 17.7%, while CD sales dropped 13.5%; in the United Kingdom vinyl sales jumped 15.3%, while CD sales dropped 20%.Digital Trends - The Turntable Strikes Back Digital downloads are still the most utilized method of purchasing music, but vinyl records remain culturally relevant. *Skeuomorphism - is a derivative object that retains ornamental design cues from structures that were necessary in the original. The digital skeuomorphs found in places like Evernote, which showed physical notebooks, or Apple iOS6's Notes app, which looked liked a lined reporter's notebook, show how \\"old media\\" still exert a pressure on the new.

In 1882, two 4-4-0 American type tank locomotives entered passenger service on the private Kowie Railway which was under construction between Port Alfred and Grahamstown. The Kowie Railway The private Kowie Railway between Port Alfred and Grahamstown was built and operated by three successive private enterprises, all of which ran into financial difficulties.The South African Railways - Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, pp. 12-13. In 1881, the Government of the Cape of Good Hope passed a Bill to authorise the London-based Grahamstown and Port Alfred Railway Company to construct a railway from Port Alfred to Grahamstown. The contract for construction was awarded to Pauling & Co. and the first sod was officially turned on 21 October 1881.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1943). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter II - The Cape Government Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, November 1943. pp. 811-812, 818. The Port Alfred-Grahamstown- Alicedale line The surveyed route of the line crossed the Kowie River at Blaauwkrantz, where a high bridge needed to be constructed. It had been estimated that the line would be completed by the end of 1883, but since the construction of the Blaauwkrantz Bridge delayed progress, the line was only partially opened to traffic from Port Alfred as far as Blaauwkrantz on 24 December 1883. Here, passengers had to disembark and complete the journey to Grahamstown on the post cart. On 1 October 1884, the bridge was completed and opened to traffic. The Kowie Railway linked up with the Cape Government Railways at Grahamstown on 11 November 1884. Manufacturer In 1882, two 4-4-0 American type tank locomotives, with works numbers 294 and 295, were delivered from Hunslet Engine Company to the Grahamstown and Port Alfred Railway Company. The locomotives were acquired for passenger working and were named Grahamstown and Bathurst respectively. They were designed for wood- burning and were equipped with large American-style balloon smokestacks which incorporated spark arresters. Liquidation Partly as a result of the difficulties experienced with harbour development at Port Alfred, the Grahamstown and Port Alfred Railway Company soon experienced financial difficulties and was forced into liquidation in 1887. In 1888, a group of Grahamstown residents formed a syndicate and took over the operation of the line to Port Alfred until 1895, when they sold out to the Kowie Railway Company. The Kowie Railway was never prosperous. After the Cape Government eventually abandoned its attempts at harbour development at Port Alfred in 1898 due to the continuous silting up of the Kowie River, the line's financial difficulties increased. Track maintenance was neglected and the situation was aggravated by a series of minor accidents. The Blaauwkrantz disaster Kowie Railway 4-4-0T, crossing Blaauwkrantz Bridge with a mixed train, c. 1910 The Kowie Railway's death blow came on 22 April 1911. A mixed train from Port Alfred, made up of six goods trucks, three passenger carriages and a guard's van, came to grief when one of the goods trucks derailed on the Blaauwkrantz Bridge and, with the three carriages and the guard's van, plunged into the ravine below. Of the 55 passengers, 31 were killed and 23 seriously injured. The resultant claims against the Kowie Railway Company forced it into bankruptcy.Heritage Portal: The Port Alfred to Grahamstown Railway The Port Alfred Kowie Railway 1883-1913 South African Railways On 1 April 1913, the line was taken over by the Union Government and became part of the South African Railways. The two passenger locomotives, along with the two goods engines Port Alfred and Kowie, and three Cape 4th Class 4-6-0TT locomotives which had been purchased from the Cape Government Railways around 1904, remained in service on this line until they were scrapped.

He was the great-great-great- grandfather of the philosopher John Locke (1632‚Äì1704). Family William Lok was the second son of Thomas Lok, a London mercer, and the grandson of John Lok, also a mercer, who was Sheriff of London in 1461. His mother was Joan Wilcock (d.1512), only daughter of one 'Mr Wilcock' of Rotherham, Yorkshire.Joan Wilcock (d.1512), A Who‚Äôs Who of Tudor Women: Wi-Z compiled by Kathy Lynn Emerson to update and correct Wives and Daughters: The Women of Sixteenth-Century England (1984) Retrieved 27 November 2013. Career Anne Boleyn, for whom Lok brought French translations of the Gospels from overseas Even before he was admitted to the Mercers' Company in 1507, Lok had already supplied cloth of gold and silver to Henry VIII. During the course of his visits as a mercer to the annual markets in Antwerp and Bergen op Zoom in the Low Countries, he collected intelligence which he passed on to the King and his chief minister, Thomas Cromwell. In March 1527 he was granted 'exclusive licence to import silks, jewels, and mercery wares for court revels'. In addition to his trade as a mercer, Lok was involved in other business ventures, including the export of beer. In 1528 he supplied the royal ordnance with six hundred leather harnesses. In 1531 a ship travelling from Chios to London which had been hired by Lok and John Gresham was detained at Lisbon. According to a letter dating from 1533, Lok had at some time visited Crete, and may thus have been involved in the wine or currant trade. The wealth he had accumulated as a merchant by 1535 is indicated by the fact that he was rated in that year, perhaps in connection with a subsidy, at ¬£1000. Lok and his wife were Protestants, and supported Henry VIII's divorce from Catherine of Aragon. His daughter, Rose Lok, later recounted how he pulled down a copy of the bull by which Pope Clement VII had excommunicated Henry VIII for his marriage to his second wife, Anne Boleyn: > Of my father in Holinshed's Chronicle I find this story. In the 25th year of > the reign of King Henry 8, being the year of Our Lord 1534,McDermott dates > the incident to December 1533. at the suit of the Lady Catherine, Dowager, a > curse was sent from the Pope, which cursed both the King and the realm. This > curse was set up in the town of Dunkirk in Flanders, for the bringer thereof > durst no nearer approach, where it was taken down by Mr Lok of London, > mercer. Now I, his daughter, Rose Throckmorton, widow, late wife of Simon > Throckmorton, esquire, and first the wife of Anthony Hickman, a merchant of > London, reading this of my father, have thought good to leave to my children > this addition to it, that for that act the King gave him ¬£100 a year, and > made him a Gentleman of his Privy Chamber, and he was the King's mercer, and > his Majesty vouchsafed to dine at his house. Moreover he was knighted, > although he was never mayor, but only Sheriff of London, and so was never > any Londoner before him. Lok also brought French translations of the Gospels and Epistles from the continent for Henry VIII's second wife, Anne Boleyn. On 20 October 1545 he was elected alderman for Vintry ward, and on 3 March 1549 was elected Sheriff, and knighted by the young Edward VI. On 10 October 1549 he was among those who escorted the Lord Protector, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, to imprisonment in the Tower of London after his first fall from power. Lok died 24 August 1550 at his house in Bow Lane, and was buried on 27 August near his parents and his first wife, Alice Spenser, in the Mercers' Church at St Thomas of Acre in London, where his coat of arms was depicted in a window. His fourth wife, Elizabeth Meredith, was also buried there after her death in 1551. In his will he left houses and shops in various London parishes including Bow, Spitalfields, and Cheapside, as well as twelve farms near London, and the Dog's Head inn in Cheapside. Marriages and issue Lok married firstly Alice Spenser (d.1522), an early convert to Protestantism. He married secondly Katherine Cooke (d. 14 Oct 1537), daughter of Sir Thomas Cooke of Wiltshire.According to Lee she was the daughter of William Cooke of Salisbury, and at her death on 14 October 1537 was buried at Merton Priory in Surrey.

Dynamic functional connectivity is a recent expansion on traditional functional connectivity analysis which typically assumes that functional networks are static in time. DFC is related to a variety of different neurological disorders, and has been suggested to be a more accurate representation of functional brain networks. The primary tool for analyzing DFC is fMRI, but DFC has also been observed with several other mediums. DFC is a recent development within the field of functional neuroimaging whose discovery was motivated by the observation of temporal variability in the rising field of steady state connectivity research.  Overview and history  = Static connectivity = Functional connectivity refers to the functionally integrated relationship between spatially separated brain regions. Unlike structural connectivity which looks for physical connections in the brain, functional connectivity is related to similar patterns of activation in different brain regions regardless of the apparent physical connectedness of the regions. This type of connectivity was discovered in the mid-1990s and has been seen primarily using fMRI and Positron emission tomography. Functional connectivity is usually measured during resting state fMRI and is typically analyzed in terms of correlation, coherence, and spatial grouping based on temporal similarities. These methods have been used to show that functional connectivity is related to behavior in a variety of different tasks, and that it has a neural basis. These methods assume the functional connections in the brain remain constant in a short time over a task or period of data collection. The default mode network above is one example of a brain network seen using steady state connectivity. This network is fairly stable in time, but it has been shown to have a variable relationship with other networks, and to vary slightly in its own characteristics in time. = The origin of dynamic analysis = Studies that showed brain state dependent changes in functional connectivity were the first indicators that temporal variation in functional connectivity may be significant. Several studies in the mid-2000s examined the changes in FC that were related to a variety of different causes such as mental tasks, sleep, and learning. These changes often occur within the same individual and are clearly relevant to behavior. DFC has now been investigated in a variety of different contexts with many analysis tools. It has been shown to be related to both behavior and neural activity. Some researchers believe that it may be heavily related to high level thought or consciousness. = Significant findings from DFC = Because DFC is such a new field, much of the research related to it is conducted to validate the relevance of these dynamic changes rather than explore their implications; however, many critical findings have been made that help the scientific community better understand the brain. Analysis of dynamic functional connectivity has shown that far from being completely static, the functional networks of the brain fluctuate on the scale of seconds to minutes. These changes are generally seen as movements from one short term state to another, rather than continuous shifts. Many studies have shown reproducible patterns of network activity that move throughout the brain. These patterns have been seen in both animals and humans, and are present at only certain points during a scanner session. In addition to showing transient brain states, DFC analysis has shown a distinct hierarchical organization of the networks of the brain. Connectivity between bilaterally symmetric regions is the most stable form of connectivity in the brain, followed by other regions with direct anatomical connections. Steady state functional connectivity networks exist and have physiological relevance, but have less temporal stability than the anatomical networks. Finally, some functional networks are fleeting enough to only be seen with DFC analysis. These networks also possess physiological relevance but are much less temporally stable than the other networks in the brain.  Methods of analysis  = Sliding window = Sliding window analysis is the most common method used in the analysis of functional connectivity, first introduced by Sakoglu and Calhoun in 2009, and applied to schizophrenia. Sliding window analysis is performed by conducting analysis on a set number of scans in an fMRI session. The number of scans is the length of the sliding window. The defined window is then moved a certain number of scans forward in time and additional analysis is performed. The movement of the window is usually referenced in terms of the degree of overlap between adjacent windows. One of the principle benefits of sliding window analysis is that almost any steady state analysis can also be performed using sliding window if the window length is sufficiently large. Sliding window analysis also has a benefit of being easy to understand and in some ways easier to interpret. As the most common method of analysis, sliding window analysis has been used in many different ways to investigate a variety of different characteristics and implications of DFC. In order to be accurately interpreted, data from sliding window analysis generally must be compared between two different groups. Researchers have used this type of analysis to show different DFC characteristics in diseased and healthy patients, high and low performers on cognitive tasks, and between large scale brain states. = Activation patterns = One of the first methods ever used to analyze DFC was pattern analysis of fMRI images to show that there are patterns of activation in spatially separated brain regions that tend to have synchronous activity. It has become clear that there is a spatial and temporal periodicity in the brain that probably reflects some of the constant processes of the brain. Repeating patterns of network information have been suggested to account for 25‚Äì50% of the variance in fMRI BOLD data. These patterns of activity have primarily been seen in rats as a propagating wave of synchronized activity along the cortex. These waves have also been shown to be related to underlying neural activity, and has been shown to be present in humans as well as rats. = Point process analysis = Departing from the traditional approaches, recently an efficient method was introduced to analyze rapidly changing functional activations patterns which transforms the fMRI BOLD data into a point process. This is achieved by selecting for each voxel the points of inflection of the BOLD signal (i.e., the peaks). These few points contain a great portion of the information pertaining functional connectivity, because it has been demonstrated, that despite the tremendous reduction on the data size (> 95%), it compares very well with inferences of functional connectivity obtained with standard methods which uses the full signal. The large information content of these few points is consistent with the results of Petridou et al. who demonstrated he contribution of these \\"spontaneous events\\" to the correlation strength and power spectra of the slow spontaneous fluctuations by deconvolving the task hemodynamic response function from the rest data. Subsequently, similar principles were successfully applied under the name of co-activation patterns (CAP). = Other methods = Time-frequency analysis has been proposed as an analysis method that is capable of overcoming many of the challenges associated with sliding windows. Unlike sliding window analysis, time frequency analysis allows the researcher to investigate both frequency and amplitude information simultaneously. The wavelet transform has been used to conduct DFC analysis that has validated the existence of DFC by showing its significant changes in time. This same method has recently been used to investigate some of the dynamic characteristics of accepted networks. For example, time frequency analysis has shown that the anticorrelation between the default mode network and the task-positive network is not constant in time but rather is a temporary state. Independent component analysis has become one of the most common methods of network generation in steady state functional connectivity. ICA divides fMRI signal into several spatial components that have similar temporal patterns. More recently, ICA has been used to divide fMRI data into different temporal components. This has been termed temporal ICA and it has been used to plot network behavior that accounts for 25% of variability in the correlation of anatomical nodes in fMRI.  Controversy and limitations  Several researchers have argued that DFC may be a simple reflection of analysis, scanner, or physiological noise. Noise in fMRI can arise from a variety of different factors including heart beat, changes in the blood brain barrier, characteristics of the acquiring scanner, or unintended effects of analysis. Some researchers have proposed that the variability in functional connectivity in fMRI studies is consistent with the variability that one would expect from simply analyzing random data. This complaint that DFC may reflect only noise has been recently lessened by the observation of electrical basis to fMRI DFC data and behavioral relevance of DFC characteristics. In addition to complaints that DFC may be a product of scanner noise, observed DFC could be criticized based on the indirect nature of fMRI which is used to observe it. fMRI data is collected by quickly acquiring a sequence of MRI images in time using echo planar imaging. The contrast in these images is heavily influenced by the ratio of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Since active neurons require more energy than resting neurons, changes in this contrast is traditionally interpreted an indirect measure of neural activity. Because of its indirect nature, fMRI data in DFC studies could be criticized as potentially being a reflection of non neural information. This concern has been alleviated recently by the observed correlation between fMRI DFC and simultaneously acquired electrophysiology data.  Physiological evidence  fMRI is the primary means of investigating DFC. This presents unique challenges because fMRI has fairly low temporal resolution, typically 0.5 Hz, and is only an indirect measure of neural activity. The indirect nature of fMRI analysis suggests that validation is needed to show that findings from fMRI are actually relevant and reflective of neural activity. = Multi modal approach =  Electrophysiology  Correlation between DFC and electrophysiology has led some scientists to suggest that DFC could reflect hemodynamic results of dynamic network behavior that has been seen in single cell analysis of neuron populations. Although hemodynamic response is too slow to reflect a one-to-one correspondence with neural network dynamics, it is plausible that DFC is a reflection of the power of some frequencies of electrophysiology data. Full EEG caps like the one above are often used simultaneously with fMRI in order to capture information about the electrical signals underlying the BOLD signal. Electroencephalography (EEG) has also been used in humans to both validate and interpret observations made in DFC. EEG has poor spatial resolution because it is only able to acquire data on the surface of the scalp, but it is reflective of broad electrical activity from many neurons. EEG has been used simultaneously with fMRI to account for some of the inter scan variance in FC. EEG has also been used to show that changes in FC are related to broad brain states observed in EEG.  MEG  Magnetoencephalography (MEG) can be used to measure the magnetic fields produced by electrical activity in the brain. MEG has high temporal resolution and has generally higher spatial resolution than EEG. Resting state studies with MEG are still limited by spatial resolution, but the modality has been used to show that resting state networks move through periods of low and high levels of correlation. This observation is consistent with the results seen in other DFC studies such as DFC activation pattern analysis. = Behavioral basis = DFC has been shown to be significantly related to human performance, including vigilance and aspects of attention. It has been proposed and supported that the network behavior immediately prior to a task onset is a strong predictor of performance on that task. Traditionally, fMRI studies have focused on the magnitude of activation in brain regions as a predictor of performance, but recent research has shown that correlation between networks as measured with sliding window analysis is an even stronger predictor of performance. Individual differences in functional connectivity variability (FCV) across sliding windows within fMRI scans have been shown to correlate with the tendency to attend to pain. The degree to which a subject is mind wandering away from a sensory stimulus has also been related to FCV.  Clinical relevance  One of the principal motivations of DFC analysis is to better understand, detect and treat neurological diseases. Static functional connectivity has been shown to be significantly related to a variety of diseases such as depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. Because of the newness of the field, DFC has only recently been used to investigate disease states, but since 2012 each of these three diseases has been shown to be correlated to dynamic temporal characteristics in functional connectivity. Most of these differences are related to the amount of time that is spent in different transient states. Patients with Schizophrenia have less frequent state changes than healthy patients, and this result has led to the suggestion that the disease is related to patients being stuck in certain brain states where the brain is unable to respond quickly to different queues. Studies with Alzheimers disease have shown that patients suffering from this ailment have altered network connectivity as well as altered time spent in the networks that are present. The observed correlation between DFC and disease does not imply that the changes in DFC are the cause of any of these diseases, but information from DFC analysis may be used to better understand the effects of the disease and to more quickly and accurately diagnose them.

Biography Dwernicki was born in a noble family of Sas coat of arms, which owned villages in Podolia. His parents were Polish patriots, and at the age of 12, young J√≥zef entered a military school, where he remained until 1795. He then returned to the family property at Zawale in Podolia, where he took care of the farm. In 1806, when during the War of the Fourth Coalition, French armies approached the Vistula river, Dwernicki, together with his friend Augustyn Trzecieski, decided to find the so-called Patriotic Society, which planned an anti-Russian uprising. The insurrection failed, due to the Treaties of Tilsit, signed in July 1807. In 1809, Dwernicki armed 80 men, crossed the Zbruch river, and joined Polish troops under Piotr Strzy≈ºewski (May 27, 1809, near Tarnopol). He fought in the Polish‚ÄìAustrian War: his bravery and efforts resulted in promotion to the rank of captain. In 1810, Duke J√≥zef Poniatowski awarded him the Virtuti Militari, and nominated him commander of a squadron in the 15th Uhlan Regiment, formed in Podolia. Dwernicki, together with his uhlans, fought in the French invasion of Russia of 1812. In January 1813, he was promoted to the rank of major, and in March, he once again was awarded the Virtuti Militari. Soon afterwards, he received French Legion of Honour. In the summer of 1813, after the disastrous invasion of Russia, Dwernicki became commandant of the 8th Uhlan Regiment, with which he fought in France and Germany. After the Battle of Wartenberg (October 3, 1813), Napoleon Bonaparte personally awarded him Golden Cross of the Legion of Honour. Dwernicki also distinguished himself in the Battle of Leipzig. On January 4, 1814, he was promoted to the rank of Colonel, and became commandant of the Krakus Regiment, with which he fought in the suburbs of Paris. =After the Napoleonic Wars= Following the Napoleonic Wars, Dwernicki returned to Congress Poland, joining the Freemasons in 1816. He was named commandant of the 2nd Uhlan Regiment, which was stationed in Podlasie. His military skills were greatly appreciated by Russian Governor of Poland, Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich, who awarded him several orders. In 1826, Dwernicki was transferred to Warsaw, and in 1829, was named Brigadier general. Soon afterwards, he wrote a book on rules and regulations of Russian cavalry. In the autumn of 1830, when the November Uprising began, Dwernicki was stationed in Sieradz, where he commanded 3rd Regiment of Mounted Rifles. He was immediately ordered to return to Warsaw, where he was tasked with creating new units of the Polish Army. By January 1831, Dwernicki created 18 squadrons, ready to enter combat. General Dwernicki Crossing the Austrian Border, by Georg Benedikt Wunder (1786-1858) In late January 1831, the Polish National Government decided to send an army corps to Podolia, Volhynia and Ukraine. Dwernicki was named commandant of this unit, but in February 1831, when Russian Army entered Congress Poland, Commander in Chief Michal Gedeon Radziwill ordered him to stop the advance of General Teodor Geismar. On February 14, 1831, the Russians were defeated in the Battle of Stoczek, and Dwernicki was afterwards promoted to Divisional general. Following the battle, Dwernicki and his unit marched to G√≥ra Kalwaria, and then engaged the Russians in several places, such as Warka, Kozienice, Pu≈Çawy, Lublin and Zamo≈õƒá. In early April 1831, Dwernicki crossed the Bug river, and marched into Volhynia, hoping to start the uprising in this province of former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. His corps consisted of some 7,000 soldiers, but their situation quickly deteriorated. There were few volunteers, and local population did not respond to Dwernicki‚Äôs announcement to the residents of Volhynia, Podolia and Ukraine. On April 11, 1831, Dwernicki clashed with Russians near Poryck; four days later he fought the Russians again near Beresteczko. Disappointed by lack of support of local residents, he then marched to Podolia, but once again, he failed to rouse the population. Facing encirclement, on April 27, 1831 Dwernicki and his unit crossed Russian - Austrian border near Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç√≥w. =Temporary exile= The General was for some time interned by Austrian authorities, and in November 1831, he left for Paris, joining the Great Emigration. He immediately became involved in patriotic activities. Dwernicki was a founder and member of several organizations, and was a very popular activist, whose house was visited by such people, as Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte and Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. In 1834, he married his second wife, Maria Ludwika Alina de Brok (his first wife, Julianna, died after falling ill during the Volhynian raid of Dwernicki‚Äôs corps). Soon afterwards, they moved to London. In 1848, Austrian government allowed Dwernicki to visit Galicia. His arrival at Lw√≥w turned into a mass patriotic demonstration, and Dwernicki decided to stay in this city. He became a friend of Count Adam Zamoyski, who supported him financially, and invited Dwernicki to visit his real estate in Lopatyn near Brody. The General died on November 23, 1857 in Lopatyn, and was buried there.

The majority of esports titles are fighting games, first-person shooters (FPS), real-time strategy (RTS), or multiplayer online battle arena games (MOBA), with the MOBA genre being the most popular in terms of participation and viewership. The following is a selection of games which currently have or had a professional scene, sorted by genre and ordered roughly chronologically. Fighting games Fighting games were among the earliest games to be in tournaments, with the founding of what would become the Evolution Championship Series in 1999. Competitions in the genre are generally individual competitions with both players providing input to the same machine. The genre originally focused on arcade play, but has gradually moved to console play as arcades have declined. The Street Fighter series, Mortal Kombat series, Marvel vs. Capcom series, Tekken series, Killer Instinct series and Super Smash Bros. series are amongst those fighting games played at a professional level. Important tournaments for the genre include the Evolution Championship Series and Capcom Cup, Tougeki ‚Äì Super Battle Opera was a major tournament for several years. Fighting game enthusiasts generally prefer the moniker \\"competitive gaming\\", and often eschew the term \\"e-sports\\", citing cultural differences between the predominantly PC-gaming esports communities and the older arcade-gaming community. Members of the fighting game community are generally especially cognizant of their cc to the old arcade-era competitions, wishing to prioritize the preservation the spirit of those competitions over simple monetization of fighting competitions. =Street Fighter= The Street Fighter has one of the earliest and longest running professional gaming scenes. Professional Street Fighter players include Daigo Umehara, who had two of his matches included in a 2011 Kotaku list of \\"The 10 Best Moments in Pro-Gaming History\\". His early 1998 match against American player Alex Valle in Street Fighter Alpha 3 ranked sixth and his 2004 comeback against American player Justin Wong in Street Fighter III: Third Strike ranked first, while his 2009 grand finals match against Wong in Street Fighter IV at Evo 2009 was listed as having \\"[j]ust missed the cut.\\" =Super Smash Bros.= Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. series has a large competitive community. While every title has been featured in high-profile tournaments, Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate are the most popular for high level competition as of 2018. Major League Gaming regularly sponsored Melee events from 2004 to 2007, before dropping it in favor for the 2008 sequel Super Smash Bros. Brawl. According to Major League Gaming, over 400 Super Smash Bros. Brawl competitive tournaments were held in 2010 in North America. Since then, Melee has again been periodically hosted at MLG events, with the latest being MLG 2015 World Finals. Smash Wii U had an online contest sponsored by ESL. Other notable national tournaments to feature Smash games include Apex and Evolution Championship Series (EVO). At EVO 2019, Smash Ultimate became the largest Smash tournament ever with 3,534 entrants. =Marvel vs. Capcom= Marvel vs. Capcom (MvC) is a fighting game series developed by Capcom that features characters from Capcom games and Marvel comic book characters. The series was played at the Evolution Championship Series from 2000 until 2017. =Tekken= Namco's Tekken series is known as the lightning chess of fighting games, having a large player base in Asian countries. Over the years Tekken has been cited as the most technical among fighting games. Praised for its balance, strong basics, depth and one of the few fighting games to feature a real 3D design, it continues to be featured in various championships. The \\"Master cup\\" series of Japan, \\"Final round\\" series of U.S.A, \\"Strongstyle\\" series of U.S.A, \\"UT\\" championship series of Europe are a few examples of events that are, or started off as exclusive Tekken events, and still hold it as a main game. The \\"King of Iron Fist Tournament\\" is a Tekken only tournament hosted by Namco themselves. Apart from this, other shows such as \\"Tekken Crash\\", \\"Tekken Strike\\" are Tekken only shows held in South Korea on the E-sports channel \\"Nice Game T.V\\". Tekken has made it periodically into the Evo Championship series, and since 2013 has become a permanent part of the event. Although it has a lesser player-base in the west, it seems to be steadily rising. In the east it dominates the arcade scene today leaving other games of its genre miles behind. =Killer Instinct= The Killer Instinct series is a combo-heavy franchise created by Rare and currently maintained by Iron Galaxy Studios and Microsoft. The franchise' most-played game is the 2013 Killer Instinct reboot, with the platform of choice being Xbox One. A circuit for the game has been created called the Killer Instinct World Cup, with a second iteration ending in early 2017. Killer Instinct's best player is Jonathan \\"Rico Suave\\" Deleon, who currently holds the EVO and Killer Instinct World Cup titles. In January 2017, Ultra Arcade enforced a ban on taunting and teabagging in major Killer Instinct tournaments which sparked controversy among the fighting game community with some stating that it is considered impossible to enforce due to certain players' playstyles. First-person shooters First person shooters focus on simulating a firefight from a first person perspective, and may be either individual or team based. Classic games include the PC game Team Fortress 2, which is featured in a few smaller leagues such as the ESEA League, RGL, United Gaming Clans, and European Team Fortress 2 League. Call of Duty and Halo competitions usually play their console editions. = Doom = Doom is a series of multiplayer 1v1 and free-for-all deathmatch games developed by id Software. Doom is notable for establishing the arena-style deathmatch format, and also was partially responsible for the first online FPS community through DWANGO, an online gaming service officially endorsed and partially worked on by id Software. People also played Doom deathmatch online through other BBS services. The Ultimate DOOM and Doom II, alongside Heretic, were played in the Deathmatch '95 tournament, sponsored by id Software, Microsoft, and DWANGO. This tournament, perhaps the first PC esports tournament of its kind, was played through the online DWANGO service. Finalists from the US and the UK were flown to Microsoft headquarters to compete in a LAN party format event, named Judgement Day. Dennis Fong, best known for his victory at the Red Annihilation tournament for Quake, won Judgement Day, marking his first entry into esports. Doom II was also played in Cyberathlete Professional League and QuakeCon tournaments.

Carmack's own red Ferrari 328 GTS convertible. Quake 4 supported a small professional scene, with a dozen professional players signed to a few professional teams and a number of players marketing themselves through other means. Tournament play for Quake 4 peaked around 2006, with the game included in tournaments such as the Electronic Sports World Cup, the World Series of Video Games before the league's demise, the World Cyber Games 2006, and KODE5. As of 2008, Quake 4 has fallen out of favor in competition for the previous game in the series, Quake III Arena. Quake Live was released in 2010, primarily based on Quake III Arena. Quake Live was played in tournaments such as DreamHack, QuakeCon, and FaceIt. The popularity of the title declined after a couple years. In 2012, the last major tournament to host Quake competitions, the Intel Extreme Masters, decided to drop the title. =Counter-Strike series= A Counter- Strike match in Electronic Sports World Cup 2007, Paris The Counter-Strike series is a series of team based first person shooters which began as a Half- Life mod which was bought by Valve and released from beta in 2000. Professional competition is centered in North America and Europe in tournaments such as the World Cyber Games, CEVO, ESEA League, Intel Extreme Masters, Cyberathlete Professional League and the Electronic Sports League. The defunct league Championship Gaming Series franchised teams with contracted players who played Counter-Strike: Source. Counter Strike is consistently at competitions such as DreamHack and World Cyber Games as the 1.6 version released in 2003, despite newer versions having been released by Valve over the years. The most recent game in the series, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released in August 2012. Although Counter-Strike did not appear in the World Cyber Games 2013, the largest prizepool in the series' history has been announced for RFRSH as part of the BLAST Premier Series, with US$1.5 million. =Call of Duty series= The Call of Duty series is a first-person shooter that has been played as an esport primarily in North America and is primarily played on PlayStation consoles, but was formerly played on Xbox. It has been featured in MLG tournaments ever since Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was introduced to the league in 2008. Tournaments usually have a large number of unknown teams competing to play with the top pro teams. A well known example is OpTic Gaming, who have earned hundreds of thousands of dollars from competing in leagues and tournaments. =Unreal Tournament= Beginning with the release of the first game in 1998, the Unreal Tournament series of first person shooters supported competitions in the early 2000s, such as the series' inclusion the World Cyber Games from 2001 through 2004. There are no longer major tournaments for the series, as it has been dropped from leagues such as the Electronic Sports League. =Halo series= The Halo series has been featured in the American Major League Gaming since the release of Halo: Combat Evolved for the original Xbox. The series has also been played internationally, such as the European Console League's event in July 2010 in Liverpool. The Australian Cyber League hosted a Pro Circuit with tournaments in several major cities in Australia, including a January 2009 event in Brisbane. Partially due to changes to the series' design, Halo competitions have gone into steep decline that started in 2010 with the release of Halo: Reach, a drastic change from what was considered traditional Halo, as seen in the original three games. The decline had continued into late 2013/2014 where Halo 4 had been introduced and was an even bigger change to the series than Halo: Reach, and as a result had no major competitive events held, other than the Halo 4 World Championships, which was put on by developer 343 Industries as an early attempt to save Halo esports. 343 Industries later released Halo: The Master Chief Collection, re-releasing all 4 original titles in 60fps, but featuring a completely remastered version of Halo 2 to use as the primary game for halo esports. Although this was a good attempt by the developer to bring back the dying community, the game suffered from many bugs and glitches that made the game unplayable, which furthermore damaged that Halo esports community. At the same time around the release of Halo: the Master Chief Collection, 343 Industries introduced the Halo Championship Series as another attempt to re-establish Halo as a competitive esports title. As Halo declined, it was dropped from Major League Gaming, to be replaced by Call of Duty as the new staple game for the league. Currently Halo 5 is the newest game in the series and has entirely built around being competitive and well suited for esports, featuring vanilla competitive settings, a wide array of competitive game modes, and an in-depth spectator mode. 343 Industries is hosting the Halo World Championships, which will be a 4v4 competition, held in part with competitive leagues MLG, ESL, and Gfinity. The prize pool is currently 2 million dollars, which is crowd funded through Halo 5's in-game \\"REQ Pack\\" purchases. The game franchise's history in esports is currently focused at the Halo Championship Series (HCS) Pro League in conjunction with the ESL esports organization, with the first season finished up in =Painkiller= Painkiller is a 2004 game developed by Polish game studio People Can Fly and published by DreamCatcher Interactive. At the end of 2004 Painkiller was chosen by the Cyberathlete Professional League to be their official 2005 CPL World Tour game. This was slightly controversial with many e-sports followers and competitors due to the fact that other games had proven themselves at least as popular online multiplayer games. As the tour had already been announced as a one-on-one deathmatch format competition, Unreal Tournament 2004 and Doom 3 were also fan favourites for this tour. However, since Unreal Tournament 2004 developer Epic Games was in the process of changing publishers from Atari to Midway Games and could not guarantee their full support throughout the year- long tour, it was not chosen. An agreement between the CPL and DreamCatcher stipulated that no other organization was allowed to use Painkiller in a gaming competition with prizes above 2,000. without obtaining a license from the CPL. For the 2006 CPL World Tour, Quake III Arena was selected as the one- versus-one deathmatch game, replacing Painkiller. =Battlefield series= Battlefield series games have been played in multiple tournaments.

As of 2013, the WCS system divides players into three leagues: WCS Korea, WCS Europe, and WCS North America. Players earn points based on their performance in many different tournaments, including the ones mentioned above, and the 16 players with the most points advance to world championship at BlizzCon. In the 2013 grand finals, sOs beat the crowd favorite Jaedong 4‚Äì1, winning the $100,000 grand prize. The 2nd-place finish for Jaedong awarded him $45,000, making his total prizepool earnings $489,384.83, the highest of any esports player at that time. =Warcraft III= Warcraft III has been played professionally all around the world, especially in South Korea, China, France, and Germany. Although the game never achieved the same competitive popularity of the original StarCraft, the game supported a few dozen professional teams. The game lacks a singular world championship, as there have been numerous large tournaments. Events have been organized by Blizzard Entertainment, have also been televised Korean leagues, and large tournaments have been held in China. Chinese players generally have used their own clients for online competition, due to a poor connection to the outside world. Notable Warcraft III players include: Xiaofeng \\"Sky\\" Li, Dae Hui \\"FoV\\" Cho, Jang \\"Moon\\" Jae Ho, Fredrik \\"MaDFroG\\" Johansson and Manuel \\"Grubby\\" Schenkhuizen. In more recent times, Warcraft III competition has declined in popularity. Many professional Warcraft III players have since moved to Starcraft II, including Grubby and Moon. Despite this, Warcraft III continues to be played competitively, still appearing in events such as WCG 2013.

History  There is no definite information about when the church was built. The church is not mentioned in the sources of the fighting in Oslo in 1240 between King Haakon IV and Duke Skule, suggesting that it is possibly younger. In 1989 a stick with runic inscriptions, dated to the first half of the 13th century, was found. The name Holy Cross Church occurs in these inscriptions, and it indicates that it may be older than 1240. When the church was built, it was located far north in the city, and an urban development north of the church came in the second half of the 13th century and the 14th century. Holy Cross Church had input from the west, from the cemetery, an entrance from the west and an entrance directly to the chancel from the south.

The production began in 1969 as a part of Suomen Autoteollisuus (SAT) and the first vehicles were based on lorry components. The portfolio grew by time. The production facilities were in H√§meenlinna until the mid 1990s, when they were moved to Tampere. The company produced terminal tractors also in Texas under the name Magnum in 1987‚Äì2005. STS became a limited liability company in 1994 and was sold and restructured in 1997. Subsequently, the Sisu brand was replaced by Kalmar.  Initial development  The first four prototypes were produced in 1969. The vehicles were type T-9SV and they were largely based on Kontio-Sisu lorry components. The customer was stevedoring company Oy √Ökerman Ab. In 1970 SAT started a development project jointly with consulting company Jaakko P√∂yry for suitable vehicles for loading and unloading of ro-ro vessels. As a result, SAT launched a four-wheel-drive model TV-10 and its reversed steering version T-10 in 1971. 22 units were produced in the same year. A significant feature was its patented fifth wheel coupling system which enabled a quick a flexible engagement. The solution was developed by technician Nils Fagerstedt and it paved the success in export market. After the promising start, the model selection was extended gradually; rear-wheel drive TV-12 came in 1974 and 4√ó4-model T-13 in 1977.  Creation of the business unit  DI Christer Schalin was appointed the Production Manager of the terminal tractor production line in 1979. He had previously worked as the Export Manager of SAT and started now to work hard to develop the terminal tractor business. Schalin expanded the export market and he also created the Sisu Terminal Systems name and logo.  Breakthrough  Sisu terminal tractor at Katajanokka quay in Helsinki. In autumn 1980, Sisu TR-200, which was the world's strongest terminal tractor by then, was presented in Portex fair in Hamburg. The Sisu terminal tractors could be designed relatively easily according to the customer requirements due to highly modulised structure; this led to success in export markets in particular. As the capacity of the H√§meenlinna factory could not meet the need time to time, some units were assembled in the Karis factory.  Magnum and Ottawa  Sisu-Auto founded a new terminal tractor factory in White Oak, Texas in 1987. The main responsibility of the project was on Heikki Luostarinen who later became the company General Manager.Blomberg (Suomalaista...): Heikki Luostarinen: Sisun tekninen osaaminen varmisti yrityksen jatkuvuuden. p. 229‚Äì234. The vehicles were branded first Sisu, later Sisu-Magnum and at the end just Magnum. The factory was closed down in 2005 and production of Magnum terminal tractors was continued in other facilities. In 1993 Sisu-Auto acquired Ottawa Truck Corporation which was its main competitor in North American market. Some trucks were sold with combined Sisu and Ottawa badging.  Organisational changes  The terminal tractors were separated from the other vehicle production under its own organisation in 1989. In 1991 Sisu Terminal Systems division was founded for the RoRo equipment manufacturing. When Sisu Corporation was created as a consequence of merger between the owning Sisu- Auto and Valmet wheeled machines, STS became a limited liability company (Oy). As a part of the following restructuring the production was transferred gradually to former Valmet facilities in Tampere. The last terminal tractor produced in H√§meenlinna rolled out from the factory in January 1996. The terminal tractor production totalled about 2 600 units by the production transfer. The vehicles produced in the Karis factory are included into the figures. In addition, hundreds of gooseneck trailers and other container carriages were produced. A new acquisition followed in 1997 when Partek took over Sisu Corporation. At the same time Partek bought the Swedish container handling equipment producer Kalmar Industries, into which STS was joined. Use of Sisu brand on terminal tractors was discontinued thereafter, and the name kept on living as a lorry producer.

History  Zulily was founded in 2009 by former Blue Nile executives Mark Vadon and Darrell Cavens after Vadon's wife had become pregnant and he was overwhelmed by the supplies they were not aware of needing. Zulily went live on January 27, 2010 with an initial focus on children's apparel. By the fourth quarter of 2010, Zulily was a cash-flow-positive business. When Zulily went public in November 2013, the company had 2.6 million active customers and $331 million in revenue. Its initial public offering valued the company at $2.6 billion. In August 2015, Zulily was purchased by Liberty Interactive's QVC division for $2.4 billion. In September 2017, Zulily launched Private Label Credit Card. Business model Zulily's target audience is mothers who have an interest in unique brands and products for their children; their audience has also been described as \\"young, tech-savvy mothers\\". Sales change daily, starting from 6 a.m. Pacific time, and they hold no inventory. In 2014, half of Zulily's orders came from mobile devices. Sales generally last 72 hours. In 2015, it decreased the number of flash sales, in response to some customers who were overwhelmed by the amount of merchandise from which to select. Retaining customers is a challenge for it: \\"the flash-sale website is straining to hold on to customers and realizing it may have inundated shoppers with too many deals\\". Although revenue was up 29% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the prior year, that was less of a huge increase than the 52% shown for the last quarter of 2014 compared to one year earlier, leading the company to lower its estimate of anticipated revenues in 2015. Although the web site for the company says they hold no inventory, in 2015 they began to hold some merchandise in warehouses to shorten the time for delivery. The lack of inventory has caused quality control issues including defective merchandise, damaged merchandise, incorrect or incomplete products being sent to customers. The company will issue refunds for shipping paid on the damaged, defective or incorrect merchandise if it was the only item bought, or it will replace the item for free (emailing photos of the issue is helpful). The company is including some established brands in addition to the emerging brands on which it had completely relied.

Mutations resulting in a lack of expression of the SLC1A1 gene, a member of the solute carrier family, are found to cause development of dicarboxylic aminoaciduria in humans. SLC1A1 encodes for EAAT3 which is found in the neurons, intestine, kidney, lung, and heart. EAAT3 is part of a family of high affinity glutamate transporters which transport both glutamate and aspartate across the plasma membrane.  Symptoms  Dicarboxylic aminoaciduria involves excretion of urinary glutamate and aspartate, resulting from the incomplete reabsorption of anionic amino acids from the glomerular filtrate in the kidney. This affects a diseased individual's amino acid pool, as they will have to spend additional resources to replenish the amino acids which would have otherwise been present. Additionally, glutamate transporters are responsible for the synaptic release of the glutamate (neurotransmitter) within the interneuronal synaptic cleft. This hindrance of functionality in individuals with dicarboxylic aminoaciduria may be related to growth retardation, intellectual disability, and a tendency toward fasting hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis. Dicarboxylic aminoaciduria is diagnosed by finding the increased presence of glutamate and aspartate in the urine. Cause  Basic transport of glutamate in the synapse as well as the neuroglia. Glutamate transporters are proficient at pumping glutamate into cells due to their ability to couple with inorganic ions. Transport of glutamate into the cell requires the coupling of three sodium ions as well as a proton, whereas transport out of the cell requires a single potassium ion. This transport results in two positive charges being displaced across the membrane per cycle. Moreover, this process is dependent on a pH gradient, due to glutamate needing to be protenated prior to transport. = Mutations = Dicarboxylic aminoaciduria is the result of a point mutation of tryptophan to arginine at position 445 and a deletion mutation of isoleucine at position 395. EAAT3 is found in location 9p24, it is primarily expressed in the brain and kidneys. =Metabolism= In the gastrointestinal tract, protein digestion and absorption are key to establishing and maintaining amino acid pools. In the case of dicarboxylic aminoaciduria, where glutamate and aspartate transport are impaired, the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism are affected. Enterocytes in the intestines break up peptides into residual amino acids where they would normally use charge-specific amino acid transporters to get across the epithelial cells. In dicarboxylic aminoaciduria, the anionic amino acid transporter, EAAT3, cannot bring glutamate and aspartate across epithelial cells, leading to them being excreted via the urine. Examples Below is an example of how glutamate is used to synthesize alanine via alanine transaminase. :Glutamate + pyruvate ‚áå Œ±-ketoglutarate + Alanine Alanine transaminase Another example is the conversion of aspartate to glutamate via the enzyme aspartate transaminase. :Aspartate + Œ±-ketoglutarate ‚áå Oxaloacetate + Glutamate Aspartate transaminase.

The valley had many creeks and streams that came out of the surrounding canyons that were lined primarily with poplars. Pioneer accounts indicate that people had to be on top of their horses and rise up in the saddle to see over the tall grass of what now is downtown Salt Lake City. Accounts seem to indicate that there only was one tree in the Valley, a juniper in an area near a monument on present day Sixth East and Third South.Gardens Of Temple Square - Episode 30 of Legacy, created in cooperation with the Family History and Church History Departments. Available in MormonChannel.org - accessed 19 Nov 2013. Church tradition has it that the garden concept originated from the suggestion of a general authority who, while traveling to the Eastern United States to visit the world's fair in 1893, wanted to bring to Salt Lake City the trees he saw in the exposition. Some of the grand elm trees planted on Temple Square from that year's world's fair still exist along the central walkway through Temple Square.Ryan Morgenegg (Nov. 5, 2011). The secret of the gardens at Church headquarters Church News. Much of the initial proposals and organization of the gardens, as well as many LDS chapels and temples in Utah, began right after the Great Depression under the supervision of Irvin T. Nelson, a valedictorian from Weber State University. Nelson took over the supervision of the Temple Square gardens after the death of his predecessor in 1944. The Olin Partnership landscape architectural firm from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania designed the LDS Conference Center landscape.  Planting  New arrangement of flowers and bedding plants are brought in each planting season. Some of the techniques used in the past range from formal French parterres to old- fashioned English cottage gardens. Using a technique called \\"tossing\\", gardeners throw the different varieties of flower packs onto the beds in a natural flow to coordinate growth. Flowers don't usually appear in single, neat rows of the same flower type. = Genius loci = Designers for Temple Square gardens base their flowering patterns on the genius loci, a Roman term for spirit of place. The technique is explored based on the land art balancing the contribution of natural and ephemeral sculptures to spirit of place. For example, during times of construction or excavation in downtown Salt Lake City, the patterns in the garden change based on the overall tunes of the surrounding environment, ruling out superfluous features. The character of the gardens around the Salt Lake Temple differ from the gardens surrounding the pragmatic aluminum roofs of the Tabernacle or the Gothic Revival architecture of the Salt Lake Assembly Hall. = Skeleton, tendon and flesh = In order to yield an effective combination of sizes, colors and texture effects, flowers are planted in an organized process called \\"skeleton, tendon, and flesh\\". The skeleton consist of a series of core group of flowers or small trees. The tendons link to them are usually drought-resistant shrubs. At Temple Square, flowers make up the flesh to fill the remaining space. Together, the group of plants in the \\"skeleton\\" and \\"tendon\\" groups make up about 20 percent of the design. About 80 percent of the territory is made up by the \\"flesh\\" group of flower, which need simple weed control and little to no water. At certain interchanges, stone becomes \\"flesh\\". = Piston effect = The gardens are frequently arranged by a technique called the \\"piston effect.\\" Named after the action of the pistons in a car that alternate up and down, the flowers and plants are placed so as to highlight different growth cycles throughout the year. As one group of flowers bloom (pistons up) another group in the same area will be falling away (pistons down). This tends to generate interest at different blooming periods of the region.  Christmas lights  In the early 1960s, E. Earl Hawkes, former Deseret News publisher and general manager of the Hearst Corporation's Record American-Sunday Advertiser in Boston, supported by advertising executive David W. Evans, proposed lighting Temple Square with Christmas lights patterned after the lighting of the Boston Common. Evans and his staff already had been designing dioramas and other materials for the Mormon pavilion at the New York World's Fair and for church visitors' centers associated with temples and historical landmarks. The LDS Church began displaying Christmas lights around Temple Square in 1965 under the direction of church president David O. McKay.Douglas D. Palmer. Landscaper originally fought lights on Square Deseret News Nov. 26 1993. Accessed 19 Nov 2013. Irvin Nelson, along with his prot√©g√© and successor, Peter Lassig, met on several occasions to persuade McKay against the lighting plans. Initially, church electricians were in charge of the lighting project. Church employed gardeners are now in charge of the project every winter. Evans and his advertising firm designed a Nativity scene, which was built in 1967 between the Tabernacle and the North Visitors' Center. A similar Nativity set is still part of the decorations through the Christmas seasons. The lighting now includes the Temple Square grounds as well as the visitors' centers and the inside of the Tabernacle for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and other holiday concerts.

Three days later, on November 18, the same gunman attacked the offices of the Lib√©ration newspaper and the headquarters of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale bank. The gunman hijacked a motorist whom he forced to drive to Champs-√âlys√©es before releasing him. The attacks set off a manhunt in search of the gunman, who was later apprehended. The gunman, Abdelhakim Dekhar, was already known to police for his role in the 1994 Rey-Maupin affair. Attacks =BFMTV Studio Incident= On November 15, 2013, Dekar, acting alone, entered BFM-TV's news network station wielding a pump-action shotgun. He threatened journalists in the lobby briefly before leaving the station. It is unclear whether his weapon malfunctioned or if he chose not to shoot, but he left multiple unused cartridges and told witnesses, \\"Next time, I won't miss.\\" = Lib√©ration News Headquarters Attack and Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale Incident = On November 18, 2013 at 10 a.m., just three days after the initial attack, Dekar entered the headquarters of the Lib√©ration newspaper and opened fire. During the attack, a 23-year-old freelance photographer was shot in the arm and chest. The gunman soon left and the victim was rushed to the hospital with critical injuries near his heart. Just two hours after the shooting at the Lib√©ration newspaper, two shots were fired outside the French bank, Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale. Soon after, witnesses described the shooter as wearing a khaki coat and hat. No one was injured. =Escape= After fleeing from the site of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale shooting, Dekhar acquired a vehicle by taking a man hostage in the town of Pluteaux, near La D√©fense. Dekar forced the man to drive three and a half miles towards central Paris before letting him go at the Champs-√âlys√©es. The gunman continued to flee but was later arrested in an underground parking complex 6 miles north of Paris, in Bois-Colombes. Officials reported that the gunman was extremely incoherent due to multiple prescription medications that he had consumed within a short period of time. It was later reported by officials that he tried to attempt suicide this way. Suspect Parisian prosecutor Fran√ßois Molins alleged that a lone gunman was behind the three attacks and the hijacking. On November 20, French authorities arrested Abdelhakim Dekhar in Bois-Colombes on suspicion of carrying out the attacks. Authorities said DNA and video evidence indicated that Dekhar was responsible for each of the attacks. Dekhar was already known to police due to his role in the Rey-Maupin affair in which the police alleged that he had supplied a gun to Rey and Maupin, a couple who would eventually attack five police officers in a high profile chase. Police acquired a number of \\"confused\\" letters written by Dekhar, in which he accused the media of \\"manipulation of the masses\\", of capitalism, and of participating in a \\"fascist plot.\\"Paris gun suspect Dekhar 'wrote confused letters BBC. 21 November 2013 =Family and early life= Abdelhakim Dekhar was born in 1965 in Algrange, France. The third of eleven children, it is widely believed that he was born into an extremely unstable family and was a troubled child. At an early age, he ran away from home and spent a short period of his childhood in sponsored care. At 17, he joined the military and served in the 9th Parachute Regiment. During his first trial in the 1990s, he explained to the judge that his service was cut short because he was recruited to work for the Algerian secret service. After his release from prison in the late 1990s for his involvement in the Rey-Maupin affair, Dekhar lived quietly in Britain. =Involvement in Rey-Maupin affair= In 1998, Dekhar was sentenced to four years in prison for supplying the gun used by anarchist youths in an attempted robbery in the 1994 Rey-Maupin affair, but was soon released, having already served most of his time before the verdict. Motivation At the trial, Dekhar claimed he was suicidal and \\"desperate\\" for the police to kill him, and raised political topics such as France's colonization of Algeria and social problems in the French suburbs. Trial and sentencing In 2017, Dekhar was sentenced to serve 25 years for the 2013 attacks.

Stiffness is the degree to a which an object resists deformation when subjected to a known force. This idea is also referred to as impedance, however, sometimes the idea of deformation under a given load is discussed under the term \\"compliance\\" which is the opposite of stiffness (defined as the amount an object deforms under a certain known load). In order to effectively interact with their environment, humans must adjust the stiffness of their limbs. This is accomplished via the co-contraction of antagonistic muscle groups. Humans use neural control along with the mechanical constraints of the body to adjust this stiffness as the body performs various tasks. It has been shown that humans change the stiffness of their limbs as they perform tasks such as hopping, performing accurate reaching tasks, or running on different surfaces. While the exact method by which this neural-modulation of limb stiffness occurs is unknown, many different hypotheses have been proposed. A thorough understanding of how and why the brain controls limb stiffness could lead to improvements in many robotic technologies that attempt to mimic human movement.  Stiffness  Stiffness is typically viewed as a material property describing the amount a material deforms under a given force as described by Hooke's law. This means that objects with higher stiffness are more difficult to bend or deform than objects with lower stiffnesses. This concept can be extended to the limbs and joints of biological organisms in which stiffness describes the degree to which a limb or joint deflects (or bends) under a given load. Limb stiffness can also be described as the static component of impedance. Humans change the stiffness of their limbs and joints to adapt to their environment. Limb and joint stiffness has been previously studied and can be quantified in various ways. The basic principle for calculating stiffness is dividing the deformation of a limb by the force applied to the limb, however, there are multiple methods of quantifying limb and joint stiffness with various pros and cons. When quantifying limb stiffness, one cannot simply sum the individual joint stiffnesses due to the nonlinearities of the multi-joint system. A few of the specific methods for calculating limb stiffness can be seen below: Vertical Stiffness (k vert) is a quantitative measure of leg stiffness that can be defined by the equations below: K_\\\\text{vert}=\\\\frac{F_\\\\text{max}}{\\\\Delta y} Where F max is the maximum vertical force and delta y is the maximum vertical displacement of the center of mass K_\\\\text{vert}=m(\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{P})^2 Where m is the body mass and P is the period of vertical vibration K_\\\\text{vert}=m\\\\omega_\\\\text{0}^2 Where m is the mass of the body mass and œâ 0 is the natural frequency of oscillation Limb Stiffness (K_limb) is the stiffness of the entire limb and can be defined by the equations below: K_\\\\text{limb}=\\\\frac{F_\\\\text{max}}{\\\\Delta L} Where F max is the maximum applied force and ŒîL is the change in length of the limb Torsional Stiffness (K_joint)is the rotational stiffness of the joint and can be defined by the equations below: K_\\\\text{joint}=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta M}{\\\\Delta \\\\theta} Where ŒîM is the change in joint moment and ŒîŒ∏ is the change in joint angle K_\\\\text{joint}=\\\\frac{2W}{\\\\Delta \\\\theta} Where W is the negative mechanical work at the joint and ŒîŒ∏ is the change in joint angle These different mathematical definitions of limb stiffness help to describe limb stiffness and show the methods by which such a limb characteristic can be quantified.  Stiffness modulation  The human body is able to modulate its limb stiffnesses through various mechanisms with the goal of more effectively interacting with its environment. The body varies the stiffness of its limbs by three primary mechanisms: muscle cocontraction, posture selection, and through stretch reflexes. Muscle cocontraction (similar to muscle tone) is able to vary the stiffness of a joint by the action of antagonistic muscles acting on the joint. The stronger the forces of the antagonistic muscles on the joint are, the stiffer the joint becomes. The selection of body posture also affects the stiffness of the limb. By adjusting the orientation of the limb, the inherent stiffness of the limb can be manipulated. Additionally, the stretch reflexes within a limb can affect the stiffness of the limb, however these commands are not sent from the brain. = Locomotion and hopping = As humans walk or run across different surfaces, they adjust the stiffness of their limbs to maintain similar locomotor mechanics independent of the surface. As the stiffness of a surface changes, humans adapt by changing their limb stiffness. This stiffness modulation allows for running and walking with similar mechanics regardless of the surface, therefore allowing humans to better interact and adapt with their environment. The modulation of stiffness therefore, has applications in the areas of motor control and other areas pertaining to the neural control of movement. Studies also show that the variation of limb stiffness is important when hopping, and that different people may control this stiffness variation in different ways. One study showed that adults had more feedforward neural control, muscle reflexes, and higher relative leg stiffness than their juvenile counterparts when performing a hopping task. This indicates that the control of stiffness may vary from person to person. = Movement accuracy = The nervous system also controls limb stiffness to modulate the degree of accuracy that is required for a given task. For example, the accuracy required to grab a cup off of a table i very different from that of a surgeon performing a precise task with a scalpel. To accomplish these tasks with varying degrees of required accuracy, the nervous system adjusts limb stiffness. To accomplish very accurate tasks higher stiffness is required, however, when performing tasks where accuracy is not as imperative, lower limb stiffness is needed. In the case of accurate movements, the central nervous system is able to precisely control limb stiffness to limit movement variability. The cerebellum also plays a large role in controlling for the accuracy of movements. This is an important concept for everyday tasks such as tool use. For example, when using a screwdriver, if limb stiffness is too low, the user will not have enough control over the screwdriver to drive a screw. Because of this, the central nervous system increases limb stiffness to allow the user to accurately maneuver the tool and perform a task.  Neural control  The exact mechanism for the neural control of stiffness is unknown, but progress has been made in the field with multiple proposed models of how stiffness modulation may be accomplished by the nervous system. Limb stiffness has multiple components that must be controlled to produce the appropriate limb stiffness. = Combination of mechanics and neural control = Both the neural control and the mechanics of the limb contribute to its overall stiffness. The cocontraction of antagonistic muscles, posture of the limb, and stretch reflexes within the limb all contribute to stiffness and are affected by the nervous system. The stiffness of a limb is dependent on its configuration or joint arrangement. For example, an arm that is slightly bent, it will deform more easily under a force directed from the hand to the shoulder than an arm that is straight. In this way, the stiffness of a limb is partially dictated by the limb's posture. This component of limb stiffness is due to the mechanics of the limb and is controlled voluntarily. = Voluntary vs. involuntary stiffness modulation = Some components of limb stiffness are under voluntary control while others are involuntary. The determining factor as to whether a component of stiffness is controlled voluntarily or involuntarily is the timescale of that particular component's method of action. For example, stiffness corrections that happen very quickly (80-100 milliseconds) are involuntary while slower stiffness corrections and adjustments are under voluntary control. Many of the voluntary stiffness adjustments are controlled by the motor cortex while involuntary adjustments can be controlled by reflex loops in the spinal cord or other parts of the brain. Stiffness adjustments due to reflexes are involuntary and are controlled by the spinal cord while posture selection is controlled voluntarily. However, not each component of stiffness is strictly voluntary or involuntary. For example, Antagonistic muscle cocontraction can be either voluntary or involuntary. Additionally, because much of the legs' movements are controlled by the spinal cord and because of the larger neural delay associated with sending signals to the leg muscles, leg stiffness is more involuntarily controlled than arm stiffness. = Possible neural control models = Researchers have begun implementing controllers in into robots to control for stiffness. One such model adjusts for stiffness during robotic locomotion by virtually cocontracting antagonistic muscles about the robot's joints to modulate stiffness while a central pattern generator (CPG) controls the robot's locomotion. Other models of the neural modulation of stiffness include a feedforward model of stiffness adjustment. These models of neural control support the idea that humans use a feedforward mechanism of stiffness selection in anticipation of the required stiffness needed to accomplish a given task. Most models of the neural control of stiffness promote the idea that humans choose an optimal limb stiffness based on their environment or the task at hand. Studies postulate the humans do this in order to stabilize unstable dynamics of the environment and also to maximize the energy efficiency of a given movement. The exact method by which humans accomplish this is unknown, but impedance control has been used to give insight into how humans may choose an appropriate stiffness in different environments and as they perform different tasks. Impedance control has served as the basis for much of the work done in the area of determining how humans interact with their environment. The work of Neville Hogan has been particularly useful in this area as much of the work being done today in this area is based on his previous work.  Applications in robotics  = Neuroprosthetics and exoskeletons = air muscle actuators Knowledge of human stiffness variation and stiffness selection has influenced robotic designs as researchers attempt to design robots that act more like biological systems. In order for robots to act more like biological systems, work is being done to attempt to implement stiffness modulation in robots so that they may interact more effectively with their environment. State of the art neuroprosthetics have attempted to implements stiffness control in their robotic devices. The goal of these devices is to replace the limbs of amputees and allow the new limbs to adjust their stiffness in order to effectively interact with the environment. Additionally, robotic exoskeletons have attempted to implement similar adjustable stiffness in their devices. These robots implement stiffness control for multiple reasons. The robots must be able to interact efficiently with the external environment but they must also be able to interact safely with their human user. Stiffness modulation and impedance control can be leveraged to accomplish both of these goals. These devices achieve variable stiffness in various ways. Some devices use controllers and rigid servomotors to simulate variable stiffness. Other devices utilize specific flexible actuators to achieve a various levels of limb stiffness. = Actuation Techniques = These robotic devices are able to achieve variable stiffness through various mechanisms such as simulating stiffness variation through control of stiff actuators or by utilizing variable stiffness actuators. Variable stiffness actuators mimic biological organisms by changing their inherent stiffness. These variable stiffness acutators are able to control their inherent stiffness in multiple ways. Some vary their stiffness much like humans do, by varying the force contribution of antagonistic mechanical muscles. Other actuators are able to adjust their stiffness by taking advantage of the properties of deformable elements housed within the actuators. By utilizing these variable stiffness actuation technologies, new robots have been able to more accurately replicate the motions of biological organisms and mimic their energetic efficiencies.

Founded in 1907, the congregation moved into its present edifice in 1910. Its current spiritual leader is Rabbi Aviezer Cohen. History Congregation Shomrei Emunah was established in 1907 by a group that included a number of Torah scholars. It published its bylaws on September 3, 1907. In the beginning, services were held in a Masonic hall at New Utrecht Avenue and 56th Street. In 1910 the congregation constructed its own building at the corner of 14th Avenue and 52nd Street. The imposing, yellow-brick edifice designed in Romanesque Revival style features a large skylight over the bimah (reader's platform). The subsequent founding of Beth El, Congregation Anshei Sfard, and Bnai Yehuda drew membership from Shomrei Emunah, leading to the latter's sobriquet as \\"The Mother of Jewish Institutions\\" in Boro Park. Congregation members also played a role in the establishment of the Yeshivas Etz Chaim (the neighborhood‚Äôs first day school) and the Israel Zion Hospital (today Maimonides Medical Center). In the early years of the congregation, the Chofetz Chaim had advised Torah scholars traveling to America that they should turn to Shomrei Emunah upon their arrival. Rabbis who have addressed the congregation include Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook and Rabbi Boruch Ber Leibowitz. Rabbinic leadership The synagogue installed its first rabbi in 1926. From 1928 to 1935 the spiritual leader was Rabbi Wolf Gold, a founder of the Williamsburg Talmud Torah and Mesivta Torah Vodaas. From 1935 through 1973, Dr. Harry I. Wohlberg, a professor of Bible and homiletic literature at Yeshiva University, was the synagogue rabbi. Wohlberg was the first rabbi to receive a lifetime contract from an American Orthodox synagogue. From 1973 through 2008, the synagogue was led by the renowned Rabbi Yaakov Pollack. Since 2008, the synagogue's spiritual leader is Rabbi Aviezer Cohen, who was educated in the Brisker tradition. Activities The synagogue made a name for itself in the Borough Park community with its strong emphasis on Torah study. In 1918 it founded a Chevra Shas (Talmud study society) and afterwards introduced other study groups on Bible, Mishnah, Midrash, Ein Yaakov, Chayei Adam, and Rif. In 1935 it inaugurated a Chevra Mishnayas U‚ÄôGemilas Chesed, which combines group study of Mishnayos with the distribution of interest-free loans to individuals and organizations. The emphasis on Torah study made the synagogue popular among former yeshiva students and residents interested in continuing their study of Torah and halakha (Jewish law) on Shabbat and during their free time; it also made the synagogue a popular stopping-point for visiting European Torah scholars. In response to news of the Kristallnacht pogrom in November 1938, Shomrei Emunah held a public gathering \\"where FDR was praised for his stance on behalf of Jews\\". In 2009 the synagogue was targeted for an anti- Jewish protest by members of the Westboro Baptist Church led by Fred Phelps.

Meditation is a platform used to achieve mindfulness. Both practices, mindfulness and meditation, have been \\"directly inspired from the Buddhist tradition\\" and have been widely promoted by Jon Kabat-Zinn. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to have a positive impact on several psychiatric problems such as depression and therefore has formed the basis of mindfulness programs such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, mindfulness- based stress reduction and mindfulness-based pain management. The applications of mindfulness meditation are well established, however the mechanisms that underlie this practice are yet to be fully understood. Mindfulness Meditation Four components of mindfulness meditation have been proposed to describe much of the mechanism of action by which mindfulness meditation may work: attention regulation, body awareness, emotion regulation, and change in perspective on the self. All of the components described above are connected to each other. For example, when a person is triggered by an external stimulus, the executive attention system attempts to maintain a mindful state. There is also a heightened body awareness such as a rapid heartbeat which triggers an emotional response. The response is then regulated so that it does not become habitual, but constantly changes from moment to moment experience. This eventually leads to a change in the perspective of the self.  Attention regulation  Anterior cingulate cortex Attention regulation is the task of focusing attention on an object, acknowledging any distractions, and then returning your focus back to the object. Some evidence for mechanisms responsible for attention regulation during mindfulness meditation are shown below. * Mindfulness meditators showed greater activation of rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). This suggests that meditators have a stronger processing of conflict/distraction and are more engaged in emotional regulation. However, as the meditators become more efficient at focused attention, regulation becomes unnecessary and consequentially decreases activation of ACC in the long term. * The cortical thickness in the dorsal ACC was also found to be greater in the gray matter of experienced meditators. * There is an increased frontal midline theta rhythm, which is related to attention demanding tasks and is believed to be indicative of ACC activation. High midline theta rhythm has been associated with lowest anxiety score in the Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS), the highest score in the extrovertive scale of the Maudsley Personality Inventory (MPI) and the lowest score in the neurotic scale of MPI. The ACC detects conflicting information coming from distractions. When a person is presented with a conflicting stimulus, the brain initially processes the stimulus incorrectly. This is known as error-related negativity (ERN). Before the ERN reaches a threshold, the correct conflict is detected by the frontocentral N2. After the correction, the rostral ACC is activated and allows for executive attention to the correct stimulus. Therefore, mindfulness meditation could potentially be a method for treating attention related disorders such as ADHD and bipolar disorder.  Body awareness  Gray matter & insula Body awareness refers to focusing on an object/task within the body such as breathing. From a qualitative interview with ten mindfulness meditators, some of the following responses were observed: \\"When I'm walking, I deliberately notice the sensations of my body moving\\" and \\"I notice how foods and drinks affect my thoughts, bodily sensations, and emotions‚Äù.H√∂lzel, B.K., Ott, U., Hempel, H., & Stark, R. (2006, May). Wie wirkt Achtsamkeit? Eine Interviewstudie mit erfahrenen Meditierenden(How does mindfulness work? An interview study with experienced meditators). Paper presented at the 24th Symposium of the Section for Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy of the German Society for Psychology, W√ºrzburg, Germany. The two possible mechanisms by which a mindfulness meditator can experience body awareness are discussed below. * Meditators showed a greater cortical thickness and greater gray matter concentration in the right anterior insula. * On the contrary, subjects who had undergone 8 weeks of mindfulness training showed no significant change in gray matter concentration of the insula, but rather an increase gray matter concentration of the temporo-parietal junction. The insula is responsible for awareness to stimuli and the thickness of its gray matter correlates to the accuracy and detection of the stimuli by the nervous system. Qualitative evidence suggests that mindfulness meditation impacts body awareness, however this component is not well characterized.  Emotion regulation  Prefrontal cortex & amygdala Emotions can be regulated cognitively or behaviorally. Cognitive regulation (in terms of mindfulness meditation) means having control over giving attention to a particular stimuli or by changing the response to that stimuli. The cognitive change is achieved through reappraisal (interpreting the stimulus in a more positive manner) and extinction (reversing the response to the stimulus). Behavioral regulation refers to inhibiting the expression of certain behaviors in response to a stimulus. Research suggests two main mechanisms for how mindfulness meditation influences the emotional response to a stimulus. * Mindfulness meditation regulates emotions via increased activation of the dorso-medial PFC and rostral ACC. * Increased activation of the ventrolateral PFC can regulate emotion by decreasing the activity of the amygdala. This was also predicted by a study that observed the effect of a person's mood/attitude during mindfulness on brain activation. Lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) is important for selective attention while ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) is involved in inhibiting a response. As noted before, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been noted for maintaining attention to a stimulus. The amygdala is responsible for generating emotions. Mindfulness meditation is believed to be able to regulate negative thoughts and decrease emotional reactivity through these regions of the brain. Emotion regulation deficits have been noted in disorders such as borderline personality disorder and depression. These deficits have been associated with reduced prefrontal activation and increased amygdala activity, which mindfulness meditation might be able to attenuate.  Pain  Pain is known to activate the following regions of the brain: the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior/posterior insula, primary/secondary somatosensory cortices, and the thalamus. Mindfulness meditation may provide several methods by which a person can consciously regulate pain. * Brown and Jones found that mindfulness meditation decreased pain anticipation in the right parietal cortex and mid-cingulate cortex. Mindfulness meditation also increased the activity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and ventromedial-prefrontal cortex (vm-PFC). Since the vm-PFC is involved in inhibiting emotional responses to stimuli, anticipation to pain was concluded to be reduced by cognitive and emotional control. * Another study by Grant revealed that meditators showed greater activation of insula, thalamus, and mid-cingulate cortex while a lower activation of the regions responsible for emotion control (medial-PFC, OFC, and amygdala). Meditators were believed to be in a mental state that allowed them to pay close attention to the sensory input from the stimuli and simultaneously inhibit any appraisal or emotional reactivity. Brown and Jones found that meditators showed no difference in pain sensitivity but rather the anticipation in pain. However, Grant's research showed that meditators experienced lower sensitivity to pain. These conflicting studies illustrate that the exact mechanism may vary with the expertise level or meditation technique.

In 2008 he was arrested in Austria and extradited to Croatia for trial on charges of embezzlement while he was responsible for state arms procurement during the Yugoslav Wars. He was sentenced to seven years in jail. Early career Zagorec was born on 22 November 1963 in Zagreb, son of Rudolf Zagorec. He studied electrical engineering before starting a military career. On 4 August 1992 he was appointed lieutenant colonel. In 1993 he worked as chauffeur for Ivan ƒåermak, at that time Assistant Minister of Defense and chief logistician of the Croatian Army. Within a few months he had succeeded his boss in this position. From 1994 to 2000 he was employed by the Croatian Ministry of Defence during the Yugoslav Wars. He was a confidant of the Croatian president Franjo Tuƒëman. He began buying equipment for the Croatian army. At that time the purchases of arms were clandestine due to a United Nations embargo, and no bills or receipts were prepared. He became head of the state-owned company Alan, which handled purchases of arms. Although he did not fight in the field, during his tenure he received many decorations and medals, more than any other general. Real estate After Tudjman died and the HDZ was defeated in the 2000 elections Zagorec had to leave all his positions. Zagorec moved to Austria in 2000, where he became involved in property development. In February 2004 his young son Tomislav was kidnapped in Zagreb, but was released soon after. Zagorec's Molteh company was behind construction of the Cascade Centar, an upscale shopping mall in Zagreb that opened in 2009. In 2007 Zagorec sold the company to the Czech-American group Ungelt/Spectrum. In 2008 his estimated wealth was ‚Ç¨26 million. In March 2010 Zagorec was on trial for unlawfully renovating a summer house that belonged to Antun ≈†porer, the former vice- president of the Zagreb City Assembly. In December 2011 he was acquitted, although Antun ≈†porer was sentenced to 18 months in prison. A scandal broke in 2010 when it was alleged that officers of the Austrian Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International had made unguaranteed loans ostensibly for real estate purchases in which large amounts had disappeared. Liechtenstein's authorities blocked six of Zagorec's bank accounts during the investigation into possible money- laundering. A trial began in March 2011. In October 2011 it was reported that the bank had recovered almost ‚Ç¨60 million of loans it had advanced to Zagorec for Croatian real-estate development projects. ‚Ç¨16.5 million was released from Liechtenstein banks accounts owned by Zagorec, and ‚Ç¨43 million was returned by his Vienna-based Aktor real-estate company. Embezzlement conviction In March 2007, Zagorec was arrested in Vienna on an international warrant issued by Croatia in which he was accused of embezzlement when he was responsible for arms procurement. He was accused of stealing over ‚Ç¨3.25 million while deputy minister of defense. Zagorec was said to have received diamonds that he was to give to a weapons dealer as a deposit for an arms purchase, but that in fact he kept for himself. He fought a series of appeals up to the Supreme Court of Austria, but did not succeed. He was arrested on 26 September 2008 and held in custody prior to being extradited. Zagorec was transferred to Zagreb in October 2008 for trial on charges of abuse of office and theft of jewels from the Defense ministry at the end of his term of office. The jewels were worth US$5 million. In March 2009 he was sentenced to seven years in jail by the Zagreb County Court. In November 2009 the Supreme Court upheld the sentence and stripped him of his rank and decorations. In September 2010, Croatian President Ivo Josipoviƒá confirmed that Zagorec and former generals Branimir Glava≈° and Mirko Norac had been stripped of their army rank. In June 2013, Zagorec was given a conditional release from prison and allowed to visit his family in Austria.

He left office on 17 November 2018 following his defeat in the 2018 presidential election, in which he sought to win a second 5-year term. As of February 2020, he was imprisoned in Maafushi Prison for money-laundering crimes.'Home Minister meets jailed ex-pres' news report in Avas Online - a news outlet registered with the Government of the Maldives - as reported on 24 Feb. 2020 [accessed on 21 June 2020] Yameen was elected president in the 2013 presidential election as the candidate of the Progressive Party (PPM), defeating Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) leader and former president Mohamed Nasheed in the second round of the re-run, after the initial election was annulled. He was the second democratically elected president of the Republic of the Maldives. Career Yameen started his government service in July 1978. Following his undergraduate studies in Beirut, Lebanon. He served first as Secretary at the Department of Finance and then as Research Officer at the Research and International Organisations Division of the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA). On his return after completing his postgraduate studies, Yameen started serving at Ministry of Trade and Industries. He held many post throughout his career at the ministry and was appointed as Minister of Trade and Industries on 11 November 1993 under president Maumoon. As the Trade Minister, Yameen helped Maldives become part of Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and other international trade and investment organisations. Under president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom Yameen held key cabinet position first as Minister of Higher Education (July 2005 ‚Äì April 2007) and then as Minister of Tourism and Civil Aviation (September 2008 ‚Äì 20 November) Entry into politics After the 2008 Maldivian presidential election the Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party leadership was throw into contentious conflicts of interest. This led to the president of the party and former president Maumoon Abdul Gayyoom to resign. Yameen left the party and created his own People's Alliance. His party contested in the 2009 Maldivian parliamentary election and won 7 seats including him and he gained support of Qasim Ibrahim. This led to Maumoon and Yameen to decided to join power and create Progressive Party of Maldives in 2011. During the 2011‚Äì12 Maldives political crisis Yameen played a major role in ousting president Mohamed Nasheed from office who he viewed as a threat to Islam and the nation. President Mohammed Waheed Hassan created new alliance with the opposition political leaders and created coalition against Mohamed Nasheed for the 2013 Presidential Election. =2013 presidential election= In the first round of voting for the 2013 Maldivian presidential election Yameen received 61,278 (29.72%) of the vote and the main opposition former president Mohamed Nasheed received 96,764 (46.93%). However, no candidates received more than the 50% which is the minimum support required to be president. Before the second round the coalition decided to back Yameen as the president against Nasheed. 111,203 (51.39%) was received by Yameen and he was sworn in as president as soon as election officials declared him the winner.  Presidency (2013‚Äì2018)  The China-Maldives Friendship Bridge (now officially named as Sinamal√© Bridge) project, which was launched in 2015, is the first of its kind in the Maldives. It is 1.4 kilometres long and 20 metres wide, linking Mal√©'s eastern edge to the western corner of Hulhul√© Island, where Velana International Airport is located. It will provide one lane for four-wheeled vehicles and one lane for motorcycles on either side. There is also a lane for pedestrians on both sides. Construction of the bridge began in 2016 and following its completion in mid-2018, the bridge will help to improve inter-island transport and economic development in the region by providing a reliable land connection for locals and holidaymakers between the capital Male, the airport, and the new youth city of Hulhumal√©. President Yameen inaugurated the Sinamale bridge on 30 August 2018. This is the first ever bridge to be constructed on the archipelago, to cover a distance of more than a kilometre. Expansion of the country's main gateway, Velana International Airport is expected to be completed within the second quarter of 2018. The project will expand and increase the capacity of the airport to handle more passengers and aircraft. This ambitious project consists of a fuel farm with a storage capacity of 45 million litres and a cargo complex with the capacity to handle 120,000 tonnes, a new Code F 3,400-meter-long, 60-meter-wide runway which is able to cater to the largest of aircraft such as Antonov An-225 and Airbus A380 and a new passenger terminal. Upon completion, the existing runway will be converted into a taxiway, reducing the turnaround time of aircraft at the airport. The new terminal is expected to increase the ability to serve around 8 million passengers from the current rate of 1.5 million passengers a year. The new international passenger terminal will consist of a floor area of 78,000 square meters, the new terminal will have 40 departure checking counters, 38 immigration counters, 12 jetties, and six aero-bridges. Other new airports are being developed to accommodate to the increase of the influx of more passengers and tourists which is expected to rise in the years to come. New regional airports are being built on islands such as Kulhudhuffushi and existing regional airports such as Gan International Airport have been converted to international airports with international airlines slowly beginning their operations. The city of Hulhumal√© was also being developed under the supervision of Yameen. The new land required for Phase II of Hulhumal√© was reclaimed at the beginning of 2014 and ever since, speedy development has followed through such as construction of roads and other necessary infrastructure. Yameen has also initiated a grand housing project called 'Hiyaa' to provide sheltering for an estimated 100,000 people. The project under the second phase of Hulhumal√©'s development will see the construction of 10,080 housing units including flats. Yameen had further pledged to improve healthcare facilities to include better treatment of cancer patients and those with heart ailments ‚Äì in addition to committing towards improving investigative, and other technical capabilities. Furthermore, the new 25-storey high-rise hospital, Dharumavantha Hospital, considered as the biggest investment for the Maldivian Health sector under Yameen's administration, will be a technologically innovative inclusion to the Maldives health sector and promises to deliver enhanced services and would utilize new and improved state-of-the-art equipment. The building is designed to 'shield' radiation while a life support system will be installed to the premises. Furthermore, six floors of the building is designated to national diagnostic center. The building will also have a fully equipped and enclosed section to store volatile chemicals. Other facilities planned to be included in the building include a gym, hydro-therapy center, rehabilitation suite along with a child care center and a swimming pool. A new medical college which meets the international standards is also being established for the first time ever under the supervision of Yameen to further revolutionize the health sector in Maldives. Two floors of the new state-of-the-art hospital is designated to the medical college to facilitate the best amenities for the students practicing their MBBS in the medical college in Maldives. In Addu, a new tertiary hospital is being completed to ensure access to top level healthcare apart from only being available in just the capital city of Mal√©. To increase the country's revenue and decrease the dependency on just tourism, Yameen also envisions that these projects will sprout a new and additional source of revenue for the economy of Maldives-medical tourism.  Human rights infringements  There were reports of large scale infringements of human rights and suppression of dissent during the presidency of Abdulla Yameen including autocratic measures like eroding freedom of association, freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and political participation. Human rights violations included mass arbitrary arrests, flogging as punishment, abuse of women, decrees blocking opposition parties from contesting elections, the arrest of Supreme Court justices, and cracked down on the media in efforts to silence critics. On 5 February 2018 President Abdulla Yameen declared a state of emergency and ordered the arrest of a number of politicians and officials including two judges of the Supreme Court of the Maldives, including Chief Justice of the Maldives Abdulla Saeed and former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. This was followed by mass arbitrary arrests of at least 141 people. In 2014, Ahmed Rilwan, a blogger and reporter for the Maldives Independent newspaper who used to criticize corruption and religious extremism was abducted and disappeared. On 23 April 2017, a popular Maldivian blogger Yameen Rasheed known for satirical commentaries on politicians was found with 34 stab wounds in the stairwell of his apartment building in Mal√©. He had received multiple death threats which he had reported to the police, but no action was taken. 2018 election Yameen was defeated by joint opposition candidate Ibrahim Mohamed Solih (of MDP) in 2018 presidential election held on 23 September 2018. Yameen conceded defeat in a televised statement aired next day.Government confirms election victory of opposition candidate Solih The Edition, 24 September 2018President Yameen addresses the nation The Edition, 24 September 2018  Alleged assassination attempts  On 28 September 2015, an explosion took place on board the presidential yacht 'Finifenmaa' carrying Yameen and his wife along with top government officials from the airport island Hulhul√© as it was nearing to dock at the presidential jetty, Izzuddeen Faalan in Mal√©. Yameen escaped unhurt, but the first lady, a presidential aide, and a bodyguard were injured. The first lady sustained minor fractures to her spine, and was hospitalized for over a month. Following the incident, government officials provided conflicting reports on the cause of the explosion. Although government officials initially pointed to a mechanical failure as a likely cause, they later claimed an international team of investigators from the U.S. FBI, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Sri Lanka ruled out this theory. The government then declared the incident an assassination attempt. The FBI later refuted this claim, stating they had found no conclusive evidence suggesting the blast was the result of an explosive device. An unnamed Sri Lankan official who suggested the blast was the result of a \\"high explosive explosion\\" did not provide further details, and although the Maldives' local probe commission cited Saudi Arabian investigators as saying there were signs of RDX, they provided no evidence to support that claim, nor have Saudi Arabian officials confirmed this conclusion. It was announced that investigations revealed that the vice president, some government officials and soldiers had been involved. They all were later found guilty and charged with high treason and terrorism resulting them being sentenced to jail. Former vice president Ahmed Adeeb was found to have illegally possessed firearms to attempt a coup by eliminating senior government officials as well as masterminding the bomb plot by ordering and bribing few soldiers to plant an IED in the yacht and destroy the evidence as soon as the yacht is taken for investigation following the explosion. However the FBI of the United States investigated the blast and stated it found no evidence for an explosion cause by a bomb.  Indictment  On 16 December 2018, the nation's high court seized $6.5 million in assets from Yameen. On 6 February 2019, Yameen was charged with theft, money laundering, and giving false statements to police. The investigation relates to a deal to lease tropical islands for hotel development, and an alleged payment of $1 million of government money through a private company, SOF Private Limited, into Yameen's personal bank account. Police also submitted a report to the nation's General Prosecutor's Office claiming, among other things, that Yameen gave false statements when he was being questioned. The Criminal Court found Yameen guilty of all charges on 8 November 2019. He was sentenced to 5 years in prison with an additional fine of 5 million dollars owed to the state.  Personal life  Yameen is the son of Sheikh Abdul Gayoom Ibrahim. He is married to Fathimath Ibrahim Didi and has three children, two sons and a daughter. His wife was injured in a reported assassination attempt on Yameen.

Reyerson, Faye Powe, p. 6. Retrieved 18 Nov 2013. was a water well built to supply drinking water to a castle. It was often the most costly and time-consuming element in the building of a castle, and its construction time could span decades. The well ‚Äì as well as any available cisterns ‚Äì provided a protected source of drinking water for the castle garrison in peace and war and also for any civil population seeking refuge during a siege. In medieval times, external wells were often poisoned, usually with a decomposing body, in order to force a garrison to surrender. But wells sunk within the castle itself could not be poisoned from outside during a siege.  Construction  Wells often had to be sunk a considerable depth in order to tap the nearest geological stratum holding sufficient water, the actual depth depending on the height of the castle and level of the groundwater. This was particularly challenging in the construction of hill castles. In addition, there was also the problem of providing sufficient oxygen for well diggers as they dug the well out of the rock by hand. In order to supply fresh air to the well diggers during construction, a dividing wall, usually of wood, was built into the well shaft, any gaps being stuffed with straw and pitch to make it as airtight as possible. Over the projecting \\"chimney\\" so formed, a fireplace was built that sucked air through the well shaft below. Fresh air (and hence oxygen) circulated through the artificially built U-shaped pipe so created, its two halves being separated by the dividing wall.

The 245th episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 20, 2013. The episode serves as a continuation of the previous episode, \\"Black Friday\\", in which the children of South Park, role-playing as characters from Game of Thrones, are split into two factions over whether to collectively purchase bargain-priced Xbox One or PlayStation 4 video game consoles at an upcoming Black Friday sale at the local mall, where Randy Marsh has been made the Captain of mall security. The story arc concludes with the following episode, \\"Titties and Dragons\\". The episode was rated TV-MA-LSV in the United States. Plot In continuation from the previous episode, the children of South Park are split into two factions over whether to purchase bargain-priced Xbox Ones or PlayStation 4s at an upcoming Black Friday sale at the South Park Mall. Kenny, role-playing as Lady McCormick, is revealed to have joined Stan's pro-PlayStation 4 faction because Cartman, who leads the pro-Xbox One faction, would not make him a princess. Meanwhile, as pre-Black Friday violence increases, the South Park Mall, where Randy Marsh has been made the Captain of security, announces that the early-shopper discount has been increased from 80% to 90%, leading to more shoppers gathering in front of the mall ahead of the sale. Cartman becomes increasingly agitated with the Xbox people's training following Kenny's betrayal, and informs a worried Kyle that he has a plan. Seeking an advantage to counter the PS4 faction's increasing ranks, Cartman contacts Microsoft, but CEO Steve Ballmer dismisses the importance of the children's conflict and the commercialization of the console wars. When Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates learns of this, he has Ballmer murdered in order to personally see to it that Xbox wins the console wars. Gates allies himself with Channel 9's Morning News correspondent Niles Lawson, promising that the Black Friday violence will ensure high ratings. Lawson, playing both sides of the conflict, then informs Sony's CEO of this during a post-coital discussion, and in response, the CEO gives Kenny a brooch that turns him into a Japanese princess. Cartman also sends Butters and Scott Malkinson to the New Mexico home of A Game of Thrones author George R. R. Martin for information on upcoming storylines, but Martin does nothing but regale the two children with plot points that emphasize male characters' penises. As Butters and Malkinson are about to leave, Martin tells them that he has connections with which he may be able to help their cause. Lawson then reports that the mall, on Martin's suggestion, has moved the Black Friday sale one week from November 29 to December 6, and is now offering 96% off purchases to the first 100 people inside the mall, an announcement that leads to a brawl outside the mall. Production Series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone stated that they struggled when deciding where to take the plot next after establishing that this would be the second episode in a three-part story arc. Originally, the episode consisted almost entirely of each console side's leader recruiting recurring characters from all throughout the series' history to join their side; crab people and underpants gnomes among others made appearances before being cut. This premise was scrapped because Parker and Stone felt it wasn't enough like the content in Game of Thrones. The Japanese Princess Kenny sequence was taken directly from the video game South Park: The Stick of Truth, which Parker and Stone worked on. Reception Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode a score of 8.4 out of 10, slightly lower than \\"Black Friday\\", saying: \\"Though not quite as strong as last week's Console War episode, 'A Song of Ass and Fire' was nevertheless entertaining and featured a number of great laugh-out-loud moments.\\" Marcus Gilmer from The A.V. Club gave the episode an A‚àí, writing that the last two episodes \\"prove there's still plenty of life left in the show\\". He wrote: \\"Among all of these bigger thematic elements are, of course, great jokes and gags: Cartman's 'wizard and a king' exchange with the Microsoft operator; the boys having to tilt Cartman to get him through the McCormick's doorway; George R. R. Martin torturing poor Butters by not letting the wiener thing go and promising the pizzas (or dragons) are on their way and will be amazing.

Tactile hallucination is the false perception of tactile sensory input that creates a hallucinatory sensation of physical contact with an imaginary object. It is caused by the faulty integration of the tactile sensory neural signals generated in the spinal cord and the thalamus and sent to the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). Tactile hallucinations are recurrent symptoms of neurological diseases such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Ekbom's syndrome and delerium tremens. Patients who experience phantom limb pains also experience a type of tactile hallucination. Tactile hallucinations are also caused by drugs such as cocaine and alcohol.  History and background  In Ancient Greek times, touch was an unrefined perceptual system. During ancient Greek times, touch was considered to be an unrefined perceptual system because it differed from the other senses on the basis of the distance and timing of perception of the stimulus. Unlike vision and audition, one perceives touch simultaneously with the medium and the stimulus is always proximal and not distal. By the 17th century, the British empiricist John Locke attributed the word \\"feeling\\" with two types of sensation. Weber distinctly identified these two types of sensation as the sense of touch and common bodily sensibility. This distinction further helped 19th century psychiatrists to distinguish between tactile hallucinations and cenesthopathy. During the 19th century, tactile hallucinations were classified as symptoms associated with insanity, organic and toxic syndromes and delusional parasitosis yet there was no identification on how such hallucinations were caused. Currently, neuroscientists such as Dr. Oliver Sacks and Dr. V.S. Ramachandran have analyzed and attributed tactile hallucinations as a dysfunctional perception of the brain as opposed to just a symptom related to insanity. They have contributed significantly to propose tactile hallucinations as the false perception of tactile sensory input creating a sensation of touch with an imaginary object.  Tactile hallucinations in schizophrenia  Hallucinations of pain and touch are very rare in schizophrenic disorders but 20% of patients with schizophrenia experience some sort of tactile hallucinations along with visual and auditory hallucinations. The most common tactile hallucination in patients with schizophrenia is a sensation in which a patch of their skin is stretched elastically across their head. They vary in intensity, range and speed at which they feel this stretching painful sensation. They are usually triggered by emotional cues such as guilt, anger, fear and depression. Other types of tactile hallucinations takes on a sexual form in patients with schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia may sometimes experience the feeling of being kissed or the feeling of someone lying by their side in response to their emotion of being lonely. Additionally, they occasionally hallucinate the feeling of small animals such as snakes crawling over their body. Such vivid tactile sensation of an object that is not present results from the unsuccessful attempt of the brain trying to perceive objects that are novel and that represent unreal situations usually triggered by guilt and fear. Patients with schizophrenia also have a hard time portraying emotions as they divert most of their energy to control the pain from their tactile hallucinations. Olfactory and tactile hallucinations correlate with one another in terms of prevalence in patients with schizophrenia. One particular study was conducted by Langdon et al., in which the prevalence of olfactory hallucinations and tactile hallucinations was analyzed in two distinct clinical samples of patients with schizophrenia. One of the samples contained patients with schizophrenia with tactile hallucinations as reported by the World Health Organization while the other sample contained cases with negative and positive types of tactile hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia. It was concluded that about 13% to 17% of patients with schizophrenia experience olfactory and tactile hallucinations. The study reported that socio-cultural factors influenced self-reporting of tactile hallucinations. Since hallucinations in general were feared as a symptoms of insanity, patients were reluctant to seek help for such symptoms. Moreover, the study concluded that tactile hallucinations were usually accompanied by several other hallucinations associated with different modalities such as taste and sight. However, the study failed to recognize the pathophysiology of tactile hallucinations in individuals with schizophrenia.  Tactile hallucinations in Parkinson's disease  Trihexyphenidyl: An antiparkinsonian agent that creates tactile hallucinations. About 7% of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) also experience mild or severe types of tactile hallucinations. Most of these hallucinations are based on the sensation of a particular kind of animal. Several case studies were conducted by F√©nelon and his colleagues on patients with PD that had tactile hallucinations. One of his patients described that he sensed \\"spiders and cockroaches chewing on his lower limb\\" which was rather painful. Several other patients felt that there was a parasitic infestation of their skin which caused lesions on their skins due to the obsessive need of itching. F√©nelon also analyzed the particular types of tactile hallucinations experienced, the timing of such experience and certain drugs that could eliminate such experience. It was concluded that patients with both PD and tactile hallucinations not only experienced sensations elicited by insects under their skin but also by vivid tactile sensations of people. These hallucinations were aggravated during evening times due to altered arousal states and were alleviated by dopaminergic treatment such as the intake of clozapine. The study also explains that the pathophysiology of tactile hallucinations is uncertain, however, such hallucinations can be attributed to narcoleptic rapid eye movement sleep disorders due to its concordance with visual hallucinations. Moreover, it emphasizes that individuals who have had PD for a longer period of time have a more severe form of tactile hallucinations than with individuals who have succumbed to this disease for just a short period of time. Clinical drugs used as an antiparkinsonian agent such as Trihexyphenidyl are known to create tactile hallucinations in patients with PD.  Tactile hallucinations in restless legs syndrome  Hallucinatory itch due to sensation of insects under the skin leading to self-hurting behavior. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) causes unpleasant or uncomfortable sensations in the legs and an irresistible urge to move them. Tactile hallucinations in RLS include feelings of itching, pulling, crawling or creeping mainly in the legs, with the accompanying overwhelming urge to move them. These symptoms are more prominent in the late afternoon and at night, often causing insomnia. The causes of RLS are generally unknown, though there are three major hypotheses: iron deficiency, dopamine insufficiency and genetic inheritance. RLS can also occur due to nerve damage, or neuropathy. Treatments for RLS typically focus on symptom relief through supplementing iron, blocking nerve receptors through the use of alpha-2 delta drugs such as gabapentin, or through the use of opioids or benzodiazepines.  Tactile hallucination in phantom limbs  Treatments for phantom limb pains: Virtually Painless- Science Museum Painless Exhibition Series. Phantom limb pain is a type of tactile hallucination because it creates a sensation of excruciating pain in a limb that has been amputated. In 1996, VS Ramachandran conducted a research on several amputees to pinpoint the neural reasons behind these illusionary pains. Most of these amputees that had an unbearable phantom limb pain are reported by patients whose limb was paralyzed before amputation. VS Ramachandran proposed the \\"learned paralysis\\" hypothesis. The hypothesis suggested that every time the patients tried to move their paralyzed limb, they received sensory feedback (through vision and proprioception) that the limb did not move. This feedback hardwired itself into the brain circuitry, so that, even when the limb was no longer present, the brain had learned that the phantom limb was paralyzed. As a treatment for phantom limb pains, VS Ramachandran devised a mirror box that would superimpose the mirror image of the normal arm in place of the missing arm and the patient would immediately be relieved of the pain. This suggested that the brain had a plastic nature in the somatosensory system and the brain had reorganized its somatosensory region to accommodate for this new change. Patients that experience this phantom limb pain are very important in research studies for their role in determining brain plasticity. The vivid tactile sensation of the arm that is no longer present suggest the highly complex nature of the brain to reorganize different functions which were once thought to be hardwired to specific regions (localization).  Drug-induced tactile hallucinations  Photo of cocaine Organic and toxic syndromes can also induce tactile hallucinations. The use of cocaine for recreational purposes has been reported to induce tactile hallucinations. They usually have sensations of moving itches and crawling insects. Cocaine and alcohol can induce rapid firing of neuronal cells of the somatosensory region of the brain leading to vivid perception of illusionary bugs on the skin. Additionally, as mentioned above, Trihexyphenidyl is an antiparkinsonian drug that creates tactile hallucination. The mechanism through which these drugs induce tactile hallucinations is still unknown.  Cenesthopathic tactile hallucinations  Cenesthopathy is a rare medical term used to refer to the feeling of being ill and this feeling is not localized to one region of the body. Cenesthopathic hallucinatory experiences are caused by the hyperactive neuronal stimulation of the primary somatosensory cortex due to a disorder or a damage to this area. There are two theories that are established to portray sensation of unified bodily feeling. One of these theories is called associationism, which states that cenesthesia is an amalgamation of propioceptive and interoceptive sensations. Faculty psychology is the other theory which states that there is a particular brain region where all of the sensory information converged and the integration of this information gives one cenesthetic sensation. The latter theory became more predominant and it established two types of cenestopathic hallucinations namely \\"painful\\" and \\"paraesthetic\\". Patients that experience \\"painful\\" type of cenesthopathic hallucination felt that their organs were stretched apart and twisted. On the other hand, patients with \\"paraesthetic\\" cenesthopathic hallucination experience severe hallucinatory itching.  Pathophysiology  Schematic and FMRI of cortical areas involved in pain processing which are similar to areas that are involved in tactile hallucinations. Tactile hallucinations are the result of a dysfunctional somatosensory and a dysfunctional awareness regions of the brain. Tactile sensory input is produced and conducted through the spinal cord and thalamus and it is received at the primary somatosensory cortex. Once it has reached the primary somatosensory cortex, it is distributed across the brain and it will not be processed unless it is important and one pays close attention to the information based on a specific context. Consciousness to these specific tactile sensations is generated only through multiple feedback loops passing through higher cortical areas such as secondary somatosensory area, parietal, insular cortex and premotor areas. The intensity of the tactile stimulus is directly proportional to the area of the primary somatosensory region activated. A feedback mechanism from different cortical areas results in the awareness of touch. Even with complete sensory deprivation, discrete tactile memories can trigger spontaneous firing of impaired neurons. Therefore, individuals with various psychiatric disorders are more prone to tactile hallucinations than normal individuals. : Tactile hallucinations are especially possible due to faulty sensory integration of neuronal signals in the primary and secondary somatosensory system with neuronal signals in the parietal cortex, insular cortex and premotor cortex. Moreover, the posterior insula is responsible for mental body schema representation and can produce tactile hallucination if defected. Additionally, the regions of the brain involved in tactile hallucinations are similar to the regions of the brain involved in pain.

There are three major network oscillation patterns in the hippocampus: theta waves, SWRs and gamma waves. Gamma oscillations are found in all major brain structures, whereas theta and sharp waves are specific to the hippocampus and its neighbouring areas. SWRs are composed of large amplitude sharp waves in local field potential and associated fast field oscillations known as ripples. SWRs are shown to be involved in memory consolidation and the replay of wakefulness- acquired memory. These network oscillations are the most synchronous patterns in the brain, making them susceptible to pathological patterns such as epilepsy. History and background Neuronal oscillations are important components of neuroscience research. During the last two decades, hippocampal oscillations have been a major focus in the research of neuronal oscillations. Among different oscillations present in the brain, SWRs are the first and only population activity that start in the developing hippocampus, but they are the least understood network pattern of the hippocampus. Originally, these large waves were observed by Cornelius Vanderwolf in 1969, and later John O'Keefe investigated SPW-Rs in more detail in 1978 while studying the spatial memory of rats. Gy√∂rgy Buzs√°ki and his collaborators studied and characterized SWRs in detail and described their physiological functions and role in different states of the animal. These patterns are large amplitude, aperiodic recurrent oscillations occurring in the apical dendritic layer of the CA1 regions of the hippocampus. Sharp waves are followed by synchronous fast field oscillations (140‚Äì200 Hz frequency), named ripples. Features of these oscillations provided evidences for their role in inducing synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. Among these features are their widespread effect on the population neurons in the hippocampus, and the experience-dependent content of participating neurons. Studies have shown that elimination of SWRs by electrical stimulation interfered with rats ability to recall the spatial memory information. These features support functional role of sharp waves and ripples in memory consolidation. Hippocampal formation =Structures= Circuit Hippocampal circuit in rodent hippocampus. Connections between CA3 and CA1 regions with parahippocampal structures is shown. The trisynaptic loop, as the main circuit of the hippocampus responsible for information transfer between the hippocampus and the cortex, is also the circuit producing SWRs. This circuit provides the pathway by which SWRs affect the cortical areas, and also receive inputs from them. Consequently, this loop is shown to be the pathway responsible for conversion of short term memory to long term memory. The trisynaptic loop of the hippocampus is one of the most thoroughly studied circuits for long-term potentiation. Participant neuronal populations Emergence of these self-organized hippocampal events are dependent on interactions between various pyramidal and granule neurons with different types of the interneurons in this circuit. Pyramidal cells of CA3 and CA1 dendritic layer region are important in generating these waves, and they affect the subiculum, parasubiculum, entorhinal cortex, and ultimately neurons of the neocortex. During SWRs, which last approximately 100 milliseconds, 50,000-100,000 neurons discharge in synchrony, making SWRs the most synchronous event in the brain. An important concept about the neuronal populations participating in these events is the fact that they are experience-dependent. Sequences that have been active during the animal's activity are the ones participating in SWRs. Activity naturally spreads along the pathways that have stronger synapses. This is one of the features of SWRs providing evidence for their role in memory consolidation. =Network mechanisms of generation= Self-emergent network Population bursts of pyramidal cells in the CA3 region of the hippocampus via CA3 collaterals cause depolarization of pyramidal cells in the dendritic layer of the CA1 which give rise to extracellular negative waves‚Äìthe sharp waves‚Äìfollowed by fast ripples. Discharge of pyramidal cells of CA3 region also activates the GABAergic interneurons. Sparse firing of CA1 pyramidal cells and in-phase inhibition from the activated interneurons, give rise to high frequency (200 Hz) network oscillations, which are the ripples. CA1 population bursts lead to highly synchronized activity in the target population of parahippocampal structures. Effects of neocortical inputs sleep spindle and K-complex in EEG In spite of the self-emergent nature of the SWRs, their activity could be altered by inputs from the neocortex via the trisynaptic loop to the hippocampus. Activity of the neocortex during slow wave sleep is deterministic of inputs to the hippocampus; thalamocortical sleep spindles and delta waves are the sleep patterns of the neocortex. These inputs contribute to the selection of different neuronal assemblies for initiation of SWRs, and affect the timing of the SWRs. Different thalamocortical neuronal assemblies give rise to sleep spindles, and these cell assemblies affect the burst initiator for the sharp waves. In this manner, thalamocortical inputs affect the content of the SWRs going to neocortex. Memory consolidation Sharp waves and associated ripples are present in the mammalian brains of the species that have been investigated for this purpose, including mice, rats, rabbits, monkeys and humans. In all of these species, they have been shown primarily to be involved in consolidation of recently acquired memories during the immobility and slow wave sleep. Characteristics of these oscillations, such as having experience dependent neuronal content, being affected by the cortical input, and reactivating neocortical pathways formed through recent experiences, provides evidences for their role in memory consolidation. Besides, some direct evidences for their role come from studies, investigating effects of their removal. Animal studies indicated that depletion of ripple activity by electrical stimulation, would impair formation of new memories in rats. Furthermore, in spatially non-demanding tasks, such as passive exploration, optogenetic disruption of SPW-R events interferes with the stabilisation of the newly formed hippocampal place cell code (ref, but see ref). As for humans, what is currently known is that the hippocampus as a whole is important for memory consolidation. The most famous human patient with hippocampal lesion is H.M., whose hippocampus has been removed from both sides of his brain. Studies conducted on HM have clearly proven the role of the hippocampus in shaping the long-term memory. Investigations also provide strong evidence supporting role of the hippocampus in consolidation of specific types of memories such as declarative and spatial memories. However, clear evidence for the role of SPW-R events in memory consolidation in the hippocampus of humans is still missing. =Two stage model of memory= Based on the research findings about SPW-Rs, in 1989 an influential two stage model of memory proposed by Buzs√°ki, that subsequent evidences supported it. Based on this model initial memories of the events are formed during the acquisition and reinforced during replay. Acquisition occurs by theta and gamma waves activating a neuronal pathway for initial formation of the memory. Later this pathway would get replayed following the SPW-Rs propagation to neocortex. Neuronal sequences during replay happen in a faster rate and are in both forward and reverse direction of the initial formation. Ripples and fast gamma In spite of the fact that hippocampal ripples (140-220 Hz) and fast gamma (90‚Äì150 Hz) oscillations have similar mechanisms of generation, they are two distinct patterns in the hippocampus. They are both produced as the response of the CA1 region to inputs from the CA3 region. Ripples are only present when theta waves are relatively absent during sharp waves, whereas fast gamma waves occur during theta waves and sharp waves. The magnitude and frequency of both ripples and fast gamma patterns are dependent on the magnitude of hippocampal sharp waves. Stronger excitation from sharp waves results in ripple oscillations, whereas weaker stimulations generate fast gamma patterns. Besides they are shown to be region dependent, ripples that are the fastest oscillations are present in the CA1 region pyramidal cells while gamma oscillations dominate in CA3 region and parahippocampal structures. Disease state =Epilepsy= In addition to ongoing research on the role of SPW-R complexes in memory consolidation and neuronal plasticity, another major area of the attention is their role in development of epilepsy. As mentioned before, SPW-Rs are the most synchronous oscillations observed in the brain; which implies any abnormal activity in this network would bring significant consequences. One of the deviations from normal activity is fast ripples. Fast ripples are a pathologic pattern that emerges from the physiologic ripples. These fast ripples are field potentials of hyper-synchronous bursting of excitatory neurons pyramidal cells at frequencies between 250‚Äì600 Hz. Fast ripples activities in the hippocampus considered as pathologic patterns directly associated with epilepsy, but they appear as both physiologic and pathologic activity in neocortex. Although underlying physiology and identifying contributions of fast ripples in generation of seizures are still under investigation and further research, studies are suggesting that fast ripples could be used as a biomarker of epileptogenic tissues.

After initial service in the Atlantic the ship transferred to Seattle in 1907 to begin survey work in Alaskan waters during summer and more southern waters in winter. On return from the Navy the ship was condemned and due to be sold. Instead the ship was retained as a survey vessel into the fall of 1939 and existed into World War II when it saw service with the United States Army Corps of Engineers as Atkins. Description as built Explorer was built by Pusey & Jones of Wilmington, Delaware as hull number 316 and delivered to the Coast & Geodetic Survey on 30 November 1904. The ship was schooner rigged with two masts with sails to steady the ship, not propulsion, which was by means of an engine with cylinders and with a stroke driving a single bronze propeller. A diameter by long boiler provided steam. Wood was the primary material with metal used only when needed and where it could be used \\"without defeating the purpose of the wooden hull\\".In operation the ship did extensive magnetic survey work in which extensive metal would distort observations. The hull was length overall, length between perpendiculars, extreme beam with a depth of . Displacement was 450 tons on a mean draft of . 1906 registry information shows a vessel of , signal letters GVWJ, speed of , 85 ton coal capacity and a crew of seven officers and 36 men. Coast & Geodetic Survey service The ship was placed in commission 29 December 1904 but was weather bound in Wilmington until 9 March 1905 at which time the ship sailed for Puerto Rico. Explorer made magnetic observations at Norfolk and during the remainder of the voyage. Work was then commenced on hydrographic surveys and updating Coast Pilot information. The ship returned to Baltimore, making magnetic observations during the voyage, on 21 June 1905 where repairs were made. The ship left Baltimore 26 July 1905 reaching Rockland, Maine on 30 July to begin surveys lasting until 2 November when Explorer returned to Baltimore for repairs before sailing on 4 January 1906 for a winter survey season of the south coast of Puerto Rico arriving there on 20 January taking magnetic observations on the voyage. The southern surveys ended on 28 May with arrival at Baltimore on 5 June where repairs were undertaken. Explorer left Baltimore for northern surveys on 23 July 1906 working until the end of the season on 11 December and return to Baltimore on 15 December for repairs before a major transfer in operations. On 19 February 1907 the ship departed Baltimore for Seattle by way of the Straits of Magellan making magnetic observations during the voyage. On 3 July 1907 the ship reached San Diego and arrived in Seattle 15 July. On 17 August the ship sailed for Alaska to begin series of surveys in northern waters during summer and more southern portions of the west coast in winter. On 12 November 1907 her launch was run down by the steamer in thick fog at Seattle, Washington. Two of four crewmen in the launch drowned in the incident. Explorer was transferred to the US Navy on 22 May 1918 and commissioned as USS Explorer on 3 June 1918. The ship was assigned patrol the canneries and fishing grounds of Alaska, including Prince William Sound, until ordered to be returned to the Survey on 31 March 1919. The ship. along with USC&GS; Patterson and Navy submarine chasers 309 and 310, was assigned the patrol duty as a result of rumors of German and Industrial Workers of the World activity among the cannery and fishery workers. On return from the Navye Explorer was condemned and to be sold. The USC&GS; Director's annual report covering 1 July 1919 to 30 June 1920 contained an entire section dealing with the urgent need to survey Alaskan waters to enable commerce to develop in the territory. The shortage and limitations of vessels was emphasized. Explorer had been laid up in Seattle since its return from the Navy and was put back in commission for USC&GS; work in February 1920. The ship was equipped for wire drag survey and as mother ship for smaller vessels and assigned and ScandinaviaScandinavia (SP 3363) during naval service. which had both been repaired after their naval service. The vessels proceeded to Alaska for triangulation, topographic and hydrographic survey of Stephens Passage. Explorer continued in service and appears in the Coast and Geodetic Survey annual reports and the United States registry under \\"Vessels of the Coast and Geodetic Survey\\" into 1939. Transfer to other agencies Explorer, working in Puget Sound in the fall of 1939, was transferred to the National Youth Administration after service of thirty-five years as the new was due to begin service in spring. Explorer was acquired and converted in 1941 by the US Army and renamed Atkins (FS 237) whereupon the United States Army Corps of Engineers used her for survey work.

In 1965 he came back to take an MA degree at Strathclyde in Management, then won a UK Government Fellowship to study Management on a 1-year tenure at the University of Chicago. He was then appointed to a Lectureship in Engineering Management at Strathclyde (1967‚Äì70), where he also graduated with a PhD degree, before becoming Senior Lecturer and Head of Department of Production Management at the University of Glasgow (1970‚Äì73). In 1973 he was appointed Professor of Manufacturing Organisation at Loughborough University. He was next appointed, in 1981, to be Professor of Engineering Manufacture at Imperial College London, and was head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Imperial from 1983 to 1990. He also established the Centre for Robotics and Automated Systems at Imperial and was its Director from 1982 to 1990. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1988. He moved to the University of Salford in 1990, serving as Vice-Chancellor until 1997. During his tenure at Salford he was a Director at the Manchester Royal Exchange Theatre, a Council Member of the Engineering Council, a member of the Manchester Steering Group for the Commonwealth Games and a Trustee of the Granada Foundation. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Manchester in 1990. After his retirement from Salford he took on a range of roles including Chairman of the East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, Chairman of UKERNA, an expert adviser to the Swedish Government on their Nutek Programme and membership of the Governing Body of Bournemouth University.

It contains a single species, Chalawan thailandicus, with Chalawan shartegensis as a possible second species. Discovery and history Chalawan is currently known solely from its holotype, a nearly complete lower jaw collected in the early 1980s from a road-cut near the town of Nong Bua Lamphu, in the upper part of the Phu Kradung Formation. This single specimen is the most well preserved vertebrate fossil that has been found from the formation; other vertebrates, including dinosaurs, are known only from fragmentary remains. This formation was originally considered to be Early to Middle Jurassic in age, however its age has been revised and except for its lowermost part which was probably deposited during the Late Jurassic, is now considered Early Cretaceous. The specimen was originally assigned to a new species of the goniopholidid Sunosuchus. Sunosuchus thailandicus was first described and named by Eric Buffetaut and Rucha Ingavat in 1980. The mandible is very robust, and its tip is spoon shaped and wider than the portion of the jaw immediately behind it. Buffetaut and Ingavat (1980‚Äì1984) noted that S. thailandicus shares features with both goniopholidids and pholidosaurids, and considered it an indication of a close relation between the two groups. Andrade et al. (2011) found S. thailandicus to be the only species of Sunosuchus, apart from its type species Sunosuchus miaoi, and possibly also \\"Goniopholis\\" phuwiangensis from Thailand, which they reassigned to Sunosuchus. Even though this was based on the results of the largest phylogenetic analysis available for mesoeucrocodylians, due to the fragmentary nature of the holotypes of S. thailandicus and \\"G.\\" phuwiangensis these assignments were weakly supported. Halliday et al. (2013) tentatively synonymized \\"Sunosuchus\\" shartegensis (Efimov, 1988) as \\"Sunosuchus\\" cf. thailandicus. \\"S.\\" shartegensis is known solely from the holotype PIN 4174‚Äí1, a fragmented skull, comprising the rostrum, the preorbital region of the skull roof, the quadrates and parts of the quadratojugal, the occipital condyle and nearly complete mandibles. It was collected from \\"Layer 2\\" of the Tithonian (Late Jurassic) Ulan Malgait beds, in the Shar Teeg locality, of the Govi- Altai Province of Outer Mongolia, embedded in grey clay. Halliday et al. (2013) stated that \\"S.\\" shartegensis shares some features with other species of Sunosuchus, and can not be differentiated from the holotype of S. thailandicus. Nevertheless, it lacks definitive synapomorphies of S. thailandicus, and possibly even these of Goniopholididae, suggesting that it might belong to a different species. Using an updated version of Andrade et al. (2011) phylogenetic analysis, Halliday et al. (2013) found \\"S.\\" shartegensis to be the sister taxon of Kansajsuchus from Tajikistan. The addition of S. thailandicus (based on the holotype) to the analysis did not confirm the referral of \\"S.\\" shartegensis to \\"S.\\" cf. thailandicus, as it resulted in a large polytomy. An alternative generic name for S. thailandicus was proposed by Jeremy E. Martin, Komsorn Lauprasert, Eric Buffetaut, Romain Liard and Varavudh Suteethorn in 2013 following the discovery of cranial elements associated with the mandibular remains, creating the combinatio nova Chalawan thailandicus. The generic name is derived from the name of Chalawan, a giant in the Thai folktale of Krai Thong that could take the form of a crocodile with diamond teeth. A premaxilla, among the newly discovered material, led to the reassignment of Chalawan to the Pholidosauridae. Additionally, Chalawan and both Goniopholididae and Pholidosauridae share the presence of a depression located on the lateral wall of the maxilla and jugal bone. Martin et al. (2013) first appeared online only several months after Halliday et al. (2013), therefore the influence of the newly discovered material on the taxonomic status of \\"S.\\" shartegensis is yet unknown.

A portion of those amounts along with a portion of fees from renewable energy projects on federal lands would be available to the agency, subject to appropriation, to cover the costs of activities aimed at increasing energy development on federal lands. The bill also would exempt lawsuits related to energy production on federal lands from the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA). In addition, the legislation would require the BLM to offer for sale at least 25 percent of onshore federal lands nominated by firms for oil and gas leasing. It was introduced in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. President Barack Obama threatened to veto the bill on November 19, 2013. Provisions of the bill The goal of the bill is to make \\"it easier for oil and gas companies to obtain drilling permits on federal lands.\\" If this bill were to take effect, the United States Department of the Interior would then be forced to reject or approve onshore drilling permits within 60 days of the permit applications being submitted. If the Department fails to issue a ruling in that time window, the permit is automatically approved. The bill would also make it more difficult for people to fight against drilling. The bill would create a \\"$5,000 dollar fee to lodge a formal protest of leases or drilling permits awarded to oil and gas producers.\\" The bill would also establish a minimum amount of federal land that must be offered for oil-and-gas leases. Congressional Research Service summary This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Security Act would amend the Mineral Leasing Act to revise requirements for the issuance of permits to drill in energy projects on federal lands. The bill would authorize the United States Secretary of the Interior to extend the initial 30-day permit application review period for up to 2 periods of 15 days each, if the Secretary has given written notice of the delay to the applicant. The bill would deem a permit application approved if the Secretary has not made a decision on it by 60 days after its receipt. It would prescribe a notice requirement for denial of an application. The bill would require the Secretary to collect a single $6,500 permit processing fee per application from each applicant at the time the decision is made whether or not to issue a permit. The bill would require that specified minimum percentages of fees collected as annual wind energy and solar energy right-of-way authorization fees be available for the local Department of the Interior field office where they are collected, for Bureau of Land Management (BLM) permit approval activities, and to the Secretary for department-wide permitting activities. The bill would require the Secretary to collect a $5,000 documentation fee to accompany each protest for a lease, right of way, or application for permit to drill. The bill would require the Secretary to: (1) establish a Federal Permit Streamlining Project in every BLM Field office with responsibility for permitting energy projects on federal land, and (2) enter into a related memorandum of understanding with the United States Secretary of Agriculture, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Chief of the Army Corps of Engineers. The bill would require federal signatories to such memorandum to assign staff with special expertise to BLM field offices. The bill would state that the Secretary shall not require a finding of extraordinary circumstances related to a categorical exclusion in administering the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPA 2005) with respect to review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). (A \\"categorical exclusion\\" under NEPA is a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a federal agency in implementing environmental regulations and for which, therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.) The bill would set forth procedures for judicial review of leasing of federal lands for the exploration, development, production, processing, or transmission of oil, natural gas, wind, or any other energy source of energy. The bill would direct the Secretary, in conducting lease sales under the Mineral Leasing Act, to offer for sale at least 25% of the annual nominated acreage not previously made available for lease. The bill would shield such acreage from protest and the test of extraordinary circumstances, but makes it eligible for certain categorical exclusions under EPA 2005 and NEPA. The bill would amend the Mineral Leasing Act to prohibit the Secretary from: (1) withdrawing any covered energy project issued under that Act without finding a violation of lease terms by the lessee; (2) delaying indefinitely issuance of project approvals, drilling and seismic permits, and rights of way for activities under a lease; and (3) cancelling or withdrawing any lease parcel after a competitive lease sale has occurred and a winning bidder has made the last payment for the parcel. The bill would instruct the Secretary to: (1) make nominated areas available for lease within 18 months after an area is designated as open under a current land use plan, (2) issue all leases sold 60 days after the last payment is made, and (3) adjudicate any lease protests filed following a lease sale. The bill would prohibit additional lease stipulations (except certain emergency stipulations) after the parcel is sold without consultation and agreement of the lessee. The bill would require federal land managers to follow existing resource management plans and continue to actively lease in areas designated as open when resource management plans are being amended or revised, until such time as a new record of decision is signed. The bill would declare without force or effect Bureau of Land Management Instruction Memorandum 2010-117. The bill would deem the final regulations regarding oil shale management published by the BLM on November 18, 2008, to satisfy all legal and procedural requirements under any law, including the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, NEPA, and EPA 2005. It would direct the Secretary of the Interior to implement those regulations, including the oil shale leasing program they authorize, without any other administrative action necessary. It would deem the November 17, 2008, U.S. Bureau of Land Management Approved Resource Management Plan Amendments/Record of Decision for Oil Shale and Tar Sands Resources to Address Land Use Allocations in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement also to satisfy all legal and procedural requirements under any law. Directs the Secretary to implement the oil shale leasing program in those areas covered by the resource management plans amended by such amendments, and covered by such record of decision, without any other administrative action necessary. The bill would direct the Secretary to hold a lease sale, within 180 days after enactment of this Act, that offers an additional 10 parcels for lease for research, development, and demonstration of oil shale resources under the terms offered in the solicitation of bids for such leases published on January 15, 2009. The bill would require the Secretary, by January 1, 2016, to hold at least 5 separate commercial lease sales, in multiple lease blocs, in areas of at least 25,000 acres, which: (1) have been nominated through public comment, and (2) are considered to have the most potential for oil shale development. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on July 24, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 1965 would require the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to establish certain fees for activities related to the development of oil and gas on federal lands. A portion of those amounts along with a portion of fees from renewable energy projects on federal lands would be available to the agency, subject to appropriation, to cover the costs of activities aimed at increasing energy development on federal lands. The bill also would exempt lawsuits related to energy production on federal lands from the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA). In addition, the legislation would require the BLM to offer for sale at least 25 percent of onshore federal lands nominated by firms for oil and gas leasing. Finally, the bill would establish a commercial leasing program for oil shale resources (a type of rock that can be heated to extract an organic compound used to produce synthetic crude oil) on federal lands. Based on information provided by the BLM, the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of the Treasury, and certain environmental groups, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that enacting the legislation would increase offsetting receipts, which are treated as reductions in direct spending, by $325 million over the 2014-2023 period; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. In addition, the CBO estimated that implementing the legislation would cost $186 million over the 2014-2018 period and $329 million over the 2014-2023 period, assuming appropriation of the authorized and necessary amounts. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues. H.R. 1965 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Security Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives by Rep. Doug Lamborn (R, CO-5) on May 14, 2013. It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources, the United States House Committee on the Judiciary, the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, and the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law. The House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources held hearings about the bill on May 22, 2013. Jamie Connell testified at the hearing on behalf of the Bureau of Land Management. On July 24, 2013, the House Committee on Natural Resources ordered reported (amended) the bill by a vote of 27-14 alongside House Report 113-262 part 1. On November 15, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that the bill would be considered on November 19, 2013. In addition to considering the bill, the House as a whole would also consider eight proposed amendments. On November 19, 2013, the White House threatened to veto the bill. Debate and discussion The Department of the Interior opposed the bill, citing why in testimony before the House Natural Resources Committee Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources. On November 19, 2013, President Barack Obama released a statement that his administration \\"strongly opposes\\" the bill, because it \\"favor an arbitrary standard for leasing in open areas over leasing on the basis of greatest resource potential; limit the public's opportunity to engage in decisions about the use of public lands; raise the potential for costly litigation, protests, and delays; strip the ability of the Department of the Interior to issue permits to drill based on important environmental reviews, clearances and tribal consultation; and curtail the use of public lands for other uses like hunting, fishing, and recreation.\\" President Obama threatened to veto the bill.

Since 1938, it has been a major artifact in the British Museum's Middle East collection.British Museum Collection Description Royal inscriptions like the East India House Inscription were intended for public display or burial in the foundations of buildings. Unlike most cuneiform writing that was made in clay, foundation tablets like this were carved in stone and were more carefully articulated, the scribes clearly taking pride in the beauty and clarity of their engraving. This text was probably originally buried in the foundations of one of King Nebuchadnezzar's numerous constructions in Babylon between 604 and 562 BC. The dimensions of the tablet measure 56.5 cm by 50.2 cm, with a thickness of 9.52 cm. History of the Find The tablet was unearthed before 1803 in the ruins of Babylon by Sir Harford Jones Brydges, then British Resident in Baghdad. Later, Brydges presented it to the museum of East India House. It has since been known as the East India House Inscription. The tablet was eventually donated to the British Museum when the collections of East India House museum were dispersed. Inscription Detail of the Inscription A translation of the first section of the inscription is described below: \\"I am Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, the exalted prince, the favourite of the god Marduk, the beloved of the god Nabu, the arbiter, the possessor of wisdom, who reverences their lordship, the untiring governor who is constantly anxious for the maintenance of the shrines of Babylonia and Borsippa, the wise, the pious, the son of Nabopolasser, king of Babylon; To Marduk, my lord I make supplication; Oh eternal prince, lord of all being, guide in a straight path the king whom thou lovest and whose name thou hast proclaimed as was pleasing to thee. I am the prince, the favourite, the creature of thy hand. Thou hast created me and entrusted me with dominion over all people. According to thy favour lord, which thou dost bestow on all people, cause me to love thy exalted lordship. Create in my heart, the worship of your divinity, and grant whatever is pleasing to thee because thou hast my life; By thy command, merciful Marduk, may the temple I have built endure for all time and may I be satisfied with its splendour; in its midst may I attain old age, may I be sated with offspring; therein may I receive the heavy tribute of all mankind; from the horizon of heaven to the zenith, may I have no enemies; may my descendants live therein forever and rule over the people.\\" Further reading *S.

The term also refers to descendants of diasporic Arabians such as descendants of Arab merchants to Asian nations, whose ancestral origins may be traced to merchants hailing from the Southern Arabian nations such as Yemen and Oman and the Arab nations of the Persian gulf region. Most Arab New Zealanders are of Lebanese and Iraqi descent because they were the first Arabs to arrive in New Zealand. Therefore, an Arab New Zealander is a New Zealander of Arab cultural and linguistic heritage or identity whose ancestry traces back to any of various waves of immigrants originating from one or more of the twenty-three countries comprised by the Arab world. History People from the Arab Middle East have been migrating in numbers to New Zealand since the 1900s beginning with those from Lebanon. In 1936 there were 1,261 people of Lebanese origin in New Zealand; it has been estimated that in the early 1980s the descendants of Lebanese totalled 5,000. Many assimilated and moved to other parts of the country. In the 1890s there was a move to introduce legislation that would stop Lebanese migration and ban those already resident from peddling goods. This proved successful and few migrants arrived from Lebanon as a result. Today Recently Iraqis in New Zealand have replaced Lebanese, of which there are approximately 1,000 as the most common Arab Middle Eastern migrant group with more than 6,500 settling mostly in the main centres. Statistics show that nearly 15,000 Middle Eastern immigrants (including those of Persian origin) moved to New Zealand since 1997. However, New Zealanders with an ethnic Arab Middle Eastern background are likely to be greater in number, since many migrants have had children in New Zealand. Many of these migrants have entered under the humanitarian category when seeking residence in New Zealand. Religion The Lebanese brought with them different Christian and Muslim faiths. The three main Christian followings are Maronites, Eastern Orthodox and Melkites (Greek Catholics). The three main Muslim followings are Shia, Sunni and Druze. Many of the other Arab Middle Eastern people however follow mainly Islam, and it is thought that more than half of all migrants from the Arab Middle East are Muslim.

Initially they were a Boston Bruins farm team. The first coach was Harry Sinden, and NHL stars Bernie Parent, Gerry Cheevers, Doug Favell, Reggie Leach, Rick MacLeish, Wayne Cashman, Ivan Boldirev, J. P. Parise, Ross Lonsberry, Dallas Smith, Bill Goldsworthy and Jean Pronovost played for the Blazers. The Bruins withdrew from the team in 1972, but after a season without hockey, Maple Leaf Gardens Limited announced that they would relocate their Tulsa Oilers club of the CHL to become the reborn Oklahoma City Blazers, with Tulsa getting a replacement independent team. From 1973 to 1976 the team was affiliated with the Toronto Maple Leafs and their roster included Mike Palmateer, Blaine Stoughton, Pat Boutette and all-time NHL penalty leader Dave \\"Tiger\\" Williams. Prior to the 1976-77 season the Maple Leafs decided to share the Dallas Black Hawks of the CHL with the Chicago Black Hawks as their affiliate, in an attempt to reduce costs. Gregg Sheppard was the franchise's leading career scorer. Their home arenas were the Fairgrounds Arena and the Myriad Convention Center Arena. The Blazers won the CHL championship in 1966 under player-coach Harry Sinden and repeated in 1967. John Brooks, sports director of the local CBS TV affiliate KWTV Channel 9 and radio play-by-play voice for high-profile University of Oklahoma football and men's basketball from 1978 to 1992, was the on-air voice of the original Blazers in the 1960s and 1970s.

The answer came in the adoption of a structural system based on using precast concrete hyperbolic paraboloids, 14ft-5in square (from basic motel unit width-requirement, plus necessary overlap) in two heights arranged in a U-shaped plan (the remaining wing will be added shortly).

In an unusual arrangement, dispatchers for both railways used the same office in the station. The depot served both passenger and freight trains; the freight trains exported the town's agricultural products, which included livestock, poultry, dairy, and cotton. In addition, the depot functioned as a social center for the town and was the site of numerous business transactions. The depot closed in 1955 when passenger service on the line ended. After the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad threatened to demolish the station, the village bought the building in 1982. The village restored the depot using donations from local residents, and after completing the restoration in 1986, the Village Hall was moved to the depot. The depot was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 6, 1986.

Due to the rise of the ground level the macellum is now located beneath the church of San Lorenzo Maggiore. The first construction dates to 5th or 4th century BC when the area was the location of the agora during the Greek period. When Neapolis became a Roman possession it was eventually transformed into a macellum. This structure was covered by a mudslide in the 5th century AD, probably as a result of flooding. An early Christian basilica was constructed over the remains of the covered macellum. Consequently, this basilica was replaced by new construction over the centuries. As a result, the mud slide preserved the remains of the macellum. The macellum had an entrance to the north, where the Via dei Tribunali runs now. The rectangular building consists of a porticoed area with workshops and an internal open courtyard with mosaic floors. In the middle of the courtyard was a tholos, a circular building used for food selling. Small tabernae, a laundry and the treasury can still be recognized. Today the macellum can be visited as a part of the monumental complex of San Lorenzo Maggiore.

The Scotland semi-professional team competed in the Four Nations Tournament and was organised by the Scottish Football Association (SFA). The team was disbanded in 2008, when the SFA board decided to stop providing the finance needed for the team to operate. At the time the team was disbanded, players in the three senior non-leagues, the East of Scotland Football League, Highland Football League and South of Scotland Football League, were eligible for selection. History The semi-pro team was first formed in the late 1970s. The first incarnation of the team was originally made of players from Scottish Football League clubs outside the Premier Division. The most recent incarnation of the team (1990s and 2000s) was made of players selected from the two of the three former senior non leagues in Scotland; the Highland League and the East of Scotland League. The third senior non league was the South of Scotland League, which had not had a select side for long time, hampering scouting and selection, which coupled with friction over travel issues effectively saw what few players of calibre they had excluded.Scotland Semi-Pro Internationals scottishleague.net. 25-04-2009. Retrieved 20-10-2013.Since 2013-14 season there are only two senior non- leagues the Highland League and Lowland League (was a merger of East of Scotland and South of Scotland Leagues.) The semi-pro team regularly played friendlies against a Highland League Select. They also regularly played preparation games against Scottish Football League clubs prior to international tournaments in the 1980s. The team was disbanded by the Scottish FA in November 2008. The Scottish FA decided to withdraw funding for the semi- professional side in order to save money, more than ¬£20,000 worth of funding was pulled. = Four Nations Tournament = There was no officially sanctioned competition by either UEFA or FIFA for national teams at non-league level, but Scotland competed in the annual Four Nations Semi-Pro Tournament between 1979 and 2008. The competition was abandoned from 1988 to 2001, while no competition took place in 1986. The first eight editions of the tournament (1979‚Äì1987) saw Scotland compete against England Semi-Pro, Netherlands Amateurs and Italy Serie C U-21s. The later reinstatement of the competition saw the semi-pro teams of Scotland, England, Wales and Republic of Ireland compete from 2002 to 2008. The Gibraltar national team replaced Ireland in the last edition. Scotland last hosted the Four Nations Tournament in 2007, when matches were played in Dingwall, Inverness and Brora.

Written while he served the church in California, it replaced the militaristic imagery of Onward Christian Soldiers with a broader evocation of spiritual mission and unity. It is included in the United Methodist Hymnal as #555. Biography Frederick Hosmer, was born in Framingham, Massachusetts, on October 16, 1840, the son of Charles and Susan Hosmer. He graduated from Harvard College in 1862 and from the Harvard Divinity School in 1869. He became a friend of William Gannett when both were students at the Divinity School. In his earlier years he was known as a beloved pastor and an acceptable preacher, his most successful pastorate being that in Cleveland, where he built up a strong and influential church. On October 26, 1869, he was ordained minister of the First Congregational Church (Unitarian) of Northborough, Massachusetts, where he remained for three years. From October 1872 until April 1877, he served as the Minister at the Quincy Unitarian Church in Quincy, IL. He was active not only as an organizer and director of the activities of young people but as a power in liberalizing the thought of the Quincy, IL community. Thereafter he was minister of the First Unitarian Church of Cleveland, Ohio, 1878‚Äì1892. He went on to be the minister of The Church of the Unity in Saint Louis, Missouri from September 1894 to September 1899;Swisher, Walter Samuel, \\"A History of the Church of the Messiah: 1934‚Äì1934\\", First Unitarian Church press, Saint Louis, 1934. and of the First Unitarian Church of Berkeley, California, 1900‚Äì15, where he was named minister emeritus until his death on June 7, 1929. It was not until he approached middle life that he began to write hymns. In 1880 Hosmer, Gannett and James Vila Blake compiled and edited Unity Hymns and Chorals for the Congregation and the Home, a hymnbook which had a considerable circulation in its day and of which a revised edition was brought out in 1911. In 1886 Hosmer and Gannett published The Thought of God in Hymns and Poems, a book which contained fifty‚Äìsix pieces by Hosmer. The English hymnologist Percy Dearmer described Hosmer‚Äôs hymn, ‚ÄúO Thou in all thy might so far,‚Äù as ‚Äúthis flawless poem, one of the completest expressions of religious faith.‚Äù About Hosmer‚Äôs hymn ‚ÄúThy kingdom come‚Äîon bended knee/ The passing ages pray,‚Äù (written for the 1891 Commencement of the Meadville Theological School), Dearmer wrote, ‚Äúone of the noblest hymns in the language.‚Äù Hosmer often wrote hymns for special occasions, the most notable instance being his great hymn ‚ÄúO prophet souls of all the years,‚Äù written for the Parliament of Religions held in Chicago in 1893, to capture the vision and spirit of that watershed meeting.James, Jacqui ed., \\"Between the Lines:Sources for 'Singing the Living Tradition', Skinner House Books, Boston, 1995, 1998, p. 69 It has been said of Frederick Hosmer that he \\"...was a man of highest ethical standards and keen religious insight.

It is conducted in a \\"town hall debate\\" style with the presenter, Siki Mgabadeli, interviewing key guests, asking questions, and moderating the subsequent debate. It began running in 2009 and was devised by filmmaker Ben Cashdan. The show is produced by Broad Daylight Films Foundation, a non-profit production company, based in Johannesburg.  Broadcast  As of 2014, THE BIG DEBATE is broadcast on eNCA in South Africa every Tuesday at 9pm. eNCA is to be found on the Multichoice/DSTV satellite platform in South and Southern Africa on Channel 403. It also airs on the free to air channel e.tv every Sunday at 10am. The SABC announced that it would be shown on SABC 2 from 2018 on wards. As of 2021, The Big Debate will air on eIndia.  Controversy  In October 2013, the South African Broadcasting Corporation pulled the show off the air just a few hours before the broadcast of an episode on Workers Rights, citing 'editorial oversight' as the reason for the show's axing. The cancelled show dealt in some detail with the killing of 34 mineworkers at Marikana by the South African police. Campaign groups, including the Right2Know Campaign in South Africa and the Freedom of Expression Institute described the cancellation of the show by the SABC as censorship, accusing the national broadcaster of pulling the show to prevent government critics from appearing on television. Various commentators and media freedom groups described the SABC's explanation for pulling the show as far fetched, noting the irony that a TV series promoting open debate was cancelled on press freedom day. It was subsequently reported in the national press that the South African National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) had pressured the SABC to cancel the series just hours before the airing of the episode on Workers Rights, as this episode was to reveal that the NUM was losing support to rival trade unions (although the SABC refuted that they came under outside pressure). Shortly after the show was canned by the SABC, it started to air on South Africa's independent 24-hour news channel, eNCA. Since moving to a new broadcaster, ten episodes have aired. After a recent episode where young South Africans were invited to put questions to leaders of political parties, one critic writing in an Afrikaans newspaper described the show as \\"Too much of a shouting match\\".

This problem was thought to be serious enough to warrant intervention by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to label greater likelihood of suicide as a risk of using antidepressants. Some studies have shown that the use of certain antidepressants correlate with an increased risk of suicide in some patients relative to other antidepressants. However, these conclusions have faced considerable scrutiny and disagreement: A multinational European study indicated that antidepressants decrease risk of suicide at the population level, and other reviews of antidepressant use claim that there is not enough data to indicate antidepressant use increases risk of suicide. Youth People under the age of 25 with depression antidepressants could increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. In 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration along with the Neuro-Psychopharmacologic Advisory Committee and the Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee, concluded that there was a causal link between newer antidepressants and pediatric suicidality. Federal health officials unveiled proposed changes to the labels on antidepressant drugs in December 2006 to warn people of this danger. A 2016 review of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) which looked at four outcomes‚Äîdeath, suicidality, aggressive behaviour, and agitation‚Äîfound that while the data was insufficient to draw strong conclusions, adults taking these drugs did not appear to be at increased risk for any of the four outcomes, but that for children, the risks of suicidality and for aggression doubled. The authors expressed frustration with incomplete reporting and lack of access to data, and with some aspects of the clinical trial designs. Boxed warning for desvenlafaxine, an SNRI Warnings The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires \\"black box warnings\\" on all SSRIs, which state that they double suicidal ideation rates (from 2 in 1,000 to 4 in 1,000) in children and adolescents. It remains controversial whether increased risk of suicide is due to the medication (a paradoxical effect) or part of the depression itself (i.e. the antidepressant enables those who are severely depressed‚Äîwho ordinarily would be paralyzed by their depression‚Äîto become more alert and act out suicidal urges before being fully recovered from their depressive episode). The increased risk for suicidality and suicidal behaviour among adults under 25 approaches that seen in children and adolescents. Young patients should be closely monitored for signs of suicidal ideation or behaviors, especially in the first eight weeks of therapy. Sertraline, tricyclic agents and venlafaxine were found to increase the risk of attempted suicide in severely depressed adolescents on Medicaid. Increased risk for quitting medication A 2009 study showed increased risk of suicide after initiation, titration, and discontinuation of medication. A study of 159,810 users of either amitriptyline, fluoxetine, paroxetine or dothiepin found that the risk of suicidal behavior is increased in the first month after starting antidepressants, especially during the first 1 to 9 days. Prevalence On September 6, 2007, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the suicide rate in American adolescents, (especially girls, 10 to 24 years old), increased 8% (2003 to 2004), the largest jump in 15 years, to 4,599 suicides in Americans ages 10 to 24 in 2004, from 4,232 in 2003, giving a suicide rate of 7.32 per 100,000 people that age. The rate previously dropped to 6.78 per 100,000 in 2003 from 9.48 per 100,000 in 1990. Jon Jureidini, a critic of this study, says that the US \\"2004 suicide figures were compared simplistically with the previous year, rather than examining the change in trends over several years\\". It has been noted that the pitfalls of such attempts to infer a trend using just two data points (years 2003 and 2004) are further demonstrated by the fact that, according to the new epidemiological data, the suicide rate in 2005 in children and adolescents actually declined despite the continuing decrease of SSRI prescriptions. \\"It is risky to draw conclusions from limited ecologic analyses of isolated year-to-year fluctuations in antidepressant prescriptions and suicides. One promising epidemiological approach involves examining the associations between trends in psychotropic medication use and suicide over time across a large number of small geographic regions. Until the results of more detailed analyses are known, prudence dictates deferring judgment concerning the public health effects of the FDA warnings.\\" Subsequest follow- up studies have supported the hypothesis that antidepressant drugs reduce suicide risk. Suicide risk In those under the age of 25 antidepressants appear to increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In the United States they contain a black box warning regarding this concern.

Husayn is therefore often known in later histories as the \\"Man of Fakhkh\\" (). Husayn and his supporters planned an uprising at Medina during the annual pilgrimage of 786, but their hand was forced by a confrontation with the local governor, al-Umari. The conspirators rose in revolt on the morning of 16 May, and seized the Mosque of the Prophet, where Husayn's supporters swore allegiance to him. The revolt failed to gather support among the populace, and the reaction of the Abbasid garrison prevented the rebels from establishing control over the city, and eventually confined them to the Mosque itself. After eleven days, the Alids and their supporters, some 300 strong, abandoned Medina and headed to Mecca. Informed of these events, the Abbasid caliph al-Hadi appointed his uncle Muhammad ibn Sulayman ibn Ali to deal with the rebels, with an army composed chiefly of the armed retinues of the various Abbasid princes who on that year had gone to the pilgrimage. In the ensuing battle, at the wadi of Fakhkh near Mecca, Husayn and over a hundred of his followers were killed, many others were captured, and some escaped by passing themselves off as pilgrims, including the future founder of the Idrisid dynasty in what is now Morocco. The uprising had a strong social character, with Husayn drawing inspiration from Zayd ibn Ali's 740 revolt, and itself impacted later Zaydi Shi'a practices. Background In 748‚Äì750, the Abbasid Revolution overthrew the Umayyad Caliphate (661‚Äì750) and established the Abbasid dynasty at the helm of the Islamic world. The change of dynasty was not a mere succession struggle, but the culmination of a broad social and political movement that rejected the Umayyad regime, which was widely regarded as oppressive, too dependent on and favouring its Syrian heartland to the exclusion of other areas, and more concerned with the worldly aspects of the caliphate than the teachings of Islam. A widespread belief at the time favoured replacing Umayyad dynastic rule with that of a \\"chosen one from the Family of Muhammad\\" (), who alone would have the divine guidance necessary to interpret the Quran and create a truly Islamic government that would bring justice to the Muslim community, treating all Muslims equally regardless of their origin. In the first instance this meant the Alids, i.e., those claiming descent from Muhammad via Ali ibn Abi Talib. However, the Abbasids exploited the vagueness of the slogan by portraying themselves as also being members of the wider \\"Family of the Prophet\\" through their common descent from the Banu Hashim clan. This claim was rejected by later Shi'a writers, who restricted membership in the Family of the Prophet to the Alids and thus considered the Abbasids as usurpers, but this distinction was not so clear-cut at the time, and the Abbasid claims appear to have been widely accepted when they came to power. As a result, the relationship between the Abbasid dynasty and the Alids was ambivalent and underwent many changes. The Abbasids tried to secure Alid support, or at least acquiescence, to their rule through the award of salaries and honours at court. Nevertheless, many Alids, chiefly of the Zaydi and Hasanid branches, continued to reject the Abbasids as usurpers, and several went into hiding and once again tried to rouse the discontented against the new regime. The second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur (), imprisoned several Alids, and had to face a major Alid revolt in Medina and Basra, headed by Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya, in 762‚Äì763. A close relative of Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya was al-Husayn ibn Ali. His father Ali was Muhammad's first cousin, and his mother Zaynab was Muhammad's aunt. Husayn thus grew up in what the historian Laura Veccia Vaglieri describes as \\"an atmosphere of extreme piety and of secret hatred for the Abbasids\\". Nevertheless, Husayn had friendly relations with the third Abbasid caliph, al-Mahdi (), who gave him money and released an Alid prisoner at Husayn's intercession. Outbreak of the revolt Silver dirham of al-Hadi Shortly after al-Mahdi died in July 785, Husayn and his followers rose in revolt at Medina, hoping to take advantage of the as yet unstable position of al-Mahdi's successor, al-Hadi. The early 10th-century historian al-Tabari records several traditions that suggest that the immediate cause of the revolt was a quarrel between Husayn and the Abbasid governor of Medina, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Abdallah, known as al-Umari. Al-Umari tried to regulate the Alids' movements in the city, and had three men, including Abu'l-Zift, a son of Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya, flogged and publicly humiliated for flouting the Islamic prohibition against the consumption of alcohol; this caused outrage among the Alids. The situation grew worse when it was discovered that Abu'l-Zift, for whom Husayn and Yahya ibn Abdallah (a half-brother of Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya) had vouched, had fled the city. In the ensuing confrontation with al-Umari, Yahya and the governor exchanged insults and threats, making the situation untenable for Husayn and his followers. While this may have been the immediate spark for the uprising, from the subsequent passages of al-Tabari it is evident that an uprising had been planned for some time, including the recruitment of Kufans who were secretly lying in wait in the city, and the hope of assistance by sympathizers who performed the pilgrimage. The motivation for the revolt is unclear; later Shi'a writers claim that it resulted from the anti-Alid stance of the new caliph, al-Hadi, but there are indications that in his final years al-Mahdi himself had turned from a conciliatory policy to hostility towards the Alids, causing great discontent among the Shi'a. Having quarreled with the governor, the conspirators decided to move on the next morning (probably 16 May). Yahya ibn Abdallah went to arrest al-Umari at his residence, but the latter had already gone into hiding. About 26 Alids and some of their supporters gathered at the Mosque of the Prophet, where Husayn took the pulpit dressed in white and wearing a white turban. The rebels reportedly forced the muezzin to pronounce the call to the morning prayer in the Shi'a wording, which was what warned al- Umari that something was afoot. Most people turned away when they saw Husayn in the pulpit, but his followers started arriving and swearing allegiance to him as caliph and imam and as , \\"the One pleasing to God from the house of Muhammad\\". The appellation was evidently adopted as Husayn's honorific title in the fashion of the caliphs. Whether out of the rivalry between the Hasanid and Husaynid branches, or because they thought that the uprising was doomed to failure, two of the Alids refused their support. One of them, Musa ibn Ja'far al-Kadhim, who is considered as the seventh imam by the Twelver Shi'a, reportedly warned Husayn that his actions would only result in his death. The assembled rebels were confronted by about 200 Abbasid troops from the local garrison, with al-Umari and a certain Khalid al-Barbari at their head. Khalid charged forward, aiming to kill Husayn, but was cut down by Idris ibn Abdallah and Yahya ibn Abdallah, brothers of Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya; taking heart, the rebels attacked the Abbasid troops, who fled. With the Abbasid partisans repelled, Husayn addressed his followers, concluding his speech with a declaration and oath: The revolt failed to find many adherents; according to al-Tabari, \\"the people of Medina locked their doors\\". Next morning, the fighting between the partisans of the Alids (, the \\"wearers of white\\") and the Abbasids (, the \\"wearers of black\\") spread throughout the city, with the Abbasids driving the Alids back. Fresh Abbasid troops under Mubarak al-Turki arrived next day, heartening the Abbasid partisans. After another day of fierce fighting, interrupted only during the hot noon hours, the Alids were confined to the area of mosque, while the Abbasids used the nearby governor's residence as their base. The confrontation lasted for eleven days, during which the Alids, with their failure to secure the city evident, gathered supplies for travel. With about 300 followers, Husayn left the city on 28 May 786. In their wake, they left the mosque in a state of filth, defiled with the bones of the animals the beleaguered Alids had been eating, and its curtains cut up to make kaftans, leading to general indignation among the Medinese. Confrontation at Fakhkh With his 300 men, Husayn made for Mecca. On the way, he was joined by sympathizers from that city. In the meantime, al-Hadi assembled an armed response to Husayn's revolt. Several Abbasid princes were at that time returning from their pilgrimage to Mecca, and one of them, Muhammad ibn Sulayman ibn Ali (first cousin of al-Mansur), had taken along a strong escort to protect his caravan from Bedouin attacks. Al-Hadi appointed Muhammad to deal with the rebels; he turned back to Mecca, where he was joined by the armed retinues of all of the Abbasid elites who had been in the city: the sources refer to 130 men mounted on horses and some mules, 200 on donkeys, and unspecified numbers of infantry. After a parade through the city that was probably designed to intimidate any pro-Alid sympathizers, the Abbasid army encamped at Dhu Tuwa at the edge of the city. As the Alids and their supporters drew near, the two armies confronted one another on 11 June, at the wadi of Fakhkh, some northwest of Mecca. The Abbasid force was led by the princes al-Abbas ibn Muhammad and Musa ibn Isa on the left, Muhammad ibn Sulayman on the right, and the Khurasani commander Mu'adh ibn Muslim in the centre. The battle began at dawn, and the Alid forces focused on the Abbasids' left wing. When Muhammad ibn Sulayman was victorious on his wing, he led the Abbasid right and centre against the bulk of the Alid army, which had been \\"massed together as if they were a compact ball of spun thread\\", in the words of al-Tabari, resulting in a rout of the Alids. During the battle, the Abbasids offered clemency (), but Husayn refused it, fighting on until he was killed. His severed head was taken to al-Hadi, who sent it on to Khurasan as a warning to the local Shi'a. Over a hundred of his followers fell, and were left unburied at the battlefield for three days; but others availed themselves of the to surrender. Abu'l-Zift was one of them, surrendering to his uncle, Muhammad ibn Sulayman; but he was killed by Ubayd Allah ibn al-Abbas at the urging of his father, al-Abbas ibn Muhammad, and Musa ibn Isa, leading to a fierce quarrel between the Abbasid princes. Of the Alids taken prisoner, a brother (Sulayman) and a son (al-Hasan) of Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya were executed at Mecca, while al-Hadi executed at least three other Alid prisoners at Baghdad. Many Alids managed to escape the battle by mingling with the pilgrims. Among them were Idris and Yahya, the brothers of Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya. Idris eventually moved to the Maghreb, and in 789 established the Idrisid dynasty in the area of modern Morocco, while his brother Yahya raised a revolt in Daylam in 792. At the news of the Alids' defeat, al-Umari burned the houses of the Alids and their supporters and confiscated their properties. Impact Shi'a sources proclaim that Husayn's uprising had a \\"Zaydi\\" character, i.e., a social dimension which distinguishes it from the mostly \\"legitimist\\" revolt of Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya. The formula of the oath of allegiance sworn to Husayn was similar to that of Zayd ibn Ali in 740, including promises to defend the oppressed and redress injustices. The historian Laura Veccia Vaglieri points out that in Husayn's formula, \\"the duty of the subjects to obey him depended on his keeping the promises which he had made\\", something emulated a century later by al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya, when he founded a Zaydi state in Yemen. During his brief residence in Medina, he also promised liberty to the slaves who joined him, but faced with protests by their masters that this was an unlawful act, he had to return some of them. The wadi of Fakhkh was thereafter known as (\\"the Martyrs\\"), and assumed a prominent position in Shi'a martyrology, since in the number of fallen Alids, it was second only to the Battle of Karbala. The revolt's failure exemplified the weakness of the Alids' position, and also the relative success of al- Mahdi's policies in reducing the danger they posed to the regime. In its aftermath, many Alids dispersed from the Hejaz to the periphery of the Islamic world, in areas such as the Maghreb and northern Iran, with far-reaching repercussions, as they brought Alid loyalties to these regions.

Byfleet Manor has been used as a filming location in three television series, most notably Downton Abbey. History Byfleet Manor's precursor was a royal hunting lodge given by Edward II to Piers Gaveston, his reputed lover. Anne of Denmark, wife of King James I, the house's last royal owner, commissioned a fresh house here in 1619. However, she died before it was finished. The front walls and gate piers, which can still be seen today, date from that time. A detailed ownership and account of royal rights is set out in sources covering this period of history, such as the Feet of Fines and the Assize Rolls kept in the royal collections and The National Archives, but which is well summarised in, for example, the Victoria County History. A rebuilding followed in 1685 as the early Jacobean architecture house was reported to be ruinous. This change led to a much smaller building. In 1672 the lands were granted to Lord Holles and others to hold in trust for Queen Catherine of Braganza for her life, and afterwards for Charles II of England and his heirs. In 1694 Sir John Buckworth, lord of the manor of Byfleet, was accused of neglect in repairing a bridge over the Wey. It was found, however, that he was not responsible for such repair, as he was only a \\"termer for years\\" in the manor under a \\"lease made by the late queen mother's trustees.\\" There is very little trace of the manor for about a century after this. An Enclosure Award, privatising fields, was made in 1811 for in the parish, including common fields of Byfleet Manor, i.e. formerly whose profits were shared between its owner, tenants and subtenants. The house remained virtually unaltered until 1905, when it was restored and enlarged with the addition of asymmetrical wings. The scant modern vestiges of the ancient manorial rights were sold to a firm of solicitors in that decade. In February 2013, a hidden room was found within the home. The owners have allowed the patios and front rooms to be hired to host 1920s-themed tea parties. Filming location It has served as the dower house in ITV's Downton Abbey, as well as in the television adaptation of Agatha Christie's Poirot: After the Funeral and in the BBC television series Cranford.

Mortimer Wilson, MA, whose name went on to be borne by the school for close on 70 years. The school opened as a non- selective establishment with two separate schools within, the boys and girls being educated separately. The first headmaster of the boys' school was Wilfred Dawes and the headmistress of the girls' school was Miss Cresswell. After the Second World War four houses were introduced named Brindley, Nightingale, Royce and Stephenson. The school became a comprehensive in the late 1960s. Miss Cresswell then retired and Mr Dawes took full control of the school. During his time as headmaster the school was recognised as a modal for the comprehensive system. In recognition of his achievements, Wilfred Dawes was appointed O.B.E. for his services to Education. He was a strong Socialist and supporter of the comprehensive system. The school gained specialist Arts College status in 2008 and was renamed Alfreton Grange Arts College. On 22, July 2013, the headteacher, Gail Giles was suspended pending investigation from the governing body. Then two months later in September 2013 the school was deemed inadequate by Ofsted and the school was placed into special measures. Previously a community school administered by Derbyshire County Council, in September 2016 Alfreton Grange Arts College converted to academy status and renamed David Nieper Academy. In preparation for the conversion, In April 2016, Kathryn Hobbs was named the new Headteacher of the school. The name of the school has changed many times over the years.

In healthy individuals, central fatigue can occur from prolonged exercise and is associated with neurochemical changes in the brain, primarily involving serotonin (5-HT), noradrenaline, and dopamine. Central fatigue plays an important role in endurance sports and also highlights the importance of proper nutrition in endurance athletes. Neurochemical mechanisms Existing experimental methods have provided enough evidence to suggest that variations in synaptic serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine are significant drivers of central nervous system fatigue. An increased synaptic dopamine concentration in the CNS is strongly ergogenic (promotes exercise performance). An increased synaptic serotonin or noradrenaline concentration in the CNS impairs exercise performance. =Noradrenaline= Manipulation of norepinephrine suggests it may actually play a role in creating a feeling of fatigue. Reboxetine, an NRI inhibitor, decreased time to fatigue and increased subjective feelings of fatigue. This may be explained by a paradoxical decrease in adrenergic activity lead by feedback mechanisms. =Serotonin= In the brain, serotonin is a neurotransmitter and regulates arousal, behavior, sleep, and mood, among other things.Young, S. N. The clinical psychopharmacology of tryptophan. In: Nutrition and the Brain. Vol. 7, R. J. Wurtman and J. J. Wurtman, (Eds.). New York: Raven, 1986, pp. 49‚Äì88 During prolonged exercise where central nervous system fatigue is present, serotonin levels in the brain are higher than normal physiological conditions; these higher levels can increase perceptions of effort and peripheral muscle fatigue. The increased synthesis of brain serotonin occurs because of a higher level of tryptophan, the serotonin precursor, in the blood and which results in larger amounts of tryptophan crossing the blood-brain barrier. An important factor of serotonin synthesis is the transport mechanism of tryptophan across the blood-brain barrier. The transport mechanism for tryptophan is shared with the branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), leucine, isoleucine, and valine. During extended exercise, BCAAs are consumed for skeletal muscle contraction, allowing for greater transport of tryptophan across the blood-brain barrier. None of the components of the serotonin synthesis reaction are saturated under normal physiological conditions,Newsholme, E. A., I. N. Acworth, and E. Bloomstrand. Amino acids, brain neurotransmitters and a functional link between muscle and brain that is important in sustained exercise. In: Advances in Myochemistry, G. Benzi (Ed.). London: John Libbey Eurotext Ltd., 1987 allowing for the increased production of the neurotransmitter. However the failure of BCAAs to decrease time to fatigue consistently limit this hypothesis. =Dopamine= Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that regulates arousal, motivation, muscular coordination, and endurance performance, among other things.Chaouloff, F., D. Laude, and J. L. Elghozi. Physical exercise: evidence for differential consequences of tryptophan on 5-HT synthesis and metabolism in central serotonergic cell bodies and terminals.J. Neural Transm. 78:121‚Äì130, 1989. Dopamine levels have been found to be lower after prolonged exercise.Bailey, S. P., J. M. Davis and E. N. Ahlborn. Neuroendocrine and substrate responses to altered brain 5-HT activity during prolonged exercise to fatigue. J. Appl. Physiol. 74:3006‚Äì3012, 1993 A decrease in dopamine can decrease athletic performance as well as mental motivation. Dopamine itself cannot cross the blood brain barrier and must be synthesized within the brain. In rats bred for running, increased activity of the ventral tegmental area have been observed, and VTA activity correlates with voluntary wheel running. As the VTA is an area dense in dopaminergic neurons that project to many areas of the brain, this suggests that dopaminergic neurotransmission drives physical performance. Further supporting this theory is the fact that dopamine reuptake inhibitors as well as norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitors are able to increase exercise performance, especially in the heat. =Acetylcholine= Acetylcholine is required for the generation of muscular force. In the central nervous system, acetylcholine modulates arousal and temperature regulation. It also may play a role in central fatigue. During exercise, levels of acetylcholine drop.Conlay, L. A., Sabournjian, L. A., and Wurtman, R. J. Exercise and neuromodulators: choline and acetylcholine in marathon runners.Int. J. Sports Med. 13(Suppl. 1):S141-142, 1992 This is due to a decrease in plasma choline levels. However, there have been conflicting results in studies about the effect of acetylcholine on fatigue. One study found that plasma choline levels had dropped 40% after the subjects ran the Boston Marathon. Another study found that choline supplementation did not improve time to exhaustion.Spector, S. A., M. R. Jackman, L. A. Sabounjian, C. Sakkas, D. M. Landers, and W. T. Willis. Effects of choline supplementation on fatigue in trained cyclists. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. 27:668‚Äì673, 1995 This study also found that plasma choline levels had not changed in either the placebo or the choline supplemented groups. More research is needed to investigate acetylcholine's effects on fatigue. =Cytokines= Cytokines can manipulate neurotransmissions creating sickness behavior, characterized by malaise and fatigue. In animal models, IL-1b stimulates serotonin release and increases activity of GABA. Lipopolysaccharide challenges also inhibit activity of histaminergic and dopaminergic neurons. =Ammonia= Increased circulating levels of ammonia may alter brain function and result in fatigue. One hypothesized reason that BCAAs fail to increase exercise performance is due to increased oxidation of BCAAs in supplementation that results in increased fatigue, canceling out the effects on 5-HT. Manipulation Controlling central nervous system fatigue can help scientists develop a deeper understanding of fatigue as a whole. Numerous approaches have been taken to manipulate neurochemical levels and behavior. In sports, nutrition plays a large role in athletic performance. In addition to fuel, many athletes consume performance-enhancing drugs including stimulants in order to boost their abilities. =Dopamine reuptake and release agents= Amphetamine is a stimulant that has been found to improve both physical and cognitive performance. Amphetamine blocks the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, which delays the onset of fatigue by increasing the amount of dopamine, despite the concurrent increase in norepinephrine, in the central nervous system. Amphetamine is a widely used substance among collegiate athletes for its performance enhancing qualities,Bracken NM (January 2012). \\"National Study of Substance Use Trends Among NCAA College Student-Athletes\\". NCAA Publications. National Collegiate Athletic Association. Retrieved 8 October 2013. as it can improve muscle strength, reaction time, acceleration, anaerobic exercise performance, power output at fixed levels of perceived exertion, and endurance. Methylphenidate has also been shown to increase exercise performance in time to fatigue and time trial studies. =Caffeine= Caffeine is the most widely consumed stimulant in North America. Caffeine causes the release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla. In small doses, caffeine can improve endurance. Recently, it has also been shown to delay the onset of fatigue in exercise. The most probable mechanism for the delay of fatigue is through the obstruction of adenosine receptors in the central nervous system.Central nervous system effects of caffeine and adenosine on fatigue. J. Mark Davis, Zuowei Zhao, Howard S. Stock, Kristen A. Mehl, James Buggy, Gregory A. Hand. American Journal of Physiology. Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology Published 1 February 2003 Vol. 284 no. R399-R404DOI: 10.1152/ajpregu.00386.2002 Adenosine is a neurotransmitter that decreases arousal and increases sleepiness. By preventing adenosine from acting, caffeine removes a factor that promotes rest and delays fatigue. =Carbohydrates= Carbohydrates are the main source of energy in organisms for metabolism. They are an important source of fuel in exercise. A study conducted by the Institute of Food, Nutrition, and Human Health at Massey University investigated the effect of consuming a carbohydrate and electrolyte solution on muscle glycogen use and running capacity on subjects that were on a high carbohydrate diet. The group that consumed the carbohydrate and electrolyte solution before and during exercise experienced greater endurance capacity. This could not be explained by the varying levels of muscle glycogen; however, higher plasma glucose concentration may have led to this result. Dr. Stephen Bailey posits that the central nervous system can sense the influx of carbohydrates and reduces the perceived effort of the exercise, allowing for greater endurance capacity. =Branched-chain amino acids= Several studies have attempted to decrease the synthesis of serotonin by administering branched-chain amino acids and inhibiting the transport of tryptophan across the blood brain barrier.Meeusen, R., & Watson, P. (2007). Amino acids and the brain: do they play a role in \\"central fatigue\\"? Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab, 17 Suppl, S37-46 The studies performed resulted in little or no change in performance between increased BCAA intake and placebo groups. One study in particular administered a carbohydrate solution and a carbohydrate + BCAA solution.Blomstrand, E., S. Andersson, P. Hassmen, B. Ekblom, and E. A. Newsholme. Effect of branched-chain amino acid and carbohydrate supplementation on the exercise-induced change in plasma and muscle concentration of amino acids in human subjects. Acta Phys. Scand. 153:87‚Äì96, 1995 Both of the groups were able to run for longer before fatigue compared to the water placebo group. However, both the carbohydrate and the carbohydrate + BCAA groups had no differences in their performance. Branch- chained amino acid supplementation has proven to have little to no effect on performance. There has been little success utilizing neurotransmitter precursors to control central nervous system fatigue. One review hypothesized that the inconsistency with BCAA administration was the result of ammonia accumulation as a result of increased BCAA oxidation. Role Central nervous system fatigue is a key component in preventing peripheral muscle injury.Fatigue is a Brain-Derived Emotion that Regulates the Exercise Behavior to Ensure the Protection of Whole Body Homeostasis. Timothy David Noakes. Front Physiol. 2012; 3: 82. Prepublished online 2012 January 9. Published online 2012 April 11. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2012.00082. The brain has numerous receptors, such as osmoreceptors, to track dehydration, nutrition, and body temperature. With that information as well as peripheral muscle fatigue information, the brain can reduce the quantity of motor commands sent from the central nervous system. This is crucial in order to protect the homeostasis of the body and to keep it in a proper physiological state capable of full recovery. The reduction of motor commands sent from the brain increases the amount of perceived effort an individual experiences. By forcing the body through a higher perceived intensity, the individual becomes more likely to cease exercise by means of exhaustion. Perceived effort is greatly influenced by the intensity of corollary discharge from the motor cortex that affects the primary somatosensory cortex.Enoka, R. M. and D.G. Stuart. Neurobiology of muscle fatigue. J. Appl. Physiol. 72:1631‚Äì1648, 1992. Endurance athletes learn to listen to their body. Protecting organs from potentially dangerous core temperatures and nutritional lows is an important brain function. Central nervous system fatigue alerts the athlete when physiological conditions are not optimal so either rest or refueling can occur. It is important to avoid hyperthermia and dehydration, as they are detrimental to athletic performance and can be fatal.Murray R. Dehydration, hyperthermia, and athletes: science and practice. J Athl Train. 1996;31(3):248‚Äì252. Chronic fatigue syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome is a name for a group of diseases that are dominated by persistent fatigue. The fatigue is not due to exercise and is not relieved by rest. Through numerous studies, it has been shown that people with chronic fatigue syndrome have an integral central fatigue component. In one study, the subjects' skeletal muscles were checked to ensure they had no defects that prevented their total use. It was found that the muscles functioned normally on a local level, but they failed to function to their full extent as a whole. The subjects were unable to consistently activate their muscles during sustained use, despite having normal muscle tissue.Kent-Braun, J. A., K. R. Sharma, M. W. Weiner, B. Massie, and R. G. Miller. Central basis of muscle fatigue in chronic fatigue syndrome. Neurology 43:125‚Äì131, 1993 In another study, the subjects experienced higher perceived effort in relation to heart rate as compared to the control during a graded exercise test.Riley, M. S., C. J. O'Brien, D. R. McCluskey, N. P. Bell, and D. P. Nicholls. Aerobic work capacity in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. Br. Med. J. 301:953‚Äì956, 1990 The chronic fatigue subjects would stop before any sort of limit on the body was reached. Both studies proved that peripheral muscle fatigue was not causing the subjects with chronic fatigue syndrome to cease exercising. It is possible that the higher perception of effort required to use the muscles results in great difficulty in accomplishing consistent exercise. The main cause of fatigue in chronic fatigue syndrome most likely lies in the central nervous system. A defect in one of its components could cause a greater requirement of input to result in sustained force. It has been shown that with very high motivation, subjects with chronic fatigue can exert force effectively.Stokes, M. J., R. G. Cooper, and R. H. Edwards. Normal muscle strength and fatigability in patients with effort syndromes. Br. Med. J. 297:1014‚Äì1017, 1988.

It may be initiated in response to a variety of cues, including infection, traumatic brain injury,Ebert SE, Jensen P, Ozenne B, Armand S, Svarer C, Stenbaek DS et al. Molecular imaging of neuroinflammation in patients after mild traumatic brain injury: a longitudinal 123 I-CLINDE SPECT study. Eur J Neurol 2019. doi:10.1111/ene.13971. toxic metabolites, or autoimmunity. In the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain and spinal cord, microglia are the resident innate immune cells that are activated in response to these cues. The CNS is typically an immunologically privileged site because peripheral immune cells are generally blocked by the blood‚Äìbrain barrier (BBB), a specialized structure composed of astrocytes and endothelial cells. However, circulating peripheral immune cells may surpass a compromised BBB and encounter neurons and glial cells expressing major histocompatibility complex molecules, perpetuating the immune response. Although the response is initiated to protect the central nervous system from the infectious agent, the effect may be toxic and widespread inflammation as well as further migration of leukocytes through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier.  Causes  Neuroinflammation is widely regarded as chronic, as opposed to acute, inflammation of the central nervous system. Acute inflammation usually follows injury to the central nervous system immediately, and is characterized by inflammatory molecules, endothelial cell activation, platelet deposition, and tissue edema. Chronic inflammation is the sustained activation of glial cells and recruitment of other immune cells into the brain. It is chronic inflammation that is typically associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Common causes of chronic neuroinflammation include: * Toxic metabolites * Autoimmunity * Aging * Microbes * Viruses * Traumatic brain injury * Spinal cord injury * Air pollution * Passive smoke  Neuroimmune response  = Glial cells = Microglia are recognized as the innate immune cells of the central nervous system. Microglia actively survey their environment through, and change their cell morphology significantly in response to neural injury. Acute inflammation in the brain is typically characterized by rapid activation of microglia. During this period, there is no peripheral immune response. Over time, however, chronic inflammation causes the degradation of tissue and of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. During this time, microglia generate reactive oxygen species and release signals to recruit peripheral immune cells for an inflammatory response. Astrocytes are glial cells that are the most abundant cells in the brain. They are involved in maintenance and support of neurons and compose a significant component of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. After insult to the brain, such as traumatic brain injury, astrocytes may become activated in response to signals released by injured neurons or activated microglia. Once activated, astrocytes may release various growth factors and undergo morphological changes. For example, after injury astrocytes form the glial scar composed of a proteoglycan matrix that hinders axonal regeneration.. However more recent studies revealed that glia scar is not detrimental but benefic for axonal regeneration = Cytokines = Cytokines are a class of proteins that regulates inflammation, cell signaling, and various cell processes such as growth and survival. Chemokines are a subset of cytokines that regulate cell migration, such as attracting immune cells to a site of infection or injury. Various cell types in the brain may produce cytokines and chemokines such as microglia, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and other glial cells. Physiologically, chemokines and cytokines function as neuromodulators that regulate inflammation and development. In the healthy brain, cells secrete cytokines to produce a local inflammatory environment to recruit microglia and clear the infection or injury. However, in neuroinflammation, cells may have sustained release of cytokines and chemokines which may compromise the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Peripheral immune cells are called to the site of injury via these cytokines and may now migrate across the compromised blood brain barrier into the brain. Common cytokines produced in response to brain injury include: interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is produced during astrogliosis, and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Œ≤) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Œ±), which can induce neuronal cytotoxicity. Although the pro-inflammatory cytokines may cause cell death and secondary tissue damage, they are necessary to repair the damaged tissue. For example, TNF-Œ± causes neurotoxicity at early stages of neuroinflammation, but contributes to tissue growth at later stages of inflammation.  Peripheral immune response  The blood‚Äìbrain barrier is a structure composed of endothelial cells and astrocytes that forms a barrier between the brain and circulating blood. Physiologically, this enables the brain to be protected from potentially toxic molecules and cells in the blood. Astrocytes form tight junctions and therefore may strictly regulate what may pass the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and enter the interstitial space. After injury and sustained release of inflammatory factors such as chemokines, the blood‚Äìbrain barrier may be compromised, becoming permeable to circulating blood components and peripheral immune cells. Cells involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses, such as macrophages, T Cells, and B Cells, may then enter into the brain. This exacerbates the inflammatory environment of the brain and contributes to chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.  Traumatic brain injury  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is brain trauma caused by significant force to the head. Following TBI, there are both reparative and degenerative mechanisms that lead to an inflammatory environment. Within minutes of injury, pro-inflammatory cytokines are released. The pro- inflammatory cytokine Il-1Œ≤ is one such cytokine that exacerbates the tissue damage caused by TBI. TBI may cause significant damage to vital components to the brain, including the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Il-1Œ≤ causes DNA fragmentation and apoptosis, and together with TNF-Œ± may cause damage to the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and infiltration of leukocytes. (). Increased density of activated immune cells have been found in the human brain after concussion.  Spinal cord injury  Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) can be divided into three separate phases. The primary or acute phase occurs from seconds to minutes post injury, the secondary phase occurs from minutes to weeks after injury, and the chronic phase occurs from months to years following injury. A primary SCI is caused by spinal cord compression or transection, leading to glutamate excitotoxicity, sodium and calcium ion imbalances, and free radical damage. Neurodegeneration via apoptosis and demyelination of neuronal cells causes inflammation at the injury site. This leads to a secondary SCI, whose symptoms include edema, cavitation of spinal parenchyma, reactive gliosis, and potentially permanent loss of function. During the SCI induced inflammatory response, several pro- inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 1Œ≤ (IL-1Œ≤), inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS), Interferon-Œ≥ (IFN-Œ≥), IL-6, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor Œ± (TNFŒ±) are secreted, activating local microglia and attracting various immune cells such as naive bone-marrow derived macrophages. These activated microglia and macrophages play a role in the pathogenesis of SCI. Upon infiltration of the injury site's epicenter, macrophages will undergo phenotype switching from an M2 phenotype to an M1-like phenotype. The M2 phenotype is associated with anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-10, IL-4, and IL-13 and contributes to wound healing and tissue repair. However, the M1-like phenotype is associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species that contribute to increased damage and inflammation. Factors such as myelin debris, which is formed by the injury at the damage site, has been shown to induce the phenotype shift from M2 to M1. A decreased population of M2 macrophages and an increased population of M1 macrophages is associated with chronic inflammation. Short term inflammation is important in clearing cell debris from the site of injury, but it is this chronic, long-term inflammation that will lead to further cell death and damage radiating from the site of injury. Aging Aging is often associated with cognitive impairment and increased propensity for developing neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Elevated inflammatory markers seemed to accelerate the brain aging process In the aged brain alone, without any evident disease, there are chronically increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines. The homeostatic imbalance between anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines in aging is one factor that increases the risk for neurodegenerative disease. Additionally, there is an increased number of activated microglia in aged brains, which have increased expression of major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II), ionized calcium binding adaptor-1 (IBA1), CD86, ED1 macrophage antigen, CD4, and leukocyte common antigen. These activated microglia decrease the ability for neurons to undergo long term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus and thereby reduce the ability to form memories.  Role in neurodegenerative disease  = Alzheimer's disease = Alzheimer's disease (AD) has historically been characterized by two major hallmarks: neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid-beta plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are insoluble aggregates of tau proteins, and amyloid-beta plaques are extracellular deposits of the amyloid-beta protein. Current thinking in AD pathology goes beyond these two typical hallmarks to suggest that a significant portion of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's is due to neuroinflammation. Activated microglia are seen in abundance in post-mortem AD brains. Current thought is that inflammatory cytokine-activated microglia cannot phagocytose amyloid-beta, which may contribute to plaque accumulation as opposed to clearance. Additionally, the inflammatory cytokine IL-1Œ≤ is upregulated in AD and is associated with decreases of synaptophysin and consequent synaptic loss. Further evidence that inflammation is associated with disease progression in AD is that persons that take non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) regularly have been associated with reduced AD later in life. Elevated inflammatory markers showed an association with accelerated brain aging, which might explain the link to neurodegeneration in AD-related brain regions. = Parkinson's disease = The leading hypothesis of Parkinson's disease progression includes neuroinflammation as a major component. This hypothesis stipulates that Stage 1 of Parkinson's disease begins in the gut, as evidenced by a large number of cases that begin with constipation. The inflammatory response in the gut may play a role in alpha- synuclein (Œ±-Syn) aggregation and misfolding, a characteristic of Parkinson's disease pathology. If there is a balance between good bacteria and bad bacteria in the gut, the bacteria may remain contained to the gut. However, dysbiosis of good bacteria and bad bacteria may cause a ‚Äúleaky‚Äù gut, creating an inflammatory response. This response aids Œ±-Syn misfolding and transfer across neurons, as the protein works its way up to the CNS. The brainstem is vulnerable to inflammation, which would explain Stage 2, including sleep disturbances and depression. In Stage 3 of the hypothesis, the inflammation affects the substantia nigra, the dopamine producing cells of the brain, beginning the characteristic motor deficits of Parkinson's disease. Stage 4 of Parkinson's disease includes deficits caused by inflammation in key regions of the brain that regulate executive function and memory. As evidence supporting this hypothesis, patients in Stage 3 (motor deficits) that are not experiencing cognitive deficits already show that there is neuroinflammation of the cortex. This suggests that neuroinflammation may be a precursor to the deficits seen in Parkinson's disease. = Multiple sclerosis = Multiple sclerosis is the most common disabling neurological disease of young adults. It is characterized by demyelination and neurodegeneration, which contribute to the common symptoms of cognitive deficits, limb weakness, and fatigue. In multiple sclerosis, inflammatory cytokines disrupt the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and allow for the migration of peripheral immune cells into the central nervous system. When they have migrated into the central nervous system, B cells and plasma cells produce antibodies against the myelin sheath that insulates neurons, degrading the myelin and slowing conduction in the neurons. Additionally, T cells may enter through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, be activated by local antigen presenting cells, and attack the myelin sheath. This has the same effect of degrading the myelin and slowing conduction. As in other neurodegenerative diseases, activated microglia produce inflammatory cytokines that contribute to widespread inflammation. It has been shown that inhibiting microglia decreases the severity of multiple sclerosis.  Role as a therapeutic target  = Drug therapy = Because neuroinflammation has been associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, there is increasing interest to determine whether reducing inflammation will reverse neurodegeneration. Inhibiting inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1Œ≤, decreases neuronal loss seen in neurodegenerative diseases. Current treatments for multiple sclerosis include interferon-B, Glatiramer acetate, and Mitoxantrone, which function by reducing or inhibiting T Cell activation, but have the side effect of systemic immunosuppression In Alzheimer's disease, the use of non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decreases the risk of developing the disease. Current treatments for Alzheimer's disease include NSAIDs and glucocorticoids. NSAIDs function by blocking conversion of prostaglandin H2 into other prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxane (TX). Prostoglandins and thromboxane act as inflammatory mediators and increase microvascular permeability. = Exercise = Exercise is a promising mechanism of prevention and treatment for various diseases characterized by neuroinflammation. Aerobic exercise is used widely to reduce inflammation in the periphery. Exercise has been shown to decrease proliferation of microglia in the brain, decrease hippocampal expression of immune-related genes, and reduce expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-Œ±.

For example, neurodegenerative diseases can cause different physiological effects in males and females. In particular, estrogen studies have revealed complex interactions with neurodegenerative diseases. Estrogen was initially proposed to be a possible treatment for certain types of neurodegenerative diseases but a plethora of harmful side effects such as increased susceptibility to breast cancer and coronary heart disease overshadowed any beneficial outcomes. On the other hand, Estrogen Replacement Therapy has shown some positive effects with postmenopausal women. Estrogen and estrogen-like molecules form a large family of potentially beneficial alternatives that can have dramatic effects on human homeostasis and disease. Subsequently, large-scale efforts were initiated to screen for useful estrogen family molecules. Furthermore, scientists discovered new ways to synthesize estrogen-like compounds that can avoid many side effects.  Estrogen  17-alpha- vs 17-beta-estradiol Estrogen is a lipid hormone in humans can regulate many physiological processes. It is largely related to menstrual and estrous and its biological function is mediated by binding to two receptors: Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERŒ±) and Estrogen Receptor beta (ERŒ≤). These two receptors are tissue specific and have different influences on their downstream genes. A decrease in estrogen levels can lead to osteoporosis, cognitive disorders, and can affect many important genes related to normal physiological function. Estrogen can be divided into four classes: 1) Animal Estrogens that includes estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3); 2) Plant Estrogens (Phytoestrogens); 3) Fungi Estrogens (Mycoestrogens) and 4) Synthetic Estrogens (xenoestrogens). Xenoestrogens contain a large number of compounds that are synthesized or naturally exist. These estrogens imitate estrogen structure and can be designed to satisfy the need of new drugs. They may have a significant impact on neurodegenerative disease treatment due to their ease of synthesis and targeted specificity. = Application = The application of estrogen on medicine can be divided into a number of aspects. The best known ones are breast cancer and coronary heart disease. Estrogen also plays very important role in animal metabolism balance. These unexpected diseases hindered estrogen to get involved in neurodegenerative disease therapy. So, when applying estrogen-like drugs to relieve neurodegenerative diseases, the concentration should be restrictly controlled to avoid these side effects.  Neurodegenerative Diseases  Parasagittal MRI of human head in patient with benign familial macrocephaly prior to brain injury (ANIMATED) Neurodegenerative diseases are diseases caused along the process of neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration includes structural and functional loss of neurons or even the death of the neurons. The causes of such diseases can be various but can be concluded into four aspects: genetic mutation, protein misfolding, intracellular mechanisms and programmed cell death. Main classes of neurodegeneritive diseases are Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. = Efforts Made on Therapy = Different neurodegenerative diseases have different causes and are not well studied until now. There is no clear cure for such diseases but some efforts have been made to research deeper into them. The 10th Global College of Neuroproetction and Neuroregeneration Annual Conference together with the International Association of Neurorestoratology VI was held to discuss on neurorestoration, neuroprotection and neuroregeneration in various clinical neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease, stroke and brain or spinal cord injuries. The main aim was to enhance health care by the use of stem cells, nanodrug delivery of drugs and stem cells, use of multimodal drugs as well as a combination of different approaches. They concluded that the future of neuroprotection could be achieved by the use of stem cells and nanodrug delivery in chronic neurological disorders.  Estrogen and neurodegenerative diseases  Although estrogen is best known for its effects on the maturation and differentiation of the primary and secondary sex organs, increasing evidence suggests that its influence extends beyond this system, and its activity in the CNS may initiate, or influence our susceptibility to neurodegenerative decline. Estrogen has been proposed to act as a neuroprotectant at several levels, and it is probable that deprivation of estrogen as a result of menopause exposes the aging or diseased brain to several insults. In addition, estrogen deprivation is likely to initiate or enhance degenerative changes caused by oxidative stress, and to reduce the brain's ability to maintain synaptic connectivity and cholinergic integrity leading to the cognitive decline seen in aged and disease-afflicted individuals. There is sufficient evidence that estradiol is a powerful neuroprotectant which might have use against AD, stroke and Parkinson's disease both in women and men. = Estrogen and Alzheimer's disease = This figure shows how APP cleavage produces toxic Abeta in Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid plaques formed by amyloid-Œ≤ (AŒ≤) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles formed by tau protein phosphorylation are dominant physiological features of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolysis is fundamental for production of AŒ≤ peptides implicated in AD pathology. By using a cell line that contains high levels of estrogen receptors, scientists found that treatment with physiological concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol is associated with accumulation in the conditioned medium of an amino-terminal cleavage product of APP (soluble APP or protease nexin-2), indicative of non-amyloidogenic processing. =Estrogen and Parkinson's disease= Recommendations on the use of postmenopausal hormonal replacement therapy in women with Parkinson's disease or those genetically at risk. But another group of scientists found a positive association between estrogen use and lower symptom severity in women with early PD not yet taking L-dopa. =Estrogen and Huntington's disease= Huntington's disease (HD) is a polyglutamine disorder based on an expanded CAG triplet repeat leading to cerebral and striatal neurodegeneration. Potential sex differences concerning the age of onset and the course of the disease are poorly defined, as the difficulties of matching female and male HD patients regarding their CAG repeat lengths limit comparability. =Estrogen and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis= ALS occurs more commonly in men than in women, and women get the disease later in life compared to men. This suggested the possible protective role of estrogen in ALS. By conducting treatment of 17Œ≤-estradiol to ovariectomy treated mice, scientists found significantly delay of disease progression.  Estrogen Replacement Therapy  Estrogen Replacement Therapy (HRT) is a kind of hormone replacement therapy. Its goal is to mitigate discomfort caused by diminished circulating estrogen after menopause. The 2002 Women's Health Initiative of the National Institutes of Health found disparate results for all cause mortality with hormone replacement, finding it to be lower when HRT was begun earlier, between age 50-59, but higher when begun after age 60. In older patients, there was an increased incidence of breast cancer, heart attacks and stroke, although a reduced incidence of colorectal cancer and bone fracture. Some of the WHI findings were again found in a larger national study done in the UK, known as The Million Women Study. As a result of these findings, the number of women taking hormone treatment dropped precipitously. The Women's Health Initiative recommended that women with non-surgical menopause take the lowest feasible dose of HRT for the shortest possible time to minimize associated risks. = Main Pathways = The role of estrogens is mostly mediated by two nuclear receptors (ER alpha and ER beta) and a membrane-associated G-protein (GPR30 or GPER), and it is not limited to reproduction, but it extends to the skeletal, cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Various pathologies such as cancer, inflammatory, neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases are often associated with dysfunctions of the estrogen system. Therapeutic interventions by agents that affect the estrogen signaling pathway might be useful in the treatment of many dissimilar diseases. These pathways also shown great impact on neurodegenerative disease. = Application = The receptors of estrogen are specially distributed in different tissues, which have different influence on their downstream genes. The activation of the two different estrogen receptors has different effects on human. ERŒ± and ERŒ≤ also mediate Selective estrogen-receptor modulators' (SERMs') function, but the selective ERŒ± agitator can always cause some side effects such as breast cancer or endometrial hyperplasia, while the selective ERŒ≤ agitator may play an active effect on such diseases. So, the selective ERŒ≤ agitator has more clinical value for neurodegenerative diseases). In post-menopausal women, high levels of testosterone and estrogen higher the risk 2-3 times than lower level situation. Women that are not taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have lesser risk of breast cancer because of the insulin level increase. Nonsteroidal estrogens and neurodegenerative diseases Nonsteroidal estrogens include xenoestrogens, phytoestrogens and mycoestrogens. They are very useful in neurodegenerative diseases' therapy when considering about the side effects caused by estradiol. As the development of chemical synthesis, it becomes possible for people to construct new molecules. Drug companies can exploit naturally existing compounds and synthetic compounds that have estrogen-like activity to produce patented proprietary drugs, especially the contraceptives. Phytoestrogens are plant derived estrogens and have similar structures with 17beta-estradiol thus may cause estrogenic or anti-estrogenic effects.Phytoestrogen = Application = Nonsteroidal estrogens prevalently exist in our environment and have both positive and negative effects on our daily life. But as a possible way to get access to neurodegenerative disease treatment, scientists have developed multiple ways to screen these estrogens and select the ones that have less side effects. Bipartite recombinant yeast system and dual fluorescence report system are designed to screen these potential chemicals.

Many times such scarves are attached to places of particular interest or significance. Place attachment is the emotional bond between person and place, and is a main concept in environmental psychology. It is highly influenced by an individual and his or her personal experiences. There is a considerable amount of research dedicated to defining what makes a place \\"meaningful\\" enough for place attachment to occur. Schroeder (1991) notably discussed the difference between \\"meaning\\" and \\"preference,\\" defining meaning as \\"the thoughts, feelings, memories and interpretations evoked by a landscape\\" and preference as \\"the degree of liking for one landscape compared to another.\\" Place attachment is multi-dimensional and cannot be explained simply through a cause and effect relationship. Instead, it depends on a reciprocal relationship between behavior and experiences. Due to numerous varying opinions on the definition and components of place attachment, organizational models have been scarce until recent years. A noteworthy conceptual framework is the Tripartite Model, developed by Scannell and Gifford (2010), which defines the variables of place attachment as the three P‚Äôs: Person, Process, and Place. When describing place attachment, scholars differentiate between a ‚Äúrootedness‚Äù and a ‚Äúsense of place‚Äù. Sense of place attachment arises as the result of cultivation of meaning and artifacts associated with created places. Due to constant migration over the past few centuries, Americans are thought to most commonly have this type of place attachment, as they have not stayed in a place long enough to develop storied roots. Rootedness, on the other hand, is an unconscious attachment to a place due to familiarity achieved through continuous residence‚Äì‚Äìperhaps that of a familial lineage that has known this place in the years before the current resident. Little is known about the neurological changes that make place attachment possible because of the exaggerated focus on social aspects by environmental psychologists, the difficulties in measuring place attachment over time, and the heavy influence of individualistic experiences and emotions on the degree of attachment.  Tripartite model  = Person = The Person dimension addresses the question of, \\"who is attached?\\" When examined individually, places often gain meaning because of personal experiences, life milestones, and occurrences of personal growth. With communities, however, places derive religious, historical, or other cultural meanings. Community behaviors contribute not only to place attachment experienced by citizens of that community as a group, but also to those citizens individually. For example, desires to preserve ecological or architectural characteristics of a place have a direct impact on the strength of place attachment felt by individuals, notably through self-pride and self-esteem. People experience stronger attachments to places that they can identify with or otherwise feel proud to be a part of. = Process = The process dimension answers the question ‚ÄúHow does the attachment exist?‚Äù Similar to other concepts in social psychology, this dimension relies on the collective effects of affective, cognitive, and behavioral aspects. Recent research has also explored the symbolic connotations that are thought to be a part of the process.  Affect  Drawing from attachment theory, affective bonds are thought to arise out of relationships that provide for functional needs, like security and wellbeing. The most common emotions associated with people-place bonding are positive, such as happiness and love. Yi-Fu Tuan, a noteworthy human geographer and pioneer in place attachment research, coined the term topophilia to describe the love that people feel for particular places. Negative emotions and experiences are also capable of giving places significance; however, negative emotions are usually not associated with people-place bonding since place attachment represents individuals‚Äô yearnings to replicate positive experiences and emotions.  Cognition  Cognition incorporates the knowledge, memories, and meanings that individuals or groups have associated with places of attachment. Specifically, these cognitive elements represent what makes specific places important enough for people- place bonding to develop. Environmental psychologists additionally use the term schema to describe how people organize their beliefs and knowledge in regards to places and has led some researchers to note familiarity as a central cognitive element in place attachment. This idea of familiarity has been used in explaining why people mark themselves as ‚Äúcity people‚Äù or why they develop preferences for certain types of homes. Researchers have coined a number of terms based on familiarity, including ‚Äúsettlement identity‚Äù and ‚Äúgeneric place dependence.‚Äù  Behavior  Behavior is the physical manifestation of place attachment and can represent the cognitive and affective elements that an individual possesses in their person-place bonds. Proximity-maintaining behaviors have been noted as common behaviors among people who have attachment of place, similar to those who have interpersonal attachments. Many individuals unknowingly experience the effects of place attachment through homesickness and will carry out proximity-maintaining behaviors to satisfy their desires to relieve it by returning home or reinventing their current environments to match the characteristics of home. This reinvention of current environments has been coined as reconstruction of place and is a notable place attachment behavior. Reconstruction of place often occurs when communities are rebuilding after natural disasters or war. As counterintuitive as it may seem, trips and even pilgrimages away from places can enhance a person-place bond because individuals grow an increased appreciation for the places they have left behind, contributing to feelings of nostalgia that often accompany attachment and the memories that places evoke. = Place = The Place dimension addresses the question of, ‚Äúwhat is attached?‚Äù and can be applied to any geographic type. Many researchers stress that place attachment relies on both physical and social aspects. Attachment to a place bears no regard to the size of it and can occur in places small (i.e. a room or house) and large (i.e. communities and cities). As such, scholars have studied place attachment in a multitude of settings. A common finding throughout many of these studies is that place attachment is thought to increase with greater time spent at it. Further, scholars speculate that place attachment is developed through lived experiences in a place, rather than the symbolic value that is often assigned to places of public value that one may have never visited. Childhood memories are thought to be particularly poignant and an aspect of early place attachment, with attachments formed to places that offered both privacy and the opportunity to engage in fantasy, for example, bedrooms and outdoor landscapes. Smith (2017) has identified the following typology of places that takes into account both their physical and social attributes. Secure places: places that people have some of the strongest identified bonds with. These are places with stability and continuity. The home is most often associated as a secure place. Socializing places: these are places with a strong identified community. They may serve as a gathering space; for example, plazas. Transformative places: these are places associated with autobiographical recall that are attached to memories as places of importance. Restorative places: places that induce physiological reactions. These are often peaceful and natural areas with aesthetic beauty. Outdoor areas like national parks often fall into this category. Validating places: these are places with cultural significance and shared meaning. Vanishing places: these are places that are transforming from the place that humans commonly associate them with. This may be due to natural or man-made destruction; depletion of natural resources or features; encroachment, where incoming cultures are transforming the meaning of places; and restriction, where particular activities are limited.  Social  There is debate among environmental psychologists that place attachment occurs due to the social relationships that exist within the realm of an individual's significant place rather than the physical characteristics of the place itself. Some scholars have proposed that sense of place is socially constructed, and that social ties are predictors of place attachment. Hidalgo and Hern√°ndez (2001) studied levels of attachment based on different dimensions and found that while social aspects were stronger than physical ones, both affected the overall person-place bond.  Physical  Natural and built environments can both be subjects of person-place bonds. The resources that these environments provide are the most tangible aspects that can induce attachment. These resources can lead to the development of place dependence. Place dependence negatively correlates with environmental press, which can be defined as the demands and stresses that an environment puts on people physically, interpersonally, or socially. Conversely, intangible aspects of environments can also promote attachment. In particular, the characteristics and symbolic representations that an individual associates with his or her perceptions of self are pivotal in the person-place bond.  Places of attachment  = Attachment to the home = The home has long been studied as a place of attachment, with scholars recognizing the affective bonds people develop to their residence. Early work by Fried (1966) examined West End Bostonians reactions of grief in response to relocation from their residences. Fried postulated that this pointed to the spatial and social significance of the home and sense of continuity it creates for individuals everyday routines and relationships. The home is a symbol of domestic life. It is thought to represent security and emotional attachment, which Smith has equated with a ‚Äúwomb-like‚Äùplace. The home is also particularly relevant in childhood memories, where children spend most of their time during their formative years. Possession and control of the home have been found to heighten sense of place attachment. Scholars have found that sense of attachment increases with home ownership, as opposed to renting. Further, territoriality, the ability to exercise control over the space, is thought to be a central feature of the attachment to the home in that it embodies privacy. Of this, forms of attachment to the home are thought to include ‚Äúhome experience‚Äù, ‚Äúrootedness‚Äù and ‚Äúidentity‚Äù. = Attachment to neighborhoods = Neighborhoods are community areas without officially constructed borders, the boundaries for which are primarily construed by individual residents based on amenities and points of interest within walking distance. Factors that are thought to influence neighborhood attachment include assimilation into the social community (length of residence, interest in neighborhood occurrences, and relationships with others), engagement with local institutions and organizations, and the makeup of the neighborhood itself (size, density, and socioeconomic class). Studies looking at neighborhood diversity have found that people in homogenous neighborhoods are more likely to report place attachment; likewise, there is a negative correlation between increased neighborhood diversity and place attachment. = Attachment to landscapes = Place attachment can occur on landscapes of varying significance. For ordinary landscapes, that attachment is often one of biological utility (i.e. ones that offer food and shelter), cultural significance, or experience within an individual‚Äôs lifetime (particularly childhood). The evidence for a relationship between place attachment and place stewardship has been mixed. Scholars have noted relationships between attachment and environmental stewardship; for example, increased likelihood of recycling and limiting water use, support for recreational areas, and engagement with community organizations. However, multiple others have failed to find relationships. Willingness to intervene on behalf of the environment may be dependent upon whether the attachment is primarily due to the physical or social attributes of the environment. Scannell and Gifford found that people with greater attachment to the physical location were more likely to engage with it.  Developmental theories  There is very little research dedicated to the underlying developmental and neurological processes for place attachment, which is a major criticism of the field. Suggested developmental theories include the mere-exposure effect and the security-exploration cycle. Environmental psychologists have recognized parallels between the attachment theory and the development of place attachment, but the attachment theory at times fails to recognize place as a playing piece and instead classifies it as a background for attachment relationships. The security-exploration cycle indicates that a place can become the target of attachment when it incorporates both security and exploration. For example, the home, a popular object of attachment, typically possesses a safe or familiar indoor environment and an outdoor space that satisfies desires to explore and expand knowledge. This example is capitalized upon by Morgan (2010), who proposed a combination of human attachment and place attachment in a model called the Exploration-Assertion Motivational System, which suggests that the strongest attachments originate during childhood. The model states that place attachment forms due to a cycle of repeated arousals and behaviors that are linked to both places and attachment figures. As a result of this balance between exploration and attachment behavior, children receive positive reinforcements in the forms of connectedness and a sense of adventure and mastery. Despite the absence of a well-established developmental theory and understanding of the neurological changes that accompany place attachment, most researchers agree that some form of place attachment occurs for each person at some point in his or her lifetime, with childhood homes being the most prevalent object of attachment.  Scientific research  = Predictors of attachment = There is a desire among researchers to create a list of concrete variables that account for differing extents of place attachment among individuals. It is believed that increased length of residence in a location increases the attachment a person has to that location. Place attachment tends to develop fast in early years of life and in a short time of residence, it helps that a person visits constantly the same place and no others, making, place attachment and place identity settle and grow. Over extended periods of time, place identity can develop. Place identity is defined as an individual's perception of self as a member of a particular environment. Other proposed positively correlated variables are ownership (i.e. of home, land) and social interactions. Some inversely related variables that have been suggested are building size and age. = Place Identity = This construct is usually mistaken with place attachment, even if they develop from different causes. Place attachment develops from positive experiences and the satisfactory relationship between a person and a place, while place identity comes from beliefs, meanings, emotions, ideas and attitudes assigned to a place. = Place dependence or functional attachment = Defined as a functional relationship based on the conditions provided for a place in order to satisfy the needs of a person or accomplish a specific goal. Also depends on how is evaluated in other places, answering the question, \\"What can I do in this place that I can't do in other places?\\". Functional attachment depends on certain characteristics related to the place, as how much this area is compatible with a person, as they can carry out their activities and goals, this type of attachment is common in those who practice green exercise. This kind of attachment grows exponentially in relation to the number of visits. = Benefits = The benefits related to place attachment include the ability to build memories as the person is capable to connect with his ancestors past, the feeling of belonging to a place, the personal growth as it provides the opportunity to experience positive emotions as a result from a healthy relationship with the place, so the person can feel security and freedom. = Measuring attachment = Psychometric and Likert scales are the most commonly used quantitative methods for different dimensions of place attachment, such as belongingness and identity. Meanings of places are often quantitatively studied by asking participants to score a set list of places on the basis of 12 categories: aesthetic, heritage, family connection, recreation, therapeutic, biological diversity, wilderness, home, intrinsic, spiritual, economic, life-sustaining, learning, and future. Another example of quantitative measurements are frequency counts with word associations. Qualitative research has been conducted with the intention to gain insight into meanings that places possess. Some of the techniques used for qualitative research are free association tasks, in-depth interviews, and verbal reports from focus groups. = Memory association = Memories combine sensations and perceptions to create images that can be used to retain and recall information or past experiences. Over time, memories collectively allow an individual to develop feelings of familiarity that comprise a sense of place. When an interactive experience with three-dimensional space does not match these developed expectations, an individual adapts his or her understanding of place through learning and sensory input. For this reason, places are frequently associated with memories that can evoke physical senses. The plasticity of memories means that place identities are subject to change. Memories of places and individual preferences for specific places both change over time. Adults tend to focus on the emotions, meanings, and contextual implications of feelings in association with places. Children, however, focus on physical aspects of environments and what can be performed in various environments, which can be seen in the popularity of ‚Äúpretend‚Äù and imagination games among children. Consequently, childhood memories of places are typically oriented around heavily emotional, intense, or euphoric events.  Applications  = Disaster psychology = A healthy emotional relationship between a city or neighborhood and its inhabitants maintains the culture and positive attitudes despite any detrimental events that may be occurring in that city or neighborhood (i.e. people having an increased sense of security even if they live in a war zone). When forced relocation occurs, refugees experience a grieving process similar to when loved ones are lost. Through reconstruction of place, the familiarity of an attachment to places lost can be mimicked to relieve stress and grief. = Space planning = An understanding of the psychological factors responsible for place attachment is important for the effective development of place loyalty that allows cities and towns to flourish. Additionally, successful places address the needs or maintain the cultural integrities and meanings that communities have placed upon them. More specifically, additions of buildings or monuments and creation of outdoor recreational spaces must be well-aligned with a community‚Äôs place attachment to prevent backlash from inhabitants that do not agree with the intended land developments. = Senior communities = Environmental press is often considered with elderly populations transitioning into assisted living or senior communities. Improving the overall community psychology and sense of community can allow place attachment to develop for both individuals and groups. Developing new place attachment is usually more difficult with increased age, and as a result, recently transitioned senior adults and senior communities are popular subjects for research in order to test the efficacy of various community-building techniques, such as celebrations and neighborhood political organizations.

He is considered the father of the group of modernist architecture practitioners, that includes Paul Rudolph and Jack West, and other modernist architects who were active in the Sarasota area in the 1950s and 1960s like Ralph and William Zimmerman, Gene Leedy, Mark Hampton, Edward ‚ÄúTim‚Äù Seibert, Victor Lundy, William Rupp, Bert Brosmith, Frank Folsom Smith, James Holiday, Joseph Farrell and Carl Abbott. He bridged the more traditional architecture of his early work in Florida during the 1920s with his modernist designs that began in the 1940s. Education and early career Twitchell was born to Albert John and Ella Callista (Downs) Twitchell in Mansfield, Ohio. After the untimely death of his father in 1906, his mother moved the family to Winter Park, Florida. Twitchell enrolled in Rollins College, but transferred to McGill University, Montreal, in 1910 to study architecture. In 1912, Twitchell transferred schools again, to Columbia University. After his 1917-19 World War I military service, Twitchell graduated from Columbia with a Bachelor of Arts degree in architecture in 1920 and a Masters in Architecture in 1921. Twitchell first came to Sarasota in 1925 as the representative of New York architect Dwight James Baum to manage the final stages of the construction of John Ringling's C√† d'Zan, a Venetian-style mansion on the Sarasota Bay. Florida was in the midst of a land boom. Twitchell purchased thirteen lots in the Ravellan Gardens bayside neighborhood of Sarasota and designed Mediterranean architecture homes on these lots. Lauded in the press, the promise of the project evaporated when the Florida real estate bubble collapsed in 1926 (some surviving homes have been included on the National Register of Historic Places). Twitchell retreated to the Northeast and more favorable economic climate. Sarasota School of Architecture In 1936, Twitchell moved permanently to Sarasota to open his own architectural and construction company, Associated Builders. Among his earliest commissions were a Siesta Key residence for author MacKinlay Kantor and the Lido Beach Casino. In the following years, Twitchell (influenced by the innovative architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright and LeCorbusier) began experimenting with reinforced concrete and glass structures, facilitating a more modernist approach. In 1938, the American Institute of Architects revoked Twitchell's membership, primarily due to Twitchell's ownership of a construction company. At that time, the profession took a dim view of architects engaged in construction. Twitchell believed, however, that the Florida landscape required a unique understanding of building site planning that could be only be accomplished by merging design and construction. The revocation had no bearing on his ability to work. In 1976, two years before his death, the AIA reversed its decision and recognized Twitchell for his career achievements by naming him \\"Architect Emeritus.\\" In the summer of 1941, Twitchell hired Paul Rudolph, 28 years his younger, after Rudolph completed his studies at the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (today, Auburn University) and before he began attending Harvard University's Graduate School of Design. Rudolph, like Twitchell, was fixated on vanguard architecture, and the two collaborated on a number of projects (including Twitchell's own residence) in the months prior to Rudolph's departure for graduate studies. Rudolph returned to Twitchell's Siesta Key office in 1946 and partnered with him until 1951. Rudolph focused on the idea of the structure while Twitchell prioritized construction details. Typically, each project required three or four iterations, expressed sequentially, until the initial creative concept became rooted to the specifics of its site. During this time, Twitchell and Rudolph designed many ground-breaking private residences that are the foundation of the Sarasota School of Architecture, including the Miller House and Guest Cottage (1947), the Revere Quality House (1948), the Lamolithic Houses (1948), the Healy Guest House (Cocoon House 1950), and the Leavengood Residence in St. Petersburg, Florida (1951). The Revere Quality House, with rooms that opened out onto terraces and landscaped areas, was the first poured concrete house on Siesta Key. Such open design was reflective of the Sarasota School of Architecture philosophy: clarity of construction, maximum economy of means, clear geometry, and honesty in details. Twitchell and Rudolph parted ways in 1951. Between 1953 and 1954, Twitchell partnered with another \\"Sarasota School\\" architect, Jack West, and between 1959 and 1965 with his son, Tollyn Jules Twitchell.

Georges Hulin de Loo (10 December 1862, in Ghent ‚Äì 27 December 1945, in Brussels) was a Belgian art historian specialising in Early Netherlandish art. He was educated in his home city of Ghent where he attended high school and university, earning a Ph.D from the Faculty of Arts in 1883, and a degree in law three years later. He then traveled to Germany and Paris to continue his studies, returning to Ghent in 1889 to take up a teaching position the University of Ghent in a variety of subjects such as logic and law.Hulin de Loo Dictionary of Art Historians. Retrieved 18 November 2013 After visiting the 1902 Bruges exhibition of Netherlandish art (Exposition de tableaux flamands des XIVe, XVe et XVIe si√®cles) he published an independent critical catalogue with Alfons Siffer, highlighting the large number of mistakes in the official catalogue which had used attributions and descriptions from the owners. He went on to become a leading scholar in the field.Ridderbos, Bernhard; Van Buren, Anne; Van Veen, Henk. Early Netherlandish Paintings: Rediscovery, Reception and Research. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2005. , p. 275 He wrote a separate introduction to the catalogue in which he speculated about the painters' identities (De l‚Äôidentit√© de certains ma√Ætres anonymes), followed by publications about Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Jan Provoost. He was the first art historian to suggest that Robert Campin was in the fact the painter known as the Master of Flemalle and to identify Roger van der Weyden as an apprentice to Campin. In 1911 he studied and published a study of the Turin- Milan Hours suggesting a number of miniatures were painted by Hubert and Jan van Eyck, an assertion which continues to be a contentious issue among art historians. Hulin became active in the art community, sat on committees and associations, and was a consulting editor to The Burlington Magazine. He continued in his teaching position at Ghent University, however, when in 1930 the university became a Flemish speaking institution, he retired soon after. He continued to write, publishing a biography of Roger van der Weyden in 1938. Along with Max Friedl√§nder, who also visited the 1902 Bruges exhibition and wrote a review, Hulin became a leading scholar in the field of Netherlandish art. He died unmarried and without children in 1945.

Phase resetting in neurons is when the dynamical behavior of an oscillation is shifted. This occurs when a stimulus perturbs the phase within an oscillatory cycle and a change in period occurs. The periods of these oscillations can vary depending on the biological system, with examples such as: (1) neural responses can change within a millisecond to quickly relay information; (2) In cardiac and respiratory changes that occur throughout the day, could be within seconds; (3) circadian rhythms may vary throughout a series of days; (4) rhythms such as hibernation may have periods that are measured in years.Krogh-Madsen, Trine, et al. \\"Phase Resetting Neural Oscillators: Topological Theory Versus the RealWorld.\\" Phase response curves in neuroscience. Springer New York, 2012. 33-51. This activity pattern of neurons is a phenomenon seen in various neural circuits throughout the body and is seen in single neuron models and within clusters of neurons. Many of these models utilize phase response (resetting) curves where the oscillation of a neuron is perturbed and the effect the perturbation has on the phase cycle of a neuron is measured. History Leon Glass and Michael Mackey (1988) developed the theory behind limit cycle oscillators to observe the effects of perturbing oscillating neurons under the assumption the stimulus applied only affected the phase cycle and not the amplitude of response. Phase resetting plays a role in promoting neural synchrony in various pathways in the brain, from regulating circadian rhythms and heartbeat via cardiac pacemaker cells to playing significant roles in memory, pancreatic cells and neurodegenerative diseases such as epilepsy. Burst of activity in patterns of behaviors occur through coupled oscillators using pulsatile signals, better known as pulse-coupled oscillators. Methodology of study =Phase response curve= Shifts in phase (or behavior of neurons) caused due to a perturbation (an external stimulus) can be quantified within a Phase Response Curve (PRC) to predict synchrony in coupled and oscillating neurons. These effects can be computed, in the case of advances or delays to responses, to observe the changes in the oscillatory behavior of neurons, pending on when a stimulus was applied in the phase cycle of an oscillating neuron. The key to understanding this is in the behavioral patterns of neurons and the routes neural information travels. Neural circuits are able to communicate efficiently and effectively within milliseconds of experiencing a stimulus and lead to the spread of information throughout the neural network. The study of neuron synchrony could provide information on the differences that occur in neural states such as normal and diseased states. Neurons that are involved significantly in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease are shown to undergo phase resetting before launching into phase locking where clusters of neurons are able to begin firing rapidly to communicate information quickly. phase of ongoing oscillatory activity is reset. A phase response curve can be calculated by noting changes to its period over time depending on where in the cycle the input is applied. The perturbation left by the stimulus moves the stable cycle within the oscillation followed by a return to the stable cycle limit. The curve tracks the amount of advancement or delay due to the input in the oscillating neuron. The PRC assumes certain patterns of behavior in firing pattern as well as the network of oscillating neurons to model the oscillations. Currently, only a few circuits exist which can be modeled using an assumed firing pattern. In order to model the behavior of firing neural circuits, the following is calculated to generate a PRC curve and its trajectory. The period T_0 is defined as the unperturbed period of an oscillator from the phase cycle defined as 0‚â§ ‚àÖ ‚â§1 and the cycle that has undergone a perturbation is known as T_1 as shown in the following equation. An advance in phase occurs when trajectory of the motion is displaced in the direction of the motion due a shortening of period whereas a phase delay occurs when the displacement occurs in the opposite direction of motion. :F(\\\\varnothing)=\\\\frac{(T_1-T_0)}{T_0} =Types of phase response curves= If the perturbation to the oscillatory cycle is infinitesimally small, it is possible to derive a response function of the neural oscillator. This response function can be classified into different classes (Type 1 and Type 2) based upon its response. #Type I Phase Response Curves are non-negative and strictly positive thus perturbations are only able to enhance a spike in phase, but never delay it. This occurs through a slight depolarization, such as postsynaptic potentials that increase the excitation of an axon. Type I PRCs are also shown to fire more slowly towards the onset of firing. Examples of Models that exhibit Type I PRCs in weakly coupled neural oscillators include the Connor and the Morris‚ÄìLecar model. #Type II Phase Response Curves can have negative and positive regions. Due to this characteristic, Type II PRCs are able to advance or delay changes in phase pending on the timing of perturbation that occurs. These curves can also have abrupt onset of firing and due to this, are unable to fire below their threshold. An example of a Type II PRC is seen within the Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model. =Assumptions of phase response curves= Numerous research has suggested two primary assumptions that allow the use of PRCs to be used to predict the occurrence of synchrony within neural oscillation. These assumptions work to show synchrony within coupled neurons that are linked to other neurons. The first assumption claims that coupling between neurons must be weak and requires an infinitesimally small phase change in response to a perturbation. The second assumption assumes coupling between neurons to be pulsatile where the perturbation to calculate PRC should only include those inputs that are received within the circuit. This leads to a limitation of each phase being completed within a reset before another perturbation can be received. The main difference between the two assumptions is for pulsatile the effects of any inputs must be known or measured prior. In weak coupling, only the magnitude of response due to a perturbation needs to be measured to calculate phase resetting. The weak coupling also induces the claim that many cycles must occur prior to convergence of oscillators to phase lock to lead to synchronization. =Conditions for validity of phase response curve= Much argument still exists in whether the assumptions behind phase resetting are valid for analysis of neural activity leading to synchronization and other neural properties. Event-related Potential (ERP) is a commonly used measure to the response of the brain to different events and can be measured via electroencephalography (EEG). EEGs can be used to measured electrical activity throughout the brain noninvasively. The Phase Response Curve operates under the following criteria and must occur to prove that phase resetting is the cause of the behavior: #An oscillation must already be occurring before it can reset in its phase. This implies that resetting in response to a stimulus can only occur if the oscillation pre-existed before the reset. #If due to resetting of oscillation leads to the formation of ERP, the ERP must show similar characteristics. #The neural sources responsible for the generation of the ERP must be the same as ongoing oscillation to be considered phase resetting. =Arguments for and against phase resetting model= Arguments that claim the activity pattern observed in neurons is not phase resetting, but could instead be the response to evoked potentials (ERPs), include: #If the ERP was generated due to phase resetting, measuring the phase concentration alone is not enough to prove that phase resetting is occurring. An example of this is measuring while filtering data as this may actually induce an artificial oscillation in response to perturbation. It has been suggested that this argument may be overcome if there is no increase in power of the phase reset from pre-stimulus to post-stimulus. #The amplitude and phase of ongoing oscillations at the time a stimulus is applied should influence the ERP once generated by current oscillations. This argument is overcome if the amplitude or phase of current oscillations is affected and creates an ERP, and cannot be assumed to be an independent event. Biological occurrences =Epilepsy= Epilepsy is traditionally viewed as a disease resulting from hypersynchronous neural activity. Research has shown that specific changes in the topology of neural networks and their increase in synaptic strength can move into hyper-excited states. Normal networks of neurons fire in synchronous patterns that lead to communication; if this behavior is excited further, it can lead to \\"bursting\\" and significantly increase this communication. This increase then leads to over-activation of neural networks and finally to seizures. Diseases such as epilepsy demonstrate how synchrony amongst neural networks must be highly regulated to prevent asynchronous activity. The study of neural regulation could help to outline methods to reduce symptoms of asynchronous activity such as that observed in epilepsy. Neuron in the hippocampus of an epileptic patient =Memory= Phase resetting is important in the formation of long-term memories. Due to synchronization within the gamma-frequency range has been shown to be followed by phase resetting of theta oscillations when phase-locked by a stimulus. This shows increased neural synchrony, due to connections within neural networks, during the formation of memories by reactivating certain networks continuously. During memory tasks that required quick formation of memories, phase resetting within alpha activity increased the strength of the memories. =Hippocampus= Theta phase precession is a phenomenon observed in the hippocampus of rats and relates to the timing of neural spikes. When rats navigate around their environment, there are certain neurons in the hippocampus that fire (spike) when the animal is near a familiar landmark. Each neuron is tuned to a particular unique landmark, and for that reason, these neurons are called place cells. Curiously, it turns out that when a place cell fires is determined by how far the animal is from the landmark. There is a background oscillation in the hippocampus in the theta band (4 ‚Äì 8 Hz). As the animal approaches the landmark, the spiking of the place cell moves earlier in phase relative to the background theta oscillation, so that the phase offset essentially measures or represents the distance. This phase shifting relative to spatial distance is called phase precession.

The procedure, which inserts a small probe to freeze the target nerve, can facilitate complete regeneration of the structure and function of the affected nerve. Cryoneurolysis has been used to treat a variety of painful conditions. Medical uses A similar procedure that uses radiofrequency energy for back pain appears to have short term benefit, but it is unclear if it has a long term effect. Mechanisms of action =Nerve anatomy= Each nerve is composed of a bundle of axons. Each axon is surrounded by the endoneurium connective tissue layer. These axons are bundled into fascicles surrounded by the perineurium connective tissue layer. Multiple fascicles are then surrounded by the epineurium, which is the outermost connective tissue layer of the nerve. The axons of myelinated nerves have a myelin sheath made up of Schwann cells that coat the axon. =Nerve injury classification= x300px Classification of nerve damage was well-defined by Sir Herbert Seddon and Sunderland in a system that remains in use. The adjacent table details the forms (neurapraxia, axonotmesis and neurotmesis) and degrees of nerve injury that occur as a result of exposure to various temperatures. Cryoneurolysis treatments that use nitrous oxide (boiling point of -88.5 ¬∞C) as the coolant fall in the range of an axonotmesis injury, or 2nd degree injury, according to the Sunderland classification system. Treatments of the nerve in this temperature range are reversible. Nerves treated in this temperature range experience a disruption of the axon, with Wallerian degeneration occurring distal to the site of injury. The axon and myelin sheath are affected, but all of the connective tissues (endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium) remain intact. Following Wallerian degeneration, the axon regenerates along the original nerve path at a rate of approximately 1‚Äì2 mm per day. Cryoneurolysis differs from cryoablation in that cryoablation treatments utilize liquid nitrogen (boiling point of -195.8 ¬∞C) as the coolant, and therefore, fall into the range of a neurotmesis injury, or 3rd degree injury according to the Sunderland classification. Treatments of the nerve in this temperature range are irreversible. Nerves treated in this temperature range experience a disruption of both the axon and the endoneurium connective tissue layer. History The use of cold for pain relief and as an anti-inflammatory has been known since the time of Hippocrates (460-377 B.C). Since then there have been numerous accounts of ice used for pain relief including from the Ancient Egyptians and Avicenna of Persia (A.D.982‚Äì1070). In 1812 Napoleon's Surgeon General noted that half-frozen soldiers from the Moscow battle were able to tolerate amputations with reduced pain and in 1851, ice and salt mixtures were promoted by Arnott for the treatment of nerve pain. Campbell White, in 1899, was the first to use refrigerants medically, and Allington, in 1950, was the first to use liquid nitrogen for medical treatments. In 1961, Cooper et al. created an early cryoprobe that reached -190 ¬∞C using liquid nitrogen. Shortly thereafter, in 1967, an ophthalmic surgeon named Amoils used carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide to create a cryoprobe that reached -70 ¬∞C. Devices =Cryoprobe= Cryoneurolysis is performed with a cryoprobe, which is composed of a hollow cannula that contains a smaller inner lumen. The pressurized coolant (nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide or liquid nitrogen) travels down the lumen and expands at the end of the lumen into the tip of the hollow cannula. No coolant exits the cryoprobe. The expansion of the pressurized liquid causes the surrounding area to cool (known as the Joule-Thomson effect) and the phase change of the liquid to gas also causes the surrounding area to cool. This causes a visible iceball to form and the tissue surrounding the end of the cryoprobe to freeze. The gas form of the coolant then travels up the length of the cryoprobe and is safely expelled. The tissue surrounding the end of the cryoprobe can reach as low as -88.5 ¬∞C with nitrous oxide as the coolant, and as low as -195.8 ¬∞C with liquid nitrogen. Temperatures below -100 ¬∞C are damaging to nerves. =Other Devices= The Endocare PerCryo Percutaneous Cryoablation device utilizes argon as a coolant and can be used with 4 different single cryoprobe configurations with a diameter of either 1.7 mm (~16 gauge) or 2.4 mm (~13 gauge) in diameter . The Myoscience Iovera¬∞ is a handheld device that uses nitrous oxide as a coolant and can be used with a three-probe configuration with a probe diameter of 0.4 mm (~27 gauge).

In addition to support and structure of the body, bone is the major reservoir for many minerals and compounds essential for maintaining a healthy pH balance. The deterioration of the body with age renders the elderly particularly susceptible to and affected by poor bone health. Illnesses like osteoporosis, characterized by weakening of the bone's structural matrix, increases the risk of hip-fractures and other life-changing secondary symptoms. In 2010, over 258,000 people aged 65 and older were admitted to the hospital for hip fractures. Incidence of hip fractures is expected to rise by 12% in America, with a projected 289,000 admissions in the year 2030. Other sources estimate up to 1.5 million Americans will have an osteoporotic-related fracture each year. The cost of treating these people is also enormous, in 1991 Medicare spent an estimated $2.9 billion for treatment and out-patient care of hip fractures, this number can only be expected to rise. Amino Acid Metabolism When more sulfur containing amino acids, methionine and cystine, are consumed than the body can use for growth and repair, they are broken down yielding sulfate, or sulfuric acid among other products. Animal foods such as meat, dairy, and eggs are high in protein and ‚Äúdietary animal protein intake is highly correlated with renal net acid excretion‚Äù. Research dating back to the early 1900s has shown correlations between high protein diets and increased acid excretion. One measure of the acidic or basic effects foods have in the body is Potential Renal Acid Load (PRAL). Cheeses with protein content of 15 g protein/100g or higher have a high PRAL value of 23.6 mEq/100 g edible portion. Meats, fish, other cheeses and flour or noodles all have a PRAL around 8.0 mEq/100 g edible portion, where fruits and vegetables actually have a negative PRAL. Methionine and Cystine Degradation Pathway In healthy adults, bone is undergoing constant repair and renewal. New bone is deposited by osteoblast cells and resorbed or destroyed by osteoclast cells. This addition and subtraction of bone usually yields no net change in the overall mass of the skeleton, but the turnover process can be significantly affected by pH. =Bone Mineral Density= Bone Mineral Density (BMD) is a measure commonly used to quantify bone health. A lower BMD value indicates an increased risk of an osteoporosis or a fracture. There is a large range of factors influencing BMD. Protein consumption has shown to be beneficial for bone density by providing amino acid substrates necessary for bone matrix formation. It is also thought that blood concentration of the bone formation stimulant, Insulin-like Growth Factor-I (IGF-I), is increased from high protein consumption and parathyroid hormone (PTH), a bone resorption stimulant, is decreased. Although protein has shown to be beneficial for increasing bone mass, or bone mineral density, there is no significant association between protein intake and fracture incidence. In other words, a low BMD can be predictive of osteoporosis and increased fracture risk, but a higher BMD does not necessarily mean better bone health. High BMD is also correlated with other health issues. For example, a higher BMD has also been associated with increased risk of breast cancer. =Acid- Base Homeostasis= PRAL of Common Foods Most metabolic processes have a specific and narrow range of pH where operation is possible, multiple regulatory systems are in place to maintain homeostasis. Fluctuations away from optimal operating pH can slow or impair reactions and possibly cause damage to cellular structures or proteins. To maintain homeostasis the body may excrete excess acid or base through the urine, via gas exchange in the lungs, or buffer it in the blood. The bicarbonate buffering system of blood plasma effectively holds a steady pH and helps to hold extracellular pH around 7.35. The kidneys are responsible for the majority of acid-base regulation but can excrete urine no lower than a pH of 5. This means that a 330mL can of cola, for example, usually ranging in pH from 2.8 - 3.2, would need to be diluted 100 fold before being excreted. Instead of producing 33L of urine from one can of cola, the body relies on buffer to neutralize the acid. Systemic acidosis can be the result of multiple factors, not just diet. Anaerobic exercise, diabetes, AIDS, aging, menopause, inflammation, infections, tumours, and other wounds and fractures all contribute to acidosis. Blood has an average pH of 7.40 but interstitial fluid can vary. Interstitial pH of the skin, for example, is ~7.1. There is no data available for bone. =Homocysteine= Homocysteine, a non-protein amino acid and analogue to the protein amino acid cystine, has been shown to have negative effects on bone health. Higher homocysteine concentrations are likely a result of folate, vitamin B12 B6 deficiencies. In addition, it was found that homocysteine concentration was significantly affected by physical activity. The stimulation of the skeleton through physical activity promotes positive bone remodelling and decreases levels of homocysteine, independently from nutritional intake. Four methods have been proposed regarding the interaction of homocysteine and bone; increase in osteoclast activity, decrease in osteoblast activity, decrease in bone blood flow, and direct action of homocysteine on bone matrix. Homocysteine inhibits lysyl oxidase which is responsible for post- translational modifications of collagen, a key component to bone structure =Osteoclast Cells= Light micrograph of an osteoclast displaying typical distinguishing characteristics: a large cell with multiple nuclei and a \\"foamy\\" cytosol. Osteoclasts are located on the surface of bones and form resorption pits by excreting H+ to the bone surface removing hydroxyapatite, multiple bone minerals, and organic components: collagen and dentin. The purpose of bone resorption is to release calcium to the blood stream for various life processes. These resorption pits are visible under electron microscopy and distinctive trails are formed from prolonged resorption. Osteoclasts have shown to be ‚Äúabsolutely dependent on extracellular acidification‚Äù. A drop in pH of <0.1 units can cause a 100% increase in osteoclast cell activity, this effect persists with prolonged acidosis with no desensitization, ‚Äúamplifying the effects of modest pH differences‚Äù. Osteoclast cells show little or no activity at pH 7.4 and are most active at pH 6.8 but can be further stimulated by other factors such as parathyroid hormone. =Osteoblast Cells= Osteoblast Cells Osteoblast are responsible for the mineralization and construction of bone matrix. Like osteoclast cells, osteoblast cell activity is directly related to extracellular pH mirroring of osteoclast activity. At pH 7.4, where osteoclasts are inactive, osteoblast are at peak activity. Likewise, at pH 6.9 osteoblast activity is non-existent. The hormone estrogen is also important for osteoblast regulation. In postmenopausal women estrogen levels are decreased which has negative effects on bone remodelling. Homocysteine further exacerbates this problem by reducing estrogen receptor Œ± mRNA transcription. Thus reducing any beneficial effect that estrogen plays on bone remodelling. Bone Balance Acidosis inhibits bone osteoblast matrix mineralization with reciprocal effect on osteoclast activation. The combined responses of these cells to acidosis maximizes the availability of hydroxyl ions in solution that can be used to buffer protons. The utilization of bone to buffer even a small percentage of daily acid production can lead to significant loss of bone mass in the course of a decade. Additionally, as the body ages there is a steady decline in renal function. Metabolic acidosis can become more severe as kidney function weakens, and the body will depend more heavily on bone and blood to maintain acid-base homeostasis. Diet There is no one food or nutrient capable of providing adequate bone health on its own. Instead, a balanced diet sufficient in fruits and vegetables for their vitamins, minerals, and alkalinizing substrates is thought to be most beneficial. High protein diets supply larger amounts of amino acids that could be degraded to acidic compounds. Protein consumption above the Recommended Dietary Allowance is also known to be beneficial to calcium utilization. Overall it is understood that high-protein diets have a net benefit for bone health because changes in IGF-I and PTH concentrations outweigh the negative effects of metabolic acid production. The source of protein, plant or animal, does not matter in terms of acid produced from amino acid metabolism. Any differences in Methionine and Cysteine content is not significant to affect the overall potential renal acid load (PRAL) of the food. In addition to their acid precursor protein content, plants also contain significant amounts of base precursors. Potassium bicarbonate, a basic salt, is produced via the metabolism of other organic potassium salts: citrate, malate, and gluconate, which are substantial in plants. The discrepancy observed in PRAL is accounted for by differences in base precursor content.

Her death caused controversy at Duquesne and prompted conversations about unions and the role of adjunct faculty at American universities. Early life and education Margaret Mary Paula Vojtko was born on January 15, 1930 to Catholic Slovak parents. She had five older siblings. Her father worked at Homestead Steel Works, a large steel mill once owned by Andrew Carnegie. Her father belonged to a labor union that would later become the United Steelworkers. Her mother died when she was seven, and her older sister Anne helped raise her. Growing up, Margaret spoke mostly Slovak at home. She attended a high school run by the Vincentian Sisters of Charity and became a secretary at the University of Pittsburgh after graduation; at the time, she wanted to be a nun, although she later abandoned this plan. She remained a traditionalist Catholic throughout her life, however, and opposed the reforms of the Second Vatican Council. After her father's death in 1957, Vojtko attended the University of Pittsburgh, earning a bachelor's degree in 1967 and a master's in 1970. In the mid-1970s, she began working on a doctoral degree from The Catholic University of America. She never completed her dissertation, which focused on the history of Homestead. She received a nursing degree in 1987. Career Vojtko taught courses in French and medieval literature at Carnegie Mellon University and Indiana University ‚Äì Purdue University Fort Wayne before being hired at Duquesne in 1988. She taught at Duquesne for 25 years as an adjunct faculty member. She voted with a majority of other liberal-arts adjunct faculty members to unionize under the purview of the United Steelworkers, who had also represented her father. Duquesne has not recognized the adjunct faculty members' union, arguing that the university's religious nature exempts it from the oversight of the National Labor Relations Board. On April 2, 2013, Vojtko learned her teaching contract would not be renewed; she was instead offered a tutoring job that would have paid two thirds of what she made as an adjunct faculty member. Daniel Kovalik, an attorney for the United Steelworkers, was assisting Vojtko with a complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that the university had not rehired her because of her age or disability. In addition to her work as an academic, Vojtko did translation work on a freelance basis, including in Slovak. She spoke five languages besides English, having majored in French and Italian as an undergraduate and having gained familiarity with German and Latin. Death On August 16, 2013, Vojtko suffered a large heart attack; she died two weeks later, on September 1, aged 83. She had previously been receiving treatment for cancer, and a reaction to pills she had been prescribed had caused her to have an earlier heart attack the previous year. =Controversy= At the time of her death, she had recently become unemployed after Duquesne declined to extend her contract. Particular attention has been paid to the university's labor practices following her death. She was removed from campus by police and dismissed from her work after sleeping in her university office; she was unable to heat her home due to medical bills incurred through taking chemotherapy to treat her ovarian cancer; lack of pension benefits had forced her to continue working until the age of 83 on a full or nearly full-time basis.Notice of death of Margaret Mary Vojtko, post-gazette.com; accessed December 30, 2013. Vice President for University Advancement John Plante described reports that the university did nothing to help Ms. Vojtko as 'reckless' and 'mischaracterizations': \\"Our defense is the truth. Mr. Kovalik has tried to frame this as an issue of human resources policy, but he is wrong...The support provided and offered to Margaret Mary Vojtko was broad, involving the Spiritan community, student housing, EAP, campus police, facilities management, and her faculty and staff colleagues.\\" Rev. Daniel Walsh, a university chaplain, described reports of Vojtko's death as attempts to promote an 'alternative agenda' and said that she was provided with emergency housing on campus for a few weeks. =Reaction= Kansas State University English professor Philip Nel was among those who faulted Duquesne for treating Vojtko unfairly, suggesting that the university's not providing her with health insurance contributed to her death. Representatives of the university defended their treatment of Vojtko, indicating that she had refused repeated offers of assistance from members of the university community. For a time, Vojtko lived in Laval House, a campus residence for priests. Her funeral mass was held at Epiphany Church in Pittsburgh.

Hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system can manifest as increased heart rate, increased respiration, increased blood pressure, diaphoresis, and hyperthermia. Previously, this syndrome has been identified as general dysautonomia but now is considered a specific form of it. It has also been referred to as paroxysmal sympathetic instability with dystonia, or PAID, and sympathetic storm. Recently, however, studies have adopted the name paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity to ensure specificity. PSH is observed more in younger patients than older ones. It is also seen more commonly in men than women. There is no known reason why this is the case, although it is suspected pathophysiological links may exist. In patients surviving traumatic brain injury, the occurrence of these episodes is one in every three. PSH can also be associated with severe anoxia, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage, and hydrocephalus.  Signs and symptoms  Characteristics of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity include: *fever *tachycardia *hypertension *tachypnea *hyperhidrosis or diaphoresis *dystonic posturing *pupillary dilation *flushing In cases where PSH episodes develop post-injury, specifically traumatic brain injury, symptoms typically develop quickly, usually within a week. Symptom onset has been seen to average 5.9 days post-injury. Episodes vary in duration and occurrence. Episodes can last as little as a few minutes or as long as ten hours, and they can occur multiple times a day. Episode duration has been seen to average 30.8 minutes and occur five to six times a day. Episodes can occur naturally or arise from external triggers. Common triggers include pain or stimulation, body turning or movements, and bladder distention. Bladder distention has been observed in patients being treated in intensive care units with the concurrent use of catheters. Symptoms of PSH can last from weeks to years following initial onset. As episodes persist over time, they have been found to become less frequent in occurrence but last for prolonged periods.  Causes  The number of events that can lead to the development of PSH symptoms is many. The exact pathways or causes for the development of the syndrome are not known. Traumatic brain injury, hypoxia, stroke, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (although further associations are being explored), injury of the spinal cord, and many other forms of brain injury can cause onset of PSH. Even more obscure diseases such as intracranial tuberculoma have been seen to cause onset of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity. It is observed that these injuries lead to the development of PSH or are seen in conjunction with PSH, but the pathophysiology behind these diseases and the syndrome is not well understood. Pathophysiology A considerable number of theories exist as to the pathophysiology: *Epileptiform discharges in the diencephalon, or the interbrain, are a potential theory for PSH. These discharges can be identified using electroencephalography. *Increased intracranial pressure is another theory. Currently, this theory seems to be less likely than the others. Intracranial pressure has been seen to have no correlation to PSH episodes. *Disconnection via lesions of the inhibitory efferent pathways from cortical and subcortical areas of the brain is a potential theory. This theory deals with inhibitory pathways being ablated or malfunctioning post-injury. This leads to sympathetic pathways from the cortical and subcortical areas being less controlled, resulting in a 'sympathetic storm'. *Excitatory-inhibitory models suggest that lesions in the mesencephalic area lessen inhibition pathways from the brain. This is thought to lead to pathways that are usually non-nociceptive becoming nociceptive, which results in the peripheral sympathetic nervous system being over activated. *Another theory deals with malfunction of the brainstem, specifically excitatory centers in the brainstem. In this case, rather than inhibitory pathways malfunctioning and allowing sympathetic pathways to propagate unhindered, excitatory centers are up-regulated, increasing sympathetic activity. There are many theories dealing with the pathophysiology of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity. It is possible that none or multiple of these theories are correct. Research that is being conducted on PSH is focused on figuring out these pathways.  Diagnosis  Diagnosing PSH can be very difficult due to the lack of common terminology in circulation and a lack of diagnostic criteria. Different systems for diagnosis have been proposed, but a universal system has not been embraced. One example of a proposed system of diagnosis requires observation confirmation for four of the six following symptoms: fever greater than 38.3 degrees Celsius, tachycardia classified as a heart rate of 120 bpm or higher, hypertension classified as a systolic pressure higher than 160 mmHg or a pulse pressure higher than 80 mmHg, tachypnea classified as respiration rate higher than 30 breaths per minute, excess sweating, and severe dystonia. Ruling out other diseases or syndromes that show similar symptoms is imperative to diagnosis as well. Sepsis, encephalitis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, lethal catatonia, spinal cord injury (not associated with PSH), seizures, and hydrocephalus (this can be associated with PSH) are examples of diagnoses that should be considered due to the manifestation of similar symptoms before confirming a diagnosis of PSH. PSH has no simple radiological features that can be observed or detected on a scan.  Treatment  Various methods are used to treat PSH. Medications are used to end episodes or prevent their occurrence. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been explored as well. Other treatments have been used, but their success is measured on a case-by-case basis. Successful treatments with qualitative results or efficacy for wider ranges of patients have not been developed. = Medication = The two most common medications used in the treatment of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity are morphine sulfate and beta-blockers. Morphine is useful in helping halt episodes that have started to occur. Beta-blockers are helpful in preventing the occurrence of 'sympathetic storms'. Other drugs that have been used and have in some cases been helpful are dopamine agonists, other various opiates, benzodiazepines, clonidine, and baclofen. Chlorpromazine and haloperidol, both dopamine antagonists, in some cases have worsened PSH symptoms. These drugs are in use currently for treatment; exact pathways are not known and wide-range helpfulness is speculative. Morphine Morphine has been found to be effective in aborting episodes; sometimes it is the only medication that can combat the sympathetic response. Morphine helps lower respiration rates and hypertension. It is given in doses of two milligrams to eight milligrams but can be administered up to twenty milligrams. Nausea and vomiting are common side effects. Withdrawal is sometimes seen in patients. Beta-blockers Non-selective beta-blockers are the most effective in reducing the frequency and severity of PSH episodes. They help decrease the effect of circulating catecholamines and lower metabolic rates, which are high in patients during PSH episodes. Beta-blockers also help in reducing fever, diaphoresis, and in some cases dystonia. Propanolol is a common beta-blocker administered due to the fact that it penetrates the blood-brain barrier relatively well. Typically it is administered in doses of twenty milligrams to sixty milligrams every four to six hours in the treatment of PSH. Others Clonidine is an alpha receptor agonist that helps reduces sympathetic activity leaving the hypothalamus and reduces circulating catecholamines. It is helpful in lowering blood pressure and heart rate, but it does not show much of an effect on other symptoms. It may also increase sympathetic inhibition in the brainstem. Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that helps lower blood pressure. Its effects are modest, but they are not well understood. Baclofen is a GABA agonist that helps control muscle spasms, proving to be helpful in treating dystonia. Benzodiazepines bind to GABA receptors and work as muscle relaxants. Benzodiazepines also combat high blood pressure and respiratory rates; however, they are associated with glaucoma, which is a rather serious side effect. Gabapentin inhibits neurotransmitter release in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and various areas of the central nervous system. It helps treat mild symptoms and can be tolerated for longer periods of time compared to other drug treatments. Dantrolene helps combat dystonia and fever by affecting muscle contraction and relaxation cycles. It hinders the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, inhibiting muscle contraction. It causes decreases in respiration, but it can be very dangerous for the liver. Again, these treatments are seen case by case and treat symptoms well. They do not treat the syndrome as a whole or preventatively. Efficacy varies patient to patient, as symptoms do.  Prognosis  Patients who develop PSH after traumatic injury have longer hospitalization and longer durations in intensive care in cases where ICU treatment is necessary. Patients often are more vulnerable to infections and spend longer times on ventilators, which can lead to an increased risk of various lung diseases. PSH does not affect mortality rate, but it increases the amount of time it takes a patient to recover from injury, compared to patients with similar injuries who do not develop PSH episodes. It often takes patients who develop PSH longer to reach similar levels of the brain activity seen in patients who do not develop PSH, although PSH patients do eventually reach these same levels.  History  The first published case of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity was Wilder Penfield's case report of a 41-year-old woman, JH, published in 1929. She had a third ventricle cholesteatoma. She displayed increased respiration, increased heart rate, diaphoresis, and increased blood pressure. She also displayed minor symptoms: pupillary dilation, hiccups, and lacrimation. At the time, her episodes were termed 'diencephalic autonomic epilepsy'. It was believed that both her sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems were showing overactivity. The future may hold non-pharmacologic solutions such as renal sympathetic denervation.Renal Sympathetic Denervation, From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia12/7/2014  References   External links  Peripheral nervous system disorders ","title":"Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity"},{"id":"41121321","text":"The 2010 FIFA World Cup CONCACAF‚ÄìCONMEBOL qualification play-off were a series of two-legged home-and-away ties between the fourth-placed team of the CONCACAF qualifying tournament, Costa Rica, and the fifth-placed team from the South American qualifying tournament, Uruguay.

It served as the terminus station of the private Holmestrand‚ÄìVittingfoss Line (HVB), which was in use between 1902 and 1937. The station was connected to the Norwegian State Railways' (NSB) Holmestrand Station on the Vestfold Line. History The town's first station opened in 1881 and serving the Vestfold Line, was operated by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). With the planning of a private railway to Hvittingfoss during the last years of the 1890s, there arose a controversy over the location of a new station in Holmestrand. As both single parcels and whole wagon-loads would be transshipped between HVB and NSB, the two railway lines would necessarily have to be connected. Five proposals for lines were made, which would either give a common station for both railways in Holmestrand, or two separate stations. Two of the alternatives called for a common station, with the tracks either running via Gausen or the docks. A separate station was proposed either at the town square, with the connection line being built via Gausen or the docks. Alternatively, the station could be built at Gausen.Jakobsen (1993): 24 Holmestrand Municipal Council voted on 20 November 1900 in favor of a station at the square with a connection over Gausen, estimated to cost NOK 43,000, including the connection line. Because this avoided running via the docks, this gave the lowest cost. Other alternatives cost as much as NOK 154,000. However, NSB's district chief stated on 18 May 1901 that the state railways were opposed to this alternative because the link would have a negative influence on operations at Holmestrand Station. After negotiations the two companies reached an agreement, with permission given on 26 August 1902. The station cost NOK 27,300. The largest amount was for the depot, which cost NOK 5,000. Other major posts were NOK 3,000 for the freight house and NOK 2,000 each for the station building and wagon shed. Signaling systems and inventory cost NOK 2,000.Jakobsen (1993): 31 HVB was officially opened on 2 October 1902.Jakobsen (1993): 13 The shed at Gausen quickly proved to be too small and was expanded in 1906 with additional space for rolling stock and a carpenter's workshop, costing NOK 1153.65. It was expanded further the following year for NOK 322.60. The final expansion took place in 1910, when a shed for storing and drying wood was built.Jakobsen (1993): 32 At first the station only had three tracks, increasing to four in 1907, costing NOK 347.46. That year the station handled 68 tonnes of express cargo and 8,884 tonnes of regular cargo, in addition to 24 live animals. Later the station also received two additional spurs which each had a small turnstiles. On 23 October 1910 the docks at Holmestrand Station collapsed, taking with it large amounts of lumber and a warehouse. Fifty men were immediately dispatched from Vittingfoss Bruk to clean up and build new docks. The accident had been caused by 1,600 tonnes of pulp, which was more than the docks were capable of carrying. During the night of 1 November a storm hit Holmestrand, washing away some of the dockside permanent way, leaving only the tracks hanging in the air. By 3 November all but three tonnes of pulp had been salvaged.Jakobsen (1993): 53 The original connection with the Vestfold Line gave operating difficulties for NSB, resulting in the line over Gausen being replaced by a new line over Traneberghaugen, which opened on 21 December 1910. The new double track line cost NOK 200,000, financed by a loan provided by Holmestrand Municipality. In 1910 the station handled 11,630 tonnes of freight and 13,705 of milk, most of which was sent to Viking Melk. The station handled 17,205 passengers, of which 800 traveled on second class and the rest on third, giving the station a revenue of NOK 134,198. Through the next few years a new stone platform was built at the station building and the coal shed expanded. The station building was expanded in 1917 and four years later it received a renovation with new interior and electrical lighting. The station had 23,645 passengers, 191 tonnes of express cargo and 4,393 tonnes of regular cargo in 1921. The docks collapsed again on 17 February 1925, this time simply by sinking under the massive load of wood. The docks, measuring , had not handled the 3,000 tonnes per square meter load. A new, enforced dock was built during the summer. HVB merged with the T√∏nsberg‚ÄìEidsfoss Line on 23 August 1934 through the creation of a new railway company, Vestfold Privatbaner.Jakobsen (1993): 165 The move was met with disregard in Holmestrand, as the new company selected T√∏nsberg for its head office. Vestfold Privatbaner had a troubled economy, as Vittingfoss Bruk repeatedly shut down production.Jakobsen (1993): 167 The railway company's director thus in 1936 started the process of closing the segment from Hillestad to Holmestrand, and from 1936 only irregular trains ran on the segment.Jakobsen (1993): 168 Facilities The station was located at the town square in Holmestrand. It was located from Gausen and from Reversen Station, the next along the line. The station was from Hvittingfoss Station. Holmestrand Station was located above mean sea level.Bjerke (1994): 229 Holmestrand was the main depot of HVB and included a series of operations buildings in addition to the company's administration. It consisted of a station building, a freight building, an outhouse, a locomotive depot, a wagon shed, a coal shed, a turntable and a guardhouse. The station had five tracks, of which three were spurs. Two of these connected to small turnstiles, which were only large enough to handle freight cars. North of the station the line connected to the Vestfold Line at Holmestrand Station. At Gausen there was en engine shed with two tracks. There were gradually built branch lines to major industrial facilities in town, such as the power company Holmestrand Elektrisitetsverk, Nordisk Aluminium and the fish market.

In 1896, two 4-6-2 Pacific type tank locomotives entered service on the Metropolitan and Suburban Railway, which operated a suburban passenger service between Cape Town and Sea Point. In 1901, both locomotives were sold to the Mashonaland Railway.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1944). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter II - The Cape Government Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, April 1944. pp. 253-257. Metropolitan & Suburban Railway In 1887, the Green and Seapoint Company began the construction of the Sea Point Line, a railway line from Cape Town to Sea Point, with the aim to provide a suburban train service to the expanding urban area along the coast behind Signal Hill and Lion's Head. A line of just over long was constructed before the company ran into financial difficulty and abandoned the project. A second enterprise, the Cape Town and Suburban Railway Company, took over the track with plans to extend it, but it failed to have trains running by the 1888 deadline stipulated by the Cape Government and so also went out of business.The South African Railways - Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, p. 24. A third company, the Metropolitan and Suburban Railway Company, was formed to carry on with the line and it was finally opened to public traffic in September 1892. The first locomotives were a pair of 1875 1st Class engines, numbers 3 and 4, which were acquired from the Cape Government Railways. These were used during construction and, once the line was opened, also in revenue service. Manufacturer Two 4-6-2 Pacific type tank locomotives, built by John Fowler and Company with works numbers 7450 and 7451, were delivered to the Metropolitan and Suburban Railway Company in 1896, at a purchase price of ¬£2,167 6s 1d each. The locomotives were named Seapoint and Greenpoint respectively. Service =Sea Point Line= The engines Seapoint and Greenpoint were placed in service in 1896, but they derailed regularly since the curves in the tracks leading up from the Table Bay Harbour dock area to Green Point Common proved to be too sharp for their coupled-and-trailing wheelbase. They were therefore soon withdrawn from service and staged, awaiting sale. The railway itself faced stiff competition from the newly introduced tram service and went out of business in 1898, after a train collision which resulted in serious injury to a solicitor. The matter ended in litigation, with a judgment against the railway for ¬£3,000 in damages. The Sea Point line was resuscitated by the Cape Government Railways in 1905 and, in 1927, was even electrified by the South African Railways at considerable expense, but it was never profitable and was finally closed in 1929. =Mashonaland Railway= The two locomotives were purchased by the Mashonaland Railway in 1901. The engine Seapoint became Mashonaland no. 5 and was renamed Inyanga, while the engine Greenpoint became no. 6 and was renamed Paulington.

(formerly DigitalRights) is a Los Angeles-based copyright enforcement company which locates alleged copyright violators and collects money from legal damages and out of court settlements on behalf of the copyright holder. Rightscorp manages copyrights of videos, music, and video games. Services =Clients= Rightscorp represents music, movie and print publishers. In May 2014, Rightscorp reached 1.5 million copyrights being managed, including those held by Warner Bros. The company manages copyrights for over 800 feature films, including 14 movie titles with gross sales over $3.5 billion. Rightscorp works with music interests such as BMG Rights Management, which represents such musicians as David Bowie, Kings of Leon, and Will.i.am and is a member of the American Association of Independent Music The company represents more than 13,000 copyrights held by Blue Pie Productions and metal/hardcore label Rotten Records. During the week of 24 February 2013, the company was also monitoring 13 songs on the Billboard Hot 100. =Monitoring= Rightcorp utilizes crawlers, which according to Steele and CEO Christopher Sabec, crawls Bittorrent file-sharing sites and finds seeders and their IP addresses over time. Though the company has the seeders‚Äô IP addresses, it requires the ISPs to connect their notices to the seeders. Sabec also says the company can discriminate between actual piracy and unauthorized internet access, but there is no evidence to substantiate this claim. In response to mobile streaming apps such as Meerkat, Periscope and Popcorn Time, the company has also announced a \\"Streaming Rights Monitoring\\" service in May 2015, which the Rightscorp claims will be able to continuously monitor for streaming of copyrighted material on mobile streaming networks. =Notice forwarding= After determining the target IP address, Rightscorp requests that the Internet service provider for that address forward a notice of infringement to the user. The subscribers of more than American 70 ISPs have paid settlements to the company, including Charter Communications, CenturyLink and others. Rightscorp COO Robert Steele told Ars Technica that more ISPs are forwarding their notices each month. According to the company, over 200 ISPs are participating with Rightscorp as of November 2014. However, ISPs do not always choose to comply with the request to forward notices. As of November 2014, music publishers BMG and Round Hill are suing Cox Communications for not terminating the accounts of users identified by Rightscorp as being allegedly repeat downloaders. In May 2015, Rightscorp filed suit against two Comcast users for downloading two albums, including Acid Bath's When the Kite String Pops and D.R.I.'s Definition. The company claims one of the downloaders ignored 11 notices, the other, 288. Rotten Records, through Rightscorp, is demanding an injunction against further infringement, deletion of the files and a fine of $150,000 per work. =Settlements and disconnections= In the notice of infringement, the Rightscorp offers a choice between paying a small settlement fee (around $10 to $20 USD per violation) or facing a possible lawsuit for damages of around $150,000 USD under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the current law. After collection, Rightscorp‚Äôs settlements are split 50/50 with its clients. The company compares its settlement option of $20 per alleged infringement to a traffic ticket, calling it a \\"socially fair way to create a deterrent.\\" Even though the notice works as a settlement offer, the notice is not in itself enforceable by law and the liability of the infringed offender has to be determined by a civil court. If the user chooses not to pay and is repeatedly alleged of violated copyright infringements, the ISP may suspend or terminate the subscriber account until a settlement is reached. TorrentFreak claimed in 2011 that more than 200,000 Bittorrent users were in some stage of a lawsuit for alleged copyright infringement. The company also announced that it has closed more than 75,000 cases of online copyright infringement. Lawsuits =Class Action Lawsuit= On November 21, 2014 Morgan Pietz of The Pietz Law Firm, together with Drew Pomerance of Roxborough, Pomerance, Nye & Adreani filed a Class Action Lawsuit against Rightscorp Inc, various John Does, and its owners, Christopher Sabec, Robert Steele, and outside legal counsel, Craig Harmon. The complaint seeks class certification against Rightscorp for violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, California‚Äôs Rosenthal Act, and Abuse of process for the willful misuse of subpoena power by issuing special DMCA subpoenas, under 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512(h). Mr. Pietz's original plaintiff withdrew from the case. After locating replacement plaintiffs, he refiled the suit, but dropped half of the claims originally contained in it. Subsequently, one of Mr Pietz's two surviving claims was stricken by the Court, and in the process, legal fees were awarded against Mr Pietz's client. At approximately the same time, over Mr Pietz's objections, the Court dismissed Mr Harmon (whom Mr Pietz had incorrectly identified as an employee or officer of Rightscorp) from the case. On May 12, 2015, a federal court ordered John Blaha, represented by Pietz, to pay attorney‚Äôs fees in John Blaha v. Rightscorp. Pietz filed the lawsuit as a class action; he asserted Rightscorp, on behalf of Warner Bros and BMG Rights Management, abused the judicial system by issuing 142 DMCA subpoenas. Rightscorp countered that suing on those grounds were a violation of the first amendment and subject to California‚Äôs anti-SLAPP laws. The judge sided with Rightscorp (though it still faces an allegation that it violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act by making automated calls in to demand settlements.) =Telephone Consumer Protection Act Lawsuit= On February 17, 2015 Plaintiffs Melissa Brown and Ben Jenkins represented by Attorney Sergei Lemberg of Lemberg Law LLC filed a Lawsuit against Rightscorp Inc and its Clients named as John Does 1-10 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia for Telephone Consumer Protection Act abuses and other violations. Brown and Jenkins claim that Rightscorp Inc and its Clients violated America‚Äôs Telephone Consumer Protection Act by sending automated calls and text messages in their general direction without permission. Evidence shows that Jenkins sent Rightscorp Inc numerous emails instructing Rightscorp Inc to cease their calls, text messages, emails and letter solicitations to him and Brown. Regardless, Rightscorp Inc continued to place calls and text messages to the Plaintiffs‚Äô cellular and home phones. Brown and Jenkins are seeking damages for each alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. =BMG Rights Management vs. Cox Communications= On behalf of BMG Rights Management, Rightscorp won a ruling in a jury trial against Cox on December 17, 2015 for $25 million. US District Judge Liam O'Grady, found that Cox failed to \\"reasonably implement\\" a method to terminate repeated infringers and that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's \\"safe harbor\\" provision did not apply. In addition, Lloyd's of London took legal action to remove their liability obligations to Cox, based on, according their filings, negligence and disregard for copyright infringement violations. The total amount Cox could be liable for, with Lloyd's underwriting, is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars. Finances In October 2013 the company went public, trading on the OTCQB under the ticker RIHT. In May 2014 the company announced that it is expanding into Canada and was in Europe investigating expansion in Europe. On November 14, 2014 Rightscorp filed a Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting its Q3 2014 earnings. The company reported a total loss of $2.2 million for the first three quarters of 2014 along with a total loss of $6.5 million since 2011. In 2015, Rightscorp had a net loss of $3.5 million and in the first three months of 2016 it had a net loss of $784,000. Rightscorp Revenues Collapse, Pirates Too Hard to Track TorrentFreak, May 17, 2016 Security Breach Security issues with Rightscorp's online payment system surfaced in October 2014. Due to security gaps with hidden form elements, a Secure Sockets Layer Certificate, and Rightscorp permitting search engine indexing of secure pages; names and address of alleged infringers were publicly exposed including individuals that settled cases with Warner Bros and Miramax Films. Criticism Issues have been raised with regard to Rightscorp's practices. Several court cases have ruled that Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) subpoenas do not require internet service providers (ISPs) to identify their users to the issuer of the subpoena; indeed, an ISP that does provide that information can face sanctions, as can the issuer of the subpoena. The notice sent by Rightscorp prevents a lawsuit for the specific download in the notice; however, because of the language in the notice, paying the settlement is an admission of guilt. Although Rightscorp is then unable to sue for that infringement, not only can they sue and press charges for subsequent downloads, but they have the original settlement as admission of guilt of previous infringement. Comcast, the largest internet provider in the United States, has continually refused to forward Rightscorp's DMCA settlement notices in the form in which Rightscorp sends them. Comcast removes the threatening language and the settlement offer and instead simply forwards a letter to their customer that basically reads as an incident report.

Researchers use a variety of models for this process, with different models able to replicate certain aspects of TBI while also producing their own limitations. An estimated 1.7 million cases of TBI occur per year, not taking into account the lasting affects that TBI may cause. TBI is also reported as a contributing factor in about 30% of all injury related death. Given how prevalent TBI is, preventing or minimizing its effects would benefit many people worldwide. Models bring advantages and disadvantages to TBI research. They are good at representing one observable aspect but must ignore other aspects. For example, a researcher may study blunt impacts with a neuronal cell culture model that is the depth of the cortical layer. The researcher subjects this to different impact sizes, shapes, and forces to see how cells react and what cytokines they release. This model works well for the cortical layer, but ignores deeper cell layers due to the inability to oxygenate a deeper cell culture effectively. In this experiment, the disadvantage and limitation of this model is cell depth. It gathers accurate information within the cortical layer, but ignores interactions that might occur below the cortical layer. Damage on a cellular level TBI occurs when neurons in the brain experience stresses and strains that exceed their threshold for elastic deformation. Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI) has been found to occur when strain exceeds 10%, and strain rates exceed 10 meters per second. Once this threshold is passed, cells begin to die due to apoptosis, or simply from the rupturing of cell membranes. The death of neurons is compounded by the fact that neurons do not undergo mitosis unless very specific conditions are met; not only are the cells removed, but they are also not replaced by new neurons. This, in turn, means that a person experiencing multiple TBIs in a similar area suffers the culmination of all previous injuries, possibly up to four times the initial damage. In addition to the physical stresses and strains that neurons experience during TBI, cell-cell interactions also contribute to the damage, primarily due to the formation of a glial scar. Neurons release cytokines during TBI that have a variety of effects, including summoning astrocytes to the afflicted area. Once they arrive, the astrocytes begin to generate more cytoskeletal structures until the damaged region is completely sealed. While this does create chemical and physical stability in the area, this scarring prevents any self-healing processes from occurring. These processes are part of the natural damage response mechanisms, which also include the brain experiencing a pro-inflammatory response at the location of damage that is regulated by an anti-inflammatory response that is farther away from the damaged area. In addition to this response, there is also a general haemodynamic response function that follows TBI. Common Types of TBI =Blast-induced= Blast-Induced TBI results from wave propagation from a blast source through the brain. These injuries are most commonly found on the battlefield, as explosions occur close enough to humans that the high intensity waves apply stresses and strains that greatly surpass neuron elastic thresholds. As the wave passes through the skull, cerebrospinal fluid, and through the brain, neurons undergo sequences of tension and compression for the duration of the blast wave. Even very short blast waves with high intensity can cause immediate cell death, even through the cerebrospinal fluid buffer. Blast-Induced damage is not localized to a specific region due to its wave nature, and can penetrate deep into the brain before finally subsiding, depending on the blast intensity and proximity. =Impact-induced= Impact damage is the most common type of TBI, estimated at 75% of all TBI injuries, and results from the brain making physical contact with the skull. Impact- induced TBI is localized to the region of impact, although the depth varies by person and force of impact. While cerebrospinal fluid normally acts as a buffer between the brain and skull, during moments of extreme force (i.e. car collision or physical contact sports), this barrier can be overcome, resulting in an impact as the brain rams into the skull. During the moment of impact, some neurons die immediately from being crushed, while other neurons may be damaged to varying degrees and undergo apoptosis. Concussions are the most common and least damaging form of impact-induced TBI. Types of TBI models =in vitro= in vitro models are the most versatile method, because they facilitate analyzing any aspect of TBI, as long as a model is created to do so. in vitro models are useful for measuring forces among neurons, as there is much more freedom of space and time to measure the forces, as opposed to trying to fit the sensors in the brain itself. Using in vitro models alone, however, does not produce a complete understanding of all TBI mechanisms, due to the specialization of each model. As the model becomes more specialized, general overarching effects that may be present in the live model are removed. Many experiments have been conducted in attempts to create a general model for the mechanical tolerance of neurons within the Central Nervous System (CNS). One such in vitro model has found that CNS neurons have a lower threshold for stress and strain loads than Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) neurons. =in vivo= in vivo models are the opposite end of the spectrum. These models sacrifice specialization to observe brain reactions in the context of the whole body. While this gives a better understanding of the reactions to TBI as a whole, in vivo models have many effects that are not solely due to the injury. These effects may a misattribution of the observed events to the injury, while in truth they are unrelated. To sort out irrelevant effects, in vitro models mimic what was found with the in vivo model. Running these iterations helps find true causes and effects of TBI, which in turn helps future research mitigate these causes and effects. in vivo TBI models tend to use rats or mice, as they offer easy access to a living brain that can be analyzed. =Mathematical= Mathematical models differ greatly from in vivo and in vitro models, as cells are not usually required. Instead, a mathematical model or method for analysis is chosen and then solved with given information. A basic model is a simple differential equation that would be solved according to the initial or boundary conditions that are present in the model. For example, knowing that DAI occurs when strain exceeds 10% and strain rates exceed 10 meters per second helps researchers calculate projected damage to the brain using a finite element model. This basic model, however, would give such an estimate so rough that it would most likely prove useless unless it modeled a very general event. As more factors are considered, a mathematical model becomes increasingly difficult to solve. To simplify this, researchers make assumptions and approximations that, while making the model easier to solve, also lose a little validity due to the simplified terms (similar to in vivo and in vitro models). The assumptions, approximations, and corresponding losses vary according to the model. An example of a mathematical modeling is using the finite element method and solving the model using a coupled Lagrangian‚ÄìEulerian method. Mathematical models are usually not created for a specific analysis. This means that these models are usually adapted variations applied to a specific event, resulting in the model itself having limitations with respect to the event being analyzed (before losses due to assumptions are considered). While this may be acceptable for certain analyses, more specific events may require the creation of a new mathematical model. Difficulties and limitations of TBI modeling The brain is the most complex and least understood organ in the body, resulting in modeling the brain as a whole virtually impossible with current technology. To compensate for this complexity, models for the brain must be explicitly defined as to what exactly they model. Doing this inevitably results in many well defined models for different parts of the brain. However, they are all taken out of context of the 'whole brain', meaning that brain models do not incorporate aspects such as spatial and depth characteristics that a whole brain would have to prevent damage. Future applications While modeling itself only gives estimations, research based on these estimations could give rise to amazing technology. For example, a human head and combat helmet were modeled under blast waves, and the results showed that the helmet did very little to stop blast-induced damage. With this information, a new type of combat helmet could be created that minimizes the damage that blast waves can cause. This technology could then also be applied to general armor, or even clothing (blast waves damage internal organs as well). This kind of advancement is only the beginning of TBI reduction. Methods such as genetic manipulation may also become available. These could increase the stress and strain thresholds for neurons, or perhaps present modeling will lead to methods for healing the brain altogether. Nanotechnology may have a large future impact on TBI. The extremely small size and high variance of nanoparticles create countless possibilities for the future of not only TBI, but science in general. For instance, nanoparticles or nanomachines that stay in the brain could create tropic factors, which aid in guiding neurons, and trophic factors, which give the neuron nutrients needed to survive and grow. If this could occur as soon as the damage happens, TBI would be reduced by a large amount. Unfortunately, nanotechnology, and specifically nanomedicine, are very new fields of study. Many nanoparticles exhibit toxic effects throughout the body due to their size and reactivity. These effects would only be amplified in the vulnerable neurons within the brain, causing more damage than they repair.

Early years Born in Ballintry, Antrim County, Ireland (near Belfast), in 1830, Eddings immigrated to the United States with his parents in 1841. They lived in New York initially, then moved to St. Louis, Missouri. John Eddings enlisted on July 17, 1851 in the U.S. Army Infantry, Fourth Regiment, at Fort Gratiot, Michigan. As a first sergeant he came with that regiment to Vancouver Barracks by way of the Isthmus of Panama in 1851. On that journey were also Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Bonneville, Henry C. Hodges, and Louis Sohns From 1855 to 1856, Eddings fought in the Rogue River Wars in Southern Oregon Territory. Mrs. Mary Nicholas, a daughter of John Eddings, gave this account to Clark Brown in his Columbian newspaper column Visiting Around: > I told you my father was a man who loved adventure, and he found plenty in > the Indian wars. My father had fiery red hair. He went to the Rogue River > Indian War and when he came back his hair was snowy white. The scalping, the > dead soldiers, and their lack of equipment was just too much for him. Service in Vancouver Eddings was appointed military storekeeper by Captain Rufus Ingalls (later a General) in 1857. The position of storekeeper for the Fort was one of considerable importance to the Fort. He was responsible for purchases of all goods and armaments, storage management, and maintenance of the facilities at the Fort. Fort Vancouver was the main depot from which troops were supplied to the Northwest region. Eddings served in this position for thirty years. In November, 1865, Eddings was elected to the Vancouver City Council, serving for two years. Near the end of the term, it is indicated that he was appointed to the Committee for Cemetery Improvements, serving with Joseph M. Fletcher and G. W. Durgin, with the committee putting a picket fence around the city cemetery. In September, 1866, a volunteer fire company was organized in Vancouver, its first, and Eddings was among the officers and founders, along with other leaders in the community. There had been a recent fire in downtown Vancouver, which consumed a number of businesses and residences, due in part to the lack of fire services in the city. On May 11, 1867, the City Council, with Eddings a member, created a Fire Department of the City of Vancouver. In July, 1875, Eddings also took on the job of Postmaster for Vancouver, serving for the next eleven years in addition to his other military and civic duties. Edding‚Äôs daughter, Mrs. Mary Nichols, has provided an insight into living in this period in Vancouver, Washington: > The incoming mail came by carriers. There were no trains at that time. We > knew by the whistle of the steam boat when the mail came by river. It also > came by stage and on horseback carriers. It was a little uncertain just when > it would come. People would come for a long way to get their mail, and > mother always had coffee for the people who came after it, a treat they all > relished. Social and Family On December 20, 1853, a baby girl, Josephine Eddings, was born to John and Sarah Eddings, in one of the original log cabins of Fort Vancouver. While this was not the first baby born in Vancouver, it was the first born in Vancouver within the new United States Territory of Washington. The Washington Territory had been recently created, on March 2, 1853, carved out of what had been the Oregon Territory. There is a popular local story that Josephine‚Äôs name was the result of a vote by the officers of the Fort. They had been following the events of Napoleon's career, and wanted the new baby to be named after the French General's wife. This may be confusing though, as Napoleon I, who was married to Josephine, died in 1821, and it was Napoleon III, his nephew, that was in the news in 1853-1854. But the story remains popular with local historians anyway, including a plaque commemorating this event and story being placed on Officers Row in Vancouver, Washington. John Eddings and his large family were active members of St. Luke's Episcopal Church. Eddings was one of the founders at its consecration in 1860, and served for twelve years in the church leadership, working with two of the church‚Äôs priests, John D. McCarty and Albert S. Nicholson. In 1866 the Vancouver Hibernian Benevolent Society, an Irish social organization, elected John Eddings President for the ensuing year. He remained active in this organization. When Grant came to Vancouver in 1879, the former president visited with both Louis Sohns and John Eddings. When Eddings died on March 31, 1896, his was one of the most highly attended funerals in the history of Vancouver. The 14th Infantry Band led a procession stretching nearly a half mile in addition to a large contingent of carriages with relatives and friends.

More specifically, the root stimulator can be used in patients who have lost proper bowel function due to damaged neurons related to gastrointestinal control and potentially allow paraplegics to exercise otherwise paralyzed leg muscles.  Usage  The lumbar anterior root stimulator is similar in nature to Brindley's sacral anterior root stimulator. The difference in nomenclature is derived from which nerve roots on the spinal cord are being electrically stimulated. However the two types may be used in conjunction and may be referred to as sacro-lumbar root stimulators or lumbo- sacral root stimulators which seem to be the most researched in literature. The stimulators are implanted from the anterior side due to easier access of the spine below the cervical vertebrae. = Bowel control = Loss of bowel control due to severed nerves in the spinal cord is one of the more common reasons for lumbar root stimulator usage. Patients in such a condition often suffer from gastrointestinal issues such as incontinence, diarrhea, or an inability to completely evacuate the urinary tract. This is in turn puts the patient at further risk for more complications such as a urinary tract infection. Giles Brindley initially developed for paraplegic patients with diminished or no bladder control as severed neurons affected both the gastrointestinal system and the mobility of the lower limbs. Root stimulators are mounted onto the anterior roots of the spinal cord and electrically stimulate the neurons allowing them to propagate signals in their respective pathways and thus restore overall gastrointestinal function. Additional studies showed that a rhizotomy may also be performed on patients with the implant to reduce sensory reflexes which may otherwise inhibit the device's function. The procedure has been shown to both improve the device's function and reduce overall patient discomfort since the device is less likely to be rejected by the patient's body. = Treatment of chronic pain = The spine is an important part of pain sensation as many pathways pass from the extremities through the spine into the brain. As such, dysfunctional nerves in the spine can unnecessarily signal pain even when there is no reason for the pain. Some research has been conducted in potentially using the prosthesis to help treat chronic pain related to failed back syndrome or discogenic low back pain as an alternative to stimulating the entire dorsal column. Stimulation of the nerve roots has been shown as a potential alternative for those who suffer chronic pain and either have not had success with conventional spinal cord stimulation or do not qualify for that treatment option. The stimulators are able to focus stimulation on the nerve roots of the spine and hypothetically improve the relief of neuropathic pain signals sent through the spinal cord. The study showed some promise as all subjects indicated some degree of pain relief. While this method may be more effective, it carries with it important risks that must be considered. Direct stimulation of the root risks greater neurological damage due to intra-operative spinal cord injury which in turn would yield further complications. = Muscle stimulation = Donaldson and Perkins theorized the ability to use lumbar root stimulation in conjunction with a multi-moment chair in order to restore control of leg function in paraplegic patients. A multi-moment chair is a device used to record movement data of the leg in different directions. The researchers were able to generate muscle action through the devices and were later able to display leg control in a cycling paraplegic patient. Lumbar root stimulation poses unique advantage over peripheral motor nerves stimulation in terms of accessibility to target effectors. Activation of peripheral motor nerves is limited to small group of muscles and thus stimulation will only result in a considerably more localized response. On the other hand, root stimulation operates at a higher level of muscle control and therefore has wider targeting. The inherent tradeoff is the difficulty of controlling and predicting the response of the targets. The multi-moment chair was used to measure the responsiveness of the muscle across multiple axes to predict how stimulation of the root would affect the quadriceps and create more predictive model to better understand the relationship between lumbar root stimulation and the leg response. An ongoing problem with patients suffering from paralysis was the inability to exercise the muscles causing them to atrophy. Using the previous study, researchers focused on using the sacro-lumbar anterior root stimulator to give patients the ability to cycle. Cycling is non-weight bearing has a simpler motion compared to other forms of low impact exercises such as walking. The stimulators allowed one patient cycle up to 1.2 km in one try and were able to create a \\"fluid cycling gait.\\"  Related issues  = Spinal cord injury = Spinal cord injuries have many causes, and result in a high comorbidity. In other words, victims of spinal cord injuries tend to develop many other health problems due to the importance of the spine in the central nervous system. SCI has a prevalence of up to 55 per million people in the United States alone while approximately 10,000 new cases occur annually. Car crashes are the highest contributor while violence and recreational activities are causes as well. While spinal cord injury is a broad and widely-encompassing term, root stimulators may be used for many instances of SCIs. For example, certain cases of spinal cord injuries may sever key nerves necessary to maintain bladder and bowel control. The severance is often the cause of Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction. Similarly, spinal cord injuries can potentially cause a loss of motor control in lower limbs, such as with paraplegic and tetraplegic patients. Stimulators, in turn, may be used to stimulate the muscle and treat motor control loss in order to regain function in the limbs. = Gastrointestinal issues = As mentioned previously, neurogenic bowel dysfunction tends to occur after some form of spinal cord injury in which nerves important to control of sphincter contraction, bowel movements, and bladder control are severed or damaged. Lumbar root stimulators have been used in order to treat bowel dysfunction by allowing the patient to regain control of both excretory muscles and organs. Regaining such motor control prevents further complications associated with NBD such as constipation, incontinence, and irritable bowel syndrome. However, lumbar anterior root stimulators are not effective for all gastrointestinal issues. In the case of bladder control, contractions are controlled by the parasympathetic efferent pathways of the sacral section of the spine which renders lumbar stimulation ineffective. On the other hand, bladder control is closely associated with parasympathetic pathways on both the sacral and lumbar sections of the spine thus making sacro-lumbar anterior root stimulators a more viable option as it can deal with both sets of issues. = Paraplegia = Paraplegia is a condition in which a person loses the ability to control or perceive his or her lower limbs. Patients that have lost functional limb control due to spinal cord injuries often have further complications past the point of injury. Due to paralysis, paraplegics remain unable to exercise the leg muscles and leads to muscle atrophy. In such cases, lumbar anterior root stimulators may offer a minimal and temporary solution by allowing paraplegics some capacity to exercise the legs. Some research has shown that root stimulators may allow cycling to be feasible to those who suffer from paraplegia as a proof of concept. The devices may show promise in applications of more complex leg movement processes such as walking. At the very least, they offer a potential solution to delaying the issue of atrophy in paraplegics so that they might have an easier recovery in the case that better treatments come along.  Complications  Root stimulators are far from being perfect as there are many potential complications. Approximately 18% of patients with root stimulators have reported issues with the device. Approximately 8% of stimulator reports are due to cerebrospinal fluid collecting around the stimulator which inhibits stimulator function and causes significant discomfort to the patient. Another 8% of cases are caused by receiver failure in which the patient is unable to use the stimulator effectively or is in some way \\"incompatible\\" with the implant. The final 2% is associated with some type of disease that requires removal of the device and puts the patient at great risk. Two major studies have been associated with issues in root stimulators. One twenty-nine-year-old male cervical spinal cord injury patient had severe complications with a sacral anterior root stimulator. The patient received the implant due to a traffic collision in 1978. The patient experienced increased spasms which inhibited daily functions such as sleeping or trying to get into his car. Later on, he suffered delayed lumbar spinal fracture at the site of the implant which required its subsequent retraction. The spasms reduced in intensity when the patient decided to discontinue the use of the sacral anterior root stimulator and instead chose to use an indwelling urethral catheter. The case was cited as \\"compelling evidence for disuse\\" of the device. A more recent study focused on a tetraplegic SCI patient whose stimulator was infected by Pseuomana aeruginosa which was found after blood- stained fluid started leaking out of a post-operative wound several days after the device was implanted. As in the aforementioned case, the patient had the device removed and lost considerable function of bowel and urinary bladder control. He had recurring instances of fecal incontinence which left him almost completely immobile and reported significant distress due to the incident. Other issues due to the failed implantation included constipation, an inability to empty the bladder, and a loss of reflexive penile erection. The case identified the high risk associated with the usage of root stimulators.

The test consists of 4 different 10 page booklets, with a total of 40 questions. On each page, there is a different \\"scratch and sniff\\" strip which are embedded with a microencapsulated odorant. There is also a four choice multiple choice question on each page. The scents are released using a pencil. After each scent is released, the patient smells the level and detects the odor from the four choices. There is an answer column on the back of the test booklet, and the test is scored out of 40 items. The score is compared to scores in a normative database from 4000 normal individuals, this tells the level of absolute smell function. The score also indicates how the patient does in accordance to their age group and gender. The test is occasionally judged to have an American cultural bias. There have been British, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Korean and Spanish UPSIT versions made. There are also the Brief (Cross-Cultural) Smell Identification Test, the Scandinavian Odor Identification Test. Olfactory system Vesalius' Fabrica, 1543. Olfactory Bulbs and Olfactory tracts outlined in red. Through the nose, smell is induced when olfactory receptor cells are stimulated by volatile chemicals. The olfactory receptor cells, otherwise known as the primary olfactory neurons, are in the neuroepithilium. The neuroepithlium is located at the top of the nasal vault, which is at the upper portion of the nasal septum. The information received by the olfactory receptors is transmitted by the olfactory nerves to the olfactory bulb through the cribriform plate. In the olfactory bulb, olfactory nerves make synaptic contact with dendrites of mitral and tufted cells. Efferent neurons of the olfactory bulb become the fibers that form the olfactory tracts, which is directly under the frontal lobes in the brain. The axons from the mitral and tufted cells project this information to many other regions of the brain including the thalamus, hypothalamus and dorsolateral frontal cortex. The Olfactory Nerve The Olfactory System in the brain Plan of olfactory neurons. Crubiform plate The olfactory bulb has been said to be the olfactory thalamus. It performs the final stage of sensory processing before information is sent to the cortex. It has been proven that there is a strong correlation between cognitive function and olfactory function. It has been reported that the ability of detection of odors is not as challenging as the identification of odors. It has been hypothesized that this is due to lack of verbal or visual representations of odors. It has also been speculated that olfactory function and odor detection have a correlation to memory function. It has been shown that olfactory identification is predictive of memory decline. Demographics In general, women have a better sense of smell than men do. This advantage can be observed very early on in childhood, even as early as 4 years of age. This is evidenced by several cultures. This superiority in women also increases with age. Overall, women have a higher functioning olfactory system than men do starting from a young age. With the increase in age, there is an increased loss of the olfactory function. On average, individuals begin to lose function of their olfactory system by the age of 65. Of the individuals who do suffer a loss of olfactory function, half of the losses begin between the ages of 65 and 80. Also three quarters of these occur after the age of 80. This plays a role in diagnosing Alzheimer's. Genetics has been found to play a significant role in the ability of one's olfactory system as well. If an individual does suffer from olfactory dysfunction, it is five times more likely that their first order relatives will also suffer from olfactory dysfunction. Smoking is also a major factor in a decrease of olfactory function. It can take years for past smokers to regain their presmoking olfactory function. Occasionally it is even impossible for individuals to regain this level in its entirety. The length of time it can take for smokers to regain this level depends on the duration and intensity of their smoking habits. The olfactory system can be compromised in several environments. This includes residents of large urban cities. Also, workers in certain industries, for example paper and chemical manufacturing industries. Diagnosis There are many central nervous system disorders that are associated with olfactory dysfunction. Most of these dysfunctions classify as degenerative neuropsychiatric disorders. Some of these diseases are: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Korsakoff's Psychosis, Schizophrenia, Congenital Anosmia, Head Trauma, Brain Tumors, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome(AIDS), and multiple sclerosis. =Alzheimer's= UPSIT has been used to detect Alzheimer's (AD). Smell loss can be a very early sign of detecting AD. It has been suggested that AD affects odor identification and odor detection, this shows that AD patients have more trouble performing higher olfactory tasks that involve specific cognitive processes. During a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, blood oxygen level-dependent was found more strongly in control patients than AD patients, who showed a weaker signal. It has also been found through several studies that olfactory function and cognition correlates to the severity of AD. Therefore, UPSIT is a very good clinical test to be able to determine the severity of AD. During AD, a patient's olfactory bulb, amygdala and temporal cortices are affected. There is also severe nerve cell loss. =Parkinson's Disease= UPSIT is also used to diagnose Parkinson's disease (PD). Smell dysfunction occurs in 90% of cases with PD. After the commercial release of UPSIT, there have been many studies published that have shown olfactory dysfunction in patients with PD. The many studies were undertaken because it was discovered that smell tests can differentiate PD from progressive supranuclear palsy, essential tremor, and parkinsonism induced by MPTP. It has been shown that the olfactory bulb is one of the two main regions where PD seems to begin. In families where there are individuals with PD, UPSIT can be used to predict whether other first degree relatives will also develop PD. It has been discovered that multiple factors contribute to the development of PD-related olfactory dysfunction. As with AD, the UPSIT score can also determine the severity of PD. But people develop various levels of olfactory dysfunction. The disorders with the olfactory dysfunction are those with the most pathology, such as PD and AD.

In other words, it is the process of restoring functional ability and improving quality of life and independence in an individual who has lost visual function through illness or injury.Brandt Jr, E. N., & Pope, A. M. (Eds.). (1997). Enabling America: Assessing the role of rehabilitation science and engineering. National Academies Press.Scheiman, M., Scheiman, M., & Whittaker, S. (2007). Low vision rehabilitation: A practical guide for occupational therapists. SLACK Incorporated. Most visual rehabilitation services are focused on low vision, which is a visual impairment that cannot be fully corrected by regular eyeglasses, contact lenses, medication, or surgery. Low vision interferes with the ability to perform everyday activities. Visual impairment is caused by factors including brain damage, vision loss, and others. Of the vision rehabilitation techniques available, most center on neurological and physical approaches.  Definition  Rehabilitation (literally, the act of making able again) helps patients achieve physical, social, emotional, spiritual independence and quality of life. Rehabilitation does not undo or reverse the cause of damage; it seeks to promote function and independence through adaptation. Individuals can seek rehabilitation in different domains, such as motor rehabilitation after a stroke or physical rehabilitation after a car accident.Ponsford, J., Sloan, S., & Snow, P. (2012). Traumatic brain injury: Rehabilitation for everyday adaptive living. Psychology Press. Low vision can be caused by many diseases.  Clinical studies and treatments  = Neurological approach= There are many treatments and therapies to slow degradation of vision loss or improve the vision using neurological approaches. Studies have found that low vision can be restored to good vision. In some cases, vision cannot be restored to normal levels but progressive visual loss can be stopped through interventions.  Chemical treatments  In general, chemical treatments are designed to slow the process of vision loss. Some research is done with neuroprotective treatment that will slow the progression of vision loss. Despite other approaches existing, neuroprotective treatments seem to be most common among all chemical treatments.  Gene therapy Gene therapy uses DNA as a delivery system to treat visual impairments. In this approach, DNA is modified through a viral vector, and then cells related to vision cease translating faulty proteins.Strachan, T., & Read, A. P. (1999). Gene therapy and other molecular genetic-based therapeutic approaches. Gene therapy seems to be the most prominent field that might be able to restore vision through therapy. However, research indicates gene therapy may worsen symptoms, cause them to last longer or lead to further complications. Gene therapy using an adenovirus vector. = Physical approach= For physical approaches to vision rehabilitation, most of the training is focused on ways to make environments easier to deal with for those with low vision. Occupational therapy is commonly suggested for these patients. Also, there are devices that help patients achieve higher standards of living. These include video magnifiers, peripheral prism glasses, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), closed-circuit television (CCTV), RFID devices, electronic badges with emergency alert systems, virtual sound systems, and smart wheelchairs. CCTV for low vision  Mobility training Mobility training improves the ability for patients with visual impairment to live independently by training patients to become more mobile. For low vision patients, there are multiple mobility training methods and devices available including the 3D sound virtual reality system, talking braille, and RFID floors. The 3D sound virtual reality system transforms sounds into locations and maps the environment. This system alerts patients to avoid possible dangers. The talking braille is a device that helps low vision patients to read braille by detecting light and transmitting this information through Bluetooth technology.Ross, D. A., & Lightman, A.

In Proceedings of the 7th international ACM SIGACCESS conference on Computers and accessibility (pp. 98-105). ACM. RFID floors are GPS-like navigation systems which help patients to detect building interiors, which ultimately allow them to detour around obstacles.Mori, T., Suemasu, Y., Noguchi, H., & Sato, T.

Home skills training Home skills training allows patients to improve communication skills, self-care skills, cognitive skills, socialization skills, vocational training, psychological testing, and education. One study indicates that multicomponent group interventions for older adults with low vision as an effective approach related to home training. The multicomponent group interventions include learning new knowledge or skills each week, having multiple sessions to allow participants to apply learned knowledge or skills in their living environment, and building relationships with their health care providers. The most important factor in this intervention is support from family, which includes assistance with changes in lifestyles, financial concerns, and future planning.

Interfaces to the nervous system usually take the form of electrodes for stimulation and recording, though chemical stimulation and sensing are possible.Grill, W. M., Norman, S. E., & Bellamkonda, R.

Annual review of biomedical engineering, 11, 1‚Äì24. doi:10.1146/annurev- bioeng-061008-124927 Research in this area is focused on developing peripheral nerve interfaces for the restoration of function following disease or injury to minimize associated losses. Peripheral nerve interfaces also enable electrical stimulation and recording of the peripheral nervous system to study the form and function of the peripheral nervous system. Many researchers also focus in the area of neuroprosthesis, linking the human nervous system to bionics in order to mimic natural sensorimotor control and function.Donaldson PEK (1983). The Cooper cable: An Implantable Multiconductor cable for neurological prostheses. Med Biol Eng Comput 21:371-374 Successful implantation of peripheral nerve interfaces depend on a number of factors which include appropriate indication, perioperative testing, differentiated planning, and functional training.Navarro, X., Krueger, T.

Journal of the peripheral nervous system : JPNS, 10(3), 229‚Äì58. doi:10.1111/j.1085-9489.2005.10303.x Typically microelectrode devices are implanted adjacent to, around or within the nerve trunk to establish contact with the peripheral nervous system. Different approaches may be used depending on the type of signal desired and attainable. Function The primary purpose of a neural interface is to enable two-way exchange of information with the nervous system for a sustained period of time to enable effective and high density stimulation and recording. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is responsible for relaying information from the brain and spinal cord to the extremities of the body and back. The function of a peripheral nerve interface is to assist the nervous system when peripheral nerve function is compromised. To supplement the roles of the nervous system, interfaces need to augment motor function as well as discern sensory information. The feasibility of peripheral nerve stimulation to achieve a desired motor output has been demonstrated and is one of the major driving forces for this area of research.Bhadra N, Peckham PH. 1997. Peripheral nerve stimulation for restoration of motor function. J. Clin. Neurophysiol. 14:378‚Äì93 Information throughout the nervous system is exchanged primarily through action potentials. These signals occur at varying numbers and intervals dependent on both the neuroanatomical and neurochemical make up of the individual and localized region. Information may be either introduced or read out by inducing or recovering action potentials from the body. Successful development and implementation of a peripheral nerve interface would allow for both the introduction of information to the nervous system, and extraction of information from the nervous system. Problems and limitations Problems and limitations in peripheral nerve interfacing are both biophysical and biological in nature. These challenges include: *Fidelity of the interface in terms of functional resolution *Relatively weak, noise-ridden electrical signals causing a challenging interface design constraint *Interface implantation-associated injury to nerve fibers of interest *Stability of the interface over time due to inflammation *Managing inadvertent consequences such as pain or false sensory/motor stimulation due to physical movement or inflammation-associated triggering of neural activity Application Peripheral nerve interfaces are used for pain modulation,Weiner RL. 2000.

Types A wide variety of electrode designs have been researched, tested, and manufactured. These electrodes lie on a spectrum varying in degrees of invasiveness. Research in this area seeks to address issues centered around peripheral nerve/tissue damage, access to efferent and afferent signals, and selective recording/stimulation of nerve tissue. Ideally peripheral nerve interfaces are optimally designed to interface with biological constraints of peripheral nerve fibers, match the mechanical and electrical properties of the surrounding tissue, biocompatible with minimal immune response, high sensor resolution, are minimally invasive, and chronically stable with low signal-to-noise ratios. Strongest signals are recorded from nodes of ranvier. Peripheral nerve interfaces may be divided into extraneural and intrafascular categories. =Epineurial electrode interface= Epineurial electrodes are fabricated as longitudinal strips holding two or more contact sites to interface with peripheral nerves. These electrodes are placed on the nerve and secured by suturing to the epineurium. The suturing process requires delicate surgery and can be torn from the nerve if excessive motion creates tension. Since the electrode is sutured to the epineurium it is unlikely to damage the nerve trunk. =Helicoidal electrode interface= Helicoidal electrodes are placed cirumjacent to the nerve and are made of flexible platinum ribbon in a helical design. This design allows the electrode to conform to the size and shape of the nerve in attempts to minimize mechanical trauma. The structural design causes low selectivity. Helicoidal electrodes are currently used for FES stimulation of the vagus nerve to control intractable epilepsy, sleep apnea, and to treat depressive syndromes. =Book electrode interface= The book electrode consists of a silicone rubber block with slots. Each slot contains three platinum foils which function as electrodes, anode electrodes and one cathode. The spinal roots of the nerve are placed into these slots and the slots are then covered with a flap made of silicone and fixed with silicone glue. This electrode is mostly used to interrupt reflex circuits of the dorsal sacral roots and to control bladder function. Book electrodes are still considered very bulky.
