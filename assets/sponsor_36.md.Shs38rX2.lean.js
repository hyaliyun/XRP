The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour (later known as The Children's Hour) was a variety show with a cast of children, including some who later became well-known adult performers. It had a long run for more than three decades. The program was sponsored by Horn & Hardart, which owned restaurants, bakeshops and automats in New York City and Philadelphia. Radio Launched on Halloween day, October 31, 1927, the program was initially broadcast on WCAU Radio in Philadelphia, hosted by Stan Lee Broza, and was later aired on NBC Radio in New York City during the 1940s and 1950s. The original New York host was Paul Douglas, followed by Ralph Edwards and finally Ed Herlihy. Horn and Hardart's slogan was \\"Less work for mother dear whose gentle hands, lead us so kindly through little folk lands. We'll give her happiness, each kindness, each caress repaid with thoughtfulness. Less work for mother dear.\\" There were several versions of this song heard on the program: :Less work for mother; let's lend her a hand. :Less work for mother so she'll understand. :She's your greatest treasure; :Let's make her life a pleasure. :Less work for mother dear. Television When the program went to television, it was a radio-TV simulcast. The television premiere was on WCAU-TV in Philadelphia in 1948, followed by WNBT in New York in 1949, telecast on Sunday mornings. The hosts were Broza in Philadelphia and Herlihy in New York. A number of performers became quite successful after their work on the Philadelphia TV series, including Ted Arnold (musical director for Glenn Yarbrough and Jos√© Feliciano), Frankie Avalon, Rosemary Clooney, Buddy DeFranco, Eddie Fisher, Connie Francis, Dan Gralick, Joey Heatherton, Kitty Kallen, Rose Marie, Bernadette Peters, Ann Sheridan, Arnold Stang, Ezra Stone (radio's original Henry Aldrich) and Bea Wain. Al Alberts (of The Four Aces) had a 30-year children's variety show modeled on the Horn & Hardart show where he had appeared as a child.Dan Gralick Fred Rogers worked as a stage manager on the show, which he later described as \\"terrible\\" for forcing children to perform.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKjKZKpEkVY The closing song was sung to the tune of \\"A Bicycle built for Two\\": :Childhood, childhood :Sweetest days of all :Children playing hide and seek and ball :Tripping to school so merry :The Golden Rule to study :Oh, how we'll miss, the years of bliss :When our childhood days are gone.Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia The series came to an end in the summer of 1958.

History Grave markers in the cemetery at St. Gregory's Abbey In 1935, a group of American Episcopalians went to England to be trained by the Anglican Benedictines of Nashdom Abbey in Buckinghamshire. Some of this group returned to the US, became life-professed monks, and in 1939 formed St. Gregory's House in Valparaiso, Indiana. It soon became St. Gregory's Priory. The monks initially gained their living by taking charge of three mission churches in Episcopal Diocese of Northern Indiana under Bishop Campbell Gray. The three missions were: St. Stephen's in Hobart, St. Andrew's in Valparaiso and St. Augustine's Episcopal Church (Gary, Indiana). In 1946, the community moved to a rural setting near Three Rivers, Michigan, and grew considerably under the leadership of Dom Paul Severance. For 30 years, the monastery was a dependency of Nashdom Abbey and relied on the careful shepherding of its abbots. In 1969 St. Gregory's became an independent abbey, and the community's prior, Benedict Reid, was elected first abbot. In 1989, Andrew Marr was elected as his successor. Monastic life The monastery housework is done by the monks. This includes a good deal of outside work such as landscaping, gardening, and grounds maintenance. There are classes for the monks, correspondence to answer, sermons, retreats, and special ministries to prepare for. Community members occasionally minister in parish churches and other religious houses, and retreats conducted at the abbey. The frequency of external activities incidental to the normal life of a monk is regulated by the necessity of preserving Benedictine life. Work, study and prayer are the main activities, with prayer being the most important. The conventual Eucharist is the center of each day. In the past, the monastery celebrated the Tridentine Mass in Latin, but Mass is now celebrated from the 1979 Book of Common Prayer and with the celebrant facing the congregation.

When Gilbert was killed in 939, Reginar had to pledge fealty to King Otto the Great.

Young Storytellers currently serves elementary, middle, and high school students in Southern California, including the cities of Los Angeles, Culver City, Santa Monica, and Burbank. Young Storytellers targets Title 1 schools; these are schools and school districts with the highest concentrations of poverty in which academic performance tends to be low and the obstacles to raising performance are the greatest. The program improves writing, literacy, and self-confidence. History Young Storytellers began as an in-school mentoring program in 1997 - by three screenwriters Mikkel Bondesen, Brad Falchuk, and Andrew Barrett upon learning about cutbacks in funding for creative arts programs in the Los Angeles public schools. The first school adopted into the program was an elementary school in Culver City. The program was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) in 2003. Programs The organization benefits elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools. In 2016, 20th Century Fox invited Young Storytellers students to participate in the Fox Writers Intensive. Script to Stage The Script to Stage program is its main program whereby students in fifth grade write short plays in the course of ten weeks later to be performed by actors on stage. Students in the programs are selected on multiple criteria by teachers and can include students who are not proficient in the English language, have difficulty with reading and writing, or have social assimilation issues. The Script to Stage program produces 900 scripts per year. Volunteers The program is run in each school by a volunteer Head Mentor and volunteer Mentors. Each mentor works one-on-one with a student for the duration of the nine-week program to create a screenplay and the resulting screenplay is then performed by a volunteer performer. There are currently over 2,500 volunteers in Los Angeles serving 1,200 students in 60 schools. Funding The organization received grants from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association multiple times. In 2013 the organization was represented by Olivia Wilde and received a portion of the $1.6 million in grants given by the HFPA that year. 2016 in the amount of $10,000. In 2015, the organization received a grant from the $4.5 million given to the Los Angeles arts scene from Michael Bloomberg Philanthropies. Jane Fonda's, Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential, has also provided funding. Notable performers Young Storytellers' annual fundraiser, \\"The Biggest Show,\\" invites actors and comedians from film and television to perform their student's screenplays. In 2014, student screenplays were performed by Rob Corddry, Max Greenfield, John Cho, Alison Brie, Jillian Bell and Stephanie Beatriz. Corddry stated, \\"[the program] is kind of mythical in this world that I run in. You can't have a bad time. There's no pressure. You can't fail. It's pretty much everything you want as an actor. It's pretty much everything I've been looking for my whole life\\". In 2016, when asked about \\"The Biggest Show,\\" Seth Rogen said: \\"One of the main things that made me want to do it was to encourage these kids to continue to do this stuff.

The film stars Christian Bale and Freddy Rodriguez, and was written and directed by David Ayer. The film was distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Bauer Martinez Entertainment. Ayer says that the film's characters are largely based on the people he knew when he lived in South Central. Plot Jim Davis (Christian Bale) is a former U.S. Army Ranger who suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder. Jim has a Mexican girlfriend, Marta (Tammy Trull), whom he is determined to marry and bring into the United States to start a life together. With this in mind, Jim returns to Los Angeles, California. In Los Angeles, Jim meets up with his best friend Mike Alonzo (Freddy Rodriguez). Mike's longtime girlfriend, Sylvia (Eva Longoria), a young attorney, is \\"on the warpath\\" over his failure to get a job (his previous job was outsourced) and she encourages Jim to help Mike hand out resumes. After being denied a position in the Los Angeles Police Department for failing the psychological profile, Jim gets drunk with Mike. The two visit Jim's ex- girlfriend, but when her current boyfriend shows up, a fight ensues in which the boyfriend is backed up by a group of friends. Jim is able to get the upper hand and when Mike produces a gun, they subdue the men and rob them of their possessions, including marijuana and a handgun which they later decide to sell. Jim later leaves messages on Mike's answering machine with several different voices, pretending to be companies responding to his resume. The next day, Jim goes to visit Mike and finds Sylvia in a good mood due to the fake callbacks. Jim and Mike go to a \\"paisa\\" bar to try to sell the gun, but leave after their potential buyer is killed. Mike is horrified, but Jim is strangely excited by witnessing death again. When Mike arrives back home drunk, Sylvia is upset, so Mike plays back the answering machine, unaware that his friend didn't hang up early enough and his voice is heard on the tape. Sylvia is enraged and throws Mike out. He stays at Jim's place. Jim gets shortlisted for a position with the Department of Homeland Security, but, after cheating to pass a urine test, he fails a polygraph test due to a question about his drug use. The only hope left for him is a government agent working out of Colombia, who appreciates Jim's ability to \\"get things done\\"; Jim eventually accepts the position but is warned that he must not marry a foreigner. Jim is told to report to FLETC in a few days. Meanwhile, Mike gets a job with a company managed by an old friend. Mike goes to visit Sylvia and tells her that he has a job for real. She calms down and the two make love. Impatient, Jim goes inside and tells Sylvia that Mike is coming to Mexico with him for the weekend, as it is their last chance to hang out. Sylvia is angry and against the idea, but Mike decides to go with Jim and Marta to Mexico. In Mexico, the trio attend a big party where Marta reveals she is pregnant, and Jim responds violently, threatening to punch her in the stomach and shoot her in the head. On the way back, Jim reveals that he is transporting 20 kilos of marijuana. When Mike protests, Jim pulls a gun on him, flashing back, before breaking down in tears, horrified at what he is becoming. Mike, filled with pity for his friend, agrees to accompany Jim to the deal. When they arrive, they realize one of the buyers was the same man they had earlier robbed and beaten, the boyfriend of Jim's old flame. Hostility ensues with both Jim and the other gang members pulling out guns, resulting in the other man's death. The other members of the buying party plead for their lives, but Jim kills them while suffering flashbacks. While Jim and Mike are escaping in the car, a man comes from the house and shoots at the car with an Armsel Striker; Jim is hit in the back and face and subsequently paralyzed.

The school is located on a campus in the village of Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, near Boston. Beaver is a member of the Cum Laude Society, the Independent Curriculum Group, and the National Association of Independent Schools. Beaver is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.  History  Beaver's Main Building Beaver was incorporated as an elementary school and an all-girls' high school in 1920 by a group of parents who were interested in progressive education and the Country Day School movement. The school took its name in Boston, where some of the founders had been involved with a school for younger children later referred to as \\"Little Beaver.\\" In an amusing historical chain, it seems that Beaver Place was possibly named for the Beaver, one of the ships of the Boston Tea Party; the ship‚Äîa Nantucket trading vessel owned by Joseph Rotch‚Äîwas in turn named for the North American beaver, the rodent whose pelt was valued in Europe as a source of felt for high-quality hats. Thus, the \\"how did the school get its name?\\" question has a convoluted answer. Beaver's first head of school was Eugene Randolph Smith, a progressive educator and a follower of the educational reformer John Dewey; Smith had previously been head of the Park School of Baltimore. The school opened in a facility in Brookline, and moved to the present Chestnut Hill campus in the mid-1920s. Crosby Hodgman succeeded Smith as headmaster in 1943 and led the school until 1967, when Donald Nickerson became head. Nickerson resigned in 1973 and was succeeded by Philip E. McCurdy. McCurdy's successor, Jerome B. Martin. led the school from 1985 until 1992, when the current head of school, Peter R. Hutton, took over. Peter Hutton will step down in June 2020, and Kim Sanders will take over as Head of School. From the 1930s into the early 1940s Beaver was part of the Eight-Year Study, an educational experiment to test the efficacy of progressive education. The school adopted coeducation in 1971. Painter Beatrice Van Ness founded the art department at the school in 1921 and remained on the faculty until 1949.  Students  Students and teachers at the fall Harvest Fest Beaver offers grades 6 through 12. Enrollment (2019-2020) is 491 students, of whom 355 are in the upper school (grades 9‚Äì12) and about 136 are in the middle school (grades 6‚Äì8). Classes average about 15 students; one hundred percent of Beaver graduates go on to four-year colleges and universities. The school community is diverse, with students coming from over 60 towns in the metropolitan Boston area and speaking 20 languages besides English at home. About 25% of students and 25% of faculty are of color. Twenty-five percent of students receive financial aid. Tuition for the 2019-2020 academic year for all grades was $51,925. Beaver is a part of the Eastern Independent League and fields interscholastic teams in sailing, soccer, field hockey, golf, cross country, basketball, fencing, volleyball, wrestling, squash, baseball, softball, tennis, ultimate, and lacrosse. In winter of 2011‚Äì2012, Beaver started competing in girls' ice hockey. In 2015‚Äì2016, the school added boys' ice hockey as a part of their athletic program. In 2018, the school added co-ed sailing as well.

Sprague de Camp, the second book of his Viagens Interplanetarias series and its subseries of stories set on the fictional planet Krishna. The book has a convoluted publication history. It was first published in the magazine Astounding Science Fiction as a four-part serial in the issues for October, 1950-January 1951. The text was redivided into two parts for its first publication in book form by Avalon Books, appearing as the separate volumes The Search for Zei (1962) and The Hand of Zei (1963). To facilitate the new division, de Camp wrote a new ending for the first and a new beginning for the second to briefly recapitulate the portion of the story already told. The two parts were then reissued together in paperback by Ace Books in 1963, back to back and inverted in relationship to each other, as an \\"Ace Double\\". The Ace versions were slightly abridged by the author. The first half of the novel was published in the UK by Compact Books as The Floating Continent in 1966. A restored text bringing both segments back together was finally published by Owlswick Press in 1981. A new paperback edition utilizing this text was issued by Ace Books in August 1982 as part of the standard edition of the Krishna novels, and was reprinted in March 1983. A later paperback edition was issued by Baen Books in March 1990. An E-book edition was published by Gollancz's SF Gateway imprint on September 29, 2011 as part of a general release of de Camp's works in electronic form.Orion Publishing Group's L. Sprague de Camp webpageAmazon.com entry for e-book edition The novel has been translated into Dutch, French, German and Czech.OCLC Number 37251860 As with all of the \\"Krishna\\" novels, the title of The Hand of Zei has a \\"Z\\" in it, a practice de Camp claimed to have devised to keep track of them. Short stories in the series do not follow the practice, nor do Viagens Interplanetarias works not set on Krishna. Plot summary Travel writer Dirk Barnevelt and lecturer George Tangaloa, associates of interplanetary explorer and documentarian Igor Shtain, are drafted on Shtain's disappearance to complete his commission to explore the Sargasso Sea-like Sunqar area of Krishna's Banjao Sea ‚Äî and incidentally to find Shtain, who is suspected to have been kidnapped to Krishna. Arriving on the planet, the Earthmen travel to their goal in disguise as native Krishnans; Barnevelt himself is given the alias of the famous general, Snyol of Plesht, from the Antarctic nation of Nichnyamadze (setting of the Krishnan short story \\"Calories\\"). Snyol's formidable reputation proves at various times both a boon and a hindrance to their mission. The two are dogged at every step by pirates from the Sunqar who believe their true goal is to disrupt the pirates' smuggling operation. Complications arise when the two become embroiled in the affairs of the native monarchy of Qirib, whose princess Zei is kidnapped by the pirates. Dirk is ordered by Queen Alvandi to recover the princess while George remains behind as a hostage. Dirk must therefore take the lead in rescuing Zei, putting down the pirates, recovering Shtain, and settling the affairs of Alvandi's topsy-turvy kingdom, in which the women bear arms and the men languish in perfumed idleness. To make matters worse, Dirk falls in love with Zei, an entanglement fraught with its own dangers and complications. Not only is she a princess, but as potential queen of Qirib she would have the responsibility of taking a new king-husband annually, ritually executing and feasting on each when his term as consort reaches its end. And even could that obstacle be overcome, as representatives of two different species Barnevelt and Zei supposedly could never be a true couple. Setting The planet Krishna is de Camp's premier creation in the Sword and Planet genre, representing both a tribute to the Barsoom novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs and an attempt to \\"get it right\\", reconstructing the concept logically, without what he regarded as Burroughs' biological and technological absurdities. De Camp intended the stories as \\"pure entertainment in the form of light, humorous, swashbuckling, interplanetary adventure-romances - a sort of sophisticated Burroughs-type story, more carefully thought out than their prototypes.\\"De Camp, L. Sprague. \\"The Krishna Stories\\" (Essay, in New Frontiers, v. 1, no. 1, December 1959, page 3.) As dated in the 1959 version of de Camp's essay \\"The Krishna Stories\\" and James Cambias's GURPS Planet Krishna (a 1997 gaming guide to the Viagens series authorized by de Camp), the main Krishnan events of The Hand of Zei take place in the year 2143 AD, falling between the second part of \\"Finished\\" and The Hostage of Zir, and making it the sixth story set on Krishna in terms of chronology. The introductory section of the story is set much earlier, on Earth in about 2132 AD, and the final scene is set slightly later, on Krishna in 2144 AD.De Camp, L. Sprague. \\"The Krishna Stories\\" (Essay, in New Frontiers, v. 1, no. 1, December 1959, page 6) Relationship to other works Like the other early Krishna story \\"Calories\\", The Hand of Zei may have been influenced by the author's then recent collaboration with Finn Ronne on the non-fiction book Antarctic Conquest: the Story of the Ronne Expedition 1946-1948 (1949); the ghostwriter protagonist has a relationship to his explorer boss similar to the one de Camp had with Ronne, and adopts the alias of an inhabitant of Krishna's Antarctic region. Of all the Krishna stories only these two make use of the Antarctic setting. References External links  \\" L.

Cootes. It depicts a mostly fictional story of mountain folklore and forgiveness, and has been translated into seven languages since its release. History Wright began visiting the Ozark Mountains in southern Missouri and northern Arkansas in 1898 at the bidding of his physician, who recommended two vacations a year in a more suitable climate for health reasons. In following his doctor's advice, he became acquainted with John and Anna Ross, known locally as Old Matt and Aunt Mollie. The people he encountered during his eight summers spent camping on the Rosses' land were the inspirations for his characters in the book. Plot summary The story depicts the lives of mountain people living in the Ozarks. The main story surrounds the relationship between Grant \\"Old Matt\\" Matthews Senior and Dad Howitt, an elderly, mysterious, learned man who has escaped the buzzing restlessness of the city to live in the backwoods neighborhood of Mutton Hollow. Howitt spends his time alone, acting as a mediator and friend to the mountain people, and trying to recover from his tragic past, which includes the prior deaths of his wife and children, and the later presumed madness and subsequent suicide of his only surviving child, his artist son (later referred to as \\"Mad Howard\\"). Howitt's reclusiveness has earned him the moniker \\"The Shepherd of The Hills\\", yet he befriends the Matthews clan (the strongest and most respected family in the area) who come to love and trust him. Old Matt and the Shepherd's common history (which only The Shepherd knows at the outset) involves Old Matt's daughter, who died while giving birth to her son (and Old Matt's grandson), Pete Howard: unbeknownst to the Matthews, Mad Howard is Pete's father, and thus The Shepherd is Pete's grandfather. Years earlier, Mad Howard returned home after spending time painting in the mountains, and one of his paintings became famous, as did he. That painting was of a young girl, pretty, standing beside a creek; the girl in the painting was Old Matt's daughter, with whom he had fallen in love. However, Mad Howard believed that his father's pride of family and place in society would never allow him to approve of his son's marriage to an Ozark country girl. Mad Howard packed up his paintings and returned to the city, leaving Old Matt's daughter with the impression that he would return. Once returning to the city, Mad Howard sent her a letter explaining that his father would not approve of their marriage. However, he never told his father about Old Matt's daughter and his relations with her; the secrecy drove a wedge between Mad Howard and his father, although his father never understood why. Meanwhile, Old Matt has sworn he will kill the man who abandoned his daughter, as well as his father, if ever he finds them. Over the years, Mad Howard's love for Old Matt's daughter and his guilt over abandoning her slowly drove him insane. Eventually, Mad Howard feigns suicide and leaves behind his city life. He goes to the Ozarks and learns that Old Matt's daughter is dead, but that she has a son who (like his father) suffers from mental instability. Mad Howard hides in the woods, living like a hermit, trying to atone for the wrongs he has done. Mad Howard is portrayed throughout the story as a ghostly person, masked and always hiding in the shadows, who reveals himself only to Pete (as a result, Pete is also believed to have some mental instability). The Shepherd is suffering a mental breakdown of his own over the presumed death of his son. Though The Shepherd is a pastor, he realizes that he has no true belief in the Good Shepherd he preaches to others; this crisis of faith pushes him over the edge. His doctor recommends he take a long vacation, so he spends some time wandering around the country, rediscovering and strengthening his faith. Eventually, he changes his name and moves to the hills to connect with what his son loved most. Here he finally learns of his son's secret, the subsequent death of the Matthews girl, and the identity of young Pete as his grandson. He keeps this and his true identity from everyone, knowing that Old Matt has sworn vengeance. The Shepherd also hopes to do what he can to atone for his son's actions and intends to spend the rest of his life helping these people and teaching them about the \\"true Shepherd\\". Only later in the story does The Shepherd discover that the ghostly figure is his son Mad Howard. Shortly afterwards, Mad Howard is shot while risking his life to save others. The Shepherd then confesses his identity to Old Matt and tells him that the betrayer of his daughter is still alive, but dying and desires to be forgiven. After The Shepherd's confession Old Matt, although angry, finds it within himself to forgive both father and son, and he and the Shepherd (along with his wife and Pete) go to Mad Howard's bedside. With the doctor and family present, Mad Howard looks at the painting of the Matthews girl. He speaks to her of their life together, saying, \\"I loved her, I--LOVED--HER. She was my natural mate. My other self. I belonged to her, she to me.\\" For a time he lies exhausted; then he rises on his arms and says, \\"Do you hear her? She is calling. She is calling again! Yes, sweetheart. Yes, dear, I am coming!\\" With that, Mad Howard dies and is buried in an unmarked section of a cave on Dewey Bald. Shortly thereafter, Pete also dies and was buried next to his mother. A backdrop storyline surrounds the pretty Samantha \\"Sammy\\" Lane and her love of Grant \\"Young Matt\\" Matthews, Jr. Young Matt is in love with Sammy, who is also being courted by two other men: Ollie Stewart (a \\"city slicker\\" who at the outset appears to have the inside track, but Sammy decides that she doesn't want to move to the city) and Wash Gibbs (leader of the Baldknobbers, a gang who terrorize the countryside wearing frightening masks with horns at their top and who rob banks and settlers as they see fit). Gibbs (whose father and Sammy's father Jim were involved with the Baldknobbers in the past) is jealous of Young Matt, and during the story kills Jim after he refuses to go along with one of the Baldknobbers schemes (it is during this episode that Mad Howard is shot by a posse mistaking him for one of the Baldknobbers). Eventually Sammy and Young Matt marry and have children of their own. The last chapter of the story skips ahead many years to an artist wandering through the mountains, looking for inspiration. He meets The Shepherd, and the two men converse casually for a time. The Shepherd notes that the mountains will eventually become \\"the haunt of curious idlers\\" once the railroad comes, but he will not be alive by then. For a few days they see one another regularly, conversing, and one day The Shepherd invites the artist to his home where the artist meets Sammy and Young Matt and their family. Inside, the artist takes special note of how nicely decorated the home is, and he is especially interested in one room, where paintings of good quality are hanging. He notices that the largest painting is veiled, hiding its content. The Shepherd never offers to show the young artist that painting, and the young artist does not ask to see it, but remains curious. The artist leaves the mountains, but returns the following summer. He is greeted by Young Matt and Sammy, and discovers that The Shepherd's prediction had come true - the railroad was blasting away nearby mountains, but he had died while the surveyors were in the area before construction had started (and was buried at Dewey Bald). It was then that, as requested by The Shepherd, the veiled painting is revealed to the young artist, who then becomes excited, knowing it immediately as Mad Howard's famous lost painting (though not revealed in the story it is implied that it is the painting of Old Matt's daughter). The young artist asks excitedly, \\"How - where did you find it?\\" They enter another room, as Young Matt and Sammy begin re-telling the story of The Shepherd of The Hills. Other portrayals The novel has been the basis for four films, the first in 1919, and a television movie. The best-known version is the 1941 film of the same name starring Harry Carey and John Wayne. The Shepherd of the Hills was a popular outdoor drama staged from May to October, from 1960 until what was initially announced as its final performance on October 19, 2013,https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304384104579141710952645676 in Branson, Missouri. However, the play was brought back the next year with a reduced performance schedule beginning on May 23, 2014. The outdoor play features more than eighty actors, forty horses, and an actual nightly burning of the cabin. In July 2017 new owners were announced as Jeff Johnson and Steve Faria purchased the property from the Snadon family and had a press conference to announce their plans to continue the play and turn the 177 acre property into the Shepherd of the Hills Homestead Adventure Park. William L. Reese, I, became acquainted with Harold Bell Wright in Pittsburg, Kansas, through the Disciples of Christ. While working on Shepherd of the Hills, Wright became disenchanted with his manuscript, opened the door to a potbelly stove, and tossed it into the blaze. Reese hastily proceeded to rescue the manuscript. The model for Uncle Ike's Post Office was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as the Levi Morrill Post Office and Homestead.

Architecture The SHIM6 architecture defines failure detection and locator pair exploration functions. The first is used to detect outages through the path defined by the current locator pair for a communication. To achieve this, hints provided by upper protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are used, or specific SHIM6 packet probes. The second function is used to determine valid locator pairs that could be used when an outage is detected. The ability to change locators while a communication is being held introduces security problems, so mechanisms based on applying cryptography to the address generation process (Cryptographically Generated Addresses, CGA), or on bounding the addresses to the prefixes assigned to a host through hash-based addresses were defined. These approaches are not needed for IPv4 because of the short address length (32 bits).

It had only minimal success and was eventually deregistered. The Party was established on August 21, 1951 and dissolved on June 26, 1958.  Leaders  * President: W.H. Courtenay * Vice President: Herbert Fuller * Secretary: E.O.B. Barrow * Chairman: Lionel Francis  Objectives  * to secure and extend the liberties, project the interests and develop the national life and prosperity of the people of Belize by all constitutional means; * work for the political, economic, social and cultural progress of the country; * develop the political life of the citizenry by shaping public opinion in party meetings and literature; * identify and support suitable members for elections; * secure the development of a planned policy for social and economic future of Belize. Despite these ideals, the party more often acted against any change, because it consisted of persons who were against the type of radical development proposed by the People's United Party (which was formed a year earlier).  Record in elections  * 1952 City Council election: Herbert Fuller named president after two attempts to elect a president failed. * 1954 General Election: Fielded seven candidates for nine seats; Toledo's Charles Westby elected. * 1956 City Council election: Fuller and Floss Cassasola elected from slate. * 1957 General Election: no persons elected.  Reception by Belizeans  Generally, most Belizeans felt that the National Party was hastily put together and offered no real constructive opposition to the PUP, who themselves were going through internal turmoil and had been co- opted by the British. NP members came from among the elite merchants, colonial supporters and members of the colonial apparatus who were against change and this hamstrung the Party in its attempts to gain favor with the Belizean people. The Party was terminated by resolution at a meeting of June 26, 1958. It merged with the Honduran Independence Party (HIP) a few days later to form the National Independence Party (Belize) (NIP).

Career=Wigan Athletic Born in Liverpool, Merseyside, Scott began his career at Wigan Athletic during the 2001‚Äì02 season, providing backup for the first-team goalkeepers, but he failed to make any significant backthrough into the first-team and was released after just one season with the club. Nottingham Forest Following Tynan's release from his Wigan Athletic contract, he teamed up with Nottingham Forest for the 2002‚Äì03 season. In total Scott spent two season with the club, again providing cover for the first-team and failing to make any appearances for the club, and left the club at the end of the 2003‚Äì04 season. Telford United During Tynan's time with Nottingham Forest, his lack of first team action prompted a loan move to Telford in order to get some experience, and Tynan enjoyed a two-month spell with the club, before returning to Nottingham Forest. Barnet Tynan joined Barnet in 2004 making 35 league appearances and gaining a Conference winner's medal. Rushden & Diamonds He signed for Rushden & Diamonds midway through the 2005‚Äì06 season for ¬£20,000. In one of his first few games for the club, Tynan was approached by one of his own supporters who confronted the goalkeeper during an away match at Cheltenham Town in an incident that Tynan said was \\"blown out of proportion\\". The supporter was subsequently banned for life despite Tynan's statement in his defence. Despite for the most part enjoying his second season at Diamonds, Tynan requested his contract be cancelled by mutual consent after a mixture of becoming disillusioned by then manager Garry Hill and a desire to be closer to his home in Liverpool. Hereford United In August 2006, Tynan was loaned to Hereford United for a short spell as emergency goalkeeping cover for Wayne Brown who was injured in the opening game of the season against Stockport County. During this loan spell Tynan enjoyed a good run of form and played his part in some memorable games, most notably the 3‚Äì0 defeat of Coventry City in the League Cup. He had his contract cancelled by Rushden in May 2007 at his own request. Ebbsfleet United After a trial at Morecambe Tynan signed for Ebbsfleet United on 10 August 2007, a day before the new season, to cover for Lance Cronin who sustained a finger injury. He played seven games for the club, and achieving Man of the Match in 3 before leaving in September to find a club in the north- west. Tynan is said to have really enjoyed his time at Ebbsfleet but became frustrated with the amount of travelling involved in the short-term deal. Northwich Victoria Tynan signed for Northwich Victoria, making his debut against Exeter City on 13 October 2007. He moved to Salford City in February 2010. He went on to sign an 18-month contract and after an impressive first season gained an international re-call with the England C Team and helping them to win the 4 Nations Tournament in Wales, the second time Tynan had won that particular competition before jetting off to Grenada and Barbados for a double header against their full international teams. Northwich decided against renewing Tynan's contract after he suffered a full thickness tear of his ACL in the league game against Histon which was played at Altrincham's ground due to Vics being locked out of their Marston's Arena home due to unpaid debts.http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/s/1191414_win_boost_for_city Vauxhall Motors Tynan joined Vauxhall Motors in the summer of 2010.

The culture of Philadelphia goes back to 1682 when Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn. Originally inhabited by the Lenape, Philadelphia was envisioned as a place where people could live without fear of persecution because of their religion. As a result, many Quakers, Mennonites, and others came to find refuge within the city. As Philadelphia grew into a major political and economic center of the United States, many different groups of religions and ethnicities flocked to the city. 19th and 20th century immigration and migration led to large concentrations of Irish, Italians, Germans, Asians, Puerto Ricans and African Americans. Philadelphia is still a major center of immigration, with large Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, East African, Middle Eastern, Indian and Mexican immigrant populations, among others. The city's cultural prominence has risen and fallen since its founding. The city has made contributions in art, music, television, architecture and food. Philadelphia institutions range from the Philadelphia Museum of Art to Pat's Steaks. People Quakers and the local Lenape. Before the first European settlers arrived, the region that would become Philadelphia was inhabited by the Lenape, a group of Native American people. The Lenape occasionally fought with the earliest Dutch settlers, but had much better relations with William Penn and the early inhabitants of the English subjects of the colony of Pennsylvania. Still, disease and development pushed the Lenape west. A member of the Religious Society of Friends (Quaker) who had faced religious persecution, Penn envisioned his colony as a place where many groups of people could live together and worship freely. Mennonites, Amish, Moravians and Pietists moved to the area during the 17th century. By the mid-18th century, Quakers and the English had become a minority in the colony as other ethnic groups such as the Welsh, Scots, free blacks, Germans, Ulter Scots, Finns, Swedes, Dutch Americans, and Irish moved to the city. Lutherans established places of worship as early as the 1720s and in 1748, led by Henry Muhlenberg, founded the Pennsylvania Ministerium. In 1734 followers of what would become the Schwenkfelder Church arrived in Philadelphia and settled in the region. The first American Presbytery was founded in 1706 in Philadelphia and a year later in September 1707 the Philadelphia Baptist Association was founded, the oldest Baptist association in the United States. The city's first Catholic chapel was built in 1733 and the city's first recorded practicing Jew, Nathan Levy, arrived as early as 1735. During most of the 19th century, immigrants mainly from Germany, England and Ireland settled in the city. Many of these immigrants were Catholic which fueled anti-Catholic feelings and organizations. In the 1840s Philadelphia became a major base for anti-Catholic Protestant groups which soon led to deadly riots in 1844. However, by the end of the 19th century, Roman Catholics had become the largest single denomination in Philadelphia, though all Protestant denominations combined remained a majority of the Christians in Philadelphia into the present day. During the last decades of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, the origin of immigrants shifted from England, Ireland, and Germany to Italy, Southern Europe, Russia, Poland, and Eastern Europe. Italians and Poles helped increase the city's Catholic population, but Jewish immigrants, mainly from Poland, Lithuania, and Russia, were the largest religion to settle in the city during this period. Supplementing the already settled German Jews, the city's Jewish population swelled from 5,000 in 1881 to 100,000 in 1905. Philadelphia's Italian population changed from 300 in 1870 to 77,000 in 1910. Hungarian and Polish immigrants also settled in the city, but in smaller numbers.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, pages 356, 488 - 491 In the 20th century political power began to shift from primarily white Protestants to Irish and Italian Catholics and Jews, with the city's first Catholic and Jewish mayors elected in 1963 and 1992 respectively.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, page 678 The Friendship Arch in Chinatown. In the second half of the 19th century immigration began from Latin America, mainly from Puerto Rico and Cuba. By the end of the 20th century Puerto Ricans became the largest Latino group in Philadelphia. Starting in the 1950s large numbers of Puerto Ricans settling primarily in North Philadelphia. Immigrants from China founded Chinatown in the 1870s and 1880s; over the next century, the neighborhood grew into a diverse community with immigrants from many Asian countries. By the 21st century, Philadelphia's two largest Asian ethnic groups were the Chinese and Koreans. Philadelphia became the earliest recorded East Coast city with a Korean community in the 1880s; early members were largely political exiles supporting Philip Jaisohn. Immigration from the Middle East to Philadelphia began as early as the 1880s with immigrants primarily from Lebanon. Starting in the 1960s immigrants from other Middle Eastern countries, such as Syria, the Palestinian territories and Iraq moved to the city. Other immigrants from Asia during the last decades of the 20th century include Indians, Vietnamese and Cambodians. Another community who established an identity in Philadelphia during the 20th century was the gay community. The city's homosexual community is centered in a portion of Washington Square West, nicknamed the \\"gayborhood\\" by residents.Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings, pages 39, 58 - 59 African Americans The first blacks in Philadelphia were slaves; with at most 1,500 people living as slaves in the city during the period slavery was legal. Slaves in Philadelphia usually lived in the same house of their owners and worked as servants or in their owners' shops. An abolition law in 1780 did not free any existing slaves, but banned the slave trade in Pennsylvania and freed the children of slaves born after the law was passed once they reached a certain age. By the time the law was passed, about 400 slaves and 800 free blacks lived in Philadelphia. Many newly freed slaves and escaped slaves from the South moved to the city, and by 1820 the city's African American population was nearly eleven percent. During this time one former slave, Richard Allen, founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia. As the African American population grew, so did white hostility towards them. African Americans were attacked and killed in the street and in their houses during a race riot in 1834, and four years later a state law was passed that prevented African Americans from voting. Abolitionists were also targets; they were prevented from spreading their message, and one of their meeting houses was burned.A Concise History of Philadelphia, pages 81 - 87 Cartoon about African American high society, 1829. In the latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century large numbers of African Americans migrated from the Southern United States to Philadelphia giving the city the largest African American population of a northern U.S. city. In 1896 W. E. B. Du Bois came to Philadelphia and wrote his sociological book The Philadelphia Negro. Du Bois' study of the city's African Americans found many lived in Center City with growing populations in West Philadelphia. Many African Americans lived in neighborhoods near the rich white families they worked for. There was also a small group of upper class African Americans, both educated, wealthy and Philadelphia born, who descended from freedmen earlier in the century. The aristocratic African Americans were generally isolated, not recognized or even known about by the white population and alienated from the rest of the city's African American population.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, pages 491 - 492 As Philadelphia grew more industrialized the new factories refused to hire African Americans, with only about one percent of Philadelphia's African American population finding employment with the factories. In 1899 W. E. B. Du Bois said that ninety percent of the African American population in the city was below the poverty line. White-collar office jobs also refused to hire African Americans and many worked as domestic workers. There were African Americans that did manage to own their own businesses, while other became professionals such as doctors and lawyers. In 1884 Christopher J. Perry founded The Philadelphia Tribune, a newspaper for African Americans. It wasn't until World War II that factories began hiring African Americans. The Philadelphia Police Department first hired African Americans in 1881 and in the 1950s the first African American promoted to Police Captain was James N. Reaves. Reaves went on to integrate patrol car crews. During the 1950s and 60s the factories and a large portion of the white population left the city. African Americans became the city's largest ethnic group, with most of North Philadelphia, West Philadelphia, Germantown and portions of South Philadelphia becoming black neighborhoods. Old black working-class neighborhoods became ghettos filled with vacant lots and houses due to loss of industrial jobs. Starting in the 1970s African Americans began to gain significant independent political influence in city government, with the city's first African American mayor, Wilson Goode, being elected in 1984. Starting at the end of the 20th century a new wave of immigrants directly from Africa settled in the city. Coming from over thirty different countries there are an estimated 55,000 African immigrants in Philadelphia. Philadelphia aristocracy By the second half of the 18th century Philadelphia had developed an upper-class society. Many of the families that made up the upper class could trace their lineage to the earliest Quaker settlers, though many of these had subsequently joined the Church of England or Presbyterian denominations. The Philadelphia upper class was exclusive; what mattered was a person's family, not a person's wealth. Inheritance was better than self-made wealth. In the late 19th century Mark Twain observed, \\"In Boston they ask how much does he know. In New York, how much is he worth. In Philadelphia, who were his parents.\\"A Concise History of Philadelphia, pages 27 - 28 A person could not enter Philadelphia society by acquisition of wealth, but their offspring, if they grew up well and married into the right family, could create a new lineage if the family stayed respectable. Philadelphia Union League. In the 18th century the wealth had been built on shipping, trade, and real estate. Despite the later generations' inheritance they were expected to pursue a career. The acceptable careers in Philadelphia were medicine and law, with insurance, banking, and brokerage next in line on the ladder of acceptability. Running the family business was also acceptable especially if it related to iron and steel making, coal, and the railroads. Beyond their careers, the Philadelphia elite strived to have a seat on a board, particularly as the chairman of the board. Business boards such as the boards for the Pennsylvania Railroad and Philadelphia Savings Fund Society were important, but so were charitable, institutional, cultural and social boards.The Perennial Philadelphians: The Anatomy of an American Aristocracy, pages 69 - 70, 219 The Philadelphia upper class engaged in fox hunting, race horse breeding, attending balls and lavishly entertaining in their townhouses or mansions. The elite also joined exclusive clubs such as the State in Schuylkill and the Philadelphia Union League. The upper class started with mansions in Old City, but through the 18th and 19th centuries upper class gradually moved west through Center City until the end of the 19th century when much of the upper class moved to large mansions along the Pennsylvania Main Line. The Philadelphia aristocracy lasted well into the 20th century but by the end of the century the old rich families were overwhelmed by the new rich. By the late 20th century, membership in the upper class was defined less by ancestry, and organizations such as the Union League began to accept limited numbers of Jews, Catholics, and African Americans. Art=Fine art Charles Willson Peale's self-portrait The Artist in His Museum. Before the American Revolution the upper class increasingly began to support the arts, particularly through a demand for portrait paintings. The demand for portraits made Philadelphia attractive to artists and many came to the city, including William Williams who introduced oil painting to another Philadelphia artist, Benjamin West. In 1805 an art collector, believing Philadelphia the best place for the encouragement of artistic taste, offered the city numerous paintings, sculptures, engravings and other art work. To accept the gift the city formed the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. The Academy, the oldest art school and museum in the United States, helped establish many artists. Portraitist Charles Willson Peale and sculptor William Rush helped found the Academy of the Fine Arts and artists such as Thomas Eakins, Henry Ossawa Tanner and some of the members of the Philadelphia Ten studied there.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, pages 89, 245 - 247 The city's major art museum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art was founded in 1876 to maintain the art exhibits from the Centennial Exposition. The museum holds over 225,000 pieces of artwork including work by Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, and Marcel Duchamp. Not far from the Museum of Art is the Rodin Museum. The museum, founded in 1929, is the largest collection of Auguste Rodin work outside France.Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings, pages 73, 76, and 77 Planned nearby is a new museum intended to hold the collection of the Barnes Foundation. In 1923 Albert C. Barnes was outraged that his collection of paintings by Paul C√©zanne, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso and Amedeo Modigliani was so poorly received by Philadelphians when put on display at the Academy of the Fine Arts that Barnes removed the collection and housed it in a building in Merion, Pennsylvania where Barnes enjoyed denying access to most Philadelphians. The controversial decision in 2002 to, against Barnes' wishes expressed in his will, move the collection to Philadelphia was based on financial reasons. In 1991, to promote Old City art galleries, the Old City Art Association began First Fridays. On the first Friday of every month, Old City galleries hold a collaborative open house night. Philadelphia has more public art than any other American city. The inclusion of decorative art in Philadelphia structures goes back to the 19th century. In 1872, the Fairmount Park Art Association was created, the first private association in the United States dedicated to integrating public art and urban planning. The Association is responsible for the art along the Schuylkill River drives. In the late 1950s, the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority included a clause in its development contracts requiring that at least one percent of construction budget be allocated to fine art. In 1959, lobbying by the Artists Equity Association helped create the Percent for Art ordinance, the first for a U.S. city. The program, which has funded more than 200 pieces of public art, is administered by the Philadelphia Office of Arts and Culture, the city's art agency. Philadelphia has more murals than any other U.S. city. In 1984, the Department of Recreation created the Mural Arts Program. The program, an extension of the city's Anti-Graffiti Network, is intended to beautify neighborhoods and also provide an outlet for graffiti artists. The Mural Arts Program, which became independent from the Anti-Graffiti Network in 1996, has funded more than 2,300 murals created by professional, staff and volunteer artists. The program also runs art education programs and tours of the murals. Music Music began to be a major part of city life in the middle of the 18th century. Organs began to appear in non-Quaker churches and the city staged its first opera, The Beggar's Opera. The city's musical scene grew in the 19th century with the music of William Henry Fry, and the founding of the Musical Fund Society which began underwriting concerts in 1820. The Musical Fund Society begat the Academy of Music in 1857, which now hosts the Philly Pops, the Pennsylvania Ballet and the Opera Company of Philadelphia.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, pages 91, 345 Founded in 1900, the Philadelphia Orchestra, once called Philadelphia's \\"chief contribution to civilization\\" by Lawrence Gilman of the New York Herald, rose to prominence with conductors Leopold Stokowski and Eugene Ormandy in the middle of the 20th century.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, pages 631 - 632 The orchestra's home was the Academy of Music until the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts opened in 2001. The city developed an early jazz scene with many future luminaries, such as John Coltrane and Charlie Biddle, coming out of Philadelphia. In 1952, WFIL-TV premiered Bandstand which, in a few years, would become American Bandstand hosted by Dick Clark. The national success of the show led to rise of local music labels such as Swan Records, Cameo-Parkway and Chancellor Records. The 1960s saw the development of Philadelphia soul, led by producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. Towards the end of the century Philadelphia artists made contribution to Hip hop music with artists such as DJ Jazzy Jeff, Will Smith, The Roots, and Schoolly D. Philadelphia is also a cultural center for rock music, with multiple nationally recognized rock music radio stations, including WMMR, the now-shuttered WYSP, and others. The city is a top tour venue for rock musicians. More recently, Philadelphia has been home to a number of acclaimed independent alternative musicians. Dr. Dog, The War on Drugs, Kurt Vile, Nothing (band), Philadelphia Slick, Alex G, and Beach Slang all call Philadelphia their home. Performing arts Philadelphia's Spiral Q Puppet Theater performing in West Philadelphia's Clark Park. In Philadelphia's early history the city was visited by outside theater troupes, but experienced some resistance from conservatives and Quakers who tried to restrict performances. The creation of the Southwark Theatre in Philadelphia in 1766 marked the permanent presence of theater in Philadelphia. Theatrical performances were banned during the American Revolution, but when the ban was repealed in 1784 theater returned and another theater, the Chestnut Street Theatre, opened a decade later.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, pages 81, 191 - 192 Over the next century a number of other theaters opened in the city including the Walnut Street Theatre and the Forrest Theater. Philadelphia produced several major theater actors, including Edwin Forrest, John Drew, and several members of the Barrymore family.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, pages 249, 341, 515 The Philadelphia Theater Company, founded in 1974 and specializes in new American plays, used to perform in the Plays and Players Theatre but moved into the Suzanne Roberts Theatre on the Avenue of the Arts in 2007. Other modern theaters include the Arden Theater Company, the Wilma Theater, Lantern Theater Company, and the University of the Arts' Merriam and Arts Bank theaters. The University of Pennsylvania puts on productions at the Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts, the Irvine Auditorium and the Iron Gate Theater. African American themed plays are put on at the Freedom Theater and the Bushfire Theater. Other theater companies include the Adrienne, the InterAct Theater Company, the Venture Company, the Mum Puppet Theater and the new play development conference PlayPenn. Every year the Philadelphia Shakespeare Festival performs three Shakespeare plays.Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings, pages 71 - 73, 287 - 288 There are an estimated 120 theater organizations in the Philadelphia area. The Theatre Alliance of Greater Philadelphia was formed in 1990 form its predecessor, the Performing Arts League of Philadelphia, to promote local theater; since 1994, the organization has presented the annual Barrymore Awards for Excellence in Theater to theater productions in the area. Dance became a part of Philadelphia with the beginning of the Philadelphia Dancing Assemblies in 1748 which remained popular into the 20th Century.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, page 96 Major dancing organizations include the Pennsylvania Ballet founded in 1963. The Pennsylvania Ballet performs in the Academy of Music and the Merriam Theater.Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings, page 286 The Philadelphia Dance Company (Phildanco) was founded in 1970 and specializes in modern dance. The Koresh Dance Company was formed in 1991 and performs choreography that mixes elements of ballet, jazz, modern dance, and other dance forms.http://www.koreshdance.org/ Film and television Lubin Studios open air set in 1899. On December 18, 1895 Charles Francis Jenkins showed off his film projector at the Franklin Institute. It was the first demonstration of moving pictures using flexible film in Philadelphia. A week later Woodville Latham's eidoloscope was shown to Philadelphia audiences. German immigrant and optician, Siegmund Lubin, was impressed with the technology and bought Jenkins' camera. In Philadelphia he filmed his first film, his horse eating hay. Lubin continued to make films in Philadelphia, now showing them commercially, and built his own cameras and projectors which he marketed. He eventually created a production company, Lubin Manufacturing Company, in 1902. Shortly afterwards Lubin opened up some of the cities first movie theaters and in 1905 Jules Mastbaum opened the city's first Nickelodeon. Lubin Studios shut down in 1917 and through most of the 20th Century Philadelphia had an almost non-existent film industry. In 1985 the Greater Philadelphia Film Office was created as part of the city government, and, in 1992, it became a regional economic office. Since 1992 the GPFO, which promotes the Philadelphia region and helps coordinate film productions, has assisted in the making of over 200 films and television shows. Between 1992 and 2002 film productions have brought in US$500 Million to the city's economy. In 2007 MovieMaker Magazine named Philadelphia the second-best American city to make a movie in. The magazine cites local talent, cost of living and help provided by the Philadelphia Film Office as reasons. Several months after the MovieMaker Magazine article, Pacifica Ventures announced that it will be opening a film studio in the Philadelphia area in 2008. Every year Philadelphia hosts the Philadelphia Film Festival and the Philadelphia International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival. The Philadelphia Asian American Film Festival started in October 2008. In the early 1930s Philco Corp. founded Philadelphia's first experimental television station, W3XE. That station became NBC's first affiliate in 1939, and in 1941 the station became WPTZ-TV after it was granted Philadelphia's first commercial license. By the late 1940s WPTZ, which would eventually become CBS owned and operated KYW-TV, was joined by WCAU-TV and WFIL-TV, now WPVI-TV. In succeeding decades, WHYY-TV, WPHL-TV, WTXF-TV and WPSG-TV joined the Philadelphia market. According to Nielsen Media Research Philadelphia has the fourth largest media market in the U.S. Major shows that were broadcast out of Philadelphia include American Bandstand, Double Dare and The Mike Douglas Show. Cuisine McGillin's Olde Ale House. Geno's Steaks. Reading Terminal Market. Philadelphia is the home of many culinary institutions, both gourmet and local staples. The city's immigrant history has allowed many tastes to mix and develop. The cheesesteak, created in Philadelphia in the 1930s, is a well known city icon. A popular Philadelphia argument is which of two cheesesteak rivals has the best steaks, Pat's Steaks, which invented the cheesesteak, and Geno's Steaks. Italian ice (often referred to exclusively as \\"water ice\\" in the Philadelphia area) and soft pretzels were not invented in Philadelphia, but because of their popularity and availability have become Philadelphia staples.Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings, pages 85 - 88 Irish potato candy is a popular Philadelphia confection that is especially popular around St. Patrick's Day. During the 18th century city taverns such as the London Coffee House and Tun Tavern (birthplace of the United States Marine Corps in 1775) were regular meeting places for the political and business leaders. Another tavern frequented by politicians is McGillin's Olde Ale House , which is the oldest continuously operated tavern in the city. In the late 19th century two Philadelphia landmarks were created, the Reading Terminal Market and Italian Market which sell all types of food and other commodities. The early 20th century saw the creation of the first automat in the United States on Chestnut Street and the founding of the Tasty Baking Company. For most of the 20th century fine dining could only be found in private clubs or dinner parties, but with the beginning of the city's revival in the 1970s a restaurant renaissance began.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, page 716 Starting with Le Bec-Fin in 1970 many upscale restaurants have sprung up in the popular neighborhoods. Philadelphia has since added over 150 fine dining establishments, famously including the several upscale trendy restaurants of Stephen Starr as well as dozens of sidewalk cafes and trendy bars. Such a renaissance has led to an acclamation of Philadelphia as a world-class \\"food city\\". Philadelphia's large Chinese, Vietnamese, and East African populations have made their marks on Philadelphia's dining scene. Philly Chinatown is home to first-class Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, and Malaysian foods. South Philly has many Vietnamese and Chinese restaurants, and West Philly is home to multiple East African restaurants, including four Ethiopian restaurants. Philadelphia also has numerous Indian and Middle-Eastern restaurants in Center City and West Philly.  Grassroots culture  Not every Philadelphian eats out or goes to the theater, but most Philadelphians participate in local and community activities and organizations. Block parties and yard sales abound on weekends. Philadelphia has vibrant local markets, such as the biweekly market in Clark Park at 43rd and Baltimore, where local farmers sell produce and artists and antique collectors show their wares. Philadelphia is also home to food cooperatives such as West Philly's Mariposa. Cooling off with a fire hydrant in the summer Environmental preservation and maintaining local connections are important to many Philadelphia communities. Many Philadelphians choose bikes over cars, and car-rental organizations like PhillyCarShare have reduced the number of cars in the city. Philadelphia has a thriving horticultural community and numerous community gardens. Philadelphia has a long history of graffiti culture. The Philadelphia Anti-Graffiti Network, which gave way to the Mural Arts Project, has reduced the incidence of graffiti, but South Street is full of graffiti, and writers still perform their craft, legally and illegally, on walls throughout the city. Philadelphia has thriving non-profits in all areas of community service. Books Through Bars, which collects books to distribute at prisons, started in Philadelphia. Philadelphia is home to one of the largest National Network for Abortion Funds (NNAF) and the Women's Medical Fund. Philly Fellows, started in 2005, have been focusing efforts on \\"building capacity in the non-profit sector.\\" Philadelphia also has important faith-based organizations. Annual fairs and events Philadelphia holds many annual festivals and events. One of the most famous is the Mummers Parade. The first modern version of the parade was held in 1901 and is held every year on New Year's Day.Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings, page 81 The Saint Patrick's Day Parade, which is popular with the city's large Irish population, is the second oldest parade in the United States. There is also the annual Puerto Rican Day Parade, held in the city for over 50 years. Since 1993 every summer around the July 4th holiday, the multi-day Welcome America event celebrates Philadelphia as the birthplace of the United States. Three major annual shows in Philadelphia are the Philadelphia Flower Show in March, the Philadelphia International Auto Show in February and the Philadelphia Antiques Show in April.

It was produced by Alfredo Diaz Ordaz and released in Mexico on 9 October 1990, by Fonovisa Records. The album consisted of songs inspired in the 1980's rock, disco, pop, and ballads style. The first two singles \\"Un Pacto Entre Los Dos\\" and \\"Saliva\\" were highly controversial due to their suggestive lyrics, but were nonetheless highly successful, and are now considered Thal√≠a's classics along with \\"Amarillo Azul\\" and \\"Pienso En Ti\\". To celebrate Thal√≠a's 25 anniversary as a solo artist, this album is available in the digital platforms iTunes and Spotify since December 2014. Thal√≠a was certified 2√ó Gold in Mexico in 1991 and sold over 200,000 units there. Background and production In 1987, Thal√≠a joined the musical group Timbiriche, replacing member Sasha Sokol, one of the most popular members of the group and of whom Thal√≠a was a fan. With the band, Thal√≠a released two albums: Timbiriche VII, which was the most successful album of the group selling 1 million copies in Mexico and the double album Timbiriche VIII & IX, which sold around 500,000 copies in the country. Seeking greater freedom as an artist, in late 1989, Thal√≠a announced her departure from Timbiriche to pursue a solo career. In January 1990, the singer traveled to the United States to prepare musically. At the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), she took English, dance, singing and acting classes. The album was produced by Thal√≠a's mentor Alfredo D√≠az, who was in charge of the music departament of Televisa. The singer wanted to revive the Flower power movement and \\"to break from anything traditional\\". In the middle of that same year, she returned to Mexico with a new image and released her first LP on 9 October. \\"Un Pacto Entre los Dos\\" became its first promotional single for radio. Composition The album includes compositions by Thal√≠a, Alfredo D√≠az Ordaz, √Åureo Baqueiro, among others; with pop rock styles on songs like \\"Un Pacto Entre los Dos\\", \\"Libertad de Expresi√≥n\\" and \\"Talism√°n\\", even ballads such as \\"Pienso En Ti\\" and \\"El poder de tu amor\\". It was published in the three popular formats at the time: LP, cassette and compact disc. The first edition of the album was sold out just two weeks after its launch in her native country. The album was the subject of much controversy, due to the provocative and original lyrics of some songs in addition to the sensual and avant-garde image that the singer showed at that time. \\"Saliva\\" was banned on several radio stations in Mexico and \\"Un Pacto Entre los Dos\\" was considered \\"sadomasochistic\\". Promotion The first performance of the album's songs was held in October 1990 at a hotel in Mexico City. In 1991, Thal√≠a attended the talk show La Movida, hosted by Ver√≥nica Castro, where she performed live numerous songs from the album. Singles *\\"Un Pacto Entre los Dos\\": The album's lead single and Thal√≠a's debut solo single, the song was considered at that time as somewhat sadomasochistic. It was also criticized for the sensual and provocative outfits Thal√≠a wore on television performances, but despite that, the criticism did not stop the song from being a success in Mexico. The song's music video portrays Thal√≠a in an airport and also in a jungle, where she is chased by some men with spears, bows and arrows. *\\"Saliva\\": The second single from the album, it was released in late 1990. The song caused a lot of controversy at that time and was even banned on several radio stations in Mexico. The music video with participation of Ricky Luis was also released in 1990. The song was certified gold in Spain. *\\"Amarillo Azul\\": The third single from the album, released in early 1991. The song was written by Luis Caba√±a and Pablo Pinilla. It obtained less criticism than its predecessor singles. No music video was released for the song. *\\"Pienso En Ti\\": The fourth and final single from the album, released to the Mexican radio stations in 1991. The song was written by the composer Aureo Baqueiro. Thal√≠a dedicated it to her boyfriend at that time, the producer Alfredo Diaz. It is the first ballad Thal√≠a released as a single. Like \\"Amarillo Azul\\", it does not have a music video of its own. The song reached position number four in Mexico City and number five in San Salvador.

The character was played by actress Sharyn Hodgson appearing in its pilot episode in 1988. She remained a regular until 1991, and has made numerous guest appearances since this time. Development She was one of the soap's original female protagonists, appearing as one of the Fletchers' foster children in the pilot episode on 17 January 1988. The soap's primary focus was placed upon the Fletchers and their gang of foster children, moving as outsiders to a caravan park in the seaside town of Summer Bay. Carly remained in the serial as a regular character until 1991, covering issues such as rape, alcoholism and child abuse, as well as a problematic marriage to soldier Ben Lucini, played by actor Julian McMahon. Carly's rape, which occurred while she was hitchhiking in 1988, was one of the soap's first controversial story lines. Andrew Mercado, author of Super Aussie Soaps, has commented that \\"although the word 'rape' was never actually uttered on-screen, savvy viewers caught on. In the aftermath of her assault, Carly began drinking heavily and the ratings continued to grow. From a low of 9, Home and Away slowly built its audience until the show was scoring 25 by the end of its first year. The serial was finally a hit\\". In the storyline, Carly kept the rape a secret initially, but after the truth came out the residents of Summer Bay \\"were shown to be divided as to whether or not Carly had contributed to the situation through reckless behaviour\\". The aftermath of the event explored Carly's descent into alcoholism and drug abuse, which has been described as \\"very brave territory for a prime-time soap [...] the Carly Morris storyline pointed to the fact that if there were feathers to be ruffled, Home and Away would ruffle them.\\" During the time of the rape's airing, various protests were launched by the viewing public and the Australian media, who believed it should not have been broadcast. In an interview in 1989, Hodgson defended the storyline, saying \\"In Home and Away we show life as it really happens. It's not irresponsible to show attacks, unwanted pregnancies or people turning to alcohol. It's realistic and it shows we are confronting these problems. The thing about having a foster family as the main characters is that they do have trauma in their lives. Seeing how they cope must help people\\". Hodgson researched the storyline by calling the Rape Crisis Centre, reading articles and watching documentaries. Since being written out of the serial, Carly has made numerous appearances as a guest character to visit her foster family or attend important events in Summer Bay. The character has since appeared in 1997; 2000; 2001; 2002 & 2008\\\\. Carly's return in 2002 was part of Home and Away producers' attempt to counter a ratings slump, said to have resulted from the \\"unexpected success\\" of rival network's reality TV show Big Brother, which was aired opposite the soap at 7pm weekdays. Hodgson was one of numerous returning cast members, brought back especially for the storyline to mark the 150th anniversary of settlement in Summer Bay. The majority of the cast was boarded onto a ferry boat for a night cruise; however, a \\"freak storm\\" ruined the celebrations, leading the boat to sink. The storyline was heavily promoted with the tag \\"Who Will Survive?\\". According to Mercado, \\"Big Brother 2 crumbled against the competition [...]\\". Carly's last appearance, in 2008, was part of the leaving storyline of her foster sister Sally Fletcher, played by actor Kate Ritchie, an original character who departed the serial after 20 years. When she returns in the early 2000s, Carly is still married to Ben, who remains off-screen. The pair also have children together. Storylines Carly as she appeared in 2008 Carly came from an abusive home. Her father George (Helmut Bakaitis) used to beat her, and she had a tempestuous relationship with her twin sister Samantha (also played by Hodgson). Following the death of her mother from a problem with her appendix, she was placed in foster care with the Fletcher family and moves with them to Summer Bay in 1988, aged 16. A problematic, selfish teenager, Carly is frequently in trouble at school, and she feuds with her foster sister Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson), though they later patch up their differences and become close friends. Carly attracts the attention of local boy Martin Dibble (Craig Thomson), but she rebuffs his advances preferring surfer Matt Wilson (Greg Benson), though her attempts to attract his attention go unnoticed, and she nearly drowns when she set up a ploy for him to rescue her from the sea. Martin, luckily, is on hand to save Carly. Whilst hitch-hiking home from visiting Nico Pappas (Nicholas Papademetriou) at the hospital in 1988, Carly is raped. Unable to cope with what had happened to her, Carly begins drinking alcohol heavily and using drugs, but curtailed the problem via counseling. Carly then returns to school to repeat Year 12 after failing her HSC but drops out early on to work at the Bayside Diner. Carly becomes involved with her former teacher, Andrew Foley (Peter Bensley) but the relationship falls apart when he succumbs to alcoholism. Carly later dates Adam Cameron (Mat Stevenson) but he later breaks up with her to be with Emma Jackson (Dannii Minogue). Italian soldier Ben Lucini arrives in Summer Bay and is instantly attracted to Carly, they quickly become engaged and marry within months. Ben leaves the army and attempts a career as a farmer, but money is tight for the couple, leading to strain on the marriage. Carly then discovers she is pregnant, which Ben reacts badly to at first but comes round the idea. After Ben is arrested by military police for desertion, the couple relocate to Perth. They depart in 1991 and later have three children. Although Carly gives birth to a girl named Phillipa in the show, she is later retconned out of existence with Carly and Ben repeatedly being stated to have three sons. Carly returns in 1997 for the wedding of Steven Matheson (Adam Willits) and Selina Roberts (Tempany Deckert), which does not go ahead. She returns three years later for Sally Fletcher's (Kate Ritchie) non-wedding to Kieran Fletcher (Spencer McLaren) and then the next year to support Sally when she undergoes a hysterectomy. In 2002, Summer Bay celebrates its 15th anniversary and Carly returns along with several other past residents. Carly, Steven, Pippa and Floss McPhee (Sheila Kennelly) return for Sally's tearful farewell concert at the school in 2008. In other media A tie-in novel, written by Sharon Clarke, concentrating on Carly Morris and her foster brother Steven Matheson, was released in 1990. Called Carly Morris Story and Steven Matheson Story, the novel chronicled the characters' lives before being fostered by the Fletcher family, outlining their backstories of child abuse and hardship, as well as Carly's history with her malicious twin sister. Another tie-in novel featuring the character includes Carly's Crisis, which covers her alcohol problems shown in episodes up to 1989, written by Trish Howarth. Hodgson as Carly was one of several Home and Away cast-members to star in a stage musical about the soap, which toured the UK in 1991. Julian McMahon, Justine Clarke, Mouche Phillips and Adam Willits also starred.

She first appeared during the episode that aired on 10 September 2001 and departed following her on-screen death on 3 September 2002. Character development Charlotte is described by Network Seven as \\"pretty, smart, generous and sincere\\" and has \\"an uncanny ability to draw people out and make them feel good about themselves\\". Charlotte likes to meet new people and learn about their life. Charlotte works in medicine and enrolled in medical school so she could carry out work on a professional level. She is also described \\"fairly bright\\" but \\"no genius\\" so she struggles to get through her degree. Charlotte often surprises herself when she succeeds in her work and not one to boast Charlotte just \\"claims she was lucky\\". Producers decided to write the character out of Home and Away in 2002. Chaves-Jacobsen told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap that \\"it's sad but it's just something that happens.\\" Storylines Charlotte is first seen as a trainee doctor at Northern Districts hospital. Her first emergency is to treat her neighbour Jude Lawson (Ben Steel) who has been seriously injured in a motorcycle crash. Flynn Saunders (Martin Dingle-Wall) is on hand to help her in surgery and they are both able to save Jude's life. Charlotte soon becomes friends with Jude's teenage brother Noah (Beau Brady) and Seb Miller (Mitch Firth) who is living with them. Charlotte's boyfriend Dr. Steve Kent (Don Hany) lives in the city and she hardly gets to spend any time with him. When he does visit, Steve frequently suggests that Charlotte moves to the city with him and put her grandmother Gladys (Moya O'Sullivan) into a care home, which Charlotte refuses to do. Steve proposes and Charlotte accepts. On the night of the proposal, things take a horrible turn and when Noah, Jude and Hayley Smith (Bec Cartwright) return home they find a bruised Charlotte crying on the stairs. Charlotte then breaks up with Steve and later makes the agonising decision to commit Gladys to a home after she develops Alzheimer's and causes a fire.

Charlotte and the paramedics battle to save Miles, but ultimately fail and he dies at the scene. Following a post-HSC party, Charlotte and Jude begin dating. Charlotte later discovers she is pregnant with twins and turns to Flynn for support, much to Jude's anger as he feels that another one of his girlfriends feels more comfortable talking to Flynn. Jude then explains that his ex-girlfriend Shauna Bradley (Kylie Watson) had made a pass at Flynn several months earlier. Charlotte assures Jude she will never let him and down and he moves in with her at Sally's. Charlotte wakes up one morning to find her morning sickness has eased and she goes into hospital to have ultrasound only to find she has miscarried and is left devastated. Rhys (Michael Beckley) and Shelley Sutherland (Paula Forrest), who had miscarried a son 15 years earlier, help Jude and Charlotte through their difficult time and arrange a memorial on the beach for the twist. Shauna returns to Summer Bay and Charlotte worries if Jude will remain faithful. Jude later admits he still love Shauna and tells Charlotte he is leaving with her to go to Melbourne. Charlotte falls in into a depression and starts self-prescribing and develops an unhealthy attachment to a baby whose mother is having trouble. Sally and Flynn intervene before things get worse. When her superior at Northern Districts, Dr. Carlingford (Alan Faulkner) verbally chastises her one time too many, Charlotte resigns and decides to leave Summer Bay. Prior to her departure, Charlotte learns she has inherity a large sum of money from a patient who has died in her care. Mav Patterson (Clayton Williams) convinces Charlotte to invest in an Vietnam orphanage and leave the Bay with him. On the day of Charlotte's departure after a party at Sally's where she says a heartfelt goodbye to her friends she goes for a final swim in the ocean. However she is pulled under by a rip and is rescued by lifeguard Josh West (Daniel Collopy). During her last few seconds of consciousness, Charlotte sees a vision of Jude underwater. She is then resuscitated and hospitalised. After being admitted, Charlotte begins asking for Jude. Jude returns from Melbourne almost immediately and spends time with Charlotte who soon dies after suffering complications. Charlotte's death has an effect on several other people; Josh who blames himself for not putting up the right flags and resigns as a lifeguard, and Jade Sutherland (Kate Garven) who decides to \\"live for the moment\\". Following Charlotte's memorial service, Jude discovers she has not updated her will, leaving him as the sole beneficiary of her money.

Spang, Rolf-Harald. Wippich, p. 1 Biography  Eulenburg was born in K√∂nigsberg. He was the oldest surviving child of Friedrich Leopold Graf zu Eulenburg (Prassen, 26 December 1787 - K√∂nigsberg, 30 July 1845) and Amalie Julie Eleonore n√©e von Kleist (Perkuiken, 26 May 1792 - K√∂nigsberg, 16 November 1830). Eulenburg studied law at the Universities of K√∂nigsberg and BonnBiography at Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie and worked as a government official in Oppeln then in various ministries in Berlin. In 1852 he entered the diplomatic service as the Prussian Consul-General in Antwerp. The expansion of Prussian trade led to the search of commercial partners in South- East and Eastern Asia and he was chosen to lead an extensive trade mission. Departing in October 1859 he set out for Japan, China and Siam. In 24 January 1861, he concluded a Japanese-Prussian Treaty of Amity and Commerce with Muragaki Norimasa of the Tokugawa shogunate in Edo period, which was based on Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce. In September the same year, he concluded a commercial treaty with the Qing Empire, which was similar to the Treaties of Tianjin that Britain and France had concluded with China three years earlier. Wilhelm I of Prussia (with top hat) and Nikolaus zu Nassau at Bad Ems Following his return he was appointed the Interior Minister of Prussia on 8 December 1862. Following the growth in the administrative area of Prussian state in 1864 and 1866, Eulenburg instituted comprehensive administrative reform also in the old provinces. However he was met by opposition by the Catholics in the west and the liberals in the east. He accompanied King Wilhelm I of Prussia in the negotiations with the French ambassador Count Benedetti at Bad Ems prior to the Franco-Prussian War. His plan to reform the municipal administration in Prussia was opposed by Otto von Bismarck and Eulenburg resigned on 30 November 1878 to be succeeded by his first cousin once removed Botho zu Eulenburg.

Its aim was to establish diplomatic and commercial relations with China, Japan and Siam. SMS Arcona Background In 1859, King Prince William, who was acting as regent for his seriously ill brother Friedrich Wilhelm IV, appointed Friedrich Albrecht Count of Eulenburg Extraordinary Envoy to a Prussian Mission to Eastern Asia. The major participants of the expedition were Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg, Lucius von Ballhausen (doctor), Max von Brandt (attach√©), Wilhelm Heine (painter), Albert Berg (artist), Karl Eduard Heusner, Fritz von Hollmann, Werner Von Reinhold, Ferdinand von Richthofen and Gustav Spiess. The expedition was provided with three warships from the Prussian East Asian Squadron, the , the and the .  Japan  Guesthouse for foreigners in Edo, built 1859 (marked on upper left). It was in close vicinity to Shogunate family cemetery in Z≈çj≈ç-ji Temple (lower right). Before the expedition even reached Japan, the Frauenlob was lost in a typhoon outside Yokohama on 5 September 1860, losing its entire crew of five officers and 42 men, and the two remaining ships decided to anchor in Edo Bay. The negotiations with the Bakufu were protracted and would last for several months. Before the treaty was signed, Count Eulenburg suffered another setback. During the negotiations with the Bakufu, Count Eulenburg had been assisted by Henry Heusken, a Dutch-American interpreter who usually worked for the US consul Townsend Harris. After having dinner with Count Eulenburg on the night of 15 January 1861, Heusken repaired to the American Legation at Zenpuku Temple in Edo. He was accompanied by three mounted officers and four footmen bearing lanterns. The party was suddenly ambushed by seven shishi from the Satsuma clan. Heusken suffered mortal wounds to both sides of his body in the fight. He mounted a horse and galloped about 200 yards to the American Legation, where he was taken inside and treated. Later that night Heusken died of his wounds. This setback did not derail the treaty negotiations, and after four months of negotiations, Count Eulenburg and representatives from the Bakufu signed the \\"Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation\\" on 24 January 1861. The treaty was based on other commercial treaties that Japan had signed with other Western powers and it would later count as one of the serial \\"unequal treaties\\" that Japan had been forced to sign in the late Tokugawa period.Auslin, Michael R. (2004) China In May 1861, the Eulenburg expedition arrived in Tianjin, where Count Eulenburg initiated negotiations with the Zongli Yamen for a commercial treaty with the Qing Empire. This was not at a very good time for China, since Britain and France had just invaded Beijing in the Second Opium War and the Xianfeng Emperor was still exiled in Chengde. The negotiations took three months and the Emperor died in late August. Finally on 2 September 1861, Count Eulenburg and Qing representative Chonglun signed a commercial treaty with the Qing Empire, which was modeled on the French Treaty of Tianjin. In the treaty, Prussia represented the whole German Customs Union and the treaty would govern Sino-German relations until World War I, when the treaty was repudiated by China. Siam When the expedition reached Siam, the delegation had been expected by King Mongkut for a year. He \\"expressed his delight and inquired about the number and size of the warships, immediately thereafter he asked if the Prussians maintained colonies or had the intention to acquire them.\\" The question answered in the negative \\"consoled him: he was all the more delighted to gain new unselfish friends as the old ones just became difficult\\" (Fritz Count of Eulenburg). After a long stay, on 17 February 1862 Fritz Count of Eulenburg signed a Treaty in the name of Prussia, the States of the Customs Union and Mecklenburg. Legacy An Account of the expedition published by Werner Von Reinhold Several participants in the expedition, including Count Eulenburg himself, wrote accounts of the East Asian expedition. Ferdinand von Richthofen later remarked that of the 64 Naval officers who took part in the expedition, 23 went on to have substantial rank in later years.

It is an alternate history revolving around the experiences of identical twin brothers during the Second World War, during which one becomes a pilot for the RAF, and the other, a conscientious objector, becomes an ambulance driver for the Red Cross. The author introduces a deliberate confusion by giving these brothers identical initials ‚Äì J.L. Sawyer ‚Äì one known as Jack (the pilot) and the other as Joe (the ambulance driver). Multiple histories ‚Äì at least two, and on some readings many more ‚Äì are presented, with different roles and fates for the various characters. The novel abounds with plays on the uncertainty of identity not just between the twin brothers, but also that of Winston Churchill (who used look-alike stand-ins) and, crucially, Rudolf Hess, Hitler's deputy, who flew to Britain in 1941 claiming to have a peace offer from Hitler. The novel also utilises a favourite technique of Priest's, that of the unreliable narrator. Publication The novel was first published in the United Kingdom in 2002, in trade paperback by Scribners (), followed by a hardcover by Gollancz () in 2003. It was not published in the United States until 2005, when it was published in hardback by Old Earth Books (). The Separation was translated into French by Michelle Charrier; it has also appeared in a Spanish translation. Re-Publication British magazine The Bookseller reported in May 2003, that The Separation was \\"to be republished by Orion after the author bought back the rights from Simon & Schuster.\\" The report said that Priest was unhappy with the publicity and marketing support, and quoted Priest as saying, \\"A lot of staff I had been working with had left. The new editor was clearly not in sympathy with the book, and there was no apparent inhouse support for it.\\" The article added that, in November 2002, Orion's managing director, Malcolm Edwards approached Priest and proposed that Gollancz republish the title in hardback. \\"Gollancz has always felt like a natural home to me, so I can't say how pleased I am to finally have made it after all these years,\\" Priest said.  Critical reception  In an article for New Scientist about the contestants for the 2003 Arthur C. Clarke Award, Maggie McDonald praised the novel as \\"strong competition... The twins‚ÄîRAF pilot and conscientious objector‚Äîreach cusps of change, war triumphs, peace fails or vice versa. Priest's writing is gripping, and it's one of those rare books that reveal what writing is: manner and matter twinned and entwined.\\" Elizabeth Hand described the book as \\"exquisite ... an exceptionally frightening novel whose nightmare power derives from its chilling, almost clinical evocation of an historical reality with which we are all familiar, the London Blitz... a cliffhanger narrative of dual identities, betrayals, and shifting realities, as two versions of the twins' histories‚Äîand England's, and the world's‚Äîare woven together, like strands of DNA, to form a terrifying narrative. Priest has used doubles before to great effect, in his award- winning novel The Prestige; but The Separation trumps even that tale. Its chapters linger in the mind like scenes from a Hitchcock film, impossible to shake off; like Hitchcock's work, The Separation begs for repeated readings to appreciate the cold brilliance and execution of its intricate plot fully. A masterly novel that deserves to become a classic.\\" Publishers Weekly called it a \\"subtle, unsettling alternative WWII history\\": \\"Convincingly detailed diaries, scraps of published texts, declassified transcripts and more baffle a historian who tries to reconcile different realities. The brothers themselves recognize the uncertainty of motives and actions; Joe in particular struggles to believe that he's making a better future even though he realizes how much it costs him personally. Many alternative history novels are bloodless extrapolations from mountains of data, but this one quietly builds characters you care about‚Äîthen leaves their dilemmas unresolved as they try to believe that what they have done is 'right'.\\" Pauline Morgan, reviewing the novel for SF Crowsnest.com, said, \\"This is a glorious book to read‚Äînot for nothing was Christopher Priest included in the line-up of Britain's best young novelists some years ago. The Separation does what so few books do these days, whatever genre they are written in; it encourages the reader to think.\\" Awards The Separation won the 2002 BSFA Award and the 2003 Arthur C. Clarke Award. It was a finalist for the 2002 Sidewise Award for best long-form alternate history, and the 2003 John W. Campbell Memorial Award.

Background O'Sullivan first learned boxing under his father, Michael, a Toronto bus driver. His first coach was Ken Hamilton. His next teacher was Peter Wylie, a member of the Toronto police department who was a specialist in defusing bombs. He trained at a warehouse in Cabbagetown. Amateur highlights *1981 World Amateur Champion *1981 Canadian Athlete of the Year Olympics and controversy Leading up the 1984 Olympics, O'Sullivan and fellow Canadian Willie de Wit were both favoured to win the gold medals in their classes: de Wit as a heavyweight and O'Sullivan as a light middleweight. In the gold medal bout with Frank Tate, O‚ÄôSullivan took Tate to two standing-eight-counts in the second round (and nearly a third as the round ended), but the judges unanimously gave the decision to Tate. O'Sullivan dominated the second round; however, four of the judges (Keith Walker of New Zealand, Han Dong Jin of South Korea, Noureddine Addala of Tunisia and Muili Ojo of Nigeria) gave Tate the round by the slim margin of 20-19. Tate was booed when the gold medal was draped around his neck. Tate had won in a 5-0 decision and even his coach, Emanuel Steward, admitted O'Sullivan may have won. Michigan Athletes have made Olympic history O'Sullivan, who himself had benefited from a controversial decision against Christophe Tiozzo in the semifinals, was gracious in defeat and called the outcome \\"unfortunate\\". His results were: *1st round bye *Defeated Mohamed Halibi (Lebanon) RSC 2 *Defeated Ahn Dal-Ho (South Korea) RSC 1 *Defeated Rod Douglas (Great Britain) 5-0 *Defeated Christophe Tiozzo (France) 5-0 *Lost to Frank Tate (United States) 0-5 Pro career O'Sullivan began his professional career that same year and won his first 11 bouts in the welterweight division. He lost in his 12th fight to future titlist Simon Brown by TKO in the 3rd in 1986 in Toronto's Exhibition Place. The bout was televised nationally in the United States by NBC. O'Sullivan injured his right hand in the first round, but he was clearly outclassed by the more experienced Brown. O'Sullivan later underwent surgery to repair torn knuckle joints. O'Sullivan quit boxing in 1988 after consecutive defeats to Luis Santana and Donovan Boucher, but he launched a pair of short-lived comebacks in 1991 and 1996. He retired in 1997 with a record of 23-5-0, with 16 knockouts. Four of his five career defeats were by knockout. Life after boxing In May, 2007, O'Sullivan's apartment was broken into and the thieves made off with nine rings. They included: a world championship ring with a diamond signifying a second title ‚Äî he won in both 1981 and 1983; rings from the Commonwealth Games; one from his high school, St. Mike‚Äôs, in Toronto; a Canadian championship ring; a cheap childhood ring bearing his initials, S.O.S.; and a claddagh ring, bearing an Irish symbol of two hands clutching a heart topped with a crown. Since retiring from boxing, he has been diagnosed with brain damage, as a cumulative result of blows to the head during his celebrated boxing career.

He made his first on-screen appearance on 28 May 1992 and he departed on 13 March 1996. Casting In 1992, actor Dieter Brummer successfully auditioned for the part of Shane. Brummer was fifteen years old and had been studying drama at high school. Brummer has said the recognition was instant and admitted he found the attention \\"quite bizarre\\". In 1995, Brummer quit the serial after he decided Shane's story had come to its natural conclusion. He also admitted he had become bored of the role and working with the same cast members. Speaking of his departure, Brummer stated: \\"I know there's life after Home And Away and I'm not afraid of it. Now it's time it's time to move on.\\" He filmed his final scenes in December 1995, with Shane's departure airing in early 1996. Character development When he was first introduced into the serial he was portrayed as a \\"bad boy\\". Brummer said he was fun to play because \\"he was a bad boy - stealing cars and setting fire to things.\\" Brummer felt that Shane's relationship with Angel turned him into a \\"nancy boy\\" and a \\"wuss\\". He also thought the changes to the character were negative and said \\"You don't even talk to anyone else. There's no interaction with other characters.\\" Brummer has said that Shane had \\"a beginning, a middle and an end\\" portrayed throughout his duration. In the buildup to Shane's exit storyline he is involved in a motor bike accident. He lies in a coma and has to have his spleen removed. Dr. Kelly Watson (Katrina Hobbs) performed the operation, he dies from septicaemia when he cuts himself on a nail. Hobbs said she was given the nickname \\"Doctor death\\" for her role in his demise. Melissa George who plays on-screen wife Angel Parrish, said the scenes involving his death were \\"gut-wrenching stuff\\". Storylines Shane makes his mark on Summer Bay by breaking into Donald Fisher's (Norman Coburn) house, where he is found by his older brother, Nick (Bruce Roberts) who lives there with his fianc√© Lucinda Croft (Dee Smart), Donald's niece. Shane discovers Lucinda is cheating on Nick with her ex-boyfriend Ryan Lee (Alistair MacDougall) and begins a campaign against them, culminating in Shane sinking Ryan's car. Shane quickly befriends Damian Roberts (Matt Doran) and leads him into trouble. The boys compete for the affections of new student Kelly Chan (Theresa Wong) and ultimately Shane wins her, causing a rift. Kelly leaves and the boys are friends again. Shane makes an enemy of Peter \\"Tug\\" O'Neale (Tristan Bancks), who had previously given Damian a hard time and Tug later frames Shane for burglary. Shane's name is eventually cleared after serving several weeks in a detention centre. Angel Brooks sells Shane some tickets to see Frente! but they turn out to be fake and he hunts her down. It later emerges Angel is homeless and she soon moves in with Donald, Nick and Shane. There is a great deal of animosity between Shane and Angel at first but they become a couple after sharing a kiss. When Shane is cast as the lead in a local musical opposite Tug's girlfriend Sarah Thompson (Laura Vasquez), he uses this opportunity to wind up Tug. On the night of the performance, Shane overdoes the kissing scene leading Tug to get up from his seat, storm the stage and punch Shane. The Animosity between Shane and Tug later thaws. Shane is shocked when he reads Angel's file on a computer during work experience at Yabbie Creek police station where he is shadowing his brother Nick. It transpires she fell pregnant at 14 and gave birth to a son, Dylan and surrendered custody to Dylan's father Paul Harris (Ramsay Everingham) and his mother, Anne (Fay Kelton). Shane agrees to go with Angel to track down Dylan after much persuasion. After some difficulty, Shane eventually bonds with Dylan. When Jack Wilson (Daniel Amalm) arrives in the Bay, he makes a play for Angel, which puts Shane's nose out of joint. To fix Jack, Shane gives him false directions to Angel's room. Jack climbs in the window and attempts to get into bed with Angel only to find he is in Donald's room. Shane proposes and Angel accepts despite many people thinking they are too young and have not finished Year 12. Nick receives an overseas posting and Shane is distraught at his brother's departure and becomes moody. Shane's mood is not helped when his mother Ros (Angela Punch McGregor) arrives shortly after his father dies. Things come to ahead when Shane feels Ros is interfering in his relationship with Angel and asks her to leave. The wedding is pushed back when Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) accidentally runs over Angel, leaving her temporarily paralysed and Shane upset. The wedding goes ahead and Angel is guided down the aisle by Donald and the couple take their vows. Shane and Angel later move into an old house which they renovate. Shannon Reed (Isla Fisher) develops a schoolgirl crush on Shane and uses the opportunity to babysit Dylan to get close to him. After Shane rebuffs Shannon when she kisses him, She later tells Angel she and Shane have been having an affair which Shane denies but Angel leaves taking Dylan with her and is later caught in a seaplane crash with local teacher Teresa Lynch (Diane Craig). Shane joins the search party and Angel, Dylan and Teresa are found. One night while entertaining guests, Shane goes out to pick up some ice cream but is knocked off his motorbike and left for dead. He undergoes a splenectomy and makes a recovery. To celebrate Shane and Angel's first anniversary, the couple and Dylan take a trip to the headland. Shane feels sick and collapses, Angel screams for help but Shane dies. The cause of his death is septicaemia caused by an infection that never really healed by cutting it on wire. Shane is cremated and his ashes are scattered at sea and several months later, Angel gives birth to a baby girl, named after her father. Reception At the 1996 Inside Soap Awards Shane was named the most missed soap opera character.

The registered agent's address may also be where the state sends the paperwork for the periodic renewal of the business entity's charter (if required). The registered agent for a business entity may be an officer or employee of the company, or a third party, such as the organization's lawyer or a service company. Failure to properly maintain a registered agent can affect a company negatively. Services provided Most businesses are not individuals but instead business entities such as corporations or limited liability companies (LLCs). This is because there are substantive (and substantial) liability protections as well as tax advantages to being \\"incorporated\\" as opposed to being \\"self-employed\\". If a registered agent fails to perform their function, it can have dire consequences for the business entity. For example, if a customer fell inside a store and sued the store, and the store's registered agent failed to notify the business entity of a summons to appear in court to respond to the lawsuit, then when the case went to trial, nobody would appear to defend the store and the customer would win by a default judgment. Additionally, the store would likely not be able to get the judgment overturned on appeal because they had been properly served. This is one of the most common reasons that business entities generally will utilize a third party as their registered agent be it a commercial service company, an attorney, or in some cases, a CPA. The person at a business entity that maintains contact with the registered agent is normally the corporate secretary or governance officer. Designation A registered agent is designated by a business entity by completing a form and filing it with the appropriate government agency, normally a state's Secretary of State's office. Initial designation In most all cases, the registered agent for a business entity is assigned in the formation documents filed in a jurisdiction when the entity is originally created.E.g., Code of Maryland, Corporations and Associations Article, ¬ß 4A-204(a)(3) requires the articles of organization of a limited liability company to include \\"the name and address of its resident agent\\". For example, a person forming a corporation in the State of Nevada or Delaware, would designate the registered agent along with the agent's address on the articles of incorporation filed with the Nevada Secretary of State or Delaware Secretary of State respectively. If the agent cannot sign the articles to be filed, some states such as Nevada provide that the registered agent may be designated using a separate \\"Registered Agent Acceptance\\" form with the appropriate acceptance and signature.Example of \\"Registered Agent Acceptance\\" form (Nevada) A representative of the business or the individual accepting responsibility as registered agent must sign to accept the responsibility of acting as agent. In most states it is a crime to knowingly file a false document with the office of the Secretary of State, although the penalties vary widely. For example, in Nevada it is a Class \\"D\\" felony to forge this signature, but in Michigan it is only a misdemeanor. Change of agent A business entity might at some point want to change its previously designated registered agent to another party. This is accomplished by obtaining a form from the secretary of state where the business entity is registered, completing said form, and filing it with that state office along with any requisite fees which may vary from state to state. In some cases the required form may simply be a dedicated change of registered agent form, and in other cases, such as in Delaware, an actual amendment to the articles of the business entity must be filed.Delaware Change of Agent FAQ Locating registered agents Information about persons or entities that are available to act as registered agents in a given state may be maintained by the state's Secretary of State office. Most states also offer free online database searches to identify a business entity's registered agent. Some state business entity laws name the Secretary of State's office or business entity filing office as the registered agent of last resort, in the event the named registered agent can't be found. By law, service may be made on the office if the entities registered agent can not be found. However, the plaintiff must demonstrate that it made a good faith effort to service the registered agent before it may serve the Secretary of State. The state laws vary in how to complete service on the Secretary of State and the amount of fees charged. Some of the states that may have this statutory provision are listed below. MoRAA eliminated this provision but some of the states that adopted MoRAA maintained this provision. Regulation Most jurisdictions in the United States require that any business entity that is formed or doing business within their borders designate and maintain a \\"registered agent\\".e.g., Code of Virginia, Section 13.1-634; Pennsylvania law refers only to the \\"agent who maintains the registered office for the corporation\\", 15 Pa.Consol.Stat. ¬ß108(a), but this person is customarily referred to as the \\"agent\\". This person may be known as the \\"resident agent\\"e.g., Code of Maryland, Corporations and Associations Article, Section ¬ß 2-108. or \\"statutory agent\\",e.g., Arizona Revised Statutes, Section 10-501. depending on the laws of the individual jurisdiction in which the business entity is registered. The purpose of a registered agent is to provide a legal address (not a P.O. Box) within that jurisdiction where there are persons available during normal business hours to facilitate legal service of process being served in the event of a legal action or lawsuit.e.g., California Corporations Code, Section 1701. Generally, the registered agent is also the person to whom the state government sends all official documents required each year for tax and legal purposes, such as franchise tax notices and annual report forms. It is the registered agent's job to forward these suit documents and notices to the entity itself.e.g., Code of Virginia, Section 13.1-634(B). Registered agents generally will also notify business entities if their state government filing status is in \\"good standing\\" or not. The reason that these notifications are a desired function of a registered agent is that it is difficult for a business entity to keep track of legislative changes and report due dates for multiple jurisdictions given the disparate laws of different states. The failure to maintain a registered agent may cause a jurisdiction to revoke a business‚Äôs corporate or LLC legal status, imposition of penalty fees on the entity, or both. Who may serve as a registered agent Different states have different requirements for registered agents. Typically, the agent must be a natural person resident of the state in question or, in states that allow entities to serve as registered agents, an entity having a business office within the state and authorized to do business in the state.E.g., New Hampshire Revised Statutes ¬ß 293-A:5.01(1)(i): \\"An individual who resides in this state . . . \\" or an entity.E.g., Virginia Code ¬ß 13.1-634. In some states a business entity is legally allowed to act as its own registered agent, if at least one of its officers is a resident of the state, but other jurisdictions may require that a business entity designate a third party as its registered agent.E.g., D.C. Code Section 29-101.10. Because most states permit one business entity to serve as a registered agent for others, some businesses exist to serve that exact function, charging a fee to act as the registered agent for hundreds or thousands of businesses in a given state. Model Registered Agents Act The Model Registered Agents Act (MoRAA) is an effort spearheaded by the American Bar Association Business Law Section and the International Association of Commercial Administrators (IACA) ‚Äì Business Organization Section (BOS) to standardize business entity laws as they relate to annual reports, registered agents and other laws and forms used to file business entities. The act also creates two distinct classes of registered agent: \\"commercial\\" and \\"non-commercial.\\" The National Conference of Commissions on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) organized a drafting committee composed of commissions, ABA, and IACA representatives who drafted the act's language. NCCUSL adopted MoRAA at its 2006 annual meeting. It was amended in 2011. Eleven US jurisdictions (Arkansas, District of Columbia, Idaho, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) have since adopted the model act, and Delaware did not adopt the act, but did adopt the \\"commercial registered agent\\" provision. The problem this effort seeks to alleviate is that disparate laws, filing requirements, and forms in all of the US jurisdictions where business entities are filed creates a quagmire for any company seeking to register to do business in those jurisdictions. By adopting a common set of laws, the Model Registered Agents Act seeks to create a uniform and simple process of filing and maintaining a business entity in any jurisdiction adopting it. * Alaska * Arkansas * California * Delaware * Idaho * Maine * Mississippi * Montana * Nevada * New Hampshire * North Dakota * Pennsylvania * Wyoming See also * List of Secretaries of State, who in the United States provide information about available registered agents in each state References Agency law United States business law Region-specific legal occupations ","title":"Registered agent"},{"id":"6335919","text":"Since the Iranian revolution, Iranian female solo vocalists are permitted to perform for female audiences.

He first appeared during the episode airing on 18 March 1999, played by Matt Juarez in a guest role and then returned as a regular character on 26 April 2000, now played by Chris Egan, and departed on 12 September 2003. Aaron Puckeridge also played Nick in flashbacks in 2003. Casting In a live chat session on the official Home and Away website, Egan answered several questions from fans. He spoke of his experiences of being cast as Nick. \\"It's great, I have a lot of fun, it's like a big family, I learn a lot from them.\\" When asked about working with co-star Kate Garven, who played Jade Sutherland, Egan said \\"She's great, we have a lot of fun together, a lot of fun playing boyfriend and girlfriend, hard not to have a laugh between scenes. We have a lot of fun.\\" Egan also praised co-stars Brett Hicks-Maitland and Zac Drayson, who plays Nick's on-screen brother, Will. Egan stated he would like to appear in films after leaving the serial and mentioned that filming overseas in London and shooting scenes for Home and Away video spinoff Home and Away: Secrets and the City were among his favorite experiences. Storylines Nick is the younger brother of Will (Zac Drayson) and Hayley Smith (Bec Cartwright). Like Hayley, he was taken into care and showed little interest in Will's plan for them all to settle in Summer Bay, choosing to stay with foster parents even after Hayley had gone to join Will. Nick is first seen when he is fleeing from Johnno, a drug dealer and the leader of a biker gang, whom he owes a large sum of money to. Nick runs to get help from his siblings and is beaten up by Johnno, who considers the debt paid. Nick's foster parents are initially reluctant to take him back following the revelation but after Will and Hayley coax them, Nick returns home. Nick's father Ken (Anthony Phelan) returns after fighting an alcohol problem, he petitions for Nick to return home to reunite the family. Nick is not very keen on the idea. He meets Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger), Will and Hayley's foster mother and Ken's new partner. He feels that Ken is trying to replace his mother Eve (Robyn Gibbes) and Nick is upset further when he learns Ken and Irene are to be engaged after Ken proposes. Nick soon befriends Duncan Stewart (Brendan McKensy) and they begin causing havoc together. When Nick is accused of throwing stones at Duncan's aunt, Celia (Fiona Spence), they get into a fight but later reconcile their friendship and focus their attentions on the newly arrived Sutherland twins Jade (Kate Garven) and Kirsty (Christie Hayes), who are in their year at school. Duncan dates Jade while Nick dates Kirsty. After Nick saves Irene from being attacked by Eve, who has since left a mental hospital, he gives her and Ken his blessing. Ken is later killed when a car he is working on crushes him, leaving Nick and the family devastated. Nick feels isolated and things are not helped when Irene becomes distant and Will takes an authoritarian role. He becomes worried that Irene will not want him, Will and Hayley now Ken has died but she reassures him otherwise. When Nick runs away one night and he hides out at Ken's garage, which is about to be sold and destroyed, he is visited his father in a dream who tells him that the garage would probably have had to close due to its location and if he returned home, everything would work out. Nick wakes up and returns home to reconcile. Nick's friendship with Duncan comes to an end when Duncan's bad behaviour spirals out of control. Nick soon becomes closer to Jade and she feels the same but rejects him when he offers to break up with Kirsty to be with her as she feels it will damage her own relationship with he sister. Kirsty, however, ends things first as she has feelings for Seb Miller (Mitch Firth). Nick briefly dates Simone Harris but it fizzles out when Simone insults Jade. After Nick returns from a visit to London, he and Jade finally get together. When Will asks Nick to be his best man at his wedding to Gypsy Nash (Kimberley Cooper), he is pleased but panics when he realises he has lost the ring. In order to fund a replacement, he sells his games console and is annoyed when it emerges Will has taken the ring to have engraved. Will suggests that Nick gives the replacement ring to Jade. Shortly after Will and Gypsy leave, Nick clashes with Irene's son Nathan Roberts (Craig Ball) who has recently been released from prison. During a Year 10 class trip, The bus crashes and Nick is left with his legs trapped. Nathan assists the search party in rescuing the passengers and is able to save them before the bus explodes into flames. Following the death of local doctor, Charlotte Adams (Stephanie Chaves-Jacobsen), Nick finds Jade's phase of Living for the moment hard to take and is somewhat reluctant when she seems to want to elevate their relationship to a more physical level. Nick then gently informs her he is not ready for that step. Angie Russell (Laurie Foell), the new deputy principal at Summer Bay High begins playing mind games after Nick is found arguing with her son, Dylan. She begins flirting with Nick, causing him to obsess over her. Nick's behaviour becomes erratic when he tries to get Jade to take suggestive photos of herself. Social services are called and Irene is initially accused of abusing Nick. When Nick stands up to Angie one day in class, she begins tearing at her clothes and screaming, claiming that Nick has sexually assaulted her. Nick is then charged and vilified in town. Nick flees and hides out on a hippy farm where Jade finds him high on \\"magic mushrooms\\", and she is only just able to get him to attend court. In spite of Dylan's testimony, Nick is found guilty and expelled from Summer Bay High. Nick then begins community service at a retirement home and is forced to attend Yabbie Creek High. Jade, Kirsty and Seb work together on a video which exposes Angie's behaviour and she is fired by Principal Paris Burnett (Rhett Giles) and Nick is reinstated. Several weeks later, Angie is killed and many people, including Nick and the Sutherlands are in the frame for murder. It is later revealed Dylan killed Angie. Nick auditions for \\"The Dorm\\", a reality television show and is successful. Nick quickly discovers that one of the other contestants, Courtney (Emily Sexton), is a plant aiming to cause trouble. Courtney climbs into bed to silence Nick but the sequence is edited to make it look like they have slept together. Jade sees the footage and begins making multiple phone calls in order to vote Nick out of the show and he returns home in disgrace. Nick tells his side of the story in a newspaper interview but has a hard time convincing people that he was the innocent party. After learning of Irene's relationship with Paris, Nick steals a car and tries to leave town. Jesse McGregor (Ben Unwin) catches him but is arrested for the crime himself. He confesses once Jesse is facing a return to prison. A major American producer offers Nick a role in a film and he accepts. Nick gets his friends together one last time before leaving for Los Angeles. Reception For his portrayal of Nick, Egan was nominated for \\"Best New Male Talent\\" at the Logie Awards in 2001.

The highway extends from the White Horse Circle (U.S. Route 206 or US 206 and Route 533) in Hamilton Township to Route 71 in Spring Lake Heights. There are a few concrete bridge heads which showed that the section of CR 524 between the White Horse Circle and Allentown was in the 1930s part of State Highway Route 37.  Route description  CR 524's western terminus at the White Horse Circle View east along CR 524 in Yardville CR 524 begins at the modified White Horse Circle in the community of White Horse in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, where the route intersects US 206 and the southern terminus of CR 533\\\\. From the circle, the route heads east on two-lane undivided South Broad Street, which continues toward Trenton as part of US 206 west of the White Horse Circle. CR 524 passes homes before reaching an interchange with Interstate 195 (I-195), where the route is a four-lane divided highway maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation with a wide median. After this, the road becomes undivided and county-maintained again, passing more suburban homes and becoming a divided highway briefly again at an intersection with Boulevard/Kim Valley Road in business areas. CR 524 narrows back into a two-lane undivided road turns southeast and crosses Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Robbinsville Industrial Track line near industrial establishments. The road passes more businesses as it reaches an intersection with CR 609 and CR 672 in the community of Yardville. At this point, CR 672 continues along South Broad Street while CR 524 heads east onto Yardville- Allentown Road, intersecting Route 156 and interchanging with US 130. From this point, the road continues through a mix of residences and woodland before passing over the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). Past this bridge, the route heads into agricultural areas with some woods and homes. CR 524 eastbound curves to the right while the old alignment of the road prior to the construction of the Garden State Parkway continues straight ahead as a concrete road in Wall Township. CR 524 continues into Upper Freehold Township in Monmouth County and runs through wooded areas of residences before crossing into Allentown. The route intersects CR 28 and turns northeast onto Main Street, passing more homes. After running near Connies Millpond, CR 524 forms a concurrency with CR 539, with the two routes continuing along Main Street to a short overlap with CR 526. The road leaves Allentown for Upper Freehold Township and enters farmland as it intersects CR 526 Spur. A short distance later, CR 524/CR 539 reaches an interchange with I-195. At this point, the name of the road becomes Stage Coach Road and it forms the border between Robbinsville Township, Mercer County to the west and Upper Freehold Township, Monmouth County to the east briefly before CR 524 splits from CR 539 by turning east and fully entering Upper Freehold Township, retaining the Stage Coach Road name. CR 524 continues through open agricultural areas with a few homes, intersecting CR 43. The road heads into a mix of farms, woods, and residences as it enters Millstone Township and comes to a junction with CR 571. At this point, CR 571 joins CR 524 and the two routes make a sharp turn to the southeast into wooded residential areas, turning east at an intersection with Red Valley Road/Spring Road. CR 571 splits from CR 524 by turning south on Millstone Road, with CR 524 heading northeast and entering areas of farmland. The route heads into wooded areas of homes before reaching an intersection with CR 537, at which point CR 524 joins CR 537. The two routes head northeast along Monmouth Road, forming the border between Millstone Township to the northwest and Freehold Township to the southeast. Upon crossing CR 527, the road forms the border between Manalapan Township and Freehold Township as passes near farms and homes. Eastern terminus of CR 524 at Route 71 in Spring Lake Heights CR 524 splits from CR 537 by turning east onto Elton Road, fully entering Freehold Township. On this road, the route passes through agricultural areas before heading through suburban residential subdivisions, becoming Elton-Adelphia Road as it comes to intersections with CR 23 and US 9. From here, CR 524 heads southeast onto Adelphia Road and heads into Howell Township and passes more housing developments. The road continues into residential areas with a few farms before CR 524A splits off, running farther south of CR 524. The route heads east through more wooded areas of residences before crossing the inactive Conrail Shared Assets Operations Freehold Industrial Track and entering Farmingdale. The road passes homes and businesses before coming to the CR 35 junction, where CR 524 turns southeast onto Main Street. In the center of Farmingdale, CR 547 joins CR 524 from the north and the two routes pass businesses before crossing the Conrail Shared Assets Operations Southern Secondary. The road makes a turn to the south and crosses back into Howell Township, intersecting CR 18. The two routes continues south through wooded areas of homes and businesses on Lakewood-Farmingdale Road before the CR 524A intersects from the west. At this point, CR 524 splits from CR 547 by turning east onto Allaire Road and entering densely forested areas of Allaire State Park, passing under I-195 before entering Wall Township. The road turns southeast as it passes Allaire Village and intersects CR 30. As CR 524 approaches the Garden State Parkway, the route splits from Allaire Road by heading southeast on Atlantic Avenue and crossing over the parkway, with Allaire Road becoming a dead end road on either side of the Garden State Parkway. After the bridge, CR 524 turns northeast onto Allenwood Road, with CR 524 Spur continuing along Atlantic Avenue. The route turns east again and resumes along Allaire Road, passing homes before intersecting Route 34 at the Allenwood Circle. The road continues through a mix of fields, woods, and residences before passing Osborne Pond. CR 524 reaches intersections with CR 47 and Route 35 in business areas before crossing into Spring Lake Heights. The route passes several homes before coming to its eastern terminus at Route 71, where the road continues east as Ludlow Avenue toward the Atlantic Ocean.  History  From Our House Tavern, a short distance west of Farmingdale, to Squankum, was maintained as part of the Farmingdale and Squankum Turnpike, chartered in 1866. Its charter allowed it to extend its turnpike to Manasquan. Between 1927 and 1953, the road between Trenton and Allentown was once signed as part of Route 37. Concrete bridge heads confirm this, and USGS topographical maps indicate that the road was signed as such until at least 1948.

The highway extends 3.74 miles (6.02 km) as Squankum-Yellowbrook Road in Howell Township. The highway acts as a by-pass of the borough of Farmingdale. For CR 524A's entire run, the speed limit is 45 mph (72 km/h). Though the state's straight line diagram of the route states that the road is east-west, CR 524A is signed by Monmouth County as a north-south route. CR 524A begins at a signalized intersection with its parent route, CR 524 west of Farmingdale. It turns to the south-east, the direction it follows for most of its existence. At mile marker 1.63, CR 524A intersects CR 21 (Southard Avenue), near Howell High School. It passes Howell Golf Course, crosses the abandoned Freehold-Jamesburg railroad line, and comes to an end at its parent route, CR 524 and CR 547 just north of Interstate 195's exit 31.

The highway extends from Allenwood Road (CR 524) in Wall Township to Broad Street (Monmouth CR 20) in Manasquan and is known as Atlantic Avenue for its entire length. CR 524 Spur begins at an intersection with CR 524 just east of its overpass over the Garden State Parkway in southern Wall Township. It heads southeast for about a before reaching a skewed intersection with Allenwood- Lakewood Road (CR 21) and Ramshorn Drive. CR 524 Spur turns east and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Route 34. After a slight curve at Tiltons Corner Road, CR 524 Spur continues east past numerous businesses and an apartment complex. A traffic circle is at its intersection with Route 35. Past the traffic circle, the route enters Manasquan and ends at a T-intersection with Broad Street, next to the Manasquan High School.

Description  Auxiliary crane ships are converted commercial container ships, equipped with pedestal cranes capable of lifting containers and other cargo. These are used to unload cargo from their own holds as well from other vessels at port facilities which do not have their own cargo handling capability. These ships give the Military Sealift Command the ability to deliver cargo to locations that would otherwise be inaccessible or difficult to deliver cargo to in a timely manner. This increases the Command's capabilities in responding to needs worldwide, both in locations which are underdeveloped as well as those that have suffered destruction from conflict or natural disasters. The ships retain the ability to carry more than 300 standard containers.  Service  The first crane ship was completed as such in 1984, and a total of 10 vessels were converted through 1997. All were former commercial vessels. Builders which participated in the program were Defoe Shipbuilding Company in Bay City, Michigan, Dillingham Ship Repair in Portland, Oregon, Norshipco in Norfolk, Virginia, Tampa Shipyard in Tampa, Florida, and Keith Ship Repair in New Orleans, Louisiana. Within the Military Sealift Command, the ships serve as part of the Ready Reserve Force. Five crane ships were deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1990 and 1991, while a single example served as a temporary Army prepositioning ship in 1994. Four crane ships were transferred to the National Defense Reserve Fleet on 28 July 2006.

It was the second game by the company, after Pong (1972), which marked the beginning of the commercial video game industry. In the game, two players each control a rocket ship, with the goal of being the first to move their ship from the bottom of the screen to the top. Along the way are asteroids, which the players must avoid. Space Race was the first racing arcade video game and the first game with a goal of crossing the screen while avoiding obstacles. Development of Space Race began in Summer 1972 under the name Asteroid by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, based on ideas by him and co- founder Ted Dabney. The final design was done by Dabney, possibly with assistance by Bushnell and Pong designer Allan Alcorn. The game was planned to be quick to create to fulfill an earlier contract with Bally Midway. The engineering and prototyping was done by Alcorn; after it was completed and the design given to Midway to be released as Asteroid, Atari produced its own nearly identical version as Space Race. Fifty Space Race cabinets were produced using a fiberglass design by George Faraco before the rest of the production was switched to a cheaper standard cabinet. Space Race was not commercially successful; Bushnell has stated that it was much less popular than Pong. Midway held that the release of Space Race violated Atari's contract with them for Asteroid, and the companies agreed for Atari to forfeit royalty payments for the game. Gameplay Gameplay of Space Race, with the timer near the start of the game and player 2 in the lead. Space Race is a two-player arcade game. In the game, the two players each control a spaceship, which they fly from the bottom of the screen to the top. Along the way are dashes representing asteroids moving across the screen from left to right, which the players must avoid. Movement controls are limited to moving the spaceship up or down; if the player's ship is hit by an asteroid it disappears for a few seconds before reappearing at the bottom again. The game displays a starfield in the background, as well as each player's score, which increases whenever a player makes it to the top first. Each game is for a set amount of time, represented by a line in the bottom middle of the screen that shortens during the game, with the winner being the player with the higher score when time runs out. Each game costs a quarter. Machines can be set to play one or two rounds per game, and the time per round is adjustable per machine over a range from 45 seconds to 3 minutes. Development Development of Space Race began soon after the founding of Atari in summer 1972 under the name Asteroid. Co-founders Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney had the initial idea for the game while developing the 1971 Computer Space, the first arcade video game, but felt the more complicated Computer Space was a better first game. After leaving Nutting Associates and founding Atari in May 1972, Bushnell spent a few days designing Asteroid, but soon had to drop the project to focus on running the company. After the release of Pong, Atari's first game, development resumed on the title in Spring 1973. Dabney has claimed credit for the game's final design, though Pong designer Allan Alcorn has stated that he and Bushnell may have been involved as well. Asteroid, codenamed VP-2, was designed to be a racing game that would be simple to create to fulfill an earlier contract with Bally Midway; Atari had initially offered Pong during its development to fulfill the contract, but had been rejected. The company was also interested in producing a very different game from their previous success, as they felt that innovative design was what would separate them from their competitors, which they saw as flooding the market with Pong clones rather than making new video games. The engineering and prototyping for Asteroid was done by Alcorn. The game is encoded entirely in discrete electronic components, like Atari's earlier games, and unlike later computer- based arcade games; the graphics are all simple line elements with the exception of the spacecraft, which are generated based on diodes on the circuit board arranged in the shape of half of a ship to represent the shape they create. That half ship is mirrored on the screen, similar to the diode array in Computer Space, which generated eight directions of a rotating ship with a mirrored four images. The game was completed quickly, and Alcorn soon moved on to Atari's third game, Gotcha. When the game was complete, the design was given to Midway to sell under that name, only for Atari to produce a nearly identical version itself titled Space Race, which was released on July 16, 1973. Namco released the game in Japan due to their acquisition of Atari's Japanese division, releasing in July 1974. A fiberglass Space Race cabinet was designed for the game by Atari's product designer, George Faraco. The tall, angular cabinet, reminiscent of the fiberglass cabinet for Computer Space, was the first to display the Atari logo. The cabinet design was distinctive enough that Bushnell considered using it for Pong as well, but the production costs proved too high and only 50 units were made before the design was dropped and Space Race switched to a more traditional rectangular cabinet. The final cabinet stands nearly 5 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds. Bushnell later stated that the molds to make the fiberglass cabinets cost US$2000 and could only make one per day due to the complicated shape, and Atari felt the cost did not justify buying enough molds to make a full production run in a reasonable amount of time. The final Space Race cabinet was reused later that same year for Pong Doubles, a four-player version of Pong. Legacy Poster for Astro Race (1973), showing the same gameplay and visuals as Space Race Space Race was not commercially successful; Nolan Bushnell has described it as \\"not as successful as Pong by a wide margin\\", and Ralph Baer claims that it sold around 1,500 units. It did inspire a clone game, Taito's 1973 Astro Race, and according to Bushnell also inspired an unsuccessful clone version by Nutting Associates. Midway felt that the release of Space Race violated their contract with Atari for Asteroid, and the two companies agreed in exchange to drop Atari's three percent royalty cut for Asteroid machines. Despite Space Races prominence as Atari's second game and the first after Pong, the 1973 arcade video game market was largely dominated by Pong clones; while Pong was the fourth arcade video game ever produced, Space Race was approximately the fourteenth, with nine Pong clones between them and mostly only other clones filling out the rest of the year's releases. Space Race was the first arcade racing video game, as well as the first game with a goal of crossing the screen while avoiding obstacles, though a few racing games had been released in 1972 for the Magnavox Odyssey home video game console. Later games in that genre are the arcade game Frogger and the Atari 2600 Freeway, both from 1981. A similarly-titled, expanded version of Space Race was published by ANALOG Software in 1981 for the Atari 8-bit family of computers as Race in Space.

Lithograph The Royal College of Chemistry (RCC) was a college originally based on Oxford Street in central London, England. It operated between 1845 and 1872. The original building was designed by the English architect James Lockyer in 1846 with the foundation stone being laid by Prince Albert.\\"The Late Mr James Lockyer, architect\\", The Builder, 19 June 1875, p. 544. The College was set up to teach practical chemistry. Many politicians donated funds to establish the college, including Benjamin Disraeli, William Gladstone and Robert Peel. It was also supported by Prince Albert. The first director was August Wilhelm von Hofmann. Frederick Augustus Abel studied under von Hofmann. Sir William Crookes, Edward Divers and J. A. R. Newlands also attended the college. The young William Henry Perkin studied and worked at the college under von Hofmann, but resigned his position after discovering the first synthetic dye, mauveine, in 1856. Perkin's discovery was prompted by his work with von Hofmann on the substance aniline, derived from coal tar, and it was this breakthrough which sparked the synthetic dye industry, a boom which some historians have labelled 'the second chemical revolution'. The college was merged into the Royal School of Mines in 1853. It was the first constituent college of Imperial College London and eventually became the Imperial College Chemistry Department.

The inability of the motorcycle competitors to climb the steep primary A18 Snaefell Mountain Road section of the course forced the organisers to use a section of the Gordon Bennett Trial course.

Named corners TT Race Marshal Signal Box on the A18 Mountain Road looking north towards Guthrie's Memorial and the Point of Ayre It is estimated that there are over 200 corners on the Mountain Course with about 60 named corners, some named after individuals. The first corner to be named after a competitor was Edges Corner in 1920 on the primary A21 Johnny Watterson's Lane on the Mountain Course between Cronk-ny-Mona and the A22 Ballanard Road in Douglas used for racing between 1911 and 1922. Part of the TT Course was renamed Brandish Corner after Walter Brandish crashed in the right-hand gutter while trying to pass another competitor at Upper Hillberry Corner (previously Telegraph Hill) between Creg- ny-Baa and Hillberry Corner and broke a leg during practice for the 1923 TT races.Isle of Man Weekly Times pp3 dated 9 June 1923 During an early morning practice session for the 1927 TT, Archie Birkin swerved in Kirk Michael village to avoid a fish-van travelling to Peel on the primary A3 road, collided with a wall and was killed. The corner was then named Birkin's Bend, and afterwards, from 1928, practice sessions for the TT races and Manx Grand Prix were held on closed roads. The Ballameanagh Corner between the 11th Milestone and the 12th Milestone was renamed Handley's Corner after Wal Handley, riding a Rudge motorcycle, crashed during lap 1 of the 1932 TT Senior race, sustained a back injury and subsequently retired from the race. In 1939 a stone memorial to Jimmie Guthrie was built at The Cutting on the A18 Snaefell Mountain Road and the S-bend corner was renamed Guthrie's Memorial. Following a crash during an evening practice session for the 1950 Isle of Man TT races by Bill Doran between Ballig Bridge and Laurel Bank, the corner was named Doran's Bend. A stone shelter in a style of a small mountain Alpine Lodge was built in 1955 as a memorial to Les Graham, the inaugural 500 cc World Champion solo motorcyclist, on the A18 Mountain Road.Isle of Man Examiner pp9 dated 10 June 1955 The corner is named Les Graham Memorial or sometimes referred to as the Bungalow Bridge. The uphill section of the Mountain Course from the Bungalow to the highest point of the course near Brandywell was named in 1981 as Hailwood's Rise, in memory of Mike Hailwood, the former world motorcycle champion, and the highest point of the course preceding the Brandywell road junction was named Hailwood's Height.Isle of Man TT Festival Fortnight 1‚Äì12 June 1981 ‚Äì Official Souvenir Programme page 17 Isle of Man Tourist Board The Auto-Cycle Union (1981) J.M.

Safety Between 1911 and 2018 there have been 258 rider competitor fatalities during official practices or races on the Isle of Man TT Mountain Course (this number includes the riders killed during the Manx Grand Prix, and Clubman TT race series of the late 1940s/1950s). The first fatality on the TT Course was at Glen Helen during practice for the 1911 TT when Victor Surridge, a works Rudge-Whitworth rider, crashed heavily and died of his injuries.Isle of Man Weekly Times page 9 dated 1 July 1911 This was also possibly the first death in the Isle of Man of a person in a motorcycle or other road-vehicle accident.TT Topics and Tales page 69 by David Wright ‚Äì Amulree Publications (4 April 2006) The A3 Castletown to Ramsey road approaching Douglas Road Corner, Kirk Michael with safety air fencing on the outside of the bend The compulsory use of crash helmets for the 1914 TT races was the result of a fatal accident to Frank Bateman near Creg-ny-Baa during the 1913 Senior TT race;Isle of Man Examiner page 8 dated 7 June 1913 similarly, the first introduction of a flag to signify the end of a race was as a result of the death of Fred Walker at the finish line of the 1914 Junior TT race.Isle of Man Examiner page 3 dated 30 May 1914 During an early morning practice session for the 1927 Isle of Man TT, Archie Birkin was killed instantly when he swerved to avoid a fish-van travelling to Peel and collided with a wall at Rhencullen.Isle of Man Weekly Times page 7 11 June 1927 The corner in Kirk Michael on the A3 primary road where the accident occurred was renamed 'Birkin's Bend.'

Route description CR 523 northbound past CR 605 in Delaware Township CR 523 begins at an intersection with Route 29 (Main Street) in Stockton, Hunterdon County, heading northeast on Stockton-Flemington Road through wooded residential areas. The road leaves Stockton for Delaware Township and enters a mix of farms and woods with some homes. The route intersects CR 605 before crossing CR 604 in the residential community of Sergeantsville. CR 523 passes through more rural areas as it comes to a brief concurrency with CR 579. After CR 579 splits to the south, the route enters Raritan Township and enters rural areas with increasing residential subdivisions. CR 523 intersects Route 12 at Dvoor's Circle and crosses into Flemington a short distance later, becoming municipally-maintained Mine Street, which is lined with homes. CR 523 turns north onto Park Avenue, passing more residences along with a few businesses. The route heads northeast on Walter E. Foran Boulevard, crossing back into Raritan Township. At this point, CR 523 resumes county maintenance and becomes a divided highway as it passes residential subdivisions, narrowing back into an undivided road as it turns east and intersects Route 31. After this intersection, the route becomes unnamed as it passes commercial areas before passing farms and making a turn to the north, becoming county maintained again. The road passes through a mix of homes and businesses parks before heading near more farmland, running a short distance to the west of Norfolk Southern's Lehigh Line. After intersecting CR 612, CR 523 turns east onto Flemington-Whitehouse Road and passes over the Lehigh Line, at which point it runs between the South Branch Raritan River to the north and an industrial facility to the south. The road crosses the South Branch Raritan River into Readington Township, where it turns northeast and then north into a mix of woods, farms, and residential neighborhoods. The route curves to the north-northeast as it crosses CR 629 and continues to the CR 620 intersection near more residential areas. CR 523 comes to the community of Whitehouse Station, where the route becomes Main Street as it passes homes, crossing NJ Transit's Raritan Valley Line near White House station.

After the US 22 overlap, CR 523 continues north on two-lane undivided Oldwick Road, entering wooded areas with some homes. The road is briefly a four-lane divided highway as it comes to an interchange providing access to the UNICOM Science and Technology Park. The road becomes two lanes and undivided again as it crosses into Tewksbury Township and reaches an interchange with I-78, with a park and ride lot located at the southwest corner. Past this interchange, the route passes a mix of fields and woods with a few residences before coming to the southern terminus of CR 517.

First Dallas Herald (1849-1885)  The first permanent settler of Dallas, John Neely Bryan, settled there in 1841. The first local newspaper appeared in 1849, when James Wellington Latimer Latimer, James Wellington (known as ‚ÄúWeck,‚Äù ‚ÄúWake,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMark‚Äù) established a weekly newspaper, the Dallas Herald. Latimer and William Wallace had purchased the Texas Times, published in Paris, Texas, and moved it to Dallas to become the Herald. The first few issues may have appeared under the name the Cedar Snag, but the nameplate read Dallas Herald by December 1849. Latimer became sole owner and editor when Wallace retired in 1850. John W. Swindells became part owner in 1854 and sole owner when Latimer died in 1859. It appears that J. L. Bartow acquired the publishing company in March 1877. In 1879 P. S. Pfouts, J. E. Elliott, and W. L. Hall acquired the company. The paper was renamed the Dallas Weekly Herald in 1873. In 1874 the owners began a second publication, the Dallas Daily Herald, which appeared daily except Monday. The Dallas Morning News began publication on October 1, 1885 and later that year acquired the Weekly Herald and the Daily Herald, both of which ceased publication on December 8, 1885. Although most accounts of the demise of the Herald papers state or imply that the Morning News purchased the papers and closed them, contemporary accounts published in the Morning News could be read to say that the Herald owners decided to invest in the Morning News and to close their papers rather than selling them to new owners. The announcement in the Morning News said in part: In any event, demise of the Herald newspapers removed the most serious competition of the Morning News and allowed it to acquire the Western Associated Press franchise held by the Herald. The Herald under Latimer supported the Democratic Party, slavery, transportation improvements, and education and opposed Sam Houston. It urged Democrats to select the moderate Stephen A. Douglas as the party‚Äôs 1860 presidential nominee, rather than a more extreme Southern partisan because Douglas probably could be elected and would listen to the concerns of the southern states where a less moderate candidate would not likely be elected. When the Ku Klux Klan appeared in Dallas soon after the end of the Civil War, the Herald strongly condemned \\"the ignorant and superstitious members [of the Klan] threatening violence and revolution.\\"  Second Dallas Herald (1886-1888)  The Herald papers had been missing from the Dallas scene for barely more than a month when an item appeared in the Morning News on January 14, 1886 noting that ‚Äúthe first number of the Dallas Daily Herald made its appearance last evening. It is a crisp, bright paper of twenty-eight columns, in a nice new dress . . . .‚Äù Meanwhile, the Morning News continued running daily notices from Herald Publishing Company and A. H. Belo & Co. (publishers of the Morning News), dated November 30, 1885, to the effect that the Herald had turned over its subscription list to the Morning News and that the Morning News would fulfill those subscriptions with its own editions and solicited former Herald subscribers to become Morning News subscribers. These notices did not cease until early April. M. H. Claytor operated this Herald for a few months. Claytor had been manager of the San Antonio Evening Times and in his Herald editorials often advocated for prohibition. On June 7, 1886 it was acquired by Lafayette Lumpkin Foster, a journalist and then speaker of the Texas House of Representatives. Foster was joined that fall by Charles Edwin Gilbert, secretary of the Texas Press AssociationTexas Press Association and editor of the Abilene Reporter in Abilene, Texas.Abilene Reporter-News Gilbert's Herald differed from its major competitor, the Morning News, by sometimes publishing one or more extra editions to report important news and in its appearance: while the Morning News was producing pages of solid gray type broken only by advertising, the Herald used wider columns and broke up its columns with small illustrations. Gilbert also was a prohibitionist and would not accept advertising for beer or other alcohol. The paper lasted through the next year but merged with the Dallas Times to form the Daily Times-Herald, which began publication on January 2, 1888 and which eventually was renamed the Dallas Times Herald and dropped the hyphen.

The card stores a physical or digital pattern that the door mechanism accepts before disengaging the lock. There are several common types of keycards in use, including the mechanical holecard, barcode, magnetic stripe, Wiegand wire embedded cards, smart card (embedded with a read/write electronic microchip), and RFID proximity cards. Keycards are frequently used in hotels as an alternative to mechanical keys. The first commercial use of key cards was to raise and lower the gate at automated parking lots where users paid a monthly fee.\\"Key Card Inserted In Slot Opens Gate At Automated Parking Lot.\\" Popular Science, August 1954, p. 94, mid page. Overview Keycard systems operate by physically moving detainers in the locking mechanism with the insertion of the card, by shining LEDs through a pattern of holes in the card and detecting the result, by swiping or inserting a magnetic stripe card, or in the case of RFID cards, merely being brought into close proximity to a sensor. Keycards may also serve as ID cards. Many electronic access control locks use a Wiegand interface to connect the card swipe mechanism to the rest of the electronic entry system. Newer keycard systems use radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology such as the TLJ infinity. Types of card readers A mechanical keycard, with \\"bumps\\" that operate pins inside of the lock (similar to a pin tumbler lock)  Mechanical  Mechanical keycard locks employ detainers which must be arranged in pre- selected positions by the key before the bolt will move. This was a mechanical type of lock operated by a plastic key card with a pattern of holes. There were 32 positions for possible hole locations, giving approximately 4.3 billion different keys. The key could easily be changed for each new guest by inserting a new key template in the lock that matched the new key. In the early 1980s, the key card lock was electrified with LEDs that detected the holes. A keycard with a magnetic stripe Wiegand cards Since the keycode is permanently set into the card at manufacture by the positions of magnetic wires, Wiegand cards can't be erased by magnetic fields or reprogrammed as magnetic stripe cards can. Many electronic access control locks use a Wiegand interface to connect the card swipe mechanism to the rest of the electronic entry system.  Magnetic stripe  Magnetic stripe (sometimes \\"strip\\") based keycard locks function by running the magnetic stripe over a sensor that reads the contents of the stripe. The stripe's contents are compared to those either stored locally in the lock or those of a central system. Some centralized systems operate using hardwired connections to central controllers while others use various frequencies of radio waves to communicate with the central controllers. Some have the feature of a mechanical (traditional key) bypass in case of loss of power.  Passive RFID  RFID cards contain a small chip and induction loop which the transmitter on the keycard reader can access. The main advantages with RFID cards is that they do not need to be removed from the wallet or pass holder - as the keycard reader can usually read them from a few inches away. Access control In the case of the hotel room lock, there is no central system; the keycard and the lock function in the same tradition as a standard key and lock.

Their property included i.a. the Rococo-classical manor house in Mo≈°ovce, the so-called Old Manor house demolished in the middle of the 20th century, the Noblemen's Mansion and the park in Mo≈°ovce, a castle in Blatnica, lands and a castle in Sklabi≈àa, as well as a manor-house with a park in Turƒçianska ≈†tiavniƒçka. Family history Rococo-classical R√©vay manor house in Mo≈°ovce The R√©vay family has been known since the 13th century. The first known ancestor of the family was called Comes Jakab (Count Jakab) in the early 13th century.http://www.kislexikon.hu/revay.html The main estates of the family were situated in the region of Syrmia until the Ottoman occupation of southern Hungary. In 1556 and 1635 the family was promoted to Barons and on 17 June 1723 to Counts. The coat of arms of the Masters de Reva, which can be seen at the fa√ßade of their manor house, is composed of a wolf Tenn√© growing from a crown of Or, holding three roses. Mo≈°ovce became the property of the R√©vay family in 1534, six years after the donation of the King of Hungary, Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor. The last member of the family, who resided in Mo≈°ovce, was count Ferenc R√©vay. Today the descendants of the family live in Trnava, Bratislava, Austrian Graz as well as in Hungary. The last letter of the name is sometimes \\"i\\" instead of \\"y\\" in some printed versions or as an affair of modernization in the late 19th century Kingdom of Hungary. After World War II, the property of the R√©vay family in Turiec was nationalized. In 1993, the niece of Ladislav R√©vay, the last of the counts, filed a request for the restitution of their property. The request ended up in court as the R√©vay family and the state had differing opinions as to the extent of their claim. In 2001 the restitution claim of the R√©vays was rejected by the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic. 5 years later, however, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg issued a ruling allowing the matter to proceed, thus opening a possibility for a reconciliation of both parties. This resulted in a financial compensation of the state for the husband and of Ladislav R√©vay's niece (who died in 1995) in the amount of SKK 150 million (just under 5 million EUR). In Sweden, the family is considered part of the unintroduced nobility.

Early life Olivia was born in Middletown, Connecticut on March 30, 1784. She was the daughter of Elihu Egleston (d. 1803) and Elizabeth (n√©e Olcott) Egleston (d. 1828). Her maternal grandfather was George Olcott Jr. and her older siblings were Elizabeth Egleston, George Egleston, and Elihu Egleston Jr.. Personal life Phelps Egleston family tree published in Stokes Records 1910 Olivia was married to Anson Greene Phelps (1781‚Äì1853), a businessman who was the co-founder of the Phelps Dodge Company. The other partners in the business were their son, Anson, and sons- in-law, Daniel James, William Dodge and James Stokes. Together, Olivia and Anson were the parents of the following children: * Elizabeth Woodbridge Phelps (1807‚Äì1847), who married Daniel James in New York City on March 24, 1829. * Melissa Phelps (1809‚Äì1903), who married William Earle Dodge on June 24, 1828. * Caroline Olivia Phelps (1811‚Äì1812), who died young. * Caroline Phelps (1812‚Äì1881), who married James Boulter Stokes in New York City on April 12, 1837. * Harriet Phelps (1815‚Äì1892), who married Charles Floyer Pond (1809‚Äì1867), President of the New Haven, Hartford and Springfield Railroad, on May 24, 1836. * Anson Greene Phelps Jr. (1818‚Äì1858), who married Jane Gibson (1818‚Äì1908) in 1845. * Olivia Egleston Phelps (1821‚Äì1894), who married Benjamin Bakewell Atterbury (1815‚Äì1900) on April 21, 1847. * Lydia Ann Phelps (1823‚Äì1831), who died young. After the death of Olivia's husband on November 30, 1853, the partners in the firm bought his holdings from her for $700,000 (equivalent to $ today). Olivia, who was also the sole executrix of his will, continued to live in their home on the East River with her daughter, Olivia, and husband, Benjamin Bakewell Atterbury, plus their children. Olivia's final years were difficult. Initially there were three executors of her husband's will, Olivia, her son Anson and son-in-law William Earl Dodge. Anson and Dodge withdrew because of conflicts of interest in respect to their business connections to Phelps Dodge & Co. The will was contested on many points by the beneficiaries, including their children and grandchildren, and Olivia sought clarification via the courts. The complexity of the arguments resulted in up to 12 lawyers in court at any one time. In 1858 tragedy struck when Olivia's only son, Anson Greene Phelps Jr., died of smallpox and within a year, Olivia herself died in New York on April 24, 1859. It was 1861 before the final verdict on Anson Greene Phelps's will was given by the Court of Appeal. Philanthropy The Anson Greene Phelps house New York on the East river, formally owned by Henry A. Coster, the Dutch merchant. Olivia shared in her husband's religious devotion and charitable works, supporting many causes including the Society for the Relief of Half Orphans and for 25 years she was a member of the board for the Association for the Relief of Aged and Respectable Indigent Woman. In her home, she entertained missionaries and evangelists including Charles Grandison Finney who, with his family, stayed with the Phelps during his preaching at the Presbyterian church in Vandewater Street, New York (1829-1830). Residence This house had originally been built by Henry A. Coster, the Dutch merchant, in about 1810. He planted the grounds with rare fruit, plants, trees, and it was said to have been one of the finest private gardens in America. It was bought by Phelps in 1835 who then acquired adjoining properties, so that the land eventually extended from Third Avenue to the East River, and from Twenty-ninth to half-way between Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth streets. The house was of old Colonial architecture, with out-buildings, hothouses, a large conservatory of rare fruits and flowers, gardener's lodge, stabling, summer house and boat house. From the east portico there were views over the lawn, garden, pasture, and river. A cedar of Lebanon that shaded the ice-house was said to have been brought from Mount Lebanon by Henry Coster.

The highway extends from Route 27 in South Brunswick Township to Main Street (CR 537) in Freehold Borough. Route description Divided portion of CR 522 in South Brunswick CR 522 begins at an intersection with Route 27 on the border of South Brunswick, Middlesex County and Franklin Township, Somerset County. Unsigned, it travels along the divided Promenade Boulevard where it provides access to numerous condominium developments. It crosses U.S. Route 1 (US 1) then passes through forested areas near a few residential subdivisions, turning southeast and passing over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. Following the bridge, the route enters residential areas and intersects CR 681 and CR 697 before coming to an intersection with US 130\\\\. At this point, Promenade Boulevard ends and CR 522 turns south to form a concurrency with US 130 on a four-lane divided highway, passing businesses. CR 522 splits from US 130 at an interchange and heads east on two-lane undivided Ridge Road, running past several distribution warehouses and a couple farms. After passing over the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95), the route continues to an intersection with CR 535. CR 522 eastbound in Freehold Township At this point, the road enters Monroe Township and becomes Rhode Hall Road, passing through agricultural areas before turning south into wooded residential areas. CR 522 crosses into Jamesburg and reaches the CR 698 intersection, at which point the route heads southeast onto Gatzmer Avenue and passes under Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Amboy Secondary before crossing CR 615\\\\. At this point, CR 522 bears left onto Railroad Avenue and runs to the east of Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Freehold Industrial Track through residential and commercial areas in the center of Jamesburg before forming a brief concurrency with CR 612 near Lake Manalapan. Past CR 612, the road continues southeast on Bucklew Avenue through neighborhoods before leaving Jamesburg for Monroe Township again. In this area, the route passes through a mix of woods and residential subdivisions, intersecting CR 614 and CR 613\\\\. At the intersection with the latter, the road becomes Jamesburg-Englishtown Road. A short distance later, CR 522 enters Manalapan Township in Monmouth County and passes through wooded areas with some homes before entering Englishtown. In Englishtown, the route passes homes and turns east onto Water Street, reaching an intersection with CR 527\\\\. CR 522 turns south onto CR 527, and the two routes head south on Main Street past residences and businesses. CR 522 splits from CR 527 by turning east onto Tennent Avenue. The road crosses back into Manalapan Township and becomes Englishtown-Freehold Road, heading southeast past residential neighborhoods and a tract of Monmouth Battlefield State Park. After crossing CR 3 (Tennent Road), the route passes through fields and woods within Monmouth Battlefield State Park. Within the park, CR 522 crosses into Freehold Township and turns east, running immediately to the north of Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Freehold Industrial Track. The road comes to an interchange with US 9, at which point CR 522 is briefly a four-lane divided highway. Past this interchange, the route heads into residential and commercial areas as a two- lane road. Upon entering Freehold Borough, CR 522 becomes municipally maintained Thockmorton Street, which turns southeast into residential areas. At the Monmouth Avenue intersection, the road heads into the commercial downtown of Freehold, where CR 522 ends at CR 537.

The kioea was in decline even before the discovery of Hawaii by Europeans. Even native Hawaiians are seemingly unfamiliar with this bird. The feathers of the kioea were not used in Hawaiian featherwork, nor is it mentioned in any chants or legends. Only four specimens exist in museums. The cause of its extinction is unknown. Description Stuffed specimen Moho apicalis and Chaetoptila angustipluma The kioea was a large bird, about long, with a long, slightly curved bill. What distinguished the kioea from other honeyeaters was the broad black stripe on its face and bristle-like feathers on the head and breast. The Hawaiian word \\"kioea\\" literally means \\"stand tall\\". Although all four known specimens are from the island of Hawaii, fossil records show that related birds existed on other Hawaiian islands as well. The Oahu kioea (Chaetoptila cf.angustipluma) was found on Oahu, Maui and possibly other islands north of Oahu and has an unresolved taxonomic status within the genus Chaetoptila, while the Narrow-biled kioea (?Chaetoptila sp.) was found on Maui and possibly others and is more distinct, possibly not warranting a placement in Chatetoptila at all. Taxonomy Until recently, this species and the birds in the genus Moho were thought to belong to the family Meliphagidae (honeyeaters) because they looked and acted so similar to members of that family, including many morphological details. A 2008 study argued, on the basis of a phylogenetic analysis of DNA from museum specimens, that the genera Moho and Chaetoptila do not belong to the Meliphagidae but instead belong to a group that includes the waxwings and the palmchat; they appear especially close to the silky-flycatchers. The authors proposed a family, Mohoidae, for these two extinct genera.

The site covers an area of , and was extensively surveyed and investigated by the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England in 1991, with finds of Iron Age and Romano-British pottery, Iron Age and Roman coins, and burials of human remains. There is much evidence of prolonged and extensive settlement of the site, including evidence of around 130 structures of various sizes, most probably representing a mix of round houses, pits, and other features. The earthworks of Yarnbury Castle are also a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) first notified in 1951. The site is on private land and has no public access.  Location  Yarnbury Castle is about north of Steeple Langford village, and straddles the boundary between Steeple Langford and Berwick St James civil parishes. The A303 primary route runs close to the southern edge of the site, which by this road is about west of Winterbourne Stoke village. Archaeology Pencil sketch of Yarnbury Castle by Sir Richard Colt-Hoare, 1810, from The Ancient History of Wiltshire The earthworks at Yarnbury consist of three ramparts with outer ditches. The outer ramparts measure up to high, and the ditches a further deep, and are encroached upon by the centre rampart in places, suggesting that the inner and centre rampart are a later feature. The overall width of the earthworks is generally uniform at around . The earthworks are generally well preserved, except in the northeastern side where the outermost ditch has been lost due to the encroachment of a downland driveway. In the centre of the hillfort lies an earlier and smaller single banked enclosure of in area, and with an entrance in the western side of the earthwork. The main earthworks are thought to date from around 100 BC, with the earlier inner circuit being from about 300 BC, according to pottery finds from early Iron Age through to Romano-British, including for Samian of around 160 AD. The main entrance to the hillfort lies on the eastern side of the site, with a complex of earthwork fortifications. There is a further entrance at the northern end, possibly a later addition, with the entrance to the western side thought to be non-original or later so serve a smaller sub-rectangular Romano-British enclosure on that side of the fort. Within the fort there is much evidence for many structures, mainly circular in plan, and within compounds with low earth banks. The structures vary between and in diameter, and up to deep. In particular, in the north and east of the site, and between the earlier enclosure and the inner rampart, there are a number of large compounds containing structures clearly visible, many with evidence for possible stone footings. It is also evident that a number of them overlap and indicate a prolonged and varied occupation of the site. There have been numerous inhumations found at the site including for two within pits, and other isolated human bones found in other pits. Also nine complete or partial remains of newly born and young infants have been found in the bottom of the earthwork ditches. Archaeological finds include for pottery sherds, flint flakes, iron slag, Celtic coins, and bronze brooches. From later periods finds also include for much Roman items, such as pottery, tiles, coins and three burials in graves. Sheep fairs The Winterbourne Stoke sheep fair was held on the site from the 18th century until 1916, when the area was commandeered by the army. There are several prominent features associated with this former use, including for several sheep folds to the south eastern corner of the hillfort. These are grouped in two blocks of 8, with low mounded earthworks clearly visible and covering an area of by . They do not however appear in Sir Richard Colt Hoares pencil sketch of the site from 1810, indicating that these date from later in the 19th century.

Ecology The marsh fritillary can be found at Yarnbury Castle Yarnbury Castle is located in an area of unimproved grassland on the upper chalk north of the Wylye Valley, and on the edge of Salisbury Plain, which is the largest remaining area of calcareous grassland in north-west Europe. The local area supports a rich and diverse grassland flora, which led to it being declared a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1951. Designated as Yarnbury Castle SSSI, the site encompasses a total of . The SSSI designation for the site arises due to interest in the biodiversity and species present upon the earthworks of the fort themselves, with the inner and surrounding parts of the site being of improved agricultural grassland of little interest. The earthworks support a rich chalk grassland flora, including for several rare species. There are 16 species of grass and sedge recorded; with upright brome (Bromus erectus), sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), quaking grass (Briza media), crested hair-grass (Koeleria cristata), and dwarf sedge (Carex humilis). Various herb species include for dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule), chalk milkwort (Polygala calcarea), horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa), common thyme (Thymus praecox), squinancywort (Asperula cynanchica) and common rock- rose (Helianthemum nummularium). Rarer national species include for field fleawort (Senecio integrifolius), bastard toadflax (Thesium humifusum), and burnt orchid (Orchis ustulata), fragrant orchid (Gymnadenia conopsea), and other orchids. The site was previously populated with scattered juniper (Juniperus communis) bushes, but these are now removed and the current grazing regime ensures that they do not return. There are some invertebrates recorded, including for marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) and small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus) butterflies, and a number of downland birds are present including for the skylark, corn bunting and grey partridge.

It was built in 1795 by Britain in order to ensure the security of British North America against any potential threat of American Invasion. Throughout its history, it is most known for its military application during the War of 1812 as Sir Isaac Brock and Tecumseh met here to plan the Siege of Detroit. It was the British stronghold during the War and is now one of the National Historic Sites of Canada.The Fort also had an important role in securing Upper Canada's border with Detroit during the Upper Canada Rebellion.https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/lhn-nhs/on/malden, Fort Malden National Historic Site Fort Malden also has rich and diverse history aside from its military applications. For example, it was the setting for the British Pensioner Scheme and would later become an Ontario Provincial Asylum in 1859. After the Asylum was closed, Fort Malden was surveyed and privatized until the mid-nineteenth century. The Historic Designation of the Fort came after several decades of local residents advocating for the preservation of the Fort to the federal government. Officially recognized in 1921, the complex of Fort Malden as it is seen today was brought together in 1946 with the purchase of the Hough House. Today, the Fort remains open and accessible to the public under the supervision of Parks Canada. Visitors are able to see for themselves a wide array of Fort Malden's history as all of the buildings on the complex represent different time periods within that history. For example, an 1819 Brick Barrack restored in the style of one in 1839 is found directly across from the Hough House that represents the Fort's history as an Asylum, a Lumber Mill, and a private residence History Location of Fort Malden just above Amherstburg Before 1795 After the Indian Land Grant of 1784, it was decided by Governor Haldimand that the land opposite of Bois Blanc Island (now Amherstburg) was to be used as a strategic military defence post.

On July 13, Hull issued this proclamation to the residents of Upper Canada: On July 16, General Hull's army was met with armed British resistance for the first time. A patrol out of Fort Malden engaged with Hull's troops at the River Canard where two British soldiers were killed, marking the first fatalities of the War of 1812. Maj. Gen. Isaac Brock assumed command of Fort Malden on August 13, 1812, and it was Brock who would lead British troops across the Detroit River days later. On August 16, with the help of Chief Tecumseh's Native warriors, Brock and Tecumseh's forces marched on Fort Detroit. It is reported that Hull was fearful of 'hordes' of Indians swooping down upon the civilian population of Detroit, a fear that Brock and Tecumseh were able to capitalize on by convincing Hull that their ranks included 5,000 of Tecumseh's native warriors.Detroit River: A Canadian Heritage River Background Report (1998) It is largely due to the unsettling effect that the Native allies' presence had upon General Hull that Fort Detroit was surrendered without resistance. The success of the Siege of Detroit was an important factor in securing First Nations' support for the British at Fort Malden during the War of 1812. Throughout the War of 1812, the Detroit frontier had been considered \\"a distant and expendable outer branch\\" of the colony that the British were willing to sacrifice in order to protect Montreal and Quebec in Lower Canada, and Niagara and Kingston in Upper Canada.Dennis Carter-Edwards, \\"The War of 1812 along the Detroit Frontier: A Canadian Perspective\\" Michigan Historical Review 13 (Fall 1987): 26‚Äì27. As such, strategic losses at York and Niagara during the spring of 1813 placed the fate of Upper Canada's western territory in jeopardy. Resources had been directed to the Niagara region, and with no chance of receiving significant reinforcements General Proctor was forced to abandon Fort Malden in September 1813. Fort Malden was torched and the Fort's inhabitants fled with American troops on their heels. After engaging the Americans at the Battle of the Thames, General Proctor was eventually successful in his retreat to Niagara. 1813‚Äì1815: American occupation After General Proctor abandoned and burned Fort Malden in the fall of 1813, American forces occupied the towns of Sandwich and Amherstburg, including the land that the Fort had stood on. During this time, the territory was used to conduct supply raids into nearby Chatham-Kent and London, Ontario. The Americans also began reconstruction of Fort Malden near its original location. After the U.S.ratification of the Treaty of Ghent in February, 1815 ended the war, the border between the United States and British North America was restored, returning the property of Amherstburg and Fort Malden to the British. The American army officially withdrew from Fort Malden on July 1, 1815. 1837‚Äì1838: Upper Canada Rebellion After sitting in disrepair for quite some time, Fort Malden was once again used to house military personnel and launch military operations to quell the Upper Canada Rebellion. Most of Fort Malden's involvement dealt with defending Upper Canada from American sympathizers belonging to Hunters' Lodges, who were frequently embarking on border raids along the Detroit River. As a result of America now posing a real threat to the sovereignty of Upper Canada, Fort Malden underwent a period of development where several buildings were constructed and military earthworks repaired. Much of this development was conducted under the supervision of Major H.D. Townshend in 1838, with the 24th and 32nd Regiment occupying the Fort. During this period, there were three regiments, including the Royal Artillery, stationed at Fort Malden to act as a defence against a possible American invasion.Edwards, D. Carter. Research Bulletin Nation Historic Parks and Sites Branch No. 65. (Government Document): Indian and Northern Affairs Parks Canada, 1977. 21. One such attempt by American \\"Hunter\\" Patriots occurred on January 9, 1838 when they attempted to raid the town of Amherstburg by crossing the Detroit River on the Schooner Anne. All three regiments, including bands of town militia and Native American Warriors, successfully defended the town, taking twenty American prisoners including their commander \\"Brigadier-General\\" Edward Alexander Theller. There were also two other battles occurring at Fighting Island and Pelee Island, where a detachment of the Royal Artillery was dispatched to defend against the brigand attacks. However, once the violence of the Upper Canada Rebellion was quelled, the Fort no longer required so many active military regiments. Consequently, the Royal Artillery left between June and July 1839 and the 32nd Regiment also withdrew, disbanding the militia a few months later. 1839‚Äì1858: The Pensioner Scheme Fort Malden circa 1840 As the regiments were leaving the Fort and taking with them much of their military defence arms, the townsfolk of Amherstburg complained that they no longer were properly defended against an American invasion. The result was the stationing of the 34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot at Fort Malden. While there no longer existed any immediate threat of invasion to Upper Canada, the regiment was employed to improve the defence and utility of the Fort in the event that Upper Canada would again be under threat. It was during this time from 1839 to 1840 that Fort Malden underwent its second stage of development under the supervision of Sir Richard Airey, during which more barracks and store houses were constructed. In 1840, there was a decision made to actually replace Fort Malden with an entirely new defence construction in Amherstburg. This would have been described as the third stage of building development from 1840‚Äì1842; however, such plans never came to fruition as the United States and Britain signed the Webster-Ashburton Treaty after several years of negotiations. The result was that Fort Malden was used mainly to house existing or disbanded regiments as a stable garrison, such as the Royal Canadian Rifle Regiment from 1842‚Äì1851 who was composed of veteran English soldiers.Amherstburg 1796‚Äì1996: The New Town in the Garrison Grounds Volume I, Edited by Don Tupling. Amherstburg: Amherstburg Bicentennial Book Committee, 1997. As there was no pressing military threat, life for both soldiers and townsfolk in Amherstburg was considered rather peaceful and marked as a period of growth both for the town and the Fort.Kingsmill, Mrs. Regimental Cookbook: The Thirty-Fourth Regiment Fort Malden ca. 1839. Windsor: The University of Windsor Press, 1972. From 1851‚Äì1859 Fort Malden was occupied by army pensioners in what is known as the Pensioner Scheme. During this period, the town of Amherstburg and Fort Malden were redesigned to accommodate the large numbers of retired military men living in Upper Canada. As Canada had received responsible government following the Rebellions of 1837‚Äì1838, Britain no longer needed to maintain a significant military presence. It has been argued that in order to bring about the easiest transition for traditionally military defence towns such as Amherstburg, Britain enforced the Pensioner Scheme to substitute the standing regular army with pensioners to maintain the authoritative military presence.Dube, Timothy D., \\"The enrolled pensioner scheme in Canada West, 1851‚Äì1858, with specific reference to the plan at Amherstburg.\\" (1982). Electronic Theses and Dissertations. Paper 3979. About 350 individual army pensioners, along with their families, occupied Amherstburg as part of the Pensioner Scheme. They were offered homes and small land grants in accordance with the Ordnance Reserves where in exchange they were employed by the Province to act as police and an interim military force. The Scheme at Fort Malden was considered to be very successful, not only for the pensioners but also the development of the town. Remaining either continually employed or receiving a full military pension, the retired soldiers were important financial assets to Amherstburg's local economy. Additionally, the pensioners, many being Irish Catholic, added to the cultural development of Amherstburg, maintaining a strong presence until about the 1890s. There are several surviving pensioners' cottages remaining on the grounds of Fort Malden and surrounding the King's Navy Yard that are considered focal points in Historic Amherstburg and remain accessible to the public for tours. 1859‚Äì1875: The Asylum Years In 1859, the Pensioner Scheme was abandoned by the British government and ownership of Fort Malden was turned over to the province of Ontario. On June 8, 1859, an Order in Council within the Ontario government determined that Fort Malden would be recommissioned as a provincial insane asylum. Fort Malden was one of many examples where prior ordnance lands were repurposed by order of the province to become asylums, hospitals, or prisons, as these prior forts already possessed many fortified buildings and defences suited for institutional facilities.Report of the Board of Inspectors of Asylums, Prisons, &c.;, for the Year 1863. Quebec City: Hunter, Rose & Co., 1864. Accessed October 19, 2014. It was determined that the Malden Lunatic Asylum would act as an extension of the Toronto Lunatic Asylum to house surplus patients.Botsford, David P., and Linda Beare. At the End of the Trail. Windsor: Windsor Print & Litho Ltd., 1985, 28. However, many of Fort Malden's buildings had been relatively neglected and so much of the first couple years of the Fort's history as an asylum was allotted to necessary reconstruction. This remodeling was performed primarily under the architectural supervision of Kivas Tully who used several of the patients as labourers to help build and remodel the asylum's structures.Heritage Conversation Program, \\"Historic Landscape Conservation Study\\". Real Property Services Public Works & Government Services Canada, (1997). Some of the early remodeling was concerned with repairing the barracks to serve as separate wings for the male and female patients, as well as converting the brick hospital into a kitchen, with the guard house becoming the porter's apartment, used to house the water supply pump, and the officer's quarters becoming the home of the doctor's family. The First Medical Superintendent of the Malden Lunatic Asylum was Dr. Andrew Fisher.Brien, Dr. J. W. \\"The Medical Men of Essex County\\". Windsor: The Windsor Daily Star, 1964. Under his tenure, several more buildings were constructed, such as a replacement laundry building in 1861 that would later be known as the Hough House. Later, in 1864, additions were added to the officer's quarters and staff sergeant's guardhouse. Additionally, in 1860, Dr. Fisher was responsible for the asylum's grounds being enclosed as two thousand yards of fenced-in outdoor space for patient recreation. This could be argued as reflecting Dr. Fisher's more progressive therapeutic methodology of patient treatment. For example, he had the asylum's grounds continually landscaped, established an accessible library for patients, and offered weekly dances and religious services for patient enjoyment. In addition, Dr. Fisher did not place patients in solitary confinement nor prescribe many medications, as is reflected in the 1862 annual asylum report where only $95.13 was recorded to have been spent on narcotics.inAmherstburg 1796-1996: The New Town in the Garrison Grounds Volume II, Edited by Don Tupling. Amherstburg: Amherstburg Bicentennial Book Committee, 1997. However, the asylum's other practices do reflect the hegemonic attitudes towards mental illness during the nineteenth century. While the institution's medicinal expenses remained relatively low, this is likely due to the fact that alcohol was used instead in several treatments, as reflected in the same 1862 report, which cited that $1,125.88 was spent on liquor. Additionally, Dr. Fisher employed his patients as labourers for the asylum, with men doing much of the physical building repairs and women performing housekeeping chores such as laundry. The average length of stay for patients at the Toronto- Malden-London asylum system was eighteen years in the 1860s with a discharge rate of 60% by 1869. During the Fort's time as the Malden Provincial Lunatic Asylum approximately 260 patients, mostly considered \\"quiet chronics\\", were treated.Botsford, David P., and Linda Beare. At the End of the Trail. Windsor: Windsor Print & Litho Ltd., 1985, 108. Most of the patients treated in 1861 are listed as having been born in Ireland out of the 219 patients registered that year.Lesperance, Sharon. \\"1861 Malden Lunatic Asylum, Essex\\" OntarioGenWeb's Census Project. Accessed October 18, 2014. In 1867, Dr. Fisher was forced to resign for alleged financial irregularities in the management of the Fort with Dr. Henry Landor replacing him as the superintendent. Under Dr. Landor's tenure, the asylum underwent several changes. For example, he supervised many building conversions, such as the cook house's transitioning into a laundry site, the porter's lodge becoming a store room, and the old ordnance store's conversion into a barn for threshing oats. Additionally, Dr. Landor revoked the \\"quiet chronics\\" policy and admitted to the asylum more acute violent and suicidal patients. In the early 1870s, Dr. Landor shared the duties of medical superintendent with a Dr. Milligan.Botsford, David P., and Linda Beare. At the End of the Trail. (Windsor: Windsor Print & Litho Ltd., 1985), 110. In total, 30 employees worked at the Malden Lunatic Asylum with several being described as former pensioners. There are a few names of employees that are also found on the 1861 list of admitted patients, such as laundress Mary McGowan. Intriguingly, there are several personal reports of hauntings at Fort Malden by the Historical Interpreters employed there. Currently, it is believed that a woman named Mary, who was employed as a laundry maid, haunts the Hough House, the former laundry location, as she died in a fire within the asylum. While the connection between the real Mary McGowan and this ghost story is undocumented, Ghost stories abound about a time in the Fort's history that is traditionally neglected.J. Brignall (historical interpreter at Fort Malden) in discussion with the author, October 2014. Additionally, for a brief period of time, deceased inmates were buried at the asylum until construction of the Rose Hill Cemetery had been completed.Botsford, David P., and Linda Beare. At the End of the Trail. (Windsor: Windsor Print & Litho Ltd., 1985), 115. In 1870, the Malden Lunatic Asylum was closed and its patients relocated to the London Lunatic Asylum as the Malden branch had always been considered a temporary location within the Provincial Lunatic Asylum system. The Fort remained relatively abandoned until 1875, except for a caretaker on staff to oversee the landscape and building maintenance. However, it should be mentioned that the closing of the asylum was a great detriment to the economy of the town of Amherstburg. For almost sixteen years the asylum acted as a steady market for locally produced goods. Additionally, the asylum was the single largest employer in 1861 for the town. As a result, while Fort Malden would serve several different functions throughout its history, it would always remain of utmost importance to Amherstburg's economy and development engendered by and originating from its military days. 1876‚Äì1935: Survey Division In 1875, after remaining abandoned for almost five years, Fort Malden was surveyed by the town of Amherstburg and sold at public auction. Known as the Ordnance Lands, eleven lots were created out of the former fort and sold to several prominent families within the town. As a result, Laird Avenue, North Street, and Dalhousie Street were designed to allow access to the now subdivided lots. Lots A and B were reserved by the Ontario government and leased back to the town of Amherstburg to be used as a park space and to host agricultural fairs. The main fort complex, known as Lot 4, was purchased by a local dentist, Andrew Borrowman, to be used as a speculative property. Lots 1, 2, and 3, which contained therein the original location of the medical superintendent's house on the asylum grounds, were purchased by John McLeod. The Falls family purchased the largest section of the lots that bordered the Detroit River, with other smaller owners being H.G. Duff and F.P. Scratch. The other smaller lots were intended for residential use.\\"Fort Malden: A Structural Narrative History 1796-1976\\" by Dennis Carter-Edwards. 1980, Volume II. Parks Canada Manuscript Report Number 401. Soon after Andrew Borrowman purchased Lot 4, he began to lease the land to John R. Park & William Borrowman to serve as the location of their Park & Borrowman Lumber Mill. Many of the buildings that had remained from the asylum years where either destroyed or converted to suit the industrial needs of the Lumber Mill. For example, the previous laundry building had been converted into the company's titular mill. Not much is known about Park & Borrowman Lumber Mill except for the fact that the company remained inactive during the First World War, resulting in one of the owner's daughters selling the property in 1918 to Franklin A. Hough. Meanwhile, John McLeod died in 1891, leaving Lots 1, 2, and 3 to his widow who, from 1891 until 1907, had begun to slowly sell off the property. The main buyers were the Falls brothers, who purchased a bulk of the Lots in 1900 and thus further subdivided the land. In 1908, W. S. Falls purchased the prior medical superintendent's residence of the Malden Lunatic Asylum and in 1917 began to construct residences on the property. The Falls brothers sold Lot 3 where the former superintendent's residence had been in 1926 to a retired Detroit lawyer, Malcolm McGregor. Later known as the McGregor House, he had Lot 3 undergo many changes, such as landscaping the old southeast bastion and ditch to become a botanical garden and destroying the southeast portion of the fort to allow for even more residential homes to be built along the waterfront. However, the most lasting change to the landscape of the Fort Malden was enacted by Franklin A. Hough, who had purchased Lot 4. A former one-term mayor of Amherstburg from 1907 to 1909, Hough had trained to become a lawyer and practiced as a junior partner at Reade & Kirkland in Amherstburg. His intention was to purchase Lot 4, as well as the former laundry/mill, and alter the land and its building so as to beget a more manorial presence. As a result, he demolished or moved several of the former military buildings that had remained and been converted, such as a brick barracks and the ordnance building, off of the property. The most significant change was Hough's decision to remodel the lumber mill into his private residence. Under the architectural supervision of Harold McEvors, he had the mill converted to mimic a Colonial Revival style, completely altering the industrial and architectural character of the building. His design for Lot 4, particularly his intention of creating a manor house, have endured up until the present day and will be maintained according to the \\"Heritage Character Statement\\" created by the Federal Heritage Buildings Review Office once Parks Canada determined Fort Malden to be a National Historic Site.\\"Hough House 91-181: Heritage Character Statement\\" Federal Heritage Buildings Review Office. Accessed October 18, 2014. Consequently, the privatization of the Fort was the focus of the turn of the twentieth century and was facilitated by the development of several manorial estates. 1935‚Äìpresent: The National Historic Site While the previous decades concerned the private ownership of the Fort, the mid- twentieth century was focused upon reclaiming the land for public use. The first incident was in 1917 when an issue over unpaid back taxes resulted in the town of Amherstburg seizing a small area of privately owned land known as the Webber property and then turning over ownership of it to the Federal government.Heritage Conservation Program, \\"Historic Landscape Conservation Study\\". Real Property Services Public Works & Government Services Canada, (1997), 61. In the 1930s, the Cleveland Cliffs Iron and Coal Company were persuaded not to renew their mortgage on the north section of the northeast bastion, which resulted in the town purchasing the land and then turning it over to the Department of Mines and Resources National Parks Division.Marsh, John A. With the Tide: Recollections and Anecdotal Histories of the Town of Amherstburg and the Lower Detroit River District. Amherstburg: Marsh Collection Society Tri-Graphics Brown & Associates, 1995, 49. After the death of Franklin A. Hough in 1946, the Federal government purchased Lot 4. Additionally, in 1958, the Federal government repeated the same action with the McGregor House, purchasing it from his estate. This acquisition and aggregation of property was due to the fact that there was a growing number of townspeople who were determined to have Fort Malden designated a Heritage Site in order to protect the area. Starting as early as 1904, residents had sent a petition to the Minister of Militia and Defence asking the Fort to be reserved as a park. This was done again in 1912, this time with a second petition sent to Sam Hughes, the Minister of Defence. In 1913, a small delegation from Amherstburg met with Prime Minister Borden who had seemed in agreement with them at the time; however, the advent of World War I halted the process. The Historic Sites and Monuments Board recognized the Fort in 1921 and suggested that a plaque be erected to commemorate the area. This particular plaque was finally placed, over ten years later, on the tax defaulted Webber property.Amherstburg 1796-1996: The New Town in the Garrison Grounds Volume II, Edited by Don Tupling. Amherstburg: Amherstburg Bicentennial Book Committee, 1997, 285. In 1938, the Fort Malden Management Committee was formed under the direction of MP S. Murray Clark to advocate for the improvement of the Fort and to build a museum. They received approval for the construction of a museum on the Webber property, which was completed in the summer of 1939. The first curator of the museum was Management Committee member David Botsford who was responsible for much of the early archive collection at the Fort. Finally, on December 28, 1940, an Order in Council from the Federal Government designated Fort Malden as a National Historic Park with its official opening taking place on June 22, 1941. However, it was not until the purchase of Lot 4 that the Fort come to acquire many of its recognizable features, such as the Hough House, the earthworks, the bastion, the barrack, and the former laundry building. Currently, the National Historic Site is 4.5 hectares and includes the Fort itself, the Brick Commissariat building constructed in 1831, the King's Navy Yard Park, and a stone lighthouse built in 1836. Fort Malden's preservation and the popularity of the site has led to an increased interest in cultivating the Town of Amherstburg's heritage. In addition to the Fort's museum and archive, Fort Malden also offers educational experiences to the public. These tours, group sessions, and camps are primarily geared towards elementary school groups and focus on the Fort's military past, as well as the daily settler life in the town. Underground Railroad The town of Amherstburg was historically referred to as Fort Malden, or simply Malden, due to the Fort's prevalence within the settlement's origins and history.Tom Calarco, Places of the Underground Railroad: A Geographical Guide (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, LLC, 2011), 15. Thus, many historical accounts make reference to the Fort's title but are also implicitly referring to the structure's surrounding area. This is of particular importance when discussing Fort Malden's role in relation to refugee slaves and the Underground Railroad in that discussions of the Fort's functions were not limited to the confines of its military structures but also extended beyond their walls in that the Fort itself facilitated and protected such migration and settlement. Hence, beyond Fort Malden's status as an important military structure, the stronghold also possesses a rich cultural history through its status as an important station and focal point of activity along the Underground Railroad. Fort Malden was deemed the \\"chief place of entry\\" for those refugees seeking to enter Canada so as to escape slavery within the United States.Fred Landon, \\"Amherstburg, Terminus of the Underground Railroad,\\" The Journal of Negro History 10, no.1 (1925): 1. The abolitionist Levi Coffin supported this assessment, describing Fort Malden as, \\"the great landing place, the principle terminus of the underground railroad of the west.\\"Fred Landon, \\"Amherstburg, Terminus of the Underground Railroad,\\" The Journal of Negro History 10, no.1 (1925): 5. After 1850, approximately thirty fugitive slaves a day were crossing over to Fort Malden by steamboat. Sultana was one of such ships and made \\"frequent round trips\\" between Great Lakes ports. Its captain, C.W. Appleby, a celebrated mariner, facilitated the conveyance of several fugitive slaves from various Lake Erie ports to Fort Malden.Tom Calarco, Places of the Underground Railroad: A Geographical Guide (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, LLC, 2011), 110. Though many fugitive slaves did not remain in the Amherstburg region, seeking to move far from the border and its threat of recapture, the influx of people made a dramatic and lasting impact upon the character and size of the settlement's population. At the start of the American Civil War, \\"800 blacks called Fort Malden home\\" and these refugees constituted forty percent of the area's population.Tom Calarco, Places of the Underground Railroad: A Geographical Guide (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, LLC, 2011), 16. A previous assessment in 1855 estimated the African-Canadian population to be somewhere between 400 and 500 persons, demonstrating that a rapid doubling of the populace occurred within a relatively short period of time due to the massive immigration occurring by way of the fort. The motivation behind such accelerated migration, beyond the obvious horrors of slavery, was the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which rendered even those slaves who had escaped to the northern states vulnerable to capture and punishment, as well as those who assisted them.Fred Landon, \\"Amherstburg, Terminus of the Underground Railroad,\\" The Journal of Negro History 10, no.1 (1925): 2. There exists unique terminology that developed in association with the Underground Railroad that contributed towards its secretive and covert nature. Detroit, the location from which most runaway slaves funneled into Canada, was known by the codename \\"Midnight\\". The Detroit River was colloquially referred to as \\"Jordan\\", a biblical allusion to the river of the same name across which the Israelites traveled to reach the Promised Land. Canada, as a terminus along the Railroad's metaphorical tracks, was often referred to as \\"Dawn\\", symbolizing the hope and possibility that it represented for so many African- American emigrants.\\"Underground Railroad\\", Black History Canada, accessed November 5, 2014. Fort Malden, due to its positioning along the Detroit River, became a close and thereby popular hub of immigration for those traversing the border and seeking freedom. Those who succeeded in reaching Canada were understandably eager to remain within the country's protective borders. Ergo, many of the Railroad's refugees became enthusiastic volunteers for local militias during periods of conflict. During both the War of 1812 and the 1837 Rebellions, Black Canadians served with distinction at Fort Malden.\\"Existing Historic Sites Related to the Underground Railroad\\", Parks Canada, accessed November 5, 2014. In 1807, deserters from the black militia of Detroit came to work at Fort Malden and were neither segregated nor denied promotions.Robin W. Winks, The Blacks in Canada: A History (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1997), 150. Furthermore, the Second Essex Company of Coloured Volunteers \\"manned Fort Malden from Christmas Day, 1837, until May\\" and were participants in the capturing of the schooner Anne in 1838.Robin W. Winks, The Blacks in Canada: A History (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1997), 151. Fort Malden was thus an embodiment of freedom for those travelling along the Underground Railroad, acting as a gateway, refuge, and even a place of eventual settlement for those journeying into Canada. Today, the town of Amherstburg proudly hosts The North American Black Historical Museum and Cultural Centre Inc, the first black historical site in Canada.\\"About\\" North American Black Historical Museum, accessed November 6, 2014 Designated a National Historic Site of Canada, this museum serves as a testament to the rich history of Fort Malden and its role in many African-Americans' journeys to reach freedom. Tecumseh and the British‚ÄìIndian alliance In the late 18th century, as a result of American expansion westward into First Nations' territory in the Great Lakes region, many displaced Native peoples traveled from Fort Detroit to Fort Malden. The British offered asylum to those who feared retribution by the Americans after the Battle of Tippecanoe and the Battle of Fallen Timbers, though that was generally where their assistance would end. However, a notable exception to this ambivalent relationship was the military alliance during the War of 1812 between the British at Fort Malden and Tecumseh, chief of the Shawnee People. Canadian novelist John Richardson, who witnessed Tecumseh first-hand at Fort Malden, described the chief as having an \\"ardor of expression in his eye that could not fail to endear him to the soldier hearts that stood around him.\\"Detroit River: A Canadian Heritage River Background Project (1998), 21 Tecumseh was an advocate for a military alliance between Great Britain and the First Nations of the Great Lakes region as a means of defending against American aggression and expansion into what was at the time the western frontier.Detroit River: A Canadian Heritage River Background Project (1998) Tecumseh played a significant role in the Siege of Detroit, an event that helped to solidify the alliance between the British and First Nations of the Great Lakes region during the War of 1812. General William Hull, who was in command of Fort Detroit when it was surrendered to the British forces, was mortified at the prospect of Tecumseh's Native warriors invading the fort and attacking its civilian population. Tecumseh was able to capitalize on this fear, and by repeatedly parading his men loudly through a distant clearing outside of Fort Detroit was able to convince General Hull that their numbers were much greater than was the reality. Despite this joint military success, the interests of the British were not entirely aligned with those of their First Nations allies. When Britain's position on the Detroit frontier wavered and General Henry Proctor abandoned Fort Malden, Tecumseh's reaction was that First Nations had been betrayed.Dennis Carter-Edwards, \\"The War of 1812 along the Detroit Frontier: A Canadian Perspective,\\" Michigan Historical Review 13 (Fall 1987) On September 18, 1813 General Proctor made it known to the Indian Council that Fort Malden would be abandoned. In Tecumseh's address to Proctor he laments that British dedication would waver in the face of defeat while the First Nations remained committed to the defence of their territory. He outlines the brief history of the First Nations' involvement in the war against the Americans, and scolds the British for what he perceives as cowardice, stating: > You always told us to remain here and take care of our lands. It made our > hearts glad to hear that was your wish... but now, father, we see you > drawing back, and we are sorry to see our father doing so without seeing the > enemy. We must compare our father's conduct to a fat animal, that carries > its tail upon its back, but when affrighted, it drops it between its legs > and runs off.\\"Speech of Tecumseh\\" Parks Canada. Accessed November 26, 2014. Despite their protests, Tecumseh and his men would follow General Proctor in their retreat from Fort Malden towards Niagara. It was on this route that Tecumseh was killed at the Battle of the Thames on October 5, 1813. Major structures and layout Over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Fort Malden underwent multiple facelifts, which saw the construction and demolition of many building sites associated with the fort. The present day fort is made up of a handful of buildings that have been restored for preservation and tourism purposes. Each structure is recognized as a Federal Heritage Building based on historical significance, as well as architectural and environmental importance. Hough House The Hough House was originally constructed in late nineteenth century, but has since been restored as a Colonial Revival-style building. The structure showcases exquisite masonry work and wood detailing. The wood shingle roof, stone accents, facades, and Palladian-style windows makes the Hough House the most stylish structure within the fort. The two-and-a-half storey building sits amongst the earthworks, creating an environment that resembles that of a countryside manor. The Hough House is perhaps the most visited site of Fort Malden, largely due to its attractive design, and more importantly the fact that it plays host to a large number of records and archives pertaining to the history of the fort itself.Parks Canada \\"Hough House Classified Federal Heritage Building\\" Pc.gc.ca. Last modified March 15, 2012. Brick Barracks The single-storey Brick Barracks were built in 1820 Due to its location amongst the earthworks of the fort, the barracks has become a centrepiece of Fort Malden. The building was designed based on the simple, standardized military bungalow layout of the 1800s. This prominent building stands out amongst the rest of the fort structures due to its long, rectangular shape, as well as its distinctive red brick exterior. Large bay windows along the entranceway complement the front porch and wooden doors. As this building was part of the restoration process that took place over the late twentieth century, its interior layout has been altered with refinished hardwood floors and additions to all three sections of the core of the building. The restoration also included the reconstruction of chimneys, doors, and windows.Parks Canada, \\"Brick Barrack Classified Federal Heritage Building\\" Pc.gc.ca. Last modified March 15, 2012. Visitor Centre The single storey building acts the main entrance to the fort, and offers information to visitors and tourists. Originally, the Visitor Centre operated as the museum before exhibits and archives were relocated to the Hough House. Rectangular in shape, the structure was designed to follow the theme of the Colonial Revival style of the other buildings located within the fort, and exhibits a limestone exterior, incorporated with stone chimneys, multi-pane windows, and primmed rear and frontal gardens.Parks Canada, \\"Visitor Orientation Centre Classified Federal Heritage Building\\".

The building itself is located within the Amherstburg Navy Yard. It was used primarily as a means to administer service contracts to military members during the mid-nineteenth century. The Callum House resembles the design of the Barracks found within Fort Malden; however, unlike the barracks, the Commissariat Office was designed without a verandah. The building underwent a restoration process carried out by Parks Canada in the 1980s, which refurbished much of the original exterior work done by the building's designer, Captain Philpotts of the Royal Engineers. As for the interior, the Parks Canada's restoration team decided to preserve the original layout and design.Parks Canada, \\"Commissariat Office/Callum House Recognized Federal Heritage Building\\" Pc.gc.ca.

The site located on the outskirts of Fort Malden and overlooks the Detroit River. The original dockyard has been defunct, with the majority of the land becoming privately owned for personal estates. The site was built in 1796, and acted as a supply depot and ship building centre for the British military. Many of the ships used throughout the War of 1812 built and serviced in the navy yard up until its demolition in 1813. The land has since been restored as a community park, and features gardens, gazebos, and recreational areas.

She made her first on-screen appearance on 5 June 1997 and departed on 7 April 2000. Casting The character of Justine was Desborough's first on-going television role. Justine was initially a guest character and Desborough began filming her first scenes in March 1997. She returned as a permanent cast member the following month. In January 2000, it was announced Desborough had decided to leave Home and Away. Development Justine and her brother Aaron (Richie Gudgeon) spent time on the city streets and Justine developed an addiction to drugs. Aaron felt he could not help Justine with her drug habit and ran away to Summer Bay. In 1997, Justine arrives in the Bay to visit Aaron and she tells him she is drug- free and wants to make a fresh start. It soon becomes obvious the story is not true and as Aaron tries to help his sister, she runs away. Justine later returns and is placed in foster care with Pippa Ross (Debra Lawrance). The official Home and Away website said \\"This time Justine really is off drugs but she is still angry with Aaron‚Äîand the world in general. Despite her angry facade, this year Justine will show her more vulnerable side.\\" In 1999, Justine was accused of murdering Ruby Collins (Brittany Jones; Sian Tierney), a young child. The Home and Away writers scripted the storyline after being inspired by the real trials of Louise Woodward and Louise Sullivan. Desborough told Jason Herbision of Inside Soap that she was really excited to read the script and said it was a strong storyline to be working on. Justine decides to take up babysitting as a way of making extra money. She babysits Ruby Collins and notices there are bruises on her rib cage. She confronts Ruby's parents, but they throw her out of the house. Justine is shocked when the police turn up to question her about the child. Desborough explained \\"The cops arrive and tell Justine the baby is in a coma. They claim that she was in that state when Justine left, which simply isn't true - Justine heard her crying.\\" Justine is taken to the station and changed with assault. Desborough told Annette Dasey of Inside Soap that the situation is \\"terribly frustrating\\" for Justine as she knows she did not do it. Ruby later dies and despite all the gossip going around Summer Bay, Justine tries to hold her head up and decides to go to Ruby's funeral. Desborough said Justine was set to run away, but Rebecca Nash's (Belinda Emmett) attitude changes her plans. The actress said \\"Rebecca's beginning to think that Justine could be guilty, and Justine reckons the only way to prove her wrong is to stand up and face the music.\\" Justine stands trial for Ruby's murder and the prosecution focuses on her failure to report the bruising she found on the baby. The jury find Justine guilty of manslaughter and she is sent to prison. Ruby's mother eventually comes forward and reveals her husband was actually responsible for their daughter's death. Justine is released and Desborough said she is too exhausted to feel relieved when she gets out and she is not in a party mood. A writer for Inside Soap said it becomes apparent Justine's nightmare is far from over. A reporter turns up looking for her side of the story and her mother, Sharon (Shayne Francis), who tried to sell her story, also arrives. Desborough told the magazine, \\"Justine never wants to speak to her mother again, but she's not really sure how she feels about the newspaper offer.\\" The actress said Justine wants to get her point of view across, but after what happened with her mother, she does not trust the press. Desborough revealed she had enjoyed filming the scenes, but was looking forward to a less traumatic storyline in the future. She explained \\"It was great working on the storyline, because I got to do so many things which challenged my acting abilities. But I think I've had more than my fair share of drama for a while.\\" Storylines Justine arrives in the bay and cons Marilyn Fisher (Emily Symons) and her stepdaughter, Rebecca out of money by telling them her baby is unwell and she needs a taxi to get to hospital. Aaron, Justine's brother asks her what she is doing in the Bay. It soon becomes apparent Justine is a heroin junkie and she begins stealing from Aaron's guardians Alf (Ray Meagher) and Ailsa Stewart (Judy Nunn). Justine tries to show she is a reformed character by organising a charity event at the surf club with boxer Kostya Tszyu as a guest. However, after the fundraiser, Justine secretly buys some drugs from a dealer. Aaron confronts Justine and accuses her of using, which she denies. Alf and Ailsa's son, Duncan (Lewis Devaney) discovers syringes under Justine's bed and brings one into the dining room, prompting Alf to lose his temper and order Justine to leave. Aaron decides to leave with her and tries to help her by taking away a bag of drugs but when he drops the bag in the diner, he is arrested. Justine then leaves Summer Bay after Aaron refuses to help her. Justine returns several weeks later and is fostered by Pippa Ross. Justine has a new boyfriend Danny Mackson, a dealer. Everyone tells her he is bad news but Justine refuses to take it on board until Danny attacks Sam Marshall (Ryan Clark). Justine then causes problems at home by encouraging foster sister, Tiegan Brook (Sally Marrett) to shoplift, landing her in trouble. Alf later catches Justine stealing from his bait shop and makes it common knowledge. Justine feeling like a pariah, decides to run away and steals a boat from the harbour and rows away. Everyone fears for her safety as Cyclone Raymond is approaching Summer Bay. Ian Routledge (Patrick Dickson) saves Justine and she is grateful. Vinnie Patterson (Ryan Kwanten) takes an interest in Justine but Pippa does not approve of him. After Pippa leaves to be with Ian, Rebecca and her husband, Travis Nash (Nic Testoni) move into Summer Bay house and assume responsibility for Justine, Tiegan and Sam. When Justine asks Rebecca if Vinnie can stay over, she agrees but this decision causes controversy in the community but Rebecca does not back then. When the time comes, Vinnie declines and admits to Justine he is still a virgin. Justine later breaks up with Vinnie when she falls for Tom (Graeme Squires) during rehearsals for a Year 11 production of Romeo and Juliet. Justine takes a job babysitting for Steve (Don Halbert) and Wendy Collins (Jayne Leslie), looking after their baby daughter, Ruby. Ruby suffers a fall and later dies. Justine is accused then, arrested and charged. Justine's mother Sharon reappears in her life claiming to support her but records Justine on tape saying she killed the baby. The case brought to trial and with Sharon's testimony, Justine found guilty of manslaughter and imprisoned. A week later, Steve comes forward and admits to causing Ruby's injuries and Justine is released. After completing her HSC, Justine lands a role in a play. The director, Curt Bacon (Michael Rowan) spends plenty of time rehearsing with Justine and anticipates a forthcoming scene where she is required to be naked. Justine soon sees through Curt's seedy intentions and improvises a scene on stage, exposing Curt's true nature. Justine then receives an offer of an acting job and she leaves the Bay several weeks later. Reception For her portrayal of Justine, Desborough was nominated for \\"Most Popular New Talent\\" at the 1998 Logie Awards.

Rubbo studied at Scotch College, Melbourne, and read anthropology at Sydney University, before travelling on a Fulbright scholarship to study film at Stanford University, California where he got his MA in Communication Arts. Rubbo worked for 20 years as a documentary film director at the National Film Board of Canada before returning to Australia. Early career Rubbo worked for 20 years as a documentary film director at National Film Board of Canada, taking time off in between films to teach both in Australia at the just opened National Film School, and U.S. universities (including Harvard University). Hired by the NFB to make films for children, Rubbo directed over 40 documentaries, winning many international prizes. His best known documentaries are Sad Song of Yellow Skin (1972)) (filmed in Vietnam during the war), Waiting for Fidel (1973), Wet Earth and Warm people (a personal journey through Indonesia), Margaret Atwood: Once in August (1984), and a more recent documentary made after his NFB tenure, Much Ado About Something (2001). Much Ado About Something explores the possibility that Christopher Marlowe was the hidden hand behind William Shakespeare. \\"Rubbo marshals the evidence with lucidity and zest and comes to his own original and contentious conclusion\\" - Suzy Baldwin, Sydney Morning Herald. Working at the NFB, Rubbo was an early pioneer in the field of metafilm, creating subjective, highly personal films that were more like personal journals than objective records of reality. Sad Song of Yellow Skin, Rubbo's reaction to the Vietnam war, is his most awarded film in this genre. That Rubbo should have pursued this vision at the National Film Board was particularly striking, as the NFB's English-language production branch had, during Rubbo's tenure, generally encouraged a much more objective approach to non-fiction film, including the use of voice-of-God narration. His films have been widely shown on TV; Much Ado About Something being repeated several times on PBS Frontline Program which still sells the film. His work is also in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) New York and film schools around the world. He has been visiting lecturer at New York University, UCLA, Stanford University and the University of Florida with longer teaching periods at Harvard University and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School (AFTRS). In 1973, he helped found Film Australia, an independent organization devoted to the promotion of Australian cinema. Rubbo has also directed and written four children's feature films including The Peanut Butter Solution (1985), Tommy Tricker and the Stamp Traveller (1988) along with its sequel The Return of Tommy Tricker (1994), and the Daytime Emmy award-winning film Vincent and Me (1990). He spent some time as the Head of Documentaries at Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Television, encouraging cinema v√©rit√© and instigating the popular Race Around the World series. Julian Assange Mike was involved in helping to get the release of James Richardson from a Cambodian prison in 2018. After that, collaborating with James and many others, he has been working to free Julian Assange who is facing extradition to the US. Recent work In 2004, he made a documentary All about Olive about Australian centenarian Olive Riley, which was shown on the ABC. Born in 1899, Olive Riley went back to her birthplace, Broken Hill to tell the story of her life. She helped them with the directing. After making All about Olive, Mike helped her become the world's oldest blogger and YouTube video poster, a title she held from 2006 to 2008, gaining fans around the world. Whilst Olive, who was given a co-directing credit failed to make it to the Guinness World Records as the world's oldest director, Jeanne Calment, the oldest human to have ever lived and another of Mike's stars, did make into the records book as the world's oldest actor. That was for her role, appearing as herself at the age of 114, in Rubbo's 'Vincent and Me'. Publications He has recently published a book, Travels with My art, which draws together the two major threads in his life, art and filmmaking, showing how they enrich each other. It's very much an advocacy book about the good things that art, either the making or the viewing of, can do in our lives. Information about the book and his film work is available on his website, michaelrubbo.com.au  Village filmmaker  \\"Mike is a community filmmaker; he calls himself the village film maker. His advocacy films, such as recent ones on dog owners rights, and the Avoca Theatre come across as moderate and reasonable in tone which makes their advocacy all the more effective.\\" Katerina Korolkevich-Rubbo There are over 200 viewable clips by Rubbo online, with total views approaching 1 million. Most of his films are centered on Avoca Beach, NSW where he lives with his family, an hour and a half drive north of Sydney.  Bike activism  Approximately 30 films of his on YouTube are about cycling with an emphasis on bikes as transport, using only European-style stately sit-up bikes. He also promotes electric bikes, which he believes are a good way back to cycling for many Australians.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNjFvL4uzO4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjDNfU_XdNs&index;=5&list;=PL9811231832E321ED In these films, he's also campaigned for helmet choice, believing that getting rid of Australia's compulsory helmet law will free up every day cycling. He points out that public bike share schemes, now a feature of so many cities, can't work well in Australia because of the compulsory helmet law.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vmYuKcvau8. He also expresses an extreme disdain for sport cycling in some of his YouTube videos such as road cycling, mountain biking, and track cyclinghttps://datillo.wordpress.com/2009/09/25/treating-beetle- banehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb9jiIlN8fQ, and believes that owning and riding road bicycles, time trial bicycles, track bicycles, gravel bicycles, cyclo-cross bicycles, mountain bikes, and even hybrid bicycles‚Äîas well as wearing specific cycling clothing‚Äîshould be discouragedhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNjFvL4uzO4&t;=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHzcSv6pc- ohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KYrn_NzfL4&t;=115https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A59HlmRqaew He has set up a bicycle art site, www.situp-bike-art.com, believing that art can help promote riding bikes as transport, and that people should only ride Dutch type upright city bikes and upright cargo bikes. \\"When people start putting bike art on their walls\\", he says, \\"then the image of cycling will change.\\"  Avoca Beach Picture Theatre  For more than ten years, along with many locals, Rubbo has been involved in a campaign to preserve the low key charm of the famous single screen cinema in Avoca Beach. That cinema was recently chosen by the BBC, as one of the 10 most beautiful in the world. Mike, and many who live at Avoca believe that the cinema is an important community hub, and that the plans presently on the table, to turn it into a five screen multiplex, are the wrong way to go. To prove that single screens and twins are not dinosaurs, Mike has created, with the help of Charles Nicholls, a website called cinematourista.http://www.cinematourista.com The aim is to show that a surprising number of little cinemas are surviving and thriving, and also, to encourage people to think of such charming picture palaces as interesting tourist destinations. New South Wales has more small cinemas than any other state in Australia. They are priceless tourist assets. Personal life Anna Rubbo Rubbo is the son of Australian microbiologist, Sydney Rubbo, and the grandson of the painter and teacher, Antonio Dattilo Rubbo. He has always been a painter as well as film-maker. Rubbo lives in Avoca Beach with his wife Katerina, a Russian interpreter, ESOL Teacher, icon painter/artist. She collaborates with Mike on film and art projects. His daughter Ellen Rubbo is a songwriter, producer and collaborator under the artist name Ellika Dattilo. Ellen also has a background in Business Marketing, Events Management, Communications and PR. Mike also has a son, Nicolas, living in Canada working for La Ruche, a crowfunding not for profit, as VP, Development and Marketing and previously was Senior Director of Marketing for top-ranked Canadian law firm McCarthy T√©trault. Rubbo has three sibling: Kiffy Rubbo (1944‚Äì1980) artist and gallery director, Anna Rubbo a global architectural activist and Mark Rubbo (b1948) who is managing director of Readings bookshops in Melbourne. He is a past president of the Australian Booksellers Association and was founding chair of the Melbourne Writers Festival. In 2006 he was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia.

Early life Lake was born in Charleston, South Carolina. In the early 1900s, her father and uncle toured with a circus in an aerial act known as \\"The Flying Silverlakes\\". Her mother, Edith Goodwin, was an actress. Her parents later appeared in vaudeville in a skit \\"Family Affair\\", traveling throughout the South and Southwest United States. Florence and her younger brother Arthur Silverlake, Jr. became part of the act in 1910. Their mother brought the children to Hollywood to get into the burgeoning film industry. Arthur changed his professional name to Arthur Lake and later achieved great success as \\"Dagwood Bumstead\\" in the Blondie movie series. Early career Before acting in films, Lake was the leading lady for the Raynor Lehr stock theater company. Her film debut came in New Year's Eve (1929). Comic acting persona Lake was petite, with a high-pitched speaking voice. She perfected a comical singsong delivery that established her in \\"dumb\\" roles. She personified flightiness in the Kennedy shorts, as the scatterbrained Mrs. Kennedy. After the series ended upon Kennedy's death in 1948, she continued to play character roles in films and television. Her best- known TV role was Jenny, the Calverton telephone operator in Lassie. Lake played the role for the entire ten year \\"farm seasons\\" of the show (1954‚Äì1964), thus becoming the Lassie player with the longest run on the series. She played the role of Mama Angel in \\"The Angel and the Outlaw\\", a 1957 episode of the TV series The Lone Ranger. She also appeared in the first color episode of the TV series Superman in 1957 as a cave woman.IMDB Page On old-time radio, Lake portrayed Jessie in Charlie and Jessie, Tess Terwilliger in David Harum, Mrs. Featherstone's daughter in The Gay Mrs. Featherstone, and Miss Smith in Phone Again Finnegan. In her later years, Lake appeared as Elvira Norton on an episode of Dragnet entitled \\"Frauds\\". She appeared in an episode of the 1973 situation comedy A Touch of Grace, and later that year played a blind date for the character Lou Grant on The Mary Tyler Moore Show episode, \\"Lou's First Date\\". Her last roles were in the TV series Emergency!, Baretta in 1976, and Most Wanted in 1977.

It was fully wheelchair-accessible, with a chairlift. It closed in April 2009, following withdrawal of funding from Glasgow City Council. This is turn was caused by reported concerns (unfounded, the Centre Board and AGM claim, and yet to be substantiated) of mismanagement. On 17 March 1991, the first ceilidh was held to raise funds for and awareness of the planned Centre, and this has since become an annual event. Other funding was received from sources such as Strathclyde Regional Social Strategy, Strathclyde Lesbigay Forum, and the Glasgow Development Agency. The chairlift was funded by a grant from Glasgow District Council. The Centre (then called Glasgow Gay and Lesbian Centre) was opened at premises in Dixon Street (just off St Enoch Square) on November 4, 1995.

Later substitutes for the poodle patch included flamingoes, flowers, and hot rod cars.Charles Panati: Panati‚Äôs Parade of Fads, Follies, and Manias. 1991 Hemlines were to the knee or just below it. It quickly became very popular with teenage girls, who wore them at school dances, and as everyday wear. Creation The skirt originated in 1947 in the United States, designed by Juli Lynne Charlot. The idea for the skirt began as Charlot needed a last- minute Christmas skirt. With little money and little ability to sew, she made the seamless skirt herself out of felt. As Charlot's skirt caught on, she was asked to make a dog-themed skirt, as dogs were popular. She initially designed the skirt with three dachshunds, which would all have three personalities. The first dog would be a flirty girl, the second dog would be a snobby girl, and the third dog would be a male attracted to the flirty girl dog. However, due to the leashes being tangled, the male dog would be stuck next to the snobby girl dog. Charlot wanted her designs to tell a story and be \\"conversation starters\\", so much that she made sure clothing store salespeople knew the stories printed on the skirt, just in case a customer would ask. Manufacturing Girl wearing saddle shoes and a poodle skirt The skirt was easy for people to make at home, since the design was simple and the materials easily available. The original homemade skirt could be made by cutting a circle out of felt for the waist. Then, appliqu√©s could be added on to reflect the person's interests and hobbies. In just a week after the debut of the poodle skirt, Charlot was able to sell the design. As the popularity of her skirt began to grow, she eventually opened her own factory. Popularity Movie stars commonly wore this skirt, and it featured widely in magazines and advertising, and many were eager to keep up with Hollywood's fashions, adding to its popularity. The skirt proved most popular with teenage girls, and in 1952 mail-order catalogs dedicated to poodle skirts were made. Known as the \\"first teenage fashion trend\\", these skirts were perfect for dancing. It could also be said that the skirt's ability to be customized led to its success with teenagers, as it reflected individual personalities. Modern poodle skirts The poodle skirt remains one of the most memorable symbols of 1950s Americana and is frequently worn as a novelty retro item, part of a nostalgic outfit. A similar design of these skirts became popular in the years 2009‚Äì2010. The skirts had been shortened but the newer designs retained the original waistband.

Honda marketed two more models based on the Eve's design. All models utilised a single geared AF05 engine. Honda Eve The first variation of the NQ50 was the Honda Eve, and was exclusive to Japan. * 1983: The Eve was available in red for its first year of production. The bike was missing some vital features, including battery, starter motor, and automatic bystarter. This model also lacked a removable main jet, so tuning was limited without replacing the carburetor with a later model revision. Due to the lack of automatic start, the Eve required a kick start, and there were many issues related to the breaking of the kick start gears. * 1984-1987: The Eve also gained a battery and starter motor, but retained the manual bystarter control mounted underneath the horn switch. A form of hybrid carburetor containing features from both the Spree/Nifty and the previous Eve, including a removable main jet and a slightly bigger intake. Like the Nifty 50, the Eve lacked a dedicated engine stop switch, so the only way to manually stop the engine was to turn the key off. The 1984-87 Eve was available in white, blue, or red. Honda Spree=Model Differences By Year * 1984: The Spree was available in sparkling red (US Only), cortina white, or vista blue (Canada Only) The speedometer design was slightly different from that used in the 1985-7 Sprees, with speed numbers 10-20-30-40 instead of 5-15-25-35. The logo was also much smaller than later years. * 1985: The Spree logo was much larger than the '84 Sprees, making it more visible. * 1986: The Spree got a kick starter. Honda also produced a \\"Special Edition\\" Spree, in shasta white and lollipop green combo. This Spree is now extremely rare. * 1987: The dashboard, front indicators and tail lamps were redesigned for a more aerodynamic shape. Also a glove box was added behind the shield or front of the scooter, underneath the handlebars and in front of the floorboard. Iowa Edition The Iowa Edition Spree was a restricted version that utilized a restricted muffler, smaller main jet and a 12:83 (6.917) gear ratio in order to comply with Iowa laws on the use of mopeds. It was limited in top speed to 25mph. The 1987 Iowa Edition Spree is a very rare model. Honda Nifty 50=AU * 1984-1987: The Nifty was available in red or dark blue; the latter seems most common. The main visible difference from the Spree is the round headlight and the curved edges of the dashboard. EU * 1984: The Nifty was available in red or dark blue; The main visible difference from the Spree is the round headlight and the curved edges of the dashboard. The front headlights are mounted upside down on the underside of the handlebars. The luggage rack is simpler than the Spree's, and the rear lights are mounted either side of the number plate mount rather than on the luggage rack tubing. * 1985: The EU Nifty was identical to the 1984 and '85, with the exceptions of different labels and stickers, and a square red start button rather than a round yellow. Neither of the Niftys included an engine stop switch above the engine start switch, so the only proper way of stopping the engine was to turn off the ignition.

For example, LGBT, conversion from Islam and freedom to women are punishable by death. The enforcement mechanisms designed to help protect human rights, are relatively new in Kuwait, with limited independent oversight from Kuwaiti courts or NGOs.  Teachers  Workers Union Obtains International Court Order for Foreign Teachers Against Threats by Kuwaiti Ministry of Education Quotable: ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòforeign workers‚Äô in this case are not some privileged visitors... they are also mostly ethnic Arabs from other ‚Äòdeveloping‚Äô countries... which also suffered damages from wars and revolutions. So this... is a case of the shared struggle of all peoples in the Middle East striving to collectively escape from poverty.‚Äù ‚Äì Prince Judge Matthew of Thebes Press Release: The Human Rights Court Division of the Sovereign Court of International Justice (SCIJ), an inter-governmental organization (IGO) of the independent Judiciary profession, issued a Preliminary Court Order on 05 August 2017, opening a class action civil lawsuit and also criminal investigation against the State of Kuwait, for claims of decades of unpaid wages of thousands of foreign teachers, allegedly driven by a policy of discrimination. The Court ruling also issued a protective order against public threats by the Kuwaiti Ministry of Education overtly intimidating workers into not seeking access to Justice with the international Judiciary. Ashraf Ali Abouelella, Chief Administrator of the plaintiff Workers Rights International, described the Court case in this way: ‚ÄúThe foreign teachers employed by the Ministry of Education served as public role models of dedication to the general welfare of Kuwait. A whole generation of the youth of Kuwait graduated with quality education thanks to their efforts. As a result, the State of Kuwait has flourished. However, instead of returning the favor to those who were the reason for its renaissance by education, Kuwait continued to deprive them of their contractual and statutory rights, and thus constitutional rights, thereby violating international human rights.‚Äù Prince Judge Matthew of Thebes, a Barrister and Privy Council facilitating the case with the international Judiciary, noted: ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòforeign workers‚Äô in this case are not some privileged visitors from dominant countries with strong economies. Like the Kuwaitis, they are also mostly ethnic Arabs from other ‚Äòdeveloping‚Äô countries in the Middle East with disadvantaged economies and widespread poverty, which also suffered damages from wars and revolutions. So this is not a case of protecting national interests for some balance with more prosperous countries. It is a case of the shared struggle of all peoples in the Middle East striving to collectively escape from poverty, by working to stimulate and elevate the economies of all countries throughout the region.‚Äù For several years, newspaper articles worldwide have described a national crisis which has been escalating to educational workers pursuing lawsuits with international courts against the State of Kuwait for discriminatory non-payment and deprivation of wages by its Ministry of Education as violations of constitutional rights and human rights. The Kuwait Court of Appeal issued a Judgment ruling that contractual and statutory payments must be equally applied to foreign workers generally (Madkour v. Ministry of Education, April 2013). The Kuwait Constitutional Court issued a Judgment ruling that discrimination denying a class equal pay for equal work is unconstitutional, and that unpaid statutory benefits to foreign workers must be paid retroactively (Female Educational Workers, October 2016). However, these and other Judgments of the Kuwaiti High Courts have been mostly disregarded, and defiantly ignored by the government agencies responsible for payment. As a result, the plaintiff workers union appealed to the Sovereign Court of International Justice (SCIJ) essentially seeking international enforcement of those binding legal precedents by the Kuwaiti High Courts. Officials of the Ministry of Education publicly denied the need for an international Judiciary process, arguing that Kuwait ‚Äúhas a fair Judiciary, which can be resorted to in order to resolve any grievances or problems‚Äù. A spokesperson for the Sovereign Court (SCIJ) responded: ‚ÄúWe agree that the High Courts of Kuwait have upheld the highest Judiciary standards, consistently ordering the enforcement of foreign workers rights. The problem is that the Ministries ordered by those excellent national Courts to pay all workers systemically ignore and defy their own Kuwaiti Courts. That is precisely why the international Judiciary is needed, for a higher level of enforcement, addressing violations of a higher rule of law.‚Äù Officials of the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance and even the Parliament of Kuwait have refused payment and blocked budgets otherwise available for payment, claiming ‚Äúbudget failure‚Äù and legislative efforts to impose an ‚Äúausterity plan‚Äù, as an excuse for disregarding the rulings of the Kuwaiti High Courts. However, lawyers for the plaintiffs point out that Kuwait must have reserves from its previous record-high surplus budgets in 2005, 2008, 2012 and 2013, which in 2005 peaked at 43% of Kuwait's gross domestic product (GDP), and argue that from those years it had many opportunities to fully pay all wages owed to all workers. In direct and immediate response to social media rumors of the plaintiffs planning to appeal to the international Judiciary, the Ministry of Education publicly made aggressive threats through Kuwaiti newspapers, both in English and Arabic: ‚ÄúMinistry of Education will not stand idle in the face of these measures, which affect the country‚Äôs reputation in international forums. Firm actions will be taken against any teacher who harms Kuwait‚Äôs reputation. If any teacher is proven to have done so, his/her service will be terminated. ‚Ä¶ Kuwait‚Äôs reputation is the ‚ÄòRed Line‚Äô and no one will be allowed to tarnish the image of the ‚ÄòState of Humanity‚Äô.‚Äù The Court Order by the Sovereign Court (SCIJ) held that ‚ÄúIn international law, a State has limited rights to protect its reputation only against a ‚Äòcampaign‚Äô of ‚Äòpropaganda‚Äô by another State which undermines its ‚Äòsovereignty and political independence‚Äô... A State most certainly has no reputational rights whatsoever against private persons seeking to assert their lawful rights. ... A State is solely responsible for the consequences to its reputation from its own policies and its own official actions towards the people living and working on its own territory.‚Äù The advocacy group Migrant-Rights.org has documented a history of such threats by the Kuwaiti Ministry against foreign workers planning lawsuits, who ‚Äúwere threatened with losing their jobs, no matter the outcome of the Court order.‚Äù The Court ruled that ‚Äúit is a universal criminal offense to intimidate a victim of rights violations by threatening ‚Äòretaliation‚Äô, specifically including threats against their ‚Äòlawful employment or livelihood‚Äô, to prevent their asserting lawful rights... This major violation constitutes the international crime of ‚Äòvictim intimidation‚Äô.\\" A spokesperson for the Court noted that it was those last-minute public threats by the Kuwait Ministry which compelled the Presiding Judges to additionally open the criminal investigation, which was not previously planned. The founder of the trade union Workers Rights International, the Egyptian teacher Ashraf Ali Abouelella, as the primary member of the plaintiff class, was employed by the Kuwaiti Ministry of Education for 20 years and 7 months since 1992, and has persisted in pursuing his legal claim of unpaid wages throughout 26 years. The trade union Workers Rights International is represented by Doctor Galal Wadnan Elaboudi of the Egyptian law firm International Center for Legal Consultancy (ICLC). The union's class action lawsuit was directly joined by the first group of 104 workers, most from Egypt, with a few from Jordan and Syria. The larger class consists of an estimated 20,000 foreign teachers employed by Kuwait, who are also affected by Judgments regarding this plaintiff group. Treaties Kuwait is a party to several international human rights treaties, including *International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights *Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination *Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women *Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery *Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others *United Nations Convention Against Torture *Convention on the Rights of the Child *Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour *Convention concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour *Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention *Abolition of Forced Labour Convention *Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention *Convention against Discrimination in Education Migrant workers Thousands of migrant workers are subjected to conditions of involuntary servitude by employers in Kuwait. The workers were subject to physical and sexual abuse, non-payment of wages, poor work conditions, threats, confinement to the home, and withholding of passports to restrict their freedom of movement. Repeated abusers include M A Al-Kharafi & Sons and its subsidiary Kharafi National that have been cited by human rights organizations and the United States Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Kuwait. Bedoon There are 100,000 Bedoon in Kuwait. The Bedoon are reportedly stateless people. The Kuwaiti government believes most Bidoon are foreign nationals from neighboring countries. Kuwait considers the Bedoon illegal immigrants. Women's rights Kuwaiti women are among the most emancipated women in the Middle East region. In 2014 and 2015, Kuwait was ranked first among Arab countries in the Global Gender Gap Report. In 2013, 53% of Kuwaiti women participated in the labor force. Kuwaiti women outnumber men in the workforce. At the end of a 9-day visit to Kuwait on 15 December 2016, the UN Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in practice praised Kuwait for its achievements in education and in the labour force, but warned against the persistent barriers, both in law and in practice, on the path of women's quest for full equality UN human rights experts Alda Facio and Kamala Chandrakirana said despite significant achievements, ‚Äúdiscrimination against women persists in law and in practice, particularly in the context of the family and nationality laws, based on the presumption of women‚Äôs dependence on men, which is contrary to the principle of equality.‚Äù Muslim women in Kuwait are discriminated under the family law. Children born to a Kuwaiti mother and non-Kuwaiti father do not get Kuwaiti citizenship, unless a decree is passed by the Minister of Interior. LGBT Rights  LGBT people living in Kuwait may face discriminatory laws and public attitudes. Homosexuality and transgenderism are widely seen as being immoral activities, often attributed to foreign influences. The law punishes these activities as debauchery, public immorality and even offending the recognised teachings of Islam. In 2017 Saudi Instagram star King Luxy was arrested in Kuwait for allegedly looking too feminine. He spent 2 weeks in custody before he was released. Media freedom All forms of news and entertainment media, is subject to government censorship. Content that embarrasses or insults members of the royal family or religious leaders or recognized religious values, is prohibited. Content that features nudity, sexual behavior or anything that is pornographic or expresses support for liberal sexual attitudes, is prohibited. According to a 2009 report from the Reporters without Borders, Kuwait is engaged in pervasive Internet filtering and selective filtering in security areas. The primary target of Internet filtering is pornography.

It is an adaptation of the Snow White story. Although it failed to secure its lead actress stardom, it is considered as a classic of pornochanchada genre with blending chanchada, elements of softcore, a superficial content, and a vulgar sense of humour. The film features an Afro-Brazilian actress, Adele F√°tima, as Snow White. Snow White is not named \\"White\\" (branca) but clara (a Brazilian racial term similar to \\"high yellow\\", morena clara in full). Also the name \\"Clara das Neves\\" may be read as a real person's name. The forest in the film is a jungle home to wild animals such as jaguars, monkeys, and some odd white rabbits. Snow White dances to a samba-can√ß√£o played and sung by the Dwarfs. Characters of the Dwarfs are influenced by the Disney movie. Synopsis Snow White lives in the castle with her father and her stepmother. Prince is her stepmother's lover. Her father dies and her stepmother banishes Snow White. Prince and Snow White meet accidentally and start a love affair. Queen witnesses this affair and commissions a hunter (played by Costinha, a veteran Brazilian comedian) to kill Snow White. Snow White offers herself to the hunter to survive. She then flees to the forest. She is found unconscious by the Seven Dwarfs and taken to their cottage. Six of the Dwarfs (except Grumpy (Zangado) who is gay) make advances to sleep with Snow White. Queen learning from the mirror that she is still alive and happier, commits suicide by eating a poisonous apple. Prince goes into the forest to find Snow White. To end the conflict, Dwarfs decide to draw lots and Dopey (Dunga) wins. Snow White finds out that Dopey possesses a huge virile member. Next day, Prince arrives at the cottage to take Snow White. She refuses, telling the Prince that Dopey is her lover. Prince takes the tempting Grumpy instead.

Today, as historically, Manitou Camp is used as a campground and as a facility for fishing.National Register of Historical Places - WISCONSIN (WI), Ashland County It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1983 and is owned by the National Park Service. In the 1890s four Swedes who were cutting cedar on the island built a cabin in a northern European style. Their cabin remains at the camp to this day, built of cedar logs hand- flattened on two sides, joined with half-dove-tailed notches, chinked with moss, with a small cellar beneath a trapdoor in the floor. When the Swedes finished logging three of them left, but John Hanson stayed on. Hanson fished year-round, smoked meat, gardened, and had a horse on this remote island. He built a twine shed which remains today. He was joined by a Frenchman, Gus Plud. In the 1920s or 1930s Frank Childs built a cabin there and fished in the winter with a man named Black Pete. In the early 1930s John Hanson built a smokehouse for smoking herring and venison. Later a Captain Bark winter-fished from the camp. One objective of these fishermen was the November‚ÄìDecember herring run. The herring were cleaned and salted right at Manitou camp, then packed into barrels for transport to Bayfield. After the lake froze, the fishermen drove dogsleds out over the ice. They hung gill nets on lines and poles under the ice and after a day or two, collected a catch of whitefish and lake trout. (One wooden fish sled remains at the camp.) In the 1930s two Norwegian brothers, Theodore and Hjalmer Olson, fished out of Manitou Camp in winters. In 1938 they bought the camp and lived there year-round. They constructed a 14 by 18 foot log bunkhouse in a Scandinavian style, which remains, and a twine shed for storing fishing nets. The Olsons rented cabins to loggers and fishermen, and lived at Manitou camp at least into the 1980s. Around camp there are also a couple old outhouses, a handmade windlass, boat skids, the remains of a pier, handmade fish boxes, a net reel, a net fork, tarring tank, gutting board, and salt barrels. These remnants of the fishing industry remain where they were used and left. That they were not cleaned up and redeveloped like the valuable land around most docks is what makes Manitou Camp unique in the area.

He served as Archbishop of Luanda from 1986 to 2001 and was made a cardinal in 1983. Biography Born in Malanje, do Nascimento studied at the seminaries in Banglas, Malanje, and Luanda before traveling to Rome in 1948 to study at the Pontifical Gregorian University, from where he obtained his baccalaureate in philosophy and his licentiate in theology. He was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Luigi Traglia on 20 December 1952, and then taught dogmatic theology at the Luanda seminary and served as chief editor of the Catholic newspaper O apostolado until 1956, whence he became preacher of the metropolitan cathedral. In 1961, with the outbreak of the War of Independence, Nascimento was forced to enter exile in Lisbon. Whilst in Portugal, he did pastoral work, served as a counselor to the Movement of Teams of Our Lady, and studied civil law at the Classical University. Upon returning to Angola in 1971, he taught moral theology at the Pius XII Institute of Social Sciences, and served as an official of the archdiocesan curia of Lubango, secretary general of the Angolan C√°ritas, and special assistant to students and former political prisoners. On 10 August 1975, Nascimento was appointed the fourth bishop of Malanje by Pope Paul VI.

Eldest son of the prime minister Robert Peel, he was educated at Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford and entered the Diplomatic Service in 1844. He served as co-member for Tamworth, his father's constituency, from 1850 until 1880, for Huntingdon from 1884 and for Blackburn from 1885 to 1886. He was appointed Irish secretary in 1861 in Palmerston's ministry, but in 1865, under Russell he was replaced by Chichester Fortescue. He was appointed a GCB in 1866. His variety of parties and tendency not to toe the party line saw republication of a charge of moral want, volatility and 'lack of dignity' from pre-Liberal landslide biographies after his death such as the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography which mention signs of general profligacy and of his rift from his wife. Background and education Born in London on 4 May 1822, Peel was the eldest son of Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, the statesman, and Julia, daughter of Sir John Floyd, 1st Baronet. He went to Harrow School in February 1835. He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford on 26 May 1841, but did not take a degree. Diplomatic career Entering the diplomatic service, he became an attach√© to the British legation at Madrid on 18 June 1844. He was promoted to be secretary of legation in Switzerland on 2 May 1846, and was charg√© d'affaires there in November 1846. On his father's death, on 2 July 1850, and his own succession to the baronetcy, he resigned his office at Bern(e). Political career Entering the House of Commons as the 'Liberal- Conservative' (i.e. as one of the Peelites) member for his father's former constituency, Tamworth, on 19 July 1850, he had every opportunity open to him of taking a distinguished place in public life. He had a fine presence and gaiety of manner, and was popular in social life; while his oratorical gifts ‚Äì a rich ringing voice, a perfect command of language, rare powers of irony, a capacity for producing unexpected rhetorical effects ‚Äì ought to have rendered his success in parliament a certainty. But he used his abilities fitfully. The want of moral fibre in his volatile character, an absence of dignity, and an inability to accept a fixed political creed, prevented him from acquiring the confidence of his associates or of the public. On 24 April 1854 he was shipwrecked off the coast of Genoa in the SS Ercolano, and only saved his life by swimming ashore on some portion of the wreck. From 29 March 1854 to 1859 he served as a captain in the Staffordshire Yeomanry. In March 1855 Lord Palmerston, who had been Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs while Peel was in the diplomatic service, appointed him a junior Civil Lord of the Admiralty. Henceforth he was regarded as a Liberal, and his persistent advocacy of the liberation of Italy fully justified this view of his political opinions. In July 1856 he acted as secretary to Lord Granville's special mission to Russia at the coronation of Alexander II. On 5 January 1857, during a lecture delivered at the opening of the new library at Adderley Park, near Birmingham, he spoke discourteously of the Russian court and the court officials. The lecture, severely commented on by the Russian and French press, was the subject of a parliamentary debate, and caused great annoyance to the English court. Nevertheless, on Palmerston's return to power, he, on 26 July 1861, made Peel Chief Secretary for Ireland and a privy councillor. In this position his careless good humour pleased the Irish and the prime minister, and he almost thought he had solved the Irish question when he made excursions incognito through the country on a jaunting-car and interviewed the peasants. His speeches were very optimistic; but, before his connection with the castle ended, fenianism came to a head. Irish debates became more embittered, and his replies and speeches in parliament lacked discretion and were not calculated to promote peace. In February 1862 he received a challenge from the O'Donoghue, but the matter was brought before the commons on 25 February and was adjusted. Although he took a warm interest in some Irish questions, especially higher education, which he had aided by a handsome contribution to the Queen's Colleges founded by his father, his career in Ireland was a failure. When the Liberal government was reconstituted, after the death of Lord Palmerston, by Lord John Russell, to whom Peel's failings were peculiarly obnoxious his post was filled by Chichester Fortescue and he did not again hold office. On 5 January 1866 he was created G.C.B.. Vanity Fair, March 1870 He continued to sit for Tamworth as a Liberal, but was often a severe critic of Mr. Gladstone's policy. In 1871 he gave a remarkable proof of his eloquence by describing to the House the rout, which he had himself witnessed, of the French army of General Bourbaki, and its flight over the Swiss frontier in the depth of winter during the Franco-Prussian War. In 1874 he for a second time christened himself a Liberal-Conservative; and when the eastern question, during Lord Beaconsfield's administration, came to the front, he wholly separated himself from the followers of Mr. Gladstone. He did not stand for Tamworth at the general election in 1880, but unsuccessfully contested Gravesend in the conservative interest; and his voice was often heard on Conservative platforms, denouncing the action of the Liberal administration in Egypt and Ireland. In The Times of 8 May 1880 he published a letter, in which he recounted the offers from various governments of honours and offices which he had refused. On 21 March 1884 he was returned as a Conservative member for Huntingdon. When that borough was disfranchised, he was, in November 1885, returned for Blackburn. On the critical division on the second reading of the Home Rule Bill, on 7 June 1886, he abstained from voting. At the general election in the following July Peel contested the Inverness Burghs for the Liberal party against a Liberal Unionist who had broken with his party on the issue of Home Rule. Peel was not successful. Subsequently, with characteristic impetuosity, he threw himself into the home rule agitation as a supporter of the Irish demands, and at a by-election in 1889 was the Liberal candidate for Brighton, duly advocating (Irish) home rule. Neither of the incumbents returned had been Liberals since the election of 1880 but the by-election was expected to be a closer affair, and polling 39.3% of the vote, he decided not to stand again to be an MP. Horse racing From about 1856 he was extensively engaged in racing under the name of Mr. F. Robinson; and later on had an establishment at Bonehill, near Tamworth, where he bred horses. Later life His father's fine collection of 77 pictures and 18 drawings, including Chapeau de Poil by Rubens, he sold to the National Gallery in March 1871 for .(Parliamentary Papers, 1872, No. 35) Per The Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland (1883)The Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland, John Bateman, 1883 he owned across Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Lancashire yielding an annual rent of ¬£24532. However, in later life his private circumstances, a reckless extravagance and rift from his wife, meant he ceased to live at Drayton Manor, Staffordshire. These circumstances made him a stranger there in his final years. His last public appearance was the week before his death, attending St James's Hall to protest atrocities in Armenia. The Times wrote his obituary to include a statement that his death \\"left no gap in English public life...his career has closed in disappointment and futility.\\" It added \\"he had much of his great father's impressive dignity, though without any of his stiffness, for which, indeed, he substituted a Bohemian easiness of manner.\\" Family Peel married Lady Emily Hay, seventh daughter of George Hay, 8th Marquess of Tweeddale, on 13 January 1856. Twin daughters Gwendolin Cecilia and Agnes Helen (1860-1964) were born in 1860 followed by Victoria Alexandrina Julia (1865-1935), Robert (1867-1925) and Evelyn Emily (1869-1960). On 9 May 1895, aged 73, Peel died from h√¶morrhage on the brain. He was found dead in his bedroom at 12 Stratton Street, London. His valet had to enter his room via a window and summoned his doctor from Harley Street.The Times (London, England), Friday, May 10, 1895, Issue 34573, p.10: Sir Robert Peel He was buried at Drayton Bassett's Anglican church on 16 May.

It premiered on the Fox network on April 22, 1994. \\"Born Again\\" was written by Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa, and directed by Jerrold Freedman. The episode featured guest appearances by Brian Markinson and Maggie Wheeler. The episode is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the series' wider mythology. \\"Born Again\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.2, being watched by 7.7 million households in its initial broadcast, and received mixed reviews from critics. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. When Mulder and Scully are called to New York to investigate the death of a police officer, they come to believe that a young girl present at the incident may be the reincarnation of another officer murdered years earlier. Several crew members disliked the episode, most notably writer Howard Gordon and David Duchovny. Gordon felt that the episode was too similar to the other episodes that had been aired, whereas Duchovny bluntly stated that he \\"detested\\" the episode. Plot In Buffalo, New York, police detective Sharon Lazard finds a little girl, Michelle Bishop, alone in an alley. Lazard takes the seemingly lost girl into her precinct, and leaves her alone to be interviewed by another detective, Rudolph Barbala. However, moments later, Barbala is launched through a window, falling to his death. Lazard turns to Fox Mulder and Dana Scully for help. She tells them of Michelle's claims that a man had attacked Barbala, even though she was the only person in the room when the detective was killed. The agents have Michelle describe the alleged attacker for a computerized facial composite; the computer seemingly glitches, displaying a face that Michelle identifies as the killer. The composite matches that of a Detective Charlie Morris ‚Äî who died nine years previously in an apparent gangland hit. Mulder speaks to Michelle's psychiatrist, Dr. Braun, who tells him that she habitually mutilated dolls in a uniform manner during their sessions together, removing the same eye and arm each time; Mulder realizes that these mutilations match the circumstances of Morris' death. The agents interview Tony Fiore, Morris' ex-partner, who attributes his death to a triad gang they had been investigating together. Later that day, Fiore meets with a Leon Felder to discuss claiming a large sum of money from a safety deposit box. The two men agree that they haven't waited the ten years they had intended to, ominously discussing that they are the last two claimants left. That night, Felder gets off a bus, but his scarf catches in the door, seemingly moved by an invisible force, as the bus drives off. The driver tries to brake, but the bus inexplicably continues to accelerate, strangling Felder. Michelle watches from inside the bus. Investigating further, Mulder and Scully learn that Fiore, Barbala, Felder and Morris had all worked closely together in the past. They also find that Fiore's wife Anita keeps a collection of origami animals made by her first husband‚ÄîCharlie Morris. Anita tells the agents that Fiore hasn't returned home from the previous night; meanwhile, the agents find that pages are missing from the file on Morris' murder, and Fiore was the last one to have checked the file out. Michelle undergoes a session of regression hypnosis, where she claims to be twenty-four years old. She suddenly starts screaming in panic about someone trying to kill her, and the session is ended. Mulder reviews the video of the session, and is convinced that the girl is the reincarnation of Morris, having been conceived right around the time the detective was murdered. The tape contains a brief section of static noise just before Michelle begins screaming, which Mulder has an expert clean up. The noise is found to contain a grainy image of what appears to be a fish tank ornament of a man in an atmospheric diving suit. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Morris' autopsy findings, which show the presence of salt water in his respiratory tract, indicating he died of drowning. The agents realise from these findings that Morris was drowned in the exotic fish tank in Fiore's house. Rushing to Fiore's house, Mulder and Scully find Michelle using telekinetic powers to try to kill Fiore. They prevent her from doing so, and Fiore confesses that he, Felder and Barbala had stolen a large sum of money, intending to keep it safe for ten years before claiming it. Morris learned of their plan and threatened to report on them, and was consequently killed to silence him. However, Fiore maintains that he never wanted to see Morris dead and only wanted to take care of Anita after his death. Michelle uses her powers to destroy the fish-tank, but spares Fiore after hearing pleas from Anita not to hurt him. Later, Fiore pleads guilty to charges of murder and grand larceny, whilst Michelle seemingly recovers and goes on to become a normal little girl.Lowry, pp.150‚Äì151Lovece, pp.98‚Äì100 Production Writer Howard Gordon was disappointed with the episode, finding it too similar to other series being aired around the same time. He also believed that the episode seemed \\"a little too cop show-y\\" overall,Lowry, p.151 stating that he did not think it \\"was very well executed on any front\\". David Duchovny also reportedly \\"detested\\" the episode, despite a guest appearance by his then-girlfriend Maggie Wheeler.Lovece, p.100 Executive producer R. W. Goodwin recalls being on location for the episode's opening scene, in which Detective Barbala is thrown from a window. The room used for the scene had two windows side-by-side, and one had been replaced with sugar glass for the stunt. When the false window was blown out to simulate someone being thrown through it, the crew found that the glass window beside the false one had also accidentally been blown out. The episode's key grip, Al Campbell, suggested that the next shot show Barbala's dog lying beside his body to explain the second window breaking.Edwards, pp.74‚Äì75 Broadcast and reception \\"Born Again\\" premiered on the Fox network on April 22, 1994, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on February 23, 1995. This episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.2, with a 14 share, meaning that in the US, roughly 8.2 percent of all television-equipped households, and 14 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 7.7 million households.Lowry, p.248 Writer Howard Gordon has expressed his disappointment with the episode, feeling that it was too similar to his earlier work on the episode \\"Shadows\\", and finding that it was \\"not done particularly interestingly\\". Series creator Chris Carter also felt that \\"Born Again\\" was \\"just not one of [his] favorites\\", adding that he \\"thought the direction was a little sloppy, but it's one of those episodes that plays a little closer to reality and I like that about it\\".Edwards, p.74 In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly, \\"Born Again\\" was rated a B‚àí, with the episode being described as \\"engaging but ultimately just serviceable\\", although Andrea Libman's casting as Michelle was called \\"inspired\\". Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, felt negatively towards the episode, feeling that its plot was too reminiscent of earlier episodes, such as \\"Eve\\" or \\"Shadows\\". However, he found the scene in which an image is found in the static of a video recording to have been a highlight, calling it \\"a cool combination of hard science and the inexplicable\\". Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, was favorable towards the episode, again praising the performance of Libman as Michelle. He also drew comparisons to \\"Shadows\\", but felt that \\"Born Again\\" was the better episode of the two.

He controls the holding company Caltagirone S.p.A. with interests in cement manufacturing, real estate, construction and publishing (with Caltagirone Editore). As of 2015, Caltagirone was ranked number #894 on the 2015 Forbes billionaire list and #19 in Italy, with an estimated net worth of $2.1 billion. Biography Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone was born in Rome into a large family composed almost entirely of manufacturers. His grandfather constructed the first buildings in Palermo in the last decades of the 1800s. While studying at the faculty of engineering in Rome, Caltagirone and his brothers Edoardo Francesco Caltagirone and Leonardo Francesco Caltagirone resumed the family business that had been interrupted in the forties because of the sudden death of their father. With the inherited capital, the brothers started the company together with their cousin Gaetano Caltagirone, an architect already working as a manufacturer. Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone became a partner in the company. Since then the group (today known as the Caltagirone Group or Caltagirone S.p.A) has constructed approximately 200 real estate complexes, composed of nearly 800 buildings with a total area of close to 3.3 million square metres and a value of ‚Ç¨15 billion. In the seventies the equity balance between Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and his cousin Gaetano Caltagirone was changed, and Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone became part of the majority shareholders ‚Äì on an equal footing with his brother Edoardo Francesco Caltagirone. In 1984 he took over Vianini Lavori S.p.A. ‚Äì now part of the Caltagirone Group ‚Äì which operates worldwide in the field of large infrastructure project. He became president of the company.

In a few years, under the guidance of his son Francesco Caltagirone Jr., Cementir S.p.A became a multinational company with significant presence in Scandinavia, Turkey and the Far East. About 80% of the turnover is produced outside Italy. In the mid-nineties he assumed full control of the Caltagirone Group joining his shares with those of his cousin Gaetano Caltagirone in the company Finanziaria Italia. Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone holds approximately 70% of Finanziaria Italia, which controls about 51% of Caltagirone S.p.A. In 1996 he acquired the Roman newspaper Il Messaggero from the Montedison Group, and the following year two local newspapers from private investors: Il Mattino based in Naples and Il Corriere Adriatico based in Ancona. Since 2000 all publishing and new media have been clustered in the Caltagirone Editore publishing group ‚Äì the fifth biggest group in Italy.

In practice, the RFA has been an interesting and much-imitated attempt to \\"scale\\" the actions of the federal government to the size of the groups and organizations affected. Passed in 1980, the RFA has been gradually strengthened in the intervening years, and has historically enjoyed strong bipartisan support. Since the federal government began calculating the economic impact of the RFA in 1998, the law is estimated to have saved small entities (and the U.S. economy as a whole) more than $200 billion without undermining the broad purposes of the regulations it affects. More than 40 U.S. states, as well as a number of other nations, have adopted similar approaches.  History  The origins of the RFA can be traced back to expressions of discontent about federal regulations by businesses from the 1930s onward, but the urgency of these concerns increased sharply as new federal agencies were created, and older ones given fresh mandates to pursue, in the 1960s and 1970s. Studies of the economic role of smaller businesses in the 1970s showed links to the growth of overall employment and technological innovation. These factors, together with the increasing political assertiveness of U.S. small businesses, provided impetus for a series of laws enacted from 1976-1984 including the RFA, the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Small Business Development Center Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), the Small Business Innovation Research Act (SBIR), and the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA). The first in this line of laws was enacted in June 1976, when President Gerald Ford signed Public Law 94-305 creating an Office of Advocacy within the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), and giving that Office responsibility for assessing the impact of federal regulations on small firms. The law called on the Office of Advocacy to \\"measure the direct costs and other effects of government regulation on small businesses; and make legislative and nonlegislative proposals for eliminating excessive or unnecessary regulations of small businesses.\\" This was a significant recognition of the issue of scale in federal regulations, but its remedies‚Äîmeasuring effects and offering proposals‚Äîwere incomplete. On August 1, 1977, Senators Gaylord Nelson (D, WI) and John Culver (D, IA) introduced the earliest version of the Regulatory Flexibility Act in Congress. Their bill directed federal agencies to actually seek less burdensome regulations for small businesses, and assigned responsibility to the new Office of Advocacy to monitor compliance. Following several hearings, the bill was revised in a number of ways, notably by including small nonprofit organizations and small governmental bodies within its jurisdiction. The legislation attracted more than 70 of the Senate's 100 members as co-sponsors, and passed the U.S. Senate unanimously in October 1978, although it was not acted upon by the U.S. House of Representatives until a new Congress convened in 1979. Like later versions of the RFA, the 1977-8 legislation targeted the basic law governing the conduct of all federal agencies, called the Administrative Procedure Act. The RFA amended this statute by designating a new responsibility for federal agencies. Henceforth agencies would be required to assess the impact of their regulations on small entities (small businesses, small nonprofit organizations and small governmental jurisdictions) as a key part of the process for issuing regulations, and to use less burdensome alternatives whenever possible. One of the creative aspects of the RFA was the method that it required the agencies to use. Both Senators Nelson and Culver were noted environmentalists, so they adapted an approach used earlier in the National Environmental Policy Act. Agencies were to develop an \\"initial\\" analysis of the effects of a proposed regulation on small entities (similar to a preliminary environmental impact analysis), seek comments, and then refine these inputs into a \\"final\\" small entity impact analysis (similar to a final environmental impact analysis). In the fall of 1979, as the Regulatory Flexibility Act moved forward in Congress, President Jimmy Carter took steps to advance some of the goals of the legislation administratively. He added the Small Business Administration to his Regulatory Council and issued a memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies, directing them \\"...to make sure that federal regulations will not place unnecessary burdens on small businesses and organizations,\\" and to apply regulations \\"in a flexible manner, taking into account the size and nature of the regulated businesses.\\" Agencies were to report on their efforts to the Office of Advocacy. Meanwhile, the House and Senate Small Business and Judiciary Committees continued to hold hearings on the effects of regulation. Small business representatives cited evidence that uniform application of regulatory requirements made it difficult for smaller businesses to enter into various lines of business and to compete. In January 1980, small business leaders elected by their peers assembled as delegates to the first modern White House Conference on Small Business. The final conference report noted that \\"during the past decade, the growth of government regulation has been explosive, particularly in such areas as affirmative-action hiring, energy conservation, and protection for consumers, workers, and the environment. Small business people recognize that some government regulation is essential for maintaining an orderly society. But there are now 90 agencies issuing thousands of new rules each year.\\" Moreover, the report said, the new Office of Advocacy had estimated that small firms spent $12.7 billion annually on government paperwork. Among the conference recommendations, a top vote-getter was a recommendation calling for \\"sunset review\\" and economic impact analysis of regulations, as well as a regulatory review board with small business representation. The conference delegates recommended putting the onus of measuring regulatory costs on the regulatory agencies‚Äîto \\"require all federal agencies to analyze the cost and relevance of regulations to small businesses.\\"  Requirements of the Act  The White House Conference recommendations lent significant impetus for the passage, in September 1980, of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA). The intent of the act is stated in the notes for the act: > It is the purpose of this Act to establish as a principle of regulatory > issuance that agencies shall endeavor, consistent with the objectives of the > rule and of applicable statutes, to fit regulatory and informational > requirements to the scale of the businesses, organizations, and governmental > jurisdictions subject to regulation. To achieve this principle, agencies are > required to solicit and consider flexible regulatory proposals and to > explain the rationale for their actions to assure that such proposals are > given serious consideration. The Regulatory Flexibility Act was originally passed in 1980 (P.L. 96-354). The act was amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-121), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203), and the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-240). The key requirement of the law is that federal agencies must analyze the impact of their regulatory actions on small entities (small businesses, small non-profit organizations and small jurisdictions of government) and, where the regulatory impact is likely to be \\"significant\\", affecting a \\"substantial number\\" of these small entities, seek less burdensome alternatives for them. Both current and proposed federal regulations are subject to the RFA. The process for seeking these less burdensome alternatives is three-fold. Agencies must: * Solicit views of affected small entities * Consider the views of the SBA Office of Advocacy * Publish an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) and/or a final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) in the Federal Register, or provide a certification that the regulation will have no \\"significant impact\\" The RFA has added important elements of management oversight, predictability and transparency to the federal regulatory process. This is particularly evident in the government- wide semi-annual regulatory agendas that the RFA requires. These documents, now known as \\"unified agendas\\", note all planned federal regulations. Those regulations expected to \\"significantly\\" impact small entities, thereby triggering special analyses under the RFA, are separately indexed, as are those that may affect small entities, but not \\"significantly.\\" The unified agendas also single out anticipated regulations covered by other statutes and executive orders. One of the more ambitious aspects of the RFA is its requirement that federal agencies review all of their existing regulations over a period of ten years and revise those that are duplicative, excessively burdensome, or no longer necessary. Although this RFA provision (Section 610 of the Act) is often ignored by agencies, a plan for this review of existing regulations is likewise published with the unified agendas. It is important to note that the RFA does not compel specific regulatory outcomes. Agencies are required to assess the impacts of their proposed and final rules on small entities, and to select less burdensome alternatives‚Äîor explain why they cannot do so. But they are not required to alter their agency missions or their legal mandates. Like the Administrative Procedure Act that it amends, the RFA primarily defines the required procedural steps in a process. While agency non-compliance with these required steps can (and has) led to suspensions of various regulations by the courts, it is the failure to faithfully observe the process, not the subject matter of the regulations, that has led to these outcomes. The RFA comprises Chapter 6 of Title 5 of the United States Code.  Implementation  The RFA tasked SBA's Office of Advocacy with monitoring agency compliance with the new law. Over the next decade and a half, the Office carried out its mandate, reporting annually on agency compliance to the President and the Congress. Those reports soon made it clear that the law wasn't strong enough. A briefing paper prepared for the 1986 White House Conference on Small Business noted: \\"The effectiveness of the Regulatory Flexibility Act largely depends on small business' awareness of proposed regulations and [their] ability to effectively voice [their] concerns to regulatory agencies. In addition, the courts' ability to review agency compliance with the law is limited.\\" The delegates to the 1986 conference recommended that the RFA be strengthened by requiring agencies to comply and by providing that agency action or inaction be subject to judicial review. President Ronald Reagan's 1987 report on small business noted: \\"Regulations and excessive paperwork place small businesses at a disadvantage in an increasingly competitive world marketplace ... This Administration supports continued deregulation and other reforms to eliminate regulatory obstacles to open competition.\\" But it would take an act of Congress to make judicial review law‚Äîand reaching that consensus needed more time. Regulations' effects on the economic environment for competition also concerned President George H. W. Bush, whose 1992 message in the annual small business report noted: \\"My Administration this year instituted a moratorium on new federal regulations to give federal agencies a chance to review and revise their rules. And we are looking at ways to improve our regulatory process over the long term so that regulations will accomplish their original purpose without hindering economic growth.\\" In early September 1993, Vice President Al Gore's National Partnership for Reinventing Government also urged that the Regulatory Flexibility Act be strengthened by permitting judicial review of agency compliance. A few weeks later, President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 12866, \\"Regulatory Planning and Review\\", designed, among other things, to ease the regulatory burden on small firms. The order required federal agencies to analyze their major regulatory undertakings and to take action to ensure that these regulations achieved the desired results with minimal burden on the U.S. economy. An April 1994 report by the Government Accountability Office reviewed the Office of Advocacy's annual reports on agency compliance with the RFA and concluded: \\"The SBA annual reports indicated agencies' compliance with the RFA has varied widely from one agency to another. ... the RFA does not authorize SBA or any other agency to compel rulemaking agencies to comply with the act's provisions.\\"  The 1995 White House Conference and SBREFA  In June 1995, a third White House Conference on Small Business examined the RFA's weaknesses. Despite the Clinton Administration's support for strengthening the law, as exemplified in the Vice President's recommendation in the National Performance Review, the key element for doing so‚Äîjudicial review of agency compliance‚Äîremained missing. Once again, a White House Conference forcefully addressed the problem. One of its recommendations fine-tuned the regulatory policy recommendations of earlier conferences, asking for specific provisions that would include small firms in the rulemaking process. In October, the Office of Advocacy issued a report, based on research by Thomas Hopkins, that estimated the total costs of process, environmental, and other social and economic regulations to be between $420 billion and $670 billion in 1995. The report estimated that the average cost of regulation was $2,979 per employee for large firms with 500 or more employees and $5,532 per employee for small firms with fewer than 20 employees. (A successor study by Mark Crain, in 2005, documented a similar pattern.) In March 1996, President Clinton acted on the 1995 White House Conference recommendation that was taken up by Congress, by signing Public Law 104-121, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA). The new law finally strengthened the RFA in the way that previous reports and conferences had recommended. Perhaps most significantly, it gave the courts jurisdiction to review agency compliance with the RFA. SBREFA also mandated that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) convene small business advocacy review panels to consult with small entities on regulations expected to have a significant impact on them, before the regulations were published for public comment. Also, the law reaffirmed the authority of the chief counsel for advocacy to file amicus curiae (friend of the court) briefs in appeals brought by small entities from agency final actions. Since 1998, the Office of Advocacy's Annual Reports on RFA Implementation have calculated regulatory cost savings attributable to the RFA. Through FY 2007, these savings have totaled over $200 billion, of which $156 billion are recurring savings each year.  Executive Order 13272  In August 2002, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13272, further implementing the RFA. The Executive Order requires federal agencies to establish written procedures and policies explaining how they measure the impact of their regulatory proposals on small entities and to vet those policies with the Office of Advocacy; to notify the Office of Advocacy before publishing draft rules expected to have a significant small business impact; and to consider the Office of Advocacy's written comments on proposed rules and publish a response with the final rule. E.O. 13272 also requires the Office of Advocacy to provide notification as well as training to all agencies on how to comply with the RFA. These additional requirements permit the Office of Advocacy to work closely with federal agencies in considering the impacts of proposed regulations on small entities.  Implementation  To comply with E.O. 13272, the Office of Advocacy began providing reports to the Office of Management and Budget in September 2003. The Office also instituted an email address (notify.advocacy@sba.gov) for agencies to rapidly transmit their notifications about regulations, and published an RFA compliance guide for agencies. Subsequently, the Office of Advocacy prepared agency training materials, and began training agency personnel throughout the government. Nearly all of the cabinet agencies complied with the E.O. by submitting written plans for compliance to the Office of Advocacy and by making their RFA procedures publicly available. Advocacy, in turn, developed a Regulatory Alerts webpage at http://www.sba.gov/advo/laws/law_regalerts.html to call attention to important pending regulations that may affect small entities. Legislation has been introduced to further enhance the RFA. As agencies adjust their regulatory development processes to accommodate the RFA and E.O. 13272's requirements, the benefits will accrue to small entities. Agencies are making strides in that direction. Since the RFA became law, more than forty state governments have enacted similar requirements through statutes and executive orders. Both the SBA Office of Advocacy and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), an association of state and federal legislators, have drafted \\"model\\" state laws paralleling the RFA.  International regulatory flexibility initiatives  Other nations have drawn upon, and in some cases more fully developed, various elements of the RFA. Multilateral efforts. In 2000, both the European Union (EU) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) adopted broad policy statements in support of small and mid-sized enterprises (SME's) that included provisions on the regulatory treatment of SME's. This subject is also being discussed within the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). The World Bank has contributed significantly to the global dialogue on SME regulatory burdens through its annual \\"Doing Business\\" surveys. EU. The EU's Charter to Support Europe's Small Firms called for \\"better legislation and regulation ‚Äì assessing regulation for its impact on small firms, and where possible simplifying or removing altogether obligations on SMEs\\". In 2003, the EU created a \\"European Business Test Panel\\" to react to the potential impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives, followed, in 2007, by an Action Programme for Reducing Administrative Burdens in the European Union, which includes a series of specific tests of those burdens on SME's. These initiatives were strengthened in the EU's Small Business Act in 2008, which articulates the principle of \\"Think Small First.\\" The EU's \\"Small Business Envoy,\\" somewhat akin to the Office of Advocacy in the U.S., is tasked with monitoring the execution of the \\"Think Small First\\" principle. A recent report on the \\"Think Small First\\" implementation emphasizes the potentially disproportionate burden of EU regulations on Europe's SME's. OECD. On behalf of 46 nations that participated in its drafting, the OECD's Bologna Charter on SME Policies called for a regulatory environment that \\"...does not impose undue burdens on SMEs and is conducive to entrepreneurship, innovation and growth,\\" and agreed on \\"benchmarking the effectiveness of SME policies, regulatory environment and performance, based on data and statistics collected at national and sub-national level, including on electronic commerce.\\" The OECD also has undertaken studies of regulatory reforms affecting SME's in several nations. For example, the Netherlands study, by Scott Jacobs, draws attention to the Dutch Ondernemershuizen, one- stop shops where SME's can articulate their regulatory concerns and obtain problem-solving, and to the panel of 30 entrepreneurs who meet regularly with the Dutch State Secretary to identify further areas for reform. (A 2007 analysis by the World Bank concluded that \\"Dutch regulatory reform is a world leader.\\") Both the EU and the OECD have encouraged their member nations to adopt the International Standard Cost Model to facilitate international comparisons of administrative burdens on business. Some 27 nations now belong to an ISCM information-sharing network. APEC/ASEAN. An APEC / ASEAN policy document identifies Australia, Mexico, Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan as the groups' leaders in SME regulatory reform, and sets forth a framework for further progress in the region through 2014. National actions. Individual nations actively pursuing \\"regulatory flexibility\\" type SME policies include: *Canada *Denmark *Estonia *Hungary *Ireland *Luxembourg *New Zealand *Singapore *South Africa *Sweden *United Kingdom The World Banks annual assessment and ranking of regulatory burdens in 183 countries has highlighted the linkage between reduced SME regulatory burdens and economic development, particularly in emerging markets. Efforts by nations to improve their ranking on this annual survey have resulted in significant reforms. Given this growing support for the flexible regulatory treatment of smaller enterprises by both transnational organizations and individual nations, and perhaps international competitiveness considerations, it seems likely that such approaches will spread further in coming years.

Originally the Vanadis (AKA-49) which was briefly in commission from 9 July 1945 to 27 March 1946, it was converted in 1955 after nine years in the reserve fleet. Thor, named after the Germanic god of thunder, was commissioned on 3 January 1956 and served in that capacity until 2 July 1973 when transferred to the Military Sealift Command (MSC) for brief operation as USNS Thor (T-ARC-4) until April 1974 when the ship was returned to the Maritime Administration for dispoasl. After removal of cable machinery the ship was eventually sold for scrap on 22 September 1977. Thor was one of four Navy cable ships supporting military cable projects from the 1950s until 1984 with construction of . The others were , the other transport conversion, and the two Army designed cable ships, the only ships in the Navy designed and built as cable ships, and which were modernized in the 1980s. USS Vanadis, 1945-1946 Vanadis (AKA-49) was laid down on 18 April 1945 under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1910) at Providence, Rhode Island, by the Walsh- Kaiser Co., Inc. and launched on 8 June 1945 sponsored by Mrs. J. Henry Gill. The ship was named after 76 Freia, a minor planet. Vanadis is an alternative poetic name for Freia, the Germanic goddess of love and beauty. The Navy acquired the ship on 9 July 1945 with commissioning the same day with Lt. Comdr. E. B. Williams in command. Following shakedown out of Hampton Roads, Vanadis arrived at Newport, Rhode Island, on 4 August and began shuttling back and forth between that port and Hampton Roads. In mid-December, the attack cargo ship headed for the Gulf of Mexico. After visiting Mobile, Alabama; Gulfport, Mississippi; and Jacksonville, Florida, she arrived at Boston. On 6 February, she reported to the Commandant, 1st Naval District, for inactivation. Vanadis was placed out of commission on 27 March 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 5 June 1946; and, on 2 July, she was transferred to the Maritime Commission. USS Thor After almost nine years of inactivity ‚Äî berthed with the National Defense Reserve Fleet at James River, Virginia ‚Äî Vanadis was reacquired by the Navy on 14 April 1955 and reinstated on the Navy List as AKA-49. On 30 June, she entered the Bethlehem Steel Co.'s yard at Baltimore, Maryland, for conversion to a cable repair ship. She was redesignated ARC-4 and renamed Thor on 14 November 1955. On 3 January 1956, Thor completed her conversion and was recommissioned, Comdr. R. H. Thomas in command. Thor was converted to support the installation of the Sound Surveillance System and other defense cable projects. The system and name were at the time classified with the unclassified name Project Caesar being given to the installation and support of the system.  Function  Navy cable repair ship cable control as installed mid 1950s seen aboard Thor. The ship was principally used to transport, deploy, retrieve and repair cables and to conduct acoustic, hydrographic, and bathymetric surveys under Project Caesar. Civilian specialist are involved during cable or surveying operations for the technical work.SOSUS and both operations and actual linkage of Project Caesar to SOSUS was at the time classified and tightly controlled. The system was covered as \\"oceanographic research\\" and the cable operations were not associated with undersea surveillance systems. Thus any public information, such as the referenced All Hands articles, did not describe the true nature of the operations. The All Hands January 1964 article emphasizes the cover story with the purpose being to connect remote ocean observation centers with shore stations. The Thor and Aeolus had three diameter cable tanks each with a capacity of about of five inch armored cable or of coaxial cable.See USS Aeolus Association's photo of Caesar cable types. Cable being laid was under constant test by civilian experts in the ships cable test room. Cable ships with bow sheaves only required towing astern for some long runs of cable resulting in the unusual feature of two sets of running lights suitable for the stern becoming the effective bow. By the late 1970s the two Artemis class transports converted to cable ships were in need of modernization or replacement. Some shortcomings in design worked against modernization even though two other ships of the same age were slated for major modernization. The class had been designed with a relatively shallow draft of , least draft of the attack transports that had drafts from to .A lesser draft might have some advantages in an attack transport allowing closer approach to beaches. Compared to the draft of the smaller and , designed as an Army cable layers late in World War II and the only Navy ships designed as cable ships, this was a disadvantage in a cable ship's loading and operations. Both of those ships, built the same year and as old, were essentially rebuilt to extend their service life but the two larger ships were not going to be modernized. The shallow draft, which also hindered bathymetric survey work due to shallow transducer depth, and large sail area of the exposed hull and superstructure made stopped or very low speed cable operations hazardous. Thrusters could not be built into the shallow draft hulls and tugs had to be used for some operations. The ships had no stern cable capability and could not effectively be modernized for that capability. Finally, the ships could not carry a full load of cable and a full load of fuel without exceeding maximum draft limits and modernization would only add to that limitation by adding weight. Service history= 1956-1961  The cable repair ship operated in the Atlantic through 1956. In February 1957, she reported to the Pacific Fleet and, until the fall of 1958, operated out of San Francisco repairing and laying cables. She returned to the Atlantic in September 1958 and served there until the summer of 1961, when she was temporarily assigned to the Pacific again. The cable repair ship returned to operations in the Atlantic in December.  1962-1969  USS Thor (ARC-4) lays the shore end of a cable, circa 1963. Floats hold the cable in position for sinking. Following an overhaul at Boston in the spring of 1962, Thor deployed to the Pacific once more for cable repair operations in the northern reaches of that ocean. In October, she returned to the eastern side of the Isthmus of Panama and busied herself with cable repair duties and oceanographic projects in the Caribbean. For the next five and one-half years, Thor continued to repair and lay cables in the western Atlantic and in the West Indies. Occasionally, she also participated in more oceanographic projects. During that half decade, she ranged as far north as Nova Scotia and as far south as the Caribbean. Periodically, she also conducted operations in the Gulf of Mexico. On 20 April 1968, the ship departed Norfolk and steamed, via the Panama Canal and San Diego, for the Central Pacific. She conducted special operations in the vicinity of Midway Island and returned to Hawaii on 16 June for several days before departing Pearl Harbor on the 24th for the Marianas. She reached Guam on 5 July and spent the next month repairing cable around that island. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 August and operated in the Hawaiian Islands until she headed back toward the mainland on 7 November. Following a brief stop at Long Beach, California, Thor returned to Norfolk on 6 December. Over the next four years, Thor deployed to the Pacific three times. In August 1969, after seven months of operations along the east coast, she headed, via the Panama Canal and San Diego, to Pearl Harbor. Through November, she conducted operations near Midway Island and then returned to the Atlantic via Pearl Harbor, Long Beach, and the Panama Canal.  1970-1974  In February 1970, she entered the Bethlehem Steel Shipyard in Boston to begin a year-long overhaul and repair period. In mid-February 1971, the cable repair ship resumed normal operations until late June when she deployed to the Pacific once more. She reached Hawaii on 29 July and departed again on 9 August for cable operations in the northernmost reaches of the Pacific, near the Aleutians chain. She completed those repairs late in the month and, after visits to Esquimalt, British Columbia, and San Diego, transited the canal on 20 September and arrived in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, eight days later. During the first seven months of 1972, the cable repair ship operated along the eastern seaboard again. On 24 July, Thor departed Norfolk for her last assignment in the Pacific Ocean. She arrived at Alameda, California, on 11 August and conducted cable laying operations from there into late November. On the 24th, the ship cleared Alameda. She passed through the Panama Canal on 4 December and arrived back at Portsmouth on the 12th. On 17 January 1973, Thor embarked upon her last overseas cruise as a commissioned ship in the Navy. She arrived in Swansea, Wales, 10 days later and, after two days in port, put to sea for cable operations. From 14 February to 18 February, she visited the Submarine Base at Holy Loch, Scotland, before resuming cable operations near the Arctic Circle. She completed her assignment at the end of the month and, after another visit to Holy Loch during the first week in March, headed back to the United States. On 17 March, she returned to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard to begin preparations for decommissioning incident to her transfer to the Military Sealift Command. Thor was decommissioned at Portsmouth on 2 July 1973 and simultaneously transferred to the custody of the Military Sealift Command. USNS Thor (T-ARC-4) operated with the Military Sealift Command, primarily in the Pacific, until April 1974. Disposal Thor was returned to the Maritime Administration to be placed in reserve. Berthed with the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California 31 July 1975. The ship was withdrawn 2 May 1977 for removal of cable machinery and returned to the reserve fleet on 1 June 1977. The ship was sold to National Metal & Steel Corporation for scrapping on 22 September 1977 as one of four ships sold for a total of $565,183.92.

It was announced by Steve Jobs during the opening keynote at the Worldwide Developers Conference on August 7, 2006. As of Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, it has been incorporated into Mission Control. Overview Spaces enables users to create multiple virtual desktops suited to the unique needs or work habits of the user. A user could, for example, create and assign a \\"space\\" to office work, enabling him or her to leave a work-related application (such as a word processor or a spreadsheet) running full screen and then switch to a different space designated for browsing the Internet or navigating file structure in Finder windows. Up to 16 spaces can be created, and applications can be bound to specific spaces. There are various ways to navigate between spaces, including user-configured, function-key combinations, hot corners (via Expos√©), or by dragging windows and applications ‚Äî in the direction of the desired space ‚Äî to the corresponding edge of the screen and holding for a moment until the space switches. The Dashboard functions as a separate space, on the left of the other spaces by default. Use In Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard System Preferences, a checkbox labeled \\"Enable Spaces\\" must first be checked in the \\"Expos√© & Spaces\\" preferences, under the \\"Spaces\\" tab. Then, as many as 16 spaces can be created by adding rows or columns. Application assignments may be added and bound to specific spaces listed, by their corresponding numbers, in the right-hand column. When an assigned application is launched, it will open on the designated space and remain in that location unless it is moved manually to another space. There are a few settings for activating and switching between spaces. A checkbox at the bottom of the panel allows switching spaces automatically when switching between applications bound to spaces. This is achieved either by clicking on application icons in the dock, or by pressing ‚åò (Command) + Tab, and Spaces will jump directly to the space that the chosen application has been assigned to. A limitation of Spaces lies in the fact that some applications featuring tool palettes and/or multiple open document windows (such as Adobe Creative Suite or Microsoft Office applications) cannot be consistently bound to a specific (numbered) space. In such cases, the \\"switching\\" function responds to the most recently active document, regardless of which space it has been opened upon, so it is usually more efficient to avoid assigning such applications to a specific space and to run them unassigned, opening documents in the desired space. Function-key combinations can also be configured to activate the full-screen Spaces grid view, switch between spaces directionally, or switch directly to a specific space by number. A function allows applications or windows to be moved into (or through) adjacent spaces by dragging and holding the window (or document) at the edge of the screen. During a transition to a new space, a small, translucent image representing the Spaces grid configuration will be shown in the center of the screen for a few seconds, with arrows representing the movement, and the active space highlighted. When viewing the full-screen grid, spaces themselves may be re-arranged by dragging and dropping (requires clicking on the blue \\"desktop\\" area, instead of on a window within it). This does not change the application assignments, but is equivalent to manually moving a window or document to a new space. The application will retain its assignment and when launched at a later date, will run on the originally assigned space. Spaces also works effectively with Expos√©, another Mac OS X feature, where you can designate a \\"hot corner\\" to activate the full-screen feature of Spaces, showing a \\"zoomed-out\\" grid of scaled-down thumbnails for each space. Also, when the Spaces grid has been activated, Expos√© may be additionally deployed to reveal the active windows or documents on each space. Comparison Although Spaces was a new feature for Mac OS 10.5, virtual desktops existed for quite some time on other platforms, such as Linux, Solaris, AIX and BeOS. Virtual desktops also existed for WindowsMultiple Desktop Support in Windows and for the Mac OS via third party software., and it has been a standard feature on Linux desktops for a number of years.redhat.com: Red Hat Linux 6.1 Getting Started Guide, 1999.

She is known as \\"the Queen of Persian music\\". Singing with the vocal range of a mezzo-soprano, she was revered for her mastery of the repertoire of Persian vocal music (radif-e √¢v√¢z), especially her sensitive rendition of tasnif and tar√¢na. Early life and career Qamar was born in Takestan, a city in Iran. Her father died before she was born, and after her mother's death from typhoid fever when she was one and a half years old, she was raised by her grandmother, rowzeh-kh√¢n (singer of soaz) at the darbar of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, Moll√¢ Khayr-ol-Nes√¢' Eftekh√¢r-ol-Z√¢kerin (the latter name was bestowed on her by the king, meaning \\"Glory of the Narrators\\"). Qamar later recalled attending her grandmother's singing at the mosque, among the experiences which inspired her to become a singer. She began her career in singing at age 19 in 1924 when she performed at the Grand Hotel in Tehran. When she performed she was among men and without the veil. During another performance at the Palace Theater in Tehran, again without the veil, she was accompanied by Morteza Neidavoud, who she had met when she was 16, just a few years earlier. He encouraged her to study music under his tutelage and she studied and performed in 1924. Vaziri and Neydavood worked a lot together during her 3 decade long career and in 1956 accompanied her for her farewell performance. Her existing birth certificate, issued in Tehran in 1925, legally records her first name as \\"Qamar-ol-Moluk\\" and her last name as changed from \\"Seyed Hosayn Kh√¢n\\" to \\"Vaziriz√¢deh\\", a name she chose for herself in honor of the musician and theoretician of music Ali-Naqi Vaziri. right Vaziri retired from singing in 1956, having worked for over 30 years with songwriters and poets in Iran, such as Morteza Neydavud, and having been recorded on several gramophone discs. She had often sung for charity and for the poor in Iran as well. She devoted her last years to philanthropic activities, as Zobeideh Jahangiri recalls them in A Moon Which Became The Sun ( / Qamar-i Keh Xor≈°id ≈†od). Vaziri died in 1959 in Shemiran. She is buried at Zahir o-dowleh cemetery. Contrary to popular belief that she died poor, she received a monthly salary of 800 tomans during the years preceding her death, which was about the salary of a high ranking university teacher.

The area is roughly bounded by Vincent Road, Torquay Drive and High Street to the north, Roman Road and Stoneygate Road to the south, the M1 to the west, and Marsh Road and Leagrave Park to the east. Due to its 35-minute connection by train from Leagrave station into London it is home to significant numbers of commuters, with almost two million using the train station each year. Leagrave station also has connections to Bedford in the north and Brighton in the south by Thameslink. Junctions 11 and 11a of the M1 are close at hand as well as Luton Airport. Etymology The village of Leagrave was recorded in 1224 as Littegraue, intimating that its name means 'Light-coloured, or lightly wooded, grove'. However, another source suggests its name originates from Lygegrove: \\"Lyge\\" being an old name for the River Lea. A place spelt as Lythtegrave (which may refer to Leagrave, since the prior of Dunstaple also features, and the county margination is Bedfordshire) appears in 1396.Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; National Archives; CP 40 / 0541; Year 1396; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT6/R2/CP40no541a/aCP40no541afronts/IMG_0007.htm; third entry History The first settlement in the area was Waulud's Bank which is a Neolithic D-shaped enclosure in Leagrave Park at the source of the River Lea and is now a protected monument. Waulud's bank consists of a bank and external ditch of around 7 hectares with a turf revetted chalk and gravel bank (built from the excavated ditch material). The ditch itself is about 9 m wide and 2 m deep. Finds at the site have included neolithic Grooved Ware and flint arrow heads. It is a similar site to Durrington Walls and Marden and the site was later re-used in the Iron Age and during the Roman occupation. The Icknield Way, a pre Roman road, passes through Leagrave. Local road names give away its location, 'Roman Road' runs from Oakley Road to Marsh Road. On the other side of Marsh Road as the road enters Limbury it continues as 'Icknield Road' where there is a gap before the road continues as Icknield Way. station building on Platform 4 at Leagrave Map showing the extent of Leagrave Village in 1889 The River Lea which flows through the area once formed one boundary of the Danelaw. Leagrave Marsh used to be a popular place for the Luton hatters on their (rare) days off and was, consequently, known as \\"Blockers' Seaside\\". The hatmaking industry originally relied on straw plaits, made by farmers' wives, bought and collected by a \\"plaitman\\" and brought into the Luton hat factories to be made into straw hats. A new artwork has been unveiled in the area, reflecting on this former activity.Opening of artwork at the Blockers Seaside The manor of Leagrave was held by the Lucy family from 1305 to 1455. The Lucys gave their name to the neighbouring suburbs of Lewsey, Lewsey Farm, and Lewsey Park. Leagrave station was built by the Midland Railway company in 1868 on its extension to St Pancras. The original Midland station buildings still exist, having been carefully restored in the 1980s. In 1866 the villages of Leagrave and Limbury were formed into the ecclesiastical parish of 'Holy Trinity, (Biscot)'. Thirty years later, in 1896 Leagrave civil parish was formed under the provisions of the 'Local Government Act 1894', in the ecclesiastical parish of Limbury-cum-Biscot. In 1914 Hewlett & Blondeau Limited, an aircraft manufacturing business, opened a factory at Leagrave called The Omnia Works.History of Hewlett & Blondeau The company was managed by Hilda Hewlett who lived on site. During the First World War the factory produced more than 800 aircraft and employed up to 700 people. The business closed in 1920 and in 1926 the factory site was sold to Electrolux. The area grew significantly in between the wars and in 1928 the parish was abolished when the boundaries of Luton were extended to include Leagrave, as well as Limbury and Stopsley. Further expansion of the area took place during the 1930s. Much of the housing stock of the area dates from the 1920s and 1930s and is typical of the era, with large bay-fronted semi-detached and terraced houses the typical housing built at this time. Some of the old farm names live on in the modern road names, Strangers Farm lends its name to the current Strangers Way, and Grange Avenue (Grange Road until the 1920s) takes its name from The Grange Farm. Until the 1990s Electrolux was one of the larger employers in the area; however, much of the old factory site was sold off in the early 2000s for redevelopment into housing. The most recent development on the site was Saxon-Gate. The current site of the McDonald's restaurant on Marsh Road was the site of the Three Horseshoes pub, which was demolished in 1994.Details about demolition of the Three Horseshoes Pub The roundabout next to McDonald's takes its name from the old pub, with the old pub sign incorporated in the planting scheme. The Sugar Loaf pub was also located on the high street, but this has since been converted into a restaurant and then more recently renovated into flats. Following Leagrave village becoming part of the larger town of Luton in 1928, many local roads were renamed to avoid confusion with existing Luton road names. For example, Oak Road became Oakley Road, Cumberland Avenue became Compton Avenue and Salisbury Road became Sarum Road (Sarum being the Roman name for Salisbury). Local Area There is a parade of shops on High Street/Grange Avenue at the centre of Leagrave, as well as a busy commercial area on the border with Limbury on Marsh Road. Electrolux has moved its UK headquarters back to the area, based in one of the old Omnia Works buildings on Oakley Road. Leagrave is increasingly a commuter area with many people taking advantage of the 35-minute train journey time into London as well as motorway connections to London and to the North. This has led to many new developments of infill housing and apartment buildings. River Lea as it passes through Leagrave Park Much of the land around the old Marsh Farmhouse (which gives its name to neighbouring Marsh Farm), as well as Leagrave Common is now part of Leagrave Park. The park provides contains a number of different areas including sports pitches, native woodland habitat, wildlife areas, river and wetland areas and links to the historic environment. It comprises a playing field of 59.34 acres with pavilion, play area, bowling green and car parking. The park also includes areas of County Wildlife designation, Leagrave Common and the Scheduled Monument, Waulud's Bank a 4500-year-old Neolithic enclosure.http://www.fieldsintrust.org/Leagrave-Park- Playing-Fields River Lee in Leagrave MarshOnly a few hundred metres from its source and the River Lee is already over 10 metres wide here.

Churches St Lukes Church, Leagrave The largest church in the parish is St Lukes on Leagrave High Street, which was consecrated by the Bishop of Saint Albans in June 1956. It is a grade II listed buildinghttp://www.lutonheritageforum.org/site_record_0048.htmlhttp://www.luton.gov.uk/Environment/Land_and_premises/Buildings/Pages/Statutory%20register%20listed%20buildings.aspx due largely to its frontage,http://www.eplan.luton.gov.uk/plannet/documentstore/DC19512563-32-1_AF_A.PDF and was designed by John Seely and Paul Paget.

County Route 520 is a major road across Monmouth County connecting the county's central towns to the Jersey Shore at Sea Bright. The highway extends from Englishtown Road (CR 527) in Old Bridge Township to Ocean Avenue (Route 36, formerly County Route 9) in Sea Bright. CR 520 extends east along Texas Road to the intersection with Marlboro Road, then turns southeast onto Marlboro Road. Texas Road continues beyond Marlboro Road as CR 690. CR 520 is under municipal (Old Bridge and Marlboro Townships) jurisdiction between Texas Road and U.S. Route 9 (US 9). From US 9 to its eastern terminus it is under Monmouth County jurisdiction. CR 520 is known by several names between US 9 and Route 35, among them Main Street, Newman Springs Road and simply Route 520, but for the greater part of its distance it is Newman Springs Road. At Route 35, CR 520 turns briefly north on Broad Street in Red Bank, then turns east again onto Pinckney Road, which it follows into Little Silver. It continues through Little Silver along Branch Avenue before turning onto Rumson Road, which it then follows through Rumson to its terminus at Ocean Avenue (Route 36) in Sea Bright. Route description View east along CR 520 at CR 527 in Old Bridge CR 520 begins at an intersection with CR 527 in Old Bridge Township, Middlesex County, heading east on two-lane undivided Texas Road. The route heads through dense forests before it comes to a junction with CR 690. At this point, CR 690 continues east along Texas Road and CR 520 heads southeast on Marlboro Road. The road passes near a housing development and crosses into Marlboro Township in Monmouth County, where it widens to four lanes as it crosses US 9 in an area of businesses. Past this intersection, the route narrows back to two lanes and passes through wooded residential areas before it crosses CR 3 and comes to a partial interchange with the Route 18 freeway; missing movements are provided by CR 3. Following this, CR 520 continues past more housing developments and curves to the east, becoming Newman Springs Road. The road crosses Route 79 and runs through a mix of fields and woods with some homes, heading to the east-northeast. The route becomes the border between Marlboro Township to the north and Colts Neck Township to the south as it heads more to the east. CR 520 eastbound in Holmdel Township CR 520 crosses Willow Brook into Holmdel Township shortly before it reaches an intersection with Route 34. After this junction, the road passes between a corporate park to the north and fields to the south before it crosses CR 4 and runs past residential neighborhoods. The route passes to the north of Thompson County Park and enters Middletown Township at the CR 52 intersection. CR 520 curves southeast and heads east to a roundabout at the entrance road to Brookdale Community College. Farther east, the route intersects CR 50 in a commercial area, at which point it widens to four lanes. The road heads past homes and crosses under Normandy Road and a railroad line which link the two sections of Naval Weapons Station Earle, where it briefly becomes a divided highway. A short distance later, CR 520 comes to an interchange with the Garden State Parkway. At this interchange, park and ride lots are located at the northwest and northeast corners, with the lot on the northeast corner called the Lincroft Transportation Center Park & Ride and serving Academy Bus Lines. Following this, the route becomes a divided highway again and runs past a few businesses before it crosses the Swimming River and becomes the border between Red Bank to the north and Tinton Falls to the south. The road becomes undivided again as it passes homes. Upon crossing CR 13, CR 520 narrows to two lanes and passes businesses as it separates Red Bank to the north and Shrewsbury to the south. The road crosses Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Southern Secondary line and continues east to an intersection with Route 35. The drawbridge that carries CR 520 over the Shrewsbury River from Rumson to Sea Bright At this point, CR 520 turns north for a brief concurrency with Route 35, crossing NJ Transit's North Jersey Coast Line. Immediately after the railroad tracks, Route 35 splits to the northwest and CR 520 continues north on two-lane Broad Street for one block before it turns east onto Pinckney Road, with CR 11 continuing north on Broad Street. CR 520 runs through wooded residential areas and leaves Red Bank for Little Silver. At an intersection with another segment of CR 11, the route turns southeast onto Branch Avenue. CR 520 turns northeast onto Rumson Road and CR 11 continues along Branch Avenue. The road passes more homes and continues into Rumson. CR 520 continues northeast and passes to the north of Rumson Country Club. Farther east, the route curves to the east and crosses the Shrewsbury River on a drawbridge into Sea Bright.

It featured works by 250 sculptors from around the world, and ran from May 15 to September 11, 1949. The exhibition was organized by the Fairmount Park Art Association (now the Association for Public Art) under the terms of a bequest made to the Association by the late Ellen Phillips Samuel. Ellen Phillips Samuel was a member of the Fairmount Park Art Association and a supporter of many cultural activities in Philadelphia. When she died in 1913, she left the bulk of her estate in trust to the Art Association, specifying that the income be used to create a series of sculptural monuments ‚Äúemblematic of the history of America.‚Äù When these funds became available upon the death of her husband in 1929, the Art Association appointed a planning committee, which decided that the Samuel Memorial should express major ideas and spiritual forces as well as chronological developments in American history. To identify sculptors, the committee organized three international exhibitions at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. These Sculpture Internationals, in 1933, 1940, and 1949, brought together the works of hundreds of sculptors from the United States and abroad. The exhibitions contributed not only to the Samuel Memorial but also to the general awareness of contemporary sculpture throughout the Philadelphia area.

It is located 76 West Adams at the northeast corner of Adams Avenue West and Park Avenue, across from Grand Circus Park, in the Foxtown neighborhood, just north of Downtown. The building was designed by Albert Kahn and constructed in 1914, and stands at 18 floors, with one basement floor, for a total of 19 floors in height. It was originally named the Kresge Building and it was given its current name in 1930. Kahn went beyond the typical Chicago School and styled the Kales Building with a clean-lined detail fa√ßade with Neo-classical and Renaissance revival elements such as the hipped roof and arched upper windows. History When completed in 1914, the Kales Building housed the headquarters of the S.S. Kresge Company, forerunner of retailing giant Kmart.Profile of S. S. Kresge World Headquarters Building.Detroit1701.org. Retrieved on November 24, 2007. Kresge only occupied 9 of the 18 floors. The rest of the floors was leased out to doctors and dentists and the storefronts included a pharmacy. S.S. Kresge Co. moved out of the building in 1930 for a new headquarters at Cass Park and the old headquarters remained a prime location for medical offices. The last tenant, New York Custom Shoe Shop owned by Antonio Bava, moved out of the building in 1986 and it sat vacant until its restoration in 2004. Redevelopment In the 1990s, plans were brought up for the future Ford Field and Comerica Park on the west side of Woodward. Demolition of the Kales Building was considered to make space for parking. The building's future was put in limbo when the proposed stadiums were shifted to the opposite side of Woodward. Then the city requested the Greater Downtown Partnership to try to sell the property to developers. During the summer of 1999 the GDP held 'request for proposals' for the Kales and the nearby Statler Hotel to attract bids from developers planning to redevelop the building into loft apartments. The renovation was announced thereafter and initial cleanup work began in 2000. The Kales Building was renovated in 2003-2004 into 117 residential units with ground- level retail.

It was designated as such in 1965. Location  The area overlooks the valley of the River Avon, northwest of Salisbury. It lies east of the A360 road, which runs from Salisbury to Devizes via Stonehenge. Environment The down has a chalk grassland that has been well grazed and contains numerous plants, which is typical of grass sites in South Wilshire. Over 20 types of grasses and sedges have been recorded at Camp Down, including red fescue, upright brome, quaking- grass, crested hair-grass and glaucous sedge. The turf contains a variety of herbs, including dwarf thistle and ox-eye daisy. There are a significant number of orchids, particularly Gymnadenia conopsea. There are a number of young sycamore trees on the site, alongside patches of scrub and scattered bushes. The environment of chalk grassland mixed with scattered scrub means Camp Down is frequented to a number of types of birds and insects. Historical records show there were several types of plant bug and beetle fauna on the site. Camp Down has seen problems with badgers who are a prominent carrier of tuberculosis. In 2019, Nautral England reported that the government would grant a licence for badger culling on the site in the interests of preserving the environment. The action has been controversial, and criticised by the Badger Trust as unnecessarily cruel.

From this point, CR 519 becomes Bridgeville-Hope Road and passes through more farm areas immediately to the west of Jenny Jump State Forest, turning more to the northeast and entering Hope Township. The road passes a mix of woods and farms as it curves north and enters the residential community of Hope. Here, CR 519 becomes Union Street and makes a turn east onto High Street, with CR 521 continuing north at this point. CR 519 continues northeast out of Hope along Hope-Johnsonburg Road, passing through a mix of farmland and woodland with occasional homes. The road crosses under I-80 before coming into Frelinghuysen Township and becoming Johnsonburg Road. In this area, the surroundings become more wooded with a few fields. The road passes near a few wooded residential areas before coming to the CR 661 junction, at which point CR 519 turns northeast onto Johnsonburg-Newton Road. The route heads through more rural areas and crosses under the abandoned Lackawanna Cutoff. CR 519 crosses into Green Township, Sussex County and becomes Hibler Road. A short distance past the county line, the route turns north onto Wintermute Road, which makes a turn northeast into a narrow agricultural valley. Upon intersecting CR 608, CR 519 enters Fredon Township and the name changes to Ridge Road. The road continues into a mix of woodland and residential areas, with some farm fields, before entering Newton. At this point, the route becomes West End Avenue and passes several homes. CR 519 comes to an intersection with Route 94, and turns east to follow that route along High Street. Route 94 and CR 519 continue to downtown Newton and come to the Park Place square, where the road meets US 206. At this point, all three routes run concurrent north on four-lane undivided Water Street for a short distance. CR 519 splits from US 206/Route 94 by turning northwest onto four-lane undivided Mill Street.

CR 519 continues to an intersection with Route 23, where it turns north for a concurrency with that route. The two routes pass through forested areas with some homes until CR 519 splits from Route 23 by heading north on Greenville Road. This road carries the route north, entering dense forests and crossing the Appalachian Trail before it comes to the New York border. At the state line, CR 519 ends and the road continues into Orange County, New York as CR 55. History From Mill Street, starting about 250 feet northwest of its current intersection (following realignment in the 1970s from Spring Street) with Water Street at Trinity Street in Newton, to the currently-named Morris Turnpike in Hampton Township, CR 519 follows the route of the former Morris (and Sussex) Turnpike.

The Misty Flip was first done by Jason King out of the Sugarbush half pipe circa 1991. The trick was later named by professional snowboarder Ali Goulet, an original member of the Vermont Snowboard Posse that included Jeff Brushie, Chris Swierz, and Josh Brownley. Unlike in acrobatic disciplines where athletes remain in the same plane in space during the trick, the backside 540 rotation and off axis spin are combined. Not unlike a McTwist but off a straight jump rather than a transition. Misty Flips can be performed in many variations with bigger spins, grabs and even double Misty. In order to perform a Misty Flip, a person must throw his shoulder down to his left or right side, commencing a spin while his head and body invert to an up-side down position. The person lands backwards or frontwards, depending on the rotation amount. In snowboarding, when performed on a straight jump, the motion initiates a rotation that mimics that of a McTwist, which is generally performed in halfpipes and on quarterpipes. However, because the Misty Flip is performed on a straight jump, it is further distinguished from a McTwist because the rider lands backwards following the 540 rotation. The Misty Flip was published in Blunt Magazine Volume 3.1 circa 1994, performed by Ali Goulet, photographed by Rob Mcconaughy of Kingpin Productions who also put the trick in his movie ‚ÄúCaffeine‚Äù Similar tricks *Bio spin *McTwist References Skateboarding tricks Snowboarding tricks ","title":"Misty Flip"},{"id":"6336862","text":"The European Astronaut Centre (EAC) (German: Europ√§isches Astronautenzentrum, French: Centre des astronautes europ√©ens), is an establishment of the European Space Agency and home of the European Astronaut Corps.

He writes about theory, practice, and pedagogy, and has authored several books and papers. He is one of the pioneers of freewriting. Biography In the introduction to the second edition of Writing Without Teachers, Elbow says that his interest in writing practices came from his own difficulty with writing. He attended Proctor Academy and Williams College from 1953 to 1957. While at Exeter College, Oxford University, on scholarship from Williams, he found himself unable to write the assigned essays. When he began his PhD in English at Harvard University, his writing difficulties persisted, causing him to leave in the first year of his studies. Elbow began teaching, first as an instructor at MIT from 1960‚Äì1963, and then as one of five founding members of Franconia College from 1963‚Äì1965. It was at Franconia where Elbow discovered he could write more easily when writing for colleagues or students rather than as an assigned piece.Elbow Writing Without Teachers xivElbow Selected In 1965 he returned to graduate school, this time at Brandeis University. He had to get over beginning by trying to write \\"well\\" -- that is to write good sentences and work from an outline. He had to learn to write what he liked to call \\"garbage.\\" He came to accept that he simply couldn't write right; he could only write wrong; and then try by revising to make it right. Elbow has said that the process of freewriting really came about during this time in his life. He would sit down with his typewriter and type out all his thoughts, making writing a sort of therapy. This helped him to write his graduate papers. When it came time to write a dissertation, he spent a year trying to write about metaphor -- not metaphor as linguistic decoration but metaphor as thinking. He realized that this would make the process interminable. He settled on Chaucer. He would eventually make his dissertation book-length and publish it in 1975 under the title Oppositions in Chaucer.Elbow Writing Without Teachers xv-xvi After receiving his PhD, Elbow accepted a position at MIT in 1968, turning down an offer from Berkeley to remain in the Boston area for personal reasons. While sitting in his office one day in 1970, a representative from Oxford University Press came to show him some books that he might like to use in his classes. When the representative asked Elbow if he was writing anything, Elbow replied that he had thought about trying to write something to do with teacher-less writing groups--a process he had experimented with while teaching courses for Harvard's extension program. Soon after, he had an advance to begin a book called Writing Without Tears, which would later become Writing Without Teachers.Elbow Writing Without Teachers xvi-xvii In the nearly 40 years since then, Elbow has written more than 10 books, and 100 articles on writing-- theory and practice--and the teaching of writing. His most recent book is an ambitious treatment of writing, speaking, and the theory of written and spoken language: Vernavcular Eloquence: What Can Speech Bring to Writing. Methods=Freewriting Freewriting, a term commonly used by Elbow, coined by Ken Macrorie (who called it free writing), is a process of writing without stopping, without editing, without sharing, without worrying about grammar, without thinking, without rushing. Elbow suggests that writers write whatever they want and however they want for 10 to 15 minutes--daily. Normal freewriting can be adapted to focused freewriting and public freewriting. Focused freewriting involves trying to stay on a topic, which is particularly useful when a writer has a specific assignment to do. Public freewriting is for sharing, which makes it seem a little more risky. But it can be very useful in groups where good trust has built up. The goal is to create language that is more natural and lively, all the while making the writing process easier and more comfortable Elbow, Peter. \\"Re: Hunter Students Adjusting Your Wikipedia Page.\\" Message to the author. Jan. 14, 2011. E-mail. Criterion- and reader-based feedback Feedback techniques are also among Elbow's practices. These techniques, presented in Writing With Power, are divided into two types: criterion-based and reader-based feedback. Criterion-based feedback judges the writing against standard criteria, such as content, usage, organization, and general effectiveness. Elbow claims this is the kind of feedback that most people are used to giving and receiving. What Elbow says is quite useful about criterion-based feedback is that it allows the writer to reflect on her or his own writing as he goes along. It also allows her or him to recognize common troubles he has in writing so that he can avoid them in the future. In Writing With Power, Elbow gives a catalogue of criterion-based questions. These questions all stem from the following essential questions: ::::*What is the quality of the content of the writing: the ideas, the perceptions, the point of view? ::::*How well is the writing organized? ::::*How effective is the language? ::::*Are there mistakes or inappropriate choices of usage?.Elbow Writing With Power 240. While criterion-based feedback may seem obvious, it is the inclusion of reader-based feedback that makes this overall method fresh for teachers. Elbow claims that reader-based feedback lets the writer see what thoughts and feelings occur in a reader's mind as he or she is reading the text. Elbow calls this type of feedback \\"movies of the reader's mind.\\" The list of detailed questions Elbow provides for reader-based feedback follow from the following essential questions: ::::*What was happening to you, moment by moment, as you were reading the piece of writing? ::::*Summarize the writing: give your understanding of what it says or what happened in it. ::::*Make up some images for the writing and the transaction it creates with you. Works While Peter Elbow is the author of over 10 books, as well as numerous articles which largely deal with writing theory and practice, few of his works have been as critical to his career as Writing Without Teachers (Oxford UP 1973) and Writing With Power: Techniques for Mastering the Writing Process (Oxford UP 1981). Writing Without Teachers 1973 Writing Without Teachers was Elbow's first book about writing, and the one that has made his freewriting technique so popular as a pedagogical practice. In this book, Elbow uses two main metaphors. These are metaphors that reflect Elbow's interest in letting one's ideas develop and change throughout the writing process. The first is to see writing as growing. It must move through stages. The first stage is to generate words before a writer can continue to \\"grow\\" a piece of writing and move through the subsequent stages. In this section Elbow stresses that it is crucial to write as much as possible because the more a writer writes, not only does he have more to work with, but he also has more to throw away, allowing him to keep moving through the growing stages of writing. The second metaphor is to see writing as cooking, letting ideas simmer and bubble until they are ready to be used. In this metaphor, Elbow emphasizes interaction, particularly between writing and reiteration. According to Elbow, growing is transformation at the macro level, cooking is transformation at the micro level. Essentially, the writing lets his ideas simmer until he can use them to interact with his writing. Elbow suggests that writers spend sufficient time writing as well as stopping completely and reflecting on what the larger picture is meant to present.Elbow, Peter. Writing Without Teachers. 2nd ed. New York: Oxford UP, 1973, 1998. Also notable in Writing Without Teachers is Elbow's proposition of the teacher-less writing class, which is the root of today's writing groups. In these teacher-less writing classes, which meet at least once a week, all group members actively participate by contributing a piece of writing and reading each other's work. They discuss it with the goal of getting the writer to see not necessarily what is wrong or right with the piece, but instead what effect the writing has on the readers in the group, as opposed to one teacher's opinion. This is also very similar to Writing Workshops, which are also currently popular pedagogical practices. \\"The Believing Game\\" \\"The Believing Game\\" is an appendix essay, where Elbow acknowledges the game of believing as a method that he applies to all his work. The essay defines the believing game in comparison to the doubting game ‚Äì which is also more familiarly known as critical thinking. Elbow feels doubting and believing are two methods needed in order to examine and accept an idea as true. The appendix to Writing Without Teachers has a section called \\"The Doubting and Believing Game: An Analysis of the Intellectual Enterprise\\". Elbow started out simply trying to justify his \\"no arguing\\" rule for teacher-less classes, but it developed into what really is the central theoretical foundation underlying all of his work. Elbow argues that Western conceptions of good thinking are based on the doubting game or critical thinking: A process that seeks to use a methodology of skeptical doubting to find flaws in thinking that might look good. Elbow argues that really good thinking also calls on a complementary methodology: conditionally trying to believe all ideas in order to find virtues in thinking that looks wrong. (He is NOT arguing against the doubting game or critical thinking; just asking for an additional methodology.) Elbow has developed the believing game in a series of essays written throughout his career: \\"Methodological Doubting and Believing: Contraries in Enquiry\\", in Embracing Contraries, (Oxford University Press, 1986: 253‚Äì300); \\"Bringing the Rhetoric of Assent and The Believing Game Together‚Äîand into the Classroom\\", College English 67.4 (March 2005): 388‚Äì99; \\"The Believing Game and How to Make Conflicting Opinions More Fruitful\\", in Nurturing the Peacemakers in Our Students: A Guide to Teaching Peace, Empathy, and Understanding. Chris Weber, editor. Heinemann, 2006, 16‚Äì25; \\"The Believing Game or Methodological Believing\\", Journal for The Assembly for Expanded Perspectives on Learning 14 Winter 2009: 1‚Äì11. His essay \\"The Uses of Binary Thinking\\" is also crucial in this theoretical work. Writing With Power Writing With Power was published in 1981 during an era where writing teachers were starting to try to get a sense of what it meant to be a writer teaching writing. During this time, current-traditionalism was quite popular in handbooks for writers (Strunk & White's Elements of Style, for example). This method presented writers with a very cut and dried sense of how to write. With the publication of Writing With Power, Peter Elbow broke the current-traditionalist mold. This book proffers various techniques for writers to try, finding one that best suits them. This book takes writers through the whole writing process from generating ideas (where freewriting once more makes an appearance) to revising and editing both alone and with others. Elbow goes on to address issues when writing to different kinds of audiences and also how to seek adequate feedback. It seems to be Elbow's goal to show writers that there is more than just one \\"correct\\" way to involve oneself in the writing process. If writers learn to interact with their writing in these ways, they have learned to write with power.Elbow, Peter. Writing With Power: Techniques for Mastering the Writing Process. New York: Oxford UP, 1981, 1998. The Elbow and Bartholomae debate In the 1990s, Peter Elbow engaged in a public debate with David Bartholomae regarding the role of the writer, as well as that of an academic in undergraduate writing.Elbow \\"Being\\" 72) Bartholomae posits that Elbow \\"comes down on the side of credulity as the governing idea in the undergraduate writing course,\\" whereas he, himself, expresses more skepticism.Bartholomae and Elbow 84 The debate continued with these differing views: Elbow believes that writing belongs to the writer from the beginning; Bartholomae counters that he is more dismissive, not necessarily granting the writer her own presence. He believes that Elbow is too accepting while he, himself, thinks that the writer should prove himself first. In his response, Elbow agrees with Bartholomae that training for academic writing should be a crucial part of an undergraduate's career; however, Elbow says that this training can't be completed in just one semester. Elbow says that perhaps one of their greatest differences is that Bartholomae believes the classroom to be a \\"'real space, not an idealized utopian space'\\" (88). This implies to Elbow that Bartholomae believes that \\"a classroom cannot be utopian, and that utopian spaces are not real spaces\\" (88). Another major aspect of the debate comes from the idea of writing without teachers, a concept that Bartholomae states doesn't exist. Elbow cites diaries, letters, stories, poems, and so forth as ways that students write for themselves with no teachers involved. Elbow acknowledges that unequal power, however, is ubiquitous, and not just in writing, but believes that there is still plenty of writing being done for the students' own enjoyment. The debate has, over the years, helped to shape the understanding and teaching of composition theory, especially in regard to how much power is granted the writer. It has also caused writers to consider audience in ways they may not have before. In the end, the two have essentially agreed to disagree, with Bartholomae saying that the writer should have the role of authorship to work towards, and Elbow maintaining that writers be accepted as writers from the beginning.

After arriving in Baltimore, Farr moved to Bayonne in 1862. On May 31, 1863, he married Mary Dorethea Schmidt; they had five children together. After a time operating a canal boat, Farr became successful in business running a contracting firm in Bayonne. A Republican, he was nominated by both the Democratic Party and the Independent Party and was elected mayor of Bayonne, defeating incumbent Republican mayor John Newman in a highly contested election in 1891. Farr, who received the nomination of both the Democrats and the Republicans in 1893, easily won a second term. In Farr's two terms as mayor, he was instrumental in bringing water and electricity to Bayonne. Nominated for a third term in 1895, he lost to the Democrat Egbert Seymour in 1895. Farr retired from business a wealthy man. He donated money to a number of charities including the German Lutheran Hospital in Manhattan, New York City. Farr died on February 14, 1921 in his home at age 77 of influenza. He is buried in Moravian Cemetery on Staten Island.

As an amateur he won the bantamweight gold medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics, and was a world champion at the 1991 World Amateur Boxing Championships in flyweight and at the 1997 World Amateur Boxing Championships in featherweight. As a professional he was a world champion, holding the WBO featherweight belt in 2001. Amateur career Kov√°cs was born in Budapest and began his sports career as a football player, training among others in the youth team of MTK Budapest. He started boxing relatively late at the age of 15 in EVIG SE. He moved to Vasas SC in 1988 where he was trained by Gyula B√≥dis. His first international success also came in 1988 when he won the junior-flyweight gold medal at the Junior European Championship in Gda≈Ñsk. He soon started to dominate the lower weightclasses on the Hungarian scene among such rivals like Olympic bronze medallists J√°nos V√°radi and R√≥bert Isaszegi, and in 1990 he was already a member of the Hungarian team at the World Cup in Dublin where he won a silver medal. In 1991, already as a flyweight, he won the gold medal at the European Championships in Gothenburg and later that year he also won the World Championship in Sydney. Due to his outstanding achievements he was elected as Hungarian Sportsman of The Year the end of the year, ahead of competitors like legendary medley swimmer Tam√°s Darnyi who was elected as that year's World Swimmer of the Year and wrestling world champion P√©ter Farkas. Kov√°cs's spectacular boxing style and nice personality soon made him a crowd and media favourite, and he was widely considered as one of Hungary's top gold medal chances at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. He easily outpointed his first three opponents, but in the semi-finals he was surprisingly upset by Choi Chol-Su from North Korea. Choi, who defeated other future professional world champions Paul Ingle and Robbie Peden in his two previous bouts, went on to win the gold medal and Kov√°cs had to settle for the bronze which was considered by many as a disappointment at that time. After the Olympics Kov√°cs's career seemed to decline. He broke up with his long-time trainer and continued with Imre Sz√°nt√≥ and moved up to bantamweight, but his results did not achieve the same level as before, his best result being a bronze medal at the 1993 European Championships in Bursa and at the 1995 World Cup in Bangkok. The media also reported about party nights and personal problems, and many thought that he will never find his former self. But in 1996 Kov√°cs came roaring back, once again winning the European Championships in Vejle, and then in the summer he finally gained the long-awaited Olympic gold medal in Atlanta outpointing Arnaldo Mesa from Cuba in the final. At the end of the year he was elected as Sportsman of The Year in Hungary for the second time. After the Olympics he was signed by the Hamburg-based professional stable Universum Box- Promotion together with the now-famous Klitschko brothers Vitali and Wladimir, to join world champions Dariusz Michalczewski, Artur Grigorian and Regina Halmich, but he opted to stay among the amateurs for one more year because Budapest was to host the 1997 World Championships, where in front of several thousand home supporters, he managed to conclude his amateur career by winning his second gold medal, this time in featherweight. He finished his amateur career with an outstanding record of 282 wins, 14 losses and one draw. Professional career Kov√°cs began his professional career coached by former top class amateur East German trainer Fritz Sdunek in late 1997, amidst great media hype in Hungary, with one of the newly founded nationwide TV channels buying the exclusive rights to broadcast his bouts. In his first fight he knocked out Frenchman Ahmed Lain in the first round and racked up a 10-0 record within little more than one year. In his ninth bout he defeated former EBU champion Vincenzo Belcastro and in 1999 he gained the WBC featherweight intercontinental belt by defeating Nabaloum Dramane in Budapest. Due to his technical skills, fast foot- and handspeed and spectacular fighting style he was often compared to fellow 1996 Olympian Floyd Mayweather Jr. who started his long-lasting reign in the super-featherweight division at that time, and he was considered as the future challenger of the unbeaten WBO featherweight champion Naseem Hamed. Kov√°cs was to make his debut in the United States in late 1999 in Las Vegas, but in the last days before the bout his nose was broken while sparring with Bones Adams who grabbed the WBA super-bantamweight title a few months later. Many consider this as a crucial point in Kov√°cs's professional career as he ultimately never fought in the United States. Instead his management started to organize another event in Budapest against former WBO featherweight champion and reigning EBU champion Steve Robinson. In June 2000 Kov√°cs vanquished a shutout victory against Robinson, grabbed the EBU belt and became the mandatory WBO challenger for Hamed. Hamed chose to relinquish the WBO belt and fight Mexican superstar Marco Antonio Barrera instead. The WBO ordered Kov√°cs and Antonio \\"Chelo\\" Diaz from the Dominican Republic to fight for Hamed's vacated belt. In January 2001 in Munich, on his twentieth professional fight, Kov√°cs TKOd Diaz in the 12th round and became the first Hungarian professional boxing world champion. Kov√°cs's first title defense match came in June 2001, against unheralded Argentinian Julio Pablo Chac√≥n. Chac√≥n also participated on the 1996 Olympics, and won a bronze medal in the featherweight division, coincidentally defeating another member of the Hungarian team J√°nos Nagy in the quarter-finals before losing to the eventual gold medalist Somluck Kamsing in the semis. He had a solid professional record but rarely fight outside Argentina, and one year before his fight against Kov√°cs he suffered a lopsided defeat against WBA champion Fred Norwood in Mendoza. With thousands of home supporters behind him Kov√°cs seemed to be the overwhelming favourite of the bout. However, on 16 June 2001 Chac√≥n shocked the Hungarian crowd by knocking out Kov√°cs in the sixth round. In the first four rounds Kov√°cs built up a comfortable lead on all scorecards, but in the fifth Chac√≥n rocked him with a monstre right hook. Kov√°cs's knees buckled, and though he did not go down and spread his arms to show that he is OK, he was rightfully counted on by the referee. Still shaken by punch (which was the first knockdown since his amateur career) and urged by the fans, instead of trying to survive the round he went after his opponent and only seconds before the bell he was caught again, this time by a huge left hook and was floored. He stood up visibly in trouble, only to be saved by the end of the round. His former coach Imre Sz√°nt√≥, acting as a TV commentator kept telling in the break that he should not continue the fight, yet Kov√°cs came out for the sixth round, only to be knocked down by Chac√≥n again in a few seconds, and the referee calling the bout to a halt immediately. This was one of the major boxing upsets in 2001, though it was overshadowed by the likes of Lennox Lewis losing to Hasim Rahman and F√©lix Trinidad losing to Bernard Hopkins. In Hungary Kov√°cs was considered as a national hero, and his loss was considered by many as a national tragedy. Rematch clause was not included in the fight contract, and Chac√≥n went on to defend his title two times to other opponents before losing it to Scott Harrison in 2002. Later in 2003 F√©lix R√°cz, a Hungarian boxing manager came up with the idea of bringing Chac√≥n to Hungary again to fight against his former Olympian opponent J√°nos Nagy, who since then also turned professional, had an unbeaten record and held the WBO super- featherweight intercontinental title. The bout was entitled \\"The Revenge\\" in reference to the Chac√≥n-Kov√°cs fight, and ended in the 10th round in a controversial fashion after Nagy hit his opponent below the belt, and was not disqualified while Chacon was unwilling to continue after the allowed regaining time (a year later the two met again in Hungary in a non-title bout, this time Nagy narrowly outpointing Chac√≥n). As for Kov√°cs, he never seemed to be the same in the ring as before. He fought twice more against limited opposition with his former confidence visibly shaken, and after unsuccessful managerial attempts to set up another title fight for him, he retired for good in 2002. His professional record concluded 22-1-0. Retirement After retiring, Kov√°cs took up several media roles, hosted various TV shows, before settling for sports programmes. He also became a supervisor for WBO, and prot√©g√©d several fellow Hungarian boxers to his former professional club Universum, including former WBO light heavyweight and WBC cruiserweight champion Zsolt Erdei, former WBO super middleweight champion K√°roly Balzsay, super-bantamweight challenger Zsolt Bed√°k, and his flyweight brother P√°l Bed√°k.

It was introduced to the United States through Charleston, Savannah, New York and Philadelphia, but has origins in the Indian subcontinent. The dish was once included in the U.S. military's Meal, Ready- to-Eat packs, in honor of it being a favorite dish of George S. Patton. It has also appeared on television shows in both the United States and in the United Kingdom, with chefs Bobby Flay, Atul Kochhar and Cyrus Todiwala all cooking the dish. Todiwala served his version to Queen Elizabeth II as part of her Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Description In its basic form, country captain is a mild stew made with browned chicken pieces, onions, and curry powder. Almonds and golden raisins or zante currants are usually added. Many versions also call for tomatoes, garlic, and bell peppers. The dish is served over white rice. With the exception of the rice, it is meant to be cooked all in the same pot. Chef Mamrej Khan has referred to the dish as one of the first fusion dishes to be developed, making it part of the Anglo-Indian cuisine. Country captain originated in India as a simple spatchcock poultry or game recipe involving onions and curry and possibly enjoyed by British officers. One theory is that an early 19th-century British sea captain, possibly from the East India Company, working in the spice trade introduced it to the American South via the port of Savannah. The dish remains popular amongst the communities in Mumbai, India. The \\"country\\" part of the dish's name dates from when the term referred to things of Indian origin instead of British, and so the term \\"country captain\\" would have meant a captain of Indian origin, a trader along the coasts of India. Others claim that the word \\"captain\\" in the title is simply a corruption of the word \\"capon\\". In 1991, The New York Times columnist Molly O‚ÄôNeill researched the origin of the dish known as country captain, which had been a steady feature in southern cookbooks since the 1950s. Working with Cecily Brownstone, they discovered that the dish originally published in the United States in the pages of Miss Leslie‚Äôs New Cookery Book published in Philadelphia in 1857. The recipe required a \\"fine full-grown fowl\\". It also appeared in the kitchens of Alessandro Filippini, who was a chef with a restaurant on Wall Street in the 18th century. Fans of the dish have included Franklin D. Roosevelt, who introduced it to George S. Patton. It was Patton's love for the dish which subsequently resulted in it being added in his honor to the U.S. Army's Meal, Ready-to-Eat field rations in 2000. A variety of Southern chefs have recipes for the dish, including Paul Prudhomme, Paula Deen and Emeril Lagasse. The dish was featured on an episode of Throwdown! with Bobby Flay in season 6 guest-starring Matt and Ted Lee. It also appeared on the BBC One cooking show, Saturday Kitchen, with chef Atul Kochhar cooking the regular chicken and rice version of the dish. Variations Chef Cyrus Todiwala cooked a variation of country captain on Saturday Kitchen. His version was similar to shepherd's pie, in that the meat was baked under a layer of potato. He had previously cooked the dish for Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh at Krishna Avanti Primary School in Harrow as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012. That version of the dish used a rare breed of lamb from the Orkney Islands which had been fed on seaweed. The dish is also now on the menu of Todiwala's London restaurant, Caf√© Spice Namast√©.

Although it did not see service in a combat theater, it pioneered design innovations in American cargo aircraft, later incorporated in modern military cargo airlifters. Design and development World War II created a great demand for military transport aircraft in the United States. Because of initial fears of a shortage of aluminum, the War Department explored the use of other materials for aircraft construction. Budd, the developer of the shotweld technique for welding stainless steel and a manufacturer of stainless steel railroad cars, automobile, bus, and truck bodies, hired an aeronautical engineering staff and worked with the U. S. Navy to develop a new twin-engine transport aircraft constructed primarily of stainless steel. The U.S. Navy accepted the proposal for the new aircraft, and placed an order for 200, to be designated RB-1. The U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) followed with an order for 600, designated C-93. The Conestoga was a twin-engine high-wing monoplane with tricycle landing gear. The elevated flight deck was contained in a distinctive, almost hemispherical nose section. Its two Pratt & Whitney R-1830-92 air cooled 14-cylinder, twin-row, radial engines, the same engines fitted to the C-47, drove three-bladed Hamilton Standard Hydromatic constant-speed, full-feathering propellers and powered a 24-volt electrical system. While the fuselage was thin-gauge stainless steel, only a portion of the wing was made of the metal; the trailing section of the wing and all control surfaces were fabric-covered. Innovations An RB-1 demonstrates its loading ramp The RB-1/C-93 was radical for its day, introducing many of the features now standard in military transports. The flight deck could accommodate three crew members, pilot and copilot side-by- side, the navigator behind them. Stairs connected the flight deck to the cargo area, which was long with an unobstructed cross-section of 8 √ó 8 feet (2.4m) throughout its length. Cargo loading and unloading could be accomplished in two ways: through 40 √ó 60 inch (102 √ó 152 cm) doors on both sides of the fuselage or by an electrically operated 10 √ó 8 foot (3.0 √ó 2.4 m) ramp at the aft end of the cargo area under the upswept tail, a similar development to what had been initially fitted to the Germans' own Ju 90 four-engined transport aircraft as their Trapoklappe ramp in 1939. The RB-1's loading ramp, accessed by manually operated clamshell doors, along with the tricycle landing gear, meant cargo could be loaded/unloaded at truck-bed height. A manually operated two-ton (907 kg) hoist for unloading trucks and a one-ton winch for pulling cargo up the ramp were also provided in the cargo area. The aircraft could accommodate: *24 paratroopers, or *24 stretchers and 16 sitting wounded, or *9,600 pounds of cargo, or *a 1¬Ω ton truck, or *The largest ambulance in use by the U.S. military. Operational history The prototype first flew from the Budd Red Lion Factory Airfield in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 31 October 1943, piloted by Guy Miller.Juptner, Joseph P. U.S. Civil Aircraft Series. Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania: TAB Aero, 1993. . The prototype had a takeoff run when empty of just , and could carry a maximum payload of with a takeoff run of .Merriam 2000, p. 45. However, the aircraft demonstrated greater than expected fuel consumption; the range with a standard payload was only , with a maximum payload. Three prototype aircraft: NX37097, NX41810, and NC45354 were built; one was used for testing radio equipment, while the other two were used for flight test evaluations.Freeman, Paul. \\"Budd Factory Airfield, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\\" airfields-freeman.com. Retrieved: 13 November 2010. During testing, a few aircraft had difficulty with the simultaneous deployment of the right and left landing gear. With the same engines as the C-47, but heavier (empty), the aircraft was relatively underpowered; it was reportedly said that, for an aircraft built by a railroad car company, it indeed handled like one. At the Budd factory and airfield in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, there were construction delays due to cost overruns and problems with stainless steel fabrication. By late 1943, aluminum production had been increased with the construction of new processing facilities, and other more conventional cargo aircraft (such as the Curtiss C-46 Commando and the Douglas C-47 Skytrain) were being produced in large numbers. This caused the Army to cancel its order for the C-93 and the Navy to reduce its RB-1 order from 200 to 25, of which 17 were delivered in March 1944. On 13 April 1944, during a Naval Air Training Command (NATC) evaluation flight of RB-1 prototype U.S. Navy NX37097 at Patuxent River NAS, Maryland, the aircraft crashed, killing one of the crew.\\"Report of Aircraft Accident, U.S. Navy NX37097 (Budd RB-1 Conestoga), 13 April 1944.\\" Aviation-Safety.net. Retrieved: 13 November 2010. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and written off, but the pilot reported that the stainless steel construction of the aircraft contributed to saving his life. Production RB-1 aircraft never entered squadron service with the Navy, but a few were briefly used by Naval Air Stations as utility aircraft. With only 17 aircraft in inventory, the RB-1 was not feasible to maintain on the active list, and it was retired from U.S. Navy service in early 1945. The extant RB-1s were then transferred to the War Assets Administration (WAA) to be sold as war surplus. In 1945, the WAA sold 12 Conestogas to the National Skyway Freight Corp\\"Flying Tiger History: The 1940s.\\" flyingtigerline.org. Retrieved: 13 November 2010. for $28,642 each at a time when new C-47s were selling for approximately $100,000 each. The new company, founded by members of the AVG Flying Tigers immediately sold four RB-1 aircraft to other buyers, which paid for the entire WAA contract. The seven remaining National Skyways aircraft were used to transport a variety of cargo, shipping fruit and furniture from its base in Long Beach, California. Pilots reported that the Budd transports were temperamental; in particular, exhaust stacks kept falling off and causing engine fires. There were three more crashes of Conestogas while in service with National Skyway Freight, one each in Virginia, New Mexico, and Michigan. The crash in Virginia was a belly landing at a country club brought on by fuel exhaustion following weather- related problems. The Albuquerque, New Mexico crash was due to a downdraft during a snow storm, from Albuquerque. Pilot and copilot were killed when they were thrown through the windshield and the aircraft skidded over them; the flight engineer survived. In 1947, the U.S. Army (and later the U.S. Air Force) gave National Skyway Freight a large contract for trans-Pacific freight, for which it leased military aircraft. The company changed its name to Flying Tiger and replaced the RB-1s with C-47s for its U.S. freight routes; the RB-1s were sold off to other buyers. One of these aircraft, a prototype RB-1, \\"NC45354\\" was sold to the Tucker Motor Company to transport its demonstration 1948 Tucker Sedan to auto shows around the U.S.; it was reportedly later abandoned at an airfield in Oakland, California after repeated mechanical troubles. Brazil The V.A.S.D. (Via√ß√£o A√©rea Santos Dumont) was born on January 18, 1944. He started with the purchase of two Catalinas and a Budd Conestoga, both former Rubber development Corporation. Budd RB.1 Conestoga had the PP-SDC \\"Tio Sam\\" enrollment. It was damaged in an emergency landing at Campo dos Afonsos on 04.01.1947, landing with one train collected, declared unrecoverable and there scrapped.

In his 2010 essay \\"David Foster Wallace and the New Sincerity in American Fiction\\", Adam Kelly argues that Wallace's fiction, and that of his generation, is marked by a revival and theoretical reconception of sincerity, challenging the emphasis on authenticity that dominated twentieth-century literature and conceptions of the self.Adam Kelly. \\"David Foster Wallace and the New Sincerity in American Fiction\\".

As a cultural movement \\"The New Sincerity\\" has been espoused since 2002 by radio host Jesse Thorn of PRI's The Sound of Young America (now Bullseye), self- described as \\"the public radio program about things that are awesome\\". Thorn characterizes New Sincerity as a cultural movement defined by dicta including \\"Maximum Fun\\" and \\"Be More Awesome\\". It celebrates outsized celebration of joy, and rejects irony, and particularly ironic appreciation of cultural products. Thorn has promoted this concept on his program and in interviews.Ben Kharakh, \\"Jesse Thorn, America's Radio Sweetheart\\" in Gothamist, posted November 2, 2006.\\"Interview: Jesse Thorn, Part 1\\" , The Merlin Show, posted June 4, 2007.Dan Brodnitz, \\"An Interview with The Sound of Young America's Jesse Thorn\\" , O'Reilly Digital Media, posted September 15, 2008.But see Bill Forman, \\"M√ºz: The New Ambiguity\\", Metro Santa Cruz, March 8‚Äì15, 2006 (opining that New Sincerity is \\"just another ironic hoax\\"). In a September 2009 interview, Thorn commented that \\"new sincerity\\" had begun as \\"a silly, philosophical movement that me and some friends made up in college\\" and that \\"everything that we said was a joke, but at the same time it wasn't all a joke in the sense that we weren't being arch or we weren't being campy. While we were talking about ridiculous, funny things we were sincere about them.\\"Jonathan Valania, \\"Q&A;: With Jesse Thorn, America‚Äôs Radio Sweetheart\\", Phawker, September 15, 2009. Thorn's concept of \\"new sincerity\\" as a social response has gained popularity since his introduction of the term in 2002. Several point to the September 11, 2001, attacks and the subsequent wake of events that created this movement, in which there was a drastic shift in tone. The 1990s were considered a period of artistic works ripe with irony, and the attacks shocked a change in the American culture. Graydon Carter, editor of Vanity Fair, published an editorial a few weeks after the attacks claiming that \\"this was the end of the age of irony\\". Jonathan D. Fitzgerald for The Atlantic suggests this new movement could also be attributed to broader periodic shifts that occur in culture. As a result of this movement, several cultural works, including many identified above, were considered elements of \\"new sincerity\\", but this was also seen to be a mannerism adopted by the general public, to show appreciation for cultural works that they happened to enjoy. Andrew Watercutter of Wired saw this as having being able to enjoy one's guilty pleasures without having to feel guilty about enjoying it, and being able to share that appreciation with others. One such example of a \\"new sincerity\\" movement is the brony fandom, generally adult and primarily male fans of the 2010 animated show My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic which is produced by Hasbro to sell its toys to young girls. These fans have been called \\"internet neo-sincerity at its best\\", unabashedly enjoying the show and challenging the preconceived gender roles that such a show ordinarily carries. Regional variants This conception of \\"new sincerity\\" meant the avoidance of cynicism, but not necessarily of irony. In the words of Alexei Yurchak of the University of California, Berkeley,Alexei Yurchak biography at University of California, Berkeley Department of Anthropology website (retrieved February 15, 2009). it \\"is a particular brand of irony, which is sympathetic and warm, and allows its authors to remain committed to the ideals that they discuss, while also being somewhat ironic about this commitment\\".Yurchak, at p.259 n.6, further explains this contrast in terms of Susan Sontag's comment that a good writer should \\"Be serious. By which I meant: never be cynical. And which doesn't preclude being funny.\\" (Citing Sontag as quoted in Jenny Diski, \\"Seriously Uncool\\", London Review of Books 29, no. 6 (March 22, 2007).) In American poetry Since 2005, poets including Reb Livingston, Joseph Massey, Andrew Mister, and Anthony Robinson have collaborated in a blog-driven poetry movement, described by Massey as \\"a 'new sincerity' brewing in American poetry ‚Äì a contrast to the cold, irony-laden poetry dominating the journals and magazines and new books of poetry\\".Katy Henriksen, \\" Drunk Bunnies, The New Sincerity, Flarf: How Blogs are Transforming Poetry\\" , EconoCulture, January 23, 2007. Other poets named as associated with this movement, or its tenets, have included David Berman, Catherine Wagner, Dean Young, Matt Hart, Miranda July (who is also a filmmaker herself),Jameson, A.D. \\"What we talk about when we talk about the New Sincerity, part 1\\".

He represented the electoral district of Tantramar in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1997 to 2006. Mesheau was elected in a tight three-way race to represent Tantramar in a by-election in 1997 to replace Marilyn Trenholme Counsell who had resigned to become Lieutenant- Governor of New Brunswick. Mesheau, a Progressive Conservative received 34.1% of the vote to 33.2% for Liberal candidate Ross Monk to 30.2% for New Democrat Heather Patterson. The leader of the Confederation of Regions Party, Greg Hargrove, was running as a parachute candidate and finished a distant fourth and last place with 2.5%. The margin of victory between Mesheau and Monk was only 39 votes. Mesheau's victory happened in the midst of a leadership campaign for his party which was won shortly thereafter by Bernard Lord whom Mesheau supported. As a result, Mesheau was appointed to the high-profile role of Health Critic in the shadow cabinet. The Progressive Conservatives won the 1999 provincial election and Mesheau was named to the cabinet as Minister of Economic Development, Tourism and Culture. Lord restructured the government in 2000 and Mesheau took over the new Department of Investments and Exports. In October 2001 Mesheau was promoted to the high-profile position of finance minister. Following the 2003 election, Mesheau was shuffled to Business New Brunswick, another department which had been carved out of his old Economic Development portfolio and one which had since annexed his old Investment and Exports department. In February 2006, he left the cabinet altogether as a part of a shuffle in anticipation for the 56th New Brunswick general election. Mesheau said he had left willingly as he did not intend to run for another term. Later in 2006, Mesheau became a part of a media frenzy when it was learned that he had found a job in the private sector and intended to resign his seat in the legislature. His resignation would create a minority government and Lord said he would call an election - 13 months earlier than scheduled - rather than face a hung parliament. The election was held on September 18, 2006 and though the Progressive Conservatives lost the government to the Liberals, the Tories retained Mesheau's Tantramar riding electing Mike Olscamp.

One murdered man near Gallup and the desecration of a Northeastern cemetery, protesting ineffectively the keeping of native American bones in the Smithsonian, lead Leaphorn and Chee, separately, to Washington D.C. to solve interlinked crimes and preserve Navajo cultural artifacts. Plot summary An unidentified man is found dead along the railroad tracks near Gallup, New Mexico. There is a note in one pocket of his suit referring to Agnes Tsotsie and a Yeibichai or Night Chant ceremony. FBI agent Kennedy calls on Lt. Leaphorn to aid in finding footprints near the body. There are no footprints to follow, but the note sends him to interview Agnes Tsotsie, who shows him the letter from Henry Highhawk, who will attend her Night Chant. Always curious, Leaphorn learns that an Amtrak train made an emergency stop in the desert, the likely explanation for the body found near the railroad tracks with no footprints around him. The man's left-behind luggage is now stored in Washington D.C. Leaphorn takes his vacation in Washington D.C. to follow up on Pointed Shoes. Leaphorn talks with Roland Dockery and Peres of Amtrak, who show him the luggage, which holds a useful notebook. Peres saw the man now known to be the killer of Pointed Toes. The notebook includes the name and prescription number for a medicine he took, revealing both the name and address of Elogio Santillanes. Leaphorn proceeds to inform the next of kin, who are rather quiet in receiving the news. He then notices that their next door neighbor matches the description of the killer. As Santillanes was tortured, Leaphorn suspects the family home might be bugged, so leaves them with the sad news. Leaphorn calls Kennedy to match fingerprints under the victim's proper name. Leaphorn calls the NTP, learning that Chee was arresting officer for Highhawk and is now in D.C. An arrest warrant is issued for Henry Highhawk, who stole human remains from a New England cemetery and then crossed state lines. Highhawk is attending a Night Chant ceremony on the Navajo Reservation, where Jim Chee arrests him with aid from his friend Cowboy Dashee, for the FBI. Chee sees the masks that are integral to the last day of the ceremony. Chee gets a letter from Mary Landon, his longtime love, saying he should not come to Wisconsin; they cannot resolve the cultural barrier between them. Minutes later, his friend Janet Pete calls him from Washington, D.C. Her newest client is Henry Highhawk, and she is afraid on several counts. Chee leaves to visit her, meeting Highhawk and Rudolfo Gomez on his first night in town. Pete points out the man she thinks is following her. Chee confronts him and he drives off. Chee visits Highhawk at his office in the museum, seeing the accurate detail of an upcoming exhibit on Masked Gods of the Americas, including the Navajo Talking God mask. Highhawk takes a phone call, telling Chee he will be back shortly. Chee leaves when Highhawk does not return, walking out past an unguarded exit. The next morning, Leaphorn goes to Chee's hotel, updating each other on why they came to Washington. They realize that both Gomez and Santelleros were tortured in Chile, must be leftists in exile, and are still hunted. Leaphorn calls his friend Captain Rodney, who joins them. Rodney knows Chee's name as having signed into the museum the night before, but not out. Rodney tells them of the murder of Mrs. Yokum, the guard. The three men find Highhawk's body in a museum storage bin, after Chee has maintenance look for something out of place as the guide to the emptied bin. They find Highhawk's tape recorder wired to his watch, and a replica Talking God mask. Leaphorn and Chee figure out why Gomez /Santerro sought a connection with Highhawk, and the danger of the proximity of Highhawk's exhibit to the Incan exhibit. The Chileans will not pay Leroy Fleck, their hired assassin, because the victim is identified. Fleck's revenge is to kill as many Chileans as he can, trailing them to the exhibit of Incan masks in the Natural History Museum with a high ranking general from the present rightist government, the same goal that brings Santerro. The Inca exhibit draws media coverage when the Chileans arrive. The Chilean leftists want to kill the rightists in Washington, and used Highhawk to set up the explosives. Tensions mount as Chee pulls apart the exhibit to find the plastic explosives packed under the mask, and Leaphorn kicks apart the remote detonator that falls from Santerro's hands. Fleck is shot twice by the Chilean body guard in the museum, after he kills the general and The Client with his shank, a very sharp tool. Leaphorn heads right back to Window Rock. The police tell Chee that Highhawk was found dead, killed by Santerro, who escaped. Chee finds a Tano Pueblo fetish in the trunk of Highhawk's car, and gives it to Janet Pete to return it to the Tano people, who are connected to her law firm. Mary Landon calls Chee, glad to hear him alive, but they end their relationship. Chee heads home.

Photographed by Benedict Kelly,18 January 2014 The old Granville Pavilion was damaged beyond repair in WW2 and was subsequently demolished. A new building was planned on the same site by the Borough Engineer (Mr R. D. Brimmell). The New Granville Theatre, as it was originally known, was designed by the architect Mr W. Garwood at a cost of ¬£13,100. After the war, building materials were in short supply. This meant that every usable brick from the old building was brought into use, with new blocks being made in the town. The theatre was declared open by the Mayor of Ramsgate (Alderman S. E. Austin) on Saturday 21 June 1947. East Kent Times 21 June 1947 The Granville Theatre has two large cinema screens, Dolby Surround Sound, lounge seats and free parking. The main cinema has a large flat performance space that is used for small- scale performances, conferences and functions. The second screen auditorium has a fully equipped 30 ft stage, used regularly for visiting professional, local amateur and in-house theatre productions. The complex also has a separate dance studio, theatre bar and facilities for the disabled. The Granville Theatre's Patron is the celebrated and award-winning actress Brenda Blethyn.

Since 1291, Murano glassmakers have refined technologies for producing beads and glasswork such as crystalline glass, enamelled glass (smalto), glass with threads of gold (aventurine), multicolored glass (millefiori), milk glass (lattimo) and imitation gemstones made of glass. Color The process of Murano bead-making begins with the production of color canes. The chemical compounds involved in color fabrication are extremely sensitive so they must be mixed with absolute accuracy. Aquamarine is created through the use of copper and cobalt, and ruby red is achieved through the use of a gold solution as a coloring agent. Lampworked beads Most Murano beads are made using an air pump burner lampworking or torch and mandrel technique. Once the mandrel was made by using an iron rod covered with a release material stuck on the top of the rod; now a copper tube has taken its place. The copper tube helps make many other different shapes. The lamp-work method is the most time-consuming method of glass bead-making, as each bead must be formed individually. Using a torch for heat, Murano glass rods and tubes are heated to a molten state and wrapped around a metal rod until the desired shape is achieved. Several layers of different colored glass, as well as gold and silver leaf, are used to produce the desired effect. After the bead is slowly cooled, it is removed from the rod, resulting in a hole for eventual stringing as jewelry. Wedding cake beads known as Fiorato (decorated with glass overlays featuring roses, swirls and dots) and Venetian foil beads (with fusion of color, gold and silver foil) are two of the kinds of beads made using the lamp-work method. Seedbeads or conterie Seedbeads or conterie are small, round beads. To produce this tiny bead, hollow tubes of colored glass are formed, then chopped and re-fired for smoothness and shade. Chevron or Rosetta beads First produced in Murano at the end of the 14th century, these beads are made of a hollow cane and six layers of glass: white, blue, white, brick red, white and finally blue. After this layering of color, these beads are ground to produce patterns of five concentric stars with twelve points. The canes are then sliced into individual beads. The Chevron bead is distinguished by a red, white and blue zigzag pattern. Millefiori or lace beads The abstract millefiori beads are created in a manner similar to that of chevron or rosetta beads. There is a wider use of color and the glass cane is not hollow, but completely solid. Blown beads When the lamp-work flame was introduced, beadmakers discovered they could melt the canes and blow the glass. Today this glassblowing is called the Filigrana or filigree method. To produce these beads with stripes of color and spirals, glassmakers lay canes of glass down and pick them up with a blow-pipe.

Coming of Age features Paul Dooley and Phyllis Newman as Dick and Ginny Hale, who lived in a retirement community in Arizona. Dick resented his retirement - a former airline pilot, he had been forced to retire by a Federal Aviation Administration rule that requires all U.S. commercial pilots to retire by age 60. Dick hated almost everything about his retirement, including his surroundings. He was appalled by the hot climate, the thin walls separating the Hale's apartment from that of their neighbors (Alan Young and Glynis Johns), and mostly by the contented attitude of the other residents including Pauline Spencer (Ruta Lee). This program was first aired as a midseason replacement in March 1988. It was not well received and was pulled from the schedule after only three episodes were aired. Nevertheless, it was added to the CBS 1988 fall lineup. It failed again, and was quickly pulled from the schedule. The airing of more episodes in June and July 1989 was a \\"burn-off\\", an attempt to recoup at least some of the investment in the show by using it as filler during the traditionally low- rated summer months.

The XB-43 was a development of the XB-42, replacing the piston engines of the XB-42 with two General Electric J35 engines of 4,000 lbf (17.8 kN) thrust each. Despite being the first American jet bomber to fly, it suffered stability issues and the design did not enter production. Design and development United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) leaders in the Air Materiel Command began to consider the possibilities of jet-propelled bombers as far back as October 1943. At that time, Douglas Aircraft was just beginning to design a promising twin-engine bomber designated the XB-42. Reciprocating engines powered this aircraft but they were buried in the fuselage, leaving the laminar flow-airfoil wing clean of any drag-inducing pylon mounts or engine cowlings. The airframe appeared ideally suited to test turbojet propulsion. Douglas confirmed the feasibility of the concept and the USAAF amended the XB-42 contract in March 1944 to include the development of two turbojet-powered XB-43 prototypes, reduced from an initial order of 13 test aircraft.O'Leary 1994, p. 75. The Douglas design team convinced the Army that modifying the XB-42 static test airframe into the first XB-43 was a relatively straightforward process that would save time and money compared to developing a brand new design. Douglas replaced the two Allison V-1710 engines with a pair of General Electric (GE) J35 turbojets (the first American axial-flow jet engines ever used), then cut two air intakes into each side of the fuselage, aft of the pressurized cockpit. Removing the propellers and drive shafts freed enough space for two long jet exhaust ducts. Without any propellers present, there was no chance of striking the blade tips on the runway, so the entire ventral fin/rudder unit of the earlier XB-42's full four-surface cruciform tail was omitted. Douglas compensated for the loss of yaw stability by enlarging the dorsal fin/rudder unit. Douglas Aircraft was keen to mass- produce the new bomber and the USAAF considered ordering 50. The company was poised to roll out as many as 200 B-43s per month in two versions: a bomber equipped with a clear plastic nose for the bombardier, and an attack aircraft without the clear nose and bombing station but carrying 16 forward-firing .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns and 36 5 in (127 mm) rockets. Nothing came of these plans. The USAAF was already moving ahead with a new bomber, the XB-45 Tornado, designed from the outset for turbojet power and promising major improvement in every category of performance. Operational history The second aircraft, YB-43 Versatile II, taking off. Undated. Note the solid, orange nose-cone that replaced the original clear nose As Douglas predicted, the work itself was not overly complex but almost two years were required to ready the aircraft for flight due to delays in obtaining the J35 powerplants. The end of World War II caused a general slowdown within the aviation industry and GE was late delivering the engines. When they were at last installed and tested on the ground, one of the units failed catastrophically. Compressor blades exploded through the engine casing, damaging the surrounding airframe and injuring a ground technician. Another seven-month delay ensued for repairs. America's first turbojet bomber finally flew from Muroc Army Air Base on 17 May 1946, piloted by Douglas test pilot, Bob Brush, accompanied by engineer Russell Thaw. Caught in a momentous technological shift, the XB-43 contributed to developing procedures for flying the new jet bombers, and it gave yeoman service testing new turbojet engines. Douglas completed the second prototype, AAF serial number 44-61509, flying on 15 May 1947 and delivered it to Muroc Air Force Base, California, in April 1948. The USAAF soon replaced one J35 turbojet engine with a General Electric J47. Douglas delivered the second prototype, designated YB-43, in April 1948. That aircraft was nicknamed Versatile II by USAAF personnel. When the clear plastic nose began to crack from variations in temperature at high and low altitudes, mechanics fashioned a more durable replacement made from plywood. To keep it flying, the US Air Force cannibalized parts from the first XB-43 after it was damaged in February 1951. Versatile II flew more than 300 hours until its retirement in December 1953. The U.S. Air Force only considered the first prototype to fall under the XB-43 designation. The second prototype, though functionally identical to the first, was designated YB-43, consistent with its status as a follow-on prototype under the Army's designation system for aircraft.

It is a four- year public high school in the Fredericksburg City Schools system. The school is named after James Monroe. The current school building opened to students in September 2006. James Monroe High School is part of the VHSL AA Battlefield District. James Monroe High School is fully accredited by the Virginia State Department of Education. History Opened in 1920, the building now known as Maury School was Fredericksburg's first real high school. It was originally called Fredericksburg High School, but in 1939, this name was changed to honor the nation's fifth president, James Monroe, who had his law office in the city from 1786-89. The second James Monroe High School building was constructed in 1952, and a wing was added in 1959. From 1981-83, a large renovation project modernized the entire building, and another wing was added. The Arthur H. Schwartz Memorial Athletic Complex was constructed during 1985-86, providing a new track, tennis courts, and a baseball field. Up until 2005, Fredericksburg City Public Schools used an unusual system of grade levels and schools. James Monroe High School carried 8th through 12th grades. However, the construction of a new upper elementary school in the school district in 2005 allowed for the system to become standardized. The class of 2009 was the last eighth grade class of James Monroe High School. Demolition of the old JM high school building, August 2006 The second high school was demolished in June through August 2006. The new replacement high school began construction in June 2004. It opened August 2006, and is built in the back of the second high school. The Class of 2010 was the first graduating class to go through all four years at the third JMHS.

It began as a weekly newspaper in 1831 and became a daily eight years later in 1839. It was the first Bengali daily newspaper. Sambad Prabhakar covered news on India and abroad and put forward its views on religion, politics, society, and literature. It was influential in the Bengali Renaissance and in building public sentiment leading to the indigo revolt.  History  Sambad Prabhakar was the brainchild of Ishwar Chandra Gupta. His patron was Jogendra Mohan Thakur of Pathuriaghata. It began as a weekly newspaper launched on 28 January 1831 (16 Magh 1237BS). As stated, Mr. Thakur was the backbone to this paper and his death caused the paper to close publication in 1832.

Together with lands to the north, including Chiwaukee Prairie, it forms the Chiwaukee Prairie Illinois Beach Lake Plain, an internationally recognized wet-land of importance under the Ramsar Convention. The park is broken into two units that encompass an area of and contains over six miles of Lake Michigan shoreline. Recreational activities at the park include boating, swimming, hiking, bicycling, camping, bird watching, and picnicking. Known primarily for the beach, the park also includes dune areas, wetlands, prairie, and black oak savanna. The area at the far southern end of the park is a designated nature preserve, which was named a National Natural Landmark in 1980. History The park was gradually created starting in 1948 when the state acquired the first parcels. The northern unit, acquired between 1971 and 1982, was previously an Illinois National Guard training facility known as Camp Logan, Illinois. During the American Civil War, Camp Logan was a Union prisoner of war camp.  Geology  The park is located in the 12 mile long Zion Beach Ridge Plain. The Zion Beach Ridge Plain is 3,700 years old and composed of curvilinear ridge- and-swale topography. The beach ridges support black oak savanna habitat, while wetlands dominate the swales. The Zion Beach Ridge Plain has been migrating south throughout the late Holocene: the northern portion of the beach ridge erodes; freed sediment is then transported through the dominantly southward littoral drift and deposited on the southern portion of the beach ridge. This erosion and subsequent accretion process created the characteristically curved ridges and swales of the park as the complex migrates south. The northern unit of Illinois Beach State Park experiences rapid rates of erosion, which was exacerbated by the construction of North Point Marina in 1989 and reaches highs of 60 ft per year. The southward migration of the beach ridge plain has been disrupted by the construction of Waukegan Harbor. Erosion in the north unit of the park is exacerbated during periods of high lake level. As Lake Michigan has entered a period near record high lake levels since 2014, the park is experiencing rapid transgression of the shoreline. Access The entry to the beach is usually from a parking area on its north side: north of this carpark is usually the most crowded area in the summer time. South, the beach is less crowded and a mile of shoreline extends to an inlet into a wetland. Depending on weather conditions this inlet may be blocked by a berm from the lake waters, and again depending on weather conditions the water inside the berm may be significantly warmer than Lake Michigan which is rather cold until August. Management As the South Unit is not in an actual municipality, the police protection is provided by the Lake County Sheriff's Department. The fire and emergency medical services are provided by the Beach Park Fire Department. The water is supplied by the City of Zion, and telephone service is through the Waukegan switch. The North Unit is in Winthrop Harbor, Illinois which provides primary police and fire/emergency medical services. Both properties also fall under the jurisdiction of the Illinois Department of Conservation Police. Water service is also provided by Zion and phone service comes thorough the Zion/Winthrop Harbor switch.

It is Work Number 26 in the composer's catalog of works. History The seven days of the title were 7‚Äì13 May 1968. Although this coincided with the beginning of the May 1968 protests and general strike in Paris, Stockhausen does not appear to have been aware of them at the time. These texts were written at Stockhausen's home in K√ºrten during the first five of those days, at night or late in the evening . During daylight hours, including the remaining two days, Stockhausen wrote ‚Äúmany poems,‚Äù as well as reading Satprem‚Äôs book on Sri Aurobindo, and experienced ‚Äúmany extraordinary things‚Äù . Some of the poems appear in . The first of the pieces to be officially premiered was Es, performed in Brussels on 15 December 1968 on a concert of the Rencontre de Musique Contemporaine, by the Stockhausen Group, joined by Michel Portal, Jean-Pierre Drouet, and Jean- Fran√ßois Jenny-Clark. Setz die Segel zur Sonne followed, as part of a concert at the Th√©√¢tre National Populaire, Palais de Chaillot in Paris, on 30 May 1969 . However, an earlier, unofficial performance of both Es and Treffpunkt, by the Arts Laboratory Ensemble with Hugh Davies and trombonist Vinko Globokar with Stockhausen at the potentiometers, took place on 25 November 1968 in London, as part of the Macnaghten Concerts (; ). Unbegrenzt was first given 26 July 1969 during the Nuits de la Fondation Maeght in St Paul de Vence, by Guy Arnaud, , Jean-Fran√ßois Jenny-Clark, Jean-Pierre Drouet, Johannes G. Fritsch, Roy Hart, Diego Masson, Michel Portal, Michael Vetter, and the composer . An \\"ill-fated\\" performance of the theatre piece Oben und Unten was attempted in Amsterdam at the Holland Festival on 22 June 1969. The three actors were Sigrid Koetse (woman), Jan Ret√®l (man), and Keesjan van Deelen (child), with the instrumentalists of the Stockhausen Group and the composer doing the sound projection (; ). Goldstaub was only performed for the first time (though without an audience) for the DG recording made at Stockhausen‚Äôs house in K√ºrten on 20 August 1972, by P√©ter E√∂tv√∂s (electrochord, keisu, and rin), Herbert Henck (voice, sitar, cooking pot with some water, two small bells, ship bell), Michael Vetter (voice, hands, recorder), and the composer (voice, conch horn, large cowbell, keisu, 14 rin, jug and key with water, kandy drum, pellet-bells on a strap) . Stockhausen described as \\"crucial\\" an orchestral performance in London of Set sail for the Sun on 14 January 1970, in which the BBC Symphony Orchestra, rehearsed by the composer, was distributed around the audience in four groups, each with a \\"core player\\" from the Stockhausen Group . Other notable performances include the 1969 Darmst√§dter Ferienkurse, when the groups that had just finished the recordings for DG performed eleven of the texts in four public seminars, on 1‚Äì4 September in the St√§dtische Sporthalle am B√∂llenfalltor (; , many of the texts in multiple daily performances from 14 March to 14 September 1970 in the spherical auditorium of the German pavilion at Expo '70 in Osaka (; ), and at the 1972 Shiraz Arts Festival, where a day of \\"Music in the City\\" on 7 September featured several component pieces of Aus den sieben Tagen performed at various places in the inner city from dawn to dusk (; ). Content The fifteen constituent pieces are: # Richtige Dauern (Right Durations), for ca. 4 players # Unbegrenzt (Unlimited), for ensemble # Verbindung (Connection), for ensemble # Treffpunkt (Meeting Point), for ensemble # Nachtmusik (Night Music), for ensemble # Abw√§rts (Downward), for ensemble # Aufw√§rts (Upward), for ensemble # Oben und Unten (Above and Below), theater piece, for a man, a woman, a child, and 4 instrumentalists # Intensit√§t (Intensity), for ensemble # Setz die Segel zur Sonne (Set Sail for the Sun), for ensemble # Kommunion (Communion), for ensemble # Litanei (Litany), for speaker or choir # Es (It), for ensemble # Goldstaub (Gold Dust), for ensemble # Ankunft (Arrival), for speaker or speaking choir Often regarded as meditation exercises or prayers (; ; ; ), all but two of these texts nonetheless describe in words specific musical events: \\"I don't want some spiritistic sitting‚ÄîI want music! I don't mean something mystical, but rather everything completely direct, from concrete experience\\" (Stockhausen, quoted in ). Despite the manner of notation, Stockhausen's approach remains essentially serial: > In his cycle FROM THE SEVEN DAYS Stockhausen attempts to find musical > answers to such fundamental questions regarding the conditions of a > harmonious interplay of spirit and matter, which correspond to his serial > process thinking and to the maxims of the experimental production of the > sound material by composing temporally ordered pulses. . . . As a composer > he wants to mediate between the extremes rather than to just follow the > preconception of a linear development from the fragmentary and dissonant to > the whole and harmonious. Each text focuses on one or several of Stockhausen's main artistic concerns, such as extending the listener's perceptions of time and pitch, reconciling opposing tendencies, or shifting awareness from one perceptual area to another. Specific earlier works may be reflected in certain of the texts. Intensit√§t, for example, suggests a passage from Kontakte, and Unbegrenzt recalls large parts of Carr√© . The influence of performing Prozession and Kurzwellen can be heard in the recordings made by Stockhausen's own ensemble. In addition, pianist Aloys Kontarsky frequently alludes to Stockhausen's Klavierst√ºcke (especially Klavierst√ºck IX in Abw√§rts) and Harald Boj√© sometimes evokes Kontakte with his electronium . The most detailed text is the central one, Oben und Unten, which gives instructions for three actors and a group of instrumentalists. Twelve of the other pieces describe musical processes or states, in three different general types, and the remaining two, Litanei and Ankunft are more in the nature of manifestos, to be read aloud either by a single speaker or a speaking choir (; ). In 1997, Stockhausen made a performing version of the former text, considerably reworked under the title Litanei 97, for a speaking choir with occasional sung interjections. This was given the separate work number 74 in Stockhausen's catalogue of works. Related works Between 1968 and 1971, Stockhausen composed a companion set of 17 text pieces, titled F√ºr kommende Zeiten (For Times to Come). There are two further text compositions, Ylem (1972) and Herbstmusik (1974), though they are not actually described as \\"intuitive music\\", and are considerably more detailed \\"scripts\\" for what amount to a large \\"statistical\\" structure (Ylem) and a theatre piece (Herbstmusik) with certain features of moment form .

The historical account of his involvement in the Third Servile War is incomplete, but we know that an advance force of 2,000 led by his legate, Lucius Furius, was defeated and that a later encounter also ended in the defeat of another 4,000 men. Varinius later held the office as governor of the province of Asia in 65 BC. Portrayals in film or television Varinius, played by Australian actor Brett Tucker, is a secondary antagonist in the Starz series Spartacus: Vengeance. He's a military and political figure of some importance, holding the rank of praetor, like Glaber (Craig Parker); as such, due to the competitive nature of Roman politics, the two are rivals. Glaber is constantly at odds with Varinius and eventually sees him killed by a flaming stone shot from a catapult during an attack on Spartacus. Varinius was portrayed by Niall Refoy in the 2004 miniseries Spartacus. He was renamed as Publius Maximus.

Stein Mart has locations primarily in the Southeast, Texas, and California. Stein Mart stores carry recent trends in clothing for both men and women. Additionally, home decor, accessories, and shoes are all available at discounted prices. In August 2020, the company announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and that it planned to close all of its 279 stores. History Stein Mart store at the South Mall in Allentown, Pennsylvania Stein Mart was founded in 1908 by Sam Stein, a Russian Jewish immigrant who opened his first store in Greenville, Mississippi. The department store carried general merchandise until his son, Jake Stein, took over the company upon his father Sam's death in 1932. The store then redirected its focus toward discounted clothing. The chain targeted customers who shopped department stores on a regular basis, inducing them to purchase goods by offering discounts of 25 to 60 percent off department store prices. By the late 1970s, Stein Mart had become a leading retailer of clothing for the family in the Mississippi Delta. Under Jay Stein's leadership, Stein Mart grew from three stores in 1977 to 40 stores in 1990, and then to 123 stores by the end of 1996. In determining the prime locations for new Stein Mart stores, management targeted cities with populations of 125,000 or more and relied on demographic research regarding income, education, and occupation to help predict whether a community might support a discounter of designer merchandise. In 2003, Stein Mart introduced the \\"Real Shopper\\" campaign with support from Orlando-based advertising agency, Fry Hammond Barr. This multimedia advertising campaign features real Stein Mart shoppers chosen via casting calls held throughout the country. Each season six to eight female shoppers are chosen to appear in the campaign and are featured in Stein Mart's Sisterhood book online. In 2013, the company reported a profit of $25.6 million with operation of 260 stores in 29 states. In October 2017, in response to the downward trend of the company's stock price, the company announced plans to improve its financials by cutting 10% of their corporate staff, trimming inventory by 15%, slashing $22 million from the prior year's capital expenses, and suspending the 4th quarter stock dividend. In January 2018, Stein Mart announced that it would explore strategic alternatives for the company. In February 2020, Stein Mart entered into a deal to make the company private; its common stock would no longer be listed on any public stock market. The transaction is subject to approval by Stein Mart shareholders and was \\"expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2020.\\" On August 12, 2020, Stein Mart filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Later, it was announced that all Stein Mart locations would be closing permanently.  Leadership  In 2002, Jay Stein stepped down as CEO but remained as chairman and the largest Stein Mart shareholder. John H. Williams Jr. served as vice chairman and chief executive officer of the company from September 2001 to February 2003 and still serves on the Stein Mart board. Michael D. Fisher held the position of president and chief executive officer of the company from 2003 to August 2007. At that time, Fisher resigned and Linda McFarland Farthing was appointed as president and chief executive officer of Stein Mart. Farthing had been a longtime Stein Mart board member and held the president and CEO position for one year. Upon her resignation in 2008, David H. Stovall Jr., served as CEO until 2011. In September 2011, he announced his retirement, leaving Jay Stein to take over as the interim CEO. On April 25, 2014, Stein Mart announced that the Board of Directors had created the Office of the President, appointing D. Hunt Hawkins and Brian R. Morrow to share the office.

P. Lovecraft. Written in 1926, it is considered part of his Dreamlands series. It was first published in the January 1929 issue of Weird Tales. It is a continuation of \\"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath\\", and was followed by a sequel, \\"Through the Gates of the Silver Key\\", co-written with E. Hoffmann Price. The story and its sequel both feature Lovecraft's recurring character of Randolph Carter as the protagonist. Plot Randolph Carter discovers, at the age of 30, that he has gradually \\"lost the key to the gate of dreams.\\" Randolph once believed life is made up of nothing but pictures in memory, whether they be from real life or dreams. He highly prefers his romantic nightly dreams of fantastic places and beings to the \\"prosiness of life\\". He believes his dreams to reveal truths missing from man's waking ideas, regarding the purpose of humans and the universe, primary among these being the truth of beauty as perceived and invented by humans in times past. As he ages, though, he finds that his daily waking exposure to the more \\"practical\\", scientific ideas of man has eroded his ability to dream as he once did and has made him, regretfully, subscribe more and more to the mundane beliefs of everyday, waking \\"real life\\". But, still not certain which is truer, he sets out to determine whether the waking ideas of man are superior to his dreams, and in the process, he passes through several unsatisfying philosophical stances. Discouraged, he eventually withdraws from these lines of inquiry, and goes into seclusion. After a time, a hint of the fantastic enters his dreams again, though he is still unable to dream of the strange cities of his youth, leaving him wanting more. During one of these dreams, his long-dead grandfather tells him of a silver key in his attic, inscribed with mysterious arabesque symbols, which he finds and takes with him on a visit to his boyhood home in the backwoods of northeastern Massachusetts (the setting for many of Lovecraft's stories), where he enters a mysterious cave that he used to play in. The key somehow enables him to return to his childhood as a ten-year-old boy, and his adult self disappears from his normal time. The story then relates how Randolph's relatives had noted, beginning at the age of ten, that he had somehow gained the ability to glimpse events in his future. The narrator of the story then states that he expects to meet Randolph soon, in one of his own dreams, \\"in a certain dream-city we both used to haunt\\", reigning there as a new king, where the narrator may look at Randolph's key, whose symbols he hopes will tell him the mysteries of the cosmos. Connections \\"The Silver Key\\" alludes to other Lovecraft stories that feature Randolph Carter, allowing the reader to place these stories in chronological order: first The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath, then \\"The Statement of Randolph Carter\\", followed by \\"The Unnamable\\". \\"The Silver Key\\" and \\"Through the Gates of the Silver Key\\" are set at the end of this sequence. An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia compares \\"The Silver Key\\" to Lovecraft's early story \\"The Tomb\\", whose narrator, Jervas Dudley, also \\"discovers in his attic a physical key that allows him to unlock the secrets of the past.\\" Inspiration \\"The Silver Key\\" is thought to have been inspired in part by Lovecraft's visit to Foster, Rhode Island, where his maternal ancestors lived. The character Benijah Corey from the story seems to combine the names of Emma Corey Phillips, one of Lovecraft's relatives, and Benejah Place, a farmer who lived across the street from the home where Lovecraft stayed. Carter's search for meaning through a succession of philosophical and aesthetic approaches may have been inspired by J. K. Huysmans' A rebours (1884), whose main character undertakes a similar progression. Reaction Weird Tales editor Farnsworth Wright rejected \\"The Silver Key\\" when Lovecraft submitted it in mid-1927. The next year, however, Wright asked to see the story again and accepted it. He later told Lovecraft that the story was \\"violently disliked\\" by readers. Influence *The Silver Key was used as an artifact that caused people to see waking dreams of Lovecraft's creatures in a fourth-season episode of the mystery series Warehouse 13. *NeuroCreativa is creating a Lovecraftian video game titled The Silver Key. *In Jonathan L.

He is best known for his pedagogical innovations in the study of the Arabic language, as well as his translations of modern Arabic poets and novelists. Frangieh also lectures on the society and culture of the Arab world. A language professor as well as a scholar and writer, Frangieh has achieved moderate fame in the American academic world of Middle Eastern Studies for his engaging educational methods.  Education and career  Frangieh was born in a refugee camp in Lebanon in 1949. His family, Palestinians who had owned an orange grove in Yaffa, had been relocated there due to the conflicts associated with the creation of the state of Israel. His family is distantly related to the famous Frangieh family of Lebanon, including former Lebanese president Suleiman Frangieh, but the Palestinian Frangieh family tree diverged from the Lebanese family tree several generations ago. Frangieh eventually moved to Syria to attend university, earning a B.A. from Damascus University in 1976. While in Syria, he earned fame as a boxing champion and professional soccer player. Frangieh attended graduate school in the United States, and received a Ph.D. in Arabic literature from Georgetown University in 1987. After receiving his doctorate, Frangieh taught Arabic at Georgetown for several years before accepting a position at Yale University. After his resignation from Yale in 2007, Frangieh joined Claremont McKenna College as a full-time Arabic professor and the head of the Arabic Department for the five Claremont Colleges while writing and researching new Arabic books. He is the head of the Middle East Studies Department.  Controversies  In April 2010, a campus publication at the Claremont Colleges published statements Frangieh had made or signed onto supporting controversial organizations in Lebanon and Palestine. *During the 2006 Lebanon War, Frangieh signed a petition in support of \\"Lebanese resistance\\" organization Hezbollah. The petition referred to the Hezbollah cross-border raid that resulted in the capture and death of 3 Israeli soldiers as a \\"heroic operation.\\" The petition also urged \\"Arab intellectuals to stand beside the Lebanese Resistance\\" and to boycott the \\"Zionist killing machine.\\" * In 2007, Frangieh signed a petition calling a Senate resolution to divide Iraq a \\"Zionist plot,\\" led by \\"Zionist masters\\" who work with \\"Cowboys\\" and \\"flee their countries in search of riches,\\" thereby purposefully undermining a \\"strong Iraq\\" and dragging it into a \\"barbaric war.\\" * In Frangieh's 2000 essay \\"Modern Arabic Poetry: Vision and Reality,\\" Frangieh stated that \\"For real change to come about, thousands of people will have to die; thousands must martyr themselves. It appears that only massive revolution will succeed in overturning the corrupt regimes of the Arab world.\\" In the ensuing aftermath, Claremont McKenna Vice-President of Public Affairs and Communications Richard Rodner was accused of attempting to cover up Frangieh's past statements. Past statements Frangieh made were briefly deleted from his Wikipedia page by a user under the name \\"RRODNER.\\" The faculty at Frangieh's college decided to vote on whether to censure Frangieh for his past statements. Ultimately, Claremont McKenna College Faculty voted against censuring Frangieh.  Bibliography  Frangieh is a prolific author in both Arabic and English on contemporary Arabic literature.

In 1932, the Industrial Club of Chicago (organized in 1905) joined. Its most active members included George Pullman, Marshall Field, Cyrus McCormick, George Armour, Frederic Delano, Sewell Avery, Rufus C. Dawes, and Julius Rosenwald. The club promotes the economic development interests of its members. It championed member Daniel Burnham's Plan of Chicago (1909), also known as Burnham's plan. The plan gave the blueprint for the future growth and development of the entire Chicago region. The Commercial Club addressed many other progressive reform issues: supported street cleaning and paving projects, smoke abatement and sanitation schemes, and the development of city parks and playgrounds. They also endorsed the creation of the Cook County Forest Preserve district. They also maintained a consciousness of social reform issues like juvenile delinquency, race relations, and old-age pensions. The Civic Committee of the Commercial Club has often come under criticism for pursuing an unrealistic zeal for cutting the constitutionally protected pensions of state employees in Illinois. The club remains in existence today tracing its origins back to the 17 founding members of the Commercial Club in 1877. The current chairman is Frederick H. Waddell and the current president is Kelly R. Welsh. Former president Tyrone C.

He is best known for his invention, the Ward Leonard motor control system. Equipment based on this invention remained in service into the 21st century. Early life and heritage Harry Ward Leonard was born on February 8, 1861 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Ezra George Leonard and Henrietta Dana Ward. He was the fourth of their six children. He was a great great grandson of American Revolutionary War General Artemas Ward. In 1895, he was married to Carolyn Good in Geneva, Switzerland. As a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Leonard was instrumental in founding the student newspaper, The Tech, and served as the president of the paper‚Äôs board of directors. He graduated from MIT in 1883. Career After graduating from MIT, Leonard was employed by Thomas Edison to help introduce the Edison central-station electric power distribution system. Within four years, he was promoted to the position of general superintendent of the Western Electric Light Company of Chicago, Illinois. The following year, he established Leonard and Izard, a firm that set up electric railways and generating stations. In 1889, his firm was acquired by Edison and Leonard became the general manager of the Edison operations in the United States and Canada. In 1896, Leonard organized and became president of Ward Leonard Electric as an Edison company in Hoboken, New Jersey. In 1898, he left the Edison organization and incorporated his own Ward Leonard Electric Company on February 19, 1898 in the village of Bronxville in Westchester County, New York. While working for Edison, Leonard patented a number of inventions and he continued developing new ideas throughout his career. He was granted patents for more than 100 inventions of electrical distribution and control systems and related equipment. The Ward Leonard motor control system The Ward Leonard motor control system was Mr. Leonard‚Äôs best known and most lasting invention. It was introduced in about 1891 and soon became the most widely used type of electric motor speed control. In a Ward Leonard system, a prime mover drives a direct current (DC) generator at a constant speed. The armature of the DC generator is connected directly to the armature of a DC motor. The DC motor drives the load equipment at an adjustable speed. The motor speed is adjusted by adjusting the output voltage of the generator using a rheostat to adjust the excitation current in the field winding. The motor field current is usually not adjusted, but the motor field is sometimes reduced to increase the speed above the base speed. The prime mover is usually an alternating current (AC) motor, but a DC motor or an engine might be used instead. To provide the DC field excitation power supply, Ward Leonard systems usually include an exciter generator that is driven by the prime mover. Although only technical specialists are likely to be familiar with Ward Leonard systems, many millions of people have ridden in elevators powered by Ward Leonard drives. From the 1920s through the 1980s most electrically driven elevators used Ward Leonard control and many systems remained in use at the beginning of the 21st century. Many variations of the Ward Leonard system have been implemented, but they have generally continued to be called Ward Leonard systems. H. Ward Leonard and many others have patented auxiliary control systems used to regulate the motor speed as required to automatically perform specific tasks such as controlling pump speed to regulate flow. Mechanical types of adjustable-speed drives and other electrical types continued to be used and new types developed after the Ward Leonard system was introduced. Electron tube types of DC motor controls began to be developed in the 1920s but electronic controls didn‚Äôt seriously begin to displace the Ward Leonard system until thyristor controlled drives were developed in the late 1960s. By the mid-1970s, Ward Leonard drives were rapidly becoming obsolete, but the replacement of existing Ward Leonard drives has continued past the end of the 20th century. Sudden death H. Ward Leonard was an active member of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, publishing technical papers, attending meetings and making presentations. He died suddenly on February 18, 1915 in New York while attending the annual dinner of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.

This Wind River Range alpine glacier is associated with the largest grouping of glaciers in the U.S. Rocky Mountains and lies on the north slope of Fremont Peak, the third tallest mountain in Wyoming. Upper Fremont Glacier is at an average altitude of and is one of the highest altitude glaciers in the American Rockies. Ice core samples were taken from Upper Fremont Glacier in 1990-1991. These ice cores were analyzed for climatic changes as well as alterations of atmospheric chemicals. In 1998 an unbroken ice core sample of was taken from the glacier and subsequent analysis of the ice showed an abrupt change in the oxygen isotope ratio oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in conjunction with what is widely regarded as the end of the Little Ice Age, a period of cooler global temperatures between the years 1550 and 1850. A linkage was established with a similar ice core study which had been undertaken on the Quelccaya Ice Cap in Peru, which also demonstrated the same changes in the oxygen isotope ratio during the same period. The climatic implications from the ice cores taken from both sites support evidence of a sudden global climate change during the mid 19th century. 36Cl from 1960s nuclear testing. Amount of atmospheric mercury deposited at Wyoming's Upper Fremont Glacier over the last 270 years Ice cores from the glacier also showed increased levels of Tritium (3H) and chlorine-36 around the year 1963, which coincides with the peak period of above ground nuclear testing. The same ice cores were also tested for Mercury deposition from natural and human-induced activities. This is the first known instance in which ice cores have been used to determine Mercury deposition from a mid-latitude glacier in North America, as all previous studies have been derived from other sources. The majority of Mercury deposition is by way of the atmosphere and sources of the element may be from volcanic activity or from industrialization, but volcanoes contribute a small proportion of the Mercury. The ice core samples from the Upper Fremont Glacier indicated that levels of Mercury increased dramatically during the industrial revolution and have decreased significantly since the mid-1980s. It is believed that the decrease in Mercury deposition since the 1980s coincides with the passage of the Clean Air Act.

Other In 1990, Australian actor Rob Inglis read/performed an unabridged version for Recorded Books in their New York studio. While not strictly a dramatisation, Inglis created voices for all of the characters. And along with project producer Claudia Howard, he created music for all of the songs, which he performed. The project took six weeks to record, plus preparation time. A year later he recorded an audio version of The Hobbit. Dramatisations In 1955 and 1956, the BBC broadcast The Lord of the Rings, a 12-part radio adaptation of the story. Tolkien disparaged this dramatisation, referring to the portrayal of Tom Bombadil as \\"dreadful\\" and complaining bitterly about several other aspects. In the early 1960s radio station WBAI-FM, New York, broadcast a short adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, with music. This version, not authorized by Tolkien, was later suppressed by his legal representatives. A 1979 dramatization of The Lord of the Rings was broadcast in the United States. The series was produced by The Mind's Eye, a small theater company that specialized in audio adaptations of popular works, and which also produced a six-hour adaptation of The Hobbit. In 1981 the BBC broadcast The Lord of the Rings, an ambitious dramatisation in 26 half-hour instalments. It starred Ian Holm as Frodo Baggins, Bill Nighy as Sam Gamgee, and Michael Hordern as Gandalf. In 1992 the German radio stations SDR and WDR broadcast Der Herr der Ringe, a 30-episode adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. In 1999-2000 the Danish radio station Danmarks Radio broadcast Eventyret om Ringen, a Danish language retelling of The Lord of the Rings by Rune T. Kidde. The music was by The Tolkien Ensemble, Hedningarna, Sorten Muld and Kim Skovbye.http://www.imladris.dk/?id=11&show;=95 In 2001, 2002 and 2003, the three volumes of the Lord of the Rings were adapted into three annual series of fully cast radio plays. Each series consisted of six episodes. The character of Bilbo Baggins served as the narrator. The eighteen episodes were produced and broadcast as a co-production between the public broadcaster Slovak Radio (now Radio and Television Slovakia) and the private broadcaster R√°dio Twist (later known as R√°dio Viva).

P. Lovecraft and E. Hoffmann Price between October 1932 and April 1933. A sequel to Lovecraft's \\"The Silver Key\\", and part of a sequence of stories focusing on Randolph Carter, it was first published in the July 1934 issue of Weird Tales. Plot At a gathering to decide the fate of Randolph Carter's estate (which has been held in trust since his disappearance) the mysterious Swami Chandraputra, who wears curious mittens and enveloping robes, tells Carter's acquaintances of his ultimate fate. He explains that the key took Carter to a type of higher dimension. There, Carter, on an ill-defined mission (or out of sheer curiosity), travelled strange sections of the cosmos by first meeting with 'Umr at-Tawil, a dangerous being warned of in the Necronomicon, saying those who deal with it never return. 'Umr at-Tawil offers Carter a chance to plunge deeper into the cosmos; Carter thus perceives the true nature of the universe before passing through the \\"Ultimate Gate.\\" After passing through the Ultimate Gate, Carter (now reduced to a disembodied facet of himself) encounters an Entity, implied to be Yog-Sothoth itself. This being explains that all conscious beings are facets of much greater beings, which exist outside the traditional model of three dimensions. Carter himself, and indeed all of the infinite Space-Time continuums, is a facet of this particular being, the Supreme Archetype, made up of the greatest thinkers of the universe. The Entity, appearing to be proud of Carter's accomplishments, offers to grant him a wish relating to the many facets of which it is a part. Carter explains that he would love to know more about the facets of a particular long-extinct race on a distant planet, Yaddith, which is constantly threatened by the monstrous Dholes. He has been having persistent dreams about Yaddith in the last few months. The Supreme Archetype accomplishes this by transferring Carter's consciousness into the body of one of his facets among that race, that of Zkauba the wizard, though not before warning Carter to have memorized all his symbols and rites. Carter arrogantly believes that the Silver Key alone will accomplish this claim, but it soon transpires Carter's wish was a mistake; he cannot escape, and is trapped in Zkauba's body. The two beings find each other repugnant, but are now trapped in the same body, periodically changing dominance. After a vast amount of time trapped on Yaddith, Carter finds a means of suppressing the alien mind with drugs, and then uses their technology, along with the Silver Key to return both to the present and to Earth, where Carter can retrieve his manuscript with the symbols he needs to work on regaining his original body. Once there, the Swami reports, Carter did find the manuscript and promptly contacted Swami Chandraputra, instructing him to go to the meeting to say he would soon be along to reclaim his estate and to continue to hold it in trust. After the Swami finishes the tale, one in the party, the lawyer Aspinwall (who is Carter's cousin), accuses Swami Chandraputra of telling a false tale in an attempt to steal the estate, claiming that he is some kind of conman in a disguise. As Aspinwall tears at the Swami's masklike face and beard, it is revealed that the Swami is not human at all, but Carter, still trapped in Zkauba's hideous body. The other witnesses don't see Carter/Zkauba's true face, but Aspinwall suffers a fatal heart attack. The crisis causes Zkauba's mind to reassert itself, and the alien wizard enters a curious, coffin-shaped clock (implied to be Carter/Zkauba's means of transport to Earth) and disappears. The tale ends with a vague postscript, speculating that the Swami was merely a common criminal who hypnotized the others to escape. However, the postscript notes, some of the story's details seem eerily accurate. Inspiration The story has its origins in Price's enthusiasm for an earlier Lovecraft tale. \\"One of my favorite HPL stories was, and still is, 'The Silver Key',\\" Price wrote in a 1944 memoir. \\"In telling him of the pleasure I had had in rereading it, I suggested a sequel to account for [protagonist] Randolph Carter's doings after his disappearance.\\"E. Hoffman Price, The Acolyte, 1944; cited in Carter, p. 93. After convincing an apparently reluctant Lovecraft to agree to collaborate on such a sequel, Price wrote a 6,000-word draft in August 1932; in April 1933, Lovecraft produced a 14,000-word version that left unchanged, by Price's estimate, \\"fewer than fifty of my original words,\\"Carter, p. 93. though An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia reports that Lovecraft \\"kept as many of Price's conceptions as possible, as well as some of his language.\\" Thus many of the central ideas of the story like 'Umr at-Tawil, the talk of mathematical planes and multiple facets of Randolph Carter throughout Time and Space come from Price, who was well read in neoplatonic thought, theosophy and the occult. Even the quote from the Necronomicon is mainly by Price in outline though put in more Lovecraftian language. The sub- plot about Yaddith was entirely Lovecraft's idea however. Hoffman Price's tales were oriental, and 'Umr at-Tawil was merely an Arab who had preternaturally long life in his draft. In any case, Price was pleased with the result, writing that Lovecraft \\"was right of course in discarding all but the basic outline. I could only marvel that he had made so much of my inadequate and bungling start.\\"Carter, p. 94. The story appeared under both authors' bylines in the July 1934 issue of Weird Tales; Price's draft was published as \\"The Lord of Illusion\\" in Crypt of Cthulhu No. 10 in 1982. Edward Guimont has proposed that an influence was Jack London's 1915 novel The Star Rover, which Lovecraft owned.Edward Guimont, \\"An Arctic Mystery: The Lovecraftian North Pole\\", in Lovecraft Annual 14, ed. S. T. Joshi (New York: Hippocampus Press, 2020), 156-57. Reception Lovecraft scholar Will Murray says of \\"Through the Gates of the Silver Key\\", \\"As a Dunsanian fantasy, the Price/Lovecraft collaboration is a failure; as a Mythos story, it is rich with ideas, but curiously diluted.\\"Will Murray, \\"Tentacles in Dreamland: Cthulhu Mythos Elements in the Dunsanian Stories\\", Black Forbidden Things, p. 32. In A Thousand Plateaus (1980), Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari called the story one of Lovecraft's masterpieces.Deleuze, Gilles & Guattari, F√©lix (translated by Brian Massumi).

He studied Dutch literature in Leiden and was promoted with a thesis on the author Aart van der Leeuw. In 1953, he was appointed to the Ministerie van Cultuur, Recreatie en Maatschappelijk werk, in charge of the art department. In 1959, he became general director in charge of culture at large (directeur-generaal voor culturele zaken). The establishment of the Vincent van Gogh Foundation and the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam were among his major tasks. From the 1950s, Hulsker contributed to Van Gogh research, concentrating on the dating of Van Gogh's correspondence. In 1973, Hulsker's most important study was published, Van Gogh door Van Gogh, which has not been translated from the Dutch. He is the author of an acknowledged catalogue raisonn√© of Van Gogh's work, published in 1978, revised in 1989 and again in 1996.

In the late 2000s, his appearances in various gay pornography movies led him to become a popular Internet meme on video sharing websites such as Japan's Nico Nico Douga, where he was referred to by the sobriquet . Since then, at least 110,000 short mash-up parodies of his clips ‚Äî known as \\"Gachimuchi\\" ‚Äî have been produced by fans. Early life and career Herrington was born in North Babylon, New York. Herrington grew up in Long Island learning karate from his father, a sensei. He had interests in boxing, wrestling and martial arts, but did not start bodybuilding until he was 24 years old, after moving to New York City. Herrington began his erotic career when his then girlfriend surreptitiously submitted his nude pictures to Playgirl magazine. The photographs won him a \\"Real Men of the Month\\" contest and a $500 prize. His appearance in the magazine caught the eye of famed photographer Jim French, but it was two years before Herrington posed for his first Colt calendars for French. Soon after, Herrington was filming hardcore gay adult films for All Worlds Video, and appearing on mainstream TV programs such as Love Connection and the Ricki Lake talk show. In 2002, Herrington said the adult film industry helped him to understand his bisexuality. In 2016, he responded to a Twitter comment identifying him as homosexual by stating that he was straight. Among his starring roles is the Roman emperor in the Danish feature film HotMen CoolBoyz (2000). Herrington's scene in Conquered (2001) with Nino Bacci, Colton Ford, Blake Harper, and Jay Ross won the \\"Best Group Sex Scene\\" at the 2002 Adult Erotic Gay Video Awards (\\"Grabbys\\"). Occasionally, Herrington performed striptease acts at gay clubs in the United States.  Internet meme  Herrington gained fame in Japan as an Internet meme, after a clip from one of his videos Workout was posted on Niconico, a Japanese video sharing website. Thousands of mash-up parody videos of him have been made, many of which utilize deliberate mishearings (soramimi) of lines from his films. He is affectionately called among the Nico Nico Douga community, and most of his videos are deliberately mistagged with , , , or all three.Billy Herrington on Nico Nico Douga In February 2009, Herrington visited Japan to attend a live online event hosted by Niconico and garage kit maker Good Smile Company.

As of December, 2014, the Church drew 6,000 Christians to weekly worship services on multiple campuses, including new sites in Chicago, Illinois and Cairo, Egypt. History In 2002, approximately 100 remaining members of Gracemont Baptist Church in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, a suburb of Tulsa, asked Dr. Alex Himaya to accept a position as Senior Pastor and to help revitalize the church. Due to a series of events, the Gracemont congregation had experienced a serious decline in membership. At the time the remaining members of the congregation found themselves in possession of a large meeting space (originally built as an Outlet mall but acquired by Gracemont during a period of growth in the 1980s) and an equally large mortgage. Pastor Himaya was reared in Louisiana, the child of an Egyptian father and North Carolina born mother. He was called to Battle Creek from a church in Arkansas ion 2002. Church members planned to make 11 fellowship visits to churches in Egypt in 2015. Dr. Himaya agreed to accept the position with the understanding that the church would essentially dissolve and reorganize as a new congregation with a new name, new ministry efforts, and a strong emphasis on evangelism. Dr. Himaya set the direction for the church during an initial meeting when he stated: \\"Tulsa does not need another church. What Tulsa does need is a safe environment where the unchurched can come and hear the life-changing truth that Jesus Christ cares for them and died for their sin.\\" Soon after, the congregation incorporated as \\"The Church at BattleCreek.\\" Broken Arrow continues to be the largest campus of the rapidly growing Church, described as one of the fastest-growing churches in the country. The Church at BattleCreek held its initial public service on August 14, 2003. As of the church's third anniversary in August 2006, it was reporting weekly attendance at two Sunday morning services of over 1600 people, including over 700 children and teenagers. The church had also retired its mortgage debt and the staff of the church had expanded to include five full-time pastors, and several other full and part-time employees. Additionally, The Church at BattleCreek was operating a daily preschool and providing meeting space and financial support to Christian congregations for Arabic and Spanish speaking people in the Tulsa Metropolitan Area. In 2007, the church began construction of a 1,200-seat auditorium with state-of-the-art audio-visual capabilities. In 2014, Immanuel Baptist Church, located at the eastern edge of downtown Tulsa, joined the Church at Battle Creek as a satellite congregation. With the addition, the church had four sites, three in the Tulsa area and one in Wheaton, Illinois. In 2015 the Church faced neighborhood opposition to a plan to expand its Midtown, Tulsa, campus. Affiliation The Church at BattleCreek is part of the Southern Baptist Convention. However, in general, The Church at BattleCreek employs more of a non-denominational approach and does not necessarily emphasize its Baptist affiliation. Gracemont Baptist Church purchased the Outlet Mall in 1991.

Created in 1984, the medal is intended to recognize individuals‚Äîboth Canadian and foreign‚Äîwho have carried out meritorious acts bringing benefit and honour in either of two categories: military and civilian. Design The Meritorious Service Cross, for both divisions, is in the form of a Greek cross with the arms 38 mm across, the ends splayed and rounded, a laurel wreath visible between them, and a St. Edward's Crown, as a symbol of the Canadian monarch's role as the fount of honour, capping the top arm. At the cross' centre, on the obverse, is a roundel bearing a maple leaf, and on the reverse are two concentric circles, the inner one containing an etched Royal Cypher of the reigning monarch, and the outer one engraved with the words MERITORIOUS SERVICE M√âRITOIRE. This medallion is worn on the left chest, on a 32 mm wide, blue and white ribbon; however, that for the military division has only two white stripes, each 6 mm wide and centred on the outer third of each side of the ribbon, while that for the civilian division has an additional 1 mm wide white stripe centred between the other two. For men, the cross is hung from a bar, and for women, on a ribbon bow, both pinned to the left chest. Should an individual already possessing a Meritorious Service Cross be awarded the medal again, he or she is granted a medal bar, in silver and bearing a central maple leaf, for wear on the ribbon from which the original medal is suspended. Eligibility and receipt On 11 June 1984, Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of her Cabinet under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, created the Meritorious Service Cross to recognize highly professional acts that are of considerable benefit to the Canadian Forces; the civilian division was then added on 6 June 1991 (though applicable retroactively to 1984), honouring similar acts‚Äîwhether in athletics, diplomatic relations, humanitarian activities, etc.‚Äîthat benefit the nation. Any person, living or deceased, may be nominated for the medal: the military division is awarded to members of the Canadian Forces, or of any foreign military allied with Canada, and nominations come from commanding officers; the civilian division is open to both Canadians and foreigners, and nominations may be submitted by any person. In all cases, however, the event being recognized must have taken place in Canada or involved Canadian citizens. An award enables recipients to use the post-nominal letters MSC (in French: CSM). As of March 2020, the Meritorious Service Cross has been presented to 410 people; 224 have been awarded in the military division and 187 in the civilian, with Chris Hadfield having been awarded one in each category.

A longtime resident of Seattle, Washington, Sayre was an influential figure in writing and conserving the history of theatre in the city. Personal life James Willis Sayre was born in Washington, D.C. His father, James Mathew Sayre, served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. His mother, Maria Burrows Sayre, was a field nurse for the Confederacy. The Sayre family relocated to the Pacific Northwest sometime around 1890. At the turn of the century, Sayre left Seattle to fight in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in the Philippines. After his return, he lobbied local officials to rename City Park, located on Capitol Hill, to Volunteer Park to honor the volunteers of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. A 1901 ordinance changed the name. Emulating Jules Verne's Phileas Fogg, in 1903 he set the world record for circling the earth using public transportation exclusively, completing his trip in 54 days 9 hours and 42 minutes. Sayre married Pearl Myrtle Shakelford Sayre (January 4, 1884 ‚Äì May 23, 1978) in 1904. They had one child, Elinore Pearl Sayre (January 21, 1906 ‚Äì September 12, 1992), who was born in Seattle, King County. Sayre lived in Seattle until 1959, when he moved to Santa Cruz, California due to failing health. He died at the age of 86. Professional career Sayre's involvement with the theatre began around 1891 when he took a job at the Seattle Opera House folding programs. In 1899, Sayre began working as an advertising director for theater manager John Cort and soon opened Seattle's first theatrical advertising agency. In late 1907, he began his career as a theatrical critic with one of Seattle‚Äôs weekly papers, The Argus. He worked briefly for the Seattle Star in 1909, then returned to the Seattle Daily Times, where he edited the paper‚Äôs theatrical department and wrote reviews. He worked as the manager of the Seattle Symphony from 1908 to 1909. From 1924 to 1936 he worked as an independent promoter of theatre productions and films and wrote several books on the history of Seattle. One of these books, This City of Ours, was a standard history text in Seattle public schools for many years. In 1936, he joined the staff of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, where he eventually managed the theatrical department. He retired from this position in 1954 after suffering a small stroke. Over the course of his career, Sayre worked as a theatrical critic and editor for several of the local newspapers and magazines and is known to have handled publicity and advertising for a variety of Seattle theaters including the Grand Opera House, Seattle Theatre, Lyceum, Palm Garden, Second Avenue Orpheum, Star, Alhambra, Majestic, Mission, Liberty, 5th Avenue Theatre, Coliseum, Rex, Strand, Pantages, Blue Mouse, and Music Box Theatres. On several occasions, Sayre‚Äôs role as an arts promoter and theatrical critic became blurred. For example, while he was the manager of the Seattle Symphony he was also writing for various Seattle newspapers and reviewing Symphony performances. This apparent conflict of interest was not controversial at the time. Sayre compiled a vast collection of publicity photographs from theatrical performers, dramatic companies, musicians, and traveling shows that played in Seattle as well as theater and musical programs. This collection is housed at the University of Washington Libraries Special Collection Division. Works * Sayre, J. Willis, The Romance of Second Avenue, Seattle: J. Willis Sayre, 1933. * Sayre, J.

He was born in 1904 in Tokyo, the youngest son of Baron Dan Takuma, president of the Mitsui Gomei Kaisha Corporation. Takuma Dan was educated in the United States, graduating from MIT in 1878. He was one of the first foreign students to be educated at MIT and later, as president of the Japan Steel Works, he initiated and maintained close research ties with The Institute. After receiving his undergraduate degree in Japan, Katsuma Dan also came to the United States where he studied embryology with Prof. L.V. Heilbrunn at the University of Pennsylvania. In addition Dan worked and studied at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole (MBL) from 1931 to 1934, and later in 1936. It was here that he met his future wife (and longtime scientific collaborator) Jean M. Clark (1910‚Äì1978). Clark, who was also a student of Heilbrunn's, studied fertilization in marine invertebrates. The couple raised five children. They also maintained lasting ties to the MBL and returned often in later years as summer researchers and lecturers in embryology. In March 1932, while Dan was studying at the MBL, his father was assassinated in Japan by ultra-nationalist radicals in the 'League of Blood Incident'. Katsuma Dan returned to Japan in the late 1930s and worked at the Misaki Marine Biological Station in Morioso Bay. He and his students maintained a remarkable degree of scientific productivity during World War II. His spirit is reflected in a letter written after the war to a friend in the United States: ‚Äú...ducking under bombs was not so bad. Rather it was a great excitement. Hide and seek at the expense of your life can't help being exciting. There was, however, an awful side to it too.‚Äù Near the end of the war the Japanese Navy took over the Misaki Marine Station and converted it into a base for miniature submarines. Although displaced, Dan and his students set up a crude laboratory nearby and continued their work. At the end of the war Dan posted a hand-written note on the door of Misaki, addressed to advancing America forces, in which he said: ‚Äú... you can destroy the weapons and the war instruments but save the civil equipments [sic] for the Japanese students. When you are through with your job here notify to the university [sic] and let us come back to our scientific home.‚Äù The note was signed, ‚ÄúThe last one to go.‚Äù The obvious humanity and the mention of American marine biological laboratories appealed to a US Naval officer who passed the note on to the MBL. It was later published in Time Magazine under the headline, ‚ÄúAppeal to the Goths‚Äù. Dan's scientific work focused on using marine invertebrates as model organisms to study fundamental questions in cell biology and embryonic development. He and his students focused on direct observation of cell behavior using light microscopy and discovered many of the fundamental aspects of fertilization, development, and morphogenesis (e.g., Dan and Okazaki, 1956). To settle a long-standing debate over the existence of the mitotic spindle, he encouraged his student, Shinya Inoue, to construct polarized light microscopes and look for evidence of organized polymer networks in living cells. And, together with Daniel Mazia, he was the first to isolate the mitotic apparatus and subject it to biochemical study. This work demonstrated conclusively the existence of the mitotic spindle and initiated the modern biochemical study of mitosis. Dan and his students also developed methods for measuring small, local movements of the cell surface during division. This enabled detailed, quantitative studies of the process of cell cleavage (cytokinesis). Based on this work, Dan proposed the novel idea that cell cleavage is driven directly by elongation of the mitotic spindle. That is, the spindle itself attaches to the cell surface via 'astral rays' (microtubules) and physically draws in the cleavage furrow (Dan, 1943). Subsequent work indicated that cleavage is actually driven by contraction of an actin filament network in the cortex rather than by expansion of the spindle but this idea was the forerunner of the current view of cytokinesis, in which interaction of spindle microtubules with the cell cortex determines the position of the cleavage furrow. Katsuma Dan was professor of zoology at the Tokyo Metropolitan University from 1949-1968. He also served as president of the university from 1964 until his retirement in 1972. Dan was president of both the Zoological Society of Japan and the Japanese Society of Developmental biologists. In 1976 he received the Second Order Imperial Medal, and in 1987 he received the Emperor's Award for Cultural Merit. A fellowship honoring Katsuma and Jean Clark Dan was established in 1979 for cultural exchange between the United States and Japan. Katsuma Dan died in 1996 in Osaka, Japan, at the age of 91.

For example, when operating a vehicle, gasoline, parking fees and tolls are considered out-of-pocket expenses for a trip. Car insurance, oil changes, and interest are not, since the outlay of cash covers expenses accrued over a longer period of time. The services rendered and other in-kind expenses are not considered out-of-pocket expenses; the same goes for depreciation of capital goods or depletion. Organizations often reimburse out-of-pocket expenses incurred on their behalf, especially expenses incurred by employees on their employers' behalf. In the United States, out-of-pocket expenses for such things as charity, medical bills, and education may be deductions on US income taxes, according to IRS regulations. To be out of pocket is to have expended personal resources, often unexpectedly or unfairly, at the end of some enterprise. Health financing In the health care financing sector, this represents the share of the expenses that the insured party must pay directly to the health care provider, without a third-party (insurer, or government). United States Out-of-pocket costs are high especially when it comes to prescription drugs in the United States. Before investing in a health care plan, it is very useful to examine the out-of-pocket prescription costs as they may be very low or very high. High out-of-pocket costs may correlate with lower prescription adherence and more importation of medications from foreign countries. Medicare Part D is a federal program aimed at lowering prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries. However, after the first year of Medicare Part D, out-of-pocket drug costs were down, but there was not a noticeable reduction in emergency department visits, hospitalization, or health utility score. Perhaps, some diseases will be more sensitive to Medicare Part D.The Impact Of Medicare Part D On Prescription Drug Use By The Elderly. Content.healthaffairs.org. Retrieved on 2011-04-17. Australia A recent study published from Australia shows that the out-of-pocket cost burden falls most heavily on patients who are least able to bear it, both in terms of their health and in terms of their income. Among the respondents 14% experienced a heavy financial burden. Medication and medical service expenses were the major costs. This study concluded that despite Australia's universal health coverage (medicare) a substantial portion of senior citizens suffer from excessive out-of-pocket expenditure, and this burden increases with increasing number of chronic conditions. Among the specific conditions, those who experienced cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes or depression were likely to report higher out-of-pocket expenditure. Some ways to improve physician knowledge of drug costs were thought to be increased physician- patient communication or higher use of information technology. Physicians with high rates of IT use did not have significantly higher knowledge or drug costs. Health IT design should be improved to make it easier for physicians to access cost information at the point of care.

Issues include desertification, problems with access to safe water supply, population explosion and fauna depletion. These issues are ultimately linked to over-population in Africa, as well as on a global scale. Nearly all of Africa's environmental problems are geographically variable and human induced, though not necessarily by Africans. Deforestation The large scale felling of trees and the resulting decreases in forest areas are the main environmental issues of the African Continent. Rampant clearing of forests and land conversion goes on for agriculture, settlement and fuel needs. Ninety percent of Africa's population requires wood to use as fuel for heating and cooking. As a result, forested areas are decreasing daily, as for example, in the region of equatorial evergreen forests. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, Africa's desertification rate is twice that of the world's. The rate of illegal logging, which is another main cause of deforestation, varies from country to country, such as 50% in Cameroon and 80% in Liberia. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, deforestation is primarily caused by the needs of the poor citizens, along with unsupervised logging and mining. In Ethiopia, the main cause is the country's growing population, which induces an increase in agriculture, livestock production, and fuel wood. Low education and little government intervention also contributes to deforestation. Madagascar's forest loss is partially caused by citizens using slash-and-burn techniques after independence from the French. Nigeria has the highest rate of deforestation of primary forests, according to the gfy. Deforestation in Nigeria is caused by logging, subsistence agriculture, and the collection of wood for fuel. According to the gfy, deforestation has wiped out nearly 90% of Africa's forest. West Africa only has 22.8% of its moist forests left, and 81% of Nigeria's old-growth forests disappeared within 15 years. Deforestation also lowers the chance of rainfall; Ethiopia has experienced famine and droughts because of this. 98% of Ethiopia's forests have disappeared over the last 50 years. Within 43 years, Kenya's forest coverage decreased from about 10% to 1.7%. Deforestation in Madagascar has also led to desertification, soil loss, and water source degradation, resulting in the country's inability to provide necessary resources for its growing population. In the last five years, Nigeria lost nearly half of its primary forests. Ethiopia's government, along with organizations like Farm Africa, is starting to take steps to stop excessive deforestation. Deforestation is an issue, and forests are important in Africa, as populations have relied heavily on them to provide basic needs. Woods are used for shelter, clothing, agricultural elements, and much more. Woodland supplies are also used to create medicines and a wide variety of food. Some of these foods include fruits, nuts, honey, and much more. Wood is crucial for economic gain in Africa, especially in developing countries. Forests also help the environment. It is estimated that the green belt of Africa contains over 1.5 million species. Without the forest habitat to protect the species, the populations are at risk. The livelihoods of millions of people and species are at risk with deforestation. The act is a domino effect that affects multiple aspects of a community, ecosystem, and economy.Hillstrom & Hillstrom The Worlds environments. a continental overview of environmental issues 2003 pg. 85-86 Many African nations have begun to implement restoration projects in order to reverse the effects of deforestation. These projects have been shown to improve the environment in many ways and the livelihood of the people living near them. For example \\"Reforestation and agroforestry schemes can help, for instance, to sequester carbon, prevent flooding, enhance biodiversity, rehabilitate degraded lands, provide a local energy supply for the rural poor and improve land use and watershed management.\\" Soil degradation The erosion caused by rains, rivers and winds as well as over- utilization of soils for agriculture and low use of manures have resulted in turning the soils infertile, as for example, in the plains of the Nile and the Orange River. A main cause of soil degradation is lack of manufactured fertilizers being used, since African soil lacks organic sources of nutrients. The increase in population has also contributed when people need to crop, as a source of income, but do not take measures to protect the soil, due to low income. The current methods create too much pressure on other environmental aspects, such as forests, and are not sustainable. There are also ecological causes of the poor soil quality. Much of the soil has rocks or clay from volcanic activity. Other causes include erosion, desertification, and deforestation. Degradation of African soil causes decreased food production, damaging ecological effects, and an overall decrease in the quality of living in Africa. This issue would lessen if fertilizers and other cropping supplies were more affordable and thus used more. The United Nations has commissioned a Global Assessment of Human Induced Soil Degradation (GLASOD) to further investigate the causes and state of the soil. Access to information collected is freely available, and it is hoped that awareness will be raised among politicians in threatened areas. Air pollution The air in Africa is greatly polluted due to multiple reasons stated below. The primitive method of farming that takes place in most areas in Africa is certainly a causal factor. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 11.3 million hectares of land are being lost annually to agriculture, grazing, uncontrolled burning and fuelwood consumption.Lanly, J.P. (1982) Tropical Forest Resources. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Rome, Italy: United Nations. Retrieved from http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/an778e/an778e00.pdf Combustion of wood and charcoal are used for cooking and this results to a release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is a toxic pollutant in the atmosphere. Also, due to the poor supply of power, most homes have to rely on fuel and diesel in generators to keep their electricity running.World Health Organization (2013). Regional burden of disease due to indoor air pollution. Retrieved from http://www.who.int/indoorair/health_impacts/burden_regional/en/ Air pollution in Africa is coming to the forefront and must not be ignored. For example, in South Africa the mercury levels are severe due to coal combustion and gold mining. Mercury is absorbed from the air into the soil and water. The soil allows the crops to absorb the mercury, which humans ingest. Animals eat the grass which has absorbed the mercury and again humans may ingest these animals. Fish absorb the mercury from the water, humans also ingest the fish and drink the water that have absorbed the mercury. This increases the mercury levels in humans. This can cause serious health risks. It is expected that Africa could represent the half of the world's pollution emissions by 2030, warns Cathy Liousse director of research of atmospheric sounding of the CNRS, along with many other researchers. According to the report, sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing a fast increasing pollution, derived from many causes, such as burning wood for cooking, open burning of waste, traffic, agri-food and chemical industries, the dust from the Sahara carried by the winds through the Sahel area, all this reinforced by a greater population growth and urbanisation. The World Health Organization reports of the need to intervene when more than one third of the total Disability Adjusted Life YearsWorld Health Organization (2013). Mental Health - DALYs/YLDs definition. Retrieved from http://www.who.int/mental_health/management/depression/daly/en/ was lost as a result of exposure to indoor air pollution in Africa. Fuel is needed to power lights at night. The fuel being burned causes great emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Because of the increased Urbanization in Africa, people are burning more and more fuel and using more vehicles for transportation. The rise in vehicle emissions and the trend towards greater industrialization means the urban air quality in the continent is worsening. In many countries, the use of leaded gasoline is still widespread, and vehicle emission controls are nonexistent. Indoor air pollution is widespread, mostly from the burning of coal in the kitchen for cooking. Compounds released from fuel stations and nitrogen and hydrocarbon released from airports cause air pollution. Carbon dioxide other greenhouse gases in the air causes an increase of people with respiratory issues. There is a common relationship between air pollution and population. Africa widely diverse between areas that are overpopulated versus areas that are scarcely populated. In regions where there is little industrial development and few people, air quality is high. Vice versa, in densely populated and industrialized regions the air quality is low. Addressing the air pollution in big cities is often a big priority, even though the continent as a whole produces little air pollutants by international standards. Even so, air pollutants are causing a variety of health and environmental problems. These pollutants are a threat to the population of Africa and the environment they try so hard to sustain.Hillstrom & Hillstrom The Worlds environments. a continental overview of environmental issues 2003 pp. 207‚Äì208  Climate change See also *African Environment (bulletin) *Africover (UN project) *Global issues *AFR100 References *Hillstrom, Kevin, and Laurie Collier Hillstrom.

(Jack) Frazer OMM, MSC (December 20, 1931 ‚Äì December 17, 2012) was a member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1993 to 1997. He was born in Kamloops, British Columbia In 1956, he married the former Millicent June Black. Assigned to Fighter Controller duties in 1958, after completing the Fighter Controller course at Tyndal Air force Base, Florida, Frazer served at Radar Stations, Mont Apica, Quebec and Edgar Ontario before being selected to join the RCAF Golden Hawks aerobatic team at RCAF Chatham in 1961. Flying with the Golden Hawks in 1961 and 1962, he flew in air shows across Canada and the United States before being selected to fly the CF104 Starfighter. After completing the Starfighter course at Cold Lake, Alberta, he was posted to RCAF Marville, France where he formed and commanded 439 Reconnaissance Squadron on the CF104 at RCAF #1 Wing Marville, France from 1964 to 1967. #1 Reconnaissance Wing Marville achieved a first when they earned a #1 rating on their first NATO Tactical Evaluation, a performance never achieved before or repeated since. When Charles DeGaulle ordered NATO out of France and #1 Wing was to take over French Air Force Station Lahr, Germany, Frazer was named Commander of the Advance Party at Lahr and later returned to Marville as Commander of the Rear Party, closing the Station there. Having completed the closure of Marville, Frazer returned to his duties as Deputy Operations Officer at RCAF Lahr which, despite the move again earned a #1 rating on the subsequent NATO Tactical Evaluation. In 1968 Major Frazer moved to Canadian Forces Headquarters in Ottawa as Secretary to the Director General Force Objectives. The following year he was posted to Toronto to attend the RCAF Staff College. In 1970, he was posted to NATO Headquarters Allied Forces Northern Europe (HQ AFNORTH) at Kolsas, Norway as the Staff Officer Reconnaissance. in 1973 he returned to CFB Chilliwack, B.C. as a Company Commander in the Canadian Forces Officer Candidate School and in 1974 was promoted Lieutenant Colonel to command the school. In 1976, he was assigned as Base Operations Officer at CFB Cold Lake Alberta where he oversaw flying operations there and was responsible for instituting the first Operation Maple Flag the multi-national exercise simulating an air war environment, which continues today. Posted to 25 NORAD Region Headquarters at Mchord Air Force Base, Tacoma Washington in 1979, Frazer assumed his duties as Assistant Deputy for Operations. A year later he was promoted Colonel and assigned as Base Commander and Deputy Commander #1 Canadian Air Group at CFB Baden Soellingen, Germany. In 1983 Frazer was posted to Harare, Zimbabwe where, as Military Advisor/Attache, he was accredited to Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Botswana. In 1985 while on a routine visit to Uganda a Coup d'√âtat occurred deposing Milton Obote as president and creating chaos with extensive killing and looting. After remaining in his hotel for four days, Frazer effected liaison with the British High Commission in Kampala and assisted in organizing the evacuation of the citizens of ten western nations from Uganda to Kenya. For his actions in this organization dealing with a number of potentially dangerous situations during the evacuation, Colonel Frazer was awarded the Meritorious Service Cross. In 1986 Frazer and his wife returned to Canada where he built his home and retired on Salt Spring Island BC. Joining the Reform Party of Canada in 1988, Frazer was elected Saanich-Gulf Islands Reform Party of Canada Candidate for Parliament in 1993 and was elected Member Of Parliament for Saanich-Gulf Islands in the October election that year. He served as Defence and Veterans Affairs Critic and Deputy Whip and sat on seven Parliamentary Committees during the 35th Parliament. His Private Members Bill establishing the Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal (CPSM) was passed into law on 5 April 1997. After serving in the 35th Canadian Parliament, Frazer did not seek a second term in Parliament. After the 1997 election when he left politics, Frazer was appointed to the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, operated by the federal government's Veterans Affairs Canada.

Talkin' to Myself: Blues Lyrics, 1921‚Äì1942. New York: Routledge. p. 213. . was an American blues musician and nurse from Jefferson County, Georgia. She is known primarily as the former wife of the blues musician Blind Willie McTell, whom she accompanied vocally on several recordings. She may have recorded as Ruby Glaze, but there is some uncertainty about whether she and Glaze were the same person, despite the fact that she claimed to be Glaze. Early life and marriage to Blind Willie McTell Ruthy (later changed to Ruth) Kate Williams was born in Savannah, Georgia. She was singing for a high-school ceremony in Augusta, Georgia, in 1933 when she was noticed by McTell, who regularly performed in the area. In an interview conducted by the musicologist David Evans and his family, she stated that she and Willie met at a Christmas concert at her school in 1931.Gray (2007). p. 230. She went on to explain that Willie invited her to record with him, that they did so in Atlanta over the course of a week, and that she then returned to Augusta to continue her schooling at Paine College. According to Michael Gray, that week of recording would have been in February 1932. The McTells were married on January 11, 1934. For the next six years she often accompanied Willie on stage, singing or dancing, in performances in Chicago, Atlanta and elsewhere, and in the company of artists such as Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith. The two were invited to record for Decca Records by executive Mayo Williams in 1935, but the recordings from these sessions had extremely limited releases. In late June 1936, they recorded 12 blues songs with Piano Red for Vocalion Records. In 1939, she obtained a nursing certificate from Grady Hospital in Atlanta, and from 1942 until 1971 she was an army nurse at Fort Gordon hospital, near Augusta. As Willie lived in Atlanta for his career, the two rarely saw each other and drifted apart. Much of what is known about her husband comes from the interview she gave with the Evans family, published in Blues Unlimited magazine in 1977. After his death Ten years after her husband's death in 1959, she married Johnny E. Seabrooks, who was in the military. They had two children, Ernest and April. She retired from the hospital in 1971. After Seabrooks died in 1976, she lived a fairly private life, except for interviews she gave in 1977, 1979, and 1981 about Willie McTell. She died in Augusta, Georgia, on October 3, 1991. As Ruby Glaze There is some uncertainty as to whether Ruby Glaze, a singer with whom Willie McTell recorded in 1932, is the same person as Kate McTell.Bastin (1986). p. 132. In an interview conducted in the 1970s, she claimed that she was Glaze.Gray (2007). p. 229. The uncertainty stems from confusion over when she first met Willie and whether or not this was after he had recorded with Glaze. Bruce Bastin gave the year of their meeting as 1931,Bastin (1986). p. 133. at her graduation from Paine College, in Augusta, Georgia, and stated that immediately afterward she went on to Washington High in Atlanta, which is where and when Willie recorded with Glaze. Bastin also noted the similarities between Glaze's spoken parts in \\"Searching the Desert for the Blues\\" and the ones in the McTells' recording of \\"Ticket Agent Blues\\" in 1935. As mentioned above, McTell told the musicologist David Evans and his family that she had met Willie in late 1931 and that they recorded soon afterward over the course of a week. Gray placed this recording in February 1932. Some sources have claimed that McTell and Glaze are the same person,Conner, Patrick. \\"Blind Willie McTell \\". East Coast Piedmont Blues.

Ebey was born in Columbus, Ohio in 1818. During his childhood Ebey's father, Jacob, moved the family to Adair County, Missouri, where as a young man Ebey was trained in the law. At age 25, Ebey married Rebecca Davis and they later had two sons, Eason (who became Phoebe Judson's son-in-law) and Ellison. Born with a naturally adventurous spirit, Isaac temporarily left his wife and young sons in Missouri to explore the American west ‚Äì specifically the Pacific Coast.  Journey West  During his journey west, Ebey briefly tried his hand at gold-mining during the California gold-rush and then headed north to Oregon Territory. After arriving in the Puget Sound region he went to work for the U.S. Customs service. While with the service, Ebey spent some time in Olympia, the city he is credited with naming in honor of the Olympic Peninsula mountains to the west of Puget Sound. Ebey also sponsored a statute to name King County, Washington. Hearing of the islands in the north end of the sound, Ebey came upon Whidbey Island and fell in love with the natural beauty, climate, and rich land perfect for farming.  Homesteading Whidbey Island  In October 1850, Ebey moved from Olympia to Whidbey Island. When Congress passed the Donation Land Claim Act in 1850, Ebey claimed for himself and his family overlooking Admiralty Inlet then wrote his wife to prepare for a move west with their sons. The remainder of Ebey's family followed in October 1854. Among those of Ebey's family who came to the Pacific Northwest were: Ebey's parents, Jacob and Sarah; siblings, Mary, Winfield, and Ruth; Mary's two children, Almira and Polk Wright; a cousin, George Beam. Jacob Ebey claimed ridge land overlooking what is today called Ebey's Prairie. On the same ridge, Isaac Ebey built a blockhouse for protection against raiding Indians. Isaac and Jacob Ebey's land would prove to be some of the most productive in the area and word of this fortune traveled, drawing settlers from the east into the region and starting a rush of settlers who claimed most of the prairie- land by the beginning of 1853. By 1860, all of the best farmland had already been claimed.  Establishing a presence  Like other American farmers of European descent on Whidbey Island, Ebey grew wheat and potatoes, as well as onions, carrots, cabbages, parsnips, peas, barley and other grains. Taking advantage of the natural landing at his property on the shores of Admiralty Inlet he built a dock for the commercial ship traffic on Puget Sound in order to facilitate trade from Port Townsend on the Olympic Peninsula. Because most transportation in the area moved by water, the location of what was now called Ebey's Landing (on the main Puget Sound shipping route) minimized transportation costs. The landing remained active until the turn of the 20th Century when a new dock was built at Fort Casey, just a few miles away. During his nine years in the Pacific Northwest, Isaac Ebey was a vital player in territorial affairs. Serving as prosecuting attorney for the Whidbey Island community he also represented Thurston County (Olympia) in the Oregon Territorial Legislature when that county still stretched to the 49th parallel. Ebey also assisted in helping persuade the legislature to sign the Monticello Memorial, separating Oregon and Washington Territories in 1853, and assisted in breaking Thurston County into four smaller areas: Island, Jefferson, King, and Pierce Counties. Appointed by President Franklin Pierce to be collector for the Puget Sound district and inspector of revenues at the new state capital in Olympia, Ebey relocated his customs office to Port Townsend and made it the official port of entry for Puget Sound.  Colonel Ebey  In 1855 the Washington Territorial Legislature passed the first set of regulations establishing Washington Territorial Volunteer Militia. These regulations required that each council district (upper house in the territorial legislature) elect a Colonel, Lieutenant Colonel and a Major. These individuals were expected to divide their council districts into smaller areas with 100 men in each. Colonel Ebey was elected to a three-year term for Jefferson and Island counties. After raising a company of volunteers to fight in the mainland Indian wars of 1855‚Äì1856, Col. Ebey was again elected by this company to act as their Captain. Well respected among the residents, prospective volunteers refused to enlist unless they would serve under his command and named the fort they built on an island in the Snohomish river after him. A log of Fort Ebey can be read www.washingtonguard.org-museum- document-FIELDS_Vol_II (2)(Not to be confused with Fort Ebey on Whidbey Island, Washington State built during WW2)  Death  Rebecca Ebey was never happy about the family's encounters with local aboriginal peoples. Living some distance from the other Euro-American farmers, she stayed close to home managing the household during Isaac's long absences. Already weakened by tuberculosis, Rebecca died in 1853 following the difficult birth, and subsequent death, of the Ebeys' newborn daughter, Sarah. Ebey soon married Emily Palmer Sconce, a widow with a daughter named Anna. In 1857, a party of northern (possibly Haida) natives traveled by canoe into Puget Sound on a mission of vengeance. Following the death of one of their chiefs and 27 other tribal members in an attack by the USS Massachusetts the previous year, the party searched for a white Hyas Tyee (great chief) in retaliation. Originally, the intended victim was Dr. John Coe Kellogg, who lived near the present day Admiralty Head lighthouse. On the hot summer evening of August 11, unable to locate Kellogg (who was out of the area), the natives beached at Ebey's Landing and traversed the steep cliff up to Ebey's home. Knocking on Isaac Ebey's door, the natives called him out of the house, shot him dead, and beheaded him. Emily and the children fled to Jacob Ebey's blockhouse on the ridge, and George and Lucretia Corliss (in-laws of Phoebe Judson) escaped into the forest. Unwilling to remain on the farm, Emily abandoned it, leaving forever with her daughter Anna. Isaac Ebey's relatives raised Ellison and Eason, and the two brothers later divided their father's farm between them. There is question whether the raiders were actually Haida (as inscribed on a historical marker at Ebey's Landing). Traditional stories of the Keex' Kw√°an (Kake) tribe of Tlingits tell of the raid being led by a female relative of the slain chief in the Massachusetts attack. Those stories also tell that the female leader of the raid was a member of the Tsaagweid√≠ clan. In fact, the Puget Sound Herald of Steilacoom published an article fifteen months after Ebey's assassination stating the Kake and Stikine nations, \\"numbering a couple hundred,\\" were responsible for the \\"cold blooded murder.\\" However, it was never known which particular tribe perpetrated the death and beheading of Ebey. Ebey's scalp Isaac Ebey's headless remains were interred in the original Ebey family cemetery located at Ebey's Prairie on the bluff overlooking Isaac and Rebecca's home. Ebey's first wife Rebecca was already interred there, along with their daughter Hetty. The rest of the Ebey family is officially interred at Sunnyside Cemetery, from the burial place of Isaac. Captains Swanston and Charles Dodd of the Hudson's Bay Company steamer Beaver attempted to purchase Ebey's scalp about a year after his death, but were unsuccessful when the Kake Nation took the request as a first step in an attack of their village. It is rumored the Kake refused to sell Ebey's scalp because it was customary to dance around the scalps of their enemies killed in battle during annual feasts. They also believed the scalp held great family importance and should be handed down through generations. About three years after Ebey's murder, Captain Dodd now on the steamer Labouchere again attempted to purchase the scalp of his slain friend, and was successful. Dodd acquired the scalp for a liberal reward of \\"six blankets, 3 pipes, 1 cotton handkerchief, 6 heads of tobacco, 1 fthm. cotton,\\" and gave it to A. M. Poe, Esq. to be returned to Ebey's brother, Winfield. On April 5, 1860, Winfield Ebey noted in his diary the much awaited return of his brother's \\"poor head\\": While some historians insist Winfield‚Äîa prolific diarist‚Äîhad the scalp buried with his brother's body, no record of this claim exists. After Winfield's death in 1865, at least five separate accounts maintain that Ebey's sister, Mary Ebey Bozarth, inherited the relic. Albert Kellogg, the son of Dr. John Kellogg, recalled visiting Bozarth \\"ten or twelve years\\" after the murder and \\"she showed the scalp lock still retaining the long black hair. It was the only thing of that kind I had ever seen and I remember it caused cold chills to run over me.\\" After Bozarth died in 1876, Ebey's scalp was passed on to his niece, Almira Enos. The next mention of its location occurred in 1892 when Almira visited Whidbey, an event noted by the Island County Times. In the newspaper's July 29, 1892 issue it was reported: But Enos also visited an old friend, Hugh Crockett, who was quoted by the Times as saying that Enos \\"told me only a few weeks ago that she has (the scalp) at her house in San Francisco.\\" Those two articles are the most reliable accounts to date of where that \\"sad memento\\" of Ebey's death was kept. At this time only one other reference to the scalp's whereabouts has been found. According to family reports, the scalp was last known to be in the possession of the Almira Enos family in California as of 1914.  Legacy  The area around Isaac Ebey's original homestead is today a living memorial to his pioneer legacy. Fort Ebey (established in 1942) on the west side of the central part of the island (just northwest of Coupeville) is named in his honor. The rich farmland claimed by Isaac and his father Jacob is still called Ebey's Prairie and is farmed to this day. Ebey's Landing, while no longer a docking port, is named for the beachfront located just below the still-standing Ferry House built in 1860. The Landing is now a National Historical Reserve and was the first NHR in the United States. External views of the Ferry House and the surrounding Ebey's Prairie can be seen in scenes from the 1999 movie Snow Falling On Cedars, depicting the homestead of fictional German immigrant, Carl Heine, Sr. See also *History of Olympia *Port Gamble, Washington *Ebey's Landing National Historical Reserve References United States Customs Service personnel Ebey's Landing National Historical Reserve History of Washington (state) History of Island County, Washington History of Olympia, Washington Native American history of Washington (state) 1818 births 1857 deaths American murder victims Assassinated American people Deaths by firearm in Washington (state) Deaths by decapitation People murdered in Washington (state) People from Adair County, Missouri People from Columbus, Ohio People from Island County, Washington ","title":"Isaac N.

Broughton 2.115 n. 1 History Glaber was a member of a Roman plebeian family. He might have a distant connection with the famous patrician Claudii. Glaber, who was one of eight elected praetors in 73 BC, is only mentioned by classical historians in connection with his disastrous military leadership against Spartacus. They note his force of Roman militia (not professional legionaries)Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116. was destroyed because he was unable to adapt to the gladiators' unorthodox tactics.Frontinus, Stratagems, Book I, 5:20‚Äì22 and Book VII:6. After Glaber besieged the slaves on slopes of Mount Vesuvius, he failed to anticipate what they would do next. Spartacus' forces used rappelling lines made from local vegetation to scale down the cliffs on the other side of the mountain. They then outflanked Glaber's militia, annihilating his forces.Plutarch, Crassus, 9:1‚Äì3; Frontinus, Stratagems, Book I, 5:20‚Äì22; Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116; Broughton, Magistrates of the Roman Republic, p. 109. Note: Plutarch and Frontinus write of expeditions under the command of \\"Clodius the praetor\\" and \\"Publius Varinus\\", while Appian writes of \\"Varinius Glaber\\" and \\"Publius Valerius\\". Roman records make no further mention of Glaber after this defeat. It is not known whether he was killed during the battle, or was simply considered too obscure for further mention by classical historians.Strauss, p. 61. Classics scholar Barry S. Strauss noted that his obscurity might also have been another sign of how little attention the Roman Senate gave Spartacus in 73 BC.Strauss, p. 52. Portrayals in fiction Glaber appears in Robert Harris's novel Imperium, which chronicles the career of Marcus Tullius Cicero. Harris has Glaber retire from public life \\"in humiliation\\" following his failure to defeat Spartacus, but as an old man he returns to politics in the role of foreign praetor.Harris, Imperium (2006), p. 331. In screen adaptations of the life of Spartacus, Glaber has been portrayed: * by John Dall as \\"Glabrus\\", a character loosely based on Glaber, in the 1960 film Spartacus * by Ben Cross as \\"Titus Glabrus\\" in the 2004 TV miniseries Spartacus * by Craig Parker in the 2010 TV series Spartacus: Blood and Sand, and its 2012 sequel Spartacus: Vengeance. In contrast to other versions, Glaber is portrayed as Spartacus' personal enemy who is responsible for making him a slave.

History The Central DuPage Hospital Association was established in 1958 when citizens from Glen Ellyn, Lombard, Wheaton, Warrenville, Winfield and West Chicago banded together to restore a sanitarium located on the hospital's current primary site. After an extensive million-dollar renovation project, Central DuPage Hospital opened on September 16, 1964 with 113 beds and 66 physicians. The hospital saw much change throughout the 1970s, with the opening of a 120-bed pavilion on December 13, 1970, small additions in 1971 and 1972, and a five-story 112-bed patient tower in 1976. The facility and campus continued to expand in the decades that followed, with much of the original structure eventually reused or demolished, culminating in the construction of a new $232 million five-story bed tower with 202 private rooms in 2011. In 2011, Central DuPage Health (the successor parent to the Central DuPage Hospital Association) merged with Delnor Health System, the parent of Delnor Hospital of Geneva, Illinois, to form Cadence Health System.

Born in Blackrock, Cork, Cashman first played competitive hurling during his schooling at Col√°iste Chr√≠ost R√≠. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Cork minor team before later joining the under-21 side. He made his senior debut during the 1985 Oireachtas Cup. Cashman subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won two All-Ireland medals, three Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Cashman won one Railway Cup medal. At club level he is a two-time championship medallist with Blackrock. Cashman's father, Mick Cashman, his uncle, Jimmy Brohan, and his brother, Tom Cashman, all played for Cork. Throughout his career Cashman made 29 championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1996 championship. In retirement from playing Cashman became involved in team management and coaching. At club level he has been involved in coaching at underage levels with Blackrock. Cashman is regarded as one of Cork's best players of his era. During his playing days he won two All-Star awards. Cashman was also chosen as one of the 25 best Cork players of the past 25 years in a 2013 poll. Playing career=Club After enjoying little championship success in the minor and under-21 grades with Blackrock, Cashman subsequently joined the senior team. In 1985 Blackrock faced Midleton in the championship decider. Cashman, in the company of his brother Tom, Michael Browne, Kilkennyman Frank Cummins, √âamonn O'Donoghue and Finbarr Delaney, gave a masterful display. A 1-14 to 1-8 victory gave Cashman, who also earned the man of the match award, a first championship medal. After failing to retain the title Blackrock went into a period of decline. After losing the 1998 decider to Imokilly, Cashman lined out in a fourth championship decider the following year. A 3-17 to 0-8 trouncing of University College Cork, with Cashman giving a man of the match display again, gave him a second championship medal. Inter-county Cashman first played for Cork as a goalkeeper on the minor team on 16 May 1981 in a 2-6 to 0-6 Munster semi-final defeat by Clare. He was moved to centre- back the following year before being dropped to the substitutes' bench in his final year as a minor in 1983. In 1985 Cashman joined the Cork under-21 team, however, his two-year tenure in this grade ended without success. Cashman made his senior debut for Cork on 10 November 1985 in a 2-11 to 1-10 Oireachtas final defeat of Galway. He was a regular throughout the subsequent league campaign and was included in Cork's championship team in 1986. Cork made it five-in-a-row in Munster that year as they defeated Clare by 2‚Äì18 to 3‚Äì12 to take the provincial title. It was Cashman's first Munster medal. This victory paved the way for an All-Ireland final meeting with Galway on 7 September 1986. The men from the west were the red-hot favourites against a Cork team in decline, however, on the day a different story unfolded. Four Cork goals, one from John Fenton, two from Tom√°s Mulcahy and one from Kevin Hennessy, stymied the Galway attack and helped the Rebels to a 4‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì15 victory. It was Cashman's first All-Ireland medal. In 1990 Cork bounced back after a period in decline. He won his second Munster medal that year following a 4-16 to 2-14 defeat of Tipperary. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 2 September 1990 pitted Cork against Galway for the second time in four years. Galway were once again the red-hot favourites and justified this tag by going seven points ahead in the opening thirty-five minutes thanks to a masterful display by Cashman's opposite number Joe Cooney. Cork fought back with an equally expert display by captain Tom√°s Mulcahy. The game was effectively decided on an incident which occurred midway through the second half when Cork goalkeeper Ger Cunningham blocked a point-blank shot from Martin Naughton with his nose. The umpires gave no 65-metre free, even though he clearly deflected it out wide. Cork went on to win a high-scoring and open game of hurling by 5‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì21. As well as winning a second All-Ireland medal Cashman was later presented with a first All-Star. Cork surrendered their All-Ireland crown to Tipperary in 1991, however, in spite of an early championship exit Cashman finished the year with a second All-Star. In 1992 Cashman claimed a third Munster medal following a 1-22 to 3-11 of Limerick. On 6 September 1992 Cork faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. At half-time Cork were two points ahead, however, two second-half goals by John Power and Michael \\"Titch\\" Phelan supplemented a first-half D. J. Carey penalty which gave Kilkenny a 3-10 to 1-12 victory. Cashman won a National Hurling League medal in 1993 following a 3-11 to 1-12 defeat of Wexford. After unsuccessful championship campaigns over the following three years, Cashman retired from inter-county hurling following Cork's exit from the 1996 championship. Inter-provincial Cashman was first picked for the Munster inter-provincial team in 1987, however, Munster's campaign ended at the semi-final stage. He made it onto the starting fifteen in 1991, however, Munster fell to an all-Galway Connacht team by 1-13 to 0-12 in the decider. In 1992 Cashman was at centre-back as Munster faced Ulster in the decider. A 3-12 to 1-8 victory gave Cashman a Railway Cup medal.

Kornienko began the year long mission in March 2015, blasting off on Soyuz TMA-16M Personal life Kornienko was born in Syzran, Kuybyshev Oblast, Russian SFSR. He is married to Irina Kornienko, a doctor. They have a grown daughter. His father Boris G. Kornienko, a military pilot, perished in an Mi-6 helicopter crash in October 1965. His mother, Faina M. Kornienko, born in 1931 is retired. Education Kornienko graduated from secondary school No. 15, Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 1977. From 1981 to 1987 he studied at the Moscow Aviation Institute named after S. Ordzhonikidze. Military career and experience Upon graduation from school in 1977, he worked at a radio equipment plant in Chelyabinsk, Russia. In May 1978, Kornienko was called to service in the Soviet Army. He served in the Airborne Forces (VDV) in Kirovabad, Azerbaijan in the USSR. In May 1980, he completed his military service with the rank of junior sergeant. Kornienko worked for the Moscow Municipal Militsiya from 1980‚Äì1986. At the same time he attended the evening department of the Moscow Aviation Institute. Upon graduation in 1987 from the Institute, he was qualified as a liquid propellant rocket engines mechanical engineer. He resigned from the Militsiya in 1986 and entered a mechanical engineering design bureau. During 1986 to 1991 Kornienko worked in the Baikonur Launch Facility as a launch equipment specialist. He worked for commercial companies between late 1991 to early 1995. From October 1991 to December 1992 he was the OOO Transvostok Technical and Production Department Director. From January 1993 to April 1995 he was the LLC ESTE General Director. In October 1995, Kornienko started working at the Energia Rocket Space Corporation (RSC Energia) as an engineer. He was assigned to develop technical documentation for cosmonaut primary and backup crew tests and training. He took part in extravehicular activity (EVA) tests in simulated zero-gravity at the hydrolab and at the Selen dynamic stand. In the process of this work he acquired experience in organizing extravehicular repair/refurbishment and assembly activities on the Mir orbital station. He also directly participated in testing the Energia RSC production on the testing ground. Cosmonaut career Mikhail Kornienko near floating tomatoes in the Unity Node of the ISS. On 24 February 1998, Kornienko was selected as a test cosmonaut candidate and, in 1999, following basic training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, he was qualified as a test cosmonaut. Since 1999, he has trained in the International Space Station group. He served on the ISS Expedition 8 backup crew as a flight engineer. In 2005, he was assigned to the Soyuz TMA-10 and Expedition 15 back-up crew as Flight Engineer 1.  Expedition 23/24  Kornienko services the Russian Bioemulsion experiment in the Pirs Docking Compartment. Kornienko was aboard the space station as a Flight Engineer, being part of the Expedition 23/24 crew. He lifted off on 2 April 2010, along with fellow Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Skvortsov and NASA astronaut Tracy Caldwell-Dyson aboard Soyuz TMA-18 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Ending Expedition 24, the Soyuz TMA-18 spacecraft carrying Mikhail Kornienko, Alexander Skvortsov and NASA astronaut Tracy Caldwell-Dyson undocked from the space station at 10:02 pm EDT on 24 September 2010. Following a normal descent, the Soyuz crew landed at 5:23 am GMT ear Arkalyk, Kazakhstan on 25 September. After returning to Earth and sharing his experiences to an audience, Kornienko said \\"The thing you miss there most of all is the Earth itself, I missed smells. I missed trees, I even dreamt of them. I even hallucinated. I thought I smelled a real fire and something being barbecued on it! I ended up putting pictures of trees on the walls to cheer up. You do miss the Earth there\\". Spacewalks On 27 July 2010 Kornienko and fellow Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin participated in a spacewalk outside the ISS. The two cosmonauts on 23 July put on their Orlan spacesuits and performed a dry run of the spacewalk activities. From inside the Pirs docking compartment they checked out the Orlan systems, practiced translation movements and tested their mobility. During the spacewalk, Kornienko and Yurchikhin outfitted the Rassvet module's (MRM1) Kurs automated rendezvous system, installed cables and remove and replaced a video camera. The spacewalk began at 04:11 UTC as Kornienko and Yurchikhin donned in Orlan spacesuits, depressurized the internal volume of the Pirs docking compartment airlock and ventured outside into space. It was the 25th Russian spacewalk performed from the station. At one point around 06:45 UTC the two spacewalkers accidentally lost an unidentified object that floated away from their perch on the side of the ISS. The cosmonauts speculated that the lost item was an attachment fixture to secure the cables in place once they are installed. About an hour later, another unidentified item, appeared to be a washer accidentally floated off. The spacewalk lasted six hours and 42 minutes. ISS year long mission Patch for yearlong mission In November 2012, NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos), and their international partners selected two veteran spacefarers for a one-year mission aboard the International Space Station in 2015. This mission included collecting scientific data important to future human exploration of our solar system. NASA selected Scott Kelly and Roscosmos chose Mikhail Kornienko. Kelly and Kornienko launched aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan in March 2015 and landed on 1 March 2016 at 22:00. Kelly and Kornienko already have a connection; Kelly was a backup crew member for the station's Expedition 23/24 crews, where Kornienko served as a flight engineer. The goal of their yearlong expedition aboard the orbiting laboratory was to understand better how the human body reacts and adapts to the harsh environment of space. Data from the 12-month expedition will help inform current assessments of crew performance and health and will determine better and validate countermeasures to reduce the risks associated with future exploration as NASA plans for missions around the moon, an asteroid and ultimately Mars. Film In 2016 Kornienko appeared as himself in the comedy film Yolki 5.

Most of his adult career and recognition was in the United States. Life and art career Crucifixion of Mankind, 1961 Oliver O'Connor Barrett studied at Fircroft College in England but was largely self-taught as a sculptor. In 1933 Barrett exhibited at the Royal Academy. In 1937-38 he carved a panel, The Temptation of St. Anthony and fifteen keystones for a block of flats, called Viceroy Close, in Edgbaston, Birmingham. The work was designed and executed in the almost cartoonish manner that was to become one of the several styles that Barrett was comfortable in. In 1940 he moved to the United States where he settled with his family in New York City. In 1942 he exhibited at the New Orleans Art Center, in 1945 at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and in 1946, 1948 and 1950 at Audubon Artists. Barrett was one of the sculptors who exhibited at the 3rd Sculpture International, sponsored by the Fairmount Park Art Association and held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1949. Sculpture Continuum In 1962, as the 1964 New York World's Fair was being planned, Barrett was commissioned to create the Sculpture Continuum Playground. In his book Myself Emerging it states that the \\"CONTINUUM principle was invented and patented by Barrett in America. Other designs based on the principle are available, adapted to various environmental situations.\\" It is unclear as to what became of the playground following the end of the fair in 1965. Regarding this work, Barrett quotes a letter from the eminent art historian Herbert Read in which Read states, \\"You have given a new spacial development to the Art of sculpture.\\" The Sculpture Continuum playground was disassembled and stored for a while under the Van Wyck Expressway after the World's Fair closed in 1965, next to the disassembled World's Fair Pavilion (a geodesic dome). Eventually the dome was reassembled nearby and now serves as the Bird Aviary for the Queens Zoo. The Sculpture Continuum was acquired by Long Island's Valley Stream Union Free School District (District 13), where it was installed as playground equipment at Willow Road Elementary. After many years of outdoor use, it was moved into storage by the school district. Eventually at least three of the best pieces, including the elephant and the giraffe, were returned to district elementary schools for outdoor display (but not playground use). The elephant is displayed in front of Willow Road Elementary, and another piece is believed to be at Dever Elementary. In New York, Barrett taught as Instructor of Sculpture at the Cooper Union Art School and the Museum of Modern Art. In the ensuing years he lived in several American cities including New Orleans, Louisiana and Palm Beach, Florida, where he served as head of the art department at the Norton School of Art before returning to Great Britain and retiring to the Welsh valley of Cwm Prysor, near Trawsfynydd. Some of his artwork is in the collection of Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery, in the UK. His papers are in the collection of the Smithsonian Archives of American Art. Myself Emerging In 1980 Barrett published the book, Myself Emerging, consisting primarily of selections of his poetry interspersed with photographs of his sculpture. The book is prefaced with the statement, \\"With age, my development as a man, and perhaps as a poet, seems to have accelerated. Feelings are more intense and, becoming more open. I receive their full impact, whether joy or pain. Nor do I feel the need to justify or make them consistent.\\" An intensely personal side of Barrett is revealed in his early poems. First Love (1927) finds him longing to be \\"crushed beneath a last caress of your all too- powerful hand\\", while in Lonely One, written during World War II, the author wants to grieve, but is restrained from doing so by those who dictate \\"KEEP A STIFF UPPER LIP AND DON'T GIVE WAY! DON'T FEEL DON'T THINK DON'T BROOD DON'T BE.\\" Abraham and Isaak, 1944 In the book the reader can trace the development of Barrett's style from his early purely figurative work of the 1930s through the abstracting of his figures during the 1950s and 1960s and finally a return to the realistic portraiture in his last years. In looking at the body of work, poetic and sculptural, that is presented in the book it is clear that the themes that Barrett was interested in, spirituality,mythology, eroticism and a love of music, were ones that he was drawn to early in his life and never abandoned. A poem \\"Isaak Speaks\\", written in September 1979, addresses the biblical story, where Abraham is so devoted to God that he is prepared to sacrifice his own son, although at the last minute an angel stops this from happening. In Barrett's short poem, \\"Being conceivable is deed enough\\" and the thought is enough to wreak the destruction. It ends: :O Father Abraham :I am unsexed :your knife is buried in my brain.

After recording their shoegaze-influenced debut album Methodrone (1995) and releasing a collection of early recordings, Spacegirl & Other Favorites, the band took influence from 1960s British psychedelic garage rock and recorded Take it from the Man! from November 1995‚ÄìFebruary 1996. After recording the entire album with an unnamed producer who scrapped the recordings, the band re-recorded the album on a minimal budget, mostly at Lifesource Studios in Emeryville, California with production from Psychic TV's Larry Thrasher, whose usual \\"studio\\" approach was vetoed out by the band's back-to-basics approach. The album's psychedelic garage rock has often been compared to the Rolling Stones. Released by Bomp! Records on May 28, 1996, it is the first of three full-length albums released by the band in 1996, preceding Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request and Thank God for Mental Illness. The album was released to critical acclaim, with journalists praising the exuding of its influences and spirit. Newcombe has since named the album as one of his favorites by the band. The album has featured in several \\"best of\\" lists and has been cited by several musicians as an influence. \\"Straight Up and Down\\", which is featured in two alternate versions on the album, later became the theme music for Boardwalk Empire. Background In 1995, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, lead by frontman Anton Newcombe, along with bassist Matt Hollywood, guitarist Dean Taylor, organist Mara Regal, accordionist Dawn Thomas, drummer Brian Glaze, and \\"Spokesman for the Revolution\\" Joel Gion released their debut album Methodrone which featured a shoegazing-influenced style. Although the album was critically acclaimed, the band never returned the album's sound \\"in full,\\" and issued Spacegirl & Other Favorites later in the year, a collection of the band's earliest recordings from 1993. Looking for a change in direction, and under the influence of 1960s British rock music, the band soon began work on Take it from the Man!. In the liner notes, Newcombe jokingly recalls the album's conception: Recording According to the liner notes, Take it from the Man! was recorded \\"live\\" between November 1995 and February 1996 at Dance Home Studio and Larry Thrasher's Lifesource Studios in Emeryville, California, with digital editing undertaken at Music Box, Hollywood. The band initially recorded Take it from the Man! with an unnamed producer who, in wanting to \\"get on board\\", recorded the album and \\"chopped it up to make it like so perfect\\" and then requested 3% of the royalties, leading the band to \\"just [laugh] in his face.\\" As a result, the producer, as Newcombe recalled it, \\"got so pissed and he said he was going to destroy the recording. I was like, 'Fuck you dude. Then I'm gonna kick your ass the minute I see you on the street.' He did end up destroying it but I let him off the hook as far as the violence.\\" With the band needing to re-record the album in its entirety, Larry Thrasher from Psychic TV became interested in the band and producing the album, and borrowed a recording studio, possibly belonging to the Counting Crows, for the band to record in, presumably his Lifesource Studios credited in the liner notes. Newcombe stated that, with a line-up of Newcombe, Dean Taylor (guitar), Matt Hollywood (bass) and Brian Glaze (drums), the band showed up on the day of recording without guitarist Jeff Davies because \\"he was a junkie\\" and so Newcombe's girlfriend Dawn played guitar instead. The album was recorded on a minimal budget. When the band turned up to the studio, they were surprised to find that Thrasher had \\"about sixteen microphones set up for the drums,\\" because the band preferred a stripped down studio approach; Newcombe stated that \\"I asked him, 'What the hell is this?' and he said, 'Well, these are for the drums‚Ä¶' and I was like, 'We don't need sixteen mics for the drums. Take all of these away. I'm gonna use three mics for the drums and we're gonna record it live, all at once. We're just gonna put all the guitar amps down the hallway, the drums will be in here, and we'll put on headphones and we'll just play our set.' We record everything the same way, so that's what we did and then at the end he whipped out all of these effects when mixing at his studio and I just asked him, 'What are all of these for?' and he said, 'You can't have it sound the same on every song' and I'm like 'Bullshit, that's the charm of this,' we just try and get a certain sound.\\" Newcombe noted that \\"Straight Up and Down\\" was mixed to cassette. The band were recording their follow up album Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request (1996) concurrently with Take it from the Man!, although not in the same studio or with the same producer. Newcombe recalled \\"recording Take It from the Man in the day time and then recording Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request in the nighttime. I was doing them simultaneously. I would go and stay at this one studio and then take the train out to the other one so instead of being homeless I was going between these two studios and crashing on the couches and doing two, 18 song records at the same time.\\"  Music  Finding the band exploring further territory, Take It from the Man! was another change of style for the band, taking a large influence from 1960s British garage rock, particularly the early work of The Rolling Stones. The Phoenix New Times characterized the album as \\"psychedelic garage rock\\". Under the Radar said the album was \\"Rolling Stones-referencing,\\" while Consequence of Sound said the record carried a \\"mid '60s era Stones rock & roll feel.\\" Laut more broadly said the album \\"deals with British music from the 60s,\\" noting \\"(David Bowie I Love You) Since I Was Six\\" as an example. Angel Fire said the album was \\"inspired by the gritty R&B; of Aftermath or 12x5. The feedback and production is total 90's, but the style is straight 1964, and a glorious style it is.\\" Joel Gion talked down the recognized similarities, saying \\"Take it from the Man was largely described as a December's Children nuts and bolts Rhythm & Blues sound. We don't purposely go out for that. We just like that music. I think there were higher standards for music during the '60s. You could take Top 40 music from then and check out the quality.\\" The Brian Jonestown Massacre in 2004. All of the songs on Take it from the Man! were written by Newcombe, except for \\"Oh Lord\\", \\"B.S.A.\\", \\"Cabin Fever\\" and \\"In My Life\\", which were written by Matt Hollywood. Referring to the songs \\"Caress\\" and \\"Who?\\", Newcombe stated \\"I might have written those songs getting drunk up in Portland at Zia's [Zia McCabe of The Dandy Warhols] house with everybody after a show. I used to really love writing songs in front of people with acoustic guitars or whatever just to show off with my mates, it used to make me really happy to be clever.\\" Characterizing it as the album's epitome, Jason Ankeny of Allmusic said that opening song \\"Vacuum Boots\\" sets up the album's \\"gritty, swaggering R&B-influenced; rock, delivered with remarkable assurance and attitude.\\" \\"B.S.A.\\" is an electric blues song which \\"[swaggers] like mad.\\" \\"(David Bowie I Love You) Since I Was Six\\" is, as the name suggests, a tribute to David Bowie and has been described as \\"such a nice way to mix up the album.\\" \\"Dawn\\" was later re-recorded on the band's first and only album with TVT Records, Strung Out in Heaven (1998). The Village Voice characterized \\"Mary, Please\\" as \\"trippy with partially dejected yet sincere lyricism\\" and \\"filled with meticulously placed tambourine and cymbals.\\" \\"Straight Up and Down\\", which \\"blisters with energy,\\" appears twice on the album as two different takes of varying length on tracks 6 and 18. The long version of \\"Straight Up and Down\\", in particular, clearly indicates two of the band's biggest '60s influences, as by the final minutes of the song, the vocals mimic both the \\"Woo-woo!\\" backing vocals from The Rolling Stones' song \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" and the \\"Na-na- na-na!\\" vocals from The Beatles' song \\"Hey Jude\\"; Ankeny described the song as an \\"epic finale.\\"  Release Take it from the Man! was released on CD and double LP on May 28, 1996 by independent record label Bomp! Records as their second release on the label, and was the first of three albums that the band released that year, followed by Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request and Thank God for Mental Illness. The album was not a commercial success. In 2006, Tee Pee Records released two different anniversary double LP editions in the United States; the standard edition was printed on black vinyl while the special edition was printed on translucent blue and green vinyl. On June 25, 2007, Newcombe's A Records released a remastered CD edition in the UK, who also issued the translucent blue and orange double LP edition in the same country on August 16, 2010 and a remastered CD edition in the US on February 16, 2012. The packaging of Take it from the Man! prominently features the Union Jack, reflecting the British influence on the album, and the American flag reflecting the band's home nation. Thrasher wrote an essay on his preference for analog recording over digital recording in the liner notes. After a Vendetta Mag journalist told Newcombe he \\"especially loved\\" the essay, Newcombe stated \\"I really like getting together with my friends and writing that kind of stuff. We just talk about ideas. So many people don't even have a clue why they're doing stuff or they can't tell you. They won't admit it. I really love music and I want to put out stuff that isn't out there. I don't care what people think...if they think it's derivative or invoking a certain time period or what have you. I'm just doing it because it's the music I like. It doesn't exist unless I animate it.\\" Critical reception The album was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers praising its influence and tight sound. AllMusic's Jason Ankeny described the album as \\"brilliant\\" and said that \\"singer Anton Newcombe is half madman and half shaman, and he commands each delirious moment with absolute mastery, emerging not so much a disciple of Mick Jagger but as a serious threat to the throne.\\"V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, eds, All Music Guide to the Blues: The Definitive Guide to the Blues (Backbeat, 3rd edn., 2003), pp. 700-2.\\" He said that tracks like \\"Who?,\\" \\"(David Bowie I Love You) Since I Was Six,\\" and the \\"Straight up and Down\\" are \\"simply amazing, evoking rock's golden age without ever disintegrating into slavish devotion‚Äìclearly, the BJM is a group that believes in killing their idols, and their intensity begs the question: just who is the World's Greatest Rock & Roll Band again?\\" Skiddle called it a \\"classic\\" album. Pitchfork said that, alongside the band's other 1996 albums, Take it from the Man! \\"essentially mapped out the boundaries of their sound.\\" Jumping Fences ranked the album at number 6 in their list of the top 10 albums of 1996. In 2014, French magazine Rock & Folk included the album in their list of \\"555 Disques 1954‚Äì2014: Soixante Ans de Rock'n'Roll\\" (\\"555 Records 1954‚Äì2014: Sixty Years of Rock 'n' Roll\\").Rock & Folk 555 Disques 1954‚Äì2014: Soixante Ans de Rock'n'Roll special issue (2014) Alongside Thank God for Mental Illness, FasterLouder called it the band's \\"sublime high watermark.\\" Legacy In 1998, Newcombe stated that Take it from the Man!, alongside Give It Back!, Thank God for Mental Illness and Their Satanic Majesties Second Request were his favorite albums by the band; \\"I like those four records a lot.\\" Amy Haben of Please Kill Me found similarities with the band's later album Mini Album Thingy Wingy (2015), saying the latter album is \\"reminiscent of their roots with genius melodies equivalent to 1996's Take It From The Man! only toned down a tad.\\" In 2015, The Village Voice included \\"Mary, Please\\" in their list of \\"Ten Nineties Earworms That Just Get Better with Age,\\" saying the song \\"isn't quite as dancy as 'Not If You Were the Last Dandy on Earth' or as mesmerizing as 'It Girl,' but it is just as essential and equally good.\\" As the album was the first of three from the band in 1996, in 2014, Music Times included the band \\"7 Artists Who Released Multiple Classic Albums in One Year.\\" \\"(David Bowie I Love You) Since I Was Six\\" was included on What Youth's\\" Stay Tuned playlist, praising the production and strained vocals. Several bands have cited the record as an influence; Leon James Kenny of Black Sonic Revolver cited the album as an influence, saying \\"we always listen to BJM before recording or demoing, their creativity inspires us. I remember the bench I was sat on when I first heard BJM album Take It From The Man! ‚Äì I bought it in Piccadilly Records in Manchester, only because it had the most songs on it. A friend said I'd love them, so took a punt. I had a \\"discman\\" on me that day, so I sat on a bench in Castlefield on a lovely day and pressed play. I'll never forget that first encounter,\\" while in 2011, Kristin Warnken of the Glossines included the album in a list of five albums \\"in her music player.\\" Rishi Dhir of Canadian indie rock band Elephant Stone included \\"Who?\\" in his list of \\"The Best of the Brian Jonestown Massacre\\". In 2010, \\"Straight Up and Down\\" was used as the theme music for the popular television period drama series Boardwalk Empire starring Steve Buscemi on the American cable network HBO. Some fans were reported confused at the song's inclusion as the theme music over a piece of period-appropriate music; the series' creator Terence Winter explained \\"I wanted unexpected. I didn't want to do some Charleston, which didn't really kick in until 1924 anyway, and everything I heard from the period had people doing the Charleston.\\" While experimenting with the opening, Winter says he paired the footage of one of its scenes with several different pieces of music before settling on \\"Straight Up and Down\\"; \\"I had been a fan of the Brian Jonestown Massacre, so we tried it, and I said to the editor, that really works for me.\\" Track listing All songs written and composed by The Brian Jonestown Massacre, except \\"Straight Up and Down\\" and \\"Monster\\", written by Newcombe and Jeff Davies.

Davis Company, a medical publishing company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1879.\\"Company Overview of F.A. Davis Company,\\" Bloomburg.\\"2019 Allied Members: F.A. Davis Company, California Association of Private Postsecondary Schools. Davis grew up in Vermont and began his working life as a teacher. During the summer of 1870, he traveled to Asbury Park, New Jersey, and found a job selling lawn-mowers. His success convinced him that sales was his vocation, so he moved to the nation's publishing center, Philadelphia, and became an agent for several publishing houses. In 1879, while working as an agent for William Wood and Company, a publisher and distributor for British publishers, Davis launched his company with a manuscript written by Dr. John V. Shoemaker, dean of the Medico-Chirurgical College, now called the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. In the 1880s and 1890s, F.A Davis focused his business activities on real estate development on Florida's Gulf Coast. He played a key role in developing St. Petersburg, Florida, and built the city‚Äôs first electrical power plant. Davis also founded the town of Pinellas Park, Florida, nearby. Davis turned his attention back to medical publishing after the F.A. Davis Company was reincorporated in 1901. He named Dr. Charles Eucharist de Medicis Sajous, the first person to hold a chair in endocrinology and the first president of The Endocrine Society, as editor that same year. Dr. Sajous published medically important and commercially successful works during his tenure as editor, including The Analytic Cyclopedia of Practical Medicine, which was called ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù by The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 1901. In 1917, F.A. Davis died and control of his business interests passed to his son from his first marriage, Alonzo B. Davis (1873‚Äì1942), and his second wife and widow, Irene Davis. Alonzo Davis focused on his father‚Äôs business enterprises in Florida until they fell victim to the Stock Market Crash of 1929. Irene Davis then assumed control of the publishing company and turned it into the strong enterprise that exists today. Irene Davis was said by her peers to be ‚Äúa tiny, energetic lady‚Äù whose ‚Äúsweetness and gentility cloaked a strong will‚Äù. One of her first tasks was to find a replacement for Dr. Sajous, who died shortly after F.A. Davis. She selected Dr. George Morris Piersol to edit the Analytic Cyclopedia, under whose leadership the work was expanded from eight to fifteen volumes and renamed The Cyclopedia of Medicine, Surgery and Specialties. To diversify the company‚Äôs list of publications, Davis also hired Clarence Wilbur Taber (1870‚Äì1967) as a full-time textbook editor in 1931. Clarence Taber published Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary with the F.A. Davis Company as well as thirty other textbooks used primarily by nurses that influenced nursing publishing for generations. The F.A. Davis Company Today Control of the F.A. Davis Company passed to Irene Davis‚Äôs nephew, Robert H. Craven, Sr., (born 1922), in 1960. Under Robert Craven, Sr., F.A. Davis parleyed its historic strength in publishing nursing textbooks into a focus on all of the allied health disciplines. The company is currently run by his son, Robert Craven, Jr. It is one of the few remaining independent companies publishing health- and science- related material in the English language. The F.A. Davis Company counts both faculty and students among its readers today. Its flagship publications, Taber‚Äôs Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary and Davis's Drug Guide for Nurses, as well as its online and mobile references, are trusted resources for healthcare professionals around the globe. Notable authors and books published The Internal Secretions and Principles of Medicine, edited by Dr. Charles Euchariste de Medicis Sajous, was published in nine editions between 1903 and 1922. The first edition established endocrinology as a distinct medical specialtyMedical Life, 25: 16, 1925. and made Dr. Sajous one of the leading medical figures of his time. The Cyclopedia of Medicine, Surgery, Specialties was edited by Dr. Charles Euchariste de Medicis Sajous. Dr. George Morris Piersol, Dean of the Graduate School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (1954‚Äì1957) and president of the American College of Physicians, took over as the encyclopedia's editor after Dr. Sajous‚Äôs death. In its 1901 review of the last volume of the series, the JAMA called the Analytic Cyclopedia an ‚Äúexcellent work‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe amount of work necessary to condense, systematize and co-ordinate all the vast amount of medical literature that these volumes represent has been enormous,‚Äù wrote JAMA's reviewer. \\"It covers every branch of medical knowledge and brings the literature of each up to recent times in such a manner that it can be referred to easily and with satisfaction.‚Äù That volume alone contained 1,043 pages, was illustrated with chromolithographs, engravings, and maps, and cost five dollars.The Journal of the American Medical Association, 1901.

Etymology The name Hastaka comes from the Sanskrit word hasta meaning \\"hand.\\" This refers to the disciple being handed over to the Buddha by the yak·π£a ƒÄ·π≠avaka and then by the Buddha to the king's messengers. Person According to the Pali Commentary (SA.iii.223), Hastaka was one of seven laymen who was always accompanied by five hundred lay disciples. He is mentioned in the Buddhavamsa xxvi.19 along with Citta as a chief layman and considered the foremost in gathering a following using the \\"four bases of sympathy\\" which are described as being: :1) giving gifts :2) speaking with kindly words :3) doing kindly deeds :4) treating people with equality The Buddha praised him for possessing an additional eight qualities: :1) faith :2) virtue :3) conscientiousness :4) fear of blame :5) ability to listen well :6) charity :7) wisdom :8) modesty Death and attainments Hastaka finally achieved the state of an AnƒÅgƒÅmi and was reborn in the Av·πõha heaven in the Pure Abodes. As a deity, he once tried to visit the Buddha, but collapsed and was unable to stand upright. The Buddha recommended that he assume a more gross physical form, after which he was able to regain his composure. Hastaka informed the Buddha that in this world, he was constantly surrounded by devas who wished to learn the Dharma from him. He also stated that he had passed away with three regrets: :1) not having seen enough of the Buddha :2) not having heard enough of the Dharma :3) not having served enough to the Sangha Past lives The Chinese version of the Vinayavibha·πÖga (T1442) relates a Jataka story of one of Hastaka's past lives. There were once two brothers who lived in the forest. The elder brother was named HastapƒÅdajƒÅlin (ÊâãË∂≥Á∂≤Èûî, pinyin: Sh«íuz√∫w«éngm√°n; Tibetan: rKang lag dra ba can) and the younger brother was named NirhastapƒÅdajƒÅlin (ÁÑ°Á∂≤Èûî, pinyin: W√∫w«éngm√°n; rKang lag dra bas ma 'brel ba; or simply JƒÅlika). The elder was an ascetic while the younger practiced under a teacher. On one occasion, one of the daughters of the teacher expressed interest in marrying NirhastapƒÅdajƒÅlin. He refused and she became infuriated. Due to her ability to stretch her arm far distances and that she shared an abode with demons, the brother decided to flee. She pursued him and in her rage, attempted to kill him with her sword. At the last moment, NirhastapƒÅdajƒÅlin cried out in devotion to his elder brother HastapƒÅdajƒÅlin, who swept him away to his hermitage. There he became an ascetic and developed the five supernormal powers like his brother. The text clarifies that HastapƒÅdajƒÅlin was the Buddha, NirhastapƒÅdajƒÅlin was Hastaka ƒÄ·π≠avaka and the woman was Queen ≈öyƒÅmavatƒ´.

While serving in South Vietnam as a medic with the rank of specialist five assigned to 1st Battalion of the 503rd Infantry in the 173rd Airborne Brigade, Joel received the Silver Star and the Medal of Honor for his heroism in a battle with the Viet Cong that occurred on November 8, 1965. He was the first medic to earn the Medal of Honor during the Vietnam War and the first living black American to receive this medal since the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898. Childhood Joel was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the third of 16 children. Due to the extreme poverty of his family, from the age of 8 to 18, Joel was raised by a neighboring family, the Samuels. Joel attended city public schools, including Atkins High School, and joined the Merchant Marine for one year. In 1946, at age 18, Joel decided to join the United States Army, making a career out of it. He enlisted in New York City. Vietnam War Specialist Six Joel with Medal of Honor and Certificate On November 8, 1965 then-Specialist Five Lawrence Joel and his battalion of paratroopers were sent on a patrol for Viet Cong soldiers near Bien Hoa, War Zone \\"D\\" in South Vietnam, conducting Operation Hump. They shortly found themselves in a Viet Cong ambush, outnumbered six to one. Under heavy gunfire, Joel did his duty as a medic, administering first aid to wounded soldiers. Joel defied orders to stay to the ground and risked his life to help the many wounded soldiers; nearly every soldier in the lead squad was either wounded or killed in the battle. Even after being shot twice (once in the right thigh and once in the right calf), Joel continued to do his job; he bandaged his wounds and continued to help the wounded in not only his unit, but in the nearby company as well. When his medical supplies were depleted, he hobbled around the battlefield for more, using a makeshift crutch while SP4 Randy Eickhoff ran ahead of him and provided covering fire. Eickhoff was later awarded the Silver Star and Purple Heart for his actions. Joel attended to thirteen troops and saved the life of one soldier who had a severe chest wound by improvising and placing a plastic bag over the soldier's chest in order to seal the wound until the supplies were refreshed. After the firefight which lasted over twenty-four hours, Joel was hospitalized and shipped to locations including Saigon and Tokyo to recover. Shortly after, he received the Silver Star for his activities. Medal of Honor citation On March 9, 1967, on the White House lawn, President Lyndon Johnson presented Joel with the Medal of Honor for his service in the Vietnam War. His citation reads as follows: > For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and > beyond the call of duty. SP6 Joel demonstrated indomitable courage, > determination, and professional skill when a numerically superior and well- > concealed Viet Cong element launched a vicious attack which wounded or > killed nearly every man in the lead squad of the company. After treating the > men wounded by the initial burst of gunfire, he bravely moved forward to > assist others who were wounded while proceeding to their objective. While > moving from man to man, he was struck in the right leg by machine gun fire. > Although painfully wounded his desire to aid his fellow soldiers transcended > all personal feeling. He bandaged his own wound and self-administered > morphine to deaden the pain enabling him to continue his dangerous > undertaking. Through this period of time, he constantly shouted words of > encouragement to all around him. Then, completely ignoring the warnings of > others, and his pain, he continued his search for wounded, exposing himself > to hostile fire; and, as bullets dug up the dirt around him, he held plasma > bottles high while kneeling completely engrossed in his life saving mission. > Then, after being struck a second time and with a bullet lodged in his > thigh, he dragged himself over the battlefield and succeeded in treating 13 > more men before his medical supplies ran out.

Winston-Salem parade On April 8, 1967, Winston-Salem held a parade, the first time the city had ever held a military parade to recognize a single individual, to honor Lawrence Joel. He grew up on the east side of the city, a predominantly African-American section of Winston-Salem at the time. The New York Times called it the biggest tribute the city had ever staged.Watch WFMY News 2 vintage video of the parade. Retirement Lawrence Joel retired from military service in 1973. On February 4, 1984, Joel died of complications from diabetes. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Section 46, lot 15-1, adjacent to the Memorial Amphitheater.Arlington National Cemetery Honors and awards The first military memorial named in his honor was Joel Drive, which encircles Blanchfield Community Hospital at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, dedicated in 1985. In memory of Lawrence Joel and all Forsyth County veterans, the Winston-Salem Board of Aldermen (now City Council) in February 1986 decided to name the city's new coliseum the Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Construction for the coliseum began one year later and opened in 1989. In 2007, a study funded by the Winston-Salem City Council opened the possibility of selling the coliseum's naming rights to some corporation.Winston-Salem Journal Jan 27, 2007: By any other name, it could be $10 million sweeter The Joel Auditorium at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. is named after Lawrence Joel.

The name Baƒßrija means moth in Maltese. It is also known in English as Baƒßria, of which the Counts Moscati had owned the fiefdom that was granted by the Grand Master of Malta. Overview Two churches are present in Baƒßrija, an old one (which was re-inaugurated on Saturday 19 October 2013), and the newer church, built in 1984, which is dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours and which is currently in use. The main feast in Baƒßrija is that of Saint Martin of Tours, which is celebrated annually on 11 November. This feast is associated with an old tradition where a bag full of an assortment of nuts, sweets and fresh fruit is given to young children on the day. Another tradition present exclusively in Baƒßrija is the annual fair which is held on the Sunday before the feast, where an assortment of goods are given away in a number of lotteries. Baƒßrija is also famous for its rabbit cooking restaurants. Bahrija is one of the highest places in Malta, therefore the weather here is cooler than that of the lower land (it is also exposed to the cold northern winds coming over the sea). Most of the north of Malta is visible from this village, but the south west of Gozo (including Xlendi) is also visible, and on clear still nights, a line of street lights is visible on the horizon to the north, where Sicily is. Although Bahrija has little rich soil, much of its land is used for agriculture, mostly growing grape vines and other common fruit that can withstand the harsh heat of the summer and the lack of soil. Bahrija is a good place to search for walks. For a cliff climb, there is the Fomm ir-Rih walk, or for Maltese heritage, the Victoria lines start at Kuncizzjoni.

Background His mother was executed in a Nazi concentration camp during the Second World War. While on the verge of embarking on a promising stage career at twenty years of age, Lebovici's father died, leaving him orphaned. Out of the necessity to ensure a source of income for himself more secure than acting, he followed his father into a menial occupation. However, passion for show-business caught up with him and in 1960, he founded a management agency with Michele Meritz through which he represented the interests of Jean-Pierre Cassel. Subsequently, during the 1960s, he rapidly rose to prominence in show business by dint of his distinguished business acumen and an intuitive understanding of the film industry. In 1965, he bought a management agency from Andre Bernheim which included among its clients the French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo. He gradually created an empire in the cinema industry which lasted until 1972, with his creation of Artm√©dia, the first pan-European agency managing a combination of writers, directors and actors. Clients included Bertrand de Labbey, Jean-Louis Livi and Serge Rousseau (who was to discover a new generation of French stars at the beginning of the 1970s, such as Patrick Dewaere, Coluche, Miou-Miou and Jacques Villeret). Parallel to his activities in business, G√©rard Lebovici acquired a sulfurous reputation through his political associations. Scarcely politicized in his youth, although of mildly Left-wing sympathies, his future wife Floriana Chiampo, as well as the events of May 1968, radicalised him. Lebovici was fascinated by the Paris uprisings and seems to have viewed them as the birth of a true revolution. He is said to have confided to his friend G√©rard Gu√©gan the idea of founding a radical publishing house which he intended to be the \\"Gallimard of the revolution\\". This idea materialised in 1969 under the name of Editions Champ Libre. Champ Libre published a broad range of texts which reflected the ideological confusion of the time, as well as the growing influence of the American counter-culture. The defining moment of Champ Libre's development came in 1971 when Guy Debord submitted \\"The Society of the Spectacle\\" for publication. In 1974, Lebovici decided to move Editions Champ Libre even more towards the fringes of the publishing industry. Debord acquired a growing influence over the choice of publication of certain titles (Clausewitz, Baltasar Gracian, Jorge Manrique, poets of the T'ang Dynasty, Omar Kayyam, but also Jaime Sempr√∫n, Jean-Louis Moinet and others) while the marketing policy of the house broke with normal standards: there were no paperback editions of bestsellers, and no contact with the press. Champ Libre also republished some classic revolutionary tracts as well as writers dissenting from Stalinism (Marx, Bakunin, Landauer, Korsch, Ciliga, Souvarine, George Orwell). Lebovici also continued his work in film, financing three films by Debord of which \\"Society of the Spectacle\\" was the first, in 1973. Ten years later, Lebovici bought the Studio Cujas cinema in the Paris Latin Quarter and devoted it exclusively to showing Debord's films. The unlimited friendship between the two men, apparently belied by all lack of similarity besides their respective age, provoked jealousy even among the close associates of Lebovici. In addition to his taste for political circles of the far left, Lebovici had an extreme fascination for the culture of the criminal classes. He adopted the daughter, Sabrina, of France's \\"public enemy n¬∞ 1\\" at the time, the bank robber Jacques Mesrine, who was killed in 1979 by the French police. Pierre Guillaume approached Lebovici, in 1979, with a proposal to publish the Holocaust Denial text Le Mensonge d'Ulysse by Paul Rassinier. He refused.La Vieille Taupe Death On March 7, 1984, G√©rard Lebovici was found shot dead in the front seat of his car in the basement of the Avenue Foch carpark in Paris. There was swift confirmation that he had died on March 5 from four bullets fired from behind into the back of the neck. The assassins have never been caught. His wife Floriana took control of Editions Champ Libre, renaming it Editions G√©rard Lebovici and opening a bookshop of the same name in the rue Saint Sulpice, Paris. She died of cancer in February 1990 and the bookshop closed shortly after with the stock transferring to √âditions Ivrea, rue du Sommerard.

Roche and built by Aeronca Aircraft. Development=Roche Monoplane Jean A. Roche was a U.S. Army engineer at McCook Field airfield in Dayton, Ohio. Roche developed an aircraft with automatic stability and was granted U. S. Patent No. 1,085,461. Roche published his engineering ideas for the aircraft in Aerial Age Weekly and Slipstream Monthly magazines. The prototype was started in Ohio in 1923 with the assistance of fellow engineer Quinten Dohse. The aircraft used a triangular cross-section welded steel tube fuselage, with wood wings, was fabric-covered, and used wire bracing throughout. A Henderson engine was installed, but did not perform well. Next a custom 29 hp two- cylinder Morehouse engine was developed for the aircraft. On September 1, 1925, the aircraft was successfully test flown. Many pilots including Jimmy Doolittle tried out the aircraft. Wright Aeronautical hired Morehouse and rights to his Wright-Morehouse WM-80 engine. Left without an engine, They turned to Robert E. Galloway of the Aeronautical Corporation of America to use the Aeronca E-107 engine. The rights to the aircraft were sold to Aeronca in 1928 as the basis for the C-2 Design. Aeronca C-2 The Aeronca C-2, powered by a tiny two-cylinder engine, made its first flight in OctoberPayne, Stephen, ed. Canadian Wings (Douglas & McIntyre, Ltd., 2006), p.163. 1929, with its public debut in St. Louis in February 1930. It was flying at its most basic‚Äîthe pilot sat on a bare plywood board. The C-2 featured an unusual, almost frivolous design with an open-pod fuselage that inspired its nickname, The Flying Bathtub. (It was also nicknamed \\"Airknocker\\" and \\"Razorback\\".) The general design of the C-2 could have been inspired by Jean Roche's initial flight experiences with an American-built copy of the Santos-Dumont Demoiselle, which had a similar triangular \\"basic\\" fuselage cross-section, and wire-spoked main landing gear wheels against the fuselage sides. Equipped with only four instruments (altimeter, oil temperature, oil pressure, and tachometer), a stick, and rudder pedals (brakes and a heater at extra cost), the C-2 was priced at a low $1,555 (later US$1,245), bringing the cost of flying down to a level that a private citizen could perhaps reach. Aeronca sold 164 of the economical C-2s at the height of the Great Depression in 1930-1931, helping to spark the growth of private aviation in the United States. The Aeronca C-2 also holds the distinction of being the first aircraft to be refueled from a moving automobile. A can of gasoline was handed up from a speeding Austin automobile to a C-2 pilot, (who hooked it with a wooden cane) during a 1930 air show in California. A seaplane version of the C-2 was also offered, designated the PC-2 and PC-3 (\\"P\\" for pontoon) with floats replacing the wheeled landing gear. A single Aeronca C-2 was converted to a glider by H.J. Parham in England after an inflight engine failure and forced landing. The nose was faired in after the removal of the engine. It first flew as a glider 15 May 1937 and went to the Dorset Glider Club but was destroyed in the club hangar during a storm in November 1938.

Original draft circa 1850s. Jane Booth, 1825‚Äì1895George Pirie (1799‚Äì1870) was a Canadian newspaper publisher. He emigrated to Canada from Aberdeen, Scotland. His father, also George Pirie, was a prominent Aberdeen merchant and ship owner. His mother was Katherine (Catherine) Mitchell Pirie, a daughter of the Rev. Thomas Mitchell, of the parish of Tarves, Aberdeenshire. He was educated in Scotland and in London, where he was apprenticed to his relative, Sir John Pirie, at one time the Lord Mayor of London.Burrows, C. A. (1877), The annals of the town of Guelph, 1827‚Äì1877. Guelph, Ontario: Herald steam printing house, p. 147. Mr. Pirie and his first wife, Mary Robieson, and their children, arrived in Canada in 1838. They settled in a Scottish settlement named Bon Accord after the town motto of Aberdeen. This settlement was located in Upper Nichol Township near present-day Elora. The transition to Canadian pioneer life was much more difficult than had been anticipated during the planning stages in Scotland. Mr. Pirie's wife died a few years later and was one of the earliest burials from the settlement.Mary Robieson was buried at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Fergus, Ont. The Pirie's, formerly residents of downtown Aberdeen,Katharine Mitchell Pirie's address was 50 Castle Street, Aberdeen, as stated on her 1837 funeral notice. According to Pigot's 1837 Directory of Aberdeenshire, 50 Castle Street was known as \\"Pirie's Court\\". Pigot's 1837 Directory of Aberdeenshire had no prior experience with farming. Mr. Pirie decided to abandon farming and purchase a newspaper. In 1848, he took over the two-year-old Guelph Herald and moved with his family to downtown Guelph. The printing and publishing office for the Herald was on Wyndham Street. The paper was printed once weekly and the office covered job printing and issued marriage licenses. Mr. Pirie's correspondence to his eldest son George Mitchell Pirie detailed his struggles to make the newspaper profitable and collect payment for advertisements and subscriptions. He also faced lawsuits over content. They were often short staffed with his son, Alexander Fraser Pirie, running the Washington Press, and his second wife, Jane Booth (1825‚Äì95), at work in the office ‚Äì \\"...Mamma is run off her feet\\". Another son, Charles Napier Pirie, worked at the paper, and other children may have assisted. During this time his priority was to pay his staff and in one letter to his son he wrote that they were now dangerously low in candles. In many cases he asked his son to search for potential advertisers in Hamilton, or chase after missed payments. In one case his son suggested that Mr. Pirie might attempt to take some work on the Canadian census to help make ends meet. The sale of his original farm Maryville was also a headache. His son arranged for the sale but the new landowner felt that he had overpaid and that the land was impossible to work and unprofitable. Mr. Pirie was a poet, and was remembered as one of Canada's Scottish Canadian poets in a 1900 book published in Toronto by the Caledonia Society. His poetry generally dealt with Canadian patriotism, and social issues such as poverty, and temperance. One of his best known poems was \\"The Volunteers of Canada\\". He also tackled contemporary issues such as Louis Riel in his poem entitled: \\"The Murder of Thomas Scott\\".Thomas Scott (Orangeman) He wrote on the Fenian Raids, the difficulties faced by new immigrants, the exploitation of textile workers, and Scottish history. His private and unpublished papers included some romantic poems, and poems relating to death and mourning. A selection of his poems were published in pamphlet form by the Guelph Herald as \\"Lyrics of the Late George Pirie, Esq.\\"Pirie, G. (1870), Lyrics of the Late George Pirie, Esq. Guelph, Ontario: Guelph Herald. Much of his writing was lost in a house fire, although a booklet of handwritten unpublished poetry, primarily romantic, has been preserved. His poetry in some cases reflected the particular experience of the displaced Scotsman in Canada: > Far from Clan Alpine Dhu, > Wanders the bonnet blue; > Still to that magnet true, > Turns his heart thither. > Far though his fate may part, > Land of his love thou art, > Ever the Scottish heart > Warms to the heather.'' As to his writing ability, the following statement appeared in Selections from Scottish Canadian Poetry (1900): \\"William Lyon Mackenzie, a Scotsman like himself, although opposed to him in politics, said of him that he was one of the ablest writers in Canada.\\"Caledonian Society of Toronto (1900), Selections from Scottish Canadian poets. Toronto, Ontario: Caledonian Society, p. 129. Mr. Pirie' Canadian patriotism was evident not only in his poetry: > So enthusiastic was his patriotism, that at the time of the Trent Affair > (1861) though then a feeble old man, he gallantly joined the Scottish > company formed in the town at that time, and drilled night after night, to > be able to take his place among his country's defenders.Burrows, 147‚Äì148 Mr. Pirie was particularly close to his son George Mitchell Pirie. The younger Pirie was a merchant in Dundas, Ontario.George Mitchell Pirie and his wife Margaret Ann Booth had lived at 9 Foundry Street in Dundas. This historic circa 1840s homestead was demolished some time after October 1977 for redevelopment as a parking lot, despite protests of local heritage groups and surviving relatives (Dundas Journal ‚Äì 5 October 1977). Mr. G. M. Pirie assisted Mr. Pirie on many business matters including the sale of his Bon Accord farm, and following up on newspaper advertising clients in the Dundas and Hamilton area. The correspondence between father and son are preserved today in the form of about 20 letters. By November 1869, Mr. Pirie was quite ill due to complications from severe asthma. He felt that he had first acquired the condition in 1819 during a visit to the island of Anticosti after which he had his first attack. After that he was often ill ‚Äì \\"...it was long a matter of wonder how he bore up so well under his affliction.\\"Burrows, 147 He continued to write for the newspaper until just 3 weeks before his death. His correspondence was as frequent and as clear as ever and he was busily conducting his business affairs up to his last days through numerous letters to his son in Dundas, Ontario. His funeral was described as \\"...one of the most mournful sights ever seen in Guelph, nearly all the inhabitants wearing crape...\\"Burrows, 148 His obituary in the Guelph Herald\\"Obituary ‚Äì George Pirie\\", Guelph Herald, 27 July 1870. included the following statement about Mr. Pirie's character: > \\"Although ever ready to assist the poor emigrant or wayfarer, no matter what > his nationality might be, he loved his native land and his \\"brither Scots\\" > with a love which was unquenchable. We have often, when speaking of his > native land and its dearly cherished associations, seen his lips quiver, and > the tear start in his eye, as with faltering accents he recounted its > history, dwelt lovingly on its scenery, or recalled his youthful days spent > there, with all their fondly remembered reminiscences.\\"Pirie 1870 Mr. Pirie has numerous descendants across Canada, the United States, England, Australia, New Zealand, and Costa Rica. He is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery (formerly Union Cemetery) in Guelph, Ontario, and his grave is one of the earlier burials.

But because of this, she thinks that she isn't special or talented. Yet Edwina has many talents including leadership, singing and advising, and she combines all of them by directing a weekly mini-musical out of her garage. The topic of these musicals is letters written to her by neighborhood kids who need advice. She gives them advice through songs and dances that she orchestrates with her friends. One of the main themes of Dear Edwina is Edwina's desire to be in the \\"Advice-a-palooza\\" festival because she feels it will prove that she is as talented as her siblings. This is all going on while Edwina's love interest, Scott, is trying to win her over. But, since Edwina is so concerned about her show, she doesn't care about Scott. Scott wins her heart by singing her a seductive love ballad as an impromptu performance on the show. The talent scout calls, and asks for Scott to perform at the festival, not Edwina. She is heartbroken when she runs into Katie Spoonapple, who has just run away from the Summer Math Olympics because she was getting made fun of by the other girls. She tells Katie not to listen to those kids, and to do what you love to do. Katie hugs her, and Edwina realizes that love is far more important than getting a prize.

Through the protectorate, France attempted to control the foreign affairs of the Kingdom of Imerina through its representative at Antananarivo. France declared the island a protectorate in 1882 after reaching an agreement with Britain, which had been the first European power to establish a lasting influence and presence on the island that dated back to the arrival of London Missionary Society missionaries around 1820; Britain agreed to sanction French claims to Madagascar in exchange for French recognition of its claims to Zanzibar. The French justified the establishment of a protectorate on the basis of land claims over outlying islands like Nosy Be and Nosy Boraha and a treaty signed with a local leader of the western coastal Sakalava people. It was further justified through documents signed by King Radama II, including a letter he was possibly tricked into signing that entreated Napoleon III to support a coup d'√©tat against Ranavalona I, and land ownership agreements with French industrialist Joseph-Fran√ßois Lambert that were revoked upon Radama's assassination in 1863. It ended in 1897 as Madagascar became a French colony. Successive sovereigns Ranavalona II and Ranavalona III and their Prime Minister, Rainilaiarivony, rejected the claim of French protectorate status and consistently refused to acknowledge the French representative or submit to the demands of the French, who attempted to impose control over Madagascar's foreign affairs and trade. The Malagasy government sent letters to foreign trade and diplomatic allies, including Britain and the United States, to request they advocate to France on behalf of Madagascar for continued Malagasy independence. France engaged Madagascar diplomatically and bombarded coastal cities in an attempt to enforce its claims, but Madagascar continued to govern its affairs with relatively little interference. As a result, a French expeditionary force occupied Antananarivo in September 1895 and imprisoned the queen and prime minister. In January 1897 France declared Madagascar a French colony and deported the prime minister to Algeria, where he died shortly afterward. A civil governor was put in place and key opposition figures were imprisoned or executed. The queen was allowed to continue managing certain internal affairs as a figurehead. A popular resistance movement, called the Menalamba rebellion, arose in response to the perceived corruption and ineffectiveness of the monarchy, growing European presence and influence on the island, and the spread of Christianity. After violently quelling the rebellion in 1897, the French executed key members of the royal family and sent the queen into exile first in R√©union and later Algeria, where she died in 1917.

Otto Tucker, (October 4, 1923 ‚Äì October 6, 2015) was a Newfoundland and Labrador heritage activist, storyteller, and educator. He was a recipient of the Order of Canada for his work in promoting and preserving Newfoundland and Labrador heritage and the Order of Newfoundland and Labrador for his efforts that have made significant contributions to both the educational and cultural sectors of the province.  Early Life  Otto Tucker was born in Winterton, Trinity Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada to John and Clara (n√©e Pitcher) Tucker. His father fished during the summer, and migrated to the New England states during the winter to work as a carpenter. He had one sister, Florence. His mother was a Salvation Army officer who resigned from officership before her children were born, but encouraged them to pursue the faith. Tucker played cornet in the Salvation Army Corp's brass band beginning at a very early age.  Family Life  Tucker married Ruby Perry of Botwood, Newfoundland and Labrador on Tuesday, July 12, 1955 at the Salvation Army Citadel in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. They have two sons, William (Bill) and Craig.  Education  In 1942, after finishing grade 11, Tucker attended six weeks at the Summer School Teacher Training Program at Memorial College. Upon completion of this training program, he was awarded a Third Grade Teaching Certificate by the Newfoundland Department of Education. He graduated from Memorial University of Newfoundland with a Bachelor of Arts in Education in 1955. He received a master's degree in Education from the University of Alberta in 1963 and a doctorate in Education from the University of Toronto in 1967. During his time at the University of Toronto, he organized the first Graduate Students Association in Education and was elected as president of the association.

In 1984, he co-founded the Wessex Society of Newfoundland, serving as its president for 22 years. The association is dedicated to promoting Newfoundland and Labrador's ties to the West Country of England. His enthusiasm for this subject led to the creation of a sister Wessex Society in Dorset, England.  Awards  In 1997, Tucker received an Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree (L.L.D.) from Memorial University. In 1999, he was made an Honorary Member of the Newfoundland and Labrador Teacher's Association.

Club nights ran regularly on Thursdays from 1993 until 1996, being the focus of much of the Zippie movement. The club and its related activities also helped to popularise ideas such as cyberculture and the Internet between those years. History and venues The club first started at The Marquee in London when it was at 105 Charing Cross Road. Promoted by evolution / dream, and at first as a collaboration with Tribal Energy on Thursday nights in June 1993. The club hosted a lecture by Terence McKenna on its opening night. with DJ's, Sequenci, Tribal Energy (Jez Turner), Solar Quest and Mixmaster Morris and featured an \\"ambient space\\" in the foyer and a \\"smart bar\\" on the terrace which sold various herbal drinks. With techno music playing, about 150 people attended. The club ran weekly. After eight weeks, a disagreement between the Tribal Energy and Evolution / dream crews led to a split. Tribal Energy then continued at the Marquee with a club on the same night, called 'Metropolis', which ran for seven weeks before closing. The Evolution / dream crew consolidated and grew at the so-called Stansted Tree Party in September 1993 ‚Äì a protest event to prevent woods near Stansted Airport in Essex being cleared to make way for housing development. On 21 October 1993, the Heaven nightclub under Charing Cross railway station became home to the club. 4,000 people attended for the free opening night. Heaven was London's original gay-only nightclub, but had run non-gay (known as Pyramid) nights for many years, including clubs such as Rage, Earth, Spectrum and Land of Oz. The club had the distinction of being full or almost full for every night of its 155-week run at Heaven. The Megatripolis 'Festival in a box' on Thursday nights attracted a diverse audience from a wide age range, many of whom would not otherwise have considered going clubbing. By early 1994, it had also taken over the adjoining Sound Shaft nightclub and turned it into an ambient space with frequent all-night sets by Mixmaster Morris on the club's fourth separate sound stage. The club had many resident DJ's from across the broad spectrum of London's underground music scene. Megatripolis also promoted several large parties at Bagley's in Kings Cross and escalated its political agenda by renting an armoured car for the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill protest rally in July 1994. A three-CD album representing the club's music was released in July 1996 on Funky Peace Productions 2000 featuring mixes by DJ regulars and packaged in hemp (tree-free) paper. All production equipment owned by the club was distributed to members of the club's crew. The rented premises under St.Pancras station were handed over to what was to become \\"Escape from Samsara\\", a club formed by some of the original Megatripolis crew which went on to run weekly Friday nights for 7 years at The Fridge in Brixton. A Megatripolis event was also staged at the Hacienda in Manchester, and several times at The Rocket in North London with Energique. Culture and events Megatripolis proved popular, although some reporting of it suggested a conflict between an avowed downplay of psychedelic drugs and an enthusiasm for substance use by some club-goers.BBC Two \\"yoof\\" DEF II news programme Reportage, Reportage on Megatripolis In any event, the club provided a meeting place of like-minded people and served as a platform for social awareness and activism as well as more traditional nightclub fare. Typical evenings combined lectures and workshops with live musical performances accompanied by live video mixing and theatre. Musical styles were diverse, and included progressive house, trance, deep house, minimal techno and dub. The club played a seminal role in promoting trance music. Visits from speakers such as Allen Ginsberg, Terence McKenna, George Monbiot, Howard Marks and Ram Dass were common. Ginsberg's 1995 appearance was made into the film Allen Ginsberg Live in London. Guest DJs included James Monro, Colin Faver, Colin Dale, Alex Paterson, Andrew Weatherall, Mr. C, Tsuyoshi Suzuki, Youth, and many others, but also featured nights when Flying Rhino, Juno Reactor, Zero Gravity, Liberator and others took over the main dance floor which was the birth of Psychedelic Trance, the upgrade of Goa Trance and Tripship, Sugarlump, Slack and others. The club's resident DJ's were Darius Akashic, Sequenci, Richard Grey, and Marco Arnaldi. at least one of them was on the main dance floor every week. Marcus Pennell was resident VJ. Atmospheric music combined with sound effects was played along to films in the \\"chill-out rooms\\" set apart from the dance floors. New-age stalls occupied the central hallway selling non-alcoholic energy (or \\"smart\\") drinks, body jewellery, alternative \\"small press\\" comics and magazines (such as the short-lived, but influential Head Magazine), as well as T-shirts and other clothing. The club also encouraged face and body painters, massage therapists, healers and magicians. Also notable were early demonstrations of the World Wide Web at a time when most patrons were just beginning to be aware of what was then termed cyberculture, something seen as an important, if not defining, part of the Zippie future. Underground bulletin boards such as London's pHreak hosted live \\"cyber events\\" from the club. In what was seen as very progressive at the time, a live video interview with Arthur C Clarke was conducted from his home in Sri LankaVideo clip Sir Arthur C Clarke from Sri Lanka ‚Äì as above on a portable satellite phone system. Similarly, Timothy Leary was transmitted into the club via ISDN giving a video interview from his home in the Los Angeles hills, ISDN having been installed at his house for the link. Leary had been banned from entering the UK in person by the British government in the 1960s, a ban that was still in force at the time. The Dalai Lama also gave a lecture at the club from the Barbican via ISDN on Thursday 18 July 1996. Environmental issues were an important part of the club's remit and another part of the Zippie agenda. Anti-road protests were advertised on its internal noticeboards, hemp fashion shows were staged, environmental lectures and debates took place in the talk room called \\"The Well\\", and bicycle-powered sound-systems played on several occasions in various rooms.Disco divas turn the tables, Guardian, 24 August 1999 megatripolis was the key mover in climate change promotion from this time. A UK tour took place in the spring / summer of 1996 including venues such as the Hacienda, Manchester, Junction, Cambridge, and others. Two gigs were also held at the Mad club in Athens, Greece in 1996. Megatripolis West An offshoot of the club was started by Fraser Clark and others, in San Francisco in late 1994. It ran for five consecutive weeks before closing. The sixth and final night of the club was a \\"launch rave\\" hosted by Ronin Publishing for Timothy Leary's book Chaos And Cyber Culture. In true \\"illegal UK rave\\" tradition, patrons were given the event's location at a nearby burger joint. Leary jammed and performed jazz skat with famous Bay Area musician Maruga. He was later kidnapped by the Zippie Soundsystem and forced to release a statement condemning the UK Prime Minister John Major and the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which famously banned outdoor parties with music that included an \\"emission of a succession of repetitive beats\\". Leary exerted a powerful influence over the philosophy of the club and the Zippie movement overall. An indication of this can be found in the introduction to his posthumous book The Fugitive Philosopher (Ronin Press, September 2007) written by Fraser Clark. The original title of the piece, published in Clark's online magazine the UP!, was Timothy Leary Was A Saint Who Will Be Remembered & Celebrated Long After Jesus, Mohamed and Elvis Are Forgotten Megatripolis in popular culture Megatripolis is referenced in the BBC TV comedy 'Absolutely Fabulous', and on the Red Hot Chili Peppers album 'Stadium Arcadium'. Well-known people who attended the club as visitors included Malcolm McLaren, Lynne Franks, The Pet Shop Boys, Bj√∂rk, Heather Small, and Richard Branson. Megatripolis Reunion Benefit for Fraser Clark In 2008 Fraser Clark announced that he had inoperable liver cancer. In farewell to him, a final Megatripolis was held at Heaven on 13 November.

Follicular units also contain sebaceous (oil) glands, nerves, a small muscle, and occasional fine vellus hairs. In follicular unit transplantation, these small units allow the surgeon to safely transplant thousands of grafts in a single session, which maximizes the cosmetic impact of the procedure.Orentreich N: Autografts in alopecias and other selected dermatological conditions. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 83:463-479, 1959. FUT is considered an advance over older hair transplantation procedures that used larger grafts and often produced a pluggy, unnatural look. In a properly-performed follicular unit transplant, the results will mimic the way hair grows in nature and will be undetectable as a hair transplant. In recent history, FUT had been the most common procedure for hair restoration. As of 2017, the newer follicular unit extraction aka FUE procedure has become the most common procedure. http://www.ishrs.org/statistics-research.htm Key concepts Follicular unit transplantation uses follicular units to accomplish a number of objectives critical to the hair restoration process: Maximizing hair transplant growth Since the follicular unit is a distinct anatomic and physiologic entity, preserving it intact during the graft dissection is felt to maximize growth. In FUT, after hair is removed from the back of the scalp in a single strip, stereo-microscopic dissection allows the individual follicular units to be removed from this strip without being damaged.Bernstein RM, Rassman WR: Follicular Unit Transplantation: 2005, Issue on Advanced Cosmetic Surgery. Dermatologic Clinics 2005; 23(3): 393-414. In the older mini-micrografting techniques, hair was harvested in multiple strips with the follicular units in each strip edge showing damage from the harvesting blades. The strips were then cut into smaller pieces, a process that would break up follicular units and risk additional damage to the follicles. Ensuring the naturalness of hair transplant Follicular Unit Transplantation enables the hair transplant to look natural both at the individual follicular unit level and in regards to the overall graft distribution. Since scalp hair normally grows in follicular units of 1 to 4 hairs, the exclusive use of these naturally-occurring units in FUT ensures that each graft will be identical to the surrounding follicular units. Thus, when the transplanted follicular units grow hair after a transplant, the overall results of the transplant will appear natural. Additionally, by using individual follicular units, rather than larger grafts, the surgeon has a greater total number of grafts with which to work. This allows the surgeon to distribute the grafts more evenly over the scalp for a more natural overall distribution of hair. Ease of surgical planning The density of naturally-occurring follicular units in a normal scalp is relatively constant, measured at approximately 1 unit per mm2.Limmer BL. Elliptical donor stereoscopically assisted micrografting as an approach to further refinement in hair transplantation. Dermatol Surg 1994;20:789-793. This helps in the planning of a hair transplant in two ways: # The hair transplant surgeon can accurately estimate the number of follicular grafts that can be obtained from dissecting a donor strip of a given size. # The same number of follicular units can be used to cover a specific size bald area regardless of the patient's actual hair density. In patients with high hair density, there are usually a sufficient number of follicular units in the donor area to accomplish the patient's goals. However, in the patient with low hair density, a compromise must be made, and this is guided by the follicular unit constant. By transplanting a patient with low hair density using the same number and spacing of follicular units as in a patient with high density, the transplant surgeon will produce a thinner look, but will allow proper conservation of donor hair for future procedures.Seager D. Binocular stereoscopic dissecting microscopes: should we use them? Hair Transplant Forum Int 1996; 6(4): 2-5. Minimizing trauma to the scalp The key to a natural appearing hair transplant is to have the hair emerge from perfectly normal skin, so minimizing trauma to the scalp is an important aspect of follicular unit transplantation. This can be accomplished by trimming away the excess tissue around the follicular units and then inserting them into small recipient sites on the patient's scalp. Follicular units are relatively compact structures, but are surrounded by substantial amounts of non-hair bearing skin. This extra tissue can be removed without injuring the follicles, using stereo-microscopic dissection. These small, trimmed, follicular unit grafts can then be placed into tiny incisions in the patient's scalp; thereby minimizing damage to the scalp's connective tissue and blood supply. In contrast; the larger wounds produced by mini-micrografting and plug transplants caused cosmetic problems that included dimpling and pigment changes in the skin; depression or elevation of the grafts; and a thinned, shiny look to the scalp. These problems can be avoided using very small grafts and very small recipient wounds. Another advantage of making small recipient wounds is the ability to create a \\"snug fit\\" for the follicular unit grafts. Unlike the punch grafts and some mini-grafting techniques; each of which removes a small bit of tissue in the recipient area; the trimmed follicular unit grafts used in FUT fit into small, needle-made incisions without any need for removing tissue. This preserves the elasticity of the scalp and holds the tiny grafts snugly in place. After surgery, the snug fit facilitates wound healing and helps to ensure that the grafts will get enough oxygen from the surrounding tissue in order to maximize their survival. Ability to perform large hair transplant sessions There are four reasons why the follicular unit transplantation procedure allows a hair transplant surgeon to transplant large numbers of grafts in each session: # The hair restoration can be completed quickly so that the patient has minimal interference with his/her lifestyle, # A larger number of grafts can compensate for the shedding that frequently accompanies a hair transplant, called telogen effluvium, # Using large numbers of grafts in each session preserves the donor supply by reducing the number of times incisions are made in the donor area, # Extracting large numbers of grafts provides sufficient 1- and 2-hair grafts to create a soft frontal hairline and enough 3- and 4- hair grafts to give the patient the fullest possible look.

Summary Knightwatch centers around the activities of the \\"Knights of the City\\", a volunteer group set up to assist law enforcement. It was largely made up of ex-gang members (and was modeled after a similar real-life group, the Guardian Angels); the program focused on its charismatic leader, Tony Maldonado (Benjamin Bratt). Operating out of donated space in the basement of a church, the group practiced martial arts and other unarmed techniques since they were not commissioned police officers and did not use firearms. Keeping young people with violent pasts from reverting to this pattern in their new-found calling was a constant challenge to Tony, as were the interpersonal relationships constantly developing among his young colleagues. Knightwatch was a Nielsen ratings failure. It struggled in its timeslot, airing against NBC's The Cosby Show and A Different World and CBS's 48 Hours. It was cancelled after 3 months on the air.

It was originally part of the ancient Forest of Middlesex which covered much of London, Hertfordshire and Essex and was mentioned in the Domesday Book. It is now one of three Local Nature Reserves in the London Borough of Haringey. It is situated a few minutes' walk from Highgate tube station. Haringey contains four ancient woods. These are Highgate Wood, Queen's Wood, Coldfall Wood and Bluebell Wood. All are shown on John Rocque's 1754 Map of Middlesex. Queen's Wood was once called Churchyard Bottom Wood, and was originally part of the Great Forest of Middlesex. It was said to be the site of a plague pit. In 1898 it was purchased from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners by Hornsey Urban District Council, opened to the public by Princess Helena, Duchess of Albany, and renamed Queen's Wood in honour of Queen Victoria. The wood is an ancient oak-hornbeam woodland, which features English oak and occasional beech which provide a canopy above cherry, field maple, hazel, holly, hornbeam, midland hawthorn, mountain ash and both species of lowland birch. The scarce Wild Service Tree (which is evidence of the Woods's ancient origin) is scattered throughout the wood. The Wood has a small adventure playground, but no park or playing fields, and has never been subjected to intensive management of the type practised at Highgate Wood and accordingly there is greater diversity of flora and fauna - Bantock (1984) found a significantly greater number of ground feeding birds present in the Wood when compared to Highgate Wood, which he attributed to the greater structural diversity and denser shrub layer present. Queen's Wood is a Local Nature Reserve and a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation. The ground flora is particularly rich given its proximity to central London (the wood is within a six-mile radius of Charing Cross railway station). It includes a large population of wood anemone, goldilocks buttercup and wood sorrel, yellow pimpernel and square- stemmed St John's wort. A survey conducted in 1984 noted 39 distinct herbaceous species and 15 different grasses native to the wood, in addition to some 23 species of tree and shrub. A small paddling pool which had fallen into disuse has been converted into a pond with wild aquatic plants. This was with the assistance of the Friends of Queens Wood society. Despite fairly high levels of disturbance, the bird life is diverse and includes three species of woodpecker. Over one hundred species of spiders have been spotted and a nationally rare jewel beetle is widespread.

In his career, he pitched for the Houston Astros and the Colorado Rockies. He stands at 6' 8\\" and weighs . He batted and threw right-handed. He threw a two-seam fastball, a four-seam fastball, a slider, and a changeup. Hirsh was not highly recruited out of high school, but after attending California Lutheran University, he was drafted by the Houston Astros in the second round of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft. From 2005‚Äì06, Hirsh won the Double-A Texas League Pitcher of the Year Award and the Triple-A Pacific Coast League Pitcher of the Year Award in successive seasons, as he went a combined 26‚Äì10 with 283 strikeouts. In 2006, he was called up to the major leagues for the first time, and he appeared in nine games with the Astros. During the offseason, he was traded to the Colorado Rockies. He was named to the Rockies' starting rotation in 2007 and made a career-high 19 starts before injuries curtailed his season. In 2008, he was limited to four games with the Rockies due to injuries; as it turned out, those would be his last game in the major leagues. He spent the next two season in the minors, getting traded to the New York Yankees (whom he never played in the major leagues with) in 2009. Early and personal life Hirsh was born in Santa Monica, California. His father is Michael Hirsch. The Astros drafted and signed Hirsh's younger brother Matt (6 ft 5 in; 235 lbs.), another Cal Lutheran right-handed pitcher, in the 30th round in 2005. Matt went 1‚Äì2, 5.61, in 2005 at Rookie-level Greeneville. Released by the Astros on June 12, 2006, Matt signed with the St. Louis Cardinals in September 2006. He never pitched in the Cardinals' organization and finished his career with two independent league teams in 2007. Hirsh is Jewish, and he keeps track of all the Jewish players in major league baseball. In 2007, the Rockies had a strong Christian influence in their clubhouse; The New York Times said, \\"Christianity rocks in Colorado's clubhouse.\\" On this, Hirsh said, \\"There are guys who are religious, sure, but they don‚Äôt impress it upon anybody. It‚Äôs not like they hung a cross in my locker or anything. They‚Äôve accepted me for who I am, and what I believe in.\\"Roberts, Selena, \\"Flip-Flopping All the Way to the Other Team,\\" The New York Times, October 28, 2007, accessed July 15, 2009 He married Pamela Clark in 2007. On November 5, 2009, Hirsh and his wife had a baby boy, Brady Antoine Hirsh. High school Hirsh was only 5' 11\\" as a freshman in high school, and failed to make the basketball team, whereupon he decided to focus on baseball. \\"Baseball was it for me,\\" said Hirsh. \\"High school turned out to be one big growth spurt.... All of a sudden I'm 6-foot-8, and people are like, 'What happened to you?'\\" Despite his size by the end of high school, Hirsh drew little interest from scouts out of St. Francis High School of La Ca√±ada, California, because he then threw just 86‚Äì88 mph. He went undrafted when he graduated in 2000, and no NCAA Division I programs wanted him, so he wound up at Division III California Lutheran University, which was only 40 minutes from his house. College Hirsh attended and played baseball at California Lutheran, where he was a 3-year starter, and flashed a fastball and a mid-80s slider. His record was 26‚Äì6, he had a 2.96 earned run average (ERA), and he struck out 238 batters in 258.1 innings pitched. As of 2013, he is tied for first at the university in career wins (26) and holds the record for the most strikeouts in a game (18). He was a First-Team All-SCIAC twice, as well as an ABCA All-West Region First-Team selection in 2003. He was drafted by the Houston Astros with their top pick in the second round (59th overall) of the 2003 amateur entry draft, and signed for a $625,000 signing bonus. Although Hirsh left college after his junior year, he went back after his first minor league season, e-mailing his assignments in from his laptop when he was in the minors to earn a BA in multimedia in 2004. Minor leagues In his pro debut, Hirsh went 3‚Äì1 for the 2003 Tri-City ValleyCats, with a 1.95 ERA, limiting batters to a .175 average, and striking out 33 hitters in innings of work. Following the season, he was rated the No. 8 prospect in the organization by Baseball America. In 2004, he recorded 11 victories with the Single-A advanced Salem Avalanche. 2005: Texas League Pitcher of the Year For a week in January 2005 he worked with Nolan Ryan at Ryan's off-season pitching camp in Houston.

He also earned Texas League post-season All Star honors. Baseball America named Hirsh Houston's top prospect heading into the 2006 season; it also listed Hirsh as having the \\"Best Control\\" in the organization. Before the season, Houston added him to its 40-man roster. \\"He's a very mature kid,\\" Astros assistant general manager Ricky Bennett said. \\"He keeps everything in perspective.\\" With Hirsh in spring training with the major league team, manager Phil Garner summed up his estimation of Hirsh as follows: > \\"He looks to me like he maintains good concentration.

Hirsh was named the 2006 Pacific Coast League Pitcher of the Year, the MLB.com 2006 Triple-A Starting Pitcher of the Year, a Baseball America Triple-A All Star, and was also elected to the post- season 2006 All-PCL squad as the top right-handed starting pitcher in the league.Stephen, Bob, \\"Hirsh turns back the clock as Sky Sox win again,\\" Colorado Springs Gazette, April 27, 2009, accessed August 4, 2009 \\"Needless to say, he's had an excellent season,\\" Round Rock manager Jackie Moore said. \\"He's as consistent from one start to the next as any young pitcher I've been associated with.\\" He was regarded as the top pitching prospect in the Astros' farm system. He was rated by Baseball America as having the best breaking pitch in the PCL, and the league's ninth best prospect. During the 2006 season, Hirsh also kept an on-line journal on MiLB.com. 2008‚Äì13: Rehab and trade to the New York Yankees In 2008, Hirsh tried to work back from his rotator cuff problems and rehab his shoulder after May 30 for the Colorado Springs Sky Sox in the Pacific Coast League. With reduced velocity, he was 4‚Äì4 in 18 games (17 starts), with a 5.80 ERA in 99.1 innings. The slow pace of his recovery made for what Hirsh admitted was \\"a very trying season. I was mentally defeated several times this year.\\"\\"Rockies' Hirsh endures 'trying season': Injured pitcher confident he can return to form,\\" Rocky Mountain News, September 18, 2008, accessed August 3, 2009 He was still not fully recovered when the Rockies recalled him when rosters expanded in September. Hirsh was sent to the minors to begin 2009. He went 6‚Äì7 with a 6.66 ERA in 20 games, 16 of them starts, for Colorado Springs before being traded to the New York Yankees on July 29 for a player to be named later. He was assigned to the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the International League. Yankees manager Joe Girardi said the Yankees got Hirsh to add depth to their rotation. He was 4‚Äì0 for the team in 6 starts, with a 1.35 ERA. Hirsh pitched for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre again in 2010. In early August, he was named International League Pitcher of the Week. He finished 2010 with a 9‚Äì7 record in 19 starts and a 3.90 ERA with 95 strikeouts in innings. After not pitching in 2011 or 2012, Hirsh made one start for the Amarillo Sox of the independent American Association in 2013, allowing three runs in four innings but earning the win. Major leagues=Houston Astros (2006) Hirsh made his major league debut for the Astros on August 12, 2006, allowing four runs in four innings and taking the loss in a 6‚Äì3 defeat to the San Diego Padres. On August 17, he won his first game, allowing three runs in innings in a 7‚Äì3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. In celebration, his teammates doused him with beer in the shower after the game. He started 9 games for the season, posting a 3‚Äì4 record, a 6.04 ERA, 29 strikeouts, and 22 walks in innings. He held batters to a .231 batting average with runners in scoring position. On December 12, the Astros traded Hirsh, Willy Taveras, and Taylor Buchholz to the Colorado Rockies for Rockies pitchers Jason Jennings and Miguel Asencio. Colorado Rockies (2007‚Äì08) In March 2007, Rockies' manager Clint Hurdle designated Hirsh his No. 4 starter. In Hirsh's first start as a Rockie, on April 6, he allowed one run in innings, struck out eight, and walked nobody in a 4‚Äì3 victory over San Diego. On June 10, he allowed one run and threw the only complete game of his career in a 6‚Äì1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. During the season, Hirsh would use his secondary pitches to such an extent that he failed to use his fastball, his best pitch, enough of the time. On July 2, he sprained his right ankle in a game against the Mets, diving back to the third base bag when catcher Paul LoDuca attempted to pick him off. He was forced to leave the game despite having pitched six shutout innings, and ended up on the disabled list from July 3 until August 1. His season was abruptly interrupted, however, when Hirsh went on the disabled list again after his right fibula was broken in a game August 7. Not realizing his leg had been broken on a line drive comebacker hit by the second batter of the game, J. J. Hardy, that caught him in the shin in the first inning, Hirsh went on to throw out Hardy and pitch six innings that day, earning a key win for the club. Asked what he would do the next time he faced Hardy, Hirsh joked: \\"I might put a catcher's shin guard on, just for him.\\" The injury ended his season. \\"I was crushed,\\" Hirsh said. \\"Obviously, nobody wants to have someone tell them that their season's cut short.\\" In 19 starts in 2007, Hirsh compiled a 5‚Äì7 record with a 4.81 earned run average, 75 strikeouts, and 48 walks in innings; he kept batters to a .204 batting average in their first plate appearance against him in games. Tracy Ringolsby wrote, \\"Hirsh would have moments, but they were limited. He was 4‚Äì7 with a 4.90 ERA in his first 17 starts, and more concerning to the Rockies was he worked five innings or fewer six times.\\" Hirsh missed pitching in the World Series, as he was still on the 60-Day DL. Hirsh was expected to be in the starting rotation in 2008, as the number 4 starter.Paige, Woody, \\"Repeat after me, Rockies,\\" The Denver Post, January 27, 2008, accessed August 4, 2009 But he found himself on the disabled list after just two scoreless innings in one spring training game, and started the season on the DL because of a strained muscle in his right rotator cuff and right rotator cuff inflammation. While on the DL, Hirsh spent a number of weeks in a strengthening program and at extended spring training in Tucson, Arizona, to rebuild his arm strength. \\"This is the first time I've ever really had injuries,\\" Hirsh said. \\"I had maybe one injury in the minor leagues coming up. Throughout my career, from when I was a little kid, I've never had arm problems, I've never broken a bone, I've never rolled an ankle. But I've managed to do all three of those in the last two years.\\" Hirsh was recalled in September and pitched in only four games during the season, including the first relief appearances of his career. His final major league appearance (a start) came on September 26; Hirsh gave up three runs in innings pitched and received a no-decision in a 6‚Äì4 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks. In four games (only one of which was a start), Hirsh had no record, an 8.31 ERA, six strikeouts, and four walks in innings. Pitching Hirsh had good leverage, pitched down to hitters, and had a refined repertoire of pitches. He had a \\"plus\\" 2-seam fastball that had sink and good movement at 91‚Äì94 mph, and threw a \\"filthy\\" hard-breaking slider that was consistently precise, and had bite at 80‚Äì86 mph (managers rated it the best breaking ball in the Texas League). Hirsh continued to refine his moderate changeup, which had fair deception and movement in the low-80s. He also threw a 4-seam fastball in the 94‚Äì96 mph range. He was not afraid to pitch inside, and threw strikes to both sides of the plate. \\"I'm 6-foot-8 and I keep a high three-quarters arm angle,\\" noted Hirsh. \\"You figure the mound is a foot and a half, and my arm may be another two, three, four feet. It makes the batter have to look up instead of straight at me, and he may have a difficult time adjusting.\\" During the 2007 season, Hirsh had trouble throwing his fastball enough. Pitching coach Bob Apodaca gave this assessment of Hirsh before 2008: \\"All Jason has to do is trust his stuff. He has the type of fastball you work off, but he was using his fastball the way you'd use an off-speed pitch ‚Äî- to try and trick hitters.\\" Injuries began plaguing Hirsh in 2007, and he had trouble recovering from them; he spent all of 2009 and 2010 in the minor leagues.

The meaning of the name is unknown. Valeria served as a commissioned ship for 8 months. Valeria (AKA-48) was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1909) on 8 April 1945 at Providence, R.I., by the Walsh-Kaiser Co., Inc.; launched on 29 May 1945; sponsored by Mrs. A. D. Hunter; and transferred to the Navy on 28 June 1945 and commissioned the same day, Lt. Comdr. Robert Smith Trower III in command. Service history The new attack cargo ship departed Boston on 9 July; conducted shakedown training in the Chesapeake Bay; and got underway on 29 July, bound for the Canal Zone. She transited the Panama Canal on 5 August and steamed westward, conducting gunnery exercises en route. During her passage to Oahu, hostilities ended in the Pacific. On the 18th, Valeria moored at Pearl Harbor. On 7 September, she got underway for Noumea. Ten days later, the ship reached Espiritu Santo where she took on troops from and . On the 19th, Valeria proceeded to Noum√©a where she disembarked her passengers. Underway again the next day, she returned to Espiritu Santo on the 22d. There, on the 25th, the attack cargo ship loaded elements of the 85th Construction Battalion and departed the New Hebrides the following day. She steamed via Eniwetok and delivered her cargo and passengers at Wake Island early in October. She completed discharging her cargo there on the 12th and reported for \\"Magic Carpet\\" duties ‚Äî transporting returning servicemen from the Pacific islands to the United States mainland. Before the end of the year, she made two round trips carrying returning Army veterans from Eniwetok and Saipan to West Coast ports. Assigned to the 5th Naval District on 5 January 1946, Valeria departed Los Angeles, California, on the 11th, steamed via the Panama Canal to the Atlantic coast, and arrived at Norfolk on 1 February. She was decommissioned on 18 March, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 17 April. Valeria was delivered to the War Shipping Administration at Lee Hall, Va., on 26 June 1946.

While states like Ohio, Nevada, Florida and New Mexico have been arguably stronger indicators of political trends in recent years, Missouri was a consistent swing state throughout the 20th century. Prior to the 2008 elections, Lincoln County, Missouri was said to be the only bellwether county in a bellwether state.Missouri Bellwether County Undecided This Election, an October 17, 2008 article from the NPR website Missouri was also considered a bellwether of U.S. views on hot-button social issues such as stem cell researchStltoday.com Churches joining stem cell showdown and school vouchers. Some economists also consider the state a bellwether for economic trends such as consumer confidence and unemployment.Business Perspectives The Missouri economy: an overview Political history From 1904 to 2004, Missouri's electoral votes went to the person who became President of the United States, with one exception: in 1956 during the landslide re-election of President Dwight Eisenhower, when Missouri went to Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson. Missouri's accuracy in voting with the national consensus includes the \\"too close to call\\" elections of 1948 (when Missourian Harry S. Truman was elected to his only full term as President), 1960, 1976, 2000, and 2016. In 2006, Missouri's bellwether status gained renewed attention because of the 2006 Senate race between incumbent Republican Senator Jim Talent and Democratic State Auditor Claire McCaskill, which was considered vital to which party controls Congress.Washington Post President Comes to Aid of Vulnerable Senator in Missouri, Seen as Bellwether StateUS News and World Report Missouri Two- step Additionally, Missouri had a ballot measure, Missouri Amendment Two, regarding stem cell research that drew national attention as an indicator of mainstream sentiment towards this controversial issue.Pam Solo and Gail Pressberg Stem Cell Research Is Winning Mainstream Issue in 2006 Voting On Election Day 2006, both McCaskill and Amendment 2 narrowly received majority support among Missouri voters. The victories of McCaskill and five other Democratic colleagues allowed their party to regain power in the U.S. Senate.Michael Gawenda America votes for change Missouri was again the center of much media attention in 2012, after Rep. Todd Akin (R, MO-2) made controversial remarks regarding what he called \\"legitimate rape.\\" Prior to these remarks, McCaskill was seen as one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents. McCaskill went on to win the 2012 election by nearly sixteen points. During the 2008 Presidential primaries, the state voted for the presidential candidates who eventually secured their parties' nomination: John McCain (Republican) and Barack Obama (Democratic). Missouri did the same in 2016, voting for Hillary Clinton by a razor thin margin in the Democratic primary‚Äîactually tying with her opponent Bernie Sanders in one county‚Äîand voting narrowly for Donald Trump in the Republican primary. Despite her running mate having grown-up in the state and having significant ties to the state, Clinton lost the state to Trump in the general election. Possible causes Location and demographics are most often cited as the cause of Missouri's bellwether status. In 2004, the Chicago Tribune called Missouri the \\"bellwether state that almost exactly mirrors the demographic, economic and political makeup of the nation.\\" A microcosm of the country's current political makeup, Missouri has its two Blue \\"coasts\\" of St. Louis and Kansas City with Red middle and southern areas (see Red states and blue states). Future of bellwether status Missouri's continuing status as a bellwether has been questioned. In 2008, Missouri narrowly voted for the losing candidate, Republican John McCain, despite an electoral college landslide for Democrat Barack Obama. In the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election, Missouri favored losing candidate Mitt Romney by nearly 10 percentage points, despite another big victory for Barack Obama across the rest of the country. In the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, Missouri again voted Republican, this time for Donald Trump. As a result, Missouri's accuracy rate for the last 29 presidential elections is now 89.66%. Ohio has about the same record of voting for the winning candidate in missing three times; it has voted for the winner of every presidential election since 1896 except for 1944 and 1960, with no Republican ever winning the White House without Ohio. Nevada has been carried by the winner in every presidential election since 1912, except just twice in 1976 and 2016. Also, New Mexico has voted for the winner of every presidential election from its statehood in 1912 except in the 1976, 2000 and 2016 elections. One of the more important national phenomena that has not had the same impact in Missouri as in the rest of the country is the influx of immigrants, particularly Latinos. Analysts and journalists in recent times have pointed to states like Ohio,Fox News Ohio Special Election Could Be '06 Bellwether New Mexico,CNN Showdown States: New Mexico and Pennsylvania,Franklin & Marshall The Pennsylvania Paradox as more accurate political and cultural bellwethers. Also, the 21st century Missouri electorate is much less urbanized than that of the 20th century. In 1900, the combined population of St. Louis (575,238) and Kansas City (163,752) was 24% of the population of Missouri (3,106,665), while by 1950 the combined population of St. Louis (856,796) and Kansas City (456,622) had actually grown to 33% of the population of Missouri (3,954,653). But shortly thereafter the population of St. Louis began a sharp decline, while that of Kansas City remained nearly static, so that the state is now much more dominated by rural, suburban, and small-city voters, who are generally more conservative: by 2000 the combined populations of St. Louis (348,189) and Kansas City (441,545) had declined to 14% of the population of Missouri (5,595,211). This shift, however, is a direct product of the small geographic size of St. Louis City, which is nearly unique among major urban centers in having locked its boundaries in 1876. When the population of St. Louis County is included in these figures, Missouri's ratio of major metropolitan residents to rural residents closely matches the nation as a whole. Slate columnist Chris Suellentrop has said that the state now \\"isn't so much a bellwether as it is a weathervane: It doesn't swing the country, the country swings it...\\" and that Missouri is a better indicator of whether a trend is mainstream than of what the next new trend will be.Swingers: A guide to the swing state Missouri See also * United States presidential election in Missouri, 2012 * United States presidential election in Missouri, 2008 * United States presidential election in Missouri, 1956 * United States presidential elections in Missouri * As Maine goes, so goes the nation * Missouri demographics References * David Brian Robertson (2004) \\"Bellwether Politics in Missouri,\\" The Forum: Vol. 2: No. 3, Article 2.

He is sometimes known as the \\"father of the American Christmas card\\".  Youth  Louis Prang House, Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts Louis Prang Factory, Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts Prang was born in Breslau in Prussian Silesia. His father Jonas Louis Prang was a textile manufacturer and of French Huguenot origin; his mother, Rosina Silverman, was German. Because of health problems as a boy, Prang was unable to receive much standard schooling and became an apprentice to his father, learning engraving and calico dyeing and printing. In the early 1840s, Prang travelled around Bohemia working in printing and textiles. However, after some travel in Europe, he became involved in revolutionary activities in 1848. Pursued by the Prussian government, he went to Switzerland and in 1850 emigrated to the United States and Boston, Massachusetts.  Early work  Prang's early activities in the US publishing architectural books and making leather goods were not very successful, and he began to make wood engravings for illustrations in books. In 1851 he worked for Frank Leslie, art director for Gleason's Pictorial Drawing-Room Companion, and later with John Andrew of John Andrew & Son. In 1851, he married Rosa Gerber, a Swiss woman he had met in Paris in 1846. Lincoln as a boy, reading at night, by Eastman Johnson Lydia Very's verse version of Red Riding Hood (1863), one of a series of shaped die- cut books issued by Prang.  Lithography and career  In 1856, Prang and a partner created a firm, Prang and Mayer, to produce lithographs. The company specialized in prints of buildings and towns in Massachusetts. In 1860, he bought the share of his partner, creating L. Prang & Company and began work in color printing of advertising and other forms of business materials.Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. p. 148. . The firm became quite successful, and became known for war maps, printed during the American Civil War and distributed by newspapers. In 1864, Prang went to Europe to learn about cutting-edge German lithography. Returning the next year, Prang began to create high quality reproductions of major art works. Prang also began creating series of popular album cards, advertised to be collected into scrapbooks, showing natural scenes and patriotic symbols. At Christmas 1873, Prang began creating greeting cards for the popular market in England and began selling the Christmas card in America in 1874. Therefore, he is sometimes called the \\"father of the American Christmas card\\". Prang is also known for his efforts to improve art education in the US, publishing instructional books and creating a foundation to train art teachers. Prang was an active supporter of women artists, both commissioning and collecting artworks by women. Many of his lithographs featured works by female artists, such as the botanical illustration of Ellen Thayer Fisher. In 1881, his company employed more than one hundred women. In June 1886 Prang published a series of prints under the title Prang's War Pictures: Aquarelle Facsimile Prints. These became popular and helped inspire a genre of such prints, particularly the series issued by Kurz and Allison. However, Prang aimed at a more modern and individual treatment, as opposed to the panoramic style of Kurz and Allison, and before them, Currier and Ives. In 1897 L. Prang & Company merged with the Taber Art Company of New Bedford, Massachusetts, creating the Taber-Prang Company and moved to Springfield, Massachusetts. Prang died of pleuropneumonia on June 15, 1909, at the Glendale Sanitarium in Los Angeles. He is buried in Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts.

The school is part of Fauquier County Public School System and is located at 6300 Independence Avenue. History Liberty opened in 1994 to alleviate crowding at Fauquier High School, the sole high school in Fauquier County at the time. The school was also built to accommodate the sprawling southern part of the county, close to the Fredericksburg area; this is one of the fastest growing areas in Virginia. Liberty High School opened under the leadership of Mr. John C. Harrison, Liberty's first principal and longtime educator in the Fauquier County School System. Liberty's original administrative team included John C. Harrison, Roger Lee, Linda Neiderer and John Fitzgerald. Mr. Fitzgerald was the first to leave his post (date unknown), followed by Roger Lee, who took a position as assistant principal at neighboring Fauquier High School. Mr. Harrison retired at the completion of the 1999-2000 school year. Mr. Harrison's successor, Dr. Trudy K. Peterman, took the helm as Liberty's second principal but her tenure proved short-lived after a battle with the school system's superintendent, and school board over the handling of the schools' HVAC system and resulting mold issues. Dr. Peterman was placed on administrative leave in late January, 2001 and did not return to the helm of the school. A familiar face, former principal John C. Harrison, returned to head Liberty temporarily to provide a calming effect for the community, the faculty and staff and, most importantly, the students for the completion of the 2000-2001 school year. Mr. Harrison remained principal for the following school year as time was taken to find a proper replacement. At the beginning of the 2002-2003 school year, former assistant principal Roger Lee, a member of the school's original administrative team, returned to become Liberty's third principal. Mr. Lee continues to serve as Liberty's principal for the 2008-2009 school year, working with Linda Neiderer, the assistant principal who has been at Liberty from the start. In 2008, Kettle Run High School opened in Fauquier County under the leadership of Major Warner II, who had been a former guidance director at Liberty during the 2000 school year. This reduced Liberty's enrollment from 1771 to around 1400. Demographics In 2017-18, Liberty's student body was 67.8% White; 10.8% Black; 16.8% Hispanic; 1% Asian; and 3% consisted of Two or More Races.https://www.schooldigger.com/go/VA/schools/0132000854/school.aspx Accreditation Liberty High School is a fully accredited high school based on its performance on the Standards of Learning tests in Virginia.

It was built to a design by the English architect George Thomas Hine who was a prolific Victorian architect of hospital buildings. It was opened in 1893 making it the Fifth Middlesex County Asylum. Historic England identified the hospital as being \\"the most important asylum built in England after 1875\\". Since the closure of the hospital, the site was redeveloped as housing and a gymnasium under the name Repton Park. The hospital block, tower, and chapel, which is now a swimming complex, were designated as a Grade II listed building in 1990. History alt= A social room at Claybury Asylum. Photograph by the London & County Photographic Company from 1893. alt= The project The building of Claybury Hospital was commissioned by the Middlesex Court of Magistrates in 1887 and would eventually become the fifth Middlesex County Asylum. It was built to a design by the English architect George Thomas Hine who was a prolific, late-Victorian architect of mainly hospital buildings and asylums for the mentally insane. It was the first asylum to successfully use the echelon plan upon which all later asylums were based. The site was situated on the brow of a hill and was surrounded by of ancient woodland and of open parkland, ponds, pasture and historic gardens. These had been designed in 1789 by the landscape architect Humphry Repton.  Early years  In 1889 the uncompleted building passed to the newly created London County Council which opened it in 1893 as the Claybury Lunatic Asylum. By 1896, the hospital had 2,500 patients. The first Medical Superintendent and directing genius was Robert Armstrong-Jones. By the first decade of the twentieth century, Claybury had become a major centre of psychiatric learning. It was internationally admired for its research, its pioneering work in introducing new forms of treatment and the high standard of care provided for the mentally ill. Armstrong-Jones was knighted in 1917 for his exceptional work at Claybury and his general service to psychiatry. Armstrong-Jones held progressive views on community care, advocating in 1906 that city hospitals should have out-patient departments where patients could seek help for mental symptoms without loss of liberty. Each asylum should be a centre for clinical instruction where all medical practitioners could refresh their understanding of insanity. People showing early signs of insanity should be free to seek advice and if necessary be admitted on a voluntary basis and not have to wait until they became certifiable.Jones, Robert (1906) quoted in Pryor (1993) p. 71. The first voluntary patients could not admitted until 1930 when the Mental Treatment Act was passed.Pryor (1993) p. 87. In 1895, the London County Council appointed Frederick Mott as director for their new research laboratory at Claybury. Over the next 19 years he carried out vast research, documented in his Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry published between 1903 and 1922. He was knighted in 1919 and is particularly remembered for helping to establish that 'general paralysis of the insane (GPI) was due to syphilis.Pryor (1993) pp. 67-70. Helen Boyle was appointed as an Assistant Medical Officer in 1895, one of the first women to be employed as a doctor in an asylum. She became a pioneer of early treatment for the mentally ill and went on to found the Lady Chichester Hospital. In 1939 she became the first female president of the Royal Medico- Psychological Association (now the Royal College of Psychiatrists). In Pryor's words: \\"The work of this 'lady doctor' formed part of the pale new dawn of community care for the mentally ill.\\"Pryor (1993) pp. 70-72 The asylum was renamed Claybury Mental Hospital in 1930 and simplified to Claybury Hospital in 1959.  A patient experience in the 1930s  The English artist, Thomas Hennell, published an account of his personal experience of schizophrenia in his book, The Witnesses, in 1938. Sectioned and detained at St John's Hospital, Stone, Buckinghamshire in 1935, he was then moved to the Maudsley Hospital in London, and finally, to Claybury. He disliked his treatment at the first two, and satirised the Maudsley psychiatrists, but he enjoyed the humane therapy at Claybury (though there is a signed drawing by him in the Tate of staff stealing from a patient in Claybury). In the course of his illness he produced several pictures that depicted his mental state. Before leaving Claybury in 1938, the medical superintendent, Guy Barham, agreed to him painting a large mural covering three walls of the canteen. A photograph of this painting was rediscovered circa 2015. He became an official war artist during World War II.  Post-war years  Claybury became part of the National Health Service in 1948. The introduction of new drugs, the phenothiazines in 1955 and 1956, and the anti-depressant drugs in 1959, dramatically altered the treatment of the major psychoses, reducing the severity and duration of many conditions and creating a setting where normalisation could flourish.Pryor (1993) pp. 127,128 From the mid-1950s Claybury again attracted widespread attention as, led by consultants Denis Martin and John Pippard, it pioneered a controversial therapeutic community approach to an entire institution of over 2,700 people.Pryor (1993) pp. 135-140 In 1968, Martin described the development of Claybury's therapeutic community in Adventure in Psychiatry. In 1972 a collection of essays by staff members and edited by Elizabeth Shoenberg were published under the title, A Hospital Looks at Itself: The three pronged attack of therapeutic community techniques, use of new drugs and minimal use of the physical treatments, led to a reduction of the patient population from 2,332 in 1950 to 1,537 in 1970. However, lack of community care resulted in the 'revolving door syndrome' with over half admissions being re-admissions.Pryor (1993) pp. 137-138. From the late 1940s it became increasingly difficult to recruit student nurses and other support staff from the UK. Many, with little English, were recruited from Europe and given English language tuition.Pryor (1993) p.124. In 1962, Enoch Powell, then Minister of Health, proposed that hospitals should seek recruits from the West Indies and Pakistan.Shepherd (1997), pp. 222‚Äì226 By 1968 there were 47 nationalities represented at Claybury with different ethnic, religious and linguistic backgrounds, all part of the therapeutic community diversity.  Developments in community care  Enoch Powell had predicted in 1961 that all psychiatric hospitals would be closed within 15 years. In reality, the first, Banstead, closed in 1986. In 1983 the North East Thames Regional Health Authority (NETRHA) committed itself to a 10-year plan for the re-provision of care currently provided by Friern and Claybury hospitals.Pryor (1993) pp. 162-166. The number of patients on Claybury's statuary books at the year end in 1980 was 1,057 and in 1990 was 429.Pryor (1993) p. 211-213 For some long-stay patients, thoroughly institutionalised, Claybury had been both home and local village for decades, in some cases for over 40 years. The challenge to manage their rehabilitation in a new environment, that they had never experienced and might well treat them with suspicion, was immense. In 1988 the Health and Social Services Research Unit at South Bank Polytechnic published a research paper detailing the post- discharge experience of a group of former long-stay Claybury patients. Closure Claybury Asylum, ground floor plan To mark its centenary in 1993, the Forest Healthcare Trust published a comprehensive and well documented history of the hospital entitled, Claybury, A Century of Caring, written by Eric Pryor who had been a member of the nursing staff since 1948. With the Care in the Community Programme and the planned decline in patient numbers, the Claybury site faced a difficult future. The NHS pressed for extensive demolition and maximum new build, whereas the Local Planning Authority and English Heritage argued for maximum retention of the historic buildings and restriction of new build to the existing footprint, in accordance with the Green Belt allocation in the Unitary Development Plan. A 60-day Public Inquiry was held in 1997 and the Council/English Heritage position was accepted. The hospital was shut down and converted into luxury flats called Repton Park by Crest Nicholson, working closely with English Heritage and the London Wildlife Trust. Historic England identified the hospital as being \\"the most important asylum built in England after 1875... [it was] the first asylum to successfully use the echelon plan, upon which all later asylums were based.\\" The hospital block, including the chapel, which is now a swimming complex, were designated as a Grade II listed building in 1990, as was the stable block, which is located to the north west of the main building.

R√©sistance internationaliste first surfaced in December 2004. Based on communiqu√©s believed to originate from the group, the R√©sistance internationaliste appears to hold anti-capitalist, environmentalist and anti-American views. The group has claimed responsibility for three attacks, all in Canada.  Hydro tower bombing  In 2004, shortly before U.S. President George W. Bush's visit to Canada, a Hydro-Qu√©bec electric tower along the Quebec ‚Äì New England Transmission circuit in the Eastern Townships of Quebec near the Canada‚ÄìUS border was damaged by explosive charges detonated at its base. The CBC reported that a message, purportedly from the R√©sistance internationaliste and issued to La Presse, Le Journal de Montr√©al and CKAC radio, stated that the attack had been carried out to \\"denounce the 'pillaging' of Quebec's resources by the United States.\\"Earth Liberation: \\"Bomb Attack On a Hydro-Quebec Tower\\", December 6, 2004 (from Google cache).  Car firebombing  On Friday, August 4, 2006, a car belonging to Carol Montreuil, a spokesman for the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute, exploded in the town of Sainte-Th√©r√®se, near Montreal. After having initially concluded that the explosion was the result of an electrical malfunction, the S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec provincial police force ordered an investigation by its anti-terrorism branch when a number of media outlets received an email from a source claiming to be the R√©sistance internationaliste. The email stated that the group had carried out the attack in protest against the actions of oil companies, in particular the alleged funding of \\"an imperialist army which is committing barbarous acts\\", an apparent reference to the war in Iraq. The CBC reported that the same email also contained accusations against the oil companies of consumer abuse and environmental degradation. On August 18 of the same year, the S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec confirmed that the car was indeed firebombed, as claimed by the email.

On January 22, 2007, it declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. The company's motto was Certified Fun History The Symphony SA-160 An aerial view of the Symphony Aircraft Industries plant in Trois- Rivi√®res, August 2005 Symphony Aircraft Industries President and CEO Paul Costanzo, August 2005 OMF Aircraft SAI was started in September 2003 as the North American production arm of Ostmecklenburgische Flugzeugbau GmbH, (East Mecklenburg Aircraft Works Limited). The company was commonly known as OMF Aircraft. OMF was formed by Mathias Stinnes in 1998 and was headquartered in Neubrandenburg Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Stinnes formed OMF Aircraft to produce a FAR 23 certified version of the Stoddard-Hamilton Glastar. He had built and flown one of these amateur-built aircraft in the 1990s and believed that it would make a good production aircraft. The certified version of the Glastar was to be called the OMF-100-160 Symphony with certification targeted for 2000. Realizing that the bulk of the market for this aircraft was in North America Stinnes set up a production facility in Trois-Rivi√®res with financial help from the Government of Quebec. The plant building was constructed by the Town of Trois-Rivi√®res and leased to OMF. The plant was opened in September 2003. OMF suffered from under-financing during its start-up phase and declared bankruptcy in December 2003. Due to agreements in place, the production rights for the OMF-100-160 Symphony resided in Canada while the intellectual property rights were retained in Germany. Symphony Aircraft Industries The Canadian plant operation was reorganized as a private company under the name of Symphony Aircraft Industries, while the intellectual property rights to the OMF-100-160 Symphony were sold by the bankruptcy trustees to a new German company, OMF Flugzeugwerk. An agreement was signed between OMF Flugzeugwerk and Symphony Aircraft to produce the design on two production lines in North America and Europe. This soon proved unworkable and OMF Flugzeugwerk sold out their interests to SAI in February 2005. SAI redesignated the aircraft as the Symphony SA-160 and completed Transport Canada certification under CAR 523, with Transport Canada manufacturing approval achieved in March 2005. On May 4, 2005 SAI completed FAA Type Certification, based on the Canadian certification and the first SAI produced aircraft received its FAA Certificate of Airworthiness on May 13, 2005. The company started by producing two Symphony 160s per month in early 2005 with production increasing to three per month in the fall of 2005 and five per month in 2006. The company pursued certification of a Ballistic Recovery Systems full aircraft parachute system and also an Avidyne glass cockpit instrumentation installation. SAI filed for protection from creditors under the Canadian Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act in June 2006. At that time the company stated that it needed an investment of US$5.5M to continue production. The company was not able to secure the capital in Canada and indicated at that time that it might have to relocate production to attract financing from other sources. CEO Paul Costanzo indicated that factors involved in this situation included the dramatic fall in value of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar between 2003‚Äì2006, start-up and product improvement costs that were greater than expected and especially a venture capital environment in the Province of Quebec that Costanzo described as \\"dismal\\". He stated at the time, \\"We have simply been unable to attract sufficient capital to allow us to effectively exploit the obvious opportunity that we have with the SA-160, let alone fund our planned development of a diesel two-place and a four-place product.\\" He indicated then that the company was focusing on certification of the SA-160's glass cockpit installation along with product cost reduction measures. On January 22, 2007, following the withdrawal of its lead investor three days previously, Symphony Aircraft declared bankruptcy, closed its doors and laid off its entire workforce. NAFTAA On February 3, 2008 it was publicly announced that the former lead investor in Symphony Aircraft, Lou Simons, was planning to restart production of the SA-160 under the name North American Factory for Technologically Advanced Aircraft (NAFTAA). The intention at that time was that aircraft may be produced at a different location and may have a new name. Also planned were additional versions of the SA-160. The new company announced in July 2008 that they intended to restart production by the end of 2009 at the previous plant in Trois Riveries, with a plan to produce 15 aircraft in 2009 and ramp up production to 50 to 80 per year by 2012. The aircraft were to have been given a new name and be available in a VFR version intended for flight school use, a basic IFR version and a glass cockpit equipped version powered by a 200-hp Lycoming IO-390 powerplant giving it a forecast cruise speed of 148 knots. The plan was never completed and no new aircraft were produced.

Founded in 1862 and constructed in the Kirkbride Plan design in 1883, it is the oldest operating psychiatric hospital in the state of Oregon, and one of the oldest continuously operated hospitals on the West Coast. The hospital was established after the close of the Oregon Hospital for the Insane in Portland, located north of Salem. Originally named the Oregon Hospital for the Insane, the Oregon State Hospital was active in the fields of electroconvulsive therapy, lobotomies, eugenics, and hydrotherapy. In the mid-twentieth century, the facility experienced significant overcrowding problems, with a peak of nearly 3,600 patients. In 1961, Dammasch State Hospital opened in Clackamas County near Portland, which served to mitigate the hospital's overcrowding issues. Dammasch would close in 1995. In the early twenty-first century, the hospital received public criticism for its aging facilities and treatment of patients, and the hospital's management of 5,000 canisters of unclaimed human cremains was the subject of a 2005 Pulitzer Prize-winning series published in The Oregonian. The discovery of these remains is the subject of the 2011 documentary \\"Library of Dust\\".https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1764454 In 2007, the state of Oregon approved a $458 million plan to rebuild the main hospital to a downsized 620-bed facility, which was completed in 2013. Portions of the original hospital buildings were demolished, though the center of the Kirkbride building was salvaged and renovated, and now houses a mental health museum. Oregon State Hospital is located in the eponymous Oregon State Hospital Historic District, and was registered with the National Register for Historic Places in 2008. It was the primary filming location for the 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, as well as being the subject of a series of photographs by photographer Mary Ellen Mark in 1976.  History=1862‚Äì1900: Establishment and early years  Oregon State Hospital, 1881 The original Oregon Hospital for the Insane was established by American physician James C. Hawthorne in what was then East Portland, Oregon, (now the Hawthorne District). The facility was built in 1862, and the street on which it was built was renamed Asylum Avenue. Local residents protested about the name, however, and it was renamed Hawthorne in honor of the hospital's founder in 1888. The street in Salem on which the current hospital is located, Center Street, was also originally named Asylum Avenue. Activist Dorothea Dix was an advocate of Hawthorne's original hospital, which she had visited twice, but was a vocal critic of the opening of the new state hospital, believing the state was ill-prepared to care for patients adequately. The Oregon constitution mandated that state hospitals be built in the capital city of Salem. Groundbreaking began May 1, 1881, and the hospital was completed in 1883. The newly built, state-funded hospital opened as the Oregon State Insane Asylum on October 23, 1883, and was constructed based on the Kirkbride Plan for a total of $184,000 (). Its architecture is Italianate in style, and was designed by W.F. Boothby. Dr. Simeon Josephi was appointed superintendent of the hospital from its opening until May 1887, and strived to base his treatment methods on those used by Dr. Hawthorne. He was succeeded by Dr. Harry Lane, who implemented an \\"aggressive\\" vaccination program to combat smallpox outbreaks. By 1891, the hospital housed a total of 478 male and 212 female patients; the growing influx of patients led to two additional wings being added onto the hospital, followed by a conversion from gas to electric lighting. Additionally, the hospital infirmary was completed in 1892. In 1896, the most commonly reported causes for insanity at the hospital were epilepsy, intemperance, masturbation, and religious paranoia. In 1900, the hospital began to expand its campus, with two additional women's wards and four men's being added to the main building. According to historical documents, the hospital had admitted a total of 5,046 patients since its opening, 1,243 of which had been \\"released as recovered,\\" 1,051 \\"improved,\\" while at least 1,058 had died in the hospital. Oregon State Hospital 1900 =Tunnels and narrow- gauge railroad= A narrow gauge railroad was established on the grounds of the hospital during its construction, leading into different tunnels and buildings. These tunnels allowed the hospital to move patients between buildings without the public observing and are marked by purple-colored glass prisms embedded in the roads to provide lighting.Esteve, Harry. Capitol scene 2001 Oregon Legislature. The Oregonian, January 8, 2001. The tunnels connect different buildings of the State Hospital together. The narrow gauge railroad did extend to the penitentiary but not within a tunnel; remnants of this line still existed as of February 2009. The State Capitol and associated buildings also have a tunnel system to this day (parts of which are publicly accessible) but they have never been connected to the State Hospital. While the narrow gauge railroad is no longer used, the tunnels were once used daily to deliver food, laundry, and other items‚Äîand occasionally patients‚Äîbetween different buildings. The rails are no longer evident in many places and the flangeways are filled in, leaving only the head of the rail exposed. At one point transport within the tunnels was by means of electric carts and occasionally bicycles. When the railroad was used, cars made of bamboo were pushed to their destinations. Few spurs or sidings were found on the railroad, so cars were simply stopped on the track where it was necessary to load or unload them, and then pushed away. A number of the bamboo railroad cars were converted to non- rail cars by removing the railroad wheels and adding casters; one of these cars is displayed in the Oregon State Hospital Mental Health Museum. In addition to the narrow gauge railroad, a standard gauge railroad spur from the Southern Pacific's Geer Branch extended north from the penitentiary to the State Hospital. A portion of the grade of this spur remains along with two short portions of the standard gauge rails embedded in asphalt within and outside of Buildings 61 and 73 on the hospital grounds. 1901‚Äì2000: Expansion and overcrowding Hospital's men's baseball team, 1901 In 1900, a survey of the hospital's patients revealed a total of 1,188 patients, ranging from the ages of eight to eighty-six-years-old. The most common causes of insanity reported by the hospital at the time were \\"excessive living,\\" liquor, narcotics, and venereal disease. In 1910, the red brick Kirkbride building was painted white, and in 1913, the hospital was officially renamed Oregon State Hospital. The board and trustees had petitioned for a name change prior; in an 1897 biennial report, it was noted: > [We would] also recommend to your honorable body that the present name of > the institution, the \\"Oregon State Insane Asylum,\\" be changed to \\"Oregon > State Hospital.\\" The disgrace felt by patients, as well as the humiliation > of their relatives and friends, would be largely obviated by a correct > understanding of the character and objects of the institution, and this > would be conserved by the change suggested. The same year, in 1913, the Eastern Oregon State Asylum was also established in Pendleton. In 1912, the Dome Building, the receiving ward of the hospital, was officially opened, designed by architect Edgar M. Lazarus; at the time, the hospital's number of patients had continued to grow, with around 500 patients entering the hospital each year. The Dome Building incorporated hydrotherapeutic facilities for patients. By 1924, the total number of patients living on the hospital campus had grown to 1,864, with a staff of over 200 employees and 5 physicians. Beginning in 1923, the hospital participated in the eugenics movement, sterilizing a total of more than 2,600 patients until the early 1980s. Common procedures and experimental practices that took place at the hospital included electroconvulsive therapy, insulin shock therapy, and Metrazol shock therapy, the latter two of which were introduced in 1937. On November 18, 1942, a mass poisoning occurred at the hospital after a dinner serving of scrambled eggs. Within minutes patients complained of stomach and leg cramps, began vomiting, and had respiratory difficulties. Overall, 467 people got sick and 47 people died. Forensic examination determined that the poisoning was due to a mix-up in the kitchen. Instead of powdered milk, sodium fluoride, a poison to kill cockroaches, had been used in the cooking process. In 1955, the hospital constructed a 676-bed building for geriatric patients to deal with increasing numbers of aging and elderly patients. The hospital's population began to steadily increase in the middle of the century; this led to the opening of Dammasch State Hospital in Clackamas County, near Portland, which was established to help mitigate overcrowding problems. At the time, the Oregon State Hospital had reached a peak number of 3,545 patients. Columbia Park Hospital had also opened in The Dalles in 1959. In March 1966, the hospital added the Salem Rehabilitation Center to its campus with the intention of training long-stay patients into work relationships. The reduction in patient numbers further allowed the hospital to introduce other programs, including a training program for psychiatric nurses, as well as a two-year residency program for physicians to study psychiatry. A volunteer program for local teenagers to work on the hospital grounds was also introduced in 1965. In 1975, Dr. Brooks, the hospital superintendent, allowed the production of the Milo≈° Forman film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to shoot inside the hospital and on its campus. At the time, the hospital's patient residency had been lowered significantly by the openings of Dammasch and the Eastern Oregon State Hospital, which allowed accommodation for the film's production. The following year, in 1976, the hospital established the Child and Adolescent Secure Treatment Program for children, treating patients from age eight to eighteen. In 1981 and 1983, respectively, the hospital abolished the practice of lobotomy and dismantled its eugenics program. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the hospital again continued to experience issues with overcrowding; in 1991, it was noted that the hospital was so overcrowded that beds were placed in corridors and smoking rooms in wards. 2000‚Äì2008: Public criticism Memorial where cremains from unclaimed patients are kept, 2015 By the turn of the twenty-first century, the hospital began to experience criticism from the public over its aging facilities and patient care. In 2004, the Salem Statesman Journal conducted a two-month investigation into the facility, in which they claimed the hospital's living conditions were overcrowded, also noting outdated facilities. Additionally, the newspaper reported systematic problems resulting in drug addicts and alcoholics being wrongly admitted, as well as severe understaffing and failure of the hospital to properly investigate and prosecute patient assaults against staff members. A 2004 investigation by the Statesman Journal led to further investigation into the hospital, and a 2005 architectural assessment of the facility determined that the site was unsafe. The same year, the hospital's Child and Adolescent Secure Treatment Program was dismantled, and the Oregon Advocacy Center filed a federal suit alleging that overcrowding and understaffing posed a risk to both patients and staff. On August 8, 2006, the hospital was fined US$10,200 for asbestos violations. Another controversy at the hospital involved the fate of over 5,000 copper canisters of human cremated remains that had been kept in the basement of the original building over a period of decades. The canisters were brought to public attention after senator Peter Courtney came across them while touring the hospital in 2004; the canisters had been relocated to Building 60 on the hospital campus, many of which were corroded and oxidized from moisture exposure. The remains were the subject of a Pulitzer Prize-winning series by The Oregonian newspaper, published in 2005.Kershaw, Sarah, \\"Long-Forgotten Reminders of Oregon's Mentally Ill\\", The New York Times, March 14, 2005 In 2007, the hospital was granted permission from the state to release the names of the deceased in hopes of returning the unclaimed remains to proper family members. In 2011, Building 60 was renovated and converted into a public memorial housing the unclaimed remains. As of July 2014, state officials had discovered that 1,500 sets of remains may have been lost. =Department of Justice report= In 2008, the United States Department of Justice filed a report which criticized the quality of care provided to patients by the hospital. A subsequent report criticizing the hospital was largely focused on the death of Moises Perez, a patient with paranoid schizophrenia who had been admitted to the hospital in 1995 after being found \\"guilty except for insanity\\" of attempted murder. Perez, who was listed as and weighing over , went missing on October 17, 2009, and was later found deceased in the hospital; an autopsy confirmed his cause of death as coronary artery disease. The U.S. Department of Justice criticized the hospital's care of Perez and his health, to which the hospital responded with a list of twenty-five significant improvements that had been implemented, including \\"enhanced patient monitoring, increased medical and nursing staff levels, and new standards for dispensing medication.\\" 2009‚Äìpresent: Reconstruction  Hospital campus during construction in 2011 Amidst the public and federal criticisms against the hospital, the board and trustees put forth a $458 million plan approved by the Oregon Legislative Assembly in 2007, which called for the construction of a replacement hospital in Salem with as many as 620 beds, as well as a 360-bed facility in Junction City. Portions of the dilapidated, 125-year-old main Kirkbride building were torn down and replaced beginning in September 2008. The same year, the entire hospital campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Construction of the new Salem facility began in 2009, and was completed around 2011; with the Junction City facility being completed in 2013. Salem mayor Janet Taylor has called for the number of beds to be reduced to 320 or fewer, and another hospital facility to be built in or near Portland. During a 2008 excavation, artifacts from a frontier homestead were uncovered on the grounds of the Oregon State Hospital campus. Recovered items included earthen dishes, glass windows, a canning jar and a lamp chimney. Further excavation will be required to determine if the artifacts are connected to the 1852 homestead of Morgan L. \\"Lute\\" Savage. Construction on the new hospital was completed in 2012, with capacity increased to 620 beds. The hospital also created room for the Museum of Mental Health. The museum is located in the Kirkbride Building but it is operated by a non-profit organization that is separate from the hospital administration. It includes history about many of the discontinued practices that are no longer considered proper treatment for mental illnesses as well as updates on current practices. Population=Patients A 2005 census of the state hospitals in Oregon (in Salem, Portland, and Pendleton) listed close to 750 patients. In March 2005, the state closed the adolescent treatment ward of the Oregon State Hospital, which now provides services only to people over the age of 18. About two-thirds of the hospital's patients in 2008 had been found guilty of crimes, and also to be insane. Others were a danger to themselves or to others.

Orr had been Superintendent since February 25, 2008. Harris, head of Oregon Health Authority's Addictions and Mental Health Division, held responsibility for state hospitals in Salem, Portland and Pendleton, in addition to the staff who work with county governments to deliver statewide mental-health and addiction services.Oregon DHS: Reporter tools ‚Äì Leader biographies and photos On February 1, 2018, the Oregon Health Authority announced the appointment of Dolores Matteucci as the hospital's new superintendent.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 455. Corriganville is part of the Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. Geography Corriganville lies north of Cumberland at the confluence of Wills Creek and Jennings Run. Maryland Route 36 passes through Corriganville, and Maryland Route 35 heads north from there to Ellerslie. Cumberland Bone Cave A fossilized skeleton of a Smilodon californicus on display at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History In 1912, workers excavating a cut for the Western Maryland Railway broke into a partly filled cave along the western slope of Wills Mountain, near Corriganville. A local naturalist, Raymond Armbruster, observed fossil bones among the rocks that had been blasted loose and were being removed from the cut. Armbruster notified paleontologists at the Smithsonian Institution, and James W. Gidley began excavating that same year. The cave later became known as the Cumberland Bone Cave. Between 1912 and 1916, Gidley excavated the Cumberland Bone Cave, where 41 genera of mammals were found, about 16 per cent of which are extinct. Numerous excellent skulls and enough bones to reconstruct skeletons for a number of the species were present. Skeletons of the Pleistocene cave bear and an extinct saber-toothed cat from the Bone Cave are on permanent exhibit in the Ice Age Mammal exhibit at the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.. Many of the fossilized bones date from 200,000 years ago. The Cumberland Bone cave represents one of the finest Pleistocene-era faunas known from eastern North America.

It is similar to the more common lancewood, Pseudopanax crassifolius, but with more prominently tooth-shaped leaves. The juvenile leaves are a very dark grey-brown to grey- green colour, narrow, stiff and up to 40 cm long. Once the slow growing tree reaches maturity at 10 to 15 years, the leaf form becomes shorter, wider and dark green in colour. It is only in adulthood that the tree's shape changes from one central stem and downward growing leaves to a more typical tree shape with branches spreading to build a round head. A mature toothed lancewood can reach 6 metres height with a trunk of up to 25 cm in diameter. The mature trunk has distinctive longitudinal grooves which sometimes twist slightly. The tree is sometimes also called fierce lancewood in reference to its fierce looking saw tooth shaped juvenile leaves. Use Toothed lancewood used to be rare in cultivation, but is now a favoured gardening plant in New Zealand. It gained wide popularity following its use in the gold-medal winning New Zealand exhibit at the 2004 Chelsea Flower Show in the UK. The distinctive leaves and juvenile shape lend themselves to use in narrow spaces and are often used to complement modern building architecture. Due to its slow growth and relatively small size for a tree ‚Äì even once mature ‚Äì it is one of few trees innately suitable for small gardens. Planting Planting is best done in free draining soil in any semi-shaded to sunny position. Leaves are more numerous in sunny situations, which is noticeable on young specimens. Toothed lancewood is generally hardy and can withstand some minor frost damage to the tip (which may cause it to branch). It is also tolerant of dry locations and high winds.

The road has existed since at least 1937, when it connected U.S. Route 40 (US-40) and US-50 via the Garfield Cut-Off Road. It also serves as the eastbound on-ramp for I-80. Route description Located entirely in Salt Lake County, Utah, SR-202 begins at an intersection with SR-201 and 11500 West northwest of Magna, Utah. The road travels northwesterly, bordered on the east by a large tailing pond owned by Kennecott Utah Copper and part of the former Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad rail line, which is now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad (UP). The parallel rail line intersects a pair of east‚Äìwest rail lines, the southern line being UP main line, and the northern line being the Feather River Route of the former Western Pacific Railroad, which is now owned by UP. After crossing the rail lines, SR-202 intersects with I-80 near the Great Salt Lake State Park and comes to a terminus at the I-80 frontage road, which provides access to the Great Salt Lake State Park and to the Saltair resort. Kennecott Utah Copper owns all of the land surrounding SR-202, except for the right-of-way for the railroad, and the highway itself. SR-202 serves as the eastbound ramp from SR-201 onto Interstate I-80, because at its intersection with I-80, the SR-201 (which is the southern terminus of SR-202) traffic only has the option to continue on I-80 westbound, and does not have an offramp to eastbound I-80. Traffic on SR-202 has increased 12% between 2002 and 2007, with a daily average of 735 cars per day using SR-202 in 2007, compared to 475 cars per day in 2002. Half of the traffic on SR-202 consists of buses and trucks. History Two other roads have been designated Utah State Route 202 in the past. From 1939 to 1953, the name was used by the road that formed the eastern approach to Mercur, Utah and later became part of SR-73. From 1961 to 1967, the name was used by Main Street between SR-201 (2100 South) and SR-171 in downtown Salt Lake City, which is now part of Utah State Route 186. The road that currently carries the SR-202 designation has existed since 1937, when it connected US-40 and US-50 along the Garfield Cut-Off Road. The Utah State Legislature designated the road SR-202 in 1969, thus taking responsibility of maintaining the road from the county. No changes or alterations have been made to SR-202, except for the legal definition of the road, which has changed twice since it was formed. On September 26, 2008, a sulfuric acid spill occurred, reported by people in vehicles traveling on Interstate 80. In 2015, as part of a federal- aid project, a traffic signal was installed at the junction with SR-201, which was moved slightly to the west; as a result, the south end of SR-202 was realigned, resulting in a net loss of approximately of state highway mileage.

History From its foundation the university was student run, on the Bologna model, but in 1613 the college of professors sent a formal deputy to the archdukes in Brussels, seeking to convert the University to a Magisteruniversit√§t such as Louvain and Douai.

High-altitude medical research The most obvious and direct application of high-altitude research is to understand altitude illnesses such as acute mountain sickness, and the rare but rapidly fatal conditions, high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE). Research at high altitude is also an important way to learn about sea level conditions that are caused or complicated by hypoxia such as chronic lung disease and sepsis. Patients with these conditions are very complex and usually suffer from several other diseases at the same time, so it is virtually impossible to work out which of their problems is caused by lack of oxygen. Altitude research gets round this by studying the effects of oxygen deprivation on otherwise healthy people. Travelling to high altitude is often used as a way of studying the way the body responds to a shortage of oxygen. It is difficult and prohibitively expensive to conduct some of this research at sea level Although the shortage of air contributes to the effects on the human body, research has found that most altitude sicknesses can be linked to the lack of atmospheric pressure. At low elevation, the pressure is higher because the molecules of air are compressed from the weight of the air above them. However, at higher elevations, the pressure is lower and the molecules are more dispersed. The percentage of oxygen in the air at sea level is the same at high altitudes. But because the air molecules are more spread out at higher altitudes, each breath takes in less oxygen to the body. With this in mind, the lungs take in as much air as possible, but because the atmospheric pressure is lower the molecules are more dispersed, resulting in a lower amount of oxygen per breath. At 26,000 feet the body reaches a maximum and can no longer adjust to the altitude, often referred to as the \\"Death Zone\\".

The design of the grand touring-type rear-wheel drive pillarless coupe of monocoque construction with two doors and a truncated rear end treatment was influenced by AMC stylist Dick Teague.  Design development  Front end was from the AMX production car The AMX GT was built by shortening the 4-seat Javelin coup√© to a wheelbase (the same as the production 2-seat AMXs), lowering, or \\"chopping\\", the roof and cutting off the tail. The one-off AMX-GT body used a fiberglass rear and featured side-mounted \\"macho external exhaust pipes.\\" It appeared in two versions. At the New York International Auto Show in April 1968 it was red with a white stripe on the sides that ran across the roof. It also had plain, flush wheel covers, generic all-black tires, a side-mounted exhaust, a ram-air intake hood, integrated roof spoiler and fixed rear side windows (quarter glass) with no support (or \\"B\\") pillar. The wheels were soon replaced by an alloy five-spoke design with Goodyear white-letter tires. The hood and roof were repainted a contrasting dark blue. This color scheme, which followed the major character lines of the car, was applied to some of the early factory- sponsored race cars before AMC changed to bands of red, white and blue.  Legacy  The AMX GT provided several clues to future production models and options. The most immediately available were the optional side exhaust pipes for 1969 Javelins and AMXs. A slightly modified version of the show car's hood scoop became part of the factory production 1970 \\"GO Package\\" option on Javelins and AMXs in 1970.

She transited the Panama Canal on 30 July and, early the next day, rendezvoused with the submarine for exercises en route to the Hawaiian Islands. On 10 August, she parted company and made her way independently to Oahu, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 14 August 1945. After discharging her cargo, she embarked 172 Army troops and departed the Hawaiian Islands on 7 September, setting her course for the New Hebrides. She arrived at Espiritu Santo on the 17th, discharged her passengers, loaded cargo, and embarked elements of the 85th Construction Battalion. On 22 September, she got underway for the Marshalls. After fueling at Eniwetok, she continued on and arrived at Wake Island on 6 October. The following day, she discharged her cargo and passengers and returned to Eniwetok to begin \\"Magic Carpet\\" duties, carrying troops back to the United States. She embarked more than 600 veterans, then got underway on 13 October and steamed via a great circle route to California. On Friday, 26 October, she entered San Pedro Harbor and disembarked her happy passengers. After voyage repairs at Terminal Island, she again got underway on 3 November, steaming for the Marianas. On the 19th, Turandot arrived at Saipan. This time, she was to serve as a magic carpet for more than a thousand returning troops. She departed Saipan on the 27th and completed the crossing at San Pedro on 12 December. Voyage repairs occupied most of the remainder of the month. Turandot opened the new year with a voyage to San Diego; then, on the 24th, continued southward and steamed, via the Panama Canal, to the Atlantic. On 5 February, she arrived at Hampton Roads and was delivered on 25 June 1946 to the Maritime Commission for custody pending disposal. She decommissioned on 21 March 1946 and was struck from the Navy list on 17 April 1947. Recommissioning On 4 November 1954, the former attack cargo ship was reacquired by the Navy to support Project Caesar, the unclassified name for the installation of the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS). The ship was reclassified as a cable repair ship, redesignated ARC-3, and renamed Aeolus. Her conversion was completed on 15 May 1955 at Baltimore by the Key Highway Plant of the Bethlehem Steel Co. The ship was accepted for limited service and re-commissioned later that month.

It broadcast over-the-air on channel 24, and on cable channel 18, 15, 16, and 7 throughout Western North Carolina and Eastern Tennessee. It was an independent station with some national programming from Youtoo America. The station was originally owned by Tim Baxter and Bob Flanagan, who did an excellent job starting the station in the early 1990s and providing local news and show content to the viewers in the High Country. After many years of excellent public service to the local communities, it had become increasingly difficult to financially operate a local television station, and so they sold MTN in 2003 to Steve Rondinaro. Rondinaro had many years of broadcast experience as a news anchor, and he had previously owned a group of successful radio stations in the Boone area. Prior to moving to the Boone area, Rondinaro had been a very successful evening news anchor in Miami, Florida. Rondinaro sold his group of high country radio stations and used these proceeds to purchase MTN in the Fall of 2003. As the television industry changed because of the introduction of cable and satellite networks, resulting in more television stations becoming available to viewers through cable and satellite providers, then local stations such as MTN faced increasing competition for viewers and advertisers. As a result, it became more and more difficult for MTN to survive financially. MTN was losing money every month, and Rondinaro was forced to spend his own money every month to keep the station going. Eventually, he put the station up for sale in 2007. However, with no buyers coming forward throughout 2007 and 2008, and Rondinaro no longer in Boone because of the news anchor position he had taken at WWAY on the East Coast of North Carolina, then MTN was on the brink of closure for two years. Then, just when it appeared that MTN would close, a buyer, Terry Smith, came in at the last minute, and Rondinaro sold WLNN to Terry Smith in 2008. Smith had grown up in the local area before going on to play and coach professional football and baseball, while also previously serving as a teacher and head coach in area schools. Smith‚Äôs motivation was to lead with programming and create a television station that provided coverage of everything that was taking place in Western North Carolina. In addition, his overriding rule in providing this all-inclusive coverage was that MTN would only broadcast positive television shows and positive news coverage. Unlike other stations across the country that usually focus on negative news stories, Smith focused MTN entirely on everything positive and great that was happening in the High Country of Western North Carolina. With this never-ending goal in mind, MTN worked 7 days per week, 24 hours per day, and literally 365 days per year in an effort to cover everything positive that was happening in the region. As a result, MTN produced more hours of its own television content during these years than any other television station in the United States. MTN produced, filmed, directed, hosted, and broadcast more than 100 hours each week of its own programming, including its own Appalachian State University football and basketball game broadcasts, additional college football and basketball game broadcasts, more than 500 high school football, basketball, soccer, baseball, and softball game broadcasts for high schools in the counties of Watauga, Avery, Ashe, Wilkes, Carter, Johnson, Mitchell, Yancey, Madison, and throughout Western North Carolina and Eastern Tennessee, the EndZone football Friday night highlight show, the Appalachian State University ASU Chalktalk football strategy show, nightly newscasts, morning newscasts, a noon show and newscasts, a three hour live morning show with many guests each day from throughout the High Country, a weekly sports highlight show that included coverage of the High Country Heisman contenders, a weekly Appalachian State University sports highlight show, the Avery County Chamber of Commerce Show, the Watauga County Chamber of Commerce Show, the Avery County Schools Show, the Watauga County Schools Show, the Appalachian State University chancellor‚Äôs show, the Ashe County Arts Show, the Watauga County Arts Show, the Good Life of Avery County Show, the Wilkes County Show, the two hour daily live sports call-in show, the These Historic Hills show, live broadcasts of political elections, interviews each election period with all the political candidates running for office, regular interviews with all area state and national in-office congress people and senators, the weekly Seniors of the Month show which highlighted the lives of outstanding citizens who were of senior age in the MTN broadcast area, many hours every week of local affairs programming, and the weekly Veterans‚Äô Voice two hour television show that interviewed and told the life stories of more than 150 World War II veterans, Korean War veterans, Vietnam War veterans, and Gulf War veterans. MTN filmed, produced, and broadcast an average of ten high school and college sports game broadcasts each week throughout the year, utilizing three excellent production teams of camera people and experienced game announcers. The MTN Games of the Week were announced by the outstanding Len Murphy on play-by-play and Terry Smith as the color analyst. Forming a tremendous partnership for many years, Murphy and Smith became synonymous with all of western North Carolina‚Äôs best and most-watched sports broadcasts. MTN also filmed, produced, and directed national television programs such as the ‚ÄúSouthern Fresh‚Äù cooking show that MTN filmed and produced, with Terry Smith directing. Southern Fresh was broadcast on several national cable television networks such as RFD-TV, reaching more than 100 million potential viewers every week. MTN also filmed a stage production of the world-famous ‚ÄúHorn in the West‚Äù outdoor drama that is historically based on the Revolutionary War and on Daniel Boone. Horn in the West has been performed in Boone, North Carolina since 1952. From this filming, and with Terry Smith directing, MTN produced a Horn in the West movie and DVD that was distributed to a nationwide audience. The television program that MTN is most proud of, and which is the most important and most valuable television show that MTN has ever produced and broadcast, was the Veterans‚Äô Voice television show because the Veterans‚Äô Voice program allowed MTN to interview and tell the life stories of more than 150 World War II veterans, as well as interview and tell the life stories of many Korean War veterans, Vietnam War veterans, and Gulf War veterans. The Veterans‚Äô Voice Show was hosted by Terry Smith and by World War II veteran and American hero Ken Wiley. The entire focus of the Veterans‚Äô Voice programs was to honor and show our great respect and appreciation to our World War II ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Greatest Generation‚Äù war heroes, as well as our Korean War, Vietnam War, and Gulf War veteran heroes. Ken served America with great honor during World War II. He is a veteran of seven D-Day invasions in the Pacific Ocean during World War II, where as a coxman he drove a LCVP landing craft full of soldiers onto the beaches of these seven D- Day invasions. Ken, whose four brothers also fought in the war, is also a renowned author who wrote ten highly acclaimed books about World War II, including books that focused on the crucial importance of America pulling together as a country to provide the nationwide ‚ÄúAll For One and One For All‚Äù environment that was necessary for America‚Äôs success in the war. Every Veterans‚Äô Voice show was blessed with having a local war veteran and hero as a special guest. Terry Smith and Ken Wiley interviewed each veteran throughout every show. The two-hour length of the show allowed the very comprehensive interviews to tell the complete life stories of the veterans from when they were young and growing up as a child with their families in the local region, through their incredible war experiences during the war, and on to their post-war careers and present day lives with their families. Each veteran‚Äôs life story was broadcast on MTN throughout a six- state region, and a DVD copy was also given to every family member of each veteran, including a DVD copy given to every son, daughter, wife, brother, sister, grandson, and granddaughter, so that all family members would forever have a permanent copy of their loved one‚Äôs war experiences and life story. The Veteran‚Äôs Voice television show was filmed and broadcast by MTN for eight years, producing more than 150 life stories of our American war heroes. As the show progressed throughout its eight years, the show also brought in additional World War II veterans to serve with Ken and Terry as co-hosts for specific programs, including outstanding World War II heroes HC Moretz, Norman Isenhour, and Sam Wotherspoon. As a result of this total commitment to tell the life stories of our World War II veterans, MTN, Ken, and Terry created the largest and greatest compilation of World War II veteran history and life stories in the world. The benefits of this work for America and for the world will last forever, and copies of all 150 World War II Veterans‚Äô Voice shows are now kept in national museums throughout the United States, as well as being kept in local and regional libraries throughout Western North Carolina and Eastern Tennessee. In addition, a second set of Veterans‚Äô Voice shows were made that were hosted by Keith Buchanan and Terry Smith. Buchanan is a renowned World War II historian who leads historical tours to World War II battlefields throughout Europe. This set of Veterans‚Äô Voice shows told the in- depth stories and details of famous World War II battles, and also told the amazing stories of specific World War II veterans who became American heroes. MTN, Ken Wiley, Terry Smith, and Keith Buchanan also worked together to organize and host two World War II Symposiums, one symposium at Appalachian State University and a second symposium at Watauga High School, in order to recognize and show respect for all our area World War II American heroes, and to provide first person World War II history to citizens throughout our region. Both symposiums recognized and honored all the World War II veterans in our region, and each veteran was an VIP at the symposiums as they were all introduced on stage to the audience, and each veteran had his or her own table for them to meet and sign autographs for symposium attendees. Ken Wiley, HC Moretz, Dorian Moretz, and Terry Smith also worked together to bring World War II history to schools throughout Western North Carolina and Eastern Tennessee, during which Ken and HC spoke to students in school assemblies and classrooms throughout the region, thereby providing first-person historical knowledge of World War II to our young people. In summary, Terry Smith‚Äôs goal of MTN leading with content, along with the dedicated work of MTN on a 365 day per year basis, resulted in MTN producing more hours of television content than any other television station in the United States. When Smith purchased MTN, the station had been broadcasting on only one cable network, and in only two counties. However, after his purchase of MTN, Smith worked very hard to build broadcast partnerships with numerous cable networks throughout the Southeast Region of the United States in order to expand MTN‚Äôs broadcast reach. Through this relentless work, he was able to build MTN into a television station that broadcast to more than 1 million viewers on 16 cable networks in six states, including North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. MTN could also be seen on its over the air broadcast signal that reached a very wide broadcast area in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, and on WTBL-CD in Lenoir. These over the air and second station broadcasts, along with the 16 cable networks that MTN broadcast on, allowed MTN to reach a total of two million viewers in six states. When the television industry moved from being broadcast on an analog over the air signal to a digital broadcast signal, then the FCC decided to benefit citizens by selling some of its television airwave frequencies to wireless telephone carriers in order to free up frequencies that would increase and improve nationwide cell phone and wi-fi capabilities. In order to create this benefit for its citizens, the FCC decided to hold an FCC Incentive Auction. As a result, all television stations in the United States were entered into the FCC Incentive Auction where the FCC looked to purchase over the air television signals from television stations in order to resell these over the air frequencies to wireless phone and wi-if carriers. All television station broadcast signals were given values of importance based upon two primary factors. These two factors were how many people a station‚Äôs over the air broadcast signal reached, and how much interference each station‚Äôs broadcast signal caused to other stations‚Äô broadcast signals in the surrounding region. During Terry Smith‚Äôs tenure at MTN, he had worked hard to create an MTN broadcast signal that increased its broadcast reach to the greatest number of people possible throughout a several state area, and had worked to extend the MTN signal as far and with as much strength as possible into other broadcast signal areas. The result of Smith‚Äôs work was that MTN‚Äôs broadcast signal became more valuable than nearly any comparably-sized television station in America, and as the 208 rounds and 4 stages of the FCC Incentive Auction unfolded over a two year period, the MTN broadcast signal continued to be a necessary part of the FCC‚Äôs wireless auction plan. Even though very few television stations in America remained at the end of the auction after 4 stages and 208 auction rounds, MTN was still needed as one of the auction‚Äôs essential components, and on April 13, 2017, the FCC granted WLNN-CD $21.3 million to go off-the-air as part of the Spectrum auction. On November 30, 2017, the station went silent. The station's license was cancelled by the FCC on November 12, 2018.

Early life and career  Hassan Allam was born in Port Said and subsequently moved to the Upper Egyptian town of Al Minya with his family. His father owned a small shop that sold construction materials including tiles and ceramics imported from Great Britain. Allam attended primary school but did not continue his education, joining his father's business instead. In 1924 at the age of 19, he immigrated to Cairo where he formed a small informal contracting outfit. In 1936, he founded Hassan Mohammed Allam & Co. for General Contracting - a limited partnership company. Despite having received no formal education in the field of construction, his managerial and technical expertise were substantial. He was also widely popular with construction labourers and engineers.  First major contracts  In 1938, King Farouk was on his way to Ismalia when he was injured in a car accident and was whisked to the nearby village of Kassassin to be treated in a small medical facility. As a result of the incident, the King ordered that a hospital be built in the area. Hassan Allam thus landed his first major contract and El Kassaseen Hospital was built on the Cairo-to- Isma√Ølia agricultural road. Other early contracts included the Mebara hospital in Port Said, a power station in Damanhur, and the first Egyptian oil refinery in Suez. His firm was beginning to seriously compete with El Abd Pasha, Ahmad Bakir (a road contractor) and Ali Ibrahim Pasha (whose work include the Television Building and the Tahrir Office Complex in Cairo). Eventually the company became one of the largest in the construction field in the country together with Osman Ahmad Osman's Arab Contractors Co..  An unknowing early supporter of Anwar el-Sadat  Allam unknowingly protected Anwar el-Sadat in his early years. In the 1940s, Sadat in an effort to evade political persecution, disguised himself as a truck driver and took a job in Hassan Allam's company. Sadat later became the third president of Egypt.  Adjusting to political change over the years  After the 1952 revolution, the company continued to thrive and executed a number of major roads such as the Ismalia- Al 'Arish, Suez-Marsa Alam, and Alexandria-Marsa Matruh highways. Many projects were also completed in Port Said that included a large cathedral and a mosque. Prior to the construction of the Aswan High Dam, the company was in charge of building a new community for the Nubian people whose villages lay in the area that was later to become Lake Nasser. In 1961, the company was nationalized under President Gamal Abdel Nasser‚Äôs new socialist policies to become Nasr General Contracting - Hassan Mohammed Allam with Hassan Allam losing ownership and becoming its general manager. In 1975, taking advantage of the Infitah or open-door policies adopted by President Anwar el-Sadat‚Äôs government, he established his second company - Hassan Allam Sons. Shortly after, the new company submitted a bid for building a large sewage network in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. However Hassan Allam did not live to see the result of the bid. His funeral was held at the Omar Makram Mosque in Tahrir Square and was attended by thousands of mourners. The crowd extended from the mosque almost up to the Ramesses Hilton. There are currently two streets named after Hassan Allam; one in the Heliopolis district and the other in Downtown Cairo.

He also wrote under the names Theodore OrchardsStuart Palmer entry at isfdb.org and Jay Stewart. Life Palmer was born in Baraboo, Wisconsin. He \\"was descended from some of the earliest English colonists, [and] had held a variety of jobs including seaman, apple picker, taxi-driver and newspaper reporter before turning to fiction.\\"Haining, Peter, ed. The Television Crimebusters Omnibus. London: Orion, 1994, p. 406. From 1928 to 1931, Palmer was a frequent contributor (sometimes using the pen name Theodore Orchards) to Ghost Stories magazine, writing short stories, essays, and a serialized novel, The Gargoyle's Throat. Palmer tried his hand at writing a murder mystery with The Penguin Pool Murder, published in 1931 and filmed the following year by RKO Radio Pictures. Character actress Edna May Oliver starred as Palmer's heroine, Hildegarde Withers, a spinster schoolteacher who was an amateur sleuth - something of an American version of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple although considerably more comic and caustic. \\"The model for the unusual sleuth had been his high school teacher, a Miss Fern Hakett, he later admitted.\\" The casting of Oliver for the role was a happy coincidence, as Palmer had been influenced by her performance in the Broadway production of Show Boat when creating the character. The film was a hit and Oliver starred in two more Withers films, but she left RKO in 1935. Helen Broderick and ZaSu Pitts played Withers in another three films. A made-for-TV movie, A Very Missing Person was aired in 1972, starring Eve Arden as Withers. \\"The success of his first novel also inspired Palmer to collect pictures and statues of penguins and he even devised a personal trademark featuring one of these birds.\\" Palmer wrote fourteen Hildegarde Withers novels, including Murder on the Blackboard (1932), Murder on Wheels (1932), The Puzzle of the Pepper Tree (1934), Four Lost Ladies (1949), and Cold Poison (1954), set in the thinly disguised Walter Lantz animation studio. The short story collection People vs. Withers and Malone (1963) was a collaboration with Craig Rice, in which Hildegarde Withers was teamed with Rice's hard-drinking lawyer detective J. J. Malone; one of the stories, \\"Once Upon A Train, or The Loco Motive,\\" was the basis for the movie Mrs. O'Malley and Mr. Malone (1950). Hildegarde Withers Makes the Scene (1969) was completed by Fletcher Flora upon Palmer's death and published posthumously. Palmer also featured Withers in dozens of short stories that were published in newspapers and mystery magazines; many of these were collected in The Riddles of Hildegarde Withers (1947), The Monkey Murder (1950), and Hildegarde Withers: Uncollected Riddles (Crippen & Landru, 2002). Outside the Hildegarde Withers series, Stuart wrote two novels about newspaperman-turned-PI Howard Rook, Unhappy Hooligan (1956) and Rook Takes Knight (1968). He also wrote a handful of science fiction and fantasy stories, published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and Fantastic Universe. Palmer also had a career as a Hollywood screenwriter. In 1936, he penned his first screenplay and would go on to write several others, most of them B movies. He scripted the first three Bulldog Drummond films for Paramount, and later entries in Columbia's Lone Wolf and RKO's The Falcon series. In 1954, Palmer appeared as a contestant on Groucho Marx's TV show You Bet Your Life. \\"The Adventure of the Remarkable Worm\\" was a humorous Sherlock Holmes pastiche that was published in Ellery Queen's The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes in 1944. In 1950, another pastiche \\"The Adventure of the Marked Man\\" was published in Australian Women's Weekly: the pastiche takes the detective Sherlock Holmes and his companion Dr. Watson to the seaside town of Penzance in Cornwall, where they investigate the strange warnings given to Allen Pendarvis and a subsequent attempt on his life.Included in The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes \\"The two pastiches, one serious and one comic, were written while Palmer was marooned at an army post in Oklahoma, where he was serving as an instructor.‚Ä¶.\\"\\"Introduction\\" to The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Stuart Palmer also wrote \\"The Mystery of David Lang\\" for Fate Magazine. Somehow, though quoted in hundreds of collections about supposedly true weird and occult mysteries it wasn't until long after Mr. Palmer's death that someone finally realized that the affidavits signed by David Lang's daughter and the local Justice of the Peace both testifying to the truth of the story were in Mr. Palmer's handwriting (including the signatures). David Lang, gentleman farmer, didn't find it too difficult to disappear while walking across his field because he had never existed. Anymore than his daughter or the JP.

Located at 15 Wall Street (erroneously listed as 9 Main Street on the Amtrak timetable and the Amtrak official website), the station consists of a covered platform on the northwest side of the northeast-southwest tracks, a small parking lot, and a building. The building is mostly boarded up, but it does have a small waiting room for Amtrak passengers. It also contains a freight depot. Both the station and the freight house were originally built by the Charleston and Western Carolina Railway. The current station house was built around 1955 as a replacement for several other stations in the past. The station was later run by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. Yemassee is served by the Palmetto and Silver Meteor trains of Amtrak's Silver Service. Both trains pass through Yemassee, near the growing towns of Beaufort and Hilton Head, at roughly the same times of the day; the northbound Palmetto and southbound Silver Meteor do so in the morning, while the southbound Palmetto and northbound Silver Meteor come through in the evening. From 1915 to 1965, the Yemassee station was the first place where potential United States Marines recruits stopped before reaching Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island. Many Marines that fought in wars and conflicts spanning World War I through Vietnam began their careers at the train station.http://www.marines.mil/Photos.aspx?igphoto=2000950986 The town is in the process of purchasing the station from Amtrak as part of a local revitalization effort.

He received America's highest military decoration - the Medal of Honor - for actions during the American intervention at Veracruz, Mexico. Biography Abraham DeSomer was born on December 29, 1884, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In the early 1900s, he enlisted in the United States Navy from that state. Following his initial sea duty on board the gunboat in the Philippines, DeSomer transferred to the monitor , which served on the Asiatic Station, and became a Gunner's Mate. From 1907 to 1911, he was assigned to the battleship . DeSomer was promoted to Chief Petty Officer in 1910. A year later, he reported to the battleship . While serving on that ship from 21‚Äì22 April 1914, during the intervention at Veracruz, Mexico, his \\"extraordinary herosim in the line of his profession\\" was recognized by the award of the Medal of Honor. In February 1915 DeSomer was promoted to the Warrant Officer rank of Gunner. During the next four years he served on the transport , the armored cruiser and the battleship . He was temporarily commissioned as an Ensign in August 1917 and attained the rank of Lieutenant in September 1918. In the Spring of 1919, DeSomer transferred to Naval Training Center, Great Lakes, Illinois. He was made a permanent Lieutenant in August 1920 and, a year later, reported to the newly commissioned battleship . DeSomer began two more years of training duty at Great Lakes in the summer of 1925, then was assigned to the destroyer tender and the aircraft carrier before transferring in November 1930 to Naval Air Station, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Following more than thirty years of continuous service as an enlisted man and an officer, Lieutenant DeSomer retired in January 1932. He returned to active duty in the summer of 1940, after the fall of France prompted a massive expansion of America's defenses. Promoted to Lieutenant Commander on the retired list in February 1942, he remained on active status through the war years. Abraham DeSomer died on August 31, 1974, and is buried at the San Francisco National Cemetery, San Francisco, California. Description of Medal of Honor Action In a letter dated 13 June 1914 to DeSomer, Josephus Daniels quoted Admiral F. F. Fletcher's summary of DeSomer's actions on 21‚Äì22 April 1914: > On the afternoon of April 21st, [DeSomer] was placed in charge of a small > squad of men and stationed at the corner of a warehouse to eastward of the > custom house. His position was subject to a severe fire from the buildings > along Avenida Inadero y Cos, and after several hours of well directed fire > he silenced it. On April 22d when a general advance began, he was sent ahead > to locate and silence fire from snipers. Being an excellent marksman and > notably cool, he was especially selected for this work. Later, when two > sections of artillery were sent to join Captain Anderson's command, he > performed similar services and was almost continually under direct fire from > snipers.

History = FM RSL broadcasts  From 2002 to 2010 (inclusive) the station used to broadcast under a Restricted Service Licence (RSL) on 87.9 FM every August 1‚Äì28. Since the last RSL in August 2010, the frequency has also been used by local radio station Wycombe Sound for a few of their RSLs, where older members from the Blink team often went to continue their radio career.  Online broadcasting  When the station stopped FM broadcasting, it moved to online broadcasting through their website. This broadcast was intermittently available from August 2010 when the last RSL broadcast ended until 2012. In late August 2012, volunteers at the station made the online broadcast available 24/7 through the Blink FM website. However, since Wycombe Youth Action moved building in early 2016, the station no longer broadcasts online and now appears to have become an abandoned project.  Live events  In 2015, the volunteer team also held two separate and popular music events live, coined Blink Live and Blink Live 2, to raise money to buy new equipment for the station. The money raised was given to Wycombe Youth Action who managed the radio station, its equipment and volunteers.  Broadcast information  Blink FM's studio was based in High Wycombe, last based at the Apollo Center, also the home of Wycombe Youth Action. The team used high quality mixing desks and microphones to present the show live, aided by Myriad studio playlist software to cue the music. When a volunteer presenter (often part of Wycombe Youth Action) wasn't live, studio software broadcast an automatically generated playlist 24/7. During the FM broadcasts, radios in the local area around Blink could tune it to 87.9 FM to listen to the station live. An online broadcast was also available for some of the station's history, available via their website.

The band is known for its bold combination of traditional Chinese instruments with solid rock & roll fundamentals. The influence of traditional Chinese folk music can be clearly felt in the singing of leadsinger Liang Long and the usage of traditional Chinese instruments in both their recordings and live performances. Their debut album, the self-titled Second Hand Rose Band, was released in 2004 to critical acclaim in China's bigger cities. The album also received rave reviews on specialist music websites in the U.S. The group was formed in August 2000. Before the release of their second album the band were known as \\"Second Hand Rose Band\\", but the word \\"band\\" was dropped with the release of their second album and they are now merely known as \\"Second Hand Rose\\". Over the years, the line-up of the band has changed frequently. Lead singer Liang Long and Chinese traditional instrument player Wu Zekun are the only two band members who are with the band since it was formed. Other band members seem to come and go, although guitar player Yao Lan has been with the band for several years by now. Liang long has all the characteristics of a northeast Chinese man. He is tall, broad and straightforward. The only difference is that he has the habit of dressing up like a woman on stage. Nowadays he seemed to have dropped this way of dressing, and often wears more conventional clothes during performances. The fact that he shaved off his long hair also takes away most of his former drag-act. Nonetheless, his long hails from the Heilongjiang province in northeast China, his stage antics and flamboyant look have earned the band controversy in their native China. In 2002, Second Hand Rose became the only foreign band to be invited to play at the Swiss Snow Mountain Music Festival, an annual event attracting some of Switzerland's established musical names. They were also one of the few Chinese rock bands invited to perform in Shanghai at the 2003 China-Japan Pop Music Exchange Concerts, an event organized by Japan's public broadcaster NHK. When the Amsterdam China Festival was held in the Netherlands in 2004, Second Hand Rose was also one of the bands invited. The band (Liang Long with a new line- up) released their second album in late 2006. The album, titled Yu Le Jiang Hu (Â®±‰πêÊ±üÊπñ), contains ten new studio recordings that have been well received by the specialist and online press in Mainland China. The video clip to the first single, ÁãºÂøÉÁãóËÇ∫, was also included on the release. The band is often performing in Beijing, but tours to other Chinese cities to perform as well.

He participated in the 1953 attack on Moncada Barracks that jump-started the Cuban Revolution against then-leader Fulgencio Batista, where he suffered a gunshot wound to the back that partially disabled his right leg and left him a legacy of lifelong pain. Freed under a pardon, Arcos spent the next several years gathering support, money, and munitions throughout Mexico, South America, and the United States. Following the success of the revolution in 1959, Arcos became Cuba's ambassador to Belgium. However, while Arcos was away, he grew disillusioned both by Cuba's alliance with the Soviet Union, and what he saw to be the dictatorial tendencies of Fidel Castro. Upon his return, he began expressing dissent against Castro and the Cuban government. In response, he was arrested and sentenced to 10 years as a counterrevolutionary. He was released after a long hunger strike in 1969, but his request to leave the country was refused. An illegal attempt to leave the country put Arcos in jail again in 1981.

A franchise tax is not based on income. Rather, the typical franchise tax calculation is based on the net worth of or capital held by the entity. The franchise tax effectively charges corporations for the privilege of doing business in the state. Nexus Whether or not a business must pay a franchise tax to a state in which it does business can cause some confusion. Some states report using both the economic and physical presence tests, and in some states, there are no written, public interpretations of their test at all.Baker Tilly, 2016 Midyear State and Local Tax Update. http://www.bakertilly.com/insights/midyear-state-and-local-tax-update-income- and-franchise-taxes/ Physical presence test The physical presence test is based on Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, ( 504 U.S. 298 (1992)), a United States Supreme Court ruling concerning use tax. Quill Corporation is an office supply retailer. Quill had no physical presence in North Dakota (neither a sales force, nor a retail outlet), but it had a licensed computer software program that some of its North Dakota customers used for checking Quill's current inventories and placing orders directly. North Dakota attempted to impose a use tax on Quill, which was struck down by the Supreme Court, because Quill had no physical presence in North Dakota. The Quill physical presence test is used by some states to determine whether or not a company must pay franchise tax. Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Texas report using the physical presence test. Economic presence test Many states apply an \\"economic presence\\" test to determine whether a business will be subject to state sales or franchise tax. This test, which seems to contradict Quill, implied that States have the right to tax or \\"nexus\\" solely on the basis that a company has sales or otherwise derives an economic benefit from activities within their borders. Amount About half the U.S. states do not impose a franchise tax.Journal of Accountancy, Navigating Nexus. http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2010/nov/20102904.html For states that have a franchise tax, the amount is often either a flat fee or based on the size of the business's total holdings.

It was founded in 1871 by Robert Cunningham and Thomas Hankin (father of the interpreter Constance Cox) and was for a time the largest settlement in the region. During its heyday it was home to an ethnic mix of European-Canadians, Japanese-Canadians, and members of First Nations from throughout the region, especially Tsimshians from the Kitselas and Kitsumkalum tribes. In the Tsimshian language, the site of Port Essington is called Spaksuut or, in English spelling, \\"Spokeshute\\", which means \\"autumn camping place\\". This also became the Tsimshian name for the town of Port Essington, and was conferred on Spokeshute Mountain, which stands above and behind the community. It sits on the traditional territory of the Gitzax≈Çaa≈Ç tribe, one of the nine Tsimshian tribes based at Lax Kw'alaams. In 1888, the anthropologist Franz Boas visited Port Essington, interviewing Haida and Tsimshian individuals and establishing a working relationship with Odille Morison, the Tsimshian linguist, who lived in Port Essington. History In 1871, at the height of the Omineca Gold Rush, one route to the new goldfields led up the Skeena River to Hazelton, overland to Babine Lake and on to the Omineca River. The Provincial Government granted Robert Cunningham and Thomas Hankin the right to build a toll road from Hazelton to Babine Lake, while William Moore was placed in charge of the running pack mules on the trail. Cunningham and Hankin took out a pre-emption on the south bank of the Skeena River and set aside a portion of the property for the use of the local First Nations, while subdividing the rest for into lots which were sold to settlers. The Hudson's Bay Company bought three lots that summer and built a store that became known as the Skeena Post. In 1876 the first salmon cannery was built and by the turn of the century there were seven canneries near the estuary. Robert Cunningham built a hotel, a town hall as well as the first cold storage plant in the north, which began operating in 1892. The town had an active social life with dances, concerts and church activities as well as three hotels and a red-light district. However, despite the appearance of prosperity, the economy of Port Essington fluctuated with the seasons. Salmon fishing was a summer activity and the river was closed for freighting in the winter so many of the residents would migrate south each fall. According to Harris (see below), in the early twentieth century Port Essington's population fluctuated between around 1,000 and, in the winter months, about a quarter of that. The town was almost wiped out by fire in 1899, with only one building remaining. Port Essington's importance as a town began to wane when the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway along the Skeena was completed in 1914, on the opposite bank from Port Essington. Rail supplanted the riverboat commerce that had been the community's lifeblood. By the 1940s, all of Port Essington's canneries were inactive. Through the 1950s the population plummeted. Port Essington burned down in a series of fires in 1961 and 1965 and is now a ghost town (despite its continuing to appear as a populated settlement in many maps and atlases). It sits today on an Indian reserve jointly administered by the Kitselas and Kitsumkalum bands. Currently, there are attempts to shape what remains of Port Essington into a tourist attraction. Captain Vancouver named it for Sir William Essington .

Stalag is an abbreviation of the German Stammlager (\\"Main Camp\\"). It was located north-east of the town of M√ºhlberg in the prussian Province of Saxony, just east of the Elbe river and about north of Dresden. From 1944 to 1945 it belonged to the Province of Halle-Merseburg. Now, the area is in Brandenburg. A sub-camp, sometimes identified as Stalag IV-B/Z,Stalag 304 or Stalag IV-H was located at Zeithain, to the south in Saxony.  Stalag IV-B M√ºhlberg  The camp, covering about , was opened in September 1939. The first inmates were about 17,000 Polish soldiers captured in the German September 1939 offensive. For the first two months they dwelt under the open sky or in tents. Most of them were transferred further to other camps. In May 1940 the first French soldiers arrived, taken prisoner in the Battle of France. In 1941 British, and Australian soldiers arrived after the fall of Greece, and later in the year Russian POWs from the invasion of the Soviet Union. In September 1943, further numbers of British, ANZAC, and South African soldiers, previously captive in Italy, arrived after the Italian capitulation. In October 1944 several thousand Poles arrived, members of the Armia Krajowa (\\"Home Army\\") captured after the Warsaw Uprising, including several hundred women soldiers. In November 1944 the Polish women were transferred to other camps, mainly Stalag IV-E (Altenburg) and Oflag IX-C (Molsdorf). At the end of December 1944 about 7,500 Americans arrived from the Battle of the Bulge. At least 3,000 of them were transferred to other camps, mostly to Stalag VIII-A. On 23 April 1945 the Red Army liberated the camp. Altogether soldiers from 33 nations passed through the camp. Camp publications The British prisoners published two periodicals: the wall newspapers The New Times and a richly illustrated Flywheel. The Flywheel was founded by Tom Swallow, and comprised pages from school exercise-books that carried hand-written articles with colour illustrations from whatever inks the editorial team could produce from stolen materials, like quinine from the medical room; these were stuck into place with fermented millet soup, kept from the meagre camp rations. One copy per issue was produced, to be circulated among members throughout the camp. When extracts were published in hardback format in 1987, the book ran to two reprints. An additional periodical, The Observer was published between December 1943 and May 1944. The camp's Welsh soldiers also created their own periodical called Cymro (\\"Welshman\\"), edited by prisoner William John Pitt. The magazines were produced between July 1943 and December 1944. Eight issues of the magazines were created, and out of these one was lost in the camp. Although most of the issues are in English, two pages are in Welsh. The manuscript was bought by The National Library of Wales at Sotheby‚Äôs in 1987. From March 1944 to December 1944 the Scottish prisoners were served with their own papers, The Scotsman and The Scotsman Special Sports Supplement, edited, printed and illustrated in both colour and black and white by RAF pilot Warrant Officer Matthew MacSwan Robertson. The articles were written by the editor and other prisoners and concentrated primarily on Scottish matters, camp social life and the various sports events held in the camp. The Scotsman had seven issues and the Sports had twelve issues. Only one copy of each issue was produced and the papers were taken from hut to hut between publications for all to read. Soviet control When the Soviet Army arrived at the camp in April 1945, there were about 30,000 crowded into the facilities, of these 7,250 were British. About 3,000 died, mainly from tuberculosis and typhus. They were buried in the cemetery in neighbouring Neuburxdorf, Bad Liebenwerda. Today a memorial and a museum commemorate them. The Soviet liberators held the British and American prisoners in the camp for over a month. Individual soldiers \\"escaped\\" from the camp and made their way on foot to the American lines. In August 1945 the Soviet secret police NKVD opened on the area of Stalag IV-B one of its special camps No. 1 using the shacks of Stalag IV-B. More than 22,800 persons were imprisoned and over 6,700 of them died until operation of the camp was ceased in 1948.  Stalag IV-B Zeithain  The sub- camp, originally Stalag 304 (Stalag IV-H), was built in April 1941 next to the military depot, training ground, and Jacobsthal railway station, to accommodate Soviet prisoners. In 1942 it became Stalag IV-B Zeithain, a sub- camp of Stalag IV-B M√ºhlberg. By July 1941 about 11,000 Soviet soldiers, and some officers, had arrived, but by April 1942 only 3,279 remained. The rest had died from malnutrition and a typhus epidemic caused by the deplorable sanitary conditions. The bodies were buried in mass graves. After April 1942 more Soviet prisoners arrived and died just as rapidly. At the end of 1942 10,000 reasonably healthy Soviet prisoners were transferred to Belgium to work in the coal mines. In February 1943 Zeithain was transformed into a hospital camp designated Stalag IV-B/H. The main part still housed Soviet prisoners suffering from tuberculosis, who continued to die at the rate 10-20 per day (according to German sources). The section closest to the railway station was now used to house sick prisoners of other nationalities. These included several hundred Poles and Yugoslavs brought from other camps. In September 1943 a section was set aside for sick Italian soldiers imprisoned after Marshal Badoglio surrendered to the Allies. About 900 died but, in contrast to the Soviet prisoners, they were buried in individual graves in a military cemetery in Jacobsthal. In October 1944, around 25 huts of the Italian section were separated into a special enclosure to house about 1,100 wounded survivors, men and women, of the Polish Armia Krajowa (\\"Home Army\\") that had fought in the Warsaw Uprising for 63 days; as well as the medical personnel - 55 doctors and 168 nurses - to care for them. A train also brought hospital equipment and supplies salvaged from the ruins of Warsaw and the families of the doctors. The Camp Commandant, Colonel Doctor Stachel observed the families with children, and even pets, descending from the train, and walked away in disgust. German sources quote that \\"..the nurses and other staff went to work with great dedication, and achieved a standard of hygiene that had never been seen before in Zeithain.\\" This was probably the only POW camp in the world housing both men and women, and in which eleven babies were born and assigned POW registration numbers. The Red Army liberated the camp on 23 April 1945.  Memorials  The memorial to the victims of Stalag IV-B is situated at the POW cemetery in Neuburxdorf near Bad Liebenwerda. The local community has built a memorial to the victims of Stalag IV-B Zeithain in a Memorial Grove (Gedenkst√§tte Ehrenhain Zeithain) near the station, with a museum. The camp site of Stalag IV-B has also been transformed to a memorial area with glass steles explaining the history of the camp.\\"Glasstelen erinnern an Opfer zweier Diktaturen.\\" Lausitzer Rundschau. 24 April 2012.

It comprises three main methodologies: the modeling of psychological and biological systems in a holistic manner that considers the mind and body as a single entity; the formation of a common set of general principles of intelligent behavior; and the experimental use of robotic agents in controlled environments.  Contributors  Embodied cognitive science borrows heavily from embodied philosophy and the related research fields of cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Contributors to the field include: * From the perspective of neuroscience, Gerald Edelman of the Neurosciences Institute at La Jolla, the late Francisco Varela of CNRS in France, and J. A. Scott Kelso of Florida Atlantic University * From the perspective of psychology, Michael Turvey, Lawrence Barsalou and Eleanor Rosch * From the perspective of language acquisition, Eric Lenneberg and Philip Rubin at Haskins Laboratories * From the perspective of autonomous agent design, early work is sometimes attributed to Rodney Brooks or Valentino Braitenberg * From the perspective of artificial intelligence, Understanding Intelligence by Rolf Pfeifer and Christian Scheier or How the Body Shapes the Way We Think, by Rolf Pfeifer and Josh C. Bongard * From the perspective of philosophy, Andy Clark, Shaun Gallagher, and Evan Thompson In 1950, Alan Turing proposed that a machine may need a human-like body to think and speak:  Traditional cognitive theory  Embodied cognitive science is an alternative theory to cognition in which it minimizes appeals to computational theory of mind in favor of greater emphasis on how an organism's body determines how and what it thinks. Traditional cognitive theory is based mainly around symbol manipulation, in which certain inputs are fed into a processing unit that produces an output. These inputs follow certain rules of syntax, from which the processing unit finds semantic meaning. Thus, an appropriate output is produced. For example, a human's sensory organs are its input devices, and the stimuli obtained from the external environment are fed into the nervous system which serves as the processing unit. From here, the nervous system is able to read the sensory information because it follows a syntactic structure, thus an output is created. This output then creates bodily motions and brings forth behavior and cognition. Of particular note is that cognition is sealed away in the brain, meaning that mental cognition is cut off from the external world and is only possible by the input of sensory information.  The embodied cognitive approach  Embodied cognitive science differs from the traditionalist approach in that it denies the input-output system. This is chiefly due to the problems presented by the Homunculus argument, which concluded that semantic meaning could not be derived from symbols without some kind of inner interpretation. If some little man in a person's head interpreted incoming symbols, then who would interpret the little man's inputs? Because of the specter of an infinite regress, the traditionalist model began to seem less plausible. Thus, embodied cognitive science aims to avoid this problem by defining cognition in three ways.  Physical attributes of the body  The first aspect of embodied cognition examines the role of the physical body, particularly how its properties affect its ability to think. This part attempts to overcome the symbol manipulation component that is a feature of the traditionalist model. Depth perception for instance can be better explained under the embodied approach due to the sheer complexity of the action. Depth perception requires that the brain detect the disparate retinal images obtained by the distance of the two eyes. In addition, body and head cues complicate this further. When the head is turned in a given direction, objects in the foreground will appear to move against objects in the background. From this, it is said that some kind of visual processing is occurring without the need of any kind of symbol manipulation. This is because the objects appearing to move the foreground are simply appearing to move. This observation concludes then that depth can be perceived with no intermediate symbol manipulation necessary. A more poignant example exists through examining auditory perception. Generally speaking the greater the distance between the ears, the greater the possible auditory acuity. Also relevant is the amount of density in between the ears, for the strength of the frequency wave alters as it passes through a given medium. The brain's auditory system takes these factors into account as it process information, but again without any need for a symbolic manipulation system. This is because the distance between the ears for example does not need symbols to represent it. The distance itself creates the necessary opportunity for greater auditory acuity. The amount of density between the ears is similar, in that it is the actual amount itself that simply forms the opportunity for frequency alteration. Thus under consideration of the physical properties of the body, a symbolic system is unnecessary and an unhelpful metaphor.  The body's role in the cognitive process  The second aspect draws heavily from George Lakoff's and Mark Johnson's work on concepts. They argued that humans use metaphors whenever possible to better explain their external world. Humans also have a basic stock of concepts in which other concepts can be derived from. These basic concepts include spatial orientations such as up, down, front, and back. Humans can understand what these concepts mean because they can directly experience them from their own bodies. For example, because human movement revolves around standing erect and moving the body in an up-down motion, humans innately have these concepts of up and down. Lakoff and Johnson contend this is similar with other spatial orientations such as front and back too. As mentioned earlier, these basic stocks of spatial concepts are the basis in which other concepts are constructed. Happy and sad for instance are seen now as being up or down respectively. When someone says they are feeling down, what they are really saying is that they feel sad for example. Thus the point here is that true understanding of these concepts is contingent on whether one can have an understanding of the human body. So the argument goes that if one lacked a human body, they could not possibly know what up or down could mean, or how it could relate to emotional states. While this does not mean that such beings would be incapable of expressing emotions in other words, it does mean that they would express emotions differently from humans. Human concepts of happiness and sadness would be different because human would have different bodies. So then an organism's body directly affects how it can think, because it uses metaphors related to its body as the basis of concepts.  Interaction of local environment  A third component of the embodied approach looks at how agents use their immediate environment in cognitive processing. Meaning, the local environment is seen as an actual extension of the body's cognitive process. The example of a personal digital assistant (PDA) is used to better imagine this. Echoing functionalism (philosophy of mind), this point claims that mental states are individuated by their role in a much larger system. So under this premise, the information on a PDA is similar to the information stored in the brain. So then if one thinks information in the brain constitutes mental states, then it must follow that information in the PDA is a cognitive state too. Consider also the role of pen and paper in a complex multiplication problem. The pen and paper are so involved in the cognitive process of solving the problem that it seems ridiculous to say they are somehow different from the process, in very much the same way the PDA is used for information like the brain. Another example examines how humans control and manipulate their environment so that cognitive tasks can be better performed. Leaving one's car keys in a familiar place so they aren't missed for instance, or using landmarks to navigate in an unfamiliar city. Thus, humans incorporate aspects of their environment to aid in their cognitive functioning.  Examples of the value of embodied approach  The value of the embodiment approach in the context of cognitive science is perhaps best explained by Andy Clark. He makes the claim that the brain alone should not be the single focus for the scientific study of cognition The following examples used by Clark will better illustrate how embodied thinking is becoming apparent in scientific thinking.  Bluefin tuna  Thunnus, or tuna, long baffled conventional biologists with its incredible abilities to accelerate quickly and attain great speeds. A biological examination of the tuna shows that it should not be capable of such feats. However, an answer can be found when taking the tuna's embodied state into account. The bluefin tuna is able to take advantage of and exploit its local environment by finding naturally occurring currents to increase its speed. The tuna also uses its own physical body for this end as well, by utilizing its tailfin to create the necessary vortices and pressure so it can accelerate and maintain high speeds. Thus, the bluefin tuna is actively using its local environment for its own ends through the attributes of its physical body.  Robots  Clark uses the example of the hopping robot constructed by Raibert and Hodgins to demonstrate further the value of the embodiment paradigm. These robots were essentially vertical cylinders with a single hopping foot. The challenge of managing the robot's behavior can be daunting because in addition to the intricacies of the program itself, there were also the mechanical matters regarding how the foot ought to be constructed so that it could hop. An embodied approach makes it easier to see that in order for this robot to function, it must be able to exploit its system to the fullest. That is, the robot's systems should be seen as having dynamic characteristics as opposed to the traditional view that it is merely a command center that just executes actions.  Vision  Clark distinguishes between two kinds of vision, animate and pure vision. Pure vision is an idea that is typically associated with classical artificial intelligence, in which vision is used to create a rich world model so that thought and reason can be used to fully explore the inner model. In other words, pure vision passively creates the external perceivable world so that the faculties of reason can be better used introspectively. Animate vision, by contrast, sees vision as the means by which real-time action can commence. Animate vision is then more of a vehicle by which visual information is obtained so that actions can be undertaken. Clark points to animate vision as an example of embodiment, because it uses both biological and local environment cues to create an active intelligent process. Consider the Clark's example of going to the drugstore to buy some Kodak film. In one's mind, one is familiar with the Kodak logo and its trademark gold color. Thus, one uses incoming visual stimuli to navigate around the drugstore until one finds the film. Therefore, vision should not be seen as a passive system but rather an active retrieval device that intelligently uses sensory information and local environmental cues to perform specific real-world actions.  Affordance  Inspired by the work of the American psychologist James J. Gibson, this next example emphasizes the importance of action-relevant sensory information, bodily movement, and local environment cues. These three concepts are unified by the concept of affordances, which are possibilities of action provided by the physical world to a given agent. These are in turn determined by the agent's physical body, capacities, and the overall action-related properties of the local environment as well. Clark uses the example of an outfielder in baseball to better illustrate the concept of affordance. Traditional computational models would claim that an outfielder attempting to catch a fly-ball can be calculated by variables such as the running speed of the outfielder and the arc of the baseball. However, Gibson's work shows that a simpler method is possible. The outfielder can catch the ball so long as they adjust their running speed so that the ball continually moves in a straight line in their field of vision. Note that this strategy uses various affordances that are contingent upon the success of the outfielder, including their physical body composition, the environment of the baseball field, and the sensory information obtained by the outfielder. Clark points out here that the latter strategy of catching the ball as opposed to the former has significant implications for perception. The affordance approach proves to be non-linear because it relies upon spontaneous real-time adjustments. On the contrary, the former method of computing the arc of the ball is linear as it follows a sequence of perception, calculation and performing action. Thus, the affordance approach challenges the traditional view of perception by arguing against the notion that computation and introspection are necessary. Instead, it ought to be replaced with the idea that perception constitutes a continuous equilibrium of action adjustment between the agent and the world. Ultimately Clark does not expressly claim this is certain but he does observe the affordance approach can explain adaptive response satisfactorily. This is because they utilize environmental cues made possible by perceptual information that is actively used in the real-time by the agent.  General principles of intelligent behavior  In the formation of general principles of intelligent behavior, Pfeifer intended to be contrary to older principles given in traditional artificial intelligence. The most dramatic difference is that the principles are applicable only to situated robotic agents in the real world, a domain where traditional artificial intelligence showed the least promise. Principle of cheap design and redundancy: Pfeifer realized that implicit assumptions made by engineers often substantially influence a control architecture's complexity.Pfeifer, R., Scheier, C., Understanding Intelligence (MIT Press, 2001) This insight is reflected in discussions of the scalability problem in robotics. The internal processing needed for some bad architectures can grow out of proportion to new tasks needed of an agent. The proposed solutions are to have the agent exploit the inherent physics of its environment, to exploit the constraints of its niche, and to have agent morphology based on parsimony and the principle of Redundancy. Redundancy reflects the desire for the error- correction of signals afforded by duplicating like channels. Additionally, it reflects the desire to exploit the associations between sensory modalities. (See redundant modalities). In terms of design, this implies that redundancy should be introduced with respect not only to one sensory modality but to several. It has been suggested that the fusion and transfer of knowledge between modalities can be the basis of reducing the size of the sense data taken from the real world.Konijn, Paul (2007). Summer Workshop on Multi- Sensory Modalities in Cognitive Science Detection and Identification of Rare Audiovisual Cues. DIRAC EU IP IST project, Switzerland. This again addresses the scalability problem. Principle of parallel, loosely-coupled processes: An alternative to hierarchical methods of knowledge and action selection. This design principle differs most importantly from the Sense-Think-Act cycle of traditional AI. Since it does not involve this famous cycle, it is not affected by the frame problem. Principle of sensory-motor coordination: Ideally, internal mechanisms in an agent should give rise to things like memory and choice-making in an emergent fashion, rather than being prescriptively programmed from the beginning. These kinds of things are allowed to emerge as the agent interacts with the environment. The motto is, build fewer assumptions into the agent's controller now, so that learning can be more robust and idiosyncratic in the future. Principle of ecological balance: This is more a theory than a principle, but its implications are widespread. Its claim is that the internal processing of an agent cannot be made more complex unless there is a corresponding increase in complexity of the motors, limbs, and sensors of the agent. In other words, the extra complexity added to the brain of a simple robot will not create any discernible change in its behavior. The robot's morphology must already contain the complexity in itself to allow enough \\"breathing room\\" for more internal processing to develop. Value principle: This was the architecture developed in the Darwin III robot of Gerald Edelman. It relies heavily on connectionism.  Critical responses = Traditionalist response to local environment claim  A traditionalist may argue that objects may be used to aid in cognitive processes, but this does not mean they are part of a cognitive system. Eyeglasses are used to aid in the visual process, but to say they are a part of a larger system would completely redefine what is meant by a visual system. However, supporters of the embodied approach could make the case that if objects in the environment play the functional role of mental states, then the items themselves should not be counted among the mental states.

He expanded the borders of the sultanate at the expense of his neighbors, particularly the Mengujek Beylik and the Ayyubids, and established a Seljuq presence on the Mediterranean with his acquisition of the port of Kalon Oros, later renamed Ala'iyya in his honor. The sultan, sometimes styled \\"Kayqubad the Great\\", is remembered today for his rich architectural legacy and the brilliant court culture that flourished under his reign. Kayqubad's reign represented the apogee of Seljuq power and influence in Anatolia, and Kayqubad himself was considered the most illustrious prince of the dynasty. In the period following the mid-13th century Mongol invasion, inhabitants of Anatolia frequently looked back on his reign as a golden age, while the new rulers of the Anatolian beyliks sought to justify their own authority through pedigrees traced to him. Biography The sultanate expanded considerably during the reign of Kayqubad, mostly in the east. Kayqubad was the second son of Sultan Kaykhusraw I, who bestowed upon him at an early age the title malik and the governorship of the important central Anatolian town of Tokat. When the sultan died following the battle of Ala≈üehir in 1211,Reford, p. 70. both Kayqubad and his elder brother Kaykaus struggled for the throne. Kayqubad initially garnered some allies among the neighbors of the sultanate: Leo I, the king of Cilician Armenia and Tughrilshah, the brothers' uncle and the independent ruler of Erzurum. Most of the emirs, as the powerful landed aristocracy of the sultanate, supported Kaykaus. Kayqubad was forced to flee to the fortress at Ankara, where he sought aid from the Turkman tribes of Kastamonu. He was soon apprehended and imprisoned by his brother in a fortress in western Anatolia.Cahen, Pre-Ottoman Turkey, pp. 120-1. Upon Kaykaus' unexpected death in 1219 (or 1220), Kayqubad, released from captivity, succeeded to the throne of the sultanate. The Kƒ±zƒ±l Kule, or Red Tower, built in Alanya by Kayqubad I. In 1227/1228, Kayqubad advanced into Anatolia, where the arrival of Jalal ad- Din Mingburnu, who was fleeing the destruction of his Khwarezmian Empire by the Mongols, had created an unstable political situation. The sultan settled Turcomans along the Taurus Mountains frontier, in a region later called ƒ∞√ßel. At the end of the 13th century, these Turcomans established the Karamanids. The sultan defeated the Artuqids and the Ayyubids and absorbed the Mengujek emirate into the sultanate, capturing the fortresses of Hƒ±sn Mansur, Kahta, and √áemi≈ügezek along his march. He also put down a revolt by the Empire of Trebizond and, although he fell short of capturing their capital, forced the Komnenos dynasty family to renew their pledges of vassalage. At first Kayqubad sought an alliance with his Turkish kinsman Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu against the Mongol threat. The alliance could not be achieved, and afterwards Jalal ad-Din took the important fortress at Ahlat. Kayqubad finally defeated him at the Battle of Yassƒ±√ßimen between Sivas and Erzincan in 1230. After his victory, he advanced further east, establishing Seljuq rule over Erzurum, Ahlat and the region of Lake Van (formerly part of Ayyubids). The Artuqids of Diyarbakƒ±r and the Ayyubids of Syria recognized his sovereignty. He also captured a number of fortresses in Georgia, whose queen sued for peace and gave her daughter Tamar in marriage to Kayqubad's son, Kaykhusraw II.Cahen, p. 130 Mindful of the increasing presence and power of the Mongols on the borders of the Sultanate of Rum, he strengthened the defenses and fortresses in his eastern provinces. He was given poison during a feast at Kayseri and died at an early age on 31 May 1237, the last of his line to die in independence. Historian Ibn Bibi mourned his death with these words,\\"With Kayqubad's death, the back of Islam was broken and the bond of kingdom and religion snapped\\". Yivli Minare Mosque, built in Antalya by Kayqubad I. Family Kayqubad had three sons: Kaykhusraw II, eldest and son of his Greek wife Mah Pari Khatun, and 'Rukn al- Din' and 'Izz al-Din', sons of his Ayyubid princess wife Adila Khatun.Cahen, p. 133 According to Ibn Bibi, Kayqubad wanted 'Rukn al-Din' as his successor who was elder one of his two sons from his Ayyubid wife, Malika Adila Khatun, but the emirs generally preferred to rally behind the more powerful Kaykhusraw. With no clear successor, conflict broke out between the various factions upon Kayqubad's death. Architectural and cultural legacy Kayqubad sponsored a large scale building campaign across Anatolia. Apart from reconstructing towns and fortresses, he built many mosques, medreses, caravanserais, bridges and hospitals, many of which are preserved to this day. Besides completing the construction of the Seljuq Palace in Konya, he also built the Kubadabad Palace on the shore of Lake Bey≈üehirThirteenth-Century Rum Seljuq Palaces and Palace Imagery, Scott Redford, Ars Orientalis, Vol. 23, Pre-Modern Islamic Palaces (1993), 220., Alanya Castle and Red Tower in Alanya and Kayqubadiyya Palace near Kayseri. Relations with Scholars Kayqubad I has good relations with the Muslim scholars, sufis and poets. He valued and protected them. Many Muslim sufis and poets such as M≈´hy≈´ddƒ´n ƒ∞bn≈´l-ArƒÅbƒ´, Abd al-La·π≠ƒ´f al-BaghdƒÅdƒ´, Ahi Evran, Necmeddƒ´n-i DƒÅyƒì, KƒÅni√Æ-i T≈´sƒ´, Shihab al-Din 'Umar al-Suhrawardi and Sultanul≈´lemƒÅ B√¢h√¢eddƒ´n Veled came to Anatolia during his reign and gained appreciation and respect from him.

He then spent four years doing The Charles Laquidara Radio Hour on WZLX. He currently hosts Charles Laquidara radio, an internet radio station from his home on Maui. Throughout his career in broadcasting, Laquidara has been known for playing a wide variety of musical styles alongside rock music, including classical, jazz, disco, soul and funk, and for being an outspoken critic of corporate governance and American right- wing politics.  Biography =Early career Born in Milford, Massachusetts, Laquidara attended Milford High School, where he was voted \\"most artistic\\" in his class. Upon graduation, he attended the Rhode Island School of Design for two years, and then in 1961 moved to Pasadena, California, where he received a bachelor's degree in theater arts at the Pasadena Playhouse. He spent the next eight years in the Los Angeles area, trying to get work as an actor in television and films. His successes in the acting field were limited to several stage roles and one appearance as a contestant on The Dating Game. He lost, but was awarded a tape recorder as a consolation prize. He was also considered for the lead in the film, The Boston Strangler, along with Alan Bates and Tony Curtis, but Curtis was ultimately awarded the lead role as Albert DeSalvo. Broadcasting career While seeking acting work, Laquidara worked part-time in the 1960s as a classical music announcer at KPPC-FM in Pasadena, California. After several moves back and forth to his home state of Massachusetts, he eventually ended up working at KPPC full-time. A columnist for the Pasadena Star-News called attention to Laquidara's unusual style in 1965. The writer described Laquidara as an aspiring actor doing radio in a then-radical way, including using long, dramatic pauses in his descriptions of the opera La boh√®me and often playing passages of music he admired two or more times in a row, both practices strongly discouraged by accepted radio hosting standards of the time. =California freeform= In October 1967, KPPC was purchased by the owner of San Francisco station KMPX. KPPC soon followed KMPX in adopting the new \\"Underground Radio\\" rock format known as \\"freeform\\". Laquidara's classical music background and interest in jazz also helped form the eclectic nature of the influential radio station. As described by former station manager Dave Pierce in a memoir, in the late sixties Laquidara typically began his midnight program with \\"twenty minutes of bird sounds\\" and then \\"juxtaposed The Blue Danube waltz and Emerson, Lake & Palmer.\\" =Return to Massachusetts= Laquidara has said he \\"quit radio in ‚Äô76 because it was getting in the way of my cocaine habit. When I came back in ‚Äô78, I didn‚Äôt want to come back, because I still wanted to continue being able to do cocaine. Luckily I‚Äôm still alive.\\" In 1969, he was offered an airshift at WBCN in Boston, to replace disc jockey Peter Wolf, who was leaving to join the newly formed J. Geils Band. In 1972, Laquidara took over the morning shift on WBCN ‚Äî dubbed the show \\"The Big Mattress\\" ‚Äî and stayed there for almost 25 years, before moving to WBCN sister station WZLX in 1996.As part of WBCN's 40th Birthday Celebration, Charles Laquidara dropped by for lunch with Adam 12, WBCN =The Big Mattress= The Big Mattress, Laquidara's morning program, was a pioneer effort in FM broadcasting. It was one of the first FM broadcasts to feature a shifting cast of on-air personnel, including producers, writers and production staff. The program included music, news, talk and humor such as making prank phone calls to unsuspecting listeners, elements that are now a widely used characteristic of \\"drive time\\" radio. One feature of the program was a segment called \\"Mishigas\\" (Yiddish for \\"craziness\\") where the group led by Laquidara would quiz listeners, including celebrities, offering prizes for correct responses. If the listener was unable to answer the quiz, a penalty of having to \\"dance the Funky Chicken\\" was issued. The Big Mattress was a top-rated Boston area radio show lasting for over twenty years. The program's name was retired in 1996 when Laquidara, who at that time was one of the most highly paid disc jockeys in the country, was persuaded to move to WZLX by Oedipus, WBCN's program director. Oedipus had risen to prominence during the punk and new wave era of the late seventies as one of Laquidara's unpaid writers. Now Laquidara's boss, Oedipus convinced him to move his show to sister station WZLX to make way for the more popular syndicated morning program of shock jock Howard Stern. The new program, called The Charles Laquidara Radio Hour, was broadcast from the Prudential Tower in Boston's Back Bay. =Duane Ingalls Glasscock= As a recurring part of WBCN's The Big Mattress, Laquidara introduced his alter ego, Duane Ingalls Glasscock, who Laquidara later described as \\"vile, sexist\\". Glasscock spoke with a thick Boston accent and was used by Laquidara to point out the hypocrisy of political correctness. Duane Glasscock initially used a vulgar catchphrase suggesting anal sexual assault. When he was told not to utter the phrase on the air any more, he \\"cleaned it up\\" into the similar-sounding \\"Have you even been phoned in Upton, Mass. for being a lucky wise guy?\\" Duane opened most of his broadcasts and segments with the phrase \\"Hello, Rangooooooon!\\", following a signature sound effect. Laquidara revealed in an interview that the Glasscock character, who hosted his \\"own\\" show on Saturday mornings at WBCN, actually received higher ratings than Laquidara's regular weekday broadcast. =Social activism= From the earliest period of KPPC freeform radio and continuing throughout his career, Laquidara has participated in social activism and promoted a strongly held liberal political stance. In his memoir of their years at KPPC entitled Riding on the Ether Express, Dave Pierce recalls a close friendship with Laquidara, who was an early vocal opponent of the Vietnam War. In December 1968, just prior to Laquidara's return to Massachusetts, Pierce and his wife and children went with Laquidara to Elysian Park in Los Angeles for a fund raising gathering they had helped promote on the radio for the Free Clinic, a local charity. The event, which was at that time a frequent counterculture form of activism, attracted 5,000 people, many of whom openly smoked marijuana. However, without warning or announced intentions, shortly after the event began several dozen carloads of Los Angeles riot police appeared and proceeded to forcibly remove the crowd from the park. After escaping a full- scale assault from the police with the Pierces, Laquidara headed immediately to KPPC and delivered a scathing ten-minute on-air diatribe against the LAPD. Laquidara continued his sometimes controversial political activism while on- air at WBCN in Boston. Following a commercial for a camera store, he denounced Honeywell corporation anti-personnel munitions, which brought on a lawsuit from the advertiser that sold Honeywell cameras. His alter ego, Duane Glasscock, was fired for telling listeners to send \\"a bag of shit to the Arbitron research bureau\\". Arbitron is a corporation that provides the radio industry with market research and listener counts, and Laquidara used Duane to question the integrity of the powerful company. He drew national attention in 1988 for leading anti-Apartheid protests and a boycott of Shell Oil.Charles Laquidara boycotts Shell Oil, WGBH, The Ten O'Clock News,1988-08-23 =Retirement to Maui= Laquidara finally achieved movie acting credit in 1998, playing a small part as one of the \\"phone dates\\" in the film Next Stop Wonderland, which was shot in and around Boston. After his retirement in August 2000, Laquidara moved to Hawaii. In 2005, Laquidara sold his home in upcountry Maui for over US$2 million to Oprah Winfrey, whose magazine referred to it as a \\"fixer-upper\\". In another real estate deal, two years later he sold a sprawling estate in Haiku, Hawaii that he had purchased for $1.75 million to spiritual leader Baba Ram Dass for $2.3 million. During the first half of 2006, Laquidara broadcast a show from his home in Hawaii that aired on Boston radio station 92.9 WBOS called \\"Backspin\\". The show was short-lived, however. Laquidara resigned shortly after being chastised for playing Neil Young's song \\"Let's Impeach the President\\" during the height of the Iraq War. In 2009, Laquidara returned to Boston to mark the closing of his original station, WBCN, doing a series of interviews and hosting an exclusive tribute party at a local nightclub to which only station employees and former employees were invited. While in Boston, Laquidara was inducted as a member of the Massachusetts Broadcasters Hall of Fame in recognition of his pioneering efforts in FM radio. Present day Laquidara occasionally prepares shows for internet broadcast via Mana'o Radio KEAO-LP in Wailuku, Hawaii. He has held this position since March 2005. Laquidara now permanently resides in Kihei, Hawaii on Maui. He hosts Charles Laquidara Radio, an internet radio station that plays a variety of rock, nu-wave, and classic hits peppered with comedy bits, song parodies and Mishegas segments from \\"The Big Mattress.\\" He was featured in a 2015 documentary about Radio DJs called I Am What I Play, directed by Roger King.Seventh Art Releasing, I Am What I Play.

He was born in Tillaiyadi in Thanjavur District in Tamil Nadu. The three Tamil composers Arunachala Kavi, Muthu Thandavar and Marimutthu Pillai are considered the Tamil Trinity,Tamil Music, Carnatica.net who contributed to the evolution of Carnatic music. His father died when he was 12, and during that time he went to Dharmapuram Mutt to continue his studies in Sanskrit and Tamil. The head of Mutt was so pleased with him he even considered making Arunchala his successor. At 18, he left Mutt and continued his studies in Tamil for another 12 years. He got married at the age of 30 in a place called Karuppur and earned his livelihood by setting up a jeweller's shop. He wanted to buy gold at a cheaper rate, therefore he travelled to Pondicherry. On his way, he stopped at Seerkazhi, and found a branch of Dharmapuram Mutt. The head was his old colleague, Chidambaram. Chidamabaram convinced him to do a Prabandham, then convinced him and his family to settle in Seerkaazhi. Therefore, he got the name Seerkaazhi AruNaachala Kavi. He then wanted to do an arangettram in a temple, but the temple priests denied him permission unless the Lord himself gave it. So during the night, Lord Ranganaatha appeared and let him do it. Thus came it about that AruNaachala Kaviraayar's Raama Naatakam, composed in a series of lyrics, drew wide attention. The lyrics set in Carnaatic raagaas have become immensely popular. AruNaachala Kaviraayar died in 1779 68. (info from arichana theory notes) Compositions Arunachala Kavi was fluent in Tamil, Telugu and Sanskrit. He wrote Rama Natakam, a musical drama based on the Ramayana. The music for this musical was composed by two of Arunachala Kavi's disciples, Kothandarama Iyer and Venkatarama Iyer. The songs contain many Tamil proverbs and sayings. This musical drama was first performed at the Srirangam temple and within a short time it became very popular. Kavirayar was honoured by Maharaja Tulaja, the King of Tanjavur, and by several other patrons of that time. He also composed Seergazhi Sthala Puranam (sirkali), Seergazhi Kovai, Hanumar Pillai Tamil, Ajomukhi Natakam and a few Keertanas. Some of his famous compositions still popular today are Enpalli kondir iyya, Yaro ivar yaro (Bhairavi), Kanden Kanden Sitayai (Vasanta), Ramanai Kannara Kandane (Mohanam).

She was created by American mystery author Stuart Palmer (1905‚Äì1968). Character Miss Withers \\"whom the census enumerator had recently listed as 'spinster, born Boston, age thirty-nine, occupation school teacher'\\" becomes an amateur sleuth in the first book of the series. Her adventures are usually comic but are nevertheless straightforward mysteries. She is a partial variation on Agatha Christie's Miss Marple. \\"A lean, angular spinster lady, her unusual hats and the black cotton umbrella she carries are her trademark. ... Hildegarde collects tropical fish, abhors alcohol and tobacco, and appears to have an irritable disposition. However, she is a romantic at heart and will extend herself to help young lovers.\\"Penzler, Otto, et al. Detectionary. Woodstock, New York: Overlook Press, 1977. She collaborates, and frequently butts heads, with Inspector Oscar Piper, a high-ranking homicide detective in the New York Police Department. Edna May Oliver starred in the first three screen adaptations, produced by RKO Radio Pictures, and is considered by fans of the film series the definitive Miss Withers. When Oliver left RKO in 1935 to sign with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, RKO attempted to continue the series with Helen Broderick and then ZaSu Pitts, but Oliver's presence was sorely missed and the films were poorly received. Author Palmer approved of Oliver's characterization so much that he gave the actress a mention in his Hollywood- based Withers novel The Puzzle of the Happy Hooligan. Stuart Palmer collaborated with fellow mystery writer Craig Rice on several short stories that teamed Hildegarde Withers with Rice's lawyer-sleuth John J. Malone. This collaboration led to a Hollywood film, but due to contractual problems, Withers' character wound up being omitted from the movie. She was replaced by a feisty widow known as \\"Mrs. O'Malley\\". The film, a comic mystery released in 1950 as Mrs. O'Malley and Mr. Malone, starred James Whitmore and Marjorie Main as the title characters. In 1972, CBS made a Withers television movie with Eve Arden as Withers and James Gregory as Piper. The movie was well-received but there weren't any sequels.

He was appointed a Member of the Order of Saint John.  Life St George on Horseback, St. John's Co-Cathedral, Valletta Born in the small town of Taverna in Calabria, Preti was called Il Cavalier Calabrese (the Calabrian Knight) after appointment as a Knight of the Order of St. John (Knights of Malta) in 1660.John T. Spike, Mattia Preti: I Documenti, Florence: 1999. His early apprenticeship is said to have been with the \\"Caravaggist\\" Giovanni Battista Caracciolo, which may account for his lifelong interest in the style of Caravaggio. Probably before 1630, Preti joined his brother Gregorio (also a painter), in Rome, where he became familiar with the techniques of Caravaggio and his school as well as with the work of Guercino, Rubens, Guido Reni, and Giovanni Lanfranco. In Rome, he painted fresco cycles in the churches of Sant'Andrea della Valle and San Carlo ai Catinari. Between 1644 and 1646, he may have spent time in Venice,Wittkower, 360 but remained based in Rome until 1653, returning later in 1660‚Äì61. He painted frescoes for the church of San Biagio at Modena (app. 1651‚Äì2) and participated in the fresco decoration of the Palazzo Pamphilj in Valmontone (documented 1660‚Äì61), where he worked along with Pier Francesco Mola, Gaspar Dughet, Francesco Cozza, Giovanni Battista Tassi (il Cortonese), and Guglielmo Cortese. During most of 1653‚Äì1660, he worked in Naples, where he was influenced by another prominent painter of his era, Luca Giordano. Preti's major works include a series of large frescoes, ex-votos depicting the Virgin or saints delivering people from the plague, which were painted on seven city gates and are now lost. Two sketches are in the Capodimonte Museum in Naples.James Clifton, \\"Mattia Preti's Frescoes for the City Gates of Naples,\\" Art Bulletin (1994), 479‚Äì501 The bozzetto of the Virgin with the baby Jesus looming over the dying and their burial parties envisions a Last Judgement presided over by a woman.Clifton, 480. Preti's salary for the work was 1500 ducats. Preti also won a commission to supervise the construction, carving, and gilding for the nave and transept of San Pietro a Maiella. Having been made a Knight of Grace in the Order of St John, he visited the order's headquarters in Malta in 1659 and spent most of the remainder of his life there. Preti transformed the interior of St. John's Co-Cathedral in Valletta with a huge series of paintings on the life and martyrdom of St. John the Baptist (1661‚Äì1666). In Malta one also can find many paintings of Preti in private collections and in parish churches. His increased reputation led to an expanded circle of patrons, and he received commissions from all over Europe.Bonello, Giovanni (2000). Art in Malta ‚Äì Discoveries and Recoveries .

Opera Software also implemented the Nintendo DS Browser for Nintendo's handheld system. Internet Channel uses an internet connection (set in the Wii Settings) to retrieve pages directly from a web site's HTTP or HTTPS server, not through a network of proxy servers as in Opera Mini products. Internet Channel is capable of rendering most web sites in the same manner as its desktop counterpart by using Opera's Medium Screen Rendering technology. History On May 10, 2006, the Opera Software company announced plans to develop a web browser for the Wii. Trial version A trial version of the Internet Channel was released in December 2006, and a full version followed in April 2007. While in the beta stages of the development, this version of the Opera web browser implements some of the most widely reported features of the prospective final version. For example, it is possible to zoom in on web pages (by one increment) with the \\"+\\" button on the Wii Remote and pan around by holding the \\"B\\" button, and both Flash and AJAX functions are present. In addition, an alternative single-column rendering mode with large-print text can be toggled by pressing the \\"2\\" button on the Wii Remote, similar to the Small Screen Rendering mode seen on Opera's Nintendo DS Browser. Similar to other web browsers, the trial version has a \\"Favorites\\" system to allow users to bookmark sites. The Favorites page can be accessed either by pressing the '1' button on the Wii Remote or the on-screen button which has a star symbol. Favorites can be added, deleted and edited from the Favorites page. The browser displays a thumbnail image of each bookmarked site. The functionality of the trial version was limited in some respects. Web addresses could only be entered on the home page and there was no browsing history (only the basic back/forward system for accessing previous pages). The browser had a difficult time handling hyperlinks that would normally open a new window via JavaScript. There were no user-configurable settings such as custom home pages (the browser has a default splash page), preferences for cookies, or parental control features (although the Internet Channel can be locked out entirely via parental control configured from the Wii Menu), and there was no way to hide or \\"auto-hide\\" the navigation bar. Also, the total number of favorites a user could save was limited to 21 URLs. Release version The full version of the Internet Channel was released in April 2007. It was available as a free upgrade to owners of the trial version, but if the trial version had not been previously downloaded, Nintendo charged 500 Wii Points on July 1, 2007 to September 1, 2009. Before the release of Opera 9.5, the Internet Channel's layout engine was actually more advanced than Opera for desktops, as it included bug fixes that were not available in the desktop edition prior to version 9.5. USB Keyboard support added USB Keyboard support was added in an Internet Channel update on October 10, 2007. In addition launch time was reduced, increased the number of favorites to be saved to 56 and gave the ability to send Favorites to people in the Wii's Address Book. It added the ability to highlight words on a Web page and copy it to the \\"Search\\" function and the ability to type longer messages without the virtual keyboard lagging. The pricing remained the same as the release version. 500 Wii Points to initially download, free to update any previous version. Flash Lite implementation On September 1, 2009, the Internet Channel was updated and made available for free. Users who downloaded it when it cost 500 Wii Points were compensated with a free Nintendo Entertainment System game download of their choice from the Virtual Console, worth 500 Wii Points, between October 1 and December 31, 2009. In addition, it updated Flash Player to Adobe Flash Lite 3.1, which corresponds to a full implementation of Adobe Flash version 8 with certain features of Flash 9.Note: The Wii Browser now identifies itself as \\"AFL 9,1,122,0\\" to Flash applications as can be seen by visiting http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/155/tn_15507.html in the Wii Browser. Features The Opera-based Wii browser allows users full access to the Web and supports all the same web standards that are included in the desktop versions of Opera, including CSS and JavaScript. Like Opera 9, the Internet Channel fully passes the Acid2 web browser test. It is also possible for the browser to use technologies such as Ajax, RSS, and Adobe Flash. Opera Software has indicated that the functionality will allow for third parties to create web applications specifically designed for the use on the Wii Browser. The company has also stated that some Wii video games may implement the use of the browser. Opera Software designed the Wii browser to suit a \\"living room environment\\"; in contrast to the appearance of the Opera web browser on computer monitors, fonts are larger and the interface is simplified for easier use, similar to the style employed for MSN TV. Currently the user can zoom in on a detail on a web page, with animated transitions. Users are also able to insert a USB keyboard into the Wii system for text input. This functionality was added in a Wii system update and Internet Channel update (downloaded from the Wii Shop Channel) on October 10, 2007. As the browser supports Flash, users have the ability to interact with Flash-based software using the Wii Remote. As a result, several websites have been created or expanded to gather Wii-friendly Internet games. Windows Media Player and Real Video content at this point are incompatible with the Internet Channel. The Internet Channel also supports Wii Remote button shortcuts that allows access to Favorites, Refresh, Back, Forward, Stop, Search, and Enter web page. The shortcuts are: Favourites: B+down, Search: B+left, WWW: B+right, Refresh: B+up, Back: B+minus, Forward(but not Fast Forward): B+plus. Third-party web applications Third party APIs and SDKs have been released that allow developers to read the values of the Wii Remote buttons in both Flash and JavaScript. This allows for software that previously required keyboard controls to be converted for use with the Wii Remote. On May 8, 2007, Google created a version of Google Reader specifically formatted for the Internet Channel.Google Reader ‚Äì Google. Google.com (2013-07-15). Retrieved on 2013-08-23. The browser was also used to stream BBC iPlayer videos from April 9, 2008 after an exclusive deal was made with Nintendo UK and the BBC to offer their catch-up service for the Wii. However, the September 2009 update caused the iPlayer to no longer operate. The BBC acknowledged the issue and created a dedicated channel instead. In June 2009, YouTube released YouTube XL, a TV- friendly version of the popular video-sharing website. The regular YouTube page would redirect the browser to YouTube XL, if the website detects that the Internet Channel or the PlayStation 3 browser is being used. In June 2013, YouTube shut down YouTube XL.

Irvington Pl. between Bannock St. and Acoma St. Baker is a neighborhood in Denver, Colorado, United States. Geography Baker is generally defined by these boundaries: on the north by West 6th Avenue, on the east by Broadway, on the south by West Mississippi Avenue, and on the west by the South Platte River. Historic district A historic district of approximately 30 blocks lies in the northeast corner of the neighborhood with irregular borders that range from within a half block of Alameda Ave. and Broadway on the south and east to as far as Fox St. on the west and W. 5th Ave. on the north. The historic district designation was granted in 2000 as Baker Historic District as part of the Historic Preservation effort of the City of Denver. Criteria for designation included historical figures who lived in the neighborhood and many popular architectural styles, with several buildings designed by prominent architects, from a period of significance of 1873 to 1937. With small exceptions, the same area designated as a local historic district had been entered into the National Register of Historic Places as South Side‚ÄìBaker Historic District in 1985. South Side is a name used in the 1880s for a larger area from Cherry Creek to Yale Ave., mostly east of Broadway. In addition to the historic district, three individually- designated Denver Historic Landmark buildings are within Baker's boundaries: the Coyle/Chase House at 532 W. 4th Ave., home of playwright Mary Chase, the 1st and Broadway Building at 101-115 N. Broadway, and Fire Station No. 11 at 40 W. 2nd Ave. History A portion of the neighborhood's riverfront was homesteaded by William and Elizabeth Byers in 1859, just north of where James Beckwourth, a former slave, settled the same year. The first subdivision in Baker was platted along Santa Fe Dr. south of W. Sixth Ave. in 1872, and residential development took off in the 1880s. The part of the neighborhood north of Alameda Ave. was annexed into the city of Denver in 1883. The neighborhood includes hundreds of 19th century brick houses and 39 buildings by locally famous architect William Lang. More than 80 percent of the neighborhood was developed by 1900. In the 1970s the City of Denver named the neighborhood after Baker Junior High School (now Denver Center for International Studies) which had been named for turn of the 20th century University of Colorado president James Hutchins Baker, who never lived in the neighborhood. Character As of the 2010 Census Baker had 4879 residents from a variety of racial, ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. 15.3% of Baker residents were under 18 years old. The makeup of the neighborhood was 34.11% Latino, 58.50% non-Latino White, 2.95% African American, 0.88% Native American, 1.07% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 2.50% people of other or mixed racial background. The neighborhood has changed significantly since the 2000 Census, when the two most populous racial/ethnic groups were roughly reversed in proportion, with approximately 54% Latino and 40% non-Latino White. Overall population declined over the decade by 931 people, or 16.02%. The neighborhood is a mix of industrial, residential and commercial properties with the area along I-25 having an industrial character, the area along Broadway consisting mostly of commercial retail and offices, and north of Alameda between Santa Fe and Broadway making up the residential core. South of Alameda Ave. at Broadway is a large retail center with several big box stores and further south is the former Gates Rubber factory complex, site of a major redevelopment project which stalled in the late 2000s. Phil Milstein Park is the largest park within Baker, at . It occupies the extreme northwest corner of Baker and is only accessible from outside the neighborhood.http://bakernow.com/photos/bakers- biggest-park-dailey-or-milstein Within Baker's residential area are Dailey Park, at W. Ellsworth Ave. and S. Cherokee St. (), and Hector M. Flores Park, at W. 4th Ave. and N. Galapago St. (). Vanderbilt Park East () is not yet developed, but is a designated park property within the Broadway Station redevelopment. Baker is served by several bus lines and two Light Rail stops, Alameda and I-25 and Broadway.

It is notable as the first enclosed shopping mall in the United States and has been lauded as a fine example of commercial Greek Revival architecture. It served as a shopping center for many years before falling into decline in the late 20th century. It has since been closed for renovation and rehabilitation several times, and most recently reopened its doors in October 2013 as a residential and commercial mixed-use building. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. History The Arcade was developed as a commercial business venture by Cyrus Butler. Its preliminary design called for two floors of shops, and a third floor was added to the plans before construction began. The building was designed by Russell Warren and Tallman & Bucklin. Their design called for an arcaded lane of shops with skylights in the roof providing illumination, in emulation of similar structures then found in some European cities. Construction of the mall roughly followed the original plan, but some hasty alterations were made to meet the need for a vestibule and stairway on the Weybosset Street side of the building to provide access to the third floor. These were not well-constructed and required repairs in the 1940s. At the time of the Arcade's opening, there were few retail stores on the west side of the Providence River. Most shopping was located on the east side or Cheapside district. The arcade was slow to attract customers and was known as \\"Butler's Folly\\" for many years because of its distance from the retail districts. This changed when a fashionable hat shop opened next door which attracted wealthy female customers to the neighborhood. After that, Westminster Street and downtown developed into a major shopping area. In June 1843, President John Tyler toured New England while considering a potential third-party bid for re-election. One of Tyler's several Providence stops was at the Westminster Arcade, where he reportedly shook hands with 5,000 people. The building served as a shopping center well into the 20th century. It fell into disrepair but was rehabilitated by architects Irving B. Haynes & Associates and Gilbane Properties, and it reopened in 1980. It closed again in 2008 for renovations. It reopened in October 2013 as a mixed-use commercial and residential \\"micro-loft\\" space under real estate developer Evan Granoff of Granoff Associates LLC working with Northeast Collaborative Architects. The Arcade was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. and Description The Arcade is a long, narrow building extending between Westminster and Weybosset Streets, north of Orange Street in downtown Providence. The two street-facing sides consist of Greek temple fronts, with six massive Ionic columns high. The columns on the Westminster Street side are topped by a triangular pediment; the Weybosset Street side has a block-and-panel railing above a simple entablature. Behind these fronts are open vestibule areas with stairs leading to the upper levels. The stairs leading to the third level are somewhat crowded beneath the roofline, particularly on the Weybosset Street side, where the vestibule was a late addition occasioned by the decision to add a third floor. The long sides of the building are relatively unadorned, as it was expected by the architects that structures would eventually be built abutting them. The interior consists of a main avenue on the ground floor, above which the second and third floor lanes are protected by richly decorated cast iron railings capped in mahogany. The skylit roof extends the length of the building, its ridgeline aligned at the Westminster end with the top of the triangular pediment. Emphasis in all of the building's construction was on the use of fireproof materials; granite, brick, and cast iron are all used, and the roof was made of tin.

Andrew Lang included it in The Grey Fairy Book (1900). Synopsis A man left his seven daughters with instructions not to leave the house, because they had provisions for three years. One day, the third year, the oldest suggested that they leave; the youngest tried to dissuade them, and all her sisters attacked her. They left the door open when they returned, and a witch got in and ate all the sisters, except the youngest, who ran away. She hid in an ogre's castle. He returned and persuaded her to come out; because she was young, he took her as his daughter and had her look after the house for him, keeping six of the keys, but reserving the seventh for himself. One day, she asked for the key; when he refused it, she stole it. He learned this when he woke, but decided not to wake her to take it back. She opened the door and saw an ox, drawing up water to water a garden. It claimed the ogre was feeding her up to eat her. She cried. The ogre told her what to tell the ox, and she did, making it fall to the earth for seven days and nights. The prince, whose garden it was, came and found it withered. The ox begged for mercy and told of the girl. He hid and watched when she came to the garden again. The prince, being taken by her beauty, invited the ogre to dinner and asked about the girl. The ogre agreed to their marriage, but when he came to take the bride, the ogre forbade her to speak to him unless he swore \\"by the head of Buk Ettemsuch.\\" The prince, annoyed at her muteness, took another bride. The girl worked magic in the kitchen, putting her fingers into boiling oil to make them fried fish, and jumping in the fire to become a fresh loaf. The bride said she could do that as well, jumped in the fire, and burned to death. The prince took yet another bride. The girl sat down on a stake to spin, and the bride ordered her off because she could do that as well, and impaled herself on the stake. The prince spied on the girl. She went a pitcher and a water jug to fetch her water. The water-jug broke the pitcher, the pitcher asked her to beat it, and the water-jug begged her not to \\"by the head of Buk Ettemsuch.\\" She said if only her husband had said that, she could speak to him. He jumped up and told her to speak to him \\"by the head of Buk Ettemsuch.\\" They lived happily after.

He received his country's highest military decoration‚Äîthe Medal of Honor‚Äîfor actions in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Born in Iowa, he joined the Navy in 1894 and participated in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, the largest naval engagement of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Deignan and seven others attempted to block the entrance to Santiago Harbor, Cuba but the Spanish destroyed their ship before they could accomplish their mission, and took them prisoner. The men were later released and Deignan received the Medal of Honor for his actions. He went on to become an officer and served in various posts and ships throughout the Navy until retiring in 1906. He died in Colorado in 1916, and was buried in California. Early life Deignan was born February 24, 1873 (as per first Navy enlistment record dated December 7, 1894) near Stuart, Iowa to John Deignan and his wife. His father had also been a sailor, serving in the Navy during the American Civil War, and afterwards went to work for the Rock Island Railway as a conductor. When Osborn was five years old, a tornado struck his father's train in Grinnel, Iowa, killing him and leaving Osborn, his mother and his brother to survive on their own. His mother remarried and the family, along with two additional children from his new stepfather, moved to North Tremont Street in Stuart. In 1887 he left school and went to sea, serving on ships in the Atlantic, the Arctic and the Caribbean. Military career Deignan enlisted in the United States Navy from his home state of Iowa, originally on December 7, 1894 (as per first Navy enlistment record). He served on numerous USN vessels between 1894 and 1896 and, having deserted from the USS Newark on May 6, 1896 (as per naval records maintained by the Military Record Center) then re-enlistment in 1898 (as per naval records maintained by the Military Record Center.) He was assigned as a Coxswain to the during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The Merrimac had frequent problems with the steering and engines, and Deignan referred to it as \\"cranky\\". After a short time on the ship, he garnered a reputation as an able helmsman and was preferred when delivering coal to the other ships in the fleet, a task that could be difficult in a ship that was already hard to control. When Rear Admiral William T. Sampson requested volunteers for an extremely dangerous mission, there were more than enough volunteers, but he chose Osborn as the helmsman. The mission was to sink Merrimac at the entrance to Santiago Harbor, Cuba in an effort to block it and pen the Spanish Navy in the harbor. Seven other members of the crew were also chosen for the assignment. While the crew was attempting to fulfill its mission, Spanish forces fired on the ship and, in the process, disabled the Merrimacs steering controls before the crew could complete their task. The ship sank without obstructing navigation, but the crew was able to escape the ship before she went under. They were rescued by the Spanish and were taken as prisoners-of-war. A month later the Spanish fleet was destroyed at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba and the crewman were released. For his \\"extraordinary heroism\\" during the operation, Deignan was awarded the Medal of Honor. On April 9, 1900, Deignan was promoted to the Warrant Officer rank of Boatswain. As an officer, his initial assignments were in the Philippines, first at Manila, then at the Naval Station, Cavite. After meeting her at a party in 1898, he married Maud Huntoon on May 14, 1902 and together they had a daughter. In June 1902, he reported for duty on the and later that year transferred to the receiving ship , at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, California. He was stationed at Navy Yard, Pensacola, Florida from 1903‚Äì04, and then was assigned to the receiving ship , at Norfolk, Virginia. He remained there for less than a year before reporting for his last tour of duty on the monitor in April 1905. He retired on April 21, 1906 and moved to the Los Angeles area. Death and legacy Deignan died April 16, 1916 in Ca√±on City at the age of 43 (based on birth in 1873) and was buried with full military honors at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, California. His grave can be found in the Whispering Pines section, L-1165. Post #1842 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars was named in his honor. Medal of Honor citation Rank and organization: Coxswain, U.S. Navy.

It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19618. Lyrics Common modern versions include: :Little Tommy Tucker ::Sings for his supper. :What shall we give him? ::White bread and butter. :How shall he cut it ::Without a knife? :How will he be married ::Without a wife?I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 416‚Äì7. Origins According to Peter and Iona Opie, the earliest version of this rhyme appeared in Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book (c. 1744), which recorded only the first four lines. The full version was included in Mother Goose's Melody (c. 1765). To 'sing for one's supper' was a proverbial phrase by the seventeenth century.William George Smith, The Oxford Dictionary Of English Proverbs, 1949, p.323. Early in that century, too, possible evidence of the rhyme's prior existence is suggested by the appearance of the line \\"Tom would eat meat but wants a knife\\" in An excellent new Medley (c. 1620), a composite work in which each line incorporates a reference to a contemporary song.Text on the University of Michigan site Another possible reference occurs in Robert Herrick's epigram ‚ÄúUpon Tuck‚Äù that appears in Hesperides (1648): ::At post and pair, or slam, Tom Tuck would play ::This Christmas, but his want wherewith says nay. The reference in the first line here is to stakes or forfeits in contemporary games of cards.Luminarium Once the rhyme entered the nursery repertoire it was frequently included in collections of such lore and tunes were then fitted to it. The Library of Congress preserves an 1885 round for four voices by the Canadian Sydney Percival (musical pseudonym of Joseph Gould) in which Tommy is \\"singing for his supper. What shall he have but white bread and butter? How shall he cut it without any knife, How shall he marry without any wife?\\"Library of Congress, \\"Little Tommy Tucker\\" In 1924 the English composer Peter Warlock set it as the fifth piece in his Candlelight: a cycle of nursery jingles.Lieder NetA performance on YouTube The rhyme was also included in Carl Orff and Gunild Keetman‚Äôs children's musical education project, Schulwek (1950).A performance on YouTube NotesExternal links English children's songs English folk songs Traditional children's songs Songs about fictional male characters English nursery rhymes Roud Folk Song Index songs Year of song unknown Songwriter unknown ","title":"Little Tommy Tucker"},{"id":"6339149","text":"Shanghai University of Technology (SUT ‰∏äÊµ∑Â∑•‰∏öÂ§ßÂ≠¶) was a leading public university in Shanghai, China.

It is produced by allowing unpasteurized milk to turn sour (ferment) at a specific humidity and temperature. Over time, the milk thickens or curdles into a yogurt-like substance with a strong, sour flavor. In rural areas of the Southern United States, it was commonly eaten for breakfast with brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, or molasses added. Some people also eat it with fruit or black pepper and cream. Prior to the now- popular use of baking powder, clabber was used as a quick leavener in baking. Due to its stability, clabbered milk has been popular in areas without access to steady refrigeration. History Clabber was brought to the South by the Ulster Scots who settled in the Appalachian Mountains. Clabber is still sometimes referred to as bonny clabber (originally \\"bainne cl√°bair\\", from Gaelic bainne‚Äîmilk, and cl√°bair‚Äîsour milk or milk of the churndash). Clabber passed into Scots and Hiberno-English dialects meaning wet, gooey mud, though it is commonly used now in the noun form to refer to the food or in the verb form \\"to curdle\\". Clabber was sometimes served with a specialized spoon. This is a serving utensil formed with the handle made at a 90 degree angle from the spoon bowl, to accommodate the manner in which clabber had to be ladled out of the container in which it formed. With the rise of pasteurization the making of clabber virtually stopped, except on farms where there was an easy access to unprocessed cow's milk. A somewhat similar food can be made from pasteurized milk by adding a couple of tablespoons of commercial buttermilk or sour milk to a glass of milk. Similar foods Similar foods are the South African amasi, German Dickmilch (thick milk), Scandinavian filmj√∂lk, and Russian prostokvasha , Lithuanian \\"r≈´gpienis\\" , Latvian r≈´gu≈°piens and Hungarian \\"aludttej\\".

With Master P, the film stars Silkk the Shocker, Gary Busey, Jeff Speakman, Clifton Powell, Dick Anthony Williams, Shrieen Crutchfield, Anthony Boswell, Mia X, Snoop Dogg, C-Murder and Mystikal. This film started a brief rivalry between No Limit Records and Cash Money Records as the name \\"Hot Boyz\\" was already the name of the popular rap group, which consisted of: Lil Wayne, Juvenile, Turk, and B.G.  Synopsis  Kool (Silkk The Shocker) is a good kid from the inner city with ambitions of becoming a successful rap star. He is a black belt in Kenpo karate and is in love with poised and college-bound LaShawna (Shireen Crutchfield). Plot The movie starts with Kool jumping out of a two-story window running towards his red Chevrolet Corvette only to be given chase by the Los Angeles Police Department. He seems to have escaped pursuit until they tail him again and the car hightails into a river. Kool starts to narrate his story, telling the audience \\"I'm not surprised this road is ending, I've been on this road to nowhere for a while. My name is Kool, they say I'm a thug...I say I was made into one.\\" as the movie flashes back 6 months earlier. Kool, C-Dawg (Snoop Dogg), Pee Wee (Anthony Johnson), and Remo (C-Murder) are all seen playing a card game at a neighborhood barbecue. Kool impresses his friends at the table by free-styling while playing cards. The movie then introduces LaShawna and Mrs. Ferrel (Pamella D'Pella) as LaShawna asks if Kool has gotten to the barbecue. Mrs. Ferrel shuns him off, not liking the company he keeps around him. Kool and LaShawna try to persuade Mrs. Ferrel to let LaShawna go to Las Vegas with Kool (as LaShawna will be leaving for college soon, and they won't be seeing each other on a permanent basis anymore) to which Mrs. Ferrel declines. She tells Kool to take her daughter to the museum since she said Kool was an \\"artist.\\" The movie then skips ahead to Kool sparring with other students in a Kenpo-karate class which introduces Master Keaton (Jeff Speakman) as his mentor. Kool has made his transition from a brown belt to a black belt. The movie then skips to the next day and introduces Tyrel (Mystikal), and he is arguing with C-Dawg about Mike Tyson biting Holyfield's ear off in the boxing match. Kool changes the subject and turns on a song that he wrote in which his friends do not give him credit. LaShawna comes by and they go over to Kool's house. LaShawna remembers his birthday and has a cake she baked for him. The movie cuts to an office at the LAPD precinct. Officer Mack (Brent Huff) is interrupted from his work by Maurice (Maurice Lamont) and Mack tries to tell him that the deal is off due to there being an undercover cop on the deal. Maurice tells Mack that the deal is still on and that he'd better be there. The movie jumps back to Kool and LaShawna in bed together with Kool telling LaShawna that he had written her a song that was going to get them out of the hood and into a better place. They are interrupted by Tyrel knocking on the door telling Kool to hurry up because something big is about to go down, and C-Dawg and Remo are in the middle of it. LaShawna hears Tyrel screaming at the door and she gives Kool the go ahead despite Kool not wanting her to walk home by herself. As she is walking home, she witnesses a stabbing and discovers the victim is a cop as he dies in her arms. As the officer dies Officer Mack, who is a dirty cop, brandishes his gun, which causes LaShawna to run away from the crime scene just as help is arriving, and LaShawna runs all the way home where she is apprehended and taken into custody. Kool arrives and Eddy (Anthony Boswell) explains that she has just been charged with murder despite he and Kool knowing that she would never kill anyone. Eddy reluctantly offers to help, but can't due to the fact that it isn't his murder case. Kool wants to prove her innocence, and Tully (Gary Busey), the cynical detective in charge, ignores LaShawna's case but uses Kool to break up an incipient crime operation, which has Saint (Clifton Powell) jailed and LaShawna's certain release. She's in danger because the guilty parties fear that the officer talked before he died. While in jail, pregnant with Kool's child and awaiting a hearing and legal help, she's beaten to death by Mack. While at LaShawna's funeral, Officer Mack pulls out an Uzi and fires upon the funeral. Kool gets into a hearse and gives chase to Mack, Kool eventually catches up to Mack and destroys the van he is driving, killing him. After being double crossed by a crooked cop and having his girlfriend wrongfully accused of murder and jailed, he begins to find difficulty in ignoring the lure of urban gang-life, and Kool vows revenge. Kool is eventually pushed over the edge by a pair of racist cops and decides to start his own gang called \\"Hot Boyz,\\" who turn out to be the toughest new gang in the city. As the Hot Boyz continue their rise to dominance, they are all at a club when Tyrel comes and sits at the bar with them, and tells them that Saint gets released from prison at 9 o'clock in the morning. Tyrel and Remo insist that they kill him before he puts together another crew and there will be a turf war between Saint and the Hot Boyz. Moe (Master P) is an informant who is helping out Officer Roberts (C. Thomas Howell) with the case at hand, Moe tells Roberts exactly what he wants to know and Moe skips town after it happens. Pee Wee makes a deal with Saint, who lets him in his organization when he told about the hit the Hot Boyz were planning on him. C-Dawg finds out what Pee Wee did, then he and Kool confront him about it. Kool scolds him, then reaches into his pocket, and Pee Wee, thinking Kool is about to kill him, runs for his own safety and is shot and killed by C-Dawg. Kool reveals that he was never intending to kill Pee Wee, but just send him back to his hometown of Oakland with a plane ticket. Saint finds the warehouse where the Hot Boyz do their business and has his crew, and the corrupt police working with them, draw their guns and get ready to kill. A 10-minute gunfight ensues, in which most of the Hot Boyz, Saints Crew and the Police Force are killed or injured. Kool and Tully have a standoff in which Kool wins due to C-Dawg (who was shot by Saint earlier in the shootout) regaining consciousness and assisting Kool in a move which costs him his own life, Kool kills Tully and in the end as he jumps out of the window, hops into a car and jumps into the river, he tells the audience that \\"There was time when the world was mine; LaShawna, me, and our baby, the future looked so good, and now I'm on a dead impact and a crash course with destiny.\\" He also tells the audience that it's funny when you're thirty-eight feet below, all the guns, and the money in the world doesn't even matter any more, and that you find yourself thinking about the strangest things,noting \\"I found myself thinking about justice, and that I realized I had not found any for myself, I had just been sinking deeper and deeper, and that now all I wonder is if I had any air to get away, will I have anything to live for any more.\\" He tells the audience that eventually he was found and locked in prison for 30 years without parole until Eddy got him out on a legal loophole after only serving 5 years in prison, getting a second chance to live a good life - a life that LaShawna and the baby would have approved of. As the movie ends, it shows Kool sitting by LaShawna's gravesite and having flashbacks of her, after which he tells the audience that a good life is worth living, because as long as he lives the memory of LaShawna lives on forever, and that love is something to believe in, and all he has now is memories.

These rules have been revised over the past four decades. They govern the process by which these two regulatory bodies scrutinize and/or challenge a potential merger. Grounds for challenges include increased market concentration and threat to competition within a relevant market. The merger guidelines have sections governing both horizontal integration and vertical integration. History  The first merger guidelines set forth by the DOJ were the 1968 Merger Guidelines. The guidelines were developed by former U.S. Assistant Attorney General Dr. Donald Turner, an economist and lawyer with expertise in the field of industrial organization.Oliver E. Williamson, The Merger Guidelines of the U.S. Department of Justice-In Perspective. Accessed November 4, 2007. These merger guidelines were criticized in some quarters for excess concern with issues of market structure such as barriers to entry and concentration ratios at the expense of efficiency and economies of scale.Remarks of Assistant Attorney General Charles A. James. They were, however, a step forward in two ways: they gave more accurate advice to corporate management as to when and how mergers would be examined and brought new economic ideas into antitrust enforcement, specifically the \\"structure-conduct-performance\\" model of industrial organization. They remained largely unchanged until 1982 when Associate Attorney General Bill Baxter, under the authority of U.S. Attorney General William French Smith, released a new set of guidelines, which made heavier use of modern concepts of microeconomic theory, including using the Herfindahl index to measure market concentration.Time magazine, \\"Guidelines for the Merger Thicket\\", June 28, 1982. Accessed September 12, 2007. The newer guidelines took a more favorable view of economies of scale and efficiency of production as rationales for integration. Moreover, they raised the level of market concentration necessary for the government to scrutinize mergers, effectively treating competition as a means to greater efficiency rather than as an independent goal.William J. Kolasky and Andrew R. Dick, The Merger Guidelines and the Integration of Efficiencies into Antitrust Review of Horizontal Mergers, 10 June 2002. Accessed September 12, 2007. This approach was controversial: some antitrust lawyers saw it as a loosening of previous restraints on corporate consolidation, and some State Attorneys General responded to Baxter's changes by tightening merger enforcement at the state level. The guidelines were revised again in 1984.1984 Merger Guidelines The only portion of the 1984 guidelines that remains in effect is Section Four, which governs the examination of market effects of vertical integration. These guidelines were replaced by the 1992 Merger Guidelines,1992 Merger Guidelines which fine-tuned previously established tools and policies, such as the SSNIP test and rules governing the acquisition of failing firms.Joshua R. Wueller, Mergers of Majors: Applying the Failing Firm Doctrine in the Recorded Music Industry, 7 Brook. J. Corp. Fin. & Com. L. 589, 591‚Äì92 (2013) (describing section 11 of the 2010 Guidelines (and section 5.1 of the earlier 1997 Guidelines), which governs the failing firm doctrine for the FTC and DOJ). The 1992 Guidelines were revised in 1997, almost concurrently with the FTC's challenge of the Staples-Office Depot merger in federal court. The 1997 Horizontal Merger Guidelines were replaced on August 19, 2010.2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines These guidelines introduced the concept of \\"upward pricing pressure\\" resulting from a merger between competing firms.

He was the Poet Laureate of Travancore and was known for Kesaveeyam, a mahakavya in Malayalam, two attakathas and several bhajans and kirtans. He also translated the Sanskrit text, Narayaniyam, into Malayalam under the title, Bhashanarayaniyam.  Biography  K. C. Kesava Pillai was born on February 4, 1868 in Paravur in Kollam district of Kerala in India to Valiyavelichathu Veettil Raman Pillai and Desathu Lakshmy Amma. His early schooling was at Paravur Malayalam School where he studied up to 5th standard and followed it up with Sanskrit studies under the tutelage of Paravur Kesavan Asan and grammar studies under Enakkattu Rajaraja Varma. As a boy, Pillai regularly watched Kathakali and learnt the basics of Kathakali literature, costumes and mudras, besides gaining proficiency in music. Aged 15, he wrote his first attakadha, Prahladacharitham. Simultaneously, he studied English with the help of a few friends while working as a Sanskrit teacher at a Vaidya School. In 1897, he joined as a Sanskrit teacher at a Malayalam school in Kollam but shifted to an English school in 1901 before moving to Thiruvananthapuram in 1901 as the teacher of Velayudhan Thampi, the son of Sree Moolam Thirunal, the then Maharajah of Travancore. Pillai married Kalyani Amma in 1890 but she died after two years. He married again in 1894; Nanikutty Amma, his father's niece, was the bride. A close associate of Pandalam Kerala Varma and A. R. Raja Raja Varma, Pillai died on September 4, 1913, at the age of 45 years. On account of his musical and poetical achievements, he was awarded the title of Sarasa Gayaka Kavimani by Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran. Noted writer and Sahitya Akademi Award winner, R. Narayana Panickar, was his son-in-law.  Legacy = Literary work  Kesava Pillai's body of literary work, written in Sanskrit and Malayalam languages, comprises an epic, three attakathas for Kathakali, two Thullal songs, eleven short poems, six khandakavyas, four plays, two stories and four commentaries. He wrote Prahlaada Charitham, later renamed, Hiranyasuravadham, the first of this three attakathas, when he was only 15. It was reported that Pillai, with his advice, assisted A. R. Rajaraja Varma in writing Vritha Manjari. His plays, such as Lakshmikalyanam, were reported to portray the social life of the Nair community of his times. Kesaviyam, a mahakavya and Kerala Varma Vilasam, a poem on the life of Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran are two of his major works. Kesaviyam has been written without observing the dvitƒ´yƒÅk·π£ara prƒÅsa (second syllable rhyming), which was in vogue during those times.  Music  Pillai composed six compositions, including Ganamalika, which has two volumes, besides over 100 songs. Sadarama, one of his compositions, is composed in the form of a Geya nataka, while Sangitamalika is an ensemble of 42 songs. The majority of his songs are devotional and are composed in ragas such as Todi, Sankarabharanam, Mohanam, Kapi, Kalyani and Pantuvarali. One of his songs, 'Omanappennallayo... has been reworked by the Malayalam music director, M. Jayachandran, for the 2010 film, Kadaksham.

He worked in what is now Andhra Pradesh, and became an important scholarly figure in Telugu language literature. Background Telugu literature was in a dormant phase in the 18th century, for a number of social and political reasons - a lack of creative Telugu poets, prevailing illiteracy and the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire as patrons of Telugu literature. Brown, as official in the region, collected and edited works. He believed he had saved the heritage of the Telugu language. In his own words, > \\"Telugu literature was dying out; the flame was flickering in the socket in > 1825, I found Telugu literature dead. In 30 years I raised it to life\\". Janamaddi Hanumath Sastri, who has researched Brown's life, established a library in Kadapa in his memory. Biography Charles Brown was born in Calcutta on 10 November 1798. His father David Brown was a manager of an orphanage and a missionary and scholar in many languages including Sanskrit. Charles Brown moved back to England in 1812 after his father's death, to obtain training from Haileybury College for a civil service position in India. He returned to Madras on 4 August 1817 In 1820, Thomas Munro, governor of Madras had ordered that every official should learn a local language. Brown chose Telugu, under the guidance of Velagapudi Kodandarama Panthulu, and passed a Telugu examination as well as the civil service examination that year. He became deputy to John Hanbury, the collector of Kadapa. Hanbury was fluent in Telugu and Brown continued to study. He was transferred to Machilipatnam in 1822 and then to Rajahmundry in 1825. Moved to Guntur at the beginning of the famine of 1832‚Äì3, he employed active methods, while dealing with sceptical superiors in Madras. Brown was relieved from his duties in 1834. He went back to London and stayed there from 1835 to 1838. Brown returned to Madras again in 1837 as a translator of Persian for the East India Company and joined as a member of the Madras College Board. He retired in 1854 because of health reasons and went back to London again. He worked at London University as Telugu Professor for some time. Legacy While Brown concentrated on Telugu,, Excerpts from the 1906 edition of Linguistic Survey of India (Telugu). he was a polyglot. Other languages Brown is said to have known were Greek, Latin, Persian and Sanskrit. He supported Telugu in three ways - he produced his own works, he recovered and discovered old works and he printed books in Telugu. He financed himself and sometimes borrowed to do so. He established two free schools in Cuddapah and two more in Machilipattanam. Brown's interests turned to Vemana's writings in 1824. He studied Telugu meter and grammar under the guidance of Venkatasivasastri Tippabhatla and Advaitabrahmasastri Vatthyam. He continued his study of Telugu literature in Rajahmundry from 1825. He collected rare manuscripts of Telugu kavyas (poems) and had them copied. He also collected essays, stories, and poems that existed as an oral literature. During his stay in London from 1835, he was employed by Horace Hayman Wilson in cataloguing South Indian language manuscripts from the East India House Library. Ultimately, many of those were sent back to Madras. Friedrich August Rosen encouraged his work on Telugu prosody, and had Brown's essay on it published in the Asiatic Journal. There, Brown advocated a more incisive approach, less reliant on Indian traditions, and levelled some criticisms at the old school of Henry Colebrooke, Sir William Jones and William Yates. He published in the Madras Journal of Literature and Science, on Colin Mackenzie's manuscript collection from 1838 to 1848.

Other publishings He had prepared commentaries for all of the published works so that non-scholars can understand them. Some of the publishings sponsored by him are: * Tale of Nala by Raghava in 1841. * The Calamities of Harischandra by Gaurana Mantri in 1842. * Nannaya's Andhra Mahabharatam in 1843 * Ramarajabhushanudu's Vasu Charitra in 1844 * Peddana's Manu Charitra in 1851. * Potana's Andhra Mahabhagavatam in 1848 along with Puranam Hayagreeva Sastry. * Tikkana's Andhra Mahabharatam in 1848 along with Puvvada Venkata Rao. * Srinatha's Palanadu Veera Charitra in 1852. He also left many press ready copies like Basavapurana, PanDitaaraadhya Charitra, Ranganaatha Ramayanam, 'Uttara Raamaayanam, Vijaya Vilasam, Sarangadhara Charitra, Hari Vamsam, Kasi Khandam, Aniruddha Charitra, Kuchelopakhyaanam, Radhika Santvanam, Vikramaarka charitra etc. They were published by different institutions in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh after his death. He also collected poems of Sumathi Satakam and Andhra Pradesh Sahitya Academy published it in 1973 acknowledging him. This is similar to Vemana Satakam that Brown published. Style He collected the stories and poems of common people and published them first. Though he was less interested in pedantic works, he also published many major Telugu works along with translations written by him or other copiers closely monitored by him. He prepared an index, a glossary and commentaries to all the works. Brown mentioned that the purpose of the commentary was to make the poems to be understood clearly without oral instructions. He also included many spoken words in his dictionary. There is no concrete evidence that Brown introduced any more than Sandhi breaks for the Telugu alphabet. The 1906 Linguistics Survey of India does not credit Brown for change in alphabets or making it easy for pronunciation. Death He died in 1884 on 12 December at the age of eighty-seven. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery (The General Cemetery of All Souls) in London.

Lyodura was introduced in 1969 as a product of B. Braun Melsungen AG, a leading hospital supply company based in Germany. The product was used as a quick and effective patch material for surgery on the brain. It was a section of freeze-dried tissue which could be stored for extended periods on hospital shelves and could be made ready for use simply by soaking it in water for a few minutes. What was not known by the consumer was the origin of the source material, the efficacy of its processing methods, and the danger of its use. The raw material for Lyodura was the dura mater of a human cadaver. The tissue would usually be harvested during an autopsy and then sold to the manufacturer. After neurological diseases were linked to use of Lyodura, an investigation determined that the manufacturer had obtained the donor tissue by black market methods. Autopsy staff would remove the tissue from cadavers, regardless of whether the deceased's family had agreed to an autopsy or not, and sell it in quantity to representatives of the manufacturer. Due to this illegal method of collection, no record of patient history accompanied the tissue to production. Large quantities of the harvested tissue would be mass sterilized in a heated vat. The tissue would then be freeze dried and packaged for purchase. The manufacturer believed that its sterilization procedure was sufficiently powerful to render any tissue harmless and was therefore unconcerned about cross-contamination from CJD-containing tissue to other tissue in the same sterilization vat. It is now believed that almost all Lyodura product was tainted with Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease through this process. An award-winning documentary was produced on the subject. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's The Fifth Estate segment, \\"Deadly Harvest\\", dealt with the product's history, sale in Canada, and health effects worldwide. According to the documentary, there have been more than 70 CJD-related deaths in Japan since Lyodura's distribution. The product has since been banned for use in Canada.

The series was created by the team of Barry Fanaro, Mort Nathan, Kathy Speer, and Terry Grossman, all of whom previously worked on The Golden Girls. Synopsis Following the death of her husband, Theresa Fanelli (Ann Morgan Guilbert) is prepared to sell the family business (a funeral home) to her son Anthony (Ned Eisenberg) and move from Brooklyn to Florida. Thwarting her plans are the arrival of her younger sons Ronnie (Andy Hirsch), who had just dropped out of school, and Frankie (Chris Meloni), whose engagement has just been broken. Another brother, the slightly disreputable Dom (Joe Pantoliano), is between hustles. Anthony learns that the funeral home is about $25,000 in debt, which he had not counted on. Soon, all of the boys are back at home with their mom, just like the old days. Advising the family, somewhat dubiously, are Theresa's brother, a Catholic priest known as \\"Father Angelo\\" (Richard Libertini), and fortune teller Philomena (Vera Lockwood). The Fanelli Boys showed fairly strong Italian-American ethnic stereotyping; there was even an Italian flag in the program's logo. The series garnered low ratings and was cancelled in February 1991 after airing nineteen episodes. Cast *Joe Pantoliano.....Dom Fanelli *Ann Morgan Guilbert.....Theresa Fanelli *Ned Eisenberg.....Anthony Fanelli *Chris Meloni.....Frankie Fanelli *Andy Hirsch.....Ronnie Fanelli *Richard Libertini.....Father Angelo *Vera Lockwood.....Philomena Title sequence The show's original opening sequence was filmed footage of a dining room table (presumably the Fanellis') as it was set by its family, followed by them sitting down and serving pasta and wine, which culminated in everyone toasting. Only the family's hands were seen during the entire sequence. This was accompanied by an instrumental, old-world Italian tune.

The bird is in size, with an wingspan. The petrel has various color morphs: dark and light, as well as intermediates between the two. Previously, two separate populations were considered conspecific, one occurring in the south Pacific, sometimes seen in Hawaii; the other occurring in the south Atlantic, nesting off Brazil, with regular sightings in the Gulf Stream off the southeastern United States. The little- known Pacific birds were then split and determined distinct as the herald petrel, Pterodroma heraldica. It uses oceanic islands and atolls, nesting on cliff ledges, ridges or rocky slopes. On some islands, nesting birds are threatened by feral cats and rats. Due to ongoing habitat loss and small breeding range, this species is evaluated as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The specific name is after Vittorio Arminjon, captain of the ship during on the voyage in which the specimen was collected.

In the multicomplex number systems one also requires that i_n i_m = i_m i_n (commutativity).

Each Cn forms a Banach algebra. G. Bayley Price has written about the function theory of multicomplex systems, providing details for the bicomplex system C2. The multicomplex number systems are not to be confused with Clifford numbers (elements of a Clifford algebra), since Clifford's square roots of ‚àí1 anti- commute (i_n i_m + i_m i_n = 0 when for Clifford). Because the multicomplex numbers have several square roots of ‚Äì1 that commute, they also have zero divisors: (i_n - i_m)(i_n + i_m) = i_n^2 - i_m^2 = 0 despite i_n - i_m eq 0 and i_n + i_m eq 0, and (i_n i_m - 1)(i_n i_m + 1) = i_n^2 i_m^2 - 1 = 0 despite i_n i_m eq 1 and i_n i_m eq -1. Any product i_n i_m of two distinct multicomplex units behaves as the j of the split-complex numbers, and therefore the multicomplex numbers contain a number of copies of the split- complex number plane.

REP's stated purpose is to strengthen the Republican Party's stance on environmental issues and support efforts to conserve natural resources and protect human and environmental health. Incorporated in Illinois, its headquarters are in Sturgis, Michigan. On March 30, 2012, REP President Rob Sisson and Chairwoman Tina Beattie announced that the organization would be changing its name to ConservAmerica. ConservAmerica had been the name of REP's sister 501(c)3 organization; that nonprofit is now called the Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship. History REP was founded in 1995 by three women, Martha Marks, who at the time was a member of the Lake County, Illinois, Board of County Commissioners; Kim O'Keefe-Wilkins; and Aurie Kryzuda. They met at an endangered species conference in Chevy Chase, Maryland. As lifelong Republicans, they were concerned that the new Republican majority in the 104th Congress was seeking to weaken the Clean Water Act and other environmental laws. In April 2012, ConservAmerica became a separate organization from REP led by Rob Sisson. The new group named itself \\"ConservAmerica\\", a name that it said represented \\"the inherent connection between conservation and conservatism\\". Mission \\"ConservAmerica's mission is to educate the public and elected officials on conservative approaches to today‚Äôs environmental, energy, and conservation challenges.\\" ConservAmerica's slogan, \\"Conservation is Conservative,\\" is based on the traditional conservative philosophy of writers and thinkers such as British statesman Edmund Burke, President Theodore Roosevelt, and authors Russell Kirk, author of The Conservative Mind: From Burke to Eliot, and Richard Weaver, author of Ideas Have Consequences. ConservAmerica argues in its literature that conservation and responsible environmental stewardship are core conservative values that necessarily extend from concepts such as prudence, personal responsibility, thrift and Burke's view that society is a partnership among past, present and future generations. ConservAmerica cites the conservation achievements of Republican leaders, including Abraham Lincoln's initial protection of Yosemite Valley and pioneering conservationist president, Theodore Roosevelt's establishment of national forests, monuments, parks, and wildlife refuges. Other Republican leaders often cited by REP for their conservation records include Presidents Herbert Hoover, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan, Senators John Chafee, William Roth and John McCain, Congressman John Saylor, and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Issue advocacy ConservAmerica advocates for conservation and environmental protection on a wide variety of environment and energy-related issues. The organization favors retention of environmental laws that were adopted with bipartisan support, such as the Wilderness Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Wild & Scenic Rivers Act.Some examples from its website: Military Leaders Sound Climate Alarm and Myths Power Critics of Solar and Wind Energy . Since 2018, ConservAmerica has focused on advocating for market-oriented approaches to addressing energy and climate issues. Jim Hansen's Conservative Climate Plan October 11, 2010 ConservAmerica advocates for reduced U.S. dependence on oil and other fossil fuels through more energy efficiency, and more use of renewable and nuclear energy. ConservAmerica's environmental policy positions are covered in the organization's website under the Issues tab and detailed in a variety of ConservAmerica policy papers. Political activity ConservAmerica endorses Republican candidates that the organization believes generally share its positions on environmental issues. As REP, the organization made endorsements in 2006, 2008, and 2010. In 2000 and in 2008, REP endorsed Senator John McCain for President. REP advised the McCain campaign on climate change mitigation. REP did not endorse George W. Bush in 2000 or 2004, and publicly opposed the 2001 nomination of Gale Norton as Secretary of the Interior. REP has an affiliated political action committee called REP PAC and an independent 527 group called the REP Conservation Fund. Both work to elect or defend Republicans who have what REP calls strong environmental credentials.

According to The New York Times, al-Awlaki's public statements and videos have been more influential in inspiring acts of terrorism in the wake of his killing than before his death. Al-Awlaki attended various universities across the United States in the 1990s and early 2000s while also working as an imam, despite having no religious qualifications and almost no religious education. He appeared on law enforcement's radars when federal investigators discovered three of the alleged 9/11 hijackers had attended the same mosque in Virginia during the same time Al-Awlaki served as imam, despite the fact that no solid evidence emerged linking Al-Awlaki to the 9/11 plot. In 2001, he presided at the funeral of the mother of Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, who later e-mailed him extensively, in 2008‚Äì09 before carrying out the Fort Hood shootings.

In June 2014, a previously classified memorandum issued by the U.S. Department of Justice was released, justifying al-Awlaki's death as a lawful act of war. Some civil liberties advocates have described the incident as \\"an extrajudicial execution\\" that breached al-Awlaki's right to due process, including a trial. Early life Al-Awlaki was born in Las Cruces, New Mexico, in 1971 to parents from Yemen, while his father, Nasser al-Awlaki, was doing graduate work at U.S. universities. His father was a Fulbright Scholar who earned a master's degree in agricultural economics at New Mexico State University in 1971, received a doctorate at the University of Nebraska, and worked at the University of Minnesota from 1975 to 1977. Nasser al-Awlaki served as Agriculture Minister in Ali Abdullah Saleh's government. He was also President of Sana'a University. Yemen's Prime Minister from 2007 to 2011, Ali Mohammed Mujur, was a relative. The family returned to Yemen in 1978, when al-Awlaki was seven years old. He lived there for 11 years, and studied at Azal Modern School.  Later life and alleged al-Qaeda ties =In the United States; 1990‚Äì2002 In 1991, al-Awlaki returned to the U.S. to attend college. He earned a B.S. in Civil Engineering from Colorado State University (1994), where he was president of the Muslim Student Association. He attended the university on a foreign student visa and a government scholarship from Yemen, claiming to be born in that country, according to a former U.S. security agent. In 1993, while still a college student in Colorado State's civil engineering program, al-Awlaki visited Afghanistan in the aftermath of the Soviet occupation. He spent some time training with the mujahideen who were fighting the Soviets. He was depressed by the country's poverty and hunger, and \\"wouldn't have gone with al-Qaeda,\\" according to friends from Colorado State, who said he was profoundly affected by the trip. Mullah Mohammed Omar did not form the Taliban until 1994. When Al-Awlaki returned to campus, he showed increased interest in religion and politics. Al-Awlaki studied Education Leadership at San Diego State University, but did not complete his degree. He worked on a doctorate in Human Resource Development at The George Washington University Graduate School of Education and Human Development from January to December 2001. In 1994, al-Awlaki married a cousin from Yemen, and began service as a part-time imam of the Denver Islamic Society. In 1996, he was chastised by an elder for encouraging a Saudi student to fight in Chechnya against the Russians. He left Denver soon after, moving to San Diego. From 1996 to 2000, al-Awlaki was imam of the Masjid Ar-Ribat al-Islami mosque in San Diego, California, where he had a following of 200‚Äì300 people. U.S. officials later alleged that Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77, attended his sermons and personally met him during this period. Hazmi later lived in Northern Virginia and attended al- Awlaki's mosque there. The 9/11 Commission Report said that the hijackers \\"reportedly respected [al-Awlaki] as a religious figure\\". While in San Diego, al-Awlaki volunteered with youth organizations, fished, discussed his travels with friends, and created a popular and lucrative series of recorded lectures. In August 1996 and in April 1997, al-Awlaki was arrested in San Diego and charged with soliciting prostitutes. The first time, in 1996, he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was fined $400 and required to attend informational sessions about AIDS. The second time, in 1997, he pleaded guilty and was fined $240, ordered to perform 12 days of community service, and received three years' probation. From November 2001 to January 2002 the FBI observed him visiting a number of prostitutes, and interviewed them, establishing that he had paid for sex acts. No prosecution was brought. In 1998 and 1999, he served as vice-president for the Charitable Society for Social Welfare. In 2004, the FBI described this group as a \\"front organization to funnel money to terrorists\\". Although the FBI investigated al-Awlaki from June 1999 through March 2000 for possible links to Hamas, the Bin Laden contact Ziyad Khaleel, and a visit by an associate of Omar Abdel Rahman, it did not find sufficient evidence for a criminal prosecution. Al-Awlaki told reporters that he resigned from leading the San Diego mosque \\"after an uneventful four years,\\" and took a brief sabbatical, traveling overseas to various countries. In January 2001 al-Awlaki returned to the U.S., settling in the Washington metropolitan area. There, he was imam at the Dar al-Hijrah mosque near Falls Church, Virginia and his services were attended by Nawaf al- Hazmi and a third hijacker Hani Hanjour He led academic discussions frequented by FBI Director of Counter-Intelligence for the Middle East Gordon M. Snow. Al-Awlaki also served as the Muslim chaplain at George Washington University, where he was hired by Esam Omeish. Omeish said in 2004 that he was convinced that al-Awlaki was not involved in terrorism. His proficiency as a public speaker and command of the English language helped him attract followers who did not speak Arabic. \\"He was the magic bullet\\", according to the mosque spokesman Johari Abdul-Malik. \\"He had everything all in a box.\\" \\"He had an allure. He was charming.\\" When police investigating the 9/11 attacks raided the Hamburg apartment of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, they found the telephone number of al-Awlaki among bin al-Shibh's personal contacts. The FBI interviewed al-Awlaki four times in the eight days following the 9/11 attacks. One detective later told the 9/11 Commission he believed al-Awlaki \\"was at the center of the 9/11 story\\". And an FBI agent said, \\"if anyone had knowledge of the plot, it would have been\\" him, since \\"someone had to be in the U.S. and keep the hijackers spiritually focused\\". One 9/11 Commission staff member said: \\"Do I think he played a role in helping the hijackers here, knowing they were up to something? Yes. Do I think he was sent here for that purpose? I have no evidence for it.\\" A separate Congressional Joint Inquiry into the 9/11 attacks suggested that al-Awlaki may have been connected to the hijackers, according to its director, Eleanor Hill. In 2003, Representative Anna Eshoo, a member of the House Intelligence Committee said, \\"In my view, he is more than a coincidental figure.\\" Six days after the 9/11 attacks, al-Awlaki suggested in writing on the IslamOnline.net website that Israeli intelligence agents might have been responsible for the attacks, and that the FBI \\"went into the roster of the airplanes, and whoever has a Muslim or Arab name became the hijacker by default\\". Soon after the 9/11 attacks, al-Awlaki was sought in Washington, D.C., by the media to answer questions about Islam, its rituals, and its relation to the attacks. He was interviewed by National Geographic,Brian Handwerk and Zain Habboo, \\"Attack on America: An Islamic Scholar's Perspective‚ÄîPart 1\\", National Geographic News, September 28, 2001, Retrieved on October 1, 2011 The New York Times, and other media. Al-Awlaki condemned the attacks. According to an NPR report in 2010, in 2001 al-Awlaki appeared to be a moderate who could \\"bridge the gap between the United States and the worldwide community of Muslims.\\" The New York Times said at the time that he was \\"held up as a new generation of Muslim leader capable of merging East and West.\\" In 2010, Fox News and the New York Daily News reported that some months after the 9/11 attacks, a Pentagon employee invited al-Awlaki to a luncheon in the Secretary's Office of General Counsel. The U.S. Secretary of the Army had suggested that a moderate Muslim be invited to give a talk. In 2002, al-Awlaki was the first imam to conduct a prayer service for the Congressional Muslim Staffer Association at the U.S. Capitol. The prayers were for Muslim congressional staffers and officials for the Council on American- Islamic Relations. That year, Nidal Malik Hasan visited al-Awlaki's mosque for his mother's funeral, at which al-Awlaki presided. In November 2009 Hasan killed 13 and wounded 32 in the Fort Hood shooting. Hasan usually attended a mosque in Maryland closer to where he lived while working at the Walter Reed Medical Center (2003‚Äì09). Later in 2002, al-Awlaki posted an essay in Arabic on the Islam Today website titled \\"Why Muslims Love Death\\", lauding the fervor of Palestinian suicide bombers. He expressed a similar opinion in a speech at a London mosque later that year. By July 2002, al-Awlaki was under investigation in the United States for having received money from the subject of a U.S. Joint Terrorism Task Force investigation. His name was added to the list of terrorism suspects. In June 2002, a Denver federal judge signed an arrest warrant for al-Awlaki for passport fraud. On October 9, the Denver U.S. Attorney's Office filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and vacate the arrest warrant. Prosecutors believed that they lacked sufficient evidence of a crime, according to U.S. Attorney Dave Gaouette, who authorized its withdrawal. Al-Awlaki had listed Yemen rather than the United States as his place of birth on his 1990 application for a U.S. Social Security number, soon after arriving in the US. Al-Awlaki used this documentation to obtain a passport in 1993. He later corrected his place of birth to Las Cruces, New Mexico. \\"The bizarre thing is if you put Yemen down (on the application), it would be harder to get a Social Security number than to say you are a native- born citizen of Las Cruces\\", Gaouette said. Prosecutors could not charge him in October 2002, when he returned from a trip abroad, because a 10-year statute of limitations on lying to the Social Security Administration had expired. According to a 2012 investigative report by Fox News, the arrest warrant for passport fraud was still in effect on the morning of October 10, 2002, when FBI Agent Wade Ammerman ordered al-Awlaki's release. U.S. Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA) and several congressional committees urged FBI Director Robert Mueller to provide an explanation about the bureau's interactions with al-Awlaki, including why he was released from federal custody when there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest. The motion for rescinding the arrest warrant was approved by a magistrate judge on October 10 and filed on October 11. ABC News reported in 2009 that the Joint Terrorism Task Force in San Diego disagreed with the decision to cancel the warrant. They were monitoring al-Awlaki and wanted to \\"look at him under a microscope\\". But U.S. Attorney Gaouette said that no objection had been raised to the rescinding of the warrant during a meeting that included Ray Fournier, the San Diego federal diplomatic security agent whose allegation had set in motion the effort to obtain a warrant. Gaouette said that if al-Awlaki had been convicted at the time, he would have faced about six months in custody. The New York Times suggested later that al-Awlaki had claimed birth in Yemen (his family's place of origin) to qualify for scholarship money granted to foreign citizens. U.S. Congressman Frank R. Wolf (R-VA) wrote in May 2010 that by claiming to be foreign-born, al-Awlaki fraudulently obtained more than $20,000 in scholarship funds reserved for foreign students. While living in Northern Virginia, al- Awlaki visited Ali al-Timimi, later known as a radical Islamic cleric. Al- Timimi was convicted in 2005 and is now serving a life sentence for leading the Virginia Jihad Network, inciting Muslim followers to fight with the Taliban against the US. In the United Kingdom; 2002‚Äì04 Al-Awlaki left the United States before the end of 2002, because of a \\"climate of fear and intimidation\\" according to Imam Johari Abdul-Malik of the Dar al-Hijrah mosque. He lived in the UK for several months, where he gave talks attended by up to 200 people. He urged young Muslim followers: \\"The important lesson to learn here is never, ever trust a kuffar [disbeliever]. Do not trust them! [Their leaders] are plotting to kill this religion. They're plotting night and day.\\" \\"He was the main man who translated the jihad into English,\\" said a student who attended his lectures in 2003. He gave a series of lectures in December 2002 and January 2003 at the London Masjid al-Tawhid mosque, describing the rewards martyrs (Shahid) receive in paradise (Jannah). He began to gain supporters, particularly among young Muslims, and undertook a lecture tour of England and Scotland in 2002 in conjunction with the Muslim Association of Britain. He also lectured at \\"ExpoIslamia\\", an event held by Islamic Forum Europe. At the East London Mosque he told his audience: \\"A Muslim is a brother of a Muslim... he does not betray him, and he does not hand him over... You don't hand over a Muslim to the enemies.\\" In Britain's Parliament in 2003, Louise Ellman, MP for Liverpool Riverside, discussed the relationship between al-Awlaki and the Muslim Association of Britain, an alleged Muslim Brotherhood front organization founded by Kemal el-Helbawy, a senior member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. In Yemen; 2004‚Äì11 Al- Awlaki returned to Yemen in early 2004, where he lived in Shabwah Governorate with his wife and five children. He lectured at Iman University, headed by Abdul Majeed al-Zindani. The latter has been included on the UN 1267 Committee's list of individuals belonging to or associated with al-Qaeda. Al- Zindani denied having any influence over al-Awlaki, or that he had been his \\"direct teacher\\". Some believe that the school's curriculum deals mostly, if not exclusively, with radical Islamic studies, and promotes radicalism. American convert John Walker Lindh and other alumni have been associated with terrorist groups. On August 31, 2006, al-Awlaki was arrested with four others on charges of kidnapping a Shiite teenager for ransom, and participating in an al-Qaeda plot to kidnap a U.S. military attach√©. He was imprisoned in 2006 and 2007. He was interviewed around September 2007 by two FBI agents with regard to the 9/11 attacks and other subjects. John Negroponte, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, told Yemeni officials he did not object to al-Awlaki's detention. His name was on a list of 100 prisoners whose release was sought by al-Qaeda-linked militants in Yemen. After 18 months in a Yemeni prison, al- Awlaki was released on December 12, 2007, following the intercession of his tribe. According to a Yemeni security official, he was released because he had repented. He moved to his family home in Saeed, a hamlet in the Shabwa mountains. Moazzam Begg's Cageprisoners, an organization representing former Guantanamo detainees, campaigned for al-Awlaki's release when he was in prison in Yemen. Al-Awlaki told Begg in an interview shortly after his release that prior to his incarceration in Yemen, he had condemned the 9/11 attacks. In December 2008, al-Awlaki sent a communique to the Somali terrorist group, al- Shabaab, congratulating them. Al-Awlaki provided al-Qaeda members in Yemen with the protection of his powerful tribe, the Awlakis, against the government. The tribal code required it to protect those who seek refuge and assistance. This imperative has greater force when the person is a member of the tribe or a tribesman's friend. The tribe's motto is \\"We are the sparks of Hell; whoever interferes with us will be burned.\\" Al-Awlaki also reportedly helped negotiate deals with leaders of other tribes. Sought by Yemeni authorities who were investigating his al-Qaeda ties, al-Awlaki went into hiding in approximately March 2009, according to his father. By December 2009, al-Awlaki was on the Yemen government's most-wanted list. He was believed to be hiding in Yemen's Shabwa or Mareb regions, which are part of the so-called \\"triangle of evil\\". The area has attracted al-Qaeda militants, who seek refuge among local tribes unhappy with Yemen's central government. Yemeni sources originally said al-Awlaki might have been killed in a pre-dawn air strike by Yemeni Air Force fighter jets on a meeting of senior al-Qaeda leaders at a hideout in Rafd in eastern Shabwa, on December 24, 2009. But he survived. Pravda reported that the planes, using Saudi and U.S. intelligence, killed at least 30 al-Qaeda members from Yemen and abroad, and that an al-Awlaki house was \\"raided and demolished\\". On December 28 The Washington Post reported that U.S. and Yemeni officials said that al-Awlaki had been present at the meeting. Abdul Elah al-Shaya, a Yemeni journalist, said al-Awlaki called him on December 28 to report that he was well and had not attended the al-Qaeda meeting. Al-Shaya said that al-Awlaki was not tied to al-Qaeda. In March 2010, a tape featuring al-Awlaki was released in which he urged Muslims residing in the United States to attack their country of residence. =Reaching out to the United Kingdom= After 2006, al-Awlaki was banned from entering the United Kingdom. He broadcast lectures to mosques and other venues there via video-link from 2007 to 2009, on at least seven occasions at five locations in Britain. Noor Pro Media Events held a conference at the East London Mosque on January 1, 2009, showing a videotaped lecture by al-Awlaki; former Shadow Home Secretary Dominic Grieve expressed concern over his being featured. He gave video-link talks in England to an Islamic student society at the University of Westminster in September 2008, an arts center in East London in April 2009 (after the Tower Hamlets council gave its approval), worshippers at the Al Huda Mosque in Bradford, and a dinner of the Cageprisoners organization in September 2008 at the Wandsworth Civic Centre in South London. On August 23, 2009, al-Awlaki was banned by local authorities in Kensington and Chelsea, London, from speaking at Kensington Town Hall via videolink to a fundraiser dinner for Guantanamo detainees promoted by Cageprisoners. His videos, which discuss his Islamist theories, have circulated across the United Kingdom. Until February 2010, hundreds of audio tapes of his sermons were available at the Tower Hamlets public libraries. In 2009, the London-based Islam Channel carried advertisements for his DVDs and at least two of his video conference lectures. Other connections In 2008, Charles E. Allen, former U.S. Under-Secretary for Homeland Security, publicly warned that al-Awlaki allegedly was targeting Muslims with online lectures encouraging terrorist attacks. FBI agents identified al-Awlaki as a known, important \\"senior recruiter for al Qaeda\\", and a spiritual motivator. His name came up in a dozen terrorism plots in the US, UK, and Canada. The cases included suicide bombers in the 2005 London bombings, radical Islamic terrorists in the 2006 Toronto terrorism case, radical Islamic terrorists in the 2007 Fort Dix attack plot, the jihadist killer in the 2009 Little Rock military recruiting office shooting, and the 2010 Times Square bomber. In each case the suspects were devoted to al-Awlaki's message, which they listened to online and on CDs. Al- Awlaki's recorded lectures were heard by Islamist fundamentalists in at least six terror cells in the UK through 2009. Michael Finton (Talib Islam), who attempted in September 2009 to bomb the Federal Building and the adjacent offices of Congressman Aaron Schock in Springfield, Illinois, admired al- Awlaki and quoted him on his Myspace page. In addition to his website, al- Awlaki had a Facebook fan page with \\"fans\\" in the US, many of whom were high school students. Al-Awlaki also set up a website and blog on which he shared his views. Al-Awlaki influenced several other extremists to join terrorist organizations overseas and to carry out terrorist attacks in their home countries. Mohamed Alessa and Carlos Almonte, two American citizens from New Jersey who attempted to travel to Somalia in June 2010 to join the al-Qaeda- linked terrorist group Al Shabaab, allegedly watched several al-Awlaki videos and sermons in which he warned of future attacks against Americans in the United States and abroad.Anti-Defamation League: \\"Profile: Anwar al-Awlaki\\" August 6, 2010 Zachary Chesser, an American citizen who was arrested for attempting to provide material support to Al Shabaab, told federal authorities that he watched online videos featuring al-Awlaki and that he exchanged several e-mails with al-Awlaki.Anti-Defamation League: \\"Abu Talhah Al-Amrikee: An Extensive Online Footprint\\" August 6, 2010 In July 2010, Paul Rockwood was sentenced to eight years in prison for creating a list of 15 potential targets in the US, people he felt had desecrated Islam. Rockwood was a devoted follower of al-Awlaki, and had studied his works Constants on the Path to Jihad and 44 Ways to Jihad. In October 2008, Charles Allen, U.S. Under- Secretary of Homeland Security for Intelligence and Analysis, warned that al- Awlaki \\"targets U.S. Muslims with radical online lectures encouraging terrorist attacks from his new home in Yemen.\\" Responding to Allen, al-Awlaki wrote on his website in December 2008: \\"I would challenge him to come up with just one such lecture where I encourage 'terrorist attacks'\\". =Fort Hood shooter= Convicted Fort Hood shooter Nidal Malik Hasan Fort Hood shooter Nidal Malik Hasan was investigated by the FBI after intelligence agencies intercepted at least 18 e-mails between him and al-Awlaki between December 2008 and June 2009. Even before the contents of the e-mails were revealed, terrorism expert Jarret Brachman said that Hasan's contacts with al-Awlaki should have raised \\"huge red flags\\", because of his influence on radical English-speaking jihadis. Charles Allen, no longer in government, noted that there was no work-related reason for Hasan to be in touch with al-Awlaki. Former CIA officer Bruce Riedel opined: \\"E-mailing a known al-Qaeda sympathizer should have set off alarm bells. Even if he was exchanging recipes, the bureau should have put out an alert.\\" A DC-based Joint Terrorism Task Force operating under the FBI was notified of the e-mails and reviewed the information. Army employees were informed of the e-mails, but they didn't perceive any terrorist threat in Hasan's questions. Instead, they viewed them as general questions about spiritual guidance with regard to conflicts between Islam and military service and judged them to be consistent with legitimate mental health research about Muslims in the armed services. The assessment was that there was not sufficient information for a larger investigation. In one of the e-mails, Hasan wrote al-Awlaki: \\"I can't wait to join you [in the afterlife]\\". \\"It sounds like code words,\\" said Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer, a military analyst at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies. \\"That he's actually either offering himself up, or that he's already crossed that line in his own mind.\\" Yemeni journalist Abdulelah Hider Shaea interviewed al-Awlaki in November 2009. Al-Awlaki acknowledged his correspondence with Hasan. He said he \\"neither ordered nor pressured ... Hasan to harm Americans.\\" Al-Awlaki said Hasan first e-mailed him December 17, 2008, introducing himself by writing: \\"Do you remember me? I used to pray with you at the Virginia mosque.\\" Hasan said he had become a devout Muslim around the time al-Awlaki was preaching at Dar al-Hijrah, in 2001 and 2002, and al-Awlaki said 'Maybe Nidal was affected by one of my lectures.'\\" He added: \\"It was clear from his e-mails that Nidal trusted me. Nidal told me: 'I speak with you about issues that I never speak with anyone else.'\\" Al-Awlaki said Hasan arrived at his own conclusions regarding the acceptability of violence in Islam and said he was not the one to initiate this. Shaea said, \\"Nidal was providing evidence to Anwar, not vice versa.\\" Asked whether Hasan mentioned Fort Hood as a target in his e-mails, Shaea declined to comment. Al-Awlaki said the shooting was acceptable in Islam, however, because it was a form of jihad, as the West began the hostilities with the Muslims. Al-Awlaki said he \\"blessed the act because it was against a military target. And the soldiers who were killed were ... those who were trained and prepared to go to Iraq and Afghanistan\\". Al-Awlaki's e-mail conversations with Hasan were not released, and he was not placed on the FBI Most Wanted list, indicted for treason, or officially named as a co-conspirator with Hasan. The U.S. government was reluctant to classify the Fort Hood shooting as a terrorist incident, or identify any motive. The Wall Street Journal reported in January 2010 that al-Awlaki had not \\"played a direct role\\" in any of the attacks, and noted he had never been charged with a crime in the US. One of his fellow officers at Fort Hood said Hasan was enthusiastic about al-Awlaki. Some investigators believe al-Awlaki's teachings may have been instrumental in Hasan's decision to stage the attack. On his now-disabled website, al-Awlaki praised Hasan's actions, describing him as a hero. =Christmas Day \\"Underwear Bomber\\"= Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Northwest Airlines Flight 253 suspected bomber According to a number of sources, Al-Awlaki and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the convicted al-Qaeda attempted bomber of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on December 25, 2009, had contacts. In January 2010, CNN reported that U.S. \\"security sources\\" said that there is concrete evidence that al-Awlaki was Abdulmutallab's recruiter and one of his trainers, and met with him prior to the attack. In February 2010, al-Awlaki admitted in an interview published in al-Jazeera that he taught and corresponded with Abdulmutallab, but denied having ordered the attack. Representative Pete Hoekstra, the senior Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said officials in the Obama administration and officials with access to law enforcement information told him the suspect \\"may have had contact [with al-Awlaki]\\". The Sunday Times established that Abdulmutallab first met al-Awlaki in 2005 in Yemen, while he was studying Arabic. During that time the suspect attended lectures by al-Awlaki. NPR reported that according to unnamed U.S. intelligence officials he attended a sermon by al- Awlaki at the Finsbury Park Mosque. Khalid Mahmood, the Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, a former trustee of the mosque, expressed \\"grave misgivings\\" with regard to its stewardship. A spokesperson of the mosque stated that al-Awlaki had never spoken there or had even to his knowledge entered the building. Abdulmutallab was also reported by CBS News, The Daily Telegraph, and The Sunday Telegraph to have attended a talk by al-Awlaki at the East London Mosque, which al-Awlaki may have attended by video teleconference. The Sunday Telegraph later removed the report from its website following a complaint by the East London Mosque, which stated that \\"Anwar Al Awlaki did not deliver any talks at the ELM between 2005 and 2008, which is when the newspaper had falsely alleged that Abdullmutallab had attended such talks\\". Investigators who searched flats connected to Abdulmutallab in London said that he was a \\"big fan\\" of al-Awlaki, as al-Awlaki's blog and website had repeatedly been visited from those locations. According to federal sources, Abdulmutallab and al-Awlaki repeatedly communicated with one another in the year prior to the attack. \\"Voice-to-voice communication\\" between the two was intercepted during the fall of 2009, and one government source said al-Awlaki \\"was in some way involved in facilitating [Abdulmutallab]'s transportation or trip through Yemen. It could be training, a host of things.\\" NPR reported that intelligence officials suspected al-Awlaki may have told Abdulmutallab to go to Yemen for al-Qaeda training. Abdulmutallab told the FBI that al-Awlaki was one of his al-Qaeda trainers in Yemen. Others reported that Abdulmutallab met with al-Awlaki in the weeks leading up to the attack. The Los Angeles Times reported that according to a U.S. intelligence official, intercepts and other information point to connections between the two: > Some of the information ... comes from Abdulmutallab, who ... said that he > met with al-Awlaki and senior al-Qaeda members during an extended trip to > Yemen this year and that the cleric was involved in some elements of > planning or preparing the attack and in providing religious justification > for it. Other intelligence linking the two became apparent after the > attempted bombing, including communications intercepted by the National > Security Agency indicating that the cleric was meeting with \\"a Nigerian\\" in > preparation for some kind of operation. Yemen's Deputy Prime Minister for Defense and Security Affairs, Rashad Mohammed al-Alimi, said Yemeni investigators believe that Abdulmutallab traveled to Shabwa in October 2009. Investigators believe he obtained his explosives and received training there. He met there with al-Qaeda members in a house built by al-Awlaki. A top Yemen government official said the two met with each other. In January 2010, al-Awlaki acknowledged that he met and spoke with Abdulmutallab in Yemen in the fall of 2009. In an interview, al-Awlaki said: \\"Umar Farouk is one of my students; I had communications with him. And I support what he did.\\" He also said: \\"I did not tell him to do this operation, but I support it\\". Fox News reported in early February 2010 that Abdulmutallab told federal investigators that al-Awlaki directed him to carry out the bombing. In June 2010 Michael Leiter, the Director of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), said al-Awlaki had a \\"direct operational role\\" in the plot. =Sharif Mobley= Sharif Mobley had acknowledged contact with Anwar al-Awlaki. The Mobley family claims the contact was for spiritual guidance in further studies of Islam. The Mobley family went to Yemen and resided there for several years. They decided to return to the United States and went to the U.S. Embassy to update the family travel documents. While waiting for their travel documents, Sharif Mobley was kidnapped by Yemen Security Services and shot on January 26, 2010. He was then held in Yemen's Central Prison. Mobley disappeared from the Central Prison on February 27, 2014. His current location is known to the U.S. Embassy in Yemen (currently closed 2015) but is withheld from his family and legal advisers based on U.S. State Department Regulations on \\"U.S. Citizens Missing Abroad\\". All charges related to \\"terrorism/terrorist activity\\" were dropped by the Yemen government. There are no charges relating to allegations of \\"killing a guard during an escape attempt from the hospital\\" and there are no other legal proceedings against him in Yemen. =Times Square bomber= Faisal Shahzad, convicted of the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt, told interrogators that he was a \\"fan and follower\\" of al-Awlaki, and his writings were one of the inspirations for the attack. On May 6, 2010 ABC News reported that unknown sources told them Shahzad made contact with al-Awlaki over the internet, a claim that could not be independently verified. =Stabbing of British former minister Stephen Timms= Roshonara Choudhry, who stabbed former British Cabinet Minister Stephen Timms in May 2010, and was found guilty of his attempted murder in November 2010, claimed to have become radicalized by listening to online sermons of al-Awlaki. =Seattle Weekly cartoonist death threat= In 2010, after Everybody Draw Mohammed Day, cartoonist Molly Norris at Seattle Weekly had to stop publishing, and at the suggestion of the FBI changed her name, moved, and went into hiding due to a fatwƒÅ issued by al- Awlaki calling for her death. In the June 2010 issue of Inspire, an English- language al-Qaeda magazine, al-Awlaki cursed her and eight others for \\"blasphemous caricatures\\" of Muhammad. \\"The medicine prescribed by the Messenger of Allah is the execution of those involved\\", he wrote. Daniel Pipes observed in an article entitled \\"Dueling Fatwas\\", \\"Awlaki stands at an unprecedented crossroads of death declarations, with his targeting Norris even as the U.S. government targets him.\\" =Cargo planes bomb plot= The Guardian, The New York Times, and The Daily Telegraph reported that U.S. and British counter-terrorism officials believed that al-Awlaki was behind the cargo plane PETN bombs that were sent from Yemen to Chicago in October 2010.Yemen bomb scare 'mastermind' lived in London  World news. The Guardian. Retrieved on October 1, 2011. When U.S. Homeland Security official John Brennan was asked about al-Awlaki's suspected involvement in the plot, he said: \\"Anybody associated with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is a subject of concern.\\" U.S. Ambassador to Yemen Gerald Feierstein said \\"al-Awlaki was behind the two ... bombs.\\" Final years Al-Awlaki's father, tribe, and supporters denied his alleged associations with Al-Qaeda and Islamist terrorism. Al-Awlaki's father proclaimed his son's innocence in an interview with CNN's Paula Newton, saying: \\"I am now afraid of what they will do with my son. He's not Osama bin Laden, they want to make something out of him that he's not.\\" Responding to a Yemeni official's assertions that his son had taken refuge with al-Qaeda, Nasser said: \\"He's dead wrong. What do you expect my son to do? There are missiles raining down on the village. He has to hide. But he is not hiding with al-Qaeda; our tribe is protecting him right now.\\" The Yemeni government attempted to get the tribal leaders to release al-Awlaki to their custody. They promised they would not turn him over to U.S. authorities for questioning. The governor of Shabwa said in January 2010 that al-Awlaki was on the move with members of al-Qaeda, including Fahd al-Quso, who was wanted in connection with the bombing of the USS Cole. In January 2010, White House lawyers debated whether or not it was legal to kill al-Awlaki, given his U.S. citizenship. U.S. officials stated that international law allows targeted killing in the event that the subject is an \\"imminent threat\\". Because he was a U.S. citizen, his killing had to be approved by the National Security Council. Such action against a U.S. citizen is extremely rare. As a military enemy of the US, al-Awlaki was not subject to Executive Order 11905, which bans assassination for political reasons. The authorization was nevertheless controversial. By February 4, 2010, the New York Daily News reported that al- Awlaki was \\"now on a targeting list signed off on by the Obama administration\\". On April 6, The New York Times reported that President Obama had authorized the killing of al-Awlaki. The al-Awalik tribe responded: \\"We warn against cooperating with America to kill Sheikh Anwar al-Awlaki. We will not stand by idly and watch.\\" Al-Awlaki's tribe wrote that it would \\"not remain with arms crossed if a hair of Anwar al-Awlaki is touched, or if anyone plots or spies against him. Whoever risks denouncing our son (Awlaki) will be the target of Al-Awalik weapons\\", and gave warning \\"against co-operating with the Americans\\" in the capture or killing of al-Awlaki. Abu Bakr al-Qirbi, the Yemeni foreign minister, announced that the Yemeni government had not received any evidence from the US, and that \\"Anwar al-Awlaki has always been looked at as a preacher rather than a terrorist and shouldn't be considered as a terrorist unless the Americans have evidence that he has been involved in terrorism\\". In a video clip bearing the imprint of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, issued on April 16 in al-Qaeda's monthly magazine Sada Al-Malahem, al-Awlaki said: \\"What am I accused of? Of calling for the truth? Of calling for jihad for the sake of Allah? Of calling to defend the causes of the Islamic nation?\\" In the video he also praises both Abdulmutallab and Hasan, and describes both as his \\"students\\". In late April, Representative Charlie Dent (R-PA) introduced a resolution urging the U.S. State Department to withdraw al-Awlaki's U.S. citizenship. By May, U.S. officials believed he had become directly involved in terrorist activities. Former colleague Abdul-Malik said he \\"is a terrorist, in my book\\", and advised shops not to carry any of his publications. In an editorial, Investor's Business Daily called al-Awlaki the \\"world's most dangerous man\\", and recommended that he be added to the FBI's most-wanted terrorist list, a bounty put on his head, that he be designated a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, charged with treason, and extradition papers filed with the Yemeni government. IBD criticized the Justice Department for stonewalling Senator Joe Lieberman's security panel's investigation of al-Awlaki's role in the Fort Hood massacre. On July 16, the U.S. Treasury Department added him to its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists. Stuart Levey, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, called him \\"extraordinarily dangerous\\", and said al- Awlaki was involved in several organizational aspects of terrorism, including recruiting, training, fundraising, and planning individual attacks. A few days later, the United Nations Security Council placed al-Awlaki on its UN Security Council Resolution 1267 list of individuals associated with al-Qaeda, describing him as a leader, recruiter, and trainer for al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The resolution stipulates that U.N. members must freeze the assets of anyone on the list, and prevent them from travelling or obtaining weapons. The following week, Canadian banks were ordered to seize any assets belonging to al-Awlaki. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police's senior counter-terrorism officer Gilles Michaud described him as a \\"major, major factor in radicalization\\". In September 2010, Jonathan Evans, the Director General of the United Kingdom's domestic security and counter-intelligence agency (MI5), said that al-Awlaki was the West's Public Enemy No 1. In October 2010, U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner (D-NY) urged YouTube to take down al-Awlaki's videos from its website, saying that by hosting al-Awlaki's messages, \\"We are facilitating the recruitment of homegrown terror.\\" Pauline Neville-Jones, British security minister, said \\"These Web sites ... incite cold-blooded murder.\\" YouTube began removing the material in November 2010. Al-Awlaki was charged in absentia in Sana'a, Yemen, on November 2 with plotting to kill foreigners and being a member of al-Qaeda. Ali al-Saneaa, the head of the prosecutor's office, announced the charges during the trial of Hisham Assem, who had been accused of killing Jacques Spagnolo, an oil industry worker. He said that al-Awlaki and Assem had been in contact for months, and that al- Awlaki had encouraged Assem to commit terrorism. Al-Awlaki's lawyer said that his client was not connected to Spagnolo's death. On November 6, Yemeni Judge Mohsen Alwan ordered that al-Awlaki be caught \\"dead or alive\\". In his book Ticking Time Bomb: Counter-Terrorism Lessons from the U.S. Government's Failure to Prevent the Fort Hood Attack (2011), former U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman described al-Awlaki, Australian Muslim preacher Feiz Mohammad, Muslim cleric Abdullah el-Faisal, and Pakistani-American Samir Khan as \\"virtual spiritual sanctioners\\" who use the internet to offer religious justification for Islamist terrorism. Lawsuit against the US In July 2010, al-Awlaki's father, Nasser al-Awlaki, contacted the Center for Constitutional Rights and the American Civil Liberties Union to represent his son in a lawsuit that sought to remove Anwar from the targeted killing list.CCR, \\"CCR and the ACLU v. OFAC & Al-Aulaqi v. Obama\\" ACLU's Jameel Jaffer said: > the United States is not at war in Yemen, and the government doesn't have a > blank check to kill terrorism suspects wherever they are in the world. Among > the arguments we'll be making is that, outside actual war zones, the > authority to use lethal force is narrowly circumscribed, and preserving the > rule of law depends on keeping this authority narrow. Lawyers for Specially Designated Global Terrorists must obtain a special license from the U.S. Treasury Department before they can represent their clients in court. The lawyers were granted the license on August 4, 2010. On August 30, 2010, the groups filed a \\"targeted killing\\" lawsuit, naming President Obama, CIA Director Leon Panetta, and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates as defendants. They sought an injunction preventing the targeted killing of al-Awlaki, and also sought to require the government to disclose the standards under which U.S. citizens may be \\"targeted for death\\". Judge John D. Bates dismissed the lawsuit in an 83-page ruling, holding that the father did not have legal standing to bring the lawsuit, and that his claims were judicially unreviewable under the political question doctrine inasmuch as he was questioning a decision that the U.S. Constitution committed to the political branches. On May 5, 2011, the United States tried but failed to kill al-Awlaki by firing a missile from an unmanned drone at a car in Yemen. A Yemeni security official said that two al-Qaeda operatives in the car died. Death On September 30, 2011, al-Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Al Jawf Governorate, Yemen, according to U.S. sources, the strike was carried out by Joint Special Operations Command, under the direction of the CIA.Griffin, Jennifer. (April 7, 2010) Two U.S.-Born Terrorists Killed In CIA- Led Drone Strike. Fox News. Retrieved on October 1, 2011. A witness said the group had stopped to eat breakfast while traveling to Ma'rib Governorate. The occupants of the vehicle spotted the drone and attempted to flee in the vehicle before Hellfire missiles were fired Yemen's Defense Ministry announced that al-Awlaki had been killed. Also killed was Samir Khan, an American born in Saudi Arabia, thought to be behind al-Qaeda's English-language web magazine Inspire.Goodman, J. David (September 30, 2011). American Who Waged 'Media Jihad' Is Said to Be Killed in Awlaki Strike. The New York Times U.S. President Barack Obama said: > The death of Awlaki is a major blow to Al-Qaeda's most active operational > affiliate.

[The strike] is further proof that Al-Qaeda and > its affiliates will find no safe haven anywhere in the world. Journalist and author Glenn Greenwald argued on Salon.com that killing al- Awlaki violated his First Amendment right of free speech and that doing so outside of a criminal proceeding violated the Constitution's due process clause, specifically citing the 1969 Supreme Court decision in Brandenburg v. Ohio that \\"the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force.\\"Greenwald, Glenn (June 1, 2011). Criminalizing free speech Salon He mentioned doubt among Yemeni experts about al-Awlaki's role in al-Qaeda, and called U.S. government accusations against him unverified and lacking in evidence.Greenwald, Glenn (September 30, 2011). The due-process-free assassination of U.S. citizens is now reality Salon In a letter dated May 22, 2013, to the chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary committee, Patrick J. Leahy, U.S. attorney general Eric Holder wrote that > high-level U.S. government officials [...] concluded that al-Aulaqi posed a > continuing and imminent threat of violent attack against the United States. > Before carrying out the operation that killed al-Aulaqi, senior officials > also determined, based on a careful evaluation of the circumstances at the > time, that it was not feasible to capture al-Aulaqi.

The operation was also undertaken consistent with > Yemeni sovereignty. [...] The decision to target Anwar al-Aulaqi was lawful, > it was considered, and it was just. On April 21, 2014, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal ruled that the Obama administration must release documents justifying its drone killings of foreigners and Americans, including Anwar al-Awlaki. In June 2014, the United States Department of Justice disclosed a 2010 memorandum written by the acting head of the department's Office of Legal Counsel, David Barron. The memo stated that Anwar al-Awlaki was a significant threat with an infeasible probability of capture. Barron therefore justified the killing as legal, as \\"the Constitution would not require the government to provide further process\\". The New York Times Editorial Board dismissed the memo's rationale for al-Awlaki's killing, saying it \\"provides little confidence that the lethal action was taken with real care\\", instead describing it as \\"a slapdash pastiche of legal theories‚Äîsome based on obscure interpretations of British and Israeli law‚Äîthat was clearly tailored to the desired result.\\" A lawyer for the ACLU described the memo as \\"disturbing\\" and \\"ultimately an argument that the president can order targeted killings of Americans without ever having to account to anyone outside the executive branch.\\" Legacy Seth Jones, who as a political scientist specializes in al-Qaida, considers that the continuing relevance of al-Awlaki is due to his fluency in the English language as well as his charisma, precising that \\"he had a disarming aura and unnerving confidence, with an easy smile and a soothing, eloquent voice. He stood a lanky six feet, one inch tall, weighed 160 pounds, and had a thick black beard, an oversized nose, and wire-rimmed glasses. He spoke in a clear, almost hypnotic voice.\\"Seth G. Jones, Hunting in the Shadows: The Pursuit of al Qa'ida since 9/11: The Pursuit of al Qa'ida since 9/11, W. W. Norton & Company, 2012, p. 293. Awlaki's videos and writings remain highly popular on the internet, where they continue to be readily accessible. Those who viewed and still view his videos are estimated by journalist Scott Shane to number in the hundreds of thousands,Scott Shane (17 September 2016), \\"An Al Qaeda Martyr's Enduring Pitch\\", The New York Times. Retrieved 30 March 2020. while his father Dr. Nasser Awlaqi says that \\"five million preaching tapes of Anwar Awlaqi have been sold in the West.\\"Hakim Almasmari (10 April 2010), \\"Dr. Nasser Awlaqi, Father of Sheikh Anwar Awlaqi\\", Yemen Post. Retrieved 30 March 2020. And thus, even following his death, Awlaki has continued to inspire his devotees to carry out terrorist attacks, including the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, the 2015 San Bernardino attack, and the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. According to the Counter Extremism Project (CEP), 88 \\"extremists,\\" 54 in the U.S. and 34 in Europe, have been influenced by Awlaki. Because \\"his work has inspired countless plots and attacks,\\" CEP has \\"called on YouTube and other platforms to permanently ban Mr. Awlaki's material, including his early, mainstream lectures.\\" FOIA documents During the FBI investigation of the 9/11 attacks, it was discovered that a few of the attackers had attended the mosques in San Diego and Falls Church with which al-Awlaki was associated. Interviews with members of the San Diego mosque showed that Nawaz al-Hazmi, one of the attackers, may have had a private conversation with him. On that basis he was placed under 24-hour surveillance. It was discovered that he regularly patronized prostitutes. It was through FBI interrogation of prostitutes and escort service operators that al-Awlaki was tipped off in 2002 about FBI surveillance. Shortly thereafter, he left the United States. In January 2013, Fox News announced that FBI documents obtained by Judicial Watch through a Freedom of Information Act request showed possible connections between al-Awlaki and the September 11 attackers. According to Judicial Watch, the documents show that the FBI knew that al-Awlaki had bought tickets for three of the hijackers to fly into Florida and Las Vegas. Judicial Watch further stated that al-Awlaki \\"was a central focus of the FBI's investigation of 9/11. They show he wasn't cooperative. And they show that he was under surveillance.\\" When queried by Fox News, the FBI denied having evidence connecting al-Awlaki and the September 11 attacks: \\"The FBI cautions against drawing conclusions from redacted FOIA documents. The FBI and investigating bodies have not found evidence connecting Anwar al-Awlaki and the attack on September 11, 2001. The document referenced does not link Anwar al-Awlaki with any purchase of airline tickets for the hijackers.\\" Family=Abdulrahman al-Awlaki Anwar al-Awlaki and Egyptian-born Gihan Mohsen Baker had a son, Abdulrahman Anwar al-Awlaki, born August 26, 1995, in Denver, who was an American citizen. Abdulrahman al-Awlaki was killed on October 14, 2011, in Yemen at the age of 16 in an American drone strike. Nine other people were killed in the same CIA-initiated attack, including a 17-year-old cousin of Abdulrahman. According to his relatives, shortly before his father's death, Abdulrahman had left the family home in Sana'a and travelled to Shabwa in search of his father who was believed to be in hiding in that area (though he was actually hundreds of miles away at the time ). Abdulrahman was sitting in an open-air cafe in Shabwa when killed. According to U.S. officials, the killing of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki was a mistake; the intended target was an Egyptian, Ibrahim al-Banna, who was not at the targeted location at the time of the attack. Human rights groups have raised questions as to why an American citizen was killed by the United States in a country with which the United States is not officially at war. Abdulrahman al-Awlaki was not known to have any independent connection to terrorism. Nasser al-Awlaki Nasser al- Awlaki is the father of Anwar and grandfather of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki. Al- Awlaki stated he believed his son had been wrongly accused and was not a member of Al Qaeda. After the deaths of his son and grandson, Nasser in an interview in Time Magazine called the killings a crime and condemned U.S. President Obama directly, saying: \\"I urge the American people to bring the killers to justice. I urge them to expose the hypocrisy of the 2009 Nobel Prize laureate. To some, he may be that. To me and my family, he is nothing more than a child killer.\\" In 2013, Nasser al-Awlaki published an op-ed in The New York Times stating that two years after killing his grandson, the Obama administration still declines to provide an explanation. In 2012, Nasser al-Awlaki filed a lawsuit, Al-Aulaqi v. Panetta, challenging the constitutionality of the drone killings of his son and grandson. This lawsuit was dismissed in April 2014 by D.C. District Court Judge Rosemary M. Collyer. Tariq al-Dahab Tariq al-Dahab, who led al-Qaeda insurgents in Yemen, was a brother-in-law of al-Awlaki. On February 16, 2012, the terrorist organization stated that he had been killed by agents, although media reports contain speculation that he was killed by his brother in a bloody family feud.Awlaki relative led Yemeni raid, upi.com (January 16, 2012) Nawar al- Awlaki On January 29, 2017, Anwar al-Awlaki's 8-year-old daughter, Nawar al-Awlaki, was killed in a DEVGRU attack ordered by President Donald Trump. Islamic education Al-Awlaki's Islamic education was primarily informal, and consisted of intermittent months with various scholars (including the Salafi teacher ibn Uthaymeen),Denis MacEion, Middle East Quarterly, Spring 2010, p 13 -19. reading and contemplating Islamic scholarly works. Some Muslim scholars said they did not understand alAwlaki's popularity, because while he spoke fluent English and could therefore reach a large non-Arabic-speaking audience, he lacked formal Islamic training and study. Ideology While imprisoned in Yemen after 2004, al-Awlaki was influenced by the works of Sayyid Qutb, described by The New York Times as an originator of the contemporary \\"anti-Western Jihadist movement\\". He read 150 to 200 pages a day of Qutb's works, and described himself as \\"so immersed with the author I would feel Sayyid was with me in my cell speaking to me directly\\". Terrorism consultant Evan Kohlmann in 2009 referred to al-Awlaki as \\"one of the principal jihadi luminaries for would-be homegrown terrorists. His fluency with English, his unabashed advocacy of jihad and mujahideen organizations, and his Web-savvy approach are a powerful combination.\\" He called al-Awlaki's lecture, \\"Constants on the Path of Jihad\\", which he says was based on a similar document written by al-Qaeda's founder, the \\"virtual bible for lone- wolf Muslim extremists\\". Philip Mudd, formerly of the CIA's National Counterterrorism Center and the FBI's top intelligence adviser, called him \\"a magnetic character ... a powerful orator.\\" He attracted young men to his lectures, especially US-based and UK-based Muslims. U.S. officials and some U.S. media sources called al-Awlaki an Islamic fundamentalist and accused him of encouraging terrorism. According to documents recovered from bin Laden's hideout, the al-Qaeda leader was unsure about al-Awlaki's qualifications. Works The Nine Eleven Finding Answers Foundation said al-Awlaki's ability to write and speak in fluent English enabled him to incite English-speaking Muslims to terrorism. Al-Awlaki notes in 44 Ways to Support Jihad that most reading material on the subject is in Arabic. Written works * 44 Ways to Support Jihad: Essay (January 2009). In it, al-Awlaki states that \\"The hatred of kuffar is a central element of our military creed\\" and that all Muslims are obligated to participate in jihad, either by committing the acts themselves or supporting others who do so. He says all Muslims must remain physically fit so as to be prepared for conflict. According to U.S. officials, it is considered a key text for al-Qaeda members. * Al-Awlaki wrote for Jihad Recollections, an English language online publication published by Al-Fursan Media. * Allah is Preparing Us for Victory ‚Äì short book (2009).

On December 11, 2008, he said Muslims should not seek to \\"serve in the armies of the disbelievers and fight against his brothers\\". In \\"44 Ways to Support Jihad\\", posted on his blog in February 2009, al-Awlaki encouraged others to \\"fight jihad\\", and explained how to give money to the mujahideen or their families. Al-Awlaki's sermon encourages others to conduct weapons training, and raise children \\"on the love of Jihad\\". Also that month, he wrote: \\"I pray that Allah destroys America and all its allies.\\" He wrote as well: \\"We will implement the rule of Allah on Earth by the tip of the sword, whether the masses like it or not.\\" On July 14, he said that Muslim countries should not offer military assistance to the US. \\"The blame should be placed on the soldier who is willing to follow orders ... who sells his religion for a few dollars,\\" he said. In blog post dated July 15, 2009, entitled \\"Fighting Against Government Armies in the Muslim World\\", al- Awlaki wrote, \\"Blessed are those who fight against [American soldiers], and blessed are those shuhada [martyrs] who are killed by them.\\" In a video posted to the internet on November 8, 2010, al-Awlaki called for Muslims to kill Americans \\"without hesitation\\", and overthrow Arab governments that cooperate with the US. \\"Don't consult with anyone in fighting the Americans, fighting the devil doesn't require consultation or prayers or seeking divine guidance. They are the party of the devils\\", al-Awlaki said. That month, Intelligence Research Specialist Kevin Yorke of the New York Police Department's Counterterrorism Division called him \\"the most dangerous man in the world\\".

Her research interests include interactions between the environment and human well-being, biodiversity, climate change, and sustainable use of oceans and the planet. From 2009 to 2013, she served as Administrator of NOAA and Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere. After resigning from NOAA, she was the Mimi and Peter Haas Distinguished Visitor in Public Service at Stanford University (March‚ÄìJune 2013). In June 2013, she returned to Oregon State University where she was on the faculty prior to being invited by President-Elect Obama to serve on his 'science team.' Her many awards include the MacArthur 'genius' award in 1993 and more than 15 Honorary Degrees. In 2002, Discover magazine recognized Lubchenco as one of the 50 most important women in science.  Early life and education  Lubchenco was born on December 4, 1947, and grew up in Denver, Colorado, the oldest of six sisters. Her father, Michael Lubchenco, a surgeon from South Carolina, was of Ukrainian, French, English, Scottish and Irish descent and her mother, LaMeta Dahl Lubchenco, a pediatrician from North Dakota and Minnesota, had Norwegian, French and English ancestry. Lubchenco attended St. Mary's Academy, a Catholic girls high school. She studied as a Ford Independent Studies scholar at Colorado College in Colorado Springs, graduating with a B.A. in biology in 1969. During college, a summer class in invertebrate zoology at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, sparked her interest in marine biology and research. She attended graduate school at the University of Washington where she combined experimental and evolutionary approaches to marine ecology for her thesis on competition between sea stars. Lubchenco graduated with an M.S. in zoology in 1971 and then a Ph.D. in 1975 in marine ecology at Harvard University. Her dissertation dealt with the population and community ecology of rocky sea shores in New England, in particular the role of herbivores, competition among seaweeds, and seaweed defenses against grazers.  Academic career  After obtaining her Ph.D. in 1975, Lubchenco was hired as an assistant professor at Harvard University. In 1977, she and her husband, moved to Oregon State University (OSU) in Corvallis, Oregon, where she was assistant professor (1977-1982), associate professor (1982-1988) and full professor (1988-2009, 2013‚Äìpresent) Lubchenco served as chair of the Department of Zoology from 1989-1992 and in 1993 was named Distinguished Professor of Zoology. In 1995, she and her husband, Dr. Bruce Menge, were both named Wayne and Gladys Valley Professors of Marine Biology, endowed chair positions in the Department of Zoology. One unique aspect of Lubchenco's position at Oregon State University was the pioneering appointment she and her husband negotiated with the University. To attract them, the University split a single assistant professor position into two, separate, half-time but tenure-track positions. The novel arrangement allowed each of them to spend considerable time with their family while also teaching and doing research. This two half-time, tenure-track arrangement for a couple seems to have been the first in the U.S., although thousands of couples have since negotiated similar positions. Each worked half-time for ten years, then three-quarters-time for two years before returning to full-time in 1989, all at OSU. Lubchenco took a leave of absence from Oregon State University to serve as NOAA Administrator (2009-2013). After spending three months as Haas Distinguished Visitor in Public Service at Stanford University in the spring of 2013, she returned to OSU. Lubchenco has also been a Research Associate at the Smithsonian Institution (1978-1984) while she conducted research at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. She has also taught courses or conducted extended research at the University of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica (1976); Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile (1986); Institute of Oceanography, Academia Sinica, Qingdao, China (1987); and University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand (1994‚Äì95, 1999‚Äì2000, 2002‚Äì03).  Science communication  Throughout her career, Lubchenco has emphasized the responsibilities scientists have to society and the importance of effective communication between scientists and society. In her 1997 address as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, she focused on scientists' \\"social contract\\" with society, i.e. their obligation to not only create new knowledge that is helpful to society but also to share that knowledge widely, not just with other scientists. She created three organizations devoted to helping scientists become better communicators. In 1998 and 1999, respectively, she founded the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program and COMPASS that train scientists to communicate their research more effectively to citizens, the media, policymakers and business leaders. In 2007, Lubchenco co-founded Climate Central, a not-for-profit, non-advocacy organization whose mission is to communicate the science of climate change to U.S. audiences in a manner that is understandable, relevant, credible and useful. Lubchenco builds bridges between the scientific community and the general public through her public lectures, writing, and service to various scientific, non-governmental and governmental organizations. She has been a member of the Pew Oceans Commission, the Joint Oceans Commission Initiative, the Aspen Institute Arctic Commission, and the Council of Advisors for Google Ocean. Scientific leadership Lubchenco has served the scientific community through leadership in numerous professional societies. She was president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS; 1997-8), the International Council for Science (ICSU; 2002-5), and the Ecological Society of America (1992‚Äì93). She served two terms as a Presidentially nominated, Senate- confirmed Member of the National Science Board (1996-2006) and was elected to the Council of the National Academy of Sciences and appointed to its Executive Committee. She has been on the editorial boards of many of the major journals in her field. Sustainability science Lubchenco led the effort of the Ecological Society of America to identify scientific research priorities (biodiversity, climate change and sustainability science); this effort, called the Sustainable Biosphere Initiative (SBI) charted a new course for the professional scientific society toward more use-inspired science. The SBI connected the dots between seemingly esoteric research topics and real-world environmental problems. Lubchenco co-founded a research/monitoring/communications collaboration that sought to understand how the near-shore portion of the large marine ecosystem off the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California works and is changing, with an eye to improving management and policy. This collaboration across four universities (Oregon State University, University of California at Santa Cruz, Stanford University, University of California at Santa Barbara), called the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) provided a new model for conducting ecosystem-wide research in which each university would conduct the same basic monitoring and research for its portion of the shoreline, allowing greater comparability and power across the entire system. Findings from the PISCO team have been used by managers and policy makers, e.g., to understand the emergence of new dead zones off Washington and Oregon, and to inform selection criteria for networks of marine reserves and Marine Protected Areas in California and Oregon. Marine reserves and marine protected areas Lubchenco led an influential study of the science of marine reserves (also called 'no-take' marine protected areas) ‚Äì areas of the ocean protected from any extractive or destructive activities. The study showed that reserves result in significant increases in abundance, size and diversity of species within the reserve, and that some of this bounty spills over to the area outside the reserve. This study also proposed the concept of 'networks' of reserves ‚Äì reserves within a large marine ecosystem that are connected by the movement of juveniles or adults. She famously proposed the '20% by 2020' phrase ‚Äì that 20% of the world's oceans be protected in marine reserves by the year 2020 to draw attention to the urgent need to protect and restore oceans to health. This proposal and other efforts to promote marine reserves have been controversial and resisted by those who wish to keep extracting resources from oceans. More recently, where fishermen have exclusive rights to fish along the margins of marine reserves, and thus benefit from the bounty spilling out from the reserve, they have championed establishment of more reserves.  NOAA = Appointment  Lubchenco served as Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) from 2009 to 2013. She was nominated by President-Elect Barack Obama as a part of his new \\"Science Team\\" in December 2008, confirmed by the Senate on March 19, 2009, and sworn in on March 20, 2009. To introduce her to his Senate colleagues for her confirmation hearing, Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) called Lubchenco 'the bionic woman of good science.'. She served as Administrator for nearly four years until her resignation on February 27, 2013. NOAA is the nation's top science agency for climate, weather, and oceans. As head of NOAA, Lubchenco oversaw a staff of 12,800 employees, a budget of ca $5 billion, and ensured NOAA carried out its mission \\"To understand and predict changes in climate, weather, oceans, and coasts, to share that knowledge and information with others, and to conserve and manage coastal and marine ecosystems and resources.\\". Lubchenco is both the first woman and the first marine ecologist to occupy the post. During her tenure at NOAA, she helped guide the nation through disasters such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and some of the most severe weather on record. She also oversaw the formulation of NOAA's first scientific integrity policy, the implementation of Congress' instructions to end overfishing in U.S. waters by having management plans for every fishery, the restructuring of the program responsible for building the next generation of weather satellites, and assisted with the creation of the first National Ocean Policy for the United States.  Strengthening science  NOAA's ability to provide services and stewardship depends on having credible scientific information and good scientists. Lubchenco helped to strengthen science in the agency in a number of ways. First, the position of Chief Scientist, previously vacant for 16 years, was reinstated, although the Senate did not act to confirm the President's nominee at this time. Second, NOAA doubled the number of senior scientist positions, and created a scientific Council of Fellows. Third, under her leadership, NOAA created its first Scientific Integrity Policy. The Scientific Integrity Policy allows NOAA scientists to speak freely to the media and public, and forbids the manipulation, suppression, distortion and misuse of science in the agency. Early in President Obama's administration, he charged agencies with establishing strong scientific integrity policies that would 'return science to its rightful place' in government. NOAA's Scientific Integrity Policy has been called the \\"Platinum Standard\\" for agency policies in protecting the rights of scientists to communicate freely and in ensuring policy makers will not suppress or modify scientific findings. In addition, a first-ever all-agency-scientist workshop was held to identify scientific priorities and ways to strengthen science at the agency. This workshop helped form the foundation of NOAA's Next Generation Strategic Plan, which assesses the highest priority opportunities for NOAA to contribute to the advancement of society.  Deepwater Horizon oil spill  On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig off the coast of Louisiana unexpectedly exploded, causing oil to freely flow into the Gulf of Mexico for the next 87 days. NOAA was one of the lead agencies responsible for responding to the oil spill. Lubchenco led NOAA's response and coordination with 13 other agencies. NOAA provided data from satellites, planes, ships and buoys, and on-the-ground scientists to help track the oil and forecast where it would go; local weather forecasts to inform responders; scientific advice to the U.S. Coast Guard who is in charge of an oil spill in U.S. waters; kept seafood safe by closing fisheries in U.S. waters when oil was present or expected to be present; developed protocols with other agencies to reopen closed areas; protected endangered species such as turtles; and evaluated the impact of the spill on the natural resources of the Gulf and the public's access to them. Lubchenco was frequently interviewed by the media as a federal science expert, and helped disseminate the working knowledge of the response to the public. NOAA scientists and their academic partners continue to analyze and monitor the effects of the spill on the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem  Oceans and coasts  Lubchenco helped craft the United States' National Ocean Policy, a document that provides a science-based blueprint for managing the U.S.'s oceans, coasts and Great Lakes to help mitigate conflicts between different ocean users (fishermen, shippers, natural resource managers, etc.) and ensure an overarching focus on good stewardship. She actively participated in the President's Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force and attended all of the six regional meetings across the country to gather stakeholder input. Recommendations of this Task Force were adopted by President Obama as the nation's first formal policy on oceans on July 19, 2010. While environmental groups, federal and state lawmakers, and federal agency officials applauded the policy, some lawmakers and members of industry felt that it would provide too much regulation. Despite some opposition, on April 16, 2013, the Obama administration laid out an implementation plan for the National Ocean Policy to put into practice the recommendations laid out in the policy. Fisheries In 2006, Congress re-authorized the Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA), the regulatory law for the U.S. fisheries in federal waters. Sustainable fisheries are critical for ensuring sustainable coastal economies and livelihoods. Under the MSA, NOAA was directed to end overfishing by 2010 by having a management plan for each federally managed fishery. Lubchenco led NOAA's efforts to develop MSA management plans, which specify annual catch limits and accountability measures for each fishery. As of July 2011, in collaboration with the Fishery Management Councils in each region, NOAA completed this task. Lubchenco's support for limiting fishing in coastal communities led to some Congressmen calling for her resignation.[14, 16] Creating catch limits is often controversial, but thanks to these plans and their enforcement, overfishing is ending in U.S. waters and many depleted fisheries are recovering. According to NOAA, 2012 had the lowest number of stocks on the overfishing list and 32 stocks have been rebuilt since 2000, most within the last few years, creating more sustainable fishing opportunities and healthy ecosystems. In an email to NOAA employees, Lubchenco listed \\"ending over-fishing, rebuilding depleted stocks, and returning fishing to profitability\\" as a major accomplishment of NOAA during her tenure.\\" Under Lubchenco's leadership, NOAA also pursued use of 'catch shares' as a viable fishery management tool for appropriate fisheries. Although catch shares have been used since 1990 in the U.S., scientific evidence about their merits suggests that the wider use of catch shares may benefit many other fisheries, making them once again profitable and sustainable. Science magazine quoted Lubchenco on catch shares, saying: > Recent scientific analyses show us that fisheries managed with catch share > programs perform better than fisheries managed with traditional tools. Even > in the first years after implementation, catch share fisheries are stable, > and even increase their productivity ... I see catch shares as the best way > for many fisheries to both meet the Magnuson mandates and have healthy, > profitable fisheries that are sustainable. In 2010, after extensive consultation with regional fishery management councils, NOAA adopted its National Catch Share Policy, which encourages the use of catch shares where appropriate. Although critics asserted that NOAA imposed catch shares on fisheries, the policy makes it clear that they are not required, nor are they appropriate for every fishery. NOAA's Catch Share Policy remains controversial, with critics asserting it cuts jobs for fishermen and takes away money from small coastal economies. However, many coastal economies are beginning to embrace this type of fisheries management and, with the help of NOAA, are implementing a catch share-based system. During the four years Lubchenco was at NOAA, the number of catch share programs grew from 5 to 15. In most of those programs, profitability is up, innovation by fishermen has increased and discards are down. During Lubchenco's tenure, NOAA's law enforcement program came under fire. After hearing from fishermen and members of Congress about problems, she requested a review of the program from the Department of Commerce Inspector General. The problems identified by the review were addressed when Lubchenco initiated a top-to-bottom overhaul of the program, including improvements to policy for assessing penalties, limited use of civil funds, updates to its National and Division Enforcement Priorities with stakeholder input, and a plan to create enforcement positions that better ensure compliance. As these changes were being implemented, additional past problems came to light15, triggering additional reforms. Lubchenco also pushed for greater attention to recreational fishing. She created a new position at NOAA to oversee and represent saltwater fishing interests, called for a Saltwater Recreational Fishing Summit, met with recreational fishing groups frequently, and increased data collection about recreational fisheries to provide a better basis for management. Despite significant progress, many recreational fishing organizations continue to express distrust and unhappiness with Lubchenco in particular and NOAA in general. On the international front, Lubchenco increased the number of efforts aimed at addressing overfishing and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing on the high seas. She teamed up with the Commissioner of Fisheries for the European Union, Maria Damanaki to initiate a more serious effort to address illegal fishing and level the playing field for law-abiding fishermen. Lubchenco worked to see international treaties on IUU fishing approved and strengthened the use of science and precaution in making decisions by regional fishery management organizations.  Climate services  Providing data, services and products related to forecasting a changing climate is a main priority for NOAA scientists. Lubchenco strengthened these efforts. One of her initial goals was to establish the National Climate Service, which would have re-organized NOAA to better provide climate services and products to the public13. However, congressional opposition prevented the budget-neutral re-organization from moving forward. Nonetheless, responding to increasing demands for climate services, under Lubchenco's leadership, NOAA initiated a number of steps. Climate.gov was created in 2012 as a \\"one-stop shop\\" for climate information. In 2011 NOAA signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Western Governors' Association to provide western states with a range of climate services, for example information about impending drought. She said, \\"Creating a new generation of climate services to promote public understanding, support mitigation and adaptation efforts, enable smart planning, and promote regional climate partnerships\\" were some of the things she was most proud of during her tenure. During her time, NOAA also led federal agency efforts to develop the most ambitious National Climate Assessment ever conducted. Weather-Ready Nation From 2009-2013, the nation experienced some of the most extreme weather on record. NOAA delivered life-saving forecasts for 770 tornadoes, 70 Atlantic hurricanes/tropical storms, 6 major floods, 3 tsunamis, historic drought, prolonged heat waves, record snowfall/blizzard. Dr. Lubchenco has said that \\"bizarre, crazy weather\\" came to define her term as NOAA Administrator. In 2011, NOAA's National Weather Service, the source of all official weather warnings and the main weather forecasting body in the country, decided it could no longer gauge its performance by the accuracy and timeliness of its forecast ‚Äì it needed to also understand how effective these were at getting people to respond. Under the lead of Dr. Lubchenco, NOAA launched the \\"Weather-Ready Nation\\" initiative in the summer of 2011 to help build resilience and improve on-the-ground response to extreme weather and water events. In March 2011, NOAA initiated the nation's most ambitious upgrading of its weather radar network, converting all of its 160 radar sites to dual polarization technology, which vastly improves the accuracy and timeliness of forecasts related to weather and water activity. Hurricane Sandy In late October 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit the east coast of the United States, devastating communities across the eastern seaboard and west to Michigan and Wisconsin. NOAA technology and scientists helped to accurately predict the path of the storm, allowing on-the-ground warnings to be issued in time to save lives. Toh≈çku earthquake On March 11, 2011, the large Tohoku earthquake occurred off the coast of Japan, which was the precursor to the devastating Fukushima earthquake one month later. NOAA was involved in predicting where radioactive material and marine debris would go, how the currents would carry the material, and helping coastal states and communities prepare for dealing with the debris when it arrived.

These papers report novel findings about the factors determining local and global patterns of distribution, abundance and diversity of species on rocky sea shores, interactions between people and nature, the importance of no-take marine protected areas and the responsibilities of scientists to society. The eight classic papers are:   Most of Lubchenco's earlier research concentrated on local ecological patterns of rocky sea shores and their causes; her later research looks at ocean ecosystems more broadly ‚Äì how they work, how they are changing and implications for policy and management. She has shifted her focus to conducting research that informs sustainable use of oceans and has worked on a range of interrelated topics including aquaculture, fisheries, climate change, biodiversity, ecosystem services, dead zones (hypoxia and anoxia), ecosystem approaches to management and marine reserves.

Milbank Professor of Geosciences and International Affairs in the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, the Department of Geosciences, and the Princeton Environmental Institute at Princeton University. He is the Director of the Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment (C-PREE) at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs and Faculty Associate of the Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences Program and the Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies. Oppenheimer has played a leading role at the interface of science and public policy including influencing the development of the acid rain provisions of the US Clean Air Act. He co- organized a series of activities that prefigured the emergence of climate change as a top international concern and influenced the development of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. He directed climate and air pollution activities at the Environmental Defense Fund when that NGO‚Äôs science-based and incentive-based approach to climate change was reflected in the language of the Kyoto Protocol. Oppenheimer has played a significant role within the Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), serving as Contributing Author, Lead Author, or Coordinating Lead Author on each assessment report since IPCC‚Äôs first report, as well as two special reports. Oppenheimer also serves as a Review Editor on the Sixth Assessment Report. Oppenheimer is a prominent public figure and has discussed various aspects of the impacts of and solutions to climate change and other issues in the media. He has testified before committees of the US Senate and House of Representatives on numerous occasions. He has also been a guest on many television and radio programs and talk shows, including This Week, The News Hour, The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Colbert Report, and 60 Minutes. Oppenheimer is the author of over 200 articles published in professional journals. He is the author of Discerning Experts: The Practices of Scientific Assessment for Environmental Policy published in 2019 with several coauthors and Dead Heat: The Race Against The Greenhouse Effect, coauthored with Robert H. Boyle and published in 1990. Oppenheimer is co-founder of the Climate Action Network and has served on many expert panels including the New York City Panel on Climate Change and the US National Academies‚Äô Board on Energy and Environmental Systems. He is a trustee of the NGOs Climate Central and Climate Science Legal Defense Fund. Oppenheimer also serves as co-editor-in- chief of the journal Climatic Change.  Background  Oppenheimer (born February 28, 1946, New York City) joined the Princeton faculty after more than two decades with the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), a non-governmental, environmental organization, where he served as chief scientist and manager of the Climate and Air Program. Prior to his position at the Environmental Defense Fund, Dr. Oppenheimer served as Atomic and Molecular Astrophysicist at the Harvard‚ÄìSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics and Lecturer on Astronomy at Harvard University. He received an S.B. in chemistry from M.I.T., a Ph.D. in chemical physics from the University of Chicago, and pursued post-doctoral research at the Harvard‚ÄìSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics. He continues to serve as a science advisor to EDF. Oppenheimer won the 2010 Heinz Award in the Environment and is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Research interests  His interests include science and policy of the atmosphere, particularly climate change and its impacts. Much of his research aims to understand the potential for \\"dangerous\\" outcomes of increasing levels of greenhouse gases by exploring the effects of global warming on ice sheets and sea level, and on patterns of human migration. He has assessed linkages among climate change, crop yields and Mexico‚ÄìUS cross- border migration. Oppenheimer studies the process of scientific learning and scientific assessments and their role in influencing public policies to respond to global change.  Role in global science policy  Oppenheimer is a long-time participant in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, serving recently as a Coordinating Lead Author of the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate. In the late 1980s, Dr. Oppenheimer and a handful of other scientists organized two workshops under the auspices of the United Nations that helped precipitate the negotiations that resulted in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (signed at the 1992 Earth Summit) and the Kyoto Protocol. During that period, he co-founded the Climate Action Network. His research and advocacy work on acid rain also contributed to the passage of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act and influenced the development of the Kyoto Protocol.  Assessment of the IPCC process  In 2007, he wrote about limitations of the IPCC consensus approach in Science Magazine. The current centralized assessment role of the IPCC allows for \\"communication in a monolithic message\\" but risks \\"ossification and eventual irrelevance\\" of the IPCC as an institution. According to him, the \\"problem of creating, defending, and communicating consensus, as well as departures from the consensus\\" had been discussed but not addressed until after the AR4. Oppenheimer notes important changes within the IPCC, including a stronger focus on uncertainty and risk management after publication of the InterAcademy Panel IAC 2010 IPCC review. Together with Jessica O'Reilly and Naomi Oreskes, Oppenheimer discussed the way the risk of collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was assessed in IPCC reports in a Social Studies of Science paper in 2012. The authors cited the changes of IPCC chairpersons, authors teams, and chapter organization as reasons for an incomplete assessment of the ice sheet and resulting confusion among stakeholders. Oppenheimer and coauthors pursued the theme of treatment of uncertainty in assessments in subsequent papers, particularly Climate change prediction: erring on the side of least drama?

Tr√ºbner 1882 pp. 219-223 Andrew Lang included it in The Grey Fairy Book under the title The Magician's Horse.Andrew Lang, The Grey Fairy Book, \\"The Magician's Horse\\" Synopsis A king's three sons went hunting, and the youngest got lost. He came to a great hall and ate there. Then he found an old man, who asked him who he was. He told how he had become lost and offered to enter his service. The old man set him to keep the stove lit, to fetch the firewood from the forest, and to take care of the black horse in the stables. The man was a magician, and the fire was the source of his power, though he did not tell the prince. One day, the prince nearly let the fire go out, and the old man stormed in. Frightened, the prince threw another log on it and nursed it back. The horse told him to saddle and bridle it, to use an ointment that made his hair like gold, and to pile all the wood he could on the fire. This set the hall on fire. The horse then told him to take looking-glass, a brush and a riding-whip, and ride off on him. The magician chased on a roan horse, but the prince threw down the looking glass, the horse cut its feet on it, and the magician had to go back to put new shoes on him, but then he chased the prince again. The horse had the prince throw the brush on the ground. This produced a thick wood, and the magician had to go back and get an axe to cut through it, but then he chased the prince again. The prince threw down the whip; it became a river, and when the magician tried to cross it, it put out his magical fire and killed him. The horse told the prince to strike the ground with a willow wand. A door opened, making a hall in which the horse stayed, but he sent the prince through the fields to take service with a king. He wore a scarf to hide his golden hair. He worked as a gardener and every day brought half his food to the horse. One day, the horse told him that the king's three daughters would choose their husbands: a great company of lords would gather, and they would throw their diamond apples into the air. The man at whose feet the apple stopped would be the bridegroom. He should be in the garden, nearby, and the youngest's would roll to him; he should take it up at once. He did. The scarf slipped a little, the princess saw his hair and fell in love at once, and the king, though reluctant, let them marry. Soon after, the king had to go to war. He gave the prince a broken-down nag. The prince went to the black horse; it gave him arms and armor, and he rode it to battle and won the battle, but fled before he could be clearly seen. Twice more, he went to war, but the third time, he was wounded, and the king bound his wound with his own handkerchief. The princess his wife recognized it and revealed it to her father. There was great rejoicing, and the king gave him half his kingdom. Variants on motifs This particular type of tale is well known, being particularly found in Germany, Scandanvia, and the Baltic, but also throughout Europe, and appears in Asia down to Indonesia and also in Africa. Stith Thompson, The Folktale, p 59-60, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977 Other tales like this include Little Johnny Sheep-Dung and The Gifts of the Magician. A less common variant, found only in Europe, opens with the hero rescuing a wild man, as in Iron John, Guerrino and the Savage Man, and The Hairy Man.Stith Thompson, The Folktale, p 60-1, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977 The motifs are found in many more tales. While getting a horse is a frequent quest object, it is usually the side effect of needing it for something else, as in The Death of Koschei the Deathless or The Nine Peahens and the Golden Apples. It is generally a gift of the donor, as in FƒÉt- Frumos with the Golden Hair. When the hero is working for the villain, the usual aid comes from a woman who is the heroine -- The Battle of the Birds, The White Dove, or The Master Maid -- and therefore does not end as this one does, with an additional adventure to gain a bride, as in The Hairy Man.

He served as the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under President Bill Clinton from 1993-1998.  Education  Jack Gibbons received two bachelor's degrees, one in mathematics and the other in chemistry from Randolph-Macon College in 1949, and a doctorate in nuclear physics from Duke University in 1954.  Career  Following his formal training in physics, Dr. Gibbons spent 15 years at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. At Oak Ridge, he studied the structure of atomic nuclei, with emphasis on the role of neutron capture in the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in stars. In the late 1960s, at the urging of Alvin M. Weinberg, he pioneered studies on how to use technology to conserve energy and minimize the environmental impacts of energy production and consumption. In 1973, Dr. Gibbons was appointed the first Director of the U.S. Federal Office of Energy Conservation. In 1975 he returned to Tennessee to direct the University of Tennessee Energy, Environment and Resources Center. Dr, Gibbons was appointed In 1979 to direct the US Congressional Office of Technology Assessment,. which provided the Congress with nonpartisan, comprehensive analyses on a broad spectrum of issues involving technology and public policy. His tenure at OTA lasted over two six-year terms, until 1992. President Bill Clinton appointed Gibbons to serve as the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy; his tenure there lasted from February 2, 1993 to April 15, 1998. As the President's Science Advisor, he co-chaired the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) and was a member of the Domestic Policy Council, the National Economic Council, the National Security Council, and the National Science and Technology Council, which coordinated science and technology policy and budgets across the federal government. After leaving the White House, Dr. Gibbons served as the Karl T. Compton Lecturer at MIT (1998‚Äì1999) and Senior Fellow at the National Academy of Engineering (1999‚Äì2000) where he assisted NAE's president on a variety of topics including the new NAE program in Earth Systems Engineering. During 1999-2001 he was Senior Advisor to the U.S. Department of State where he assisted the Secretary in revitalizing science and technology capabilities, including creating the position of Science Advisor to the Secretary.  Scientific affiliations and awards  Between 1994 and 1997 he earned five honorary doctorates from the Illinois Institute of Technology, Mt. Sinai Medical School, the University of Delaware, Duke University, and the University of Maryland. Dr. Gibbons was a fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and was elected to membership in the National Academy of Engineering. He was a member of the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the AAAS Philip Hauge Abelson Prize for sustained exceptional contributions to advancing science; the Leo Szilard Award for Physics in the Public Interest from the American Physical Society; and medals from the German and French governments for fostering scientific cooperation. Gibbons has over 50 publications on energy and environmental policy. From 2000-2001 he was the elected President of Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society. In 2004 he became one of the founding members and served on the Board of Directors of Scientists and Engineers for America, a 501(c)(3) organization focused on promoting sound science in American government. He was also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Federation of American Scientists. In 2005 he was awarded the US Civilian Research and Development Foundation (CRDF) George Brown Award for International Science and Technology Collaboration, CRDF's highest award, established to honor the late Rep. George Brown, Jr.  Tributes  Former Senator and Vice President Al Gore issued a statement on July 29, 2015 eulogizing Dr. Gibbons, which reads, in part: \\"I am deeply saddened by the news that my good friend, former colleague and fellow Tennessean, Jack Gibbons, recently passed away. I first worked with Jack while serving in the House of Representatives after he had left the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to take the helm of the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment during an increasingly complex scientific and technological age. I, later, had the privilege of working even more closely with him after his appointment to serve as the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology at the beginning of the new administration in January 1993. Jack had a rare and uncanny ability to look at critical large-scale issues affecting our planet through scientific, technological, social and ethical lenses and present a definitive overview to help policy makers better address such issues and better anticipate future problems. It was Jack's optimism and imagination that did so much to help the United States face the difficult issues of our time, including the climate crisis. He was utterly unique and irreplaceable.\\"  Personal and family life  Gibbons was born in Harrisonburg, Virginia, in 1929. As a teenager he became an Eagle Scout and earned the Order of the Arrow. Gibbons married Mary Ann Hobart in 1955; together they had three children: Virginia Neil, Diana Conrad, and Mary Marshall. For many years until shortly before his death, he and his wife resided in The Plains, Virginia. He is preceded in death by a brother, William Conrad Gibbons (1926-2015), an American historian noted for his in-depth chronicling of the Vietnam War. Gibbons died after a stroke at Crozet, Virginia in 2015. ReferencesExternal links Dr. John H. Gibbons Home Page *Dr. John H. Gibbons Curriculum Vita *Dr. John H.

It was based on a much smaller version of the same scene, presently held by the Yale University Art Gallery. Trumbull painted many of the figures in the picture from life, and visited Independence Hall to depict the chamber where the Second Continental Congress met. The oil-on- canvas work was commissioned in 1817, purchased in 1819, and placed in the United States Capitol rotunda in 1826. The painting is sometimes incorrectly described as the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The painting shows the five-man drafting committee presenting their draft of the Declaration to the Congress, an event that took place on June 28, 1776, and not the signing of the document, which took place later.John Hazelton, \\"The Historical Value of Trumbull's - 'Declaration of Independence' \\", The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography - Volume 31, (Historical Society of Pennsylvania, 1907), 38. The painting shows 42 of the 56 signers of the Declaration; Trumbull originally intended to include all 56 signers but was unable to obtain likenesses for all of them. He also depicted several participants in the debate who did not sign the document, including John Dickinson, who declined to sign. Trumbull had no portrait of Benjamin Harrison V to work with, but his son Benjamin Harrison VI was said to resemble his father, so Trumbull painted him instead. Similarly, Trumbull painted Rufus Hopkins, who resembled his father Stephen Hopkins, for whom no portrait was available. As the Declaration was debated and signed over a period of time when membership in Congress changed, the men featured in the painting never were in the same room at the same time. In the painting, Thomas Jefferson appears to be stepping on John Adams' foot, which many thought was supposed to symbolize their relationship as friendly rivals. However, upon closer examination of the painting, it can be seen that their feet are merely close together. This part of the image was correctly depicted on the two-dollar bill version. Three British ensigns and a single English ensign can be seen hanging on the farthest wall in the painting, though this is not depicted in all versions, most notably the one seen on the two-dollar bill.

It was first used on the reverse side of the $100 National Bank Note that was issued in 1863. The depiction was engraved by Frederick Girsch of the American Bank Note Company. The same steel engraving was used on the 24¬¢ stamp issued six years later as part of the 1869 pictorial series of definitive U.S. postage stamps. Trumbull's painting is presently depicted on the reverse of the two-dollar bill. Featured in it are 40 of the 47 figures from Trumbull's painting. Cut out from the scene are: the farthest four figures on the left‚ÄîGeorge Wythe, William Whipple, Josiah Bartlett, and Thomas Lynch, Jr.; the farthest two figures on the right‚ÄîThomas McKean and Philip Livingston; and one of three figures seated in the left rear‚ÄîGeorge Walton. Additionally, two unrecognized figures were added: one in between Samuel Chase and Lewis Morris and another between James Wilson and Francis Hopkinson, bringing the total number of figures shown in this presentation scene to 42. Other versions The Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776, John Trumbull, (1786‚Äì1820), Yale University Art Gallery Trumbull painted a smaller version (only ) entitled The Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776 (1786‚Äì1820) that is now on view at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut. Legacy and interpretations In 2017, the company Ancestry.com restaged the painting with the 29 living descendants of the men depicted in Trumbull's painting as part of an advertising campaign called ‚ÄúDeclaration Descendants\\". The campaign included two short films and ran on digital and social media platforms. Shannon Lanier, the sixth great-grandson of Thomas Jefferson, said: ‚ÄúWhen you see the new picture, the new image, it‚Äôs a picture of diverse people. Black, white, Hispanic, Native American‚Äîa little bit of everything‚ÄîAsian, and that‚Äôs more of a representation of this country\\". In September 2019 Arlen Parsa, a filmmaker from Chicago, published an image of the painting with red dots covering the faces of those that enslaved people to his twitter account.Parsa, Arlen [@arlenparsa] (1 September 2019). \\"This is one of the most famous paintings in American history: Declaration of Independence. I decided to put red dots on all the men who held slaves.Next time someone puts them on a pedestal and says we can't question their judgement on guns or whatever, show them this image.\\" (Tweet). Archived from the original on 6 July 2020. Parsa's research identified 34 of the 47 men depicted as slave holders, this was fact-checked by PolitiFact who rated the statement as \\"true\\". PolitiFact stated \\"We found strong evidence to back the claim on the 34, recognizing there is no one definitive source on the question.\\" The 34 men depicted who were enslavers are: See also *Congress Voting Independence, a similar painting by Robert Edge Pine, 1784-1788 *Declaration of Independence Tablet, Boston Common *Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States - a 1940 painting depicting members of the 1787 Constitutional Convention by Howard Chandler Christy. * Syng inkstand, pictured in the painting NotesReferencesExternal links ;Keys to the figures *Another key to the figures *Declaration of Independence Flash - based key ;Other *A web page with some information on the painting *Architect of the Capitol Web page on the painting American paintings Paintings about the American Revolution Paintings by John Trumbull 1810s paintings United States Declaration of Independence Paintings in the United States Capitol Musical instruments in art Books in art Flags in art Cultural depictions of John Adams Cultural depictions of Benjamin Franklin Cultural depictions of Thomas Jefferson Cultural depictions of Samuel Adams ","title":"Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)"},{"id":"6339618","text":"Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology (NMIT) is an autonomous engineering college in Bangalore, Karnataka, India affiliated to the Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belagavi.

Troilus (AKA-46) was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1907) on 18 March 1945 at Providence, R.I., by the Walsh- Kaiser Co., Inc.; launched on 11 May 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Arthur G. B. Metcalf; acquired by the Navy and commissioned on 8 June 1945, Lt. Comdr. Nathan McKenzie, USNR, in command. Service history Following shakedown training in the Chesapeake Bay, Troilus departed Norfolk on 11 July and steamed independently via the Canal Zone to Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 1 August, disembarked passengers, fueled, and again got underway. Until 15 August, when the surrender of Japan was announced, she conducted intensive amphibious exercises in Maalaea Bay, Maui, operating with units of Transport Squadron 22. With news of the war's end, she returned to Pearl Harbor and began loading ammunition, equipment, gasoline, trucks, trailers, and even airplanes for the occupation of Japan. On 7 September, Troilus departed the Hawaiian Islands and proceeded via the Marianas to Japan. She anchored in Wakayama harbor on the morning of 27 September and had all her boats in the water in less than 40 minutes. Despite continuous heavy rainfall and a rough eight-to-ten-foot surf which tossed two LCVP's high on the beach beyond retraction, Troilus unloaded cargo throughout the day. On the 29th, she disembarked over 200 troops from the 98th Division's 368th Field Artillery. After the successful completion of her mission, Troilus departed Wakayama on 1 October, bound for the Philippines. Early in October, she stopped at Subic Bay and at Manila Bay before anchoring in Lingayen Gulf on the 12th to take on additional passengers and cargo for the occupation of Japan. She discharged troops at Wakayama harbor on the 25th, then continued on to anchor at Nagoya on the 27th. Early in November, she began \\"Magic Carpet\\" duties transporting American troops back to the United States. She embarked 485 passengers at Buckner Bay on 11 November; then set her course for California the following day. Troilus arrived at San Francisco on the morning of 29 November and lost no time in disembarking her homeward-bound passengers. Following repairs at Graham Shipyard, Oakland, the attack cargo ship got underway for Japan on 24 December 1945, but en route received orders diverting her to Hawaii. Troilus put in at Pearl Harbor on 16 January and, on the 23d, set her course for California. She discharged passengers and mail at San Pedro on 30 January and then returned to San Francisco to take on a capacity load of landing craft for transportation to the East Coast. She departed that port on the 12th and steamed via the Panama Canal and Norfolk to New York. During March, crews removed equipment and gear from the vessel in preparation for her disposition. On 11 April, Troilus made her last voyage under her own power, steaming up the Hudson River to moor at the Eureka Shipyard, Newburgh, New York, to remove remaining materials and to undergo preservation procedures. Her decommissioning took place minutes before noon on 14 June 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 8 July 1946, and she was delivered to the War Shipping Administration on 28 August 1946. She was laid up by that agency until 17 April 1967 when she was sold to the Union Metals and Alloy Corporation, of New York City, and scrapped.

The Blackball Branch was a branch line railway of New Zealand's national rail network on the West Coast of the South Island and worked from the 1900s to 1966. It included the Roa Branch, also known as the Roa Incline. Roa was sometimes known as Paparoa.  Construction  Locomotive on the railway line between Blackball and Roa, circa 1940s-1950s, showing the centre rail. The Press (Newspaper) :Negatives. Ref: 1/1-009750-G. Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington. The Blackball Coal Company's mine near Blackball was on the opposite side of the Grey River to the Stillwater - Westport Line, and in the late 19th century an aerial cableway was used to transport coal from the mine across the river to a railway station in Ngahere. This did not prove to be as efficient or desirable as a railway, so in 1901 a branch line across the Grey River from Ngahere to Blackball was approved. The Public Works Department began building the 5.5-km line in 1902, but it was plagued with difficulties. Construction of the Grey River bridge suffered from delays, a contractor for a trestle bridge further along the line went bankrupt, and torrential rain made working conditions hard and problematic. As construction slowly progressed, work on an incline from Blackball into the Paparoa Ranges was commenced by the Paparoa Coal Company. This line was ultimately taken over by the State Mines Department and involved a Fell centre rail for braking due to grades as steep as 1 in 25. This was not a full incline like its North Island counterpart, the Rimutaka Incline. During 1909, the Public Works Department began carrying coal along the Blackball Branch, and in September that year, the State Mines Department began operating the Roa Incline. The Blackball Branch was not handed over to the New Zealand Railways Department and officially opened until 1 August 1910. The Roa Incline was owned by the State Mines Department for its entire life.  Operation  Coal production from the mines increased greatly when the railway opened, as it permitted much larger quantities of coal to be carried. Workings on the Roa Incline were spectacular; sometimes up to eight trains a day would run down the Incline, relying only on handbrakes to avoid a runaway. Passenger services were operated to Blackball for a number of years, primarily for the mine workers, and these ceased in 1940. Before 1955 the engine depot in Blackball closed and trains operated from Greymouth, and in 1955 Blackball station burned down. Trains to Blackball were typically operated by B and WF class steam locomotives, with W and WA locomotives on the Roa Incline. Diesel locomotives were never used on the Blackball Branch. A significant impediment to the operation of the line was the difficulty and cost of maintaining the 1680 foot length road-rail bridge across the Grey River. Poor design and construction meant that the bridge was frequently damaged by flooding, requiring expensive repairs. This situation eventually led to the closure of the line when the cost of maintenance became too high. The hazards of working such a steep incline without a continuous air brake were an important safety issue, leading to occasional runaways, although it is unclear whether any injury resulted from such situations. Falling production and a decrease in orders meant that the State Mines Department closed the Roa Incline on 25 July 1960. From July 1963, only one train was permitted to operate on the Blackball Branch at a time, though due to the low quantity of traffic it is doubtful this policy ever had to be seriously enforced. By 1964, the line served just one active mine, operating on a limited basis. The Railways Department began to consider closure of the line, and when a flood on 21 February 1966 destroyed two spans of the Grey River bridge it was decided that repairs would not be economic and the line was closed.  The branch today  Four spans of the old railway bridge over in the Grey River stood until 2002 when they were dismantled. The bridge itself was kept in operation until 1968 as a road only bridge, and then several more years for pedestrians, until further flooding damage made it impractical to repair. Nearby, two towers of the cableway that preceded the railway can be seen amidst swampland near Ngahere. Another bridge remains in place across Ford Creek on the Roa Incline, still complete with pedestals for the centre rail. In the rugged terrain, some of the formation of the Blackball and Roa lines can be seen, though it is often not near roads and nature is steadily reclaiming the line. Few other remnants of the line exist.

Scribing a pencil line to fit two pieces of wood together. Coping or scribing is the woodworking technique of shaping the end of a moulding or frame component to neatly fit the contours of an abutting member. Joining tubular members in metalworking is also referred to as a cope, or sometimes a \\"fish mouth joint\\" or saddle joint. Most English-speaking countries outside the United States use the terms scribe and scribing. Coping is commonly used in the fitting of skirting and other mouldings in a room. It allows for clean joints between intersecting members when walls are not square to each other. The other method of fitting these mouldings that is commonly used is the mitre joint, but this technique relies upon knowing the precise angle between the walls for neat results. Coping is only ever used for internal corners. External corners are always mitred. The main reason that scribed joints are used is that timber shrinks in width far more than it does in length. By using a scribed joint rather than an internal mitre joint, the effect of shrinkage is minimised. Also it is possible to arrange the scribed joints pointing away from the most common viewpoint (usually the doorway of a room) and so present the best appearance. Coping is also commonly used in cabinet making for mouldings and frame components. The rails in frame and panel construction are commonly cope cut to fit the profile of the stiles. The technique is also common in the construction of doors and windows. Scribe joinery is also commonly used in the building of log homes. The shape of the log underneath is scribed into the bottom of a log to be placed on top. This provides a tight seal between the two adjacent logs. It is also commonly used in the building of boats since there is rarely a straight edge but frequently many curves. Traditionally, coping would be performed using a coping saw. There are also mechanical means of producing coped joints, including matching rail and stile cutters for the router as used in frame and panel construction.

Franzen holds up Charlie Brown from the Peanuts cartoons as an exemplary representation of life of the American middle class in the author's home town of Webster Groves, Missouri, and countless similar towns. Values such as the love of nature are described as being related to traditional Protestant values, and as waning because of the decline of traditional religious belief.\\"C¬¥era una volta il Midwest\\", L¬¥Espresso, August 24, 2006, p. 120.

She arrived at Marseilles on 7 July and, the following week, got underway for Panama. She reached Cristobal on the 28th. Two days later, Tabora transited the canal and steamed toward the Marshall Islands. She arrived at Eniwetok on 22 August and, the next day, pushed on toward the Philippines. Upon arriving at San Fernando, Leyte, on the last day of August, the ship was assigned to the 5th Fleet. Tabora loaded troops and vehicles of the 33rd Infantry Division and sailed on 20 September for Japan. She arrived at Wakayama, Honsh≈´, on the 25th; unloaded; and, the next day, began the return trip to the Philippines. She transported another load of occupation troops to Matsuyama, Shikoku, in mid- October. On the 24th, Tabora was assigned to \\"Magic Carpet\\" duty, returning veterans to the United States. On the last day of October, she got underway for Buckner Bay; loaded 340 marines; and sailed for San Francisco. Tabora continued shuttling troops from Pacific bases to the United States until early 1946 when she was scheduled for inactivation.

The monastery was built over a Bronze Age grave field (13.-11. BCE) by Prince Vahan Nakhashinogh, of which it gets its namesake, the son of Prince Gagik of Kapan in the early 10th century. The Armenian historian Stepanos Orbelian (c. 1250 ‚Äì 1305) wrote that the prince had taken on a monk's robe and lifestyle to cure himself of demonic possession. In the year 911, Prince Vahan gathered 100 like-minded clerics and built the church of Surb Grigor Lusavorich. It is the oldest among the structures at Vahanavank. The church is a domed hall like building with a main temple and a pair of sacristies. The drum rises on huge steeple rocks. The church has a west and south entrance. Prince Vahan was buried near the door to the church. A spiritual school was opened at the monastery where young boys from Baghk and other provinces studied. Prince Vahan Nakhashinogh's nephew Vahan Jevanshir II, was educated at the monastery and rose to become the Bishop of Syunik around 940 and then Catholicos around the year 960. During his reign he built many great monuments, many of which remain in ruins. The vestibule and portico first half of the 10th century. The latter stretches to the south of the church and the narthex. Kings and princes of Syunik are buried here. The cornices of the vestibule are decorated with vegetal and animal ornamental motives which border the southern and northern walls. Vahanavank became the religious center for the kings of Syunik in the 11th century. In 1086, Queen Shahandukht II of Syunik and her sister Katan built the church of Surb Astvatsatsin as a burial site for her and her relatives. They also constructed the southern entrance to the monastery as well as the vestibule to S. Astvatsatsin. There are other structures, household buildings, khachkars and tombstones that date back to the 10th ‚Äì11th centuries as well.

Scaiano Modern Molecular Photochemistry of Organic Molecules. University Science Books, Sausalito, 2010, . The absorption of ultraviolet light by organic molecules often leads to reactions. In the earliest days, sunlight was employed, while in more modern times ultraviolet lamps are employed. Organic photochemistry has proven to be a very useful synthetic tool. Complex organic products can be obtained simply. History Early examples were often uncovered by the observation of precipitates or color changes from samples that were exposed to sunlights. The first reported case was by Ciamician that sunlight converted santonin to a yellow photoproduct: alt= An early example of a precipitate was the photodimerization of anthracene, characterized by Yulii Fedorovich Fritzsche and confirmed by Elbs. Similar observations focused on the dimerization of cinnamic acid to truxillic acid. Many photodimers are now recognized, e.g. pyrimidine dimer, thiophosgene, diamantane. Another example was uncovered by Egbert Havinga in 1956. The curious result was activation on photolysis by a meta nitro group in contrast to the usual activation by ortho and para groups. center Organic photochemistry advanced with the development of the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. Illustrative, these rules help rationalize the photochemically driven electrocyclic ring-closure of buta-1,3-diene, which proceeds in a disrotatory fashion. center Organic reactions that obey these rules are said to be symmetry allowed. Reactions that take the opposite course are symmetry forbidden and require substantially more energy to take place if they take place at all. Key reactions Organic photochemical reactions are explained in the context of the relevant excited states.\\"The Photochemical Rearrangement of 4,4-Diphenylcyclohexadienone. Paper I on a General Theory of Photochemical Reactions,\\" Zimmerman, H. E.; Schuster, D. I. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1961, 83, 4486-4487. Parallel to the structural studies described above, the role of spin multiplicity - singlet vs triplet - on reactivity was evaluated. The importance of triplet excited species was emphasized. Triplets tend to be longer-lived than singlets and of lower energy than the singlet of the same configuration. Triplets may arise from (A) conversion of the initially formed singlets or by (B) interaction with a higher energy triplet (sensitization). It is possible to quench a triplet reactions.\\"Terenin, A.; Ermolaev, V. Sensitized Phosphorescence in Organic Solutions at Low Temperature; Energy Transfer Between Triplet States\\", Trans. Faraday Soc., 1956, 52, 1042‚Äì1052. Common organic photochemical reactions include: Norrish Type I, the Norrish Type II, the racemization of optically active biphenyls, the type A cyclohexadienone rearrangement, the type B cyclohexenone rearrangement, the di-pi-methane rearrangement, the type B bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanone rearrangement to phenols, photochemical electrocyclic processes, the rearrangement of epoxyketones to beta-diketones, ring opening of cyclopropyl ketones, heterolysis of 3,5-dimethoxylbenzylic derivatives, and photochemical cyclizations of dienes. Practical considerations Photochemical lab reactor with a mercury vapor lamp. Reactants of the photoreactions can be both gaseous and liquids.Mario Schiavello (Hrsg.): Photoelectrochemistry, Photocatalysis and Photoreactors Fundamentals and Developments. Springer Netherlands, 2009, , p. 564. In general, it is necessary to bring the reactants close to the light source in order to obtain the highest possible luminous efficacy. For this purpose, the reaction mixture can be irradiated either directly or in a flow- through side arm of a reactor with a suitable light source.Martin Fischer: Industrial Applications of Photochemical Syntheses. In: Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English. 17, 1978, p. 16‚Äì26, doi:10.1002/anie.197800161. A disadvantage of photochemical processes is the low efficiency of the conversion of electrical energy in the radiation energy of the required wavelength. In addition to the radiation, light sources generate plenty of heat, which in turn requires cooling energy. In addition, most light sources emit polychromatic light, even though only monochromatic light is needed.Dieter W√∂hrle, Michael W. Tausch, Wolf-Dieter Stohrer: Photochemie: Konzepte, Methoden, Experimente. Wiley & Sons, 1998, , p. 271‚Äì275. A high quantum yield, however, compensates for these disadvantages. Working at low temperatures is advantageous since side reactions are avoided (as the selectivity is increased) and the yield is increased (since gaseous reactants are driven out less from the solvent). The starting materials can sometimes be cooled before the reaction to such an extent that the reaction heat is absorbed without further cooling of the mixture. In the case of gaseous or low-boiling starting materials, work under overpressure is necessary. Due to the large number of possible raw materials, a large number of processes have been described. Large scale reactions are usually carried out in a stirred tank reactor, a bubble column reactor or a tube reactor, followed by further processing depending on the target product.David A. Mixon, Michael P. Bohrer, Patricia A. O‚ÄôHara: Ultrapurification of SiCl4 by photochlorination in a bubble column reactor. In: AIChE Journal. 36, 1990, p. 216‚Äì226, doi:10.1002/aic.690360207. In case of a stirred tank reactor, the lamp (generally shaped as an elongated cylinder) is provided with a cooling jacket and placed in the reaction solution. Tube reactors are made from quartz or glass tubes, which are irradiated from the outside. Using a stirred tank reactor has the advantage that no light is lost to the environment. However, the intensity of light drops rapidly with the distance to the light source due to adsorption by the reactants. The influence of the radiation on the reaction rate can often be represented by a power law based on the quantum flow density, i.e. the mole light quantum (previously measured in the unit Einstein) per area and time. One objective in the design of reactors is therefore to determine the economically most favorable dimensioning with regard to an optimization of the quantum current density.H. Hartig: Einfache Dimensionierung, photochemischer Reaktoren. In: Chemie Ingenieur Technik ‚Äì CIT. 42, 1970, p. 1241‚Äì1245, . Case studies=[2+2] Cycloadditions Olefins dimerize upon UV-irradiation. 4,4-Diphenylcyclohexadienone rearrangement Quite parallel to the santonin to lumisantonin example is the rearrangement of 4,4-diphenylcyclohexadienone Here the n-pi* triplet excited state undergoes the same beta-beta bonding. This is followed by intersystem crossing (i.e. ISC) to form the singlet ground state which is seen to be a zwitterion. The final step is the rearrangement to the bicyclic photoproduct. The reaction is termed the type A cyclohexadienone rearrangement. 420px 4,4-diphenylcyclohexenone To provide further evidence on the mechanism of the dienone in which there is bonding between the two double bonds, the case of 4,4-diphenylcyclohexenone is presented here. It is seen that the rearrangement is quite different; thus two double bonds are required for a type A rearrangement. With one double bond one of the phenyl groups, originally at C-4, has migrated to C-3 (i.e. the beta carbon).\\"Mechanistic and Exploratory Organic Photochemistry, IX.

The high volcano lies in the Linares Province, which is part of the Maule Region. It features a summit crater and several parasitic vents. The volcano is constructed principally from lava flows. Two collapses of the edifice have carved collapse scars into the volcano, one on the eastern slope known as Lomas Limpias and another on the southwestern slope known as Los Bueye. The volcano features a glacier and the Achibueno and Blanco rivers originate on the mountain. The oldest volcanic activity occurred one million years ago. After a first phase characterized by the production of basaltic andesite, the bulk of the edifice was constructed by andesitic lava flows. The volcanic rock that makes up Nevado de Longav√≠ features an unusual magma chemistry that resembles adakite (having geochemical characteristics of magma thought to have formed by partial melting of altered basalt that is subducted below volcanic arcs). It may be the consequence of the magma being unusually water-rich, which may occur because the Mocha fracture zone subducts beneath the volcano. Nevado de Longav√≠ was active during the Holocene. 6,835 ¬± 65 or 7,500 years before present an explosive eruption deposited pumice more than away from the volcano. A lava flow was then erupted over the pumice. The last eruption occurred about 5,700 years ago and formed a lava dome. The volcano has no historic eruptions but fumarolic activity is ongoing. Nevado de Longav√≠ is monitored by the National Geology and Mining Service of Chile.  Geography  Nevado de Longav√≠ lies in the Longav√≠ commune of Linares Province, Maule Region.  Regional  Nevado de Longav√≠ seen from Parral, Chile Nevado de Longav√≠ lies in the Andean Mountain Range's Southern Volcanic Zone, which extends between 33 and 46 degrees southern latitude. It is one among 60 volcanoes in Chile and Argentina that lie within the Southern Volcanic Zone. Among the largest volcanic eruptions in this area were the 1932 Quizapu and the 1991 Cerro Hudson eruptions. Nevado de Longav√≠ is usually put into the \\"Transitional Southern Volcanic Zone\\", one of the four segments which the Southern Volcanic Zone is subdivided into; they are characterized by different thicknesses of the crust that the volcanoes are constructed on and by differences in the volcanic rocks. Farther east lie the Tatara-San Pedro and Laguna del Maule volcanoes.  Geology  Volcanism in the Southern Volcanic Zone is caused by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate in the Peru-Chile Trench, at a pace of . The Southern Volcanic Zone is one among several volcanic belts in the Andean Volcanic Belt. Areas without volcanic activity separate it from the Central Volcanic Zone in the north and the Austral Volcanic Zone in the south. These gaps appear to coincide where the Juan Fernandez Ridge and the Chile Rise, respectively, subduct in the Peru-Chile Trench. In the volcanic gaps, the subducting slab seems to be attached to the overriding plate without an asthenosphere in between, suppressing the production of magma. There is a strong northsouth gradient among volcanoes of the Southern Volcanic Zone. The northernmost volcanoes are the highest and lie on thicker crust which causes their magmas to have a stronger crustal contribution. The output of the northernmost volcanoes is dominated by andesitic and more evolved magmas and they have the highest quantity of incompatible elements in their magmas. Southern volcanoes are lower, tend to erupt mafic magmas and are located west of the continental divide. Volcanism in areas of subduction is caused by the release of slab fluids from the subducting slab into the abovelying asthenospheric mantle. The injection of such fluids triggers fluxing and the formation of magmas. Conversely, the descending slab itself is usually not considered a major contributor to magma genesis. Such exceptional magmas are often referred to as adakites, but magmas with such a chemistry can also originate by other processes.

It was formerly considered or high; the accepted elevation is . The volcano has a summit crater and many adventive craters on its slopes. The summit crater is heavily degraded by erosion. Lava flows extend radially away from the summit crater and form the bulk of the volcano. The adventive craters are also associated with lava flows. These lava flows are accompanied by breccia and reach thicknesses of . Lahar deposits are found on the eastern slopes. Scarps on the eastsoutheast flanks resulted from sector collapses of the volcano. This collapse is known as Lomas Limpias and its scar has a surface area of . The collapse scar was later filled with products from explosive eruptions. Another collapse occurred on the southsouthwestern flank, forming the Los Bueyes collapse and terrace deposits. Nevado de Longav√≠ is a relatively small volcano. With a diameter of , a basal surface area of and a height above base level of , Nevado de Longav√≠ has a volume of about . The basement beneath the volcano is formed by the volcaniclastic Cura-Mall√≠n Formation of Eocene-Miocene age, Miocene plutons and the lavic-breccia Pliocene-Pleistocene Cola de Zorro formation. This last formation was identified as forming a deeply eroded volcano in the Cord√≥n de Villalobos south of Nevado de Longav√≠. This volcano south of Nevado de Longav√≠ is known as Villalobos. The emplacement of this formation was facilitated by a decrease in the compressional stress that had affected the region prior to the Pliocene. Some isolated monogenetic volcanic centres can be found southeast of Nevado de Longav√≠. Aside from Villalobos, this includes Resago and Loma Blanca. The first and the last are of Pleistocene age, based on their preservation. Resago is post-glacial. The last two centres appear to be related to a geological lineament that flanks the eastern slopes of Nevado de Longav√≠. 300px A glacier is found on the southern slope, between 1989 and 2017 glacier cover has decreased by over 95% with less than of glacier cover remaining. Previous glaciation is also supported by the presence of glacial striations on lava flows and of lahar deposits. The Rio Blanco originates on the southeastern slope of Nevado de Longav√≠, within the collapse scar. It turns south and west around the volcano in a fishhook pattern. The Estero Martinez and Quebrada Los Bueyes rivers also originate on Nevado de Longav√≠, on the western and southern flank respectively. They are both tributaries of the Rio Blanco. The Achibueno River also originates on the eastern flank of Nevado de Longav√≠ in a lake of the same name. It flows first northeastward and then turns around the volcano.  Composition  Nevado de Longav√≠ has chiefly erupted andesite, which forms about 80% of the volcano. Smaller amounts of basalt and dacite were also erupted by the volcano, the former in the early stages of activity and as basaltic andesite inclusions, the latter during the Holocene. Early stage rocks contain phenocrysts of clinopyroxene, olivine and plagioclase. Mainstage rocks in addition contain amphibole and orthopyroxene. In the Holocene rocks, apatite, iron and titanium oxides and sulfides have been found. Aside from minerals, gabbro and mafic rocks form enclaves. Granite xenoliths are also found. Unlike these granites, the gabbros appear to be cumulates considering their chemical similarity to Nevado de Longav√≠ rocks. The chemistry of Nevado de Longav√≠'s magmas is unusual among the volcanoes of the South Volcanic Zone. For example, the potassium content is unusually low. Likewise, incompatible elements are underrepresented. Modal amphibole is much more prevalent. Nevado de Longav√≠'s magmas have been referred to as adakitic, the only magmas of such chemistry in the Southern Volcanic Zone, but this classification has been contested. Fractional crystallization of amphibole has been invoked to explain some of the compositional patterns. On the basis of their rubidium content, Nevado de Longav√≠'s magmas have been classified in two groups. The rubidium-rich group resembles that of other volcanoes in the Southern Volcanic Zone; the rubidium- poor group conversely is the \\"unusual\\" one. The differences appear to reflect both different parental magmas and different magma evolution. There is a temporal pattern of the magmas becoming more rubidium-poor over time. The unusual chemical patterns appear to reflect that the magmas erupted from Nevado de Longav√≠ were extremely rich in water. Such a pattern has also been noted at Mocho-Choshuenco and Calbuco. All these volcanoes are located above the points where fracture zones intersect the Peru-Chile Trench, and it has been proposed that these fracture zones channel water into the mantle. In the case of Nevado de Longav√≠, the Mocha fracture zone is subducting beneath the volcano.  Eruptive history  Early stage basaltic andesite lava flows crop out on the northern and southwestern slopes of Nevado de Longav√≠. They originated at a site below the present-day summit and reach thicknesses of . Individual flows are about thick. These volcanic rocks are up to one million years old. During the main growth stage, volcanic activity was approximately constant considering the homogeneous structure of the lava flows. Temporary periods of dormancy however occurred, causing the formation of erosion valleys on the northern slope that were then filled by younger lava flows. These younger lava flows were themselves subject to glaciation.  Holocene  The last activity occurred during the Holocene, and included explosive activity. It was centered in the eastern collapse scar and on the summit region. In the eastern collapse scar, possibly subglacial activity formed a thick sequence including clasts, lava flows and silt. 6,835 ¬± 65 or 7,500 years before present, a large explosive eruption occurred. It deposited dacitic pumice more than southeast from the volcano. Maximum thickness of the deposits is . It is also known as the Rio Blanco fall deposit. In the eastern collapse scar, the pumice was later buried by an andesitic lava flow, which is undated and carries the name Castillo Andesite. The last eruption formed a lava dome within the collapse scar and the summit area. This eruption occurred about 5,700 years ago. A secondary collapse of the lava dome formed a large block and ash flow that descended the eastern slopes and covers a surface area of about . There is no reported historical volcanic activity, but fumarolic activity has been reported and remote sensing has found thermal anomalies on a scale of about . The volcano together with Lomas Blancas has been prospected for the potential of obtaining geothermal energy; estimated capacities are 248 megawatts.  Hazards  The volcano is ranked 22 on Chile's national volcano hazard scale. The towns closest to the volcano are Cerro Los Castillos, La Balsa, La Orilla, Las Camelias and Rinc√≥n Vald√©s; renewed eruptions could result in debris flows, eruption columns, lava flows and pyroclastic flows on the volcano and surrounding valleys. The Mendoza Province in Argentina could also be potentially affected by activity at Nevado de Longav√≠. The first recorded ascent occurred in 1965 by S. Kunstmann and W. Foerster, but evidence reported during that ascent implies that humans had reached the mountain earlier. Otherwise, Nevado de Longav√≠ is one of the important tourist attractions of the commune.

The redesign work was completed by the engineering staff of Ostmecklenburgische Flugzeugbau (OMF Aircraft), (East Mecklenburg Aircraft Works Limited) of Neubrandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany between 1998 and 2000. The aircraft produced by OMF were sold under the designation OMF-100-160 Symphony. Later aircraft produced by Symphony Aircraft are designated Symphony SA-160. The SA-160 has an aluminum wing design, utilizing a NASA GAW-2 Whitcomb airfoil. To simplify construction the wing has no washout and instead has two composite vortex generators of a unique design, outboard on each wing, to ensure that the inboard portion of the wing stalls first, thus retaining aileron control through the stall. The wing is equipped with slotted Fowler flaps, which occupy 2/3 of the span. These deploy to 40 degrees and lower the stall speed by 9 knots to 51 knots (60 mph). The flaps are always set to 20 degrees for takeoff. The ailerons are operated by control sticks and feature end-fences inboard and outboard for better slow speed and stall handling. The fuselage is a 4130 welded steel tube cage covered in a non-structural fibreglass skin. The tail group is a mix of fibreglass fairings and aluminum surfaces. The SA-160 is powered by a Lycoming O-320-D2A powerplant of 160 hp, driving a two-bladed wood fixed pitch MT propeller. Symphony Aircraft continued the development started by OMF on a Thielert Centurion 1.7 diesel powered version, which OMF had designated as the OMF-100-135. The performance with the 135 hp engine was disappointing and the project was shelved in 2005. Standard VFR avionics include a Garmin GNC 250XL GPS/COMM and GTX 320A Transponder The IFR avionics package consists of a Garmin 430 GPS/COMM, a 420 GPS/COMM and a Garmin GTX 327 transponder. The engine instruments are a Vision Microsystems VM 1000. The landing gear is of a tricycle configuration with all three wheels mounted on steel sprung gear legs. The nosewheel is free castering and the aircraft is steered with differential braking. The brakes are mounted conventionally on the rudder pedal toes. Prior to Symphony's bankruptcy, plans for the design included a 180 hp version to be called the SA-180 and a floatplane or amphibious floatplane version. Options The SA-160 was offered with an Avidyne glass cockpit Entegra EXP5000 Primary Flight Display, Entegra EX5000 Multi-Function Display and EMax Engine Indication System to replace the standard round instruments fitted. A Ballistic Recovery Systems whole aircraft parachute system was also available. Other options included a TAS 600 Traffic Advisory System and a Sensenich two bladed fixed pitch climb propeller to replace the MT two bladed wood/composite propeller. On April 3, 2006 Symphony Aircraft announced that a tuned exhaust system made by Power Flow Systems would be offered as an option on the SA-160. This US$1600 option was forecast to give a 10% improvement in rate of climb to about 781 ft/min, an increased optimal cruise speed of about 5 knots to about 133 knots, or 0.5 to 1.5 US gallon per hour decrease in fuel burn, down to about 7.5 US gallons per hour.Symphony Aircraft to Offer Power Flow Aircraft Exhaust System Pricing In 2006 Symphony offered the basic VFR equipped SA-160 for US$154,900, the IFR version for US$169,900 and the glass cockpit equipped version for US$214,900. Production The SA-160 entered production as the OMF-100-160 Symphony in 2001 and 40 aircraft were completed before OMF went out of business in December 2003. Production resumed at Symphony Aircraft Industries with the first SA-160 aircraft delivered on 13 May 2005. By June 2006 production had ceased as Symphony Aircraft Industries sought additional capital to resume production. On 22 January 2007, the company declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. On 3 February 2008 it was publicly announced that Lou Simons, the former lead investor in Symphony Aircraft, was planning to restart production of the SA-160 under the company name North American Factory for Technologically Advanced Aircraft (NAFTAA). The new company announced in July 2008 that they intended to restart production by the end of 2009 at the previous plant in Trois-Rivi√®res, Qu√©bec. They intended to produce 15 aircraft in 2009 and increase production to 50 to 80 per year by 2012. The aircraft would be given a new name and would have been available in a VFR version intended for flight school use, a basic IFR version, and a glass cockpit equipped version powered by a 200-hp Lycoming IO-390 powerplant giving it a forecast cruise speed of 148 knots. The plans were not completed and production did not resume. Aviatech Technical Services of Trois-Rivi√®res, Quebec in Canada is the current type certificate holder for the SA-160 and the OMF-100-150.

From the Late Middle Ages on the term and its derivatives were used to designate the entire body of the nobility. The term is related to the Iranian ƒÅzƒÅt-ƒÅn, \\"free\\" or \\"noble\\", who are listed as the lowest class of the free nobility in the bilingual (Middle Persian and Parthian) Hajjiabad inscription of King Shapur I, and parallels to the aznauri of Georgia. See the article in Wiktionary for further etymology. The azatk ø were a class of noble landowners directly subordinate to the princes and to the king, as prince of his own demesne, and at the same time a class of noble warriors, an equestrian order, whose vassalage to the dynasts was expressed, first of all, in the duty, which was also a privilege, of serving the feudal cavalry of their suzerains, as well as in other obligations. It seems plausible that they enjoyed certain minor governmental rights on their own lands. The azatk ø had their share in the major events of the country, such as at the election of the Catholicos of Armenia according to Faustus of Byzantium. M. L.

Their equivalence with the medieval Western knights was immediately recognized when, as during the Crusades, the two societies, Armenian and Frankish, existed side by side. Thus the Armeno-Cilician Code of the Constable Smbat (after 1275) explains the meaning of azat by dziavor, an Armenian adaptation of chevalier.

History  Map showing British Battalion engagements  Early volunteers  A number of British volunteers, including Tom Wintringham, David Marshall and Ramona and Nat Cohen, and Scots nurse Annie Murray, arrived in Spain during August‚ÄìSeptember 1936. The men formed the Tom Mann Centuria, and in July/August they had been part of an attempt to liberate Majorca. Later they were joined by Bill Scott, becoming a rifle company in the German-speaking Th√§lmann Column. The Th√§lmann Battalion later formed part of XII International Brigade and fought in the Siege of Madrid, including the Battle of Ciudad Universitaria. Another group of British volunteers ‚Äì among them Jock Cunningham and John Cornford ‚Äì fought with the French-speaking Commune de Paris Battalion, in the XI International Brigade. It also fought in the Siege of Madrid, including the battles for University City and Casa de Campo. In December 1936, 145 British volunteers formed No. 1 Company of the French-speaking Marseillaise Battalion, part of the XIV International Brigade. They fought on the C√≥rdoba front during December, and on the Madrid front during January 1937. Heavy fighting on 15 January at Las Rozas reduced the active ranks to 67.  Formation  In January 1937, the survivors of No.1 Company joined with 450 new British, Irish, and Dominion volunteers at Madrigueras, near Albacete, International Brigades headquarters. They were formed into an English-speaking battalion, with three infantry companies (Nos. 1, 3, 4) and a machine-gun company (no. 2). Canadian Bert \\"Yank\\" Levy served as an officer in No.2 company of the Saklatvala Battalion, under Wintringham from 1937. He was captured at the Battle of Jarama and spent six months in a Francoist gaol until he was released in a prisoner exchange. The battalion was numbered the 16th battalion of the International Brigades. It was formally named after Shapurji Saklatvala, the former Communist Member of Parliament (MP) for Battersea. However, this name never caught on and it was normally known as the \\"British Battalion\\". The Spanish also referred to it as \\"el batall√≥n brit√°nico\\" or \\"el batall√≥n ingl√©s\\". Number 1 company was later called the Major Attlee Company after the leader of the British Labour Party, who visited the British volunteers in December 1937. The British Battalion was attached to XV International Brigade, XV IB. The other battalions were the US Lincoln Battalion, the crack Balkan Dimitrov Battalion, and the Franco-Belgian Sixth February Battalion. Jarama, 1937 In February 1937, the battalion fought at the Battle of Jarama. In a single day's bloody fighting on 12 February against Moors from Francisco Franco's Army of Africa, the British Battalion suffered 275 casualties in No.1, No.3, and No.4 companies ‚Äì leaving 125 rifleman fit for duty. On the second day of fighting, the machine gun company was surrounded by Spanish Nationalist troops and many of its members were captured. Battalion commander Tom Wintringham was injured, and Jock Cunningham took command of the battalion's 140 survivors. The battalion remained in the trenches at Jarama until 17 June 1937. Brunete, 1937 Reinforced by new recruits and strengthened by returnees from hospital, the British Battalion mustered 331 brigaders at the Battle of Brunete. On 6 July, XV IB occupied the villages of Romanillos and Boadilla del Monte, and by midnight captured the village of Villanueva de la Ca√±ada. (It was here that Alex McDade who wrote the song, Valley of Jarama, commonly heard at Brigade reunions, was killed in action.) The following day the British were ordered to advance on Mosquito Ridge, a piece of high ground which overlooked the battalion's original objectives. As they left Villanueva de la Ca√±ada they were bombed by Junkers aircraft from the Condor Legion and shelled by Nationalist artillery. The two- hour barrage and devastating heat caused heavy casualties and prevented the battalion reaching Mosquito Ridge before Franco's army rushed reinforcements to defend the position. Only 42 members of the battalion were left fit for service, and the battalion was withdrawn into a reserve position.  Aragon, 1937  In mid-August, the Republican 35th Division, which included XV IB, was moved to Aragon. The focus of the Aragon campaign was to draw-off Nationalist attacks on Santander and to capture the strategic city of Zaragoza. On 25 August the battalion took part in street fighting to capture the Nationalist strongpoint at Quinto, where Wintringham, now head of the Officer's School and attached to the American Lincoln and Canadian MacKenzie/Papineau battalions, was shot again, this time badly and injured out of the war. On 25 August the battalion attacked a strong Francoist position at Purburrel Hill, and was repelled by intense rifle and machine gun fire. The following day another assault was made on the hill, supported by the XVth Brigade antitank artillery battery, and this time the attack succeeded. Heavy fighting had reduced the battalion to 100 men, and a number of Spanish Republican troops were drafted as reinforcements for the battalion.  Teruel, 1938  Ebro, 1938  Disbandment  On 21 September 1938, Juan Negr√≠n announced to the League of Nations that the Republican government would disband the International Brigades. The British battalion was withdrawn into reserve at the end of September 1938, and on 17 October, the battalion took part in the International Brigades' farewell parade through Barcelona. President Aza√±a and Prime Minister Negr√≠n joined the crowds who took part in one of the last great Republican celebrations. On disbandment, 305 British volunteers left Spain. They arrived at Victoria Station on 7 December, to be met by a crowd of supporters including Clement Attlee, Stafford Cripps, Willie Gallacher, and Will Lawther.  Welsh members An estimated 300 people from Wales enlisted in the International Brigades, fighting Franco in Spain from 1936‚Äì39. Of the battalion‚Äôs 170 Welsh volunteers, 116 were miners, one in five was married and the average age was over 30. The South Wales miners provided the largest regional group in the British battalion.Durham and South Wales Miners and the Spanish Civil War, Lewis Mates, Durham University, abstract, from: Twentieth Century British History, 2006,pp.373 INTERNATIONAL BRIGADE MEMORIAL TRUST Issue 15 / September 2006  Scottish members  Spanish Civil War Memorial for Scottish volunteers, Princes Street Gardens Edinburgh An estimated 500 volunteers went from Scotland to Spain to oppose fascism and support the Republican government there. A high proportion were working class members of the Communist party (which organised the mobilisation and transportation across France), many went in on foot over the Pyrenees.

As a result of Nobile's \\"whistleblowing,\\" the Education Department assigned the case to Louis N. Scarcella, a retired police detective who then worked for the school system. In 2004 it published his 30-page report that alleged Theresa Capra, Cobble Hill School's assistant principal of humanities, had tampered with scores and the principal Lennel George had covered up. Capra resigned during the investigation and denied the allegations. George was reassigned. In 2005, Richard J. Condon, the special commissioner of investigation for New York City schools, separately investigated the events at Cobble Hill. The result of his 23-month investigation was a 2007 report that, according to the New York Times, referred to Nobile as ‚Äúa subpar teacher with poor evaluations who wrongly accused Ms. Capra of engineering a cheating scheme because she had given him a negative review that could have led to his firing.‚Äù (After the first investigation, he gained tenure.) The report blamed investigator Scarcella for producing a ‚Äúdeeply flawed report,‚Äù and being ‚Äúbiased and overtly influenced by Mr. Nobile.‚Äù, who was at the time the union chapter leader. Capra was reinstated in the New York public schools, and George was allowed to return to Cobble Hill. Scarcella resigned his position after the 2007 report, and supervisory personnel in the investigation department also resigned. He maintained that his original 2005 report was accurate, stating, ‚ÄúAll I can say is I stand by my investigation.‚Ä¶To this day, Mr. Nobile was correct about everything.‚Äù Before the second report was published, earlier in 2007 Nobile had been reassigned to administrative duties related to an investigation of alleged corporal punishment of two students. Nobile responded to the allegations as being without cause. He described them ‚Äúretaliatory‚Äù and a ‚Äúsmear‚Äù due to his whistleblowing in 2004. In 2013 the New York Times reported on Louis Scarcella's earlier police work. It said that a man was released from prison after serving 20 years for a murder he did not commit. His 1990 conviction was overturned by the Brooklyn District Attorney after finding that Detective Scarcella had \\"coached\\" witnesses for the prosecution.Powell, Michael, \\"With Lives and Careers Destroyed, Asking Who Watches the Investigators?\\", New York Times, 25 March 2013, accessed 19 September 2013 In 2014, New York City overcame decades of resistance to appeals by the man, David Ranta, from the office of Brooklyn DA Charles Hynes agreed without a trial to a $6.4 million settlement in compensation.

The band was invited to appear at three day long, Strawberry Fields Festival, in August 1970. In 1971, they recorded their debut album called Kinfolk in the RCA studios in Toronto. Things were looking good for the band with a US tour. In addition, the album's first single, \\"Dickens\\", began gaining attention of US radio stations. However creative differences due to member turn-over rate was breaking the band up. It fell to singer Buzz Shearman to pick up the pieces and soldier on in 1972, when founding members Gord Waszek joining Fludd and Joe Agnello joining Grant Smith & The Power. Wally Cameron and Doni Underhill also decided to leave in 1974, with Underhill also joining Fludd. Shearman recruited Earl Johnson (guitar, and former member of the King Biscuit Boy band), Kim Fraser, then Terry Juric (bass guitar) and Bill Wade (drums), the latter being former members of Outlaw Music.

Rougier made many important contributions to epistemology, philosophy of science, political philosophy and the history of Christianity. Biography Rougier was born in Lyon. Debilitated by pleurisy in his youth, he was declared unfit for service in World War I and devoted his adolescence to intellectual pursuits. After receiving the agr√©gation de philosophie degree from the University of Lyon, Rougier taught until 1924 at various lyc√©es and obtained his doctorate from the Sorbonne in 1920. His doctoral thesis work was published that year as La philosophie g√©ometrique de Poincar√© and Les paralogismes du rationalisme. Rougier already had several publications to his name, however, beginning with a 1914 paper on the use of non-Euclidean geometry in relativity theory. Rougier taught in Algiers from 1917-1920, and then in Rome from 1920 to 1924. His first university appointment in France was at the University of Besan√ßon in 1925, where he served on the faculty until his dismissal in 1948 for political reasons. Further university appointments were in Cairo from 1931‚Äì36, the New School for Social Research from 1941‚Äì43 and the Universit√© de Montr√©al in 1945. Rougier's final academic appointment was to the Universit√© de Caen in 1954, but he retired at the age of 66 after only one year there. Death Rougier lived to the age of 93 and was survived by his third wife, Lucy Friedman. Dr. Friedman, whom he married in 1942, was a former secretary to Moritz Schlick. Although Friedman had a daughter from a previous marriage, Rougier himself had no children. Philosophy Under the influence of Henri Poincar√© and Wittgenstein, Rougier developed a philosophy based on the idea that systems of logic are neither apodictic (i.e., necessarily true and therefore deducible) nor assertoric (i.e., not necessarily true and whose truth must therefore be induced through empirical investigation.) Instead, Rougier proposed that the various systems of logic are simply conventions that are adopted based on contingent circumstances. This view, which implies that there are no \\"objective,\\" a priori truths that exist independently of the human mind, closely resembled the logical positivism of the Vienna Circle. Many members of this group, including Philipp Frank, greatly admired Rougier's 1920 work Les paralogismes du rationalisme. Rougier soon became the group's only French associate and formed close personal ties to several of its leading members, including Moritz Schlick (to whom Rougier's 1955 book Trait√© de la connaissance is dedicated) and Hans Reichenbach. Rougier also participated as an organizer and contributor to many Vienna Circle activities, including the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science. Rougier's own contribution to the Encyclopedia never materialized, however, because he soon became one of many participants who ended up quarreling with Otto Neurath, the project's editor-in-chief. Religion Rougier's conventionalist philosophical position naturally led him to oppose Neo-Thomism, which had been the official philosophy of the Roman Catholic Church since the 1879 encyclical Aeterna Patris but was gaining particular momentum during the 1920s and 1930s. Rougier published several works during this period attacking this contemporary revival of scholasticism, thereby earning the personal enmity of prominent Thomists such as √âtienne Gilson and Jacques Maritain. Rougier's objections to Neo-Thomism were not merely philosophical, however, but formed part of a general opposition to Christianity that he had already begun to develop during his adolescence under the influence of Ernest Renan. This early opposition to Christianity continued to influence intellectual work of Rougier's maturity, leading him in 1926 to publish a translation of Celsus that is still in use today. Politics Rougier was also a political philosopher in the liberal tradition of Montesquieu, Constant, Guizot, and Tocqueville. Consistent with his conventionalist epistemology, Rougier believed that political power rests not upon eternally valid claims, but upon conventions that he called mystiques. The only possible reason to prefer one political system over another, he believed, depends not on eternal truths but on purely pragmatic grounds. In other words, political systems should be chosen not based on how \\"true\\" they are, but rather on how well they work. After visiting the Soviet Union in 1932 on a visit sponsored by France's Ministry of Education, Rougier became convinced that planned economies do not work as well as market economies. This conviction led him to participate in the organization of the first neoliberal organization of the twentieth century, the Colloque Walter Lippmann, in 1938. During the same year, Rougier helped to found the Centre international d'√©tudes pour la r√©novation du lib√©ralisme. The political network established by these two groups eventually led to the 1947 foundation of the famous Mont Pelerin Society, to which Rougier was elected in the 1960s through the personal backing of Friedrich von Hayek. Rougier, as one of the founding fathers of neoliberalism, would no doubt have been admitted to the first meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society had it not been for a second political engagement that proved disastrous to his career and reputation: his activities on behalf of the Vichy regime in France during World War II. In October 1940, Philippe P√©tain sent Rougier on a secret mission to the British government in London, where he met with Winston Churchill between 21-25 October. Rougier later claimed in several published works that these meetings resulted in an agreement between Vichy and Churchill that he called the \\" Mission secr√®te √† Londres : les Accords P√©tain-Churchill \\", an allegation that the British government later denied in an official White Paper. Although these activities and publications eventually led to Rougier's dismissal in 1948 from his teaching position at the University of Besan√ßon, Rougier continued to be active throughout the 1950s in organizations that defended P√©tain. He also published works denouncing the √©puration (the French equivalent of denazification that was carried out on formerly Vichy territory by the Allies after the war) as illegal and totalitarian. Finally, Rougier was active in an effort that petitioned the United Nations in 1951, alleging that the Allies had committed human rights violations and war crimes during the Lib√©ration. During the 1970s, Rougier formed a second controversial political alliance: with the Nouvelle Droite of the French writer Alain de Benoist. Rougier's long-standing opposition to Christianity, together with his conviction that \\"the West\\" possesses a pragmatically superior mentalit√© to those of other cultures, aligned closely with the views of this movement. Benoist reissued and wrote prefaces to several of Rougier's earlier works, and in 1974 Benoist's think tank GRECE published an entirely new book by Rougier: Le conflit du Christianisme primitif et de la civilisation antique.

Operation In 1994, New Zealand Rail began The Lynx fast ferry service as part of the Interisland Line, with the 74-metre Incat catamaran being leased for that summer from Condor Ferries. It provided a faster alternative to the conventional ferries and . To complement the faster ferry, a passenger train from Picton to Christchurch and return was introduced. Named the Lynx Express, it debuted on Monday, 19 December 1994, and unlike the Coastal Pacific, it ran beyond Picton railway station to and from the ferry terminal. The Coastal Pacific Express, connecting with the conventional ferries, ran from Christchurch to Picton and back.

While CEO of SRI International, revenue tripled to $550 million per year and tens of billions of dollars of new marketplace value was created, such as through Siri, an SRI spin-off company that was bought by Steve Jobs at Apple. While Carlson was CEO Mayfield Ventures partner, David Ladd, said, ‚ÄúSRI is now the best enterprise at turning its technology into economic value.‚Äù Carlson has advised CEOs, ministers, and prime ministers on innovation and economic policy, including in the U.S., Denmark, Japan, Lithuania, Finland, Brazil, Taiwan, and Singapore. He served on President Obama‚Äôs National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship (NACIE). He is a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF). Carlson is the Founder and CEO of Practice of Innovation, LLC, a company working with start-ups, established companies, and government agencies on improving innovative performance. The innovation methodology he created at SRI is now used by companies and governments around the world, including the U.S., Singapore, Taiwan, Sweden, Finland, Chile, and Japan. His methodology is based on the use of NABC value propositions. NABC stands for the important customer and market Need, the unique and defensible Approach for the product and business model, and the Benefits per costs (value) of the product when compared to the Competition or alternatives. The utility of this definition is that it is the minimal complete formulation for a value proposition. NABC value propositions can be understood and used across the entire enterprise, regardless of size or type. A physics graduate of Worcester Polytechnic Institute and Ph.D. student in geophysical fluid dynamics from Rutgers University, he joined Sarnoff Corporation after graduation and performed research on computer vision, human perception, and digital video. While at Sarnoff, Carlson led teams that developed the HDTV standard and designed a system to assess broadcast image quality, both of which were awarded a Technology & Engineering Emmy Award. In 1998, Carlson was named CEO of SRI International.  Education  Carlson earned his B.S. in physics from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1967 and a Ph.D. in geophysical fluid dynamics from Rutgers University in 1973.

During that period he was Chairman of the Sarnoff Corporation. Carlson is known for a term known as \\"Carlson's Law\\", coined by New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman to describe Carlson's balance between autocracy and democracy in an organization: \\"In a world where so many people now have access to education and cheap tools of innovation, innovation that happens from the bottom up tends to be chaotic but smart. Innovation that happens from the top down tends to be orderly but dumb.\\" Memberships and awards In 2017 Carlson was selected to be a member of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute's \\"Hall of Luminaries.\\" This award has been given to only eleven previous individuals in the over 150 year history of the university. He is a WPI trustee emeritus. In December 2012, Carlson was named a Charter Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors.

He also participated in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. He was scheduled to participate in the 1940 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, but these were canceled due to the outbreak of World War II. Tarzan Brown is still one of only two Native Americans to have won the Boston Marathon (the other being Thomas Longboat of the Onondaga Nation from Canada, in 1907) and the only Native American to have more than one victory in Boston. He was inducted into the American Indian Athletic Hall of Fame in 1973. Brown set the American men's record for the marathon at the 1939 Boston Marathon (2:28:51) and at a 1940 marathon in Salisbury Beach, Massachusetts (2:27:30).http://www.nyrr.org/sites/default/files/World%20and%20U.S.%20Records.pdf Biography Ellison Myers Brown was born on September 12, 1913 in Porter Hill, Rhode Island to Narragansett Indian parents Byron Otis Brown and Grace Ethel Babcock, who had three daughters (Myra, Alice aka \\"Nina\\" and Grace) and four sons (including Ellison). Unfortunately for their family, the boys would not die peacefully of old age. Brown's brother Franklin drowned, Elwin died when a gun discharged being possibly an accident at the hands of a neighbor, and Clifford who was stabbed to death in Providence in a fight after being released from prison after murdering his best friend. Brown received little formal schooling. He attended the Tomaquag School in Alton for at least three years, and didn't complete his schooling beyond seventh grade. The nickname \\"Tarzan\\", so the story goes, was given to him early in life. He was a natural outdoorsman with an athletic build and much strength. He liked to climb trees, swing from branches rope to ropes. He wasn't afraid of heights, was strong, good balance, and seemingly had no limits. Tarzan Brown first received notice for running when he was merely 12 years old, as he ran and followed fellow Native American runner, Horatio Stanton, as Stanton was training for an upcoming race. Thomas \\"Tip\\" Salimeno, Stanton's trainer, took young Ellison under his wing when Ellison reached the age of 16, and the first steps to an illustrious career in marathon running were underway, a career that saw Brown eventually win the Boston Marathon in 1936 and 1939 and become a member of the 1936 U.S. Olympic team.  The Narragansett  The Narragansett can trace their lineage back to the Paleo-Indians from around 11,000 BCE, at the end of the last Ice Age, and some can trace back even further. The Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, in 1524, sailed along the Atlantic Coast and into Narragansett Bay. He lived among the native peoples for fifteen days and described them as having the most civil customs he had met on his voyage. The Narragansett lived under an organized system of leaders, and had relations with the neighboring tribes, in some cases providing protection for smaller bands. Methods of fishing and agriculture were developed by the regional inhabitants. There were many conflicts when the Europeans colonized the area in which the Narragansett people resided. In the Pequot War (1636‚Äì37), the Narragansett allied with the English, having been promised a part of the Pequot lands, but the promise was not kept. In December 1675, colonial soldiers destroyed the winter camp of the Narragansett, massacring a majority of women, children, and elderly men. This became known as the Great Swamp Massacre. Three hundred women and children may have been burned to death that day, along with an estimated six hundred Narragansett men killed. Hundreds of others were chained and sold into slavery. By the end of the war the population of the Narragansett, initially 15,000 to 17,000, was reduced, by one estimate, to perhaps only 500 survivors. Heartbreak Hill and 1936 Boston Marathon victory Heartbreak Hill is an ascent over 0.4-mile (600 m) between the 20 and 21-mile (32 and 34 km) marks, near Boston College. It is the last of four \\"Newton hills\\", which begin at the mark and challenge contestants with late (if modest) climbs after the course's general downhill trend to that point. Though Heartbreak Hill itself rises only vertically (from an elevation of ),Boston Marathon Official Program, April 2005, p.68 it comes in the portion of a marathon distance where muscle glycogen stores are most likely to be depleted‚Äîa phenomenon referred to by marathoners as \\"hitting the wall.\\" \\"Tarzan\\" Brown had taken off so fast at the start of the 1936 Boston Marathon that the press followed the second runner, John A. Kelley, until the 20-mile mark, and it was on this hill that Kelley caught up to Tarzan. As Kelley overtook Tarzan‚Äîan amazing feat given the steady record breaking pace Tarzan had set‚ÄîKelley patted Tarzan on the back. What followed was a struggle between Tarzan, who took the lead on the downhills, and Kelley, who took the lead on the uphills, until finally Tarzan took the lead again to win the race, as Kelley faded to a fifth-place finish. This struggle inspired reporter Jerry Nason to name the last Newton hill \\"Heartbreak Hill\\" because Tarzan \\"broke Kelley's heart\\" there. 1936 Olympic Games in Hitler's Germany and iron man stunt Brown was selected to compete on the U.S. Olympic team for the 1936 Olympic Games in Nazi Germany and was a teammate of the legendary track and field star Jesse Owens. There are various stories of what exactly occurred while Brown was in Hitler's Germany for the 1936 Olympics. It is known that for more than half of the Olympic marathon, Brown was holding his own and was in the top five when an issue with some leg cramps arose. Brown was known to have issues with a hernia from time to time, but he was suffering from leg cramps, and ultimately this forced him to withdraw and be disqualified from competition when a German spectator stepped in to aid him with rubbing out the cramps. Later in 1936, Brown won the venerable Port Chester, NY marathon in 2:36:56.7. The next day, October 12, 1936, he won a second marathon, the New England Marathon Championship in Manchester, New Hampshire, in 2:45:52, which he later stated was to show critics and detractors that he had not quit in the Berlin Olympics, earlier in 1936. 1939 Boston Marathon victory In 1939, Brown was the first runner to break the 2:30 mark on the post-1926 Boston course.Tarzan Brown Bio, Stats, and Results  Olympics at Sports-Reference.com According to official data from the Boston Athletic Association, many runners prior to 1926 finished the Boston Marathon in times under 2:30 (see List of winners of the Boston Marathon). Those runners competed on courses known to be shorter than the IAAF-defined marathon distance of 42.195 kilometers.ARRS Boston Marathon page After the 17-mile mark in the 1939 race, Brown also broke every checkpoint record. He would later qualify for the 1940 U.S. Olympic team but the games were canceled due to World War II's outbreak in Europe. Other notable moments in the Boston Marathon Tarzan was also renowned for his antics during the Boston Marathon. In one of his earliest appearances as a runner in the 1935 race, he arrived in an outfit sewn together from one of his mother's old dresses by his sisters and he had sneakers that were falling apart; this was just two days after his mother had died. Approximately 21 miles into the race, Tarzan removed his sneakers, threw them into the crowd and ran the rest of the race (approximately five miles) barefoot, finishing 13th. This act etched him in the memories of Boston Marathon fans and endeared him in the hearts of many more. He had officially become a fan favorite and perhaps the most exciting, unorthodox and colorful character in the Boston Marathon's history. Then in the 1938 running of the Boston Marathon, Tarzan was leading on what was an unseasonably warm day when midway through the race, he ran off the road, waved to the crowd and jumped into Lake Cochituate to swim and cool off. After a while, he returned and ran the rest of the course, though other runners had already long since passed by. Most notably, fellow Rhode Islander Les Pawson (of Pawtucket, Rhode Island) won that year. Pawson was one of Tarzan's top rivals and friends. Tarzan was also seen arriving shortly before the start of the 1939 Boston Marathon eating hot dogs and drinking milkshakes just before the race and claimed that he had missed breakfast. Incidents like these led one member of the media to write insensitively about Brown. Most sports writers of that time period, when Tarzan first started running competitively, saw him as a \\"penniless redskin who would rather fish than work\\". Personal life, death and legacy In addition to running, Brown worked as a stonemason and shellfisherman. He married a fellow Narragansett Indian named Ethel (Wilcox) Brown (April 23, 1919 - October 14, 2015) and had four children. He would sell the medals and trophies he won while racing in order to support his family. His nephews saw him as a story telling man. Many varied accounts of the events on the evening of August 23, 1975 directly leading to Brown's death have been told, some stating he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, waiting for a ride home, as an altercation may have been taking place. However, amidst whatever confusion and circumstances there may have been, he was killed when a van hit him outside a bar in Westerly, Rhode Island. Brown's injuries proved to be fatal. There is an annual Mystic River road race named in his honor in Mystic, Connecticut, every fall. As part of a conference commemorating past Native American runners of the Boston Marathon and to acknowledge the history and significance of running in Native American cultures, which led up to the day of the 2016 Boston Marathon race, Narragansett tribal member Mikki Wosencroft ran and completed the Boston course, as an acknowledged representative of Brown's family and the Narragansett tribe. *\\"The economy in these depression times provided little for most Americans and nothing for Indians.

A former England Under-21 striker, Gallen signed a professional contract for Queens Park Rangers on his 17th birthday after setting phenomenal scoring records whilst in the youth team, breaking Jimmy Greaves' long-standing record at that level. Playing career=Queens Park Rangers Gallen made his Queens Park Rangers league debut in the Premier League at Old Trafford on the opening day of the 1994‚Äì95 season, and later went on to form a partnership with Les Ferdinand, scoring more than ten goals. Gallen's form dipped the next season after Ferdinand departed for Newcastle United, as QPR were relegated to The First Division. After just two games of the 1996‚Äì97 season, in which he scored three goals, Gallen sustained a serious knee injury whilst playing against Portsmouth, which resulted in him missing the rest of the season. His return to the team saw mixed performances, but by the 1998‚Äì99 season he was back to his best form, before injuries again held him back and the arrival of Rob Steiner and Chris Kiwomya kept him out of the team. The 1999-00 campaign saw Gallen fall behind Kiwomya, Steiner, Steve Slade and Mikkel Beck in the pecking order. He did, however, manage to score a winning goal on the last day of the season at the ground where his injury troubles had started ‚Äì Portsmouth. Huddersfield and Barnsley In August 2000 he left QPR to find first-team football at Huddersfield Town. His return to Loftus Road as an opposition player saw him score, but then miss a penalty. Gallen soon found himself out in the cold once more as Huddersfield changed managers, and his contract was not renewed at the end of the season. Gallen spent the summer of 2001 training with QPR, now in Division Two, with a view to joining on a free transfer, but a compromise on wages could not be reached. He instead joined Barnsley on a two-year contract. Return to QPR The deal at Barnsley proved to be a short-lived, as Gallen re-joined Queens Park Rangers on 19 November 2001. Two days after returning to his boyhood club he scored one and set up two others in an emphatic 4‚Äì0 home win over Swindon. A change in fortunes soon followed for Gallen and QPR, with Gallen earning the club captaincy, netting another 55 goals over the ensuing five seasons and helping the club to establish itself back in the second tier of English football. Overall, Gallen scored 97 goals for QPR, making him the sixth highest scorer in the club's history. Plymouth and MK Dons On 11 January 2007 Gallen linked up with his former QPR manager Ian Holloway, joining Plymouth Argyle on loan until the end of 2006‚Äì07 season. During his spell at Home Park he scored once in the league, during a 3‚Äì2 victory over Coventry City. He was released by QPR in July 2007. He was offered a contract by Plymouth Argyle, but instead opted to join a lower-level club ‚Äì Milton Keynes Dons. Gallen played 31 games and scored nine goals as MK Dons won both promotion to League One as champions, and The Football League Trophy. Luton Town On 14 November 2008, Gallen joined League Two side Luton Town on an initial one-month loan, which was later extended by a further month. His run in the team at Luton coincided with a seven match unbeaten run for The Hatters, with Gallen often being used as a midfielder. At the beginning of January, Gallen had his contract at MK Dons terminated by mutual consent, and he subsequently signed for Luton as a free agent. Gallen signed a one-year extension to his Luton contract at the end of the season, a campaign that ultimately ended in Luton's relegation to the Conference, keeping him at the club until June 2010. Now in non-league football, Gallen found himself utilised back in his familiar position as a striker, scoring eighteen goals in the 2009‚Äì10 season, including his first ever hat-trick on 5 April 2010 in a 6‚Äì0 win over Grays Athletic. His goalscoring prowess saw him sign a further one-year extension to his contract, running until the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season. In October 2010 Gallen joined Barnet on a three-month loan deal. He scored one goal in nine appearances during his time at the club, before returning to Luton on 8 January 2011. On 31 January 2011, Gallen was released from his Luton contract. He made a total of 74 appearances for Luton, scoring 21 goals. On 31 March 2011, Gallen signed for Braintree Town. After a short spell with Leverstock Green in 2011‚Äì12, Gallen signed for Aylesbury United of the Molten Spartan South Midlands League Premier Division at the start of the 2012‚Äì13 season. Life after playing In January 2015, Gallen was a finalist alongside Rufus Brevett for the Harrow Borough job, although the job was handed to Steve Baker instead.http://www.kilburntimes.co.uk/sport/football/new_harrow_borough_boss_beat_off_competition_from_qpr_legends_to_land_ryman_league_job_1_3931260 Gallen has appeared on The Magic Sponge podcast by Dave which is hosted by comedians Rob Beckett, Ian Smith and ex-footballer Jimmy Bullard. He has appeared twice as a guest, one time being a late replacement for Chris Iwelumo. Gallen became a cult hero on the podcast and occasionally steps in for Jimmy Bullard as a co-host when Jimmy is absent. Personal life Gallen has two brothers in football, Joe and Steve, who have both also worked as coaches for QPR. He has two daughters and a son.

While originally a hill fort, the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Knights built the castle in the fifteenth century, the palace was added in the sixteenth century, and restoration began in the nineteenth century.  History  Castle ruins in 1792 The castle stands on the narrow peninsula at the confluence of the rivers M≈´≈°a and Mƒìmele where they form the Lielupe river. In ancient times, the hill was the site of a Semigallian fortress. The first stone buildings were established between 1443 and 1450 by the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Knights and construction continued till the end of the 16th century. The old section of the castle featured a great watch tower, 3.5 meter thick walls, a prison under the tower, a garrison and a drawbridge at the gates. Construction started under the rule of the Master of the Livonian Order, Heidenreich Vinke von Overberg (1439 ‚Äì 1450). The castle was intended to strengthen the Order's power over Semigallia, to protect the border with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and to control the trade route from Lithuania to Riga. The castle was both the military stronghold and the administrative centre of the area. In a treaty of alliance in 1559, the Livonian Order passed sovereignty of the town and the castle to Poland. Archbishop of Riga Wilhelm von Brandenburg was in possession of the castle when the Livonian Order collapsed in 1562, and the castle was turned over to Gotthard Kettler when he became the first Duke of Courland, and it became one of the main ducal residences. In 1568, 1590 and 1601 the Landtags of Duchy of Courland and Semigallia were held here. Under Duke Friedrich, a new wing was added in 1590 with additional expansion in 1599, creating a modern residence with two massive round towers. During the Polish-Lithuanian wars with Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus captured the castle on 17 September 1625, thoroughly looting the \\"safeguarded\\" treasures of the surrounding nobility that had been stored there. In 1706, during the Great Northern War, both castle and palace were blown up by the retreating Russians and left unrestored. More than 150 years later, in 1874, Prince Paul von Lieven purchased the ruins and began their restoration.

The consensus reached was that the operation of the railroad needed to be a multi-county venture and that a regional approach was necessary as trackage begins and ends outside individual county boundaries. In addition, it was felt that the pooling of resources was necessary in order to operate a railroad in a very competitive environment and, conversely, to obtain the funding necessary to operate a railroad from the State and Federal governments. The Lackawanna Railroad Authority, established in 1985 has over 16 million dollars in assets and operates more than of track in Lackawanna, Wayne and Monroe Counties. The Monroe County Rail Authority was created in 1980, and controls over 12 million dollars in assets with trackage totaling . Its primary objective is to re- establish rail passenger service with New Jersey Transit between Scranton and Hoboken, New Jersey by way of the Lackawanna Cut-Off, with connecting service into Manhattan, New York. The designated freight operator of the Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Rail Authority lines is the Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad and tourism operator is Steamtown National Historic Site.

In his career, he has also played for Arsenal, Queens Park Rangers, Bournemouth and Crawley Town. Shimmin mainly plays as a centre half. Career (England) Shimmin started his career, spending six years at Highbury playing for the various youth teams at Arsenal under Ars√®ne Wenger. After leaving the Gunners, Shimmin made the move across the city to Queens Park Rangers, with whom he played from 2005 until January 2008. The deal was for a small nominal fee at first, with up to ¬£80,000 in add-ons, dependent on appearances. Shimmin made his d√©but against Coventry City in a 3‚Äì0 defeat, however a serious knee injury prevented him from playing many games for QPR. During this time Shimmin had a loan spell at Bournemouth where he only managed 2 league games due to injury. Prior to that he was a youth player with Arsenal until 2004. QPR announced that Shimmin's contract had been cancelled by mutual consent on 28 January 2008. On 8 February 2008, Shimmin joined Crawley Town on a short-term deal. He was released in March, after failing to overcome a hamstring injury. He impressed whilst at Crawley and it was with a heavy heart that the Red Devils were forced to release him. Career (Scotland) In July 2008, Shimmin joined St Mirren on trial, but signed for Greenock Morton soon afterwards. Shimmin made his Morton d√©but in a Co-operative Insurance Cup tie at Stair Park, in which Morton won 6‚Äì3 against the home side Stranraer to progress to the second round where Morton would dispose of SPL side Hibernian in a seven-goal thriller. He made his first league appearance for Morton in a 2‚Äì2 draw with St Johnstone at Cappielow on 8 August 2008. Shimmin was named Irn-Bru Phenomenal Young Player of the Month for October 2008, after helping Morton to rally after a poor start to the season. Shimmin spent nine months out 'injured', from March 2009, making a return on the bench for the Scottish Cup game at Dumbarton on 5 December. He was released by Morton at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season. Shimmin, as of 27 May 2010 has signed a two-year contract at Dundee. He had his contract terminated by administrators on 15 October 2010. Return to England After his release by Dundee, Shimmin signed in 2011 for Dover Athletic.

The primary mission of the FMCSA is to reduce crashes, injuries and fatalities involving large trucks and buses.  History  This large regulatory agency was established as a separate administration within U.S. Department of Transportation on January 1, 2000, pursuant to the \\"Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999.\\"Public law -106-159; Accessed 2010-12-16' FMCSA is headquartered in Washington, D.C. and employs more than 1,000 people in all 50 States and the District of Columbia, with the goal of making \\"roadways safer for the public and the CMV industry\\". Main functions In carrying out its safety mandate to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities involving large trucks and buses, FMCSA: * Develops and enforces data-driven regulations that balance motor carrier (truck and bus companies) safety with efficiency; * Harnesses safety information systems to focus on higher risk carriers in enforcing the safety regulations; * Targets educational messages to carriers, commercial drivers, and the public; and * Partners with stakeholders including Federal, State, and local enforcement agencies, the motor carrier industry, safety groups, and organized labor on efforts to reduce bus and truck-related crashes.  Leadership  Raymond P. Martinez was sworn in as Administrator of the FMCSA on February 28, 2018. Previously, Martinez served as Chairman and Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission. Cathy F. Gautreaux became the Agency‚Äôs Deputy Administrator in November 2017 after serving as the Executive Director of the Louisiana Motor Transportation Association for 29 years. Organization The FMCSA is divided into 8 offices: * Office of the Administrator: MC-A * Office of Administration: MC-M * Office of Chief Counsel: MC-C * Office of Chief Financial Officer: MC-B * Office of Enforcement: MC-E * Office of Policy: MC-P * Office of Research and Information Technology: MC-R * Field Operations: MC-F Field offices The field organizations deliver program services to FMCSA partners and customers. This organization consists of Field Operations, Service center and State-level motor carrier division offices. These offices answer questions and provide guidance concerning the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. * List of FMCSA Service Centers * List of FMCSA Field Offices Main programs=Compliance, Safety, Accountability (CSA) Compliance, Safety, Accountability (CSA) is described by FMCSA as its \\"data- driven safety compliance and enforcement program designed to improve safety and prevent commercial motor vehicle crashes, injuries, and fatalities\\". This program oversees carriers‚Äô safety performance through roadside inspections and crash investigations, issuing violations when instances of noncompliance with safety regulations are uncovered. The Agency‚Äôs safety investigation team and state law enforcement partners are small compared to the millions of CMV companies and commercial driver license (CDL) holders nationwide. A key component of the CSA program ‚Äì known as the Safety Measurement System (SMS) ‚Äì relies on data analysis to identify non-compliant and unsafe companies to prioritize them for enforcement interventions. While the methodology for calculating SMS safety scores has evolved over time in response to suggestions from stakeholders, the program has proven effective at identifying unsafe, high-risk carriers. FMCSA is expected to publicly release additional changes to SMS designed to strengthen the Agency‚Äôs ability to identify companies for investigation before they are involved in a crash. The program's future remains in doubt as it has been the subject of heavy criticism from the DOT's own Inspector General, the Government Accountability Office, and Congress itself in the FAST Act. That Act requires the National Research Council of the National Academies of Science (NAS) to conduct a thorough study of the Compliance, Safety, Accountability (CSA) program, specifically the Safety Measurement System (SMS). Hours of Service (HOS) and Driver Restart Study In July 2013, FMCSA updated HOS regulation to help reduce the incidence of CMV driver fatigue on the nation‚Äôs roadways. The final rule required truck drivers who use the ‚Äú34-hour restart‚Äù provision to maximize their weekly work hours to limit the restart to once a week and to include in the restart period at least two nights off duty from 1:00 to 5:00 a.m., when one‚Äôs 24-hour body clock supposedly needs and benefits from sleep the most. In December 2014, Congress passed the FAST Act, which suspended the new 34-hour restart provision in the HOS rule and instructed FMCSA to study its effectiveness. In 2015, FMCSA selected Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) to conduct the largest naturalistic study of its kind that the Agency had ever undertaken. FMCSA anticipated releasing the findings in 2017. National Registry Implemented in 2014, the National Registry rule requires all Medical Examiners (ME) who conduct physical examinations and issue medical certifications for interstate CMV drivers to complete training on FMCSA‚Äôs physical qualification standards, pass a certification test, and demonstrate competence through periodic training and testing. CMV drivers whose medical certifications expire must use MEs on the National Registry for their examinations. FMCSA has reached its goal of at least 40,000 certified MEs signing onto the registry, meaning drivers can now find certified medical examiners throughout the country who can competently perform their medical exam. FMCSA is preparing to issue a follow-on ‚ÄúNational Registry 2‚Äù rulemaking that will require MEs to submit medical certificate information on a daily basis. These daily updates, which FMCSA will transmit to states electronically, will dramatically decrease the chance of drivers falsifying medical cards. CSA overhaul In 2015 a Congressional mandate, that was part of the Fixing America‚Äôs Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act), directed a full review of the CSA program by the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Transportation and the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The review (study) was named the \\"Correlation Study Corrective Action Plan\\". The FMCSA had already started implementing changes in the CSA but withdrew these after the study was published. Fleet mileage will be included in the new plan and the FMCSA will study sharing information with the International Registration Plan (IRP) and International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) organizations with consideration of incentives for voluntary mileage updates. The FMCSA will partner with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in getting states to participate in uniform crash reporting standards. In September 2018 the FMCSA began small-scale testing using an Item Response Theory (IRT) model to replace the Safety Measurement System with plans for full testing in 2019. The FMCSA currently uses percentile comparisons (relative rankings) of similar fleets when computing the \\"Behavioral Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories\\" (BASIC) scores but will study if absolute measures of safety should be used instead. The Safety Measurement System (SMS) website was changed in September 2018 with certain previous public information on property carrier‚Äôs compliance and safety performance information now withheld. Ten organizations, including the American Trucking Association (ATA), Truckload Carriers Association (TCA), and OOIDA, co-signed a letter to then Department of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, requesting that CSA scores not be available to the public. Industry concerns have long been that the CSA scoring is \\"highly defective\\", has inconsistencies with the Safety Measurement System, and has \\"significant shortcomings\\". Concerns Shippers and brokers have used the CSA scores as a bench-mark to find safe carriers. With this hidden there may be more calls for legislation establishing uniform federal standards for qualifying carriers. House Bill H.R.1568 was introduced, that was referred to the subcommittee of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, and Senate Bill S.1345 was introduced, that was read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The insurance industry also used the CSA scores to evaluate the overall fitness and risk profile of carriers and drivers. The American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI) released a report in 2015 criticizing the CSA scoring, citing that a lack of \\"crash accountability or crash weighting in CSA has long-plagued the program\\", negatively affecting scores on crashes that are not the fault of the carrier or driver. The ATRI report found that negative scores resulted from trucks colliding with an animal in the roadway, another driver hitting a legally parked truck, another driver running a red light or stop sign and hitting a truck, another driver being under the influence of drugs or alcohol and hitting a truck, and truck-assisted suicide by a pedestrian and that non- preventable crashes needs to be removed from carriers‚Äô CSA records. Applicability of FMCSA regulations All non-exempt commercial motor vehicles that cross state lines, including big-rig trucks, are subject to the federal motor carrier safety regulations. If these semi-trucks are operating within one state, they need to abide by state-equivalent motor carrier safety regulations. The intent of the regulations is to cover all persons and entities involved in operating commercial vehicles, including: drivers, hiring managers, trainers, supervisors, managers, dispatchers, other people whose action affects drivers and commercial motor vehicles. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) set forth minimum standards for those involved with the operation of commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce, in order to cover all people and entities involved in interstate operation of these trucks. Consumer protection initiatives=\\"Look Before You Book\\" FMCSA's \\"Look Before You Book\\" campaign encourages trip planners and passengers to think about more than price and to consider safety first when choosing bus companies and drivers. The program features DOT‚Äôs first app ‚Äì SaferBus ‚Äì that provides safety data on each bus company under FMCSA‚Äôs jurisdiction. The primary audiences for this campaign are travel planners that serve faith-based organizations, seniors and student groups. Protect Your Move Of the estimated 35 million Americans who move each year, about 600,000 hire a company to move their household goods across state lines. FMCSA receives about 3,000 complaints annually about deceptive practices and fraud by dishonest operators. The Protect Your Move program aims to protect consumers and counter interstate moving fraud in two ways: 1) by educating consumers who are preparing to move to make informed decisions about moving companies and avoid being taken advantage of by a disreputable mover; and 2) by providing tools and information to victims after moving fraud has occurred to help them resolve mover disputes and/or file fraud complaints and seek arbitration or legal action.
