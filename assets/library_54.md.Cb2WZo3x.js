It was founded on December 12, 1888 and merged with Zeta Tau Alpha on August 7, 1964. History Beta Sigma Omicron was founded at the University of Missouri on December 12, 1888 by Eulalie Hockaday, Kathering Turner and Maude Haines. As of 1909, the sorority had 10 active chapters and 3 alumnae associations. These 10 chapters were at Belmont College, Brenau College, Centenary College (Cleveland, TN),Centenary College closed in 1929. Central College, Fairmont Seminary, Hardin College, Liberty Ladies' College (Liberty, MO), Stephens College, Synodical College, Transylvania College. Beta Sigma Omicron became an Associate member of the National Panhellenic Conference in 1930 and a full member in 1933. At Beta Sigma Omicron's 1963 Convention (75th anniversary), a vote on absorption or disbanding was taken. Although Beta Sigma Omicron had chartered 61 chapters and had almost 15,000 initiated sisters, at the time of the anniversary, it only had 13 active chapters, and thus no longer met the National Panhellenic Conference's membership requirements. The vote was unanimous for absorption and Beta Sigma Omicron looked for an organization for merger. On August 7, 1964, Beta Sigma Omicron was absorbed by Zeta Tau Alpha. Of the 13 active chapters: Howard College, Millsaps College, William Jewell College, University of Evansville, Thiel College, Westminster College, and Youngstown College were absorbed into Zeta Tau Alpha. Louisiana State University, Baldwin Wallace University and Indiana University of Pennsylvania were released (Zeta Tau Alpha already had chapters on their campuses) and three small chapters at urban schools in New York and Ohio chose to become local sororities.Fall 2014 Themis, page 50-51 Symbols The Badge is a monogram of the sorority letters, with the Omicron around the Beta and the Sigma superimposed on the Omicron. *Colors - Ruby and Pink *Flower - Red and Pink Carnations *Jewel - Ruby *Open Motto - We Live to do Good *Insignia - Stars, Covenant, Lamp, Laurel *Patron - Hestia *Magazine - The Beta Sigma Omicron, first published in 1905, The Lamp (esoteric), and The Urn *Convention - June 1910 in Louisville, KY Chapter List As of 1963, the chapters of Beta Sigma Omicron were: (italic for chapters closed at that time.) *Alpha - 1888 - University of Missouri (inactive 1892) *Beta - 1891 - Synodical Female College (inactive 1928) *Gamma I - 1892 - Missouri Valley College (inactive 1895) *Delta - 1898 - Sedalia, Missouri High school (inactive 1907) *Epsilon - 1902 - Hardin College - (inactive 1925) *Zeta (1)- 1902 - Potter (Kentucky) (inactive 1909) *Eta - 1902 - Stephens College (inactive 1925) *Theta - 1903 - Belmont College (inactive 1914) *Iota - 1903 - Mary Baldwin Seminary (inactive 1907) *Kappa - 1904 - Fairmont Seminary (Washington DC) (inactive 1913)This school was founded by Dr. Arthur Ramsey in 1899, near the area of 19th and Belmont Rd, according to a 11 July 1920 article in the Washington Post, accessed 26 Aug 2020.

It was approved by the Cortes Generales through Organic Law 1/1995 of March 13, published in the Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado the following day. At the same time, the Statute of Autonomy of Melilla was also approved. Process The Spanish Constitution of 1978 establishes in its Fifth Transitory Provision: In turn, Article 144 establishes: Since 1981, the recognition of autonomy had previously been sought on several occasions without reaching a consensus of the various political forces in its formulation, what originated in the city the appearance of diverse protest platforms that urged the political class for its treatment, which finally took place within the framework of the Autonomous Agreements between PP and PSOE of 1992. The main point of dissension originated in the treatment of the political regime, by which one of the parties wished to give it a status similar to that of an autonomy but not equal, while the other desired that, as an integral part of the Spanish Nation and according to the aforementioned Fifth Transitory Provision, full autonomy will be granted. Finally, the consensus came through the figure of the Autonomous City. Reaction in Morocco The Moroccan government considers that Ceuta and Melilla, as well as the Plazas de Soberan√≠a located on the North African coast, are occupied territory that must be reintegrated. The statute of Autonomy of Ceuta establishes in its preliminary title that Ceuta is an integral and indissoluble part of the Spanish Nation, which rejects any consideration of the Moroccan claims. Both in the framework of its project and in its approval, there were several protests by the Moroccan executive, as well as other political leaders of the country, that calmed down by the end of 1995. Later reforms Since 2005 there is a project to reform the statute, which among its main objectives has to be called finally an autonomous community and acquire greater powers, limited in its regime due to its special nature.

Its life as a passenger station was short and it was quickly converted to goods station, a role which it played for more than a century.  History  The station opened on 15 April 1844 by the Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway. It was adjacent to Gilesgate and Station Lane. This was the second of four railway stations built to serve Durham City, the first being Shincliffe (later being renamed Shincliffe Town) on the Durham & Sunderland Railway. Due to the inconvenient site of the station, it had a short lifespan, only being open for 13 years before closing to passengers on 1 April 1857, although it remained open for goods traffic. In the 1898 map the station was called Durham and Belmont - Goods Trains and in the 1913 Railway Clearing House map it was referred to as Durham Goods. There was a trainshed to the southeast of the platform with a pair of carriage sidings. A wooden goods shed joined the trainshed and had one single line going into it. Kepier Colliery was nearby which closed in the 1920s. The station closed to goods traffic on 18 November 1966 and the tracks were quickly lifted. The station building is now a Travelodge.

These were the first parliamentary elections in Portugal. This election aimed to form assemblies in three levels: parochial, provincial, and the Constituent Cortes of 1820.  Background  Portugal was ruled as an absolute monarchy since 1698, the last time Portugal had any sort of representative assembly prior to 1820.J.H. Saraiva, (1993) Historia de Portugal p.231 The Liberal Revolution had as its main political objective the creation of a democratically elected parliament, but there were three approaches to what sort of parliamentary government should be established: * A slight adaptation of the Spanish Constitution of 1812; * A revival of the Portuguese Cortes; * A direct election parliamentary system. While the latter option initially won, the aftermath of the Martinhada (11 November 1820) would lead to the Spanish Constitution of 1812 option being implemented in the 1820 elections. Electoral system The new electoral law was introduced on 22 November and had been directly translated from 1812 Spanish constitution, which had a wide electoral franchise but indirect electoral system.Dieter Nohlen & Philip St√∂ver (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p1529 All literate men had the right to vote except monks, servants, and some other groups. Otherwise eligible men in Portuguese colonies were also allowed to vote. In a three-stage process, the electorate directly elected members of parochial assemblies, who then elected provincial assemblies whose members then elected the members of the legislature (i.e., the Constituent Cortes of 1820). There were a total of six provinces in mainland Portugal: Alentejo, Beira, Estremadura, Minho, Tr√°s-os-Montes, and Algarve. Results The 110 elected members included 43 jurists and magistrates, 20 academics, 15 members of the church, 11 military personnel, five property owners, three physicians and three tradespeople. The vast majority were members of masonic societies.  Aftermath  This election would form the Constituent Cortes of 1820, which would nominate a new government (the Reg√™ncia which replaced the provisional government Junta Provisional do Governo Supremo do Reino), create the Portuguese Constitution of 1822 and order John VI of Portugal to return from Brazil to swear the 1822 Constitution.

Taubergie√üen was declared Naturschutzgebiet (Nature Reserve) in 1979 and, with 1,697 hectares, is one of the largest protected areas in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. It has a north-south extension of more than 12 km. The largest width is about 2.5 km. Nature Reserve Taubergie√üen Name The name \\"Taubergie√üen\\" derives from Taubergie√üen, one of the numerous watercourses and branches of the nature reserve, which runs in the north of the area and drains from the right into the lower course of the Elz river, which is closer to the Rhine. Under \\"pouring\\" is understood underground, i.e. in direct connection with the groundwater flowing parts of the stream, which come from a sufficient depression of the bottom again to the surface. These are particularly common in this area, the middle area of the southern Upper Rhine. The word \\"deaf\\" describes nutrient-poor waters with low fish population. Geography Taubergie√üen Taubergie√üen is located in the southern Upper Rhine plain between Freiburg im Breisgau and Offenburg in the districts Emmendingen and Ortenau, near the northeastern town of Lahr and immediately west of the communities Kappel-Grafenhausen, Rust and Rheinhausen. Taubergie√üen belongs predominantly to the district of the communities Kappel-Grafenhausen, Rust and Rheinhausen. 9.98 km ¬≤ property of the French community Rhinau are historically conditioned. On the German territory, Rheinau, this \\"piece of Alsace in Germany\\", is classified as unincorporated community. Due to the straightening of the Rhine in the first half of the 19th century and the first localization of a river main bed in the area, a change in the border between Germany and France was partially made. However, the changes in the course of the river bed (respectively beds - its arms) did not change ownership. Protected area Specifications The area was declared a nature reserve (NSG No. 3.108) on September 27, 1979, and was incorporated by legal ordinance from April 8, 1997 into the protected area number 3.233 by the regional council Freiburg. The nature reserve with an area of 1,697 hectares is classified in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) category IV. The CDDA code of the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is 165837. History The Upper Rhine Plain is originated about 35 million years ago as a result of a rift. Between Basel and Frankfurt, the surface of the earth sank and the today surrounding Vosges and the Black Forest emerged. The Rhine found its way from the Alps to the North Sea. Later, floodplains developed here. As part of the Revitalization of Taubergie√üen project from 2006 and the start of building activity in 2007, water channels were dug, passages built, bridges erected and older buildings redesigned. Revitalisierung Taubergie√üen, abgerufen am 26. November 2012 (PDF, 2,8 MB). These measures prevent further siltation of the areas, in particular at low water, increasing the stream velocity and ensuring more frequent flow. In 2008, Taubergie√üen was included in the Ramsar Convention.The List of Wetlands of International Importance ‚ÄûOberrhein / Rhin sup√©rieur‚Äú, abgerufen am 25. November 2012 (PDF, 896 KB). Flora and fauna Flora About 60% of the area is forested, the rest is used as grassland for agriculture. The extensive landscape is crossed by numerous watercourses. Rare orchids blossom here. Fauna The nature reserve, with its forests, meadows, purple moor grass meadows, dry calcareous grassland and flood dams, is a habitat for many endangered species.

The football series between the two universities dates back to 1902 and is the oldest rivalry in the Mid-American Conference (MAC), having begun five years before the Central Michigan‚ÄìWestern Michigan rivalry and six years before the Miami‚ÄìOhio rivalry. With 95 games having been played, it is also the most frequently-played series between MAC schools.Through the 2018 season, the most frequently played series between MAC schools are Central Michigan‚ÄìEastern Michigan (96 games), Miami‚ÄìOhio (95 games), and Central Michigan‚ÄìWestern Michigan (89 games). Michigan State Normal, as EMU was then known, dominated the series in the first 25 meetings, compiling a record of 14‚Äì8‚Äì3 from 1902 to 1936. The tide then shifted to CMU which compiled a 37‚Äì5‚Äì3 from 1937 to 1992. From 1993 to 2019, CMU has won 16 games to 11 for EMU. History=Early years: 1902‚Äì1939= The first game in the rivalry series was played on November 1, 1902, at Ypsilanti, Michigan. Central Michigan, under coach Charles Tambling, won the game by a 10‚Äì0 score. Eastern Michigan, then known as the Michigan State Normal School, achieved its first victory in the series on November 16, 1907. The Ypsilanti team won the game by a score of 38‚Äì0. The game was played starting at 9:30 a.m. to allow both teams to attend the Michigan‚ÄìMichigan Agricultural football game in Ann Arbor. On October 20, 1917, Michigan State Normal defeated Central by a score of 63 to 0 ‚Äì the largest margin of victory by either school in the rivalry's long history. The Detroit Free Press reported: \\"Mt. Pleasant failed to make a first down and gained only about 15 yards in the entire game, their team being light and lacking experience.\\" From 1925 to 1930, Michigan State Normal compiled a 40‚Äì4‚Äì2 record under head coach Elton Rynearson. Rynearson's teams won five consecutive games against Central during this period, outscoring Central by a total of 119 to 0. Michigan State Normal dominated the series in the first 25 meetings, compiling a record of 14‚Äì8‚Äì3 from 1902 to 1936. =Middle years: 1937‚Äì1992= From 1937 to 1992, the tide shifted heavily in Central Michigan's favor. During that period, Central compiled 37‚Äì5‚Äì3 record against Eastern Michigan. In November 1963, the teams terminated the rivalry due to Eastern Michigan's affiliation with the Presidents' Athletic Conference. At the time, the Detroit Free Press called it an \\"honored . . . rivalry\\" and \\"one of Michigan's all-time great collegiate football series.\\" Central Michigan won the 1963 game by a 55‚Äì20, leading the UPI to report: \\"A rivalry that began in 1902 ended somewhat inauspiciously . . .\\" After the longest break in the rivalry's history, lasting from 1964 to 1971, the teams met in October 1972 at the new Perry Shorts Stadium in Mount Pleasant. The 1972 match was also the 50th gridiron game between the two schools. Eastern defeated Central, 28‚Äì3, as Houston Booth threw three touchdown passes and George Duranko had a 100-yard interception return. In 1972, Central Michigan won the NCAA Division II championship and defeated Eastern by a score of 28‚Äì13. In 1979, Central Michigan won the Mid-America Conference championship, compiled an undefeated record, and defeated Eastern by a 37‚Äì14 score. =Modern era: 1992‚Äìpresent= From 1993 to 2017, the rivalry again became competitive. During that time, Central Michigan won 15 games to 10 for Eastern Michigan. Central Michigan coach Brian Kelly noted in 2005: \\"I think the rivalry's when two teams are very competitive. It wasn't much of a rivalry because I think Central had beaten Eastern for a number of years. Now Eastern obviously holds the upper hand . . . It creates a real rivalry situation . . . \\" In 1995, Charlie Batch, who went on to play in the NFL from 1998 to 2012, ran for three touchdowns and passed for 385 yards to lead Eastern Michigan to a 34-24 victory over Central Michigan. In 1996, Central Michigan came back from a 27-10 deficit in the second half to win by a 41-36 score. CMU receiver set a school record with 14 receptions for 241 yards. In 1997, Charlie Batch, playing in his final year of college football, threw three touchdown passes and ran for the winning touchdown as Eastern Michigan defeated Central Michigan, 31-24. In 2002, Central Michigan's Robbie Mixon broke the MAC single-game record with 377 rushing yards in a 47-21 victory over Eastern Michigan. In 2004, the teams played at Ford Field in Detroit. In the highest scoring game in the rivalry's history, Eastern Michigan defeated Brian Kelly's Central team by a 61‚Äì58 score in five-hour, quadruple overtime game. In 2005, the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame created the Michigan MAC Trophy awarded annually to the team with the best head-to-head record among Michigan's three Mid-American Conference programs ‚Äì Central Michigan, Eastern Michigan, and Western Michigan University. Since its inception, Central Michigan has won the Michigan MAC Trophy five times, and Eastern Michigan and Western Michigan have each won it four times. Days before the 2008 game, Eastern Michigan's head coach Jeff Genyk was fired. During pregame warmups, Central's coach Butch Jones approached one of the Eastern coaches to say \\"'I know you guys are out of a job and I'm not going to help you' with a few expletives thrown in there.\\" Jones' comments inspired the Eastern players who scored 42 points in the first half and won the game by a 56‚Äì52 score. Eastern's quarterback Andy Schmitt also broke Drew Brees' NCAA Division I-A record with 58 pass completions in the game. Genyk credited his team's performance to \\"the emotion of the rivalry.\\" In 2011, Ryan Radcliff led Central to two touchdowns and a two-point conversion in the last five-and-a-half minutes to tie the score at 28‚Äì28. Eastern Michigan then scored a touchdown with 37 seconds remaining to secure the win. After the game, Eastern coach Ron English said: \\"The one thing about rivalry games is you have to be able to win them in the end. There are tremendous highs and tremendous lows, but what happens is both sides usually keep playing because it means so much to everybody.\\" Game results See also  * List of NCAA college football rivalry games * Michigan MAC Trophy References College football rivalries in the United States Central Michigan Chippewas football Western Michigan Broncos football 1902 establishments in Michigan ","title":"Central Michigan‚ÄìEastern Michigan football rivalry"},{"id":"56524083","text":"Map of Antarctica showing outline of Ross Embayment The Ross Embayment is a large region of Antarctica, comprising the Ross Ice Shelf and the Ross Sea, that lies between East and West Antarctica. Extent The continent of Antarctica has two major divisions; West Antarctica in mostly west longitudes and East Antarctica in mostly east longitudes. East Antarctica is larger and has a higher average elevation. Separating the two subcontinents is a lower elevation topographic region occupied by the Ross Ice Shelf and the Ross Sea. This region is referred to as the Ross Embayment. The embayment comprises an area of approximately . It includes the Ross Sea () and the Ross Ice Shelf (as of 2013, ). The name is most commonly used in the scientific literature, at times along with the West Antarctic Rift System, which is of larger extent and has geologic meaning. Because the rift system includes the embayment, the later is considered to lie in West Antarctica. The informal use of the name 'Ross Embayment' tends to denote a smaller region than the rift system. The embayment extends from Northern Victoria Land and the Transantarctic Mountains on the west (in East Antarctica) to the Edward VII Peninsula, Shirase Coast and Siple Coast on the east (Marie Byrd Land in West Antarctica), and south to the grounding line of the Ross Ice Shelf. = Formation = MODIS).

Original file from Commons was image-enhanced. The low elevation marine characteristic of the Ross Embayment formed since the Jurassic period. Before that time and earlier East and West Antarctica had similar elevations and the Ross Embayment did not exist.BARRETT, P. J., D. H. ELLIOT, and J. F. LINDSAY (2013), The Beacon Supergroup (Devonian-Triassic) and Ferrar Group (Jurrasic) in the Beardmore Glacier Area, Antarctica, in Geology of the Central Transantarctic Mountains, edited by M. D. Turner and J. E. Splettstoesser, pp. 339-428, American Geopysical Union, doi:10.1029/AR036p0339. The breakup of the eastern sector of Gondwana in Cretaceous time resulted in crustal extension, thinning and subsidence to form the Ross Embayment. The mechanism of crustal stretching and subsidence in the Ross Embayment has been attributed to detachment faulting. Extension between East and West Antarctica totals about 500 kilometers. Half of this occurred prior to sea floor spreading that separated the New Zealand microcontinents (Zealandia) from Antarctica beginning at 85 million years. The remaining extension occurred in the Central Trough, Northern Basin, and Victoria Land Basin in the western Ross Sea before late Miocene time. Subsidence continued as mantle under the Ross Embayment cooled.

In 1826 John promulgated a Constitutional Charter, which provided for a bicameral parliament, the Cortes Gerais, with an elected Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Most Worthy Peers whose members were appointed by the monarch or were members of the nobility.Dieter Nohlen & Philip St√∂ver (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p1530 The Chamber of Deputies had 138 members; 120 from the mainland, 11 from islands and seven from overseas colonies. An electoral law was enacted on 7 August 1826, under which members of the Chamber of Deputies were elected from eight multi-member constituencies in which voters had as many votes as there were seats, as well as seven single-member constituencies for the colonial seats. The elections used a four-round system, with candidates required to receive a majority of the vote in the first three rounds to be elected, before the fourth round was held using plurality voting. The electoral franchise was more restrictive than in 1822, with new income and property requirements on top of the existing age limits, and the elections were held on an indirect basis, with voters electing provincial assemblies, who in turn elected members of the Chamber of Deputies. To vote for the provincial assemblies, the requirement was an income of 100,000 reals, but only those whose income was at least 200,000 could become members of the provincial assemblies. Membership of the Chamber of Deputies was restricted to those with an income of at least 400,000 reals. Results The result was a victory for the situationists, although the apostolic opposition boycotted the elections. Aftermath The new Cortes Gerais was opened on 30 October 1826. Although it was due to have a four-year term, it was dissolved on 13 March 1828 by Dom Miguel.

It was composed in 1902.  Composition  In 1902, when Stravinsky composed the piece, he was studying law at St. Petersburg University.Sadie, Stanley and Tyrrell, John (eds.) (2003). The New Grove Stravinsky, p. 3. Oxford University Press. Truslove, David (2008). Liner notes: Stravinsky: Piano Music. Naxos Records He met Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's son Vladimir there. At this time, Stravinsky's ambition was to become a composer, since his father, Fyodor Stravinsky, was also a successful bass opera singer, but studied law out of being pressured into it by his family. However, he started coming to Nikolai's house in order to learn composition and orchestration. Very few juvenalia works from this period still remain, but some of them, presumably the ones he kept in his portfolio, survived. This was the case for his Piano Sonata in F-sharp minor and, also, this scherzo. After composing just a handful of works in these years, Stravinsky would not produce anything significant, but continued to attend private classes with Rimsky- Korsakov until the latter's death in 1908. Stravinsky never mentioned the Scherzo specifically in any of his autobiographical writings. However, he made references to his early piano works in his conversations with Robert Craft. In Expositions and Developments, he described them simply as \\"andantes, melodies, and so forth\\".Stravinsky, Igor and Craft, Robert (1981). Expositions and Developments, pp. 44‚Äì45. University of California Press. (reprint of the 1959 edition) In Dialogues, Stravinsky noted that Rimsky-Korsakov's biographer had mentioned a 1903 concert of his pieces, but he stated \\"I have no recollection of these bagatelles\\".Stravinsky, Igor and Craft, Robert (1982). Dialogues, p. 133. University of California Press. (reprint of the 1961 edition) With the fall of the Russian Empire most of these early works were presumed to be lost or kept hidden somewhere. Stravinsky himself went to Russia many years later, but nobody seemed to know that the manuscripts of most of his early works were in the safekeeping of several public libraries in the Soviet Union. The manuscript score for the Scherzo was held in the Leningrad State Library in the archives of the pianist Nicholas Richter (1879‚Äì1944). Richter was an old acquaintance of Stravinsky and the dedicatee of the Scherzo. The first known publication of the score was a facsimile of the holograph which appeared in Valery Smirnov's 1970 book Tvorcheskoye formirovaniye I. F. Stravinskovo (The Formative years of I. F. Stravinsky). A facsimile version of the piece was also published by Faber Music in 1972, just a year after Stravinsky's death.Taruskin, Richard. (2016). Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions, Vol. 1, p. 100. University of California Press. The Scherzo did not receive any formal premiere. According to musicologist Charles M. Joseph, there has been speculation that it may have been performed privately for Rimsky-Korsakov in the summer of 1902 when Stravinsky was hoping to be accepted as his pupil. There is no evidence that Richter ever publicly performed the work, although he is known to have premiered the Piano Sonata in F sharp minor, another of Stravinsky's pieces which were dedicated to him.Joseph, Charles M. (January 1981). \\"Stravinsky's Piano Scherzo (1902) in Perspective: A New Starting Point\\", pp. 83‚Äì84. The Musical Quarterly, Vol. 67, No. 1. Retrieved 22 February 2018 .  Structure  This scherzo is scored for solo piano and has a duration of only two minutes. As is customary, the scherzo has an ABA structure and is in . The scherzo part itself starts in G minor, initially marked Allegro by Stravinsky, but later changed to Vivo, probably by Richter himself. The trio is marked Moderato and modulates to G major. During the recapitulation, the piece modulates again to G minor. It ends, after presenting the theme once more, with a short coda.

Holland was selected by Governor George Pataki to serve as Commissioner of the New York State Department of Housing and Community Renewal, a position he held from 1995 until his resignation in October 1996. Holland ran for Attorney General of New York in 1994 and 2018 and ran for Governor of New York in 2018; he has also run for New York State Senate. Early life and education One of ten children, Holland is the son of Laura Mitchell Holland and Jerome H. Holland, who served as the United States Ambassador to Sweden under President Richard Nixon. He received a B.A. and an M.A. from Cornell University. Holland played on the Cornell Big Red football squad. He became a member of the Academic Hall of FameAcademic All American 1978, College Sports Information Directors of America. and was president of the Quill and Dagger Society.The Cornell Daily Sun, 6 April 1979 Holland attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 1983. Political career A Republican, Holland served as co-chair of George Pataki's successful 1994 gubernatorial campaign. Following his 1994 victory, Gov. Pataki appointed Holland Commissioner of the New York State Department of Housing and Community Renewal. Holland held this position from 1995 until October 1996, when he resigned to \\"'focus on resolving outstanding personal business matters'\\" following \\"threats by creditors to [garnish] his state salary in a bid to enforce court judgments.\\" At the time, a spokesperson for Gov. Pataki stated that the Governor \\"accepted Holland's resignation 'regretfully'\\" and added that \\"'Commissioner Holland [had] served the state exceptionally well.'\\" Holland has run for New York State Senate; he also ran for Attorney General of New York in the 1994 Republican primary, but \\"dropped out of the race under pressure from GOP leaders to clear the way for Dennis Vacco, who won in November.\\" In early 2018, Holland announced that he was running for Governor of New York. Holland withdrew from the race on May 22, 2018 to instead run for Attorney General of New York. At the 2018 New York State Republican Party Convention, Holland gained enough votes to force a primary for the Attorney General post; however, he threw his support to the first-place finisher, Keith Wofford. Career outside politics According to The New York Times, Holland moved to Harlem in 1982; in the following decade, he opened a law office, \\"started and ran a 15-bed homeless shelter in a church basement, founded a drug rehabilitation program and acquired a travel agency. He also opened the first Ben & Jerry's store in Harlem and a soul food restaurant, staffing both with homeless-shelter residents\\". During the mid-1980s, Holland worked in Albany as Counsel to the New York State Senate Housing Committee. Following his stint as Commissioner of the New York Department of Housing and Community Renewal, Holland was a partner at the law firm of Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman & Dicker. Holland left that post to form Uptown Partners, a real estate development company that focused on housing in Harlem; he reportedly sought to \\"aid churches and nonprofit organizations by developing their underused properties, and encourage successful African-Americans to invest in blighted neighborhoods\\". One of his projects, the Uptown Grand restaurant, enmeshed him in a flood of accusations and counter-accusations with regard to the financing of the enterprise and conflicts with his partner Thomas Lopez-Pierre.Harlem Rumble, Amsterdam News, Cyril Josh Barker, January 17, 2013.

Being able to accurately identify pollen has a wide range of applications though it has been difficult in the past due to the limitations of microscopic identification of pollen. Pollen identified using DNA barcoding involves the specific targeting of gene regions that are found in most to all plant species but have high variation between members of different species. The unique sequence of base pairs for each species within these target regions can be used as an identifying feature. The applications of pollen DNA barcoding range from forensics, to food safety, to conservation. Each of these fields benefits from the creation of plant barcode reference libraries. These libraries range largely in size and scope of their collections as well as what target region(s) they specialize in. One of the main challenges of identifying pollen is that it is often collected as a mixture of pollen from several species. Metabarcoding is the process of identifying the individual species DNA from a mixed DNA sample and is commonly used to catalog pollen in mixed pollen loads found on pollinating animals and in environmental DNA (also called eDNA) which is DNA extracted straight from the environment such as in soil or water samples.  Advantages  Some of the principle constraints of microscopic identification are the expertise and time requirements. Identifying pollen via microscopy requires a high level of expertise in the pollen characteristics of the specific plants being studied. With expertise it can still be extremely difficult to identify pollen accurately with high taxonomic resolution. The skills required to do DNA barcoding are much more common making the approach easier to adopt. Pollen DNA barcoding is a technique that has grown in popularity due to the decreased costs associated with \\"next generation sequencing\\" (NGS) techniques and is being continually improved in efficiency including through the use of a dual-indexing approach. Some of the other major advantages include the savings in time and resources compared to microscopic identification. Identifying pollen is time-consuming, involving spreading pollen on a slide, staining the pollen to improve visibility, then focusing in on individual pollen grains and identifying them based on size, shape, as well as the shape and number of pores. If a pollen reference library is not available, then pollen has to be collected from wild specimens or from herbarium specimens and is then added to a pollen reference library. Rare plants visited by some pollinators can be difficult to determine, by using pollen DNA barcoding researchers can uncover \\"invisible\\" interactions between plants and pollinators.  Challenges  There are many challenges when it comes to genetic barcoding of pollen. The amplification process of DNA can mean that even small pieces of plant DNA can be detected included those from contaminants to a sample. Strict procedures to prevent contamination are important and can be facilitated by the hardiness of the pollen coat allowing the pollen to be washed of contaminants without damaging the internal pollen DNA. DNA barcode reference libraries are still being built and standardized target regions are being gradually adopted. These challenges are likely due to the newness of DNA barcoding and will likely improve with the wider adoption of DNA barcoding as a tool used by taxonomists. Determining the amount of each contributor to a mixed pollen load can be difficult to determine through the use of DNA barcoding. However, scientists have been able to compare pollen amounts via rank order. = Alternatives = Innovations in automated microscopy and imagining software offer one potential alternative in the identification of pollen. Through the use of pattern-recognition software, researchers have developed software that can characterize microscopic pollen images based on texture analyzes.  Target regions  There have been several different regions of plant DNA that have been used as targets for genetic barcoding including rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA, ITS1 and ITS2. A combination of rbcL and matK has been recommended for use in plant DNA barcoding. It has been found that trnL is better for degraded DNA and ITS1 is better for differentiating species within a genus.  Applications  Butterfly foraging for nectar from a flower in the Chinese Himalayas = Use in pollination networks = Being able to identify pollen is especially important in the study of pollination networks which are made up of all the interactions between plants and the animals that facilitate their pollination. Identifying the pollen carried on insects helps scientists understand what plants are being visited by which insects. Insects can also have homologous features making them difficult to identify and are themselves sometimes identified through genetic barcoding (usually of the CO1 region). Every insect that visits a flower is not necessarily a pollinator. Many lack features such as hairs allowing them to carry pollen while others avoid the pollen-laden anthers to steal nectar. Pollination networks are made more accurate by including what pollen is being carried by which insects. Some scientists argue that pollination effectiveness (PE), which is measured by studying the germination rates of seeds produced from flowers visited only once by a single animal, is the best way to determine which animals are important pollinators though other scientists have used DNA barcoding to determine the genetic origin of pollen found on insects and have argued that this in conjunction with other traits is a good indication of pollination effectiveness. By studying the composition and structure of pollination networks, conservationists can understand the stability of a pollination network and identify which species are most important and which are at most risk to perturbation leading to pollinator declines. Another advantage of pollen DNA barcoding is that it can be used to determine the source of pollen found on museum specimens of insects, and these records of insect-plant interactions can then be compared to modern-day interactions to see how pollination networks have changed over time due to global warming, land use change, and other factors. = Forensics = Being accurately able to identify pollen found on evidence helps forensic investigators identify which regions evidence originated from based on the plants that are endemic to those regions. In addition to this, atmospheric pollen originating from illegal cannabis farms were successfully detected by scientists which in the future could allow law enforcement officials to narrow down the search areas for illegal farms. = Ancient pollen = Due to the hardy structure of pollen which has evolved to survive being transported sometimes great distances while keeping the internal genetic information intact, the origin of pollen found mixed in ancient substrates can often be determined through DNA barcoding. = Food safety = Honeybees carry pollen as well as the nectar used in their production of honey. For food quality and safety concerns it is important to understand the plant providence of human-consumed bee products including honey, royal jelly, and pollen pellets. Investigators can test which plants honeybees foraged on and thus the origin of the nectar used in honey by collecting pollen packets from honeybees' corbicular loads and identify the pollen via DNA metabarcoding.

Prostitution occurs on the streets, in bars, brothels and in logging, mining, and palm oil areas. In 2010 it was estimated there were 2.000 prostitutes in the capital, Port Moresby. The drought in 2016 caused a rise in prostitution. Many of the women have turned to sex work due to poverty or unemployment. HIV, sex trafficking and child prostitution are problems in Papua New Guinea. Legal situation The legal situation in Papua New Guinea is complex. The Summary Offences Act 1977 makes keeping a brothel and living on the earnings of prostitution offences. The idea of the law was to decriminalise prostitution but criminalise those who sought to exploit or profit from it. In 1978, a Papua New Guinea court interpreted ‚Äòliving on the earnings of prostitution‚Äô to include 'profit from one's own prostitution'. (Wemay v Tumdual) The ruling effectively made all prostitution illegal. In a further case it was ruled that \\"occasional transactional sex for small amounts of money was insufficient to warrant a conviction\\". This may be a unique legal situation in that prostitution is made illegal not by Statute law but by case law. In rural areas, 'customary law' is also in force. These laws are not written down, but are based on the knowledge of the laws of the indigenous peoples. There have been calls to legalise prostitution. In October 2016, a private member's Bill was introduced to Parliament by the Member for Sumkar, Ken Fairweather, to instigate legalisation. Prime Minister Peter O'Neill and Oro Governor Gary Juffa said they would oppose any call for legalisation. Law enforcement Law enforcement is inconsistent. Sex workers and NGOs report corruption amongst police. There also report violence, intimidation, abuse, extortion and rape at the hands of the police. Knowingly transmitting HIV contrary to the HIV/AIDS Management and Prevention Act (HAMP) Act 2003 is sometimes used to detain sex workers, but there is no evidence of any charges being brought under this legislation. HIV The country has the highest HIV prevalence in the Pacific. Sex workers are one of the high risk groups, although HIV response in the country is now being directed towards the high risk groups. Access to healthcare is poor for sex workers. UNAIDS estimated an HIV prevalence of 17.8% amongst sex workers in 2016. Sex trafficking Papua New Guinea is a source, transit, and destination country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Foreign and local women and children are subjected to sex trafficking, including near logging, mining, and palm oil sites. ‚ÄúMosko Girls‚Äù, young girls employed in bars to provide companionship to patrons and sell an alcoholic drink called mosko, are vulnerable to human trafficking, especially around major cities. Within the country, children and women from rural areas are deceived, often by relatives, with promises of legitimate work or education to travel to different provinces where they are subjected to sex trafficking. NGOs report some parents receive money from traffickers who exploited their teenage daughters in prostitution, including near mining and logging sites. Children, including girls as young as 5 years old from remote rural areas, are reportedly subjected to sex trafficking by members of their immediate family or tribe. Tribal leaders reportedly trade with each other the service of girls and women for guns and to forge political alliances. Young girls sold into polygamous marriages may be exploited in prostitution. In urban areas, parents reportedly exploit their children in sex trafficking directly or in brothels as a means to support their families or to pay for school fees. Government officials reportedly facilitate trafficking by accepting bribes to allow undocumented migrants to enter the country or ignore trafficking situations, and some may exploit sex trafficking victims or procure victims for other individuals in return for political favours or votes. Malaysian and Chinese logging companies arrange for some foreign women to enter the country voluntarily with fraudulently issued tourist or business visas. After their arrival, many of these women, from countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, China, and the Philippines, are turned over to traffickers who transport them to logging and mining camps, fisheries, and entertainment sites, and exploit them in forced prostitution.

It is significant as the last surviving Black Canadian community in New Brunswick.Hodges, Graham Russell (1996). The Black Loyalist Directory. New York: Garland Publishing Inc. History Elm Hill was established by black Loyalists from Virginia in 1806, as one of Canada's earliest black communities. Throughout the 1800s, the community enjoyed a period of relative prosperity, as its remoteness allowed the residents to develop their economy free from outside interference. Located on the St. John River between Saint John and Fredericton, Elm Hill functioned well while the steamers plied the river, stopping there to transport people and products. Once the railroad replaced the river as the highway, however, the community's isolation worked against it. Elm Hill had been a self-sufficient farming community until the 1960s, when many area residents moved to urban areas for better opportunities. Those remaining were not able to keep up the farms, and decline set in. Elm Hill once supported a post office, a store, two churches (Pentecostal and Baptist), and a school although those are all now closed. As of the 2016 census, the area is still home to 25 residents, many involved in small-scale farming operations or employed in government jobs. The community was previously known as Otnabog (1854‚Äì1893), Upper Otnabog (1876‚Äì1911), and Pleasant Villa (1911‚Äì1933), before the name was changed back to Elm Hill.

The Vale Royal chronicler praises Abbot Richard in the same tones he had Richard's predecessor. He certainly had a reputation for religious devotion; but these were troubled times on at least two accounts. Firstly, a period of national famine began the same year as his election. Further, he faced the same, continuing, local disorder from a seething populace as his predecessors had. This dispute had been ongoing since the 1270s, and generally coalesced around the Abbot of Vale Royal's tenantry denouncing their Abbot as a cruel and unscrupulous landlord, and their concomitant rejection of his claims to feudal lordship over them. By Abbot Richard's time, this had increased in bitterness on his tenantry's behalf that on one occasion, whilst travelling around the villages collecting the Church's tithes, he was personally attacked. And 1320 saw not just further violence but bloodshed: one of the Abbey's monks was assaulted in Tarvin, and in Darnhall, a servant of Abbot Richard was killed. In this particularly barbarous episode, having killed the man, the malefactors cut his head off and played football with it.

It was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places on 31 March 1931. History The house was built in 1769 for master stonemason Johan Friedrich Lohmann. Born in Hannover, Lohmann had come to Denmark in c. 1760 where he initially worked for royal stone carver Jacob Fortling. He became licensed as a master stone carver in 1766. Lohman worked at the Royal Frederik Stone Quarry on Bornholm from 1779 but died the following year. The writer Carl Brosb√∏ll, better known under his pseudonym Carit Etlar, lived in the building as a student in 1848-49. Architecture Ny Kongensgade consists of three floors over a cellar and is five bays wide. A side wing, probably from the 1770s, extends from the rear side of the building. A three-bay rear wing from 1813 was built for timber merchant Andreas Collstrup. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places on 31 March 1931.

This woolly aphid has the distinction of being the first species of aphid to have been identified as having a \\"soldier\\" caste. First instar nymphs of this type are able to protect the aphid colony, killing the larvae of predatory ladybirds, hoverflies and the flower bug Anthocoris nemoralis. Description The aphids and nymphs are grey in colour with tufts of white extruded wax. There are two forms of first instar nymphs. The primary-type nymphs have long rostra and legs of approximately equal length; they feed and continue to grow and develop into adults. The secondary- type nymphs have short rostra and the front two pairs of legs are enlarged; they have never been known to grow beyond the first instar stage. Ecology The deciduous, three-leaf clematis Clematis apiifolia is used during the summer by C. clematis as its secondary host species. The aphids form a cluster in a shady area near the base of the climbing plant. During the summer, wingless females produce primary-type nymphs by parthenogenesis (live birth). These also reproduce parthogenetically, but some of the offspring develop into secondary-type nymphs. These neither grow nor develop further and guard the colony, killing predatory larvae of ladybirds, hoverflies and the flower bug Anthocoris nemoralis. To do this, the secondary-type nymphs climb onto the intruder and some insert their stylets into it. The intruder wriggles and falls to the ground where it is further attacked by walking secondary-type nymphs and dies within a few hours. In the autumn some winged adult aphids are produced which migrate to an unknown primary host plant. In late autumn only primary-type first instar nymphs are produced and these overwinter in cracks in the bark or among moss. It is not known whether these are the source of the following year's colonies, or whether the migratory insects are. Further research has disclosed that the primary host for this social aphid is a plant in the family Ulmaceae, often Zelkova. On this host the aphids form galls and some of the second instar nymphs form a soldier caste. The proportion of soldiers is higher in large colonies on the primary host, and the soldier nymphs differ from those on the secondary host in being capable of moulting and developing into adults.

He is the Paul Licht Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley and the Founding Director of the Shanghai-based Institute of Neuroscience (ION) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the 2016 Gruber Prize in Neuroscience for his pioneering work on synaptic plasticity. At ION, Poo led a team of scientists that produced the world's first truly cloned primates, a pair of crab-eating macaques called Zhongzhong and Huahua in 2017, using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT).  Early life  Poo was born in Nanjing, Jiangsu, China on October 31, 1948. When he was one, his family moved to Taiwan because of the Chinese Communist Revolution. Influenced by his father, an aeronautical engineer, he was interested in physics from a young age. He attended National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan, graduating with a degree in physics in 1970. Career in the US In 1970, he went to the United States to pursue graduate studies at Johns Hopkins University, where he became interested in biophysics. Under the guidance of Richard Cone, he developed the now widely used method to determine the kinetics of diffusion through cells, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. His research was published in the major journal Nature in 1974. After earning his PhD, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Purdue University, and became an assistant professor at the University of California, Irvine in 1976. He developed a new method to manipulate proteins in cell membranes called \\"in situ electrophoresis\\". In 1985, he moved to the Yale School of Medicine to conduct research in proteins and synapses. Later he became a professor at Columbia University and then at the University of California, San Diego in 1996. During this period he made significant discoveries in molecular neurobiology that developed into a new study area on neurotrophins. Poo and his colleagues also invented a new method called the \\"growth cone turning assay\\", now widely in neuroscience for measuring axon growth in reaction to proteins. He moved to the University of California, Berkeley in 2000, where he later became Paul Licht Distinguished Professor in Biology. At Berkeley, he made many new discoveries in understanding the factors that determine the development of axons and dendrites in neurons. He also made important discoveries in synaptic plasticity, demonstrating that spike-timing-dependent plasticity plays a crucial role in neuron connections. Career in China In 1999, Poo co-founded the Shanghai-based Institute of Neuroscience (ION) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and served as its director. For the following decade, he commuted frequently between Berkeley and Shanghai, until the constant traveling took a toll and he decided to focus on his work in Shanghai. He is now a professor emeritus at UC Berkeley. In 2017, he gave up his American citizenship, which he had acquired in the 1980s, and regained his Chinese citizenship. At ION, Poo led a team of Chinese scientists that produced the world's first truly cloned primates, a pair of crab-eating macaques called Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua in late 2017, using somatic cell nuclear transfer (the technique used to create Dolly the sheep) rather than embryo twinning. According to Poo, the principal significance of this event is that it could be used to create genetically identical monkeys for use in animal experiments. Crab-eating macaques are already an established model organism for studies of atherosclerosis, though Poo chose to emphasize neuroscience, naming Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease when he appeared on the radio news program All Things Considered in January 2018.* Poo compares his career to a \\"random walk\\": \\"When I bump into an interesting problem, I work on it for as long as I can contribute. Then I move on.\\"  Honors and awards  Poo is a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Academia Sinica of Taiwan, and the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences. In 2016, he was awarded the $500,000 Gruber Prize in Neuroscience for his \\"pioneering and inspiring work on synaptic plasticity\\". He is also the recipient of the following awards: * Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS, 2001) * Ameritec Prize (2001) * Ray Wu Society Award (2002) * Honorary Doctoral Degree, √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, Paris (2003) * National Prize for International Cooperation, China (2005) * Qiushi Excellent Scientist Award, China (2010) * Outstanding Science and Technology Achievement Prize, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2011) * Honorary Doctoral Degree, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (2014)  Personal life  Poo married a fellow Taiwanese immigrant to the US, chemist and oncologist Wen-jen Hwu, and they later divorced. They have two daughters: Ting and Ai-jen. Ai-jen Poo (born 1974) is a social activist and writer who won the MacArthur \\"Genius\\" Award in 2014. Ting Poo is a filmmaker who was the editor of Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405, which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) in 2017. Poo married again, to Yang Dan, his former student at Columbia University. Dan is also a distinguished neuroscientist who was elected to the US National Academy of Sciences in 2018.

Macadam was also an important figure in the professional development of social work.  Early life  Elizabeth Macadam was born on 10 October 1871, in the village of Chryston outside Glasgow. Her father, Revd Thomas Macadam, was a minister in the Free Church of Scotland, and her mother, his wife, was Elizabeth Whyt. Macadam spent part of her childhood in Canada. Her father served as the minister of St Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Strathroy, Ontario. He later became professor of political philosophy at Morrin College, in Quebec City. Following the death of her mother and the retirement of her father, Elizabeth and her sister Margaret returned to Scotland as young women.  Career  In the late nineteenth century, Macadam spent time in Germany where she worked in a kindergarten. In 1898 Macadam was awarded a Pfeiffer scholarship and trained in social work at the Women's University Settlement in Southwark, London. During the four years that she spent at the settlement, Macadam helped to run an evening school for approximately hundred adolescent boys and girls. Macadam served as the warden of the Victoria Women's Settlement in Liverpool, between 1902 and 1910. In this position, she worked alongside Eleanor Rathbone, with whom she would subsequently become close friends. = Development of social work = Macadam was a strong advocate for the professional development of social work. In 1904 the Victoria Women's Settlement in Liverpool began a training programme for social workers. This included lectures on poverty, child welfare, and civic administration. These courses were complemented by opportunities for practical work experience with municipal and voluntary associations. In 1910 Liverpool University took over the running of this programme. Macadam was the first lecturer on the methods and practice of social work. By 1914, more than 100 students were enrolled on the course. = First World War = In 1916, and at the request of the Ministry of Munitions, Macadam helped to devise training courses for welfare workers. = Inter-war = In 1919, Macadam left Liverpool permanently for London. She became secretary of the newly established Joint University Council for Social Studies. In the same year, Rathbone became president of the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (NUSEC). Macadam became an NUSEC officer and was involved in editing its paper, the Woman's Leader. Macadam also supported Rathbone in campaigning for family allowances.  Personal life  At the end of the First World War, Macadam and Eleanor Rathbone bought a house in London together. The two friends continued to share the house until Rathbone's sudden death in January 1946. Following the death of Rathbone, Macadam returned to Edinburgh where she spent the rest of her life. Macadam died of cancer on 25 October 1948.

In the recent past, B Studios has financed several of Bala's directorial ventures, and other films by filmmakers including Mysskin and Sarkunam.  History  In September 2004, director Bala revealed that he had launched his own production house, B Studios, to \\"give opportunity for new talent\\", especially for his own assistants. He announced his intentions of producing two films a year and also venturing into ad films. Subsequently, the first venture was Maayavi (2005) directed by Singampuli, a comedy film starring Suriya and Jyothika in the lead roles. As a result of their association in Naan Kadavul in late 2005, B Studios agreed to produce Ajith Kumar's Paramasivan (2006), but later opted out. B Studios were also briefly involved with the production of Vishnuvardhan's Sarvam (2009) during June 2006, when the film was announced with Suriya and Ileana D'Cruz in the lead roles. Initially planned as a co-production with Studio Green, the film failed to progress and was released with different makers and a different cast in 2009. Following the release of Naan Kadavul in early 2009, Bala announced that he would finance another film with Suriya for director Singampuli and a film with Jayam Ravi for Aacharya Ravi, but neither materialised.

He has spent years lobbying to draw attention to the plight of the Pashtun people, especially those from Waziristan and other parts of the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan. He is the chairman of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (\\"Pashtun Protection Movement\\"). Pashteen has accused Pakistan's army of human rights abuses and was arrested for the same reason in January 2020. Early life and education Pashteen was born in 1994 in Shahur (or Shaheer), Mawle Khan Sarai, a small village near the town of Sarwakai in South Waziristan, Pakistan. The eldest of eight siblings, Pashteen belongs to the Shamankhel Mahsud tribe of the Pashtuns. His father, Abdul Wadud Mahsud, is a primary school teacher at his village. Pashteen received his early education at his village's school in South Waziristan. In 2005, because of military offensives by the Pakistan Armed Forces against militants, Pashteen and his family were flee to Waziristan and temporarily settle in IDP camps in Dera Ismail Khan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The family fled their home in Waziristan for the second time in 2007, and returned in 2008, but fled again in 2008 due to Operation Zalzala. In 2009, because of Operation Rah-e-Nijat, he and his family were forced to flee Waziristan for the fourth time. Pashteen completed his secondary education at Army Public School in Bannu and higher secondary education in Karak. His father was determined to ensure his education. \\"Only I know\\", Pashteen said, \\"my father borrowed money for my schooling and only I know how much we have suffered\\". Pashteen received his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree in 2016 at Gomal University, Dera Ismail Khan. He and his family returned to Waziristan in 2016. They found that their books had been plundered, their house ruined, landmines scattered over their lands and they were humiliated at Pakistan Army checkpoints. In May 2014, during his studies at Gomal University, Pashteen founded the \\"Mahsud Tahafuz Movement\\", a social movement mainly focused on removing landmines from Waziristan (especially Mahsud land). On 5 September 2017, Pashteen and his father, along with a couple of other human rights activists, Jamal Malyar and Shah Faisal Ghazi, were detained by the security forces of Pakistan at Barwand check post in Tiarza Tehsil, South Waziristan. Pashteen was beaten up under the allegation that his human rights campaign damaged military morale. ‚ÄúI said, you are building your morale by killing innocent children and then calling us terrorists,‚Äù Pashteen later told. As a result of the social media campaign for them by their supporters, they were released on 6 September by the military. Pashtun Long March On January 26, 2018, Pashteen along with 20 friends started a protest march from Dera Ismail Khan. Many people joined the march along the way, and it reached Peshawar on January 28. Then upon reaching Islamabad on February 1, the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement organized a sit-in called \\"All Pashtun National Jirga\\". The jirga condemned the murder of the Pashtun shopkeeper Naqeebullah Mehsud who was shot dead by police force in Karachi during a fake encounter. Among other demands, the jirga also asked the government to set up a judicial inquiry for Naqeebullah Mehsud, as well as for all the other Pashtuns murdered extrajudicially in police encounters.

In 1971, the bridge was designated a category A listed building. History Before the bridge was constructed, a ford approximately 100m upstream served as the crossing of the Tyne at East Linton. On the site of the current bridge was an earlier structure. On 7 September 1547, English infantry under the command of the Duke of Somerset crossed the Tyne on this bridge. Two years later in September 1549 the bridge was destroyed by French troops to delay the English retreat from the siege of Haddington. On 31 March 1560, Lord Grey, with an English force wrote from \\"Linton-Briggs\\", saying \\"we are now at Lintern (sic) Briggis etc\\".https://scotlandsplaces.gov.uk/digital- volumes/rcahms-archives/inventories/east-lothian-1924/187 Therefore the current bridge was probably built circa 1560 at the latest. Numerous repairs have been carried out carried out, including in 1625, 1639, 1661, 1763 and 1934. In the course of the work in 1763, the bridge was probably widened. The Edinburgh to Berwick-upon-Tweed post road, later to become the A1, crossed the Tyne on this bridge until 1927 when a new bypass and bridge were constructed upstream. The old A1 road is now re-classified as the A199. Description The 30m long and 5.7m wide masonry viaduct is located on the southern edge of the village. It spans the river with two segmental arches with spans of 12.2m. The masonry consists of roughly carved red and yellow sandstone, which was built into a layered masonry with bricked arches. The central pillar is equipped with a triangular protruding cutwater. The bridge has architectural parallels to the Abbey Bridge in Haddington. The delimiting balustrade was raised around 1895.

E. Beauchamp; 14 June 1825 ‚Äì 1903) was an English-born American educator and author. She wrote about the Haudenosaunee, and served as secretary for her younger brother, William Martin Beauchamp, the ethnologist. Her notable works include Handbook of Wells Cathedral (1856) and The Emigrant's Quest (1867). Early years and education Mary Elizabeth Beauchamp was born in Butleigh in the English county of Somerset on 14 June 1825. The family removed to the United States in 1829, establishing themselves in Coldenham, Orange County, New York. In 1832, they removed to Skaneateles, New York, where Mr. Beauchamp went into the book business, to which seven years later he united a printing office and the publication of a weekly newspaper. In 1834, he established a circulating library of nearly a thousand volumes, which was very successful for many years. His daughter had free range of its carefully selected volumes and early acquired a familiarity with the best writers of the English language. The little girl wrote rhymes when she was ten years old, acrostics for her schoolmates and wildly romantic ballads. Before she entered her teenage years, she had become a regular contributor to a juvenile magazine, for which, at the age of fourteen, she furnished a serial running through half a volume. Career From her teens, she wrote under various pen-names for several papers and achieved the honor of an illustrated tale in Peterson's Magazine before she was twenty. Then her literary career was checked by ill-health, and for ten years, she wrote little. What she published during that time appeared in religious papers under the pen-name \\"Filia Ecclesia,\\" and some of these pieces found their way into contemporary collections of sacred poetry. In 1853, accompanied by a younger brother, she visited England, where she remained nearly two years. At the desire of her uncle, a vicar in Wells, she prepared a Handbook of Wells Cathedral , which was published in different styles with illustrations. After returning home, she wrote a series of papers entitled \\"The Emigrant's Quest\\" which attracted attention for a year and were republished in a volume some years later. Beauchamp wrote letters, poems, and stories for the Baldwinsville Gazette, Churchman, Family (Troy, New York), Gospel Messenger, Journal, Living Church, and Skaneateles Democrat. Her mother died in 1859, and the death of her father in 1867 broke up her home in Skaneateles. In the ensuing year, she took the position of teacher in the orphan ward of the Church Charity Foundation, in Buffalo, New York, remaining there twelve years. In 1879, she went to Europe for a year accompanied by a woman who had been associated with her in church work. Soon after returning to the U.S., Beauchamp learned that the Mission of the Protestant Episcopal Church to the Onondaga people was in temporary need of a teacher. She offered her services and was delighted with the work. She next purchased a residence in Skaneateles, where she conducted a school for the children of summer residents, organized a literary society for young ladies, and had adult pupils in French and drawing. She took her full share in parochial and missionary work and wrote for religious papers. In March, 1890, she was prostrated for some months by cerebral hemorrhage, and thereafter resided with a married sister in Skaneateles. The Emigrant's Quest; or, \\"Is it our own Church?\\" The Emigrant's Quest; or, \\"Is it our own Church?\\" was published by \\"M. E. Beauchamp\\" (New York general Protestant episcopal Sunday-school union and church book society, 1867, 92 pages). It was characterized as an \\"unpretending\\", tiny volume. The publisher, acknowledging that it did not have personal knowledge of the author, stated that Beauchamp could have rendered a much larger work. The story purports to be that of an English emigrant belonging to the Anglican Church, whom an avaricious landlord had forced to abandon the home of his ancestors and emigrate to the U.S.. The unfeeling conduct of the landlord; the grief of the family at having been dispossessed merely because the lease happened to expire; their parting with their friends, and so forth were each portrayed by \\"Mr. Beauchamp\\" with considerable pathos. Having arrived in the U.S., the emigrant, his wife, and young daughter attend different Episcopal churches in New York. They compared what they saw and heard to what they had been used to in attending church in England. Some of the criticisms thus made were piquant; but in general, they were true. It thus afforded illustrations of the defects of two systems widely different from each other, but each highly characteristic of England.

She was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 10 January 1944 after she died of wounds from rescuing soldiers in a burning hospital in Kiev on 6 November 1943.  Civilian life  Pushina was born on 13 November 1923 as the ninth child to a Ukrainian peasant family in Turkmachi, Udmurtia within the Soviet Union. Her family moved the district of Izh-Zabegalovsky, where they worked as farmers, which was where Pushina attended school and spent most of her childhood. The village she grew up in did not have a school locally, so she had to attend the Bolshoi-Oshvartsinskaya school in a nearby village, where most of her peers were male. After graduating from school in 1939 she entered paramedic courses in Izhevsk, the capital of the Udmurtia region, despite several members of her family not approving of her career choice. After graduating from medical school she was assigned in January 1942 to work in Feldsher-Obstetric office in Kekoran village, where she took on tasks ranging from pediatrics to obstetrics.  Military career  After the start of the Second World War, Pushina joined the Red Army in April 1942. After undergoing further medical training she was sent to the front lines of the war in August that year assigned to the 20th Rifle Regiment of the 167th Rifle Division in the 38th Army on the 1st Ukrainian Front. On 7 February 1943 she managed to rescue 45 wounded soldiers from the battlefield through mortar attacks and artillery fire in Kursk. On 11 February, she treated the injuries of 57 wounded soldiers at a medical station with no Soviet defensive units nearby. For doing so, the commander of the 520th Rifle Regiment nominated her to be awarded the Medal \\"For Battle Merit\\" but his nomination was overruled by the head of the 167th Infantry Division, General Ivan Melnikov awarded her the Order of the Red Star, a higher-ranking order, instead. In the Battle of Kiev, Pushina treated the injured in a hospital in Svyatoshino, a suburb of the city. On the morning of 6 November German bombers launched an air raid on the town, with one of the bombs dropped hitting the hospital. Pushina and another member of the unit, Nikolai Kopyotyonkov ran into the burning building to rescue the wounded soldiers from the fire, in which Pushina rescued over 30 soldiers. When the building began to collapse she attempted to run in to save more soldiers but Kopyotyonkov held her back, preventing her from entering. She sustained severe injuries including burns and head trama, and died in Kopyotyonkov's arms later that day. Kopyotyonkov sustained severe burns as well but returned to the military in 1944 after recovering and remained in the military until 1962. Both Pushina and Kopyotyonkov were awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 10 January 1944.

This includes characters, plot lines, and/or themes portraying bisexual behavior in both men and women. Fiction that falls into this category may be of any genre, such as historical fiction, science fiction, fantasy, horror, and romance.  Overview  Bisexual literature includes works that feature bisexuality as the main plot point, as well as works with major bisexual characters. Though bisexuality has appeared in literary works as early as 1748, in John Cleland's Fanny Hill, the mid-1990s marked a rise in publications about bisexuality, often at the influence of the new appearance of bisexual organizations. Much of this work was a response to bisexuality's absence from the historical record and from the contemporary moment. A result of this is the attempts of contemporary accounts to legitimize bisexuality as a sexual identity. Much of bisexual literature focuses on \\"highlighting bisexuality's presence in history, the specificity of bisexual experiences, and its existence as a viable form of sexual identification\\". Though there are notable examples of both men and women expressing interest in both genders romantically and sexually in early literary works, the recent catalyst of gay rights movements inspired a surge of more LGBT literature. Though most of these literary works focused on lesbian and gay relationships, bisexuality is slowly making a rise and becoming more visible in literature and individuals.  History = Pre-1900 = One of the earliest known examples of bisexuality in literature is Fanny Hill by John Cleland. In the novel, the titular character Fanny has \\"exciting and satisfying sexual relations with other women as well as with men.\\" During this time period, homosexuality was considered an action rather than part of an identity, and so instances of any homosexuality, including bisexuality, were rare in literary works. A more famous example of characters implied to be bisexual includes Dorian Gray and supporting characters from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. Wilde himself was married with children but was understood by his contemporaries to have had extra-marital relationships with both women and men. Sometime after the publication of The Picture of Dorian Gray, Wilde was summoned to court on accusations of gross indecency for his portrayal of homosexual overtones and rumors about his own gay relationships. In modern adaptations of the story, Dorian is often portrayed as bisexual. Kate Chopin's The Awakening portrays Edna Pontellier, who is shown to have \\"capable of responding physically to a woman and of loving women\\" despite having numerous sexual relationships with men. Though her main character's sexuality is never explicitly stated, Chopin knew or read about homosexuality and bisexuality in the works of authors such as American poet Walt Whitman or French story writer Guy de Maupassant, and this likely influenced her character's sexual ambiguity. = 1900s = The 1900s saw an increase in bisexual literature, although not by much, as many authors followed the trend of addressing radical and controversial topics in their writing. In 1926, Richard Bruce Nugent published his experimental form short story \\"Smoke, Lilies, and Jade\\", which describes the struggle of a man understanding his attraction to multiple people, particularly a man he nicknames as \\"Beauty\\". Nevertheless, however, the early part of this era, much like the last, saw a lack of recognizing or misidentifying bisexuality in literature. Gore Vidal was a notable author, essayist, and public intellectual who identified as bisexual and wrote The City and the Pillar, the 1948 novel that described bisexuality as the \\"natural\\" human state. Bisexual characters also appeared in the novels of key figure and African-American author, James Baldwin, specifically his 1956 novel Giovanni's Room. Although the 1960s showed accomplishments for bisexuals in building the LGBT rights movement of the time, there was little addition to bisexual literature. Some novels, such as Stranger in a Strange Land and The Left Hand of Darkness portrayed characters as races without gender or a clear gender, who were bisexual as a result. This concept continued through more novels in the following years. During the 1970s, bisexuals gained more recognition in media, and as a result, there were many publications on the nature of bisexuality. Both Time and Newsweek magazines ran stories on \\"bisexual chic,\\" drawing mainstream attention to bisexuality. As a result, there were more appearances of bisexuality in literature. In 1976, the first of Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles was published, and the series portrayed several main characters as bisexual or biromantic. In the 1980s, the bisexual movement shifted toward receiving greater recognition. Activists worked to distinguish bisexuality from sexual swinging. One of the reasons mainstream media had this misperception is novels and literature rarely identified bisexuality even while portraying it. Often it is only implied that a character is bisexual rather than shown or explicitly stated. Towards the end of the decade, the mainstream press released some stories concerning the \\"AIDS threat bisexuals posed to heterosexuals.\\" In the 1990s, bisexual literature became more prominent. The USA's first national bisexual quarterly magazine, Anything That Moves: Beyond The Myths Of Bisexuality, founded by Karla Rossi, was first published in 1991 by the Bay Area Bisexual Network. One of the most influential books in the history of the modern bisexual rights movement, Bi Any Other Name: Bisexual People Speak Out, an anthology edited by Loraine Hutchins and Lani Ka'ahumanu, was also published in 1991. BiNet USA led a campaign after multiple bisexual works of literature were forced to compete in the lesbian categories of the Lambda Literary Awards. In 1995, Harvard Shakespeare professor Marjorie Garber argued the academic case most people would be bisexual if not for \\"repression, religion, repugnance, denial, laziness, shyness, lack of opportunity, premature specialization, a failure of imagination, or a life already full to the brim with erotic experiences, albeit with only one person, or only one gender\\" with her book Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life. In 1994, a monthly print journal called Bi Community News began publishing in the UK. In 1997, bisexual activist Dr. Fritz Klein founded the Journal of Bisexuality, the first academic, quarterly journal on bisexuality. However, other media proved more mixed in terms of representing bisexuals. = 2000s to the present = At the beginning of the 21st century, bisexuality continued to be overshadowed by gay and lesbian literature despite the progressive burst of LGBT literature. While many of the examples of bisexuality in literature during this time are still science-fiction and fantasy, taking place in a world where opinions on sexuality are different from societal norms, in more recent years bisexuality has started to appear more in contemporary fiction. The 2000s also saw the rise of LGBTQ+ YA literature, since teen novels presented a platform for coming of age stories, and thus coming out stories. In 2014, Bisexuality: Making the Invisible Visible in Faith Communities by Marie Alford-Harkey and Debra W. Haffner, the first book of its kind, was published.

Many publishers specializing in LGBTQ fiction, rather than specifically gay or lesbian fiction, have strong commitments to producing bisexual literature. The following is an incomplete list of publishers that have been recognized by the bisexual community for producing quality bisexual content. = Less than Three Publishers = Winner of the 2016 and 2015 Bisexual Book Awards' Publisher of the Year. LT3 is a growing publisher in the LGBTQ romance community. With a network of highly talented editors, artists, and writers, LT3 is dedicated to providing quality fiction that put substance first. = Bisexual Resource Center = The Bisexual Resource Center is a 501 non-profit educational organization headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, that has served the Bisexual Community since 1985. It tied for the 2014 Bisexual Book Awards' Publisher of the Year. = Circlet Press = Circlet Press is a publishing house in Cambridge, in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. It was founded by Cecilia Tan, who is also its manager. It specializes in science fiction erotica, a once uncommon genre, and its publications often feature BDSM themes. It tied for the 2014 Bisexual Book Awards' Publisher of the Year. = Riverdale Avenue Books = Riverdale was named 2014 BiPublisher of the Year by the Bi-Writers Association and won the 2013 Bisexual book Awards' Publisher of the Year. Its imprint, Riverdale/Magnus, is an award-winning imprint of LGBT titles. = Lethe Press = Lethe Press is an independent publishing house specializing in speculative fiction and books of queer interest. It tied in the 2012 Bisexual Book Awards' Publisher of the Year. = Riptide Publishing = Riptide Publishing is a publisher of LGBTQ fiction created by industry veterans and LGBTQ authors. It seeks to integrate positive LGBTQ representation into mainstream media. It tied for the 2012 Bisexual Book Awards' Publisher of the Year. = Sibling Rivalry Press = Sibling Rivalry Press is an inclusive publishing house specializing in LGBTQ authors and artists. It was founded in 2010 by Bryan Borland and based in Little Rock, Arkansas. It is the only press to ever win Lambda Literary Awards in both Gay Poetry and Lesbian Poetry. It tied for the 2012 Bisexual Book Awards' Publisher of the Year.  Children's and young adult fiction  There is a notable lack of children or early reader books that discuss bisexuality, though there are numerous other LGBT-centric books, primarily featuring homosexual relationships and parents. Over the past 30 years, the number of books written in English for children and young people that portray lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and otherwise queer (LGBT) characters has increased exponentially. However, the few bisexual characters appearing in literature meant for young readers are often portrayed negatively and under- analyzed. In a 2014 article for the Journal of Bisexuality, author B. J. Epstein analyzed several children's books to find \\"bisexuality is apparently still beyond acceptable and 'normal'.\\" Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, most of the books with LGBT characters were picture books, aimed at young children and portraying the LGBT characters as parents. In more recent years, LGBT characters have increasingly been included in books for older children and young adults. The characters are now not just parents, but young people themselves. One of the reasons it is difficult to identify bisexuals in children's literature is the tendency to focus on one relationship per character creates the perception of the character being either straight or gay. =Picture books= As of 2020, there are no known fiction picture books with bisexual characters. Most nonfiction works portraying historical people who had relationships with members of more than one gender tend to omit those elements of those characters' biographies. One picture book biography of Frida Kahlo's life, Nadia Fink's Frida Kahlo for Girls and Boys, published in English in 2017 by Books del Sur, mentions that Kahlo loved both men and women. = Middle grade = A growing number of books aimed at middle grade readers include bi characters, although these books have tended not to name these characters as explicitly bisexual. In 2016, Rick Riordan's The Hidden Oracle was released. The book, the first in Riordan's The Trials of Apollo series which takes place in his larger Camp Half-Blood Chronicles universe, is narrated by the god Apollo who alludes to having had numerous past relationships with men and women. Barbara Dee's Star-Crossed and Lisa Jenn Bigelow's Drum Roll, Please were published in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Both stories star a middle school-aged protagonist who has feelings for classmates of different genders. = Teen fiction = In the case of teen, or young adult (YA) fiction, the situation is different. There is more bi- visibility, but often they are not described positively, nor are they shown living happy bisexual lives. In David Leviathan's Boy Meets Boy, the main character is shown to resent the word bisexual because it makes it sound like he's divided. In another novel, Maureen Johnson's The Bermudez Triangle, one character is described as a \\"bisexual sex addict\\" and the main character Avery refuses to identify as bisexual because it makes her feel \\"gluttonous\\". In Nancy Garden's The Year They Burned the Books, bisexuality is essentially shown as a temporary state of confusion, with both characters unsure of their sexuality and not seeing it as a possibility. There are still positive representations of bisexuality in both contemporary and speculative YA fiction. Examples of positive representations include the following: * Our Own Private Universe by Robin Talley * Queens of Geek by Jen Wilde * The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue by Mackenzi Lee * Ramona Blue by Julie Murphy * Wild Beauty by Anna-Marie McLemore * Not Your Sidekick by C.B. Lee * Coda by Emma Trevayne * Not Otherwise Specified by Hannah Moskowitz * Otherbound by Corinne Duyvis * Empress of the World by Sara Ryan * The Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare * Of Fire and Stars by Audrey Coulthurst * The Raven Cycle by Maggie Stiefvater  See also  * Lesbian literature * Gay teen fiction * Transgender themes * List of media portrayals of bisexuality References ","title":"Bisexual literature"},{"id":"56525440","text":"Valentin P.

Some of the flows reflect specific cases and constraints such as incompressible, irrotational or both as in the case of Potential flow.  Two Dimensional uniform flow  Given a uniform velocity of a fluid at any position in space: :\\\\mathbf{V_0} = v_0 cos(\\\\theta_0) \\\\mathbf{e}_x +v_0 sin(\\\\theta_0) \\\\mathbf{e}_y This flow is incompressible because the velocity is constant, the first derivatives of the velocity components are zero, and the total divergence is zero: abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v} = 0 Given the circulation is always zero the flow is also irrotational, we can derive this from the Kelvin's circulation theorem and from the explicit computation of the Vorticity: :\\\\omega_z = \\\\partial v_x / \\\\partial y - \\\\partial v_y / \\\\partial x = 0 Being incompressible and two dimensional this flow is constructed from a stream function :v_x = - \\\\partial \\\\psi / \\\\partial y :v_y = \\\\partial \\\\psi / \\\\partial x from which :\\\\psi = - v_0 sin (\\\\theta_0) x + v_0 cos (\\\\theta_0) y And in cylindrical coordinates: :v_r = - 1/r \\\\partial \\\\psi / \\\\partial \\\\theta :v_\\\\theta = \\\\partial \\\\psi / \\\\partial r from which :\\\\psi = - v_0 r sin (\\\\theta - \\\\theta_0) As usual the stream function is defined up to a constant value which here we take as zero. We can also confirm that the flow is irrotational from : abla^2 \\\\psi = 0 Being irrotational, The potential function is instead: :v_x = - \\\\partial \\\\phi / \\\\partial x :v_y = - \\\\partial \\\\phi / \\\\partial y and therefore :\\\\phi = - v_0 cos (\\\\theta_0) x - v_0 sin (\\\\theta_0) y And in cylindrical coordinates :v_r = - \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\partial \\\\phi / \\\\partial r :v_\\\\theta = - \\\\partial \\\\phi / \\\\partial \\\\theta :\\\\phi = - v_0 r cos(\\\\theta - \\\\theta_0)  Two Dimensional line source  streamlines for an ideal vertical line source The case of a vertical line emitting at a fixed rate a constant quantity of fluid Q per unit length is a line source. The problem has a cylindrical simmetry and can be treated in two dimension on the orthogonal plane. Line sources and line sinks (below) are important elementary flows because they play the role of monopole(s) for incompressible fluids (which can also be considered examples of solenoidal fields i.e. divergence free fields). Generic flow patterns can be also de- composed in terms of multipole expansions, in the same manner as for electric and magnetic fields where the monopole is essentially the first non trivial (e.g. constant) term of the expansion. This flow pattern is also both irrotational and incompressible flow. This is characterized by a cylindrical symmetry: :\\\\mathbf{v} = v_r(r) \\\\mathbf{e}_r Where the total outcoming flux is constant : \\\\int_S \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot d \\\\mathbf{S} = \\\\int_{0}^{2 \\\\pi} ( v_r(r) \\\\, \\\\mathbf{e}_r ) \\\\cdot ( \\\\mathbf{e}_r \\\\, r \\\\, d \\\\theta ) = \\\\\\\\! 2 \\\\pi \\\\, r \\\\, v_r(r) = Q Therefore, :v_r = \\\\frac {Q}{2 \\\\pi r} This is derived from a stream function :\\\\psi(r,\\\\theta) = -\\\\frac{Q}{2 \\\\pi } \\\\theta or from a potential function :\\\\phi(r,\\\\theta) = -\\\\frac{Q}{2 \\\\pi } \\\\ln r  Two Dimensional line sink  The case of a vertical line absorbing at a fixed rate a constant quantity of fluid Q per unit length is a line sink. Everything is the same as the case of a line source a part from the negative sign. :v_r = - \\\\frac {Q}{2 \\\\pi r} This is derived from a stream function :\\\\psi(r,\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{Q}{2 \\\\pi } \\\\theta or from a potential function :\\\\phi(r,\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{Q}{2 \\\\pi } \\\\ln r Given that the two results are the same a part from a minus sign we can treat transparently both line sources and line sinks with the same stream and potential functions permitting Q to assume both positive and negative values and absorbing the minus sign into the definition of Q.  Two Dimensional doublet or dipole line source  If we consider a line source and a line sink at a distance d we can reuse the results above and the stream function will be :\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\psi_Q(\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{d}/2) - \\\\psi_Q(\\\\mathbf{r} + \\\\mathbf{d}/2) \\\\ \\\\simeq \\\\mathbf{d} \\\\cdot abla \\\\psi_Q(\\\\mathbf{r}) The last approximation is to the first order in d. Given :\\\\mathbf{d} = d [ cos \\\\theta_0 \\\\mathbf{e}_x + sin \\\\theta_0 \\\\mathbf{e}_y] = d [ cos (\\\\theta-\\\\theta_0) \\\\mathbf{e}_r + sin (\\\\theta-\\\\theta_0) \\\\mathbf{e}_\\\\theta] It remains : \\\\psi(r,\\\\theta) = - \\\\frac{Q d}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{sin(\\\\theta-\\\\theta_0)}{r} The velocity is then : v_r(r,\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{Q d}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{cos(\\\\theta-\\\\theta_0)}{r^2} : v_\\\\theta(r,\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{Q d}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{sin(\\\\theta-\\\\theta_0)}{r^2} And the potential instead : \\\\phi(r,\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{Q d}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{cos(\\\\theta-\\\\theta_0)}{r}  Two Dimensional vortex line  streamlines for an ideal vertical vortex line This is the case of a vortex filament rotating at constant speed, there is a cylindrical symmetry and the problem can be solved in the orthogonal plane. Dual to the case above of line sources, Vortex lines play the role of monopoles for irrotational flows. Also in this case the flow is also both irrotational and incompressible and therefore a case of Potential flow. This is characterized by a cylindrical symmetry: :\\\\mathbf{v} = v_\\\\theta(r) \\\\, \\\\mathbf{e}_\\\\theta Where the total circulation is constant for every closed line around the central vortex :\\\\oint \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot d \\\\mathbf{s} = \\\\int_{0}^{2 \\\\pi} (v_\\\\theta(r) \\\\, \\\\mathbf{e}_\\\\theta) \\\\cdot (\\\\mathbf{e}_\\\\theta \\\\, r \\\\, d\\\\theta) = \\\\\\\\! 2 \\\\pi \\\\, r\\\\, v_\\\\theta(r) = \\\\Gamma and is zero for any line not including the vortex. Therefore, :v_\\\\theta = \\\\frac {\\\\Gamma}{2 \\\\pi r} This is derived from a stream function :\\\\psi(r,\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma}{2 \\\\pi } \\\\ln r or from a potential function :\\\\phi(r,\\\\theta) = - \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma}{2 \\\\pi } \\\\theta Which is dual to the previous case of a line source  Generic Two Dimensional potential flow  Given an incompressible two dimensional flow which is also irrotational we have: : abla^2 \\\\psi = 0 Which is in cylindrical coordinates Laplace operator :\\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r} (r \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial r}) + \\\\frac{1}{r^2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\psi}{\\\\partial \\\\theta^2}= 0 We look for a solution with separated variables: :\\\\psi(r,\\\\theta) = R(r) \\\\Theta(\\\\theta) which gives :\\\\frac{r}{R(r)} \\\\frac{d}{dr} (r \\\\frac{d R(r)}{dr}) = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\Theta(\\\\theta)} \\\\frac{d^2 \\\\Theta(\\\\theta)}{d\\\\theta^2} Given the left part depends only on r and the right parts depends only on :\\\\theta, the two parts must be equal to a constant independent from r and \\\\theta. The constant shall be positive. Therefore, :r \\\\frac{d}{dr} (r \\\\frac{d}{dr} R(r)) = m^2 R(r) :\\\\frac{d^2 \\\\Theta(\\\\theta)}{d\\\\theta^2} = - m^2 \\\\Theta(\\\\theta) The solution to the second equation is a linear combination of e^{i m \\\\theta} and e^{-i m \\\\theta} In order to have a single valued velocity (and also a single valued stream function) m shall be a positive integer. therefore the most generic solution is given by :\\\\psi = \\\\alpha_0 + \\\\beta_0 \\\\ln r + \\\\sum_{m \\\\mathop > 0}{(\\\\alpha_m r^m + \\\\beta_m r^{-m})\\\\sin {[m(\\\\theta - \\\\theta_m)]}} The potential is instead given by :\\\\phi = \\\\alpha_0 - \\\\beta_0 \\\\theta + \\\\sum_{m \\\\mathop > 0}{(\\\\alpha_m r^m - \\\\beta_m r^{-m})\\\\cos {[m(\\\\theta - \\\\theta_m)]}} References ;Specific Further reading  External links Fluid dynamics ","title":"Elementary flow"},{"id":"56525558","text":"My Friend Victor (French: Mon ami Victor) is a 1931 French comedy film directed by Andr√© Berthomieu and starring Ren√© Lef√®vre, Pierre Brasseur and Simone Bourday.

L-space is a regular topological space that is hereditarily Lindel√∂f but not separable. A space is separable if it has a countable dense set and hereditarily separable if every subspace is separable. It had been believed for a long time that S-space problem and L-space problem are dual, i.e. if there is an S-space in some model of set theory then there is an L-space in the same model and vice versa ‚Äì which is not true. It was shown in the early 1980s that the existence of S-space is independent of the usual axioms of ZFC. This means that to prove the existence of an S-space or to prove the non-existence of S-space, we need to assume axioms beyond those of ZFC. The L-space problem (whether an L-space can exist without assuming additional set-theoretic assumptions beyond those of ZFC) was not resolved until recently. Todorcevic proved that under PFA there are no S-spaces. This means that every regular T_1 hereditarily separable space is Lindel√∂f. For some time, it was believed the L-space problem would have a similar solution (that its existence would be independent of ZFC). Todorcevic showed that there is a model of set theory with Martin's axiom where there is an L-space but there are no S-spaces. Further, Todorcevic found a compact S-space from a Cohen real. In 2005, Moore solved the L-space problem by constructing an L-space without assuming additional axioms and by combining Todorcevic's rho functions with number theory. Sources * K. P.

Its plot follows a soon-to-be stepmother who, alone with her fianc√©'s two children, becomes stranded at their rural lodge during Christmas. There, she and the children experience a number of unexplained events that seem to be connected to her past. The project was announced in October 2017, with Riley Keough joining the cast of the film and Franz and Fiala directing from a screenplay they wrote alongside Sergio Casci. Much of the cast joined that February 2018 and principal photography began in March 2018 and wrapped that same month. It had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2019, and was initially scheduled to be released in the United States in November 2019 by Neon. However, Neon pushed its released back to the following year. The film was given a limited release in the U.S. on February 7, 2020, which expanded on February 21. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances, direction, and screenplay, as well as the horror elements. Plot Laura Hall, separated from her husband, Richard, dies by suicide after he informs her he plans to marry Grace Marshall, a woman he met while researching a book about an extremist Christian cult. Raised in the cult, Grace was the sole survivor of their mass suicide, led by her father. Laura's death devastates her and Richard's children, teenage Aidan and young Mia. Six months later, Richard announces that they will spend Christmas with Grace at the family's remote Massachusetts lodge to get to know each other. Aidan and Mia uncover Grace's past, including video footage of the cult, showing the deceased followers draped in purple silk with duct tape across their mouths reading \\"sin.\\" At the lodge, the children act hostile toward Grace and refuse efforts to bond with her, even after Richard departs back to the city for a work obligation. Grace's unease is compounded by the abundance of Catholic iconography in the cabin, which causes her to have nightmares about her father. After being rebuked for watching her shower, Aidan prepares Grace a cup of cocoa. In the morning, Grace awakens to discover that her belongingsincluding her clothing, psychiatric medication, and pet dogare missing, as well as all the food and Christmas decorations. The generator has gone out, leaving all of their cell phones dead. Grace suspects the children have pranked her but finds their belongings missing as well. She notices the clocks have advanced to January 9. Aidan tells Grace he dreamed the gas heater malfunctioned and they all suffocated, and expresses fear that they may be in the afterlife. Over the next several days, Gracesuccumbing to anxiety, medication withdrawal, hunger, and coldbegins sleepwalking, and is tormented by disturbing visions and dreams, including the recurrent voice of her father sermonizing. She attempts to walk to the nearest town, discovering a cross-shaped cabin where she sees her father beckoning to her. She eventually travels in a circle, taking her back to the lodge. Buried in the snow, she discovers a photo of Aidan and Mia in a memorial frame, and inside, finds the children praying over a newspaper article detailing the deaths of all three from carbon monoxide poisoning on December 22. Aidan insists they are in purgatory, and hangs himself in the attic as proof that they are dead, only to inexplicably survive. Grace suffers a nervous breakdown, which intensifies when she finds her dog frozen to death outside. She enters a catatonic state on the porch. Worried she might die of exposure, the children finally admit that they have been gaslighting her the entire time, having drugged her, hidden their possessions in a crawlspace, faked the hanging, and played recordings of her father's sermons via a wireless speaker. With their own phones dead at last, the children unsuccessfully attempt to start the generator and bring Grace her medication, but find her convinced that they are in purgatory and must do penance to ascend to heaven. That night, the children witness Grace self-flagellating by burning herself on the hearth. They hide in the attic but Grace confronts them in the morning, insisting they must \\"sacrifice something for the Lord.\\" Richard returns to discover an inconsolable Grace brandishing his pistol. In an attempt to prove her belief that they are in purgatory, she fires the gun at him, killing him. Aidan and Mia attempt to flee in the car, but get stuck in the snow. Grace forces the children back into the lodge, where she seats them at the dinner table with their father's corpse and sings \\"Nearer, My God, to Thee.\\" She affixes duct tape reading \\"sin\\" to each of their mouths before contemplating the gun. Cast * Riley Keough as Grace Marshall ** Lola Reid as young Grace * Jaeden Martell as Aidan Hall * Lia McHugh as Mia Hall * Richard Armitage as Richard Hall * Alicia Silverstone as Laura Hall * Danny Keough as Aaron Marshall Production=Development= The original screenplay for The Lodge was written by Scottish screenwriter Sergio Casci, which had been sold to Hammer Films. Hammer offered the screenplay to be directed by filmmaking duo Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala. The two agreed, though they rewrote a significant portion of the script, including the ending, which Franz felt \\"didn't work.\\" =Casting= In October 2017, Riley Keough joined the cast of the film in the lead role of Grace. Prior to her being cast, Franz and Fiala were considering another unnamed actress for the part, but ultimately chose Keough. Franz stated: \\"The other actress had already started a journal about the character‚Äôs trauma. Then we met Riley, first on Skype and later personally. You know‚Äîit‚Äôs about meeting someone and connecting. That‚Äôs the first step: can you trust this person?\\" In February 2018, Jaeden Martell, Richard Armitage and Lia McHugh joined the cast of the film, with production beginning that same day. To establish chemistry between Martell and McHugh, portraying siblings, directors Franz and Fiala took them on several excursions, including rock climbing and ice skating, to help establish a bond between the two before filming began. Keough was kept separated from the children pre-filming meetings to maintain a distance from them for their onscreen dynamic. Keough's father Danny plays Aaron Marshall, the cult leader and father of Keough's character, Grace. =Filming= Rebecca (1940), about a woman who suspects her home is haunted by her husband's deceased first wife Filming of The Lodge took place outside of Montreal in the winter of 2018. The lodge featured in the film was located on a golf resort which was closed for the winter season. The film was shot in chronological order. Fiala elaborated on the decision to shoot chronologically: \\"[Riley] was worried that the journey her character takes was a very difficult one, because she has to hit every mark in a way that it still is plausible. And in order to help her walking down the path, we shot the whole film in sequence, not only to help her, but to help us, in order to really make this journey and watch every step we take. We felt it would help all the actors, actually, and could benefit their performances so much that we fought for that a lot.\\" The film was shot by cinematographer Thimios Bakatakis, a frequent collaborator of Yorgos Lanthimos. While shooting the interiors, Bakatakis, Franz, and Fiala deliberately chose to not frame shots at eye-level, instead opting for angles positioned from above or below the actors. Fiala commented that they intended to model the film after a haunted house movie, allowing the audience to initially suspect that the children's deceased mother, Laura, may be in fact haunting the home; in this regard, they were inspired specifically by Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940), in which a woman comes to believe her home is haunted by her husband's deceased first wife. Release The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2019. Shortly after, Neon acquired distribution rights to the film. The film was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on November 15, 2019, but it was delayed until February 7, 2020, when it was given a limited release in Los Angeles and New York City. The theatrical release expanded to 320 theaters in the United States on February 21, 2020. =Box office= During its opening week, The Lodge grossed $76,251 in six theaters in the United States. On February 14, the week following its initial release, the film expanded to 21 theaters, and had a weekend gross of $158,047. The film expanded to 322 theaters the following weekend. It concluded its U.S. theatrical run with a total gross of $1,666,564, and an international gross of $1,015,220, making for a worldwide gross of $2,681,784. =Critical response= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 74% based on 163 reviews, with a weighted average of 7/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Led by an impressive Riley Keough performance, The Lodge should prove a suitably unsettling destination for fans of darkly atmospheric horror.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote that \\"The Lodge may be best taken on the same terms as ‚Äô60s/early ‚Äô70s Italian giallos, with their somewhat random manipulations of plot and character logic in service of atmospheric shocks. Genre homage does not appear to be an intention here, but the film is certainly at its best in fostering a sense of stylish dread and orchestrating some harrowing individual sequences.\\" Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com echoed a similar sentiment, deeming the film \\"a truly unsettling movie, the kind of horror film that rattles you on an almost subconscious level, making you more uncomfortable than going for cheap scares. Don‚Äôt ask questions or dissect the believability of the plot. Just check in.\\" Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times noted the film's atmosphere as \\"so wintry in tone and setting that no movie-theater thermostat will banish its chill,\\" but ultimately felt that \\"despite its visual flair and unrelentingly taut atmosphere, The Lodge is more successful in sustaining unease... than in building a convincing narrative.\\" Benjamin Lee, writing for The Guardian, awarded the film four out of five stars, alternately praising it as \\"an accomplished beast: poking, prodding and teasing as it throws out potential twists before settling on the most devastating one of all. It‚Äôs not an entirely unpredictable revelation but it‚Äôs a smart, knowing and nasty way to go, taking the film to a place that‚Äôs both staggeringly grim and hopelessly sad.\\" Several critics singled out Keough's lead performance with praise, including Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound, who deemed it a \\"career- best... so much of Keough‚Äôs performance contends with the bitter silence of reproach, isolation, and abandonment. Keough thrives in these moments, oozing with all kinds of anxious body language. It‚Äôs in her glances. Those stares. The way she timidly saunters from room to room. She‚Äôs a vessel of tragedy that‚Äôs all the more tragic in her vicious attempts to keep on trying.\\" The Los Angeles Timess Justin Chang felt the film paled in comparison to Franz and Fiala's previous film, Goodnight Mommy, but similarly praised Keough's performance as \\"the movie‚Äôs strongest asset... [Keough] can seize and hold the screen with electrifying force... [and] is no less powerful in her quieter, more recessive moments.\\" See also *The Heaven's Gate mass suicide ReferencesExternal links 2019 films 2019 horror films American films American psychological horror films American Christmas horror films British Christmas films British films British psychological horror films 2010s Christmas films 2010s Christmas horror films Films about Catholicism Films about cults Films about suicide Films set in Massachusetts Films shot in Montreal Mental illness in films Religious horror films FilmNation Entertainment films Hammer Film Productions films Neon (distributor) films 2010s psychological horror films ","title":"The Lodge (film)"},{"id":"56525788","text":"The Protect and Preserve International Cultural Property Act is a United States Act of Congress that became law in 2016.

Publilius Publiliae et C. Vibi Rufi l. Strato.\\" Syme notes that Publilia was wealthy, and that marrying for wealth was common in their time, providing examples contemporary to Rufus and Publilia. Although the praenomen of her father is known, Syme comments, \\"It is perhaps unfortunate, but no great loss, that her wealthy father Marcus should elude discovery.\\"Syme, \\"Vibius Rufus\\", pp. 367f Between the unknown date of this marriage, and his consulate, Rufus established himself as an orator: Seneca the Younger mentions him almost thirty times in his writings.Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), p. 225 According to Syme, \\"Specimens quoted show directness, and a lack of metaphor, paradox, or subtlety.\\" By the time Rufus achieved the consulate, he was an elderly man. Another inscription attests that a few years after he stepped down from that office, Rufus was appointed president of the curatores riparum et alvei Tiberis, one of the officials responsible for public works inside the city, regulating the Tiber and the maintenance of Rome's sanitation system; this board was created in response to a severe flood the year prior to Rufus' consulship.

The company became a Co-operative, and grew by admitting hotel owners as shareholders, and absorbed smaller breweries. After several amalgamations it moved its operations to Southwark (now part of Thebarton) and by 1920 it was South Australia's largest brewing company. It was bought out by the South Australian Brewing Company in 1939 and its facilities became the company's Southwark brewery, which still operates. History The first brewery in Walkerville was founded by William Colyer and William Williams, South Australia's first licensed publican. The partnership was dissolved late the same year, Colyer returned to England., Williams embarked on a program of expansion. He commissioned architect Thomas PricePrice was active in Adelaide 1845‚Äì50; laid out the suburb Knightsbridge (became part of Leabrook), designed New Queen's Theatre for George Coppin, a housing estate for George Bean, grandstand at the Old Adelaide Racecourse and did much dealing in real estate. to erect new buildings on Fuller Street in 1846, identified as Lots 66 and 67, although Lots 64 and 65 on the other side of Walkerville Terrace (also known as Richmond Road) closer to the Torrens would seem more likely. A series of tunnels running down to the Torrens from Fuller Street and Warwick Street served as cellars (filled in c. 1970 preparatory to erecting the Highways Department building). The \\"tunnel\\" story has elsewhere been debunked, and identified as nothing but drains. Williams was found insolvent 1851, but had his certificate annulled in 1853. At some stage there was another brewery on Lot 41, Walkerville, on land purchased by N. P. Levi in October 1842, but whether part of this history is as yet not determined. *William Williams (c. 1803 ‚Äì 26 April 1858), arrived 1836 aboard Not to be confused with William Williams (c. 1817 ‚Äì 17 August 1859), also on the \\"First Fleet of South Australia\\" aboard Cygnet, married Maria Wickham (1820 ‚Äì 17 February 1872), https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/92270959 with parents aboard Africaine, on 12 August 1839 and was \\"the first (colonist) to drink Torrens water\\". He married Jane Catchlove (c. 1811 ‚Äì 20 April 1885) on 2 July 1837. Jane arrived in South Australia in November 1836 aboard with her father Edward William Catchlove and three brothers and sisters. Henry Catchlove of Hindmarsh Brewery was an uncle. William and Jane had seven children, among them William Huey Williams MD was educated at AEI and SPC, appointed Resident House Physician, Royal infirmary Liverpool; and Mary Laura Williams (1845 ‚Äì 13 November 1880) married Thomas Moseley, son of Henry Moseley of Glenelg, on 25 October 1877. :Williams gained notoriety in 1851 for his obstruction to the formation of the Walkerville Anglican Church committee. :He died destitute and a subscription organised to benefit his widow and seven children was well patronised. Edmund Levi, brother of Philip, the property's owner, took over management of Walkerville Brewery in 1853, leasing it to one James Thomson. In January 1860 fire destroyed the malthouse, which had been leased to Richard Goss (died 1869), who sold malt to Simms as well as to Thomson. In 1854 Thomson relinquished his share of the business and in October left the partnership to White & Phillips who shortly went bankrupt. Samuel Vincent Price Phillips, Thomson was found insolvent in 1864 and jailed for two months. He was not clearly related to James Turnbull Thomson, brewer and founder of Balhannnah, who had more than his share of financial failures. *William Hardyman Colyer (17 January 1816 ‚Äì 15 August 1891 in Rondebosch) arrived in South Australia aboard Winchester September 1838, and acted as brewer for a company in Launceston before in 1844 founding a brewery in Walkerville, South AustraliaIt is likely he acted as consultant, setting up a brewery, training a successor and moving on. He later settled in South Africa. *Edmund Levi (1827 ‚Äì 30 July 1895) arrived in Adelaide in 1842, joined brother Philip's P. Levi & Co. in 1854. He married Gertrude Goldsmid in 1862. *Charles White (‚Äì) was chairman of the first Council of the District of Walkerville, with councillors J. H. Swann, John Campbell, J. D. Woods, and Thomas Beadle.List of Walkerville Council chairmen *Samuel Vincent Price Phillips (‚Äì c. 1896) left for the goldfields c. 1858, died in England. *James Thomson was perhaps James Thomson \\"the elder\\" who arrived aboard Moffat December 1839 with wife Mary (c. 1791 ‚Äì 5 April 1875), with children Emma and Thomas, founded Sussex Arms Hotel 1843, died before 1875. In 1847 his daughter Betsy Thomson (c. 1816 ‚Äì 12 February 1893) married James Maskall Nottage (1821 ‚Äì 17 December 1879), to whom Thomson transferred the \\"Sussex Arms\\"' licence in 1853, and for whom Nottage Terrace was named. Daughter Louisa Thomson married Benjamin Boyce (‚Äì 1 December 1847), subject of ADB article, on 26 September 1843 Around 1862 Ball & Huntley took over Thomson's defunct brewery, named it the \\"Black Horse Brewery\\". and began brewing there again, purchasing the property in 1870. Their malthouse was destroyed by fire on 5 June 1871. Ball died in 1882 and Huntley continued operating the brewery until 1890 when he retired. *George Ball (c. 1831 ‚Äì 1 November 1882) and his wife Anna Jane Ball (c. 1834 ‚Äì 4 June 1924) arrived in Adelaide aboard emigrant ship China in November 1852. *George Huntley (5 February 1832 ‚Äì 9 August 1917) arrived in Adelaide around 1851, worked as a builder, then for White & Phillips, brewers. In September 1855 he married Mary Ann Clarke, widow of Joseph Clarke of Walkerville. Joseph and Mary Ann Clarke arrived aboard Harpley, perhaps refugees from France, in September 1848. Joseph's death was not reported in newspapers or in BMD lists, perhaps interstate. In 1889 the brewery was taken over and run as a co-operative by a consortium of four \\"free\\" hotel owners: Robert Hyman, John Selby Cocker, Samuel Harris, and Vincent Henry Simpson. *Robert Hyman (1851 ‚Äì December 1903), a Finnish-born hotelkeeper, was a founder of Walkerville Brewery Co- operative in 1889 and remained one of the largest shareholders m that business and on board of directors from 1886 to 1903. He married Sarah North in 1876; a granddaughter Gwendoline Kathleen Hyman (1903‚Äì1992) on 16 February 1926) married Louis Alfred von Doussa in 1926 *John Selby Cocker (c. 1844 ‚Äì 14 April 1901) arrived with his father aboard Hooghly in October 1846, worked on the Overland Telegraph Line, then as a baker before taking over his father's Kentish Arms Hotel on Stanley Street, North Adelaide. He was one of the four original members of the Co-operative. He married Joan Agnes Dineen in 1878. *Samuel Harris (c. 1844 ‚Äì 23 February 1904) arrived in South Australia with his parents aboard John Bunyan in 1854. After many years with the coachmaking firm of Barlow & Sons he became landlord, then publican of the Gasworks Hotel in Brompton. He was chairman of directors of the Walkerville Co-operative for ten years. *Vincent Henry Simpson (1860 ‚Äì 12 July 1926) was born in Norwood a son of Frederick John Simpson (died 1883), and educated at Unwin's school in North Adelaide. He was publican of the Buckingham Arms, Gilberton at an early age, and married Emily Chittleborough ( ‚Äì1952) in 1885. He was chairman of directors of the Co-operative. The Walkerville Brewing Company was founded with 19 other shareholders, all publicans or hotel owners, whose share of the profits depended on the amount of trade they did with the company. The company merged with Clark and Ware's company and its operations moved to Southwark, but the Walkerville Brewery had one last spasm when it was resurrected by Charles Williams in 1901 and operated for five more years before closing for the last time; see below for more information. Amalgamations ;Torrenside Brewery Frequently spelled \\"Torrensside\\", the brewery was founded by the Port Road Southwark, now Thebarton, on the banks of the Torrens in 1886 by A. W. & T. L. Ware. Their first customer was the Exchange Hotel, operated by their brothers George and Boxer. The Ware brothers were sons of Charles James Ware (c. 1824 ‚Äì 19 December 1891) who arrived in SA aboard Augustus in November 1846 and married Fanny Crawford (1829 ‚Äì 7 April 1898) on 22 August 1859. Fanny arrived with her parents aboard D'Auvergne in March 1839. Fanny was the daughter of William Crawford, Builder. Charles ran the Burra Hotel, then in 1868 took over the Exchange Hotel, owned by Sir Henry Ayers. *Arthur Wellington Ware CMG (1861 ‚Äì 29 January 1927) Mayor of Adelaide 1898‚Äì1901. He married Rosa Henrietta Haussen (2 November 1860 ‚Äì 29 November 1915) of the Hindmarsh Brewery Haussen family, on 11 March 1884. *Thomas Lincoln \\"Tom\\" Ware (1864 ‚Äì 22 December 1896) died while swimming near the Grange jetty. *George James Ware (15 February 1867 ‚Äì 17 June 1948) *(Charles) Boxer Ware (26 December 1870 ‚Äì 23 July 1932) was educated at Stanley Grammar School, Watervale, served as mayor of Thebarton for four years and for some time chairman of directors, Walkerville Co-operative Brewing. ;East Adelaide Brewery Edward Clark, son of W. H. Clark, was brewer for the Murray Brewery in Goolwa in the 1880s, formed E. Clark & Co. in Adelaide with one A. Wheelwright, was found insolvent in 1889 through lack of capital, then served as brewer for the Walkerville Co-operative Brewing Company. He left the Co- operative in 1895 to manage the East Adelaide Brewery, a two-storey establishment which the newly revived E. Clark & Co. built on the south side of the River Torrens, on Walkerville Road (now Stephen Terrace). The probable location is about 1km south of the Walkerville Brewery. E. Clark & Co. was founded with twelve shareholders inc. William Warren, James Wells, and Eliza Dreyer as Clark & Co., became Clark, Ware & Co. before absorbing the old Walkerville Brewing Company. * William Walter Warren (c. 1860 ‚Äì 24 February 1938) may have had a hotel, but was better known as a racehorse breeder. *James Samuel Wells (1872‚Äì1959), son of Michael Wells (‚Äì 14 August 1887) and Elizabeth Wells n√©e Davis (‚Äì), owners of Parkside Hotel. *Eliza Jane Dreyer (c. 1861 ‚Äì 25 September 1926) had Prince Albert Hotel in Wright street for 30 years. The product proved so popular the factory's capacity had to be doubled a year later. In 1897 a bottling plant was installed and production capacity doubled again. By 1898 the East Adelaide Brewery was contracted to supply fifty \\"free houses\\", and once again a doubling of capacity was deemed necessary to keep up with demand. It was decided instead to amalgamate with the Wares' Torrenside Brewery, which took place in April 1898, their owners combining as Clark, Ware & Co.. The East Adelaide premises were closed and the Torrenside brewery at Southwark expanded. ;Walkerville Co-operative In 1899 the activities of the Walkerville Brewing Company and Clark, Ware & Co. combined as Walkerville Co-operative Brewing Company at Southwark. Additional buildings were erected at the site. The old Walkerville Brewery was taken over by its erstwhile head brewer Charles Williams in 1901 and operated successfully as \\"Williams' Walkerville Brewery\\", with outlets at the Tea Tree Gully Hotel and perhaps a few others not tied to either of the two combines, no doubt to the chagrin of the Co-operative, which bought out the company in 1906. *Samuel Joshua Jacobs (1853 ‚Äì 1937) was chairman of directors from the formation of the Company, succeeded by C. Boxer Ware. He was also president of Chamber of Commerce, and of United Chambers of Manufacture, chairman of Tattersalls Racing Club. *Charles Williams (c. 1850 ‚Äì c. 12 April 1936) was born in Adelaide, educated at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution, worked at the brewery his father John Williams (c. 1806 ‚Äì 29 June 1876) owned at Angas Park, then in Ballarat. He became head brewer at the Lion Brewing and Malting Company and for the Walkerville Brewing Company. When that company moved to Southwark he reopened the old facility and continued brewing for another five years. After ten years' inactivity he became brewer for the Waverley Brewery, Mitcham and retired at the age of 83. Relationship, if any, to William Williams, Adelaide's first publican and founder of Walkerville Brewery has not been determined. A popular drink produced by the Walkerville Co-op was K√∂nig Lager, whose name was changed to Adelaide Lager in 1914 amid the anti-German sentiment that swept Australia and resulted in wholesale changing of German-sounding place names. The Walkerville Co-Operative Brewing Co. continued its growth and by the end of World War I was the largest brewery in South Australia. In September 1925 Walkerville Co-operative Brewing Company, Limited, was first listed on the Adelaide Stock Exchange. Directors were Charles Boxer Ware, Frederick James Blades, Vincent Henry Simpson, and William Walter Warren. The company absorbed Haussen's Brewery in 1926; Haussen & Co. retained ownership of its string of hotels. In November 1925 the Walkerville Co-operative Brewing Company Ltd signed an agreement with the Nathan Institute of Z«îrich for the installation of a \\"Nathan patent\\" plant at the company's brewery at Southwark, and has been claimed as the first Australian adopter of the system. It was a major project for the brewery, requiring the erection of additional buildings to accommodate the new equipment. Beer production commenced in the Nathan plant late in 1927, and a formal opening ceremony was held in January 1928. However Nathan's process was in operation at Peter Grant Hay's Richmond N.S. Brewery in 1927, so although they signed the contract earlier, Southwark brewery was the second in Australia to implement the system. *Leopold Nathan, born 30 July 1864 in W√ºrttemberg, Germany, invented a closed brewing system in cylindro-conical vessels, which he began marketing in the 1920s. His system removed many of the uncertainties in the brewing process, ensuring a reliable, consistent, high quality product. The company made substantial losses in the year 1928‚Äì29. ;South Australian Brewing Company The Walkerville Co-operative Brewing Company Ltd. was bought out by the South Australian Brewing Company in 1939 and its facilities became the company's main brewery, which still operates at the same location, and in 1949 was renamed from Walkerville brewery to Southwark Brewery. Walkerville Nathan beer was renamed Southwark beer in November 1951.

Principally authored by the Chief Scientific Adviser to the BIS (Professor John Perkins), it made key recommendations for improving the training of British engineers and encouraging more entrants into the profession. Key aspects it highlighted included the gender gap, with ten times more men employed in the profession than women, and the current reliance on foreign engineers.  The report  The report was commissioned by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) under the Cameron‚ÄìClegg coalition government and took two years to prepare. The principal author of the report was Professor John Perkins, the chief scientific adviser to BIS, and it was published in November 2013. Perkins' contract expired the next year and he left the BIS. A 1980 paper, the Finniston Report made a similar review of the state of the engineering profession in the United Kingdom.  Findings  Perkins stated that an engineering skills shortage was hampering the country's recovery from the Great Recession. There was a \\"substantial demand for engineers\\" and an undersupply which meant that 73% of manufacturing companies had reported a difficulty in filling engineering roles since 2010. More than half of the occupations listed in the British government's tier 2 shortage occupations list are in engineering with a further 20% for allied scientific or technical roles. The report showed that there was a failure to attract girls into the profession. It stated that only 35% of 11‚Äì14 year-old girls would consider a career in engineering and only 24% of their parents would consider it a suitable career for their daughters. This fed through into the older age groups ‚Äì at further education level only around 15% of applicants for undergraduate engineering courses are women and only one in ten of British engineering professionals are female, the lowest proportion in any country of the European Union. Perkins stated that there was a lack of female role models from within the profession. In press interviews accompanying the release of the report business secretary Vince Cable stated that \\"half of all state schools don't have a single girl doing physics\\". Perkins showed that the profession was relying on immigrants to make up the skills deficit. The report stated that in some sectors such as oil and gas or aerospace immigrants accounted for 20% of professional engineering roles and that 32% of students studying engineering and technology in the UK were from overseas. The Perkins report made 22 key recommendations for the government to address the skills shortage. This included working to promote the industry to girls, increasing the uptake of A-level physics, recruiting more physics teachers and introducing new vocational qualifications for 16-19 year olds. He also urged the professional engineering institutions to work to promote the sector to young people.  Impact  Upon his retirement Perkins expressed confidence that the government had implemented measures to address the skills shortage. This included providing additional university funding for STEM courses, to fund engineering research and to construct teaching facilities. He also highlighted work done by practising engineers in schools and colleges to promote the subject. As part of the response to the Perkins Review business secretary Vince Cable announced ¬£49 million of funding for improvements to engineering education. This included funding for the new Manufacturing Technology Centre in Coventry, schemes to encourage children to consider engineering as a career and for initiatives to encourage former engineers to return to the industry. The funding was monitored as part of the government's Employer Ownership Fund. A further ¬£2.8 million of funding, as part of the Improving Engineering Careers scheme, was announced in March 2015 to help six companies implement the objectives of the Perkins Review. The companies, which included the Nissan plant in Sunderland, would match the government funding and implement schemes to train more British engineers and offer more job positions. The government will introduce the first T Levels, a new technical qualification for 17-18 year olds from 2020. The review was welcomed by many of the engineering institutions including the Institution of Engineering and Technology, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and the Nuclear Institute ‚Äì many of whom highlighted their existing schemes to encourage women and young people into the industry. One key outcome from the report was support for the Tomorrow's Engineers programme, a national initiative to give every 11- to 14-year-old hand-on experience with a local engineering firm. A year on from the report the programme had reached 50,000 school pupils in more than 1,200 schools. Girls who participated in the programme were 50% more likely to see engineering as an attractive career choice. Shortly after its publication the report was debated by the British House of Commons in a Westminster Hall debate on 10 December 2013. Conservative MP Peter Luff advocated targeting campaigns at age groups even younger than the 11-year-olds proposed in Perkins' report, citing research from the National Foundation for Educational Research that intervention at primary school age was most effective ‚Äì an opinion echoed by Meg Munn. Andrew Miller advocated a more joined up system of apprenticeships as a means of meeting the Perkins objectives. David Mowat called for greater visibility of engineers in the media and noted that, unlike in Britain, in Europe engineers were held in higher regard ‚Äì on a par with doctors. He also noted that salaries were an issue with many engineering graduates entering other high-paid professions such as accountancy instead. Perkins carried out his own review on actions taken in the year following the publication of the report. He noted the improvement in the standing of the profession brought about by the government funding of the Tomorrow's Engineers programme and the successful introduction of a \\"Tomorrow's Engineers Week\\". He also welcomed the actions taken by 200 engineering companies to open up new entry-level engineering positions and to implement their own schemes to attract young people and women into the profession. There was also an improvement recognised in the education sector with steps taken to fund scholarships to attract high-quality STEM candidates into the teaching profession but noted that there had been no progress in improving the uptake of A-level physics amongst female students. At further education level it was noted that applications for engineering courses had increased by 6.1% over the previous year and recognised an increase of ¬£385 million in government funding of science and engineering courses.

State laws permitting this are on the books in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, and Washington.  California  In the state of California, obtaining a driver's license did not require proof of legal presence since the early 1990s. However, California blocked off this access in 1991, by asking all driver license applicants to provide proof of citizenship. Two years later, California explicitly committed to require proof of license to state issued driver's licenses by passing Senate Bill 976. Under SB 976 anyone requesting a driver's license from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) needed to provide proof of lawful presence in the United States. The more stringent requirements did not sit well with some of California's state legislators. Gil Cedillo, for example, chipped away at SB 976, an attempt to remove the legal presence requirement in California for state issued driver's licenses. In 2003, one of Cedillo's proposals (Senate Bill 60) gained significant support in California's State legislature, was signed by former Governor Gray Davis, but did not become a law According to Tang (2018), Cedillo decided to scrap the bill because Governor Davis, who had signed the bill, was dealing with a gubernatorial recall election. Between 2006 and 2012, Cedillo continued the fight to remove the legal presence requirement in California to obtain driver's licenses. However, former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed efforts to remove the legal requirement for licenses in California supported by state legislators such as Cedillo during his term as governor. According to Andrea Silva, assembly member Luis Alejo joined the fight to license illegal aliens in California early on in 2013. Various progressive organizations such as the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA), the California Immigrant Policy Center (CIPC), the National Immigrant Law Center (NILC) and community activists rallied behind Alejo. However, not everyone was on board with the AB 60 law. For example, some groups such as Unlicensed to Kill and Californians for Population Stabilization resisted the measure. In the past, groups such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform have also supported requiring proof of legal presence to obtain CA driver's licenses. In 2013, California removed the proof of legal presence requirement to obtain a state issued driver licenses. California Governor Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill 60 (AB 60) into law. Currently still known under its bill number, AB 60 removes the legal proof requirement in California to apply for a state issued driver's licenses. These driver's licenses are not REAL ID Act compliant. This means holders of these driver's licenses could not use this identification to board an airplane, vote, or enter federal facilities. Moreover, all applicants need to have their vehicles insured. However, some California residents who do not support the AB 60 law questions whether these safeties are enough. The AB 60 law did not take effect until the beginning of 2015. In the first twelve months, a little over 600,000 people in California met all the eligibility requirements to obtain a driver's license. This number continued to increase in the following months. By the end of 2017, a little over 900,000 people without proof of legal presence in California obtained a driver's license under the AB 60 law. With an increase in AB 60 driver's licenses, at least one study suggests there has been a decrease in hit-and-run incidents.  Oregon  Oregon now issues such licenses, following the passage of the Equal Access To Roads Act (HB 2015) in the Oregon legislature; governor Kate Brown signed the bill into law on August 9, 2019, and it became effective immediately. Oregon also previously issued such licenses in 2008 and from 2013 until the 2014 Oregon Ballot Measure 88.  New York =Prior to 2002= Prior to 2002, obtaining a driver's license in New York did not require proof of legal presence. =Actions of the Pataki administration in 2002 and 2004= On September 2002, Governor George Pataki issued an executive order directing the Department of Motor Vehicles to require a social security number before issuing a driver's license. The Pataki administration presented the measure as a \\"crackdown on license fraud and as the kind of national security measure demanded by the Sept. 11 attacks\\". In 2004, under a policy instituted by the Pataki administration, the Department of Motor Vehicles began putting \\"temporary visitor\\" marks on licenses issued to individuals with temporary visas, along with the date that those visas expired. = First attempts to restore access to drivers licenses for illegal immigrants = On September 21, 2007, Governor Eliot Spitzer issued an executive order directing that state offices allow illegal immigrants to be issued driver's licenses. The measure was supposed to be effective on December 2007. Eventually, the executive order was withdrawn. The effort by Eliot Spitzer was introduced as a legislative bill, which was defeated in the New York State Senate. Finally, the effort to restore access to driver's licenses was passed as an administrative measure through the Department of Motor Vehicles only to be withdrawn in the face of political opposition and criticism. In 2017, New York began issuing \\"REAL ID\\"-compliant driver's licenses. The state now employs a multi-tier system, as permitted by federal law, and offers three licenses: (1) the \\"enhanced\\" license, (2) The \\"REAL ID\\" license, and (3) the \\"standard\\" license, which is used for identification purposes and for driving, but is not REAL ID- compliant. Displayed on its face are the words, \\"NOT FOR FEDERAL PURPOSES\\". From 2001 to 2019, illegal immigrants were not eligible for driver's licenses in New York. Although there is nothing in New York law that requires legal status in order to obtain a standard driver's license, a 2001 executive order issued by then-Governor George Pataki created a rule that effectively prevents illegal immigrants and other individuals without a Social Security number from obtaining licenses. = Green Light New York Coalition = In 2016, renewed effort formed a new coalition: Green Light NY. The coalition was formed primarily by Justice for Migrant Families, Worker Justice Center of New York, Workers‚Äô Center of Central New York Columbia County Sanctuary Movement, Nobody Leaves Mid Hudson, Neighbors Link, MinKwon Center for Community Action, New York Immigration Coalition, and Make the Road New York with the state-wide coordination of the New York Immigration Coalition and Nobody Leaves Mid Hudson. In 2019, the coalition broadened and gained the critical support of many persons and organizations including: New York City Mayor, Bill de Blasio, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark, Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, Jr. On February 13, 2019, the coalition secured a resolution form the New York City Council calling for state legislation addressing this matter. New York State Attorney General Letitita James also came out in support of the proposed legislation. Other social leaders came on board, including Rev. Al Sharpton who stated: \\"When routine traffic stops regularly lead to arrests and deportations of Black and Brown New Yorkers, something has to give, ... that's why the Green Light NY bill isn't just a public safety issue ‚Äî it's a civil rights concern.\\" = Political Issue in the 2018 New York State Elections = In 2018 the issue began gaining more attention and became a relevant issue of the 2018 New York gubernatorial election, particularly the Democratic Primary. Then Candidate for Governor Cynthia Nixon promised an executive order to immediately restore access to drivers licenses the day after taking office. Candidate Nixon made her announcement together with Council member Carlos Menchaca. Governor Andrew Cuomo, the incumbent on the race, had consistently opposed the restoration of access through an executive order claiming that history proves that trying to push through such a plan via executive order is doomed to fail. Attorney Luis Gomez Alfaro and the Latinos for Cuomo Committee came out strongly in support of full legislation fearing that an executive order would be challenged by County Executives or County Clerks. Before the contested primary election, Kathy Hochul reversed her opposition to the restoration of Driver's Licenses and announced that she now stood with her running mate, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in supporting licenses for the undocumented. Cuomo soundly defeated Nixon in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, and went on to similarly defeat Marc Molinaro in the General Election. = Assembly vote = In 2019, Assemblyman Marcos Crespo introduced a bill A03675 named the \\"Driver's License Access and Privacy Act.\\" On June 5th 2019, Speaker Carl Heastie announced that the Assembly would bring the bill to a vote and pass the bill, calling it \\"a critical step towards making our roads safer, boosting our state's economy and protecting hardworking New Yorkers and their families.\\" On June 12, 2019, Bill A03675 passed the Assembly with 86 votes in favor and 47 votes against the bill.https://www.huffpost.com/entry/drivers-liscense-undocumented- immigrants_n_5d02934ce4b0dc17ef06422f = Senate vote = In 2019, a version of the \\"Driver's License Access and Privacy Act\\", bill S1747. was introduced into the Senate by Luis Sepulveda. Unlike Speaker Heastie, Majority Leader Andrea Stweart-Cousins had not publicly omitted to schedule the bill for a vote before the end of the 2019 Legislative Session. On June 11, 2019 Deputy Majority Leader, Senator Mike Gianaris came in support of scheduling a vote for the bill stating ‚ÄúI wholeheartedly support this proposal and encourage all my colleagues to get behind this proposal before the legislative session ends.‚Äù After the vote had cleared the Transportation Committee, Governor Cuomo expressed last-minute fears that the federal government could use state- collected information for immigration enforcement and almost derailed the vote after asking Solicitor General Barbara Underwood to weigh in on the matter. On June 17, 2019, the Attorney General of New York, Letitia James answered the governor stating: \\"I support the Green Light bill, and the Office of Attorney General has concluded that it is constitutional.\\" She added that \\"the legislation is well crafted and contains ample protections for those who apply for driver‚Äôs licenses.\\" She concluded that \\"If this bill is enacted and challenged in court, we will vigorously defend it.‚Äù Additionally, the Office of the Attorney General released a memo regarding the Green Light Bill, which put to rest any legal questions and allowed the bill to be put forward for a vote before the end of the 2019 Legislative Session. The Senate passed the bill on June 17, 2019 with 33 votes in favor and 29 votes against. The legislation was signed into law by Governor Cuomo the same night that it passed the Senate.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/nyregion/undocumented- immigrants-drivers-licenses-ny.html = Reaction = Some county clerks said they would not comply with the law, stating that federal labor law prohibits employment of illegal immigrants. Monroe County Executive Cheryl Dinolfo said she was making plans to sue and called her county's legislature to craft a bill allowing a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the plan. Erie County Clerk Michael Kearns has stated that he will not enforce the law and that he's going to federal court. Attorney General of New York Letitia James said she would defend the law. She stated: ‚ÄúIt is not an immigration bill. It‚Äôs not going to dumb down our citizenship. It basically gives a privilege to individuals to drive to work and to school.‚Äù Among the Democratic senators, seven opposed the Driver's License Access and Privacy Act: James Skoufis, Kevin Thomas, Monica R. Martinez, Todd Kaminsky, John E. Brooks, Anna M. Kaplan, and Jim Gaughran. This list includes all 6 senators from Long Island, including the three with the most recent immigrant heritage: Kevin Thomas, Anna M. Kaplan, and Monica R. Martinez. Of all Senators voting against the bill, Senator Monica R. Martinez faced the most criticisms as she had previously been a supporter of the effort to restore access to drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants, but changed her position after becoming a New York State Senator.

Bishop Paul (de Ballester-Convallier) of Nazianzus (Barcelona, Spain, July 3, 1927 - City of Mexico, Mexico 1984) was a convert from Roman Catholicism to Eastern Orthodoxy who became the titular bishop of Nazianzus in Mexico, and was martyred in 1984. In addition to his religious and pastoral activities, Bishop Paul was a historian, philosopher and humanist. Besides his native Catalan and Spanish, he also knew Greek, French, Italian, English, Latin and Portuguese.. His father Francisco Ballester Gales was a prominent speaker of the Ido international language (esperanto-reformed). He co-authored a method to learn this international language. Biography Pablo de Ballester-Convallier was born in 1927 in Barcelona, Spain, in a prominent Aragonese family. The dismemberment of his family during the Spanish Civil War impacted him deeply, leading him to follow religious life, studying theology among the Sarri√† Capuchins before becoming a novice in a monastery of the Capuchin Order in Arenys de Mar. Working in its library, he came across anathemas from the Inquisition against all who supported the autonomous apostolic validity of the Apostle Paul, which he later found to be repeated by popes John XXII, Clement VI, Pius X and Benedict XV. Being thereby discouraged by his confessor to study the Bible and the Church Fathers, he renounced papal supremacy, moving to Madrid, where he was able to join the Anglican Church and established communication with the World Council of Churches, eventually meeting Orthodox Christians. Orthodox Christianity became increasingly more interesting to Pablo, leading him to buy Greek and Russian books from Western shops, as well as some provided by Archimandrite Benedict Katsenavakis, from Napoli. In 1953, aware there was still no Orthodox presence in Spain, he contacted the Church of Greece and the Ecumenical Patriarchate, being received in Athens by Archbishop Spyridon of Athens and Metropolitan Dionysius of Servia and Kozani, ordained into the deaconate by the latter in the same year, and into priesthood by Bishop Chrysostom of Marathon. He was a minister in the Church of Constantinople for five years, and then in the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America for eleven more, until in 1970 he was named Titular Bishop of Nazianzus by the Holy Synod presided by Patriarch Athenagoras, being consecrated in the same year in a ceremony presided by Archbishop Iakovos of America, receiving his seat in Mexico. Bishop Paul's work in Mexico as a churchman, university professor and author was conspicuous, with his deeds including the foundation of the Hellenic Cultural Institute in the City of Mexico in 1973, in the purpose of publicize culture in Mexico through conferences, courses, workshops, licentiates and masters in arts, Mexican history, culture and humanities, as well as a diversity of cultural activities. His activities, however, came to end on January 31, 1984, after celebrating Divine Liturgy, when he was shot dead by Rafael Roman Mondrago, a mentally disturbed Mexican, who then shot himself in an apparent suicide attempt. Authorities did not discard the possibility that the murderer would be driven by some sort of religious fanaticism. His funeral was attended by Archbishop Iakovos. In a visit to Mexico in 2006, Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople asked Metropolitan Athenagoras of Mexico and Central America to transfer the relics of the late Bishop Paul to the Metropolis and be laid to rest in the Cathedral Church of Saint Sophia, in Naucalpan, where a monument is dedicated to him.

The roadway runs from just north of the Leelanau County line to an intersection at Front Street just east of downtown. It consists of US Highway 31 (US 31), M-22, M-37, and M-72. Also, the entirety of the highway is concurrent with the Lake Michigan Circle Tour. The highway is just north of the Boardman River and south of West Bay, meaning that many recreational sites are on either side of the parkway. It is known to be one of the main sites of the National Cherry Festival, which takes place every July.  Route description  Downtown Traverse City from the Grandview Parkway intersection at Park Street The parkway is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation. This highway is one of the busiest non-freeway highways in Northern Michigan, despite it being long. The highway is partially on the National Highway System; west of Division Street, the highway is not part of the system. However, the entire roadway is concurrent with the Lake Michigan Circle Tour, a tourist route that encircles Lake Michigan. New Murchie Bridge over the Boardman River in January 2018 The highway starts at a five-way dog- leg intersection at Front Street, US 31/M-37/M-72, Franklin Street, and Railroad Street. The highway then splits and travels westward, passing by the former site of Wequetong, the original settlement of Traverse City. This is the beginning of the parkway running parallel to the TART Trail. The highway then crosses over the Boardman River at the New Murchie Bridge, implemented in 2017. After this bridge, there is a major interchange at Park Street, which leads directly into downtown Traverse City. The north side of the roadway then runs parallel to Clinch Park, a major park/beach in Traverse City. Another major interchange approaches, Union Street/Marina Drive, another major artery to Traverse City's Central Business District. This is also the entrance to the Duncan L. Clinch Marina, constructed in 1933. Next, the highway also passes along the Open Space, a public year-round park that was formerly the Traverse City Light and Power Plant, demolished in 2005. Beyond Union Street, Grandview Parkway does not have any more busy intersections, while passing by more public beaches and volleyball courts. Finally, the highway reaches US 31/M-37 at Division Street, one of the busiest intersections in the county. This is where US 31/M-37 split off the concurrency, and M-22 begins. This highway has no intersections for , passing by many city parks and beaches, until reaching East Traverse Highway (County Line Road), where M-72 splits westward toward Empire. M-22 continues northward as Grandview Parkway for about until the parkway ends.  History  Grandview Parkway eastbound at Hall Street in Traverse City In 1953, a project was proposed to move traffic out of downtown Traverse City. It was to also to replace Bay Street and Front Street as the bayfront streets, as well as a former short street called \\"Barker Street\\" This project was greenlit, and in 1956, the parkway was opened to traffic. This highway ran alongside the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in its entirety. In latter years, this railway was removed and replaced with the Leelanau Trail and TART Trail. In 2017, the terminus of Garland Street in Traverse City was realigned from Grandview Parkway to Union Street, giving it a more \\"19th century look\\". This left Old Garland Street as a driveway to the headquarters of Traverse City's Tourism Bureau. Also in 2017, the Murchie Bridge, which carries Grandview Parkway over the Boardman River, was replaced due to age.  Future  Traverse City sign just north of the northern terminus of the parkway There have been proposals to add roundabouts in many locations on Division Street, including its northern terminus at Grandview Parkway. Another roundabout has been proposed at the Union Street intersection, which is one of the busiest in Grand Traverse County.

Led by Monty Finniston it investigated how well the professional institutions were serving their members and whether it was desirable to introduce statutory regulation of the industry. It recommended abolition of the Council of Engineering Institutions (CEI), the establishment of a statutory Engineering Authority to regulate the profession, and the introduction of engineer's degrees. After its publication in 1980 the then- Conservative government decided against statutory regulation but replaced the CEI with the Engineering Council (EC). The EC would later restrict admission to the status of chartered engineer to those with engineer's degrees. The EC's 2000 Hamilton Report stated that the Finniston Report had been unfairly labeled as dirigiste and that it had actually recommended little direct legislative control over the profession.  Background  The report had been commissioned by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) of the 1974‚Äì79 Labour government. The government recognised the level of dissatisfaction in the engineering industry with the Council of Engineering Institutions (CEI) and asked industrialist Monty Finniston to recommend changes. Finniston's terms included reviewing the extent that the CEI and the professional institutions were meeting the needs of engineers and technicians and the role the institutions played in educating and regulating their members. He was also asked to consider whether it was advantageous to introduce statutory regulation and licensing of engineers and whether any of the measures used by other countries were suitable for application in the UK. There was a concern over an anticipated shortage of engineers for the industry, particularly at the high-tech end, to be worsened by a demographic decline in the number of 18-year olds by the early 1980s. Finniston's committee comprised 17 members. It had originally intended to canvass opinion by visiting 100 of the country's engineering firms, but eventually only managed 33; the opinions did not form part of the report as they were gathered in confidential conditions. It visited Canada, the United States, Japan, France, West Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands to determine the international approach, and in each country found that the status of engineers was higher than that in the United Kingdom. It also found that in each of these countries the state was involved in the registration of engineers, with only the UK leaving the matter entirely in the hands of private institutions. Owing to dissent between members of the committee and the volume of evidence considered, the report was delivered to the DTI seven months late on 16 November 1979. It was published in January 1980 by Margaret Thatcher's government.  Recommendations  Finniston stated that the CEI was failing to promote engineering or to influence national policy. The CEI itself was devoid of a central purpose as its four largest members - the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE), Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE), Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) and the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) ‚Äì could not agree on a driving policy. Some of its members complained that the CEI was slow to implement change, with many decisions requiring unanimous consent from all 16 members. Finniston proposed radical changes: the abolition of the CEI and its replacement by a new statutory Engineering Authority (EA). This would assume responsibility for regulating membership and admission from the individual institutions. Membership grades were to be matched to the education level of members with grades corresponding to higher national certificate, bachelor's degree and master's degree levels. The report criticised the depth and breadth of education provided by the British universities, when compared with those of Western Europe. Finniston recommended the introduction of specific engineer's degree courses (MEng and BEng) to be used as a foundation for future chartered status.  Reception  The government decided not to implement Finniston's recommendation and chose to retain the independence of the institutions through self-regulation of membership. After discussion and negotiation with the institutions, it was decided to establish the Engineering Council as an overseeing body under a royal charter (not governed by parliamentary legislation as a statutory body would have been). This position was opposed by Finniston. The CEI rejected the findings of the report and instead recommended that three new bodies be established: one to register engineers in a similar manner to the General Medical Council; one to promote the profession and seek a change in the nation's attitude to engineering; and a third to act as the voice of the profession in influencing national policy. The four main institutions were initially supportive of Finniston's recommendation to establish the EA, although the ICE later reconsidered its position stating that civil engineering was best left outside of any common approach to engineering education and regulation. The Institution of Metallurgists supported the Finniston recommendations as did the Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employment Federation. The Institution of Plant Engineers welcomed increased co-operation between the engineering institutions but wanted to maintain self-regulation. The Institution of Industrial Managers supported mergers between engineering institutions suggesting that it could be combined with the Institution of Plant Engineers, the Institution of Production Engineers and the Institute of Management Services.  Legacy  Following its establishment, the Engineering Council implemented common systems for record continuing professional development across the engineering institutions, and the aligning of codes of professional practice. This brought engineering in line with accountants, town planners and surveyors which were the only professions at the time to require formal recording of CPD. Finniston also recommended the implementation schemes to increase the number of engineering and science students and attract more women and young people into the profession. This included the Women into Science and Engineering Campaign (WISE), established in 1984 under the leadership of Beryl Platt, Baroness Platt of Writtle, as a recommendation of the Finniston Report. The Finniston Report found that only 56% of respondents rated engineering or science as a \\"good\\" career choice for a woman, by 2000 this had increased to 72%. In 1992 the Engineering Council restricted chartered engineer status to those applicants who held BEng or MEng degrees. A level of mistrust arose between the council and the institutions over their lack of say in its governance. Over the following years the profession became more fragmented with more than 40 institutions representing the profession. However there is evidence that the industry has become more accessible, is perceived as more desirable and that salaries have increased in certain sectors. The report was the last in this aspect of the profession until the Engineering Council's 2000 Hamilton Report. In this paper Sir James Hamilton found that the Finniston Report had been unfairly labeled as dirigiste, and that Finniston had actually recommended little legislative control of the profession. The 2013 Professor John Perkins' Review of Engineering Skills was a similar review into the state of the engineering profession in the United Kingdom.

After the band split up in 1983, Mergia moved to the United States and began studying music at Howard University, during which time he discovered an accordion and began playing it. Initially intending to record a cassette of himself playing the accordion in a small studio belonging to an acquaintance at Howard, he also incorporated other instruments in the studio, such as a Rhodes piano and synthesiser. Using all three instruments and a drum machine, he recorded His Classical Instrument to showcase his mastery of the accordion, an instrument which reminded him of his youth ‚Äì and which had lost popularity in Ethiopia since the 1950s ‚Äì with the hopes of bringing it back to prominence. Via the inclusion of modern instruments, the album was also intended to mix the old accordion style with the modern technology of the United States. Originally released in Ethiopia on cassette by Kaifa Records, the album was a surprise hit when listeners warmed to its unusual sound, though, as was often the case with Mergia's music, the album was unheard outside of the country, and he soon slipped into obscurity. When Brian Shimkovitz, founder of American reissue label Awesome Tapes From Africa, discovered a copy of the album in Ethiopia in 2013, he hoped to re- release it on his label, and contacted Mergia, who greenlit the project. Upon its re-release in various formats by the label that same year, the album received critical acclaim, with Western critics complimenting its uniquely psychedelic and dreamy sound. The success of the album relaunched Mergia's international touring career, which had ceased several decades earlier, and brought him international recognition. The label would later re-release further cassettes of Mergia's music. Background Having settled in Addis Ababa at the age of 10, Hailu Mergia had grown up on traditional Oromo, Amhara and Tigrinya songbook melodies, and taught himself the accordion age 14. His mastering of the accordion, as well as the keyboard and his talent for \\"re- purposing folk songs into funkier modern melodies,\\" defined his contribution to popular music in Ethiopia. In the 1970s, Hailu Mergia was the keyboardist in the Walias Band, an Ethiopian jazz and funk band with a hard polyrhythmic funk sound influenced by western artists like King Curtis, Junior Walker and Maceo Parker. In the period, it was harder for working bands in the region to make a living, after Mengistu's Derg government imposed breaks to Addis Ababa's nightlife, but music was still being regularly recorded, and cassettes were the typical release format, given they were easy to duplicate and distribute. Due to the Derg dictatorship, censorship was often a problem for the area's musicians, but Mergia acknowledged one way around censorship was to only create instrumentals. He later noted: \\"When you sing or write lyrics you have to support the government, and if you don‚Äôt do that then you have a problem.\\" Ethiopian music was typically led by a vocalist, and fewer than five instrumental albums were released during the 'golden age' of Addis' music, one of which by was one of Mergia's landmark albums with the Walias Band, Tche Belew (1977). As a side project, Mergia joined the Dhalak Band around this period and recorded the cassette-only Wede Harer Guzo (1978) with them, a jazz-infused album with a dominance of improvisation. Mergia's organ work for the band was one of the Walias Band's key characteristics, but during a 1980s tour of the United States, Mergia and several other members decided to stay in the US, effectively ending the band's career, although their legacy in Ethiopia was strong by this point, especially via their 1977 instrumental \\"Muziqawi Silt.\\" It was only several years after moving to the US that Mergia recorded a new album, Hailu Mergia & His Classical Instrument, in 1985, during which point he was playing with the Zula Band. Hailu recorded the album alone in a small studio. The studio belonged to an acquaintance that Mergia met at Howard University, where he had begun studying music, and the impetus for the album was picking up an accordion, an \\"instrument he hadn't touched in decades.\\" Mergia said his initial plan for the album was to \\"just record [some] accordion for myself, just to listen,\\" but he ditched the plan when he \\"couldn't keep his hands off\\" the small studio's Rhodes electric piano and DX7 synthesiser too. He recorded the eleven, largely improvised tracks that make up the album in three days. Composition=Concept and instrumentation= The album is dominated by the accordion and was intended to help raise the instrument's popularity in Ethiopia. Mergia set out to create an album which merged the music of his youth with modern music technology. For the album, he worked alone and used his accordion, a Rhodes piano, a drum machine, and, according to contrasting accounts, a Yamaha DX7 keyboard or Moog synthesiser (or both), and arranged a set of old Ethiopian songs with the mostly modern selection of instruments. Writer Donal Dineen wrote that the album was a \\"step into the unknown,\\" given its fusion of a sound familiar to Mergia with \\"modern technology that was dramatically altering the musical landscape in the US.\\" Via its dominance on the instruments he listened to and perfected in his younger days, Mergia intended for the album to be an exercise in nostalgia. Music critic Robert Christgau wrote that the album recaptures the modal melodies of Mergia's youth. The accordion is one of the dominant instruments on the album, and the \\"classical instrument\\" referred to in the title. The instrument had not featured in the majority of popular Ethiopian music for decades, given that it had been usurped by amplified instruments since the accordion's 1950s heyday. Mergia felt that many people in Ethiopia had fond memories of the accordion and the popular songs that featured it, and intended the album to bring the instrument to prominence again. Via the inclusion of the electric and electronic instruments though, it was assured the album would not be a mere throwback to the older accordion style. On the album, the accordion has been said to resemble the squeezeboxes of the 1950s, thus being consistent with the accordion music Mergia grew up with. Nonetheless, Australian news website ABC felt the album had the electric organ at its core, and noted its influence from the Ethiopian jazz scene from which Mergia originated. =Musical style= Hailu Mergia & His Classical Instrument is an instrumental album, in which Mergia alternately solos in an Ethiopian style on either his accordion or the keyboard. Behind these solos, he uses the keyboard to create buzzy bass lines and the Rhodes piano to apply chords and texture, while the drum machine patterns refrain from deviating during the tracks, although Mergia occasionally augments the \\"rhythmic push\\" with a style of vocals \\"halfway between beatboxing and chanting.\\" The material takes from both traditional and contemporary Ethiopian songs, and Mergia matches Oromo, Amhara and Tigrinya melodies to \\"otherworldly flavors\\" styled in jazz and blues, balancing the iconic pentatonic modes and melodic shape of Ethiopian music with analog synthesisers. Beyond the modal melodies, other distinctive Ethiopian characteristics throughout the album include the tracks' triple metres and \\"three-against-four\\" rhythms. The result is an album that has been referred to as a fusion between traditional Ethiopian melodies and \\"blessed- out\\" electro-jazz. Several have described the music as psychedelic, with the Washington City Paper calling the album a \\"thoroughly psychedelic interpretation of traditional acoustic Ethiopian music.\\" Christgau disagreed with the notions of the album being psychedelic or futuristic, instead finding it to be \\"spare, nostalgic, and passing strange,\\" and describing it as a type of cocktail music that, unlike other examples of the genre, possesses a very different tune base and what he felt was \\"the necessity of reducing music Americans now know primarily from √âthiopiques horn bands to simple pattern, momentary idiosyncrasy, and painful longing.\\" ABC called the album a mix of \\"rigid pre-programmed rhythms, supple organ licks and left field synth whooshes.\\" The Wire described the album's sound as \\"Ethio-Kosmische,\\" while Joe Tangari of Pitchfork similarly described the album as the Ethiopian equivalent to German krautrock band Cluster. Given the album's modal accordion melodies accompanying squelchy synth bass and \\"rinky-dink rhythm box grooves,\\" parts of the album were said by The List to suggest a \\"DIY bedroom pop take on the great Mulatu Astatke's mellow yet mysterious Ethio-jazz.\\" \\"Belew Beduby\\" features a 6/8 beat boasting a swaying polyrhythm as well as quirky funk- styled synth riffs, and \\"Sewnetuwa\\" features a bassline reminiscent of later day chiptune music, with a \\"dueling\\" between the accordion and Yamaha DX7, while \\"Hebo Lale\\" adopts a faster tempo than other songs and a boogie feel. Release and rediscovery Mergia mailed the master recording of Hailu Mergia & His Classical Instrument to the Addis Ababa record label Kaifa Records, who released it on cassette in Ethiopia in 1985, with a cover that depicts Mergia half-smiling while surrounded by keyboards. The album was a surprise success in the country, and Ethiopian people phoned Mergia to ask him \\"What is this music?\\". Nonetheless, Mergia's output had always been and continued to be widely unheard outside of Ethiopia. Following the album's release, Mergia faded into relative obscurity. While he continued to play parties, restaurants and weddings with the Zula Band, the band broke up in 1992 or 1993 and he stopped playing live gigs at this point, mostly retiring from music. In January 2013, Brian Shimkovitz, founder of Awesome Tapes from Africa (an American label which reissues obscure African cassettes for a Western market), stumbled across a copy of Hailu Mergia & His Classical Instrument in a music shop in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, whose staff let him listen to many of the cassettes on sale. Shimkovitz \\"freaked out completely\\" when he heard it and listened to it twice in a row. He recalled: \\"It sounds like no other Ethiopian music I've heard. Analogue synths, a simple drum machine and accordion (and no vocals).\\" Hoping to re-release the album on his label, he set out to locate Mergia by Googling him, being surprised to quickly find his mobile number. By this point, Mergia had been working as a taxi driver in Washington for 10 years. He was very interested in working with Shimkovitz on the re-release. Awesome Tapes from Africa subsequently re-released Hailu Megia & His Classical Instrument on 25 June 2013 in the United States as a CD, LP, cassette and download. Shimkovitz said that the re-release \\"sold very well\\" and wrote that \\"people all over the world have responded positively\\" to the album's unusual style. It was with the re-release that Mergia's output became better known to the wider world. Having not played live for some 20 years, Mergia missed touring, and the album's re-release caused the 67-year-old musician to wonder what performing music outside his Washington home would be like. Nonetheless, the success of the album's re-release allowed Mergia to relaunch his international touring career. Mergia built a friendship with Shimkovitz, and following the success of the re-release, Awesome Tapes from Africa re-released two more Mergia albums, 1977's Tche Belew (an instrumental jazz album by Mergia and the Walias Band) in 2015 and the 1978 cassette Wede Harer Guzo in 2016. Mergia's first album of new material since 2003, Lala Belu, was released on the label in February 2018. Reception and legacy Praise greeted Hailu Mergia & His Classical Instrument in the West following its 2013 re-release. Joe Tangari of Pitchfork was favourable, calling the album's sound \\"difficult to describe.\\" He wrote: \\"The music is simple and straightforward, accomplished but not showy. It feels at once rural, nostalgic, and futuristic. Replace the drum machine with people clapping, and you‚Äôd be a hair‚Äôs breadth from an ethnographic recording.\\" Daniel Spicer in The Wire called the album \\"a prescient yet ancient sound that proposes a unique kind of Ethio-Kosmische.\\" Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau gave the album an A‚Äì score, indicating \\"the kind of garden-variety good record that is the great luxury of musical micromarketing and overproduction. Anyone open to its aesthetic will enjoy more than half its tracks.\\" Stewart Smith of The List called the re-release \\"another gem\\" from the Awesome Tapes from Africa label, and complimented the album's dreamy, blessed-out sound. Chris Richards of The Washington Post recalled how the cassette \\"meshed the sound of a forgotten folk instrument with strange, futuristic timbres\\" and called it an album \\"that simultaneously pointed toward Ethiopia‚Äôs musical past and future.\\" In 2015 The Irish Times named the album a \\"Sunken Treasure\\" and called it \\"a deeply progressive meditation on something historical and personal. The hypnotic tunes are soothed by occasional flourishes of gentle songcraft from a voice so warm it could have been stirred up on some savannah breeze aeons ago.\\" Jon Pareles of the New York Times wrote: \\"With the unswerving patterns from the drum machine, the music came across as an eerie, isolated rumination on a place and time Mr. Mergia had left behind, with its Ethiopian modes and melodies transplanted to a modern terra incognita.\\" Fact Magazine later ranked the album at number 5 on their list of \\"The 50 best reissues of 2013,\\" where they called it \\"serpentine Ethiopian jazz\\" which \\"trades in the usual folk instruments for big fat beefy synth leads. Comfort food, prime for scoffing.\\" The album captured the point in which Ethiopian music shifted away from acoustic-based performances and more towards recordings incorporating an increasing amount of synthesised elements. While this general shift in the country's music was criticised by some, Mergia's initial experimentation with instrumental, \\"switched-on\\" solo reinterpretations of Ethiopian folk and popular music contributes what Shimkovitz called \\"a singular feeling dripping in ambiance and a very human emotional energy.\\" April Clare Welsh of Fact Magazine called it \\"a vital document of Ethiopian musical history.\\" By the time of the album's re-release, synthesizers and drum machines had become common instruments within Ethiopian pop music, albeit in a different fashion than that on His Classical Instrument. Tangari felt one of the aspects which separates the Mergia album from other Ethiopian music \\"is the fact that it was made in solitude, and specifically out of longing for a vanished past. It's introverted in a way very little other music from the country is. It's also not quite like anything else you‚Äôve ever heard.\\" Shimkovitz calls the album \\"one of my all-time favourite tapes.\\" Track listing=Original cassette release= ;Side one # \\"·à∏·àû·äï·àü·äì·ã¨\\" # \\"·à∞·ãç·äê·â∑\\" # \\"·àã·àé·ã¨\\" # \\"·ãà·åà·äî\\" # \\"·àÄ·à™ ·àò·à© ·àò·à©\\" ;Side two # * \\"·ä†·àù·à®·ãç ·ã∞·àù·âÄ·ãç\\" # \\"·ä†·äï·â∫·äï ·ä†·àã·ã≠ ·ä†·àà·äù\\" # \\"·ä†·àù·â£·à∞·àç\\" # \\"·àÑ·â¶ ·àã·àå\\" # \\"·â†·àà·ãç ·â†·ã±·â£·ã≠\\" # \\"·àΩ·àà·àã\\" =CD version (2013)= #\\"Shemonmuanaye\\" ‚Äì 6:40 #\\"Sewnetuwa\\" ‚Äì 6:08 #\\"Laloye\\" ‚Äì 5:56 #\\"Wegene\\" ‚Äì 5:29 #\\"Hari Meru Meru\\" ‚Äì 5:46 #\\"Amrew Demkew\\" ‚Äì 6:32 #\\"Anchin Alay Alegn\\" ‚Äì 6:27 #\\"Ambasel\\" ‚Äì 3:49 #\\"Hebo Lale\\" ‚Äì 4:43 #\\"Belew Beduby\\" ‚Äì 4:25 #\\"Shilela\\" ‚Äì 3:24 Personnel *Hailu Mergia ‚Äì accordion, keyboard, electric piano, drum machine References 1985 albums Psychedelic music albums Jazz albums by Ethiopian artists Electronic albums Nu jazz albums Worldbeat albums ","title":"Hailu Mergia &amp; His Classical Instrument"},{"id":"56526958","text":"My Little Marquise (French: Ma petite marquise) is a 1937 French comedy film directed by Robert P√©guy and starring Josseline Ga√´l, Paul Pauley and Fernand Fabre.R√®ge p.803 Cast * Jacotte as La petite Jacotte * Josseline Ga√´l as Monique Cormier * Paul Pauley as Adolphe Cormier * Andr√© Bervil as Pierre Mareuil * Fernand Fabre as Fran√ßois Mareuil * Fran√ßois Rodon as Le petit Julien * Yvette Andr√©yor as La tante * Charlotte Clasis as Nounou * Jacques Derives as Antoine * Jean Brochard as Godard  References  Bibliography  * R√®ge, Philippe.

They are descended from Cherokee who had migrated to Texas prior to the Cherokee War of 1839 under Duwa'li, or The Bowl.Duwal'li TSHA online; They were later joined by members of other remnant southeast tribes, such as the Yowani Choctaw, Chickasaw and Muscogee. After the Cherokee War in 1839, the Cherokee sought refuge in Monclova, Mexico, to evade military action by the Republic of Texas, which was trying to expel Indians from East Texas. Led by Chicken Trotter, also known as Devereaux Jarrett Bell, the group fought a guerilla campaign against the Republic of Texas from Mexico throughout 1840 to 1842. The Cherokee saw action in Corpus Christi, San Patricio and later followed General Adri√°n Woll in his occupation of San Antonio De Bexar. The Cherokee and allied Yowani, along with Mexican regulars, defeated the Dawson Expedition, but they were defeated in turn by Texas Army forces at the Battle of Salado Creek. With the signing of the Treaty of Birds Fort, hostilities ended between the Republic of Texas and the Texas Cherokee, who were granted formal recognition in Texas. These Cherokee were soon joined by other Cherokee from Indian Territory, from the Old Settler and Ridge Party groups. Due to internal political conflicts resulting from the forced removal from their eastern homeland, culminating in the Starr War, the Old Settler and Ridge Party sought a separation from the dominant Ross faction of the Cherokee Nation. In 1844 United States President James K. Polk issued an Executive Order for these two bands to seek lands suitable to settle on in Texas. Following the establishment of the community some six miles south of present-day Kilgore, Texas, the Cherokee were soon joined by Yowani Choctaw, intermarried Chickasaw and McIntosh Party Creek Indians. Today the band is made up of those descendants that continue to reside there. The band's current headquarters is in Kilgore, Texas, with significant populations near New London, Overton, Arp and Troup, Texas. History Descendants of the four American Indian tribes that make up the Mount Tabor Indian Community have a shared experience in the colonization of the American Southeast by Europeans. They suffered encroachment and Indian Removal through the 1830s. From different language families, the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw and Creek refugees came together in Texas, forming a community. It was initially dominated numerically by Cherokee Indians, however, since 1900 the majority of the band have been of ethnic Choctaw and Chickasaw ancestry. The four tribes that combined as the Mount Tabor Indian Community since the late 19th century migrated in stages to east Texas. The first were survivors of the Cherokee War. With the violation of the Treaty of Bowles Village on February 23, 1836, between the Consultation of the Republic of Texas and the Texas Cherokee, the Texas Army ruthlessly pushed the Cherokee and allied Lenape (Delaware) and Shawnee Indians from the treaty lands, scattering them to multiple locations. A band of Cherokee sought refuge in Monclova, Coahuila, Mexico, led by Fox Fields and Chicken Trotter, who was also known as Devereaux Jarrett Bell. From there, along with their Mexican liaison, Vicente C√≥rdova, the Texas Cherokee fought a guerrilla war against the Republic of Texas from 1840 until they ceased hostilities with the signing of the Treaty of Birds Fort.Republic of Texas Treaties; Treaty of Birds Fort September 29, 1843, Texas State Historical Society, Austin, Texas A combined force of Texas Cherokee, Yowani and Mexican militia saw action against the Republic at San Patricio and Corpus Christi, with the final confrontations coming with General Adri√°n Woll's invasion of San Antonio de Bexar in September 1842. There, they were involved in the defeat of the Dawson Expedition but lost at the Battle of Salado Creek. Some eighteen Cherokee were killed along with Vicente C√≥rdova, their Mexican military liaison. Shortly after this, with Sam Houston returning as President of the Republic of Texas, they sought peace, which was realized at Birds Fort. During this same period, the larger Cherokee Nation had carried their internal rivalries after removal to their new lands in Indian Territory. The followers of Major Ridge, who had formed the Treaty or Ridge Party that signed the Treaty of New Echota, clashed with the new arrivals who came after the Trail of Tears and forced removal by the United States. The followers of Principal Chief John Ross had initially opposed removal, and carried out their capital sentence against persons who had ceded their lands, as they saw it. The Ridge Party had accepted the treaty and removal because they thought to do otherwise was to risk the destruction of the greater Cherokee Nation. A third Cherokee faction were the Old Settlers, who had earlier migrated to the west, first to Arkansas and then to Indian Territory, before the signing of the Treaty of New Echota. They had established a functioning government separate from their eastern kinsmen. While the Old Settler and Ridge Party had cooperated, the arrival of the much larger Ross faction threw all of Indian Territory into chaos. After the Ross faction Cherokee assassinated Major Ridge and some of his allies, carrying out what they considered a capital sentence, the Old Settler and Ridge Party party factions sought relief. First, they proposed a division of the Cherokee Nation, with the southern part going to the Old Settlers and Ridge Party, and the north to the Ross supporters, forming two separate Cherokee governments. That idea was rejected by the federal government. But in 1844, United States President James K. Polk issued an Executive Order granting both Old Settler and Ridge Party factions permission to send a delegation to Texas to find land suitable for them to settle on. The Republic of Texas was still a separate nation and had its own ideas about desirable settlers. The arrival of the immigrant Cherokee led to a tense period. It had been only five years since the Cherokee War and a little over a year since Chicken Trotter had signed a new treaty with Texas at Birds Fort. The Old Settler-Ridge Party delegation was led by John Harnage, James Starr, J.L. Thompson, and John Adair Bell. Also known as John \\"Jack\\" Bell, he was a brother of Chicken Trotter, and had been one of the signatories of the Treaty of New Echota. These two groups met near present-day Waco in mid-1844. At that time, the Cherokee were prohibited from owning land in the Republic of Texas. To solve this problem, Benjamin Franklin Thompson, the European-American husband of Annie Martin, a Cherokee woman, purchased of land for the band near what is now Kilgore, Texas. Her father John Martin served as the First Chief Justice of the Cherokee Nation. With this purchase and a similar purchase to the south of the Thompson land by Jesse Mayfield, another European American married to a Cherokee woman, the Cherokee effectively occupied a new homeland. Mayfield's wife was Sarah Starr, the great granddaughter of Beloved Woman (also known as Nancy Ward). By the summer of 1845 families began the trek to Texas and safety. Joined by Cherokee from Monclova, Mexico, the Mount Tabor Indian Community was founded. The original Mount Tabor village was located some six miles south of where present-day Kilgore developed in Rusk County, Texas. It appears to have been established on or near the former village of Chief Richard Fields, which had been led by his son Fox Fields at the time of the Cherokee War. Annie Martin- Thompson was the niece of Chief Fields. Between 1845 and 1850, numerous Cherokee families settled in Mount Tabor and Bellview, a settlement they developed. By 1850 families of Yowani Choctaw and related Chickasaw, who had been living in southern Rusk County, came to seek refuge with the Cherokee. A group of Muscogee (Creek) of the McIntosh Party also headed south from Indian Territory after being threatened by an anti-removal Creek leader named Tuskeenhaw. The McIntosh Party were a Creek pro-removal group similar to the Cherokee Ridge Party. The Choctaw were led by Jeremiah Jones, followed by Archibald Thompson. The Muscogee were led by William and Thomas Berryhill, whose families had been tied to Broken Arrow and Horse Path towns in the former Creek Nation in the Southeast. With the annexation of Texas into the United States of America, Indians were allowed to own lands in the state. John Adair Bell soon purchased land just south of the Benjamin F. Thompson lands. He wrote in a letter to his brother-in-law Stand Watie, \\"I call my place Mount Taber\\", listing his address as Mount Taber, Texas. This was the first documented reference to the community. As the community grew, it flourished. That would change as the members became caught up in the American Civil War. American Civil War The entire band allied with the Confederate States, with most Cherokee serving with General Stand Watie, who had lived for short periods at Mount Tabor. His wife Sarah Caroline Bell-Watie lived there in 1863 with her sister Nancy Bell and brother-in-law George Harlan Starr. While most of the Cherokee males of Mount Tabor served under Watie and former Mount Tabor resident Colonel William Penn Adair with the Second Cherokee Mounted Rifles, some chose to serve with other Texas units. John Martin Thompson organized units at Bellview, which were composed of Cherokee as well as Choctaw and intermarried whites. The band suffered greatly during the war. They suffered war-related shortages, and a number of Cherokee, mostly women and children related to members of Watie's command, fled to Rusk County for refuge deep in Texas. The band's limited resources were strained. John Martin Thompson Following the war and the death of John Ross in 1866, the Cherokee Nation passed a \\"right of return\\" for members who wanted to rejoin the Nation. Between 1866 and 1890, more than 80% of the Cherokee left Mount Tabor to return to the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory. The Choctaw and Muscogee had different reactions after the war. Most of the Berryhill and related families were scattered throughout Texas and western Louisiana, with groups in Limestone and Angelina counties in Texas and Natchitoches Parish in Louisiana. Another sizable group headed north to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, putting down roots near what is known as Eufaula, Oklahoma. The Choctaw met with considerable resistance from authorities in Indian Territory. Dawes Commission Some Yowani Choctaw had left Texas shortly after their village on Attoyac Bayou was attacked and eleven members massacred by white vigilantes from Nacogdoches in 1840. They settled in the southern Chickasaw Nation not far from Ardmore, Oklahoma near Houani Creek. Around 1885 William Clyde Thompson, along with John Thurston Thompson Jr., Winburn Jones and Martin Luther Thompson, led Choctaw from Rusk and neighboring Smith County, Texas to the Ardmore area in the Chickasaw Nation. They wanted to register as members in the Choctaw Nation during enrollment on the Dawes Rolls.United States Department of the Interior, Secretary of the Interior-Choctaw Citizenship Cases, #4 William C. Thompson et al., pp. 151‚Äì157 While all the Texas Choctaw relocating to Indian Territory were initially enrolled on the Final Roll of the Choctaw Nation, they were later stricken. Initially listed as Mississippi Choctaw, they were later changed to MCR (Mississippi Choctaw Rejected). Tribal officials said they no longer belonged, as they and the related Jena Choctaw in Louisiana, had not been in Mississippi for multiple generations. But their ancestors had been parties to previous Choctaw treaties with the US while still residing in Mississippi. The Department of the Interior acknowledged the Choctaw ancestry but the Choctaw Advisory Board wanted to admit only those relocating from Mississippi. The Jena Band of Choctaw Indians in Louisiana faced the same rejection. It was not until 1995 that the Jena Choctaw were finally federally recognized as a distinct tribe.Letter of April 4, 1905 from Thomas Ryan, First Assistant Secretary Indian Affairs to Commissioner to the Five Civilized Tribes, Muskogee, Indian Territory, re: William C. Thompson et al. MCR 341, MCR 7124, MCR 581 and MCR 458 Martin Luther Thompson and others returned to Rusk County, living there for the remainder of their lives. Those who had stayed with William Clyde Thompson and settled near the town of Marlow, fought the issue all the way to the United States Supreme Court. The court sided with these Choctaw, and they were entered on a reinstatement list, restoring their Choctaw citizenship. Some 70 Texas Choctaw from Mount Tabor were recognized as \\"Choctaw by Blood\\" and citizens of that nation.Oklahoma Historical Society, Records of the Department of the Interior, Laws, Decisions and Regulations Affecting the work of the Commissioner to the Five Civilized Tribes 1893-1906, pp. 130‚Äì138 But unlike the Cherokee, most Choctaw and Chickasaw of Mount Tabor remained in the east Texas tribal community. During this same period, Caleb Starr Bean, who served as the Mount Tabor community Chief, sought to gain enrollment on the Dawes Roll for the remaining Mount Tabor people. He was unsuccessful as the enrollment was based on physical residence in the Cherokee Nation. Chief Caleb Starr Bean, ca. 1875, Rusk County, Texas Enrollment on the Guion Miller Roll, which was a payment roll based upon previous treaties, was open to all Cherokee listed on the 1835 Cherokee census taken at the time of Indian Removal. Those who were or had ancestors among the original Texas Cherokee, as well as the Choctaw and Muscogee, were not eligible. Those who did not remove to Texas until after the Cherokee arrived in Indian Territory in 1839, were eligible. Chief Caleb Bean worked diligently to insure that all known Mount Tabor Cherokee people who were eligible, had a chance to apply for Guion Miller enrollment. He died in 1902 before the roll was closed, but his brother John Ellis Bean became the next community Chief and took over his efforts. Chief John Bean kept the tribal organization together under what were increasingly hard times. The land was not known for producing well. The forests had been largely harvested by lumber companies owned by the Thompsons. The Thompson and Tucker Lumber Company, owned by John Martin Thompson, dominated in the region.American Lumberman Biographies (1908) http://www.ttarchive.com/library/Biographies/Thompson-JM_AL.html Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands Shortly after the Civil War, former Mount Tabor resident William Penn Adair, reorganized the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands. This organization, which was started in Mount Tabor in the 1850s, was established to pursue redress from the violations of the Treaty of Bowles Village in 1836. The State of Texas initially offered some fifteen million acres of Texas Panhandle land, on the condition that the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands drop any further legal action related to the treaty. Adair refused. The lands now occupied by the Texas Cherokees had become a new homeland. Many of the community's ancestors were buried there, and the people were doing relatively well in East Texas. Whey they assessed the lands offered, they took into account that these 15 million acres were occupied by the Comanche and Kiowa peoples. They would have reacted to Tabor or other Cherokee as intruders. War would have been inevitable. Adair thought this was unacceptable. Before the Texas revolution, the Mexican government had offered similar land, in order for the Texas Cherokee to move west and form a barrier to the Comanche, Lipan Apache, and other tribes. That had been rejected by The Bowl and Adair followed suit. Following the war, with a Confederate Cherokee delegation in Washington, William Adair tried to gain approval for Confederate Cherokees to be allowed to return to the treaty lands in east Texas. It was unsuccessful. Following the death of Stand Watie in 1871, Adair reorganized the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands (TCAB). He would lead the organization assisted by Clement Neely Vann. At this point, Mount Tabor was deeply involved in the organization. Adair, who needed more money than that supplied by John Martin Thompson, reached out to the Fields family for financial support for continued legal action. From 1871 to 1963, the TCAB filed suits in an effort to gain more compensation for treaty violations. The first were filed against the State of Texas from 1871‚Äì1875, after which the state later changed its constitution to block further attempts. The TCAB sought land through filing liens in Rusk and Smith counties in 1914, and reached the United States Supreme Court on appeal in 1920‚Äì21, and the Indian Claims Commission in 1949‚Äì1953. The suit of 1963 was led chiefly by the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and did not include the Mount Tabor Indian Community. Following the deaths of William Adair and Clement Vann, John Martin Thompson took over the Chairmanship of the Executive Committee of Mount Tabor. He remained in that position until his death 1907. John Ellis Bean then served both as the local community Chief and TCAB Executive Committee Chairman. In 1915, at a meeting of the General Assembly held in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, with nearly 500 Texas Cherokee present, Jake Claude Muskrat was elected the next TCAB Executive Committee Chairman. He was the first TCAB Chairman who had not lived at Mount Tabor. Muskrat, a descendant of Chief Richard Fields, was succeeded in 1939 by William Wayne Keeler, known as W.W. Keeler. U.S. President Harry Truman appointed Keeler as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation in 1949. He served in both capacities with the Cherokee Nation and TCAB until 1972, when the Cherokee Nation established a constitution for electoral government. After the death of Thompson, the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands became more influenced by the majority of Cherokee in Oklahoma. During the 1920 effort to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, a major schism developed between TCAB attorney George Fields and Texas leader Martin Luther Thompson. Fields contended that this was a Cherokee Nation effort. Fields wanted the Choctaw to be excluded from the Cherokee Nation. He struck the word \\"Choctaw\\" out of his papers related to the case.Gilcrease Museum, Tulsa, Papers of George W. Fields 1920-1921 He left the word Jawanie (Yowani), included in the original treaty, but Martin Thompson's believed that not all Mount Tabor Choctaw (including his wife) were Yowani. Fields tried to push out the Mount Tabor descendants, but stopped short due to pressures by Claude Muskrat and John Ellis Bean. Texas Oil Boom In Texas, the community maintained its local leadership. Following the death of John Ellis Bean in 1927, J. Malcolm Crim took over as leader, with Martin Luther Thompson as his second. The Great Depression hit the area hard, but was dramatically relieved by the discovery of oil on October 3, 1930 by Columbus M. \\"Dad\\" Joiner, at Daisy Bradford #3 near Kilgore, and soon thereafter at Lou Della Crim #1. This was followed by many more in areas occupied by the Tabor people. Lou Della Thompson-Crim was the daughter of John Martin Thompson. This discovery changed her life and many others forever. The 1930 oil boom was a two-edged sword for the Mount Tabor Community. It lifted up many of the band out of poverty, but the newfound wealth destroyed traditional indigenous culture, transforming it overnight. As a businessman, Malcolm Crim did well for the community, ensuring that many descendants from Kilgore to Troup were not taken advantage of by the abundance of less than scrupulous individuals who flooded into tribal areas. Over a four-week period Kilgore went from a sleepy town of 500, with a sizable Native population, to a city of 10,000, made up of rough migrants and speculators. Change was inevitable even with Malcolm Crim as the first mayor of Kilgore. By 1933, Crim was focused on his own business interests. Foster Trammell Bean became the next community Chief. Foster Bean was the grandson of Chief John Ellis Bean. He served as a local attorney, judge, and as mayor of Kilgore for twenty years. He maintained a good relationship with W.W. Keeler, but served only intermittently on the TCAB Executive Committee. With the death of Martin Luther Thompson in 1946, all local leadership was concentrated under Judge Bean. 1972 to present In 1972, as the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma was reorganizing and preparing to elect its first Principal Chief since statehood, it was becoming more politically distant from the Mount Tabor Community. Keeler had been reappointed Principal Chief by every U.S. President from Truman to Nixon. In anticipation of more changes and with Native American activism focused on local control, he resigned as Chairman of the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands. Foster Bean assumed all responsibilities, making the TCAB again reflect only a local Texas organization. With the approval of the 1975 Cherokee Nation constitution, the TCAB ceased to exist in Oklahoma without a vote. Since, it has been active only in Texas. Some Oklahoma Cherokee have continued to serve on the Executive Committee, such as Mack Starr and George Bell, but after 1980 all Executive Committee members have been tied to Mount Tabor in Texas only. Judge Foster Bean served as Chairman of the Executive Committee of the TCAB until 1988. J.C. Thompson was appointed by the Committee to replace him.Minutes to meeting TCAB- September 10, 1988, Kilgore Country Club, Kilgore, Gregg County, Texas, Bean remained a member of the Executive Committee, which included Billy Bob Crim, R. Nicholas Hearne, and Saunders Gregg. Thompson first addressed the community's standing as a recognized tribe. Secondly, he suggested changes to the name of the organization. The organization no longer used \\"Mount Tabor\\" and was known as the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands. Since the Executive Committee saw that the TCAB as the dual state organization, which after 1975 only remained viable in Texas. The committee proposed the name\\" Texas Band of Cherokee, Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians\\". That, and the proposed \\"Texas Band of Cherokee Indians\\" were both rejected by the General Assembly, made up of all adult members. The Choctaw descendants were offended by the latter proposal, they felt slighted, even though many are both Choctaw and Cherokee. The compromise in 1992 was to return to the band's original name, plus retaining the TCAB title. Since then the official name has been the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands of the Mount Tabor Indian Community. With the explosion of fraudulent groups claiming to be \\"Cherokee Tribes\\", the Executive Committee in 1998 no longer referred to the community by the TCAB title, but as Mount Tabor. The Executive Committee and General Assembly do not consider the community to be either \\"Cherokee\\" tribe, Choctaw, Chickasaw, nor Muscogee, but rather a combination of peoples who have are an interrelated band by blood, marriage and history. J.C. Thompson served as Chairman until 1998, when Terry Jean Easterly was selected as the first woman to lead the community. Easterly is also the first leader who has not had Cherokee ancestry. She is Choctaw, Chickasaw and Creek, a descendant of both the Thompson-McCoy and Jones families through Arthur Thompson, brother of William C. Thompson. She served from 1998 to 2000 and was succeeded by Peggy Dean-Atwood, a descendant of Archibald Thompson, who also had no Cherokee ancestry. Atwood served through 2001. After her resignation, J.C. Thompson became Chairman for the second time. He served until August 2018, when he was succeeded by William Ellis \\"Billy\\" Bean, the great-grandson of Chief John Ellis Bean. Chairman Bean was suspended by the Mount Tabor Tribal Court from office after having served 13 months on September 2, 2019.Tribal Court Case No. SC-2019-07-01, Mount Tabor Indian Community et al vs William Ellis Bean et al, Rusk County Clerks Office, Henderson, Texas He was succeeded by Cheryl Aleane Giordano, the third woman to hold the position. Ms. Giordano is a descendant of the Thompson-McCoy family and is of Choctaw and Chickasaw descent. She had previously served as Operations Coordinator on the Mount Tabor Executive Committee. Mount Tabor Indian Community In 1978 the band set up its first by-laws that were distinct from the 1925 Texas Cherokee and Associate Band by-laws. In 1998, the band approved a new constitution. In 2017 they approved another constitution, part of their effort to meet federal standards for self-government and to gain federal recognition as a tribe by the Secretary of Interior. in their Federal Acknowledgment Project. The band started seeking federal recognition in 1990 but the project was tabled in 1992, in part due to a misunderstanding of the criteria established by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (in consultation with tribes). The band revived its current Federal project in 2015. The Mount Tabor Indian Community in 2017 was one of five tribes recognized by the State of Texas.http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Actions.aspx?LegSess=85R&Bill;=SCR25 Three of the other Texas tribes: the Alabama-Coushatta, The Tigua of Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, and the Traditional Kickapoo, have gained federal recognition. The Lipan Apache Tribe of Texas, like Mount Tabor, is recognized only by the state. In the early 21st century, the band holds an annual reunion usually in either Kilgore or Troup. It maintains strong connections to three of their traditional cemeteries, the Asbury Indian Cemetery near Overton, the Thompson Cemetery at Laird Hill, and the Mount Tabor Indian Cemetery in rural Rusk County. Additionally, the band publishes a quarterly newspaper, The Mount Tabor Phoenix, for its nearly 600 citizens. Religion While certain ceremonies including stomp dances are continued, the people gradually absorbed Christianity, practicing primarily Protestant forms. As the Tabor people settled in this area between 1845 and 1850, their beliefs initially reflected tribal identities. The religions adopted by tribes related to their near European-American neighbors and activities of missionaries. To the north (Kilgore area) the Cherokee followed the Presbyterian faith, while in the south (New London to Troup), the predominant faith among the community was Methodist. In the late 19th century and well into the twentieth, the community was influenced by Reverend Evan Fletcher Thompson (Choctaw-Chickasaw), who left the Methodist Church for the Nazarene faith. Many churches throughout southern Smith and northwestern Rusk counties were started by Reverend Thompson. Today's band is a diverse group religiously. Some members have tried to revive elements of the historic faiths of the southeastern peoples, and a few are involved with the Native American Church. The majority are affiliated with mainline Protestant faiths. The Southern Baptists and Church of Christ have attracted members, making inroads within more traditional families. The Crim family of Mount Tabor donated the funds for the First Presbyterian Church's Opus 1173 pipe organ. The music from this organ continues to be heard in services today. The First Presbyterian Church in Kilgore is historically the one most tied to Mount Tabor people. Tribal government 1845‚Äì1871: The Tribal Government of the Mount Tabor Indian Community had a Community Chief, with the citizenry making up a General Assembly. 1871‚Äì1907: The community maintained a Community Chief, but other larger activities were dealt with by a Chief and later Chairman of an Executive Committee made up by both descendants in Texas and Oklahoma. Local decisions were still dealt with locally by a General Assembly. 1907‚Äì1945: The Community Chief dealt with most issues but the General Assembly was split between Kilgore, Texas, Tahlequah, Oklahoma and later Bartlesville, Oklahoma. In the 1915 General Assembly meeting in Tahlequah, Oklahoma with nearly 500 in attendance, Jake Claude Muskrat was elected the first TCAB Chairman that did not nor had not lived at Mount Tabor. He was a direct descendant of Texas Cherokee Chief Richard Fields. The 1925 General Assembly, one of the largest on record, had an attendance of well over 500 and was held in Miami, Oklahoma. The Chairman of the Executive Committee was the Chief Operating Officer. 1945‚Äì1972: The General Assembly was split, but the Thompson Reunion Committee led by Otha Bradford (Brad) Thompson and his brother, Templeton Altman (Temp) Thompson established and controlled the annual meetings through 2001. TCAB activities were almost exclusively handled out of Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Local business issues were still dealt with through Foster Bean. 1972‚Äì1998: The government returned to a more traditional form with all activity out of Kilgore, Texas and a general Assembly meeting annually. 1998‚Äì2017: A constitution ratified in 1998 established a three- tiered government, enlarging the Executive Committee from five members, which it had been since 1871 and making it a seven-member body. The General Assembly remained the same and a new branch was added, a Tribal Court, with Judge Saunders Gregg being the initial Chief Justice. 2017‚ÄìPresent: With a new constitution adopted in August 2017, the Mount Tabor Indian Community reduced the Executive Committee to a five-member body, consisting of the Tribal Chairman; Deputy Chairman, Secretary, Treasurer and Operations Coordinator. The Tribal Court remained a three-member body. The biggest change that the General Assembly voted on in 2016, was making it easier for speedy decisions related to the Federal Acknowledgment Project and designing a system that would be acceptable to the Secretary of the Interior with hopefully few changes. The General Assembly was phased out and a new seven-member Tribal Council would be set in place by June 1, 2018. The Tribal Council is divided into five districts consisting of; (1) Kilgore District; (2) Overton-Arp District; (3) Sand Hill District; (4) Screech Owl Bend District; and (5) New London District. There are also two At-Large Districts; (6) At-Large District One; representing members living outside of the tri-county area (Gregg, Rusk and Smith) but still in the State of Texas and finally (7) At-Large District Two, comprising all enrolled members living outside of the State of Texas. Citizenship Mount Tabor citizenship (membership) is limited to lineal descendants of six extended families, represented by specific progenitors whose family remained within or in contact with the Mount Tabor Indian Community from 1850 to the present. The six primary progenitors are: 1\\\\. Annie Martin-Thompson, a Cherokee Indian and her husband Benjamin Franklin Thompson; 2\\\\. John Ellis Bean and his wife Henrietta Cloud Dannenberg-Bean, both Cherokee Indians; 3\\\\. Nannie Sabina Harnage-Bacon a Cherokee Indian and her husband John Dana Bacon; 4\\\\. Margaret McCoy-Thompson, a Choctaw & Chickasaw Indian and her husband Henry Thompson through their sons: 4.a Henry Thompson Jr and his wife Percilla Jackson-Thompson, a Choctaw Indian (only his descendants that settled in Rusk, Smith or Gregg counties) 4.b Archibald Thompson and his wives Elizabeth Jackson-Thompson, a Choctaw Indian; Nancy Islea, ancestry unknown; Anna Strong Thompson, non-Indian (only his descendants that settled in Rusk, Smith or Gregg counties) 4.c William Thompson and his wife Elizabeth Jones Mangum-Thompson, a Choctaw Indian (all of his descendants, including those that relocated to Trinity and Angelina counties as long as they can document continued contact with the community); 5\\\\. Samuel Jones aka Nashoba, a Choctaw Indian (only his descendants that settled in Rusk, Smith, Gregg counties); 6\\\\. Martha Elizabeth Derrisaw- Berryhill (Durouzeaux), a Muscogee-Creek Indian and her husband John Berryhill, a Catawba Indian, (only his descendants that settled in Rusk, Smith, Gregg counties). Other families may qualify based upon lineal descent from an ancestor(s) who were part of the historical community but are now members of the Cherokee Nation; Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; Chickasaw Nation; Jena Band of Choctaw Indians or Muscogee-Creek Nation. These families are limited to parts of the Adair, Bell, Buffington, Fish and Starr Cherokee families. The Mount Tabor Indian Community is a lineal descendant band that does not have a minimum tribal blood quantum for citizenship.

It was the violation of this treaty that led directly to the Cherokee War of 1839. The treaty included all of Cherokee and Smith counties, the northwestern part of Rusk, northeastern Van Zandt and southern Gregg (formed from Rusk County in 1873) counties.Republic of Texas Treaties; Treaty of Bowles Village February 23, 1836, Texas State Historical Society, Austin, Texas *Treaty of Bird's Fort with the Republic of Texas, September 29, 1843 Ending hostilities among several Texas tribes, including the Texas Cherokees as negotiated by Chicken Trotter also known as Devereaux Jarrett Bell.

This treaty, honored by the State of Texas following annexation, has never been abrogated by the Congress of the United States and in theory is still valid. *Treaty of Tehuacana Creek with the Republic of Texas, October 9, 1844 An additional treaty was made in which Chicken Trotter \\"Devereaux Jarrett Bell\\" and Wagon Bowles were involved, the latter being the son of Texas Cherokee Chief Bowles also known as Duwa'li or the Bowl. This treaty was approved by the Texas Senate only. Chicken Trotter and his brother John Adair Bell (the latter a signer of the Treaty of New Echota) were part of the founding families of the Mount Tabor Indian Community in Rusk County, Texas.Republic of Texas Treaties; Treaty of Tehuacana Creek October 9, 1844, Texas State Historical Society, Austin, Texas *Second Treaty of Tehuacana Creek with the Republic of Texas, August 27 to September 25, 1845 The Council of Tehuacana Creek was the last official contact between the Republic of Texas and many of its tribes. This treaty was never ratified as Texas was soon to be annexed into the United States of America. In this treaty Wagon Bowles is acknowledged as Chief of the Cherokees, whereas Chicken Trotter is titled Captain.

During the First World War, he studied in Geneva, where he worked with Willi M√ºnzenberg. At the beginning of the 1920s, he served as Political Director of the Young Communist League of Germany's Ruhr district and attended conferences in Berlin, where he met his partner Klara Schabbel. In 1923 they took part in the fighting against the occupation of the Rhine and Ruhr area by French troops. From about 1930 both worked for the intelligence service of the Comintern, which later merged with the Red Army's GRU intelligence service, and the Young Communist International. Robinson became the section leader for Switzerland, France, and Great Britain. Schabbel maintained links to Berlin and, through the Soviet commercial agency there, communications to Moscow until June 1941. In December 1942 Robinson was arrested in Paris by the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle. According to British records, the RSHA had become aware of Robinson from information obtained from Leopold Trepper, whom they had previously arrested. After six months in Gestapo custody in France, where he was repeatedly tortured, Robinson was transferred to the Gestapo Detention Center in Moabit, Berlin, where he was murdered.

It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to thirty five small, dark red or brownish red flowers. Description Genoplesium psammophilum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between five and thirty five flowers are crowded along a flowering stem which is long, reaching to a height of . The flowers are dark red or brownish red and about wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is linear to egg- shaped, about long and wide and the lateral sepals are more or less lance- shaped, about long, wide and spread widely apart. There is a small, white gland on the tip of the lateral sepals. The petals are linear to egg-shaped, about long and wide with an s-shaped gland on the tip. The labellum is light to dark red, elliptic to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, about long and wide. There is a reddish to reddish black callus in the centre of the labellum and covering about half of its surface. Flowering occurs from March to May. Taxonomy and naming Genoplesium psammophilum was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Amity and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Corunastylis psammophila. The specific epithet (psammophila) is derived from the Ancient Greek words œàŒ¨ŒºŒºŒøœÇ (ps√°mmos), meaning ‚Äúsand‚Äù and œÜŒØŒªŒøœÇ (ph√≠los), meaning ‚Äúdear one\\" or \\"friend‚Äù, referring to the soil type in which this species is found. Distribution and habitat Genoplesium psammophilum grows in coastal and near-coastal heath and wallum in south-eastern Queensland.

Martin was declared elected to the Senate on a recount when Jacqui Lambie was caught up in the parliamentary eligibility crisis. He took his seat as an independent, before joining the National Party in May 2018 as its first Tasmanian member since the 1920s. He was previously the mayor of the City of Devonport from 2011 to 2018. Early life Martin was born in Devonport, Tasmania. Prior to entering politics he was a newsagent operator and restaurateur. Local government career In 2009, Martin was elected as an alderman to the Devonport City Council. He was also an unsuccessful candidate for Mersey in the Tasmanian Legislative Council elections. He was involved in the campaign to save the Mersey Community Hospital.Tasmanian Legislative Council 2009 Elections Mersey Martin began his mayoral term in 2011, survived a non-binding motion of no confidence in 2013, and was re-elected to a four-year term as Mayor in 2014. Senate Martin ran as a Senate candidate for the newly formed Jacqui Lambie Network (JLN) in the 2016 federal election, second on the JLN ticket behind party founder and incumbent Senator Jacqui Lambie. The party won enough votes for Lambie to be reelected. However, she resigned in November 2017 during the parliamentary eligibility crisis after discovering that she held dual British-Australian citizenship and was thus ineligible under section 44 of the Constitution of Australia. Due to Lambie being found ineligible by the High Court, the High Court ordered a countback be conducted to fill the seat. After JLN votes above the line flowed to Martin, he was declared elected. Kate McCulloch, an unsuccessful Tasmanian Senate candidate at the 2016 federal election for One Nation, argued that Martin was also constitutionally ineligible because his mayoral role amounted to an \\"office of profit under the Crown\\", but the High Court of Australia rejected this challenge and confirmed Martin's eligibility on 6 February 2018. Lambie expected Martin to immediately resign, which would have cleared the way for her to be appointed to fill the resulting casual vacancy and return to the Senate. She claimed that \\"personal morality\\" and loyalty dictated that Martin stand down. A party spokesman contended that Tasmanians intended for Lambie to hold the seat, and there was \\"an opportunity for that vote to be restored\\" if Martin resigned. When Martin refused to do so, Lambie expelled him later in the week. He resigned as Mayor of Devonport on 9 March 2018. =Joining the Nationals= Martin joined the Nationals on 28 May 2018. Martin became the first Tasmanian Nationals senator and the party's first Tasmanian member of parliament since Llewellyn Atkinson, who sat as a member of the then-Country Party in Wilmot (now Lyons) from 1921 to 1928 before returning to the Nationalists.http://theconversation.com/independent- crossbencher-steve-martin-joins-nationals-giving-the-party-a-tasmanian- presence-97320 Martin wants to reestablish a Nationals branch in Tasmania, where the party has historically not done well; it has only existed sporadically since Federation. He stood for re-election at the 2019 federal election, with The Sydney Morning Herald reporting that the Nationals are \\"throwing a modest level of resources behind his bid\\".

They are usually held to honor the traditional Victory Day holiday. In 2015, the Ukrainian government had renamed the holiday as \\"Victory Day over Nazism in World War II\\" as part of decommunization laws. However, even after the change, a vast amount of the populace still honors Ukrainian- Soviet troops who fought in World War II with traditional Victory Day parades. Victory Parades as a holiday tradition As Victory Day is the principal military holiday of Russia and of almost all member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (except the Baltics and Ukraine), the celebrations in Moscow and other capital cities thus serve as national events to mark such an important holiday for millions of people, marking the anniversary of the capitulation of Nazi Germany in 1945. The annual or semiannual parades mark the Allied victory in World War II on the Eastern Front, on the same day as the signing of the German act of capitulation to the victorious Allies in Berlin, at midnight of May 9, 1945 (Soviet time), officially concluding the Second World War in Europe and northern parts of Africa. A 1965 Victory Parade in Kishinev, the capital of the Moldovan SSR. During the entire history of the Soviet Union, only a total of four parades ever took place in Moscow and throughout the entire Soviet Union. In December 1947, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet under Josef Stalin, decreed that May 9th (Victory Day) would become a working day, effectively making the celebrations cancelled and ceased completely. However, on April 26, 1965, nearly twenty years after the first parade, under Leonid Brezhnev, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet reversed the actions made in 1947, thus making May 9 a non-working holiday, this would be the first time Victory Day was made as an actual holiday. On May 9, 1965 the second Victory Day parade took place in Moscow, this Victory Day celebration also saw veterans obtain the first jubilee medal for \\"Twenty Years of Victory\\" in honor of the 20th anniversary since the Allied victory in Europe against Nazi Germany.https://sputniknews.com/russia/201605091039305682-russia-vicrtory- celebration-parade/ Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20180317185211/https://sputniknews.com/russia/201605091039305682-russia- vicrtory-celebration-parade/ Further parades would be held in 1985 and 1990. Until 1989 celebrations of Victory Day were held in most Warsaw Pact countries (save for East Germany, whose celebrations fell on 8 May except in 1975, when it was marked on 9 May). Of all the countries that observed it, only Czechoslovakia held celebration parades every 5 years, also in honor of the successful Prague Uprising that ended on that day in 1945. In addition, Poland and Yugoslavia (which was outside the Iron Curtain) also held occasional parades, with the former staging a massive parade in 1985 to mark the ruby jubilee anniversary and the latter following the practice of Czechoslovakia of parades every 5th anniversary beginning with the 20th anniversary in 1965. In 2020, many of the traditional parades were cancelled, with the only ones being held in Belarus and Turkmenistan. The main parade in Russia, as well as parades in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan were cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. In response to these massive cancellations, World Health Organization regional director for Europe Hans Kluge referred to these cancellations as \\"a brave decision\\", highlighting their holiday significance. =Purpose= According to Russian anthropologist Sergey Ushakin, modern victory parades are intended to demonstrate the direct and immediate connection of the present with the past and to materialize the connection between generations.–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –£—à–∞–∫–∏–Ω. –í—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞—è –Ω–∞ –ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–µ: –æ–± –∞—Ñ—Ñ–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ–º –º–µ–Ω–µ–¥–∂–º–µ–Ω—Ç–µ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏. –ü–∞–º—è—Ç—å, –≤—ã–ø–∞–≤—à–∞—è –∏–∑ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏: —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–µ –æ—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ü–∏–∏ –ø–∞–º—è—Ç–∏ // –ì–µ—Ñ—Ç–µ—Ä.—Ä—É, 14.11.2014 General Oleg Salyukov, who has commanded the parade for close to a decade, described them in an interview with TASS as a \\"celebration for people, not show of militarism\\" referring to accusations of the parade being used as show of Russian military might. Parades in the Russian Federation Victory Day Parade in Moscow 2008 Today, Russia, as the largest of the countries of the former Soviet Union, continues the practice of parades held in honor of the victory won in the Great Patriotic War - the Eastern Front of the Second World War as called by the Soviet Union. The first of these parades was held in 1995 (5 years after the fall of the Soviet Union) under the auspices of President Boris Yeltsin, who held the parade to commemorate the golden jubilee of the Soviet and allied victory in the war. The parade was the only one to date that had to be divided into two parts (a full military parade on Poklonnaya Hill and a veterans ceremony on Red Square). = Red Square, Moscow = The 2018 Moscow Victory Day Parade The most important parade of those being held on May 9 is the one held on Moscow's Red Square, with the President of Russia as the guest of honor and keynote speaker in virtue of his constitutional mandate as Supreme Commander of the Russian Armed Forces. On the morning of the day, an estimated 14,000 military personnel, including a regiment of female cadets and youth cadets, assemble by battalions on the square together with the Massed Bands of around 1,100 bandsmen under the direction of the Senior Director of Music of the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of Russia (an appointment bestowed to either a colonel or a general rank officer), together with more than 210 vehicles and 3,800 vehicle crews assembled on Tverskaya Street just north of the Manezhnaya Square, Moscow, during the major parades a battalion or company of historical Red Army vehicles, estimated at around 36 vehicles and composed of just the T-34, GAZ-67 and the SU-100 plus the optional BM-13N (or at around an estimated 480 when counting other vehicles of the war which would take part just like in the parades of 1985 and 1990) assemble on the street as well with modern military hardware of the Armed Forces and the National Guard (and optionally by the other uniformed organizations). At the airbases outside Moscow (in areas like Kubinka), more than 88 aircraft are assembled with their aircrews for the flypast segment. Each of the contingents, since 1996, carry historical military colors of the 1942 (Red Army, Soviet Air Force, People's Militia) and 1932/1944 (Navy) patterns at the head of their formations honoring the millions of men and women who served in the ranks of the military and law enforcement services of the former Soviet Union during the long period of the Eastern Front of the Second World War, and the millions among them who were either killed or were missing in action. The celebrations begin at 9:55 am Moscow Standard Time with the arrival of the President and the Prime Minister of Russia to a special grandstand in front of Lenin's Mausoleum, where six of the past parades were reviewed by national leaders. They greet the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, service commanders, deputy ministers in the Ministry of Defence and commanders of the support units within the Armed Forces, together with veterans, veterans' families and representatives of the Suvorov and Nakhimov Schools assembled. To the left and right of the grandstand are the stands wherein veterans, veterans' families, and descendants and families of personnel killed in action are gathered. In between the grandstand to the south of the stands are two platoons of armed linemen and markers from the 154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment in the Imperial-styled military uniforms and some unarmed half-companies of the Kremlin Regiment, both of which would be later taking post to mark the distance of the troops marching past and to line the square's western side facing the Kremlin together with extra drum majors from the Band Service, which are there to coordinate the march past to be timed in with the music of the bands since the parade of 1995. At the square, the parade commander (usually a Colonel-General or rarely a General of the Army with the billet of Commander of the Ground Forces or as the Deputy Chief of General Staff) takes his place in a special an Aurus Senat armored limousine (formerly a Zil until 2018), having just received the report on the readiness of the parade from the commandant of the Combined Arms Academy who is a general officer. As the Spasskaya Tower of the Kremlin sounds the chimes at 10 am the parade commander orders the parade to present arms as the 154th PICR's 1st Honor Guard Company Colour Guard, to the melody of The Sacred War being played by the Massed Bands, marches into the square and past the dignitaries with guard carrying both the Flag of Russia and the Victory Banner. As the colour guards approach the grandstand, the colour officers execute eyes left and resume above face after passing by. This is followed by the parade being commanded to stand at ease after the colours take their place at the northwest end of the square fronting the State Historical Museum, besides the colour of the Armed Forces. Then the Minister of Defence (usually a billet of a General of the Army) is driven on the limousine to the center of the square nearest the tribune, the parade presenting arms again at this point. The parade commander informs him of the readiness of the parade to be inspected. The report is received, and to the tune of the Massed Bands, the Minister and the parade commander are driven to inspect the parading contingents each together with the bands. As the limousines stop the Minister sends Victory Day greetings to each of the parading contingents, in which they respond with a threefold loud Oorah that is heard all over the grounds. After the final greeting, the Massed Bands strike up to Slavsya from A Life for the Tsar as the PC returns to his place, the Minister driven to the grandstand amidst loud shouts of Oorah by the parade contingents where he dismounts the limousine and the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College, an affiliate of the Suvorov Military Schools, take their place behind the parade commander's car led by the Commandant of the College and the college colour guard. The parade is ordered to stand at ease after the Minister informs the President that the parade is formed up for the march past in review and its inspection officially completed. In 1965, 1985 and 1990 parades, the limousines would inspect the personnel of the mobile column at the Manezhnaya Square formed into battalions, in remembrance of the mounted inspection of the original 1945 parade, which included cavalry, tachankas and horse artillery in addition to the huge mobile column. Following the report of the Minister of Defence, the keynote holiday address to the nation of the President follows, preceded by a fanfare by the Massed Bands, usually Govovin's Moscow Fanfare. A moment of silence, since 2014, features as part of the keynote address. As the president finishes the address and a threefold Oorah resounds all over the square by the entire parade assembled and the honor guard presents arms, the Massed Bands play the National Anthem of Russia and a ceremonial battery armed with the 76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3) fire a 21-gun salute. As the anthem ends, the bands sound Retreat as the honor guard executes order arms and the parade commander orders the parade to commence the march past in the following manner: ::Parade... attention! Ceremonial march past! Form battalions! Distance by a single lineman! First battalion will remain in the right, remainder... left.. turn! Slope.. arms! As the command is given to start the linemen take their places and the field markers also as well at the south end of the square. As the PC ends the commands with Eyes to the right, forward, quick march! the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College, as is their tradition since 1938, march first to the tune of the \\"General Miloradovich\\" by one of its late alumni, Lieutenant General Valery Khalilov, one of the longest-serving Senior Directors of Music of the Military Band Service and conductor of the Moscow area massed bands from 2002 to 2016, being played by the drummers and fifers. As the massed bands start playing the Corps of Drums stop playing by the signal of the Corps Drum Major and swings its drumsticks while on the eyes right. The Corps is followed by the colour guard of the 154th PICR and its 1st Honor Guard Company, during jubilee parades, the colour guard is followed by a company of colour bearers carrying the front standards in the order of their marchpast in the 1945 Victory Parade and their escorts, colours from the regiments, brigades, and divisions which took part in the original 1945 parade and a historical unit of servicemen in period uniforms, optionally joined by the Kuban Cossacks, in memory of their contingent which marched past on that very parade, and the Escort Cavalry Squadron of the Kremlin Regiment plus a number of international contingents. This is followed by the rest of the parade ground column, starting with the youth contingents and by the Combined Arms Academy, among other troops. A schematic of the foreign troops in the 2020 Moscow Victory Day Parade. Once the ground column ends, the bands stop playing and, to give way to the mobile column by marching towards the facade of the GUM department store. The mobile column starts with the drive past of historical vehicles in jubilee years and only a T-34/85 medium battle tank carrying the Victory Banner non-special anniversary years. Following the end of the mobile column with the service flags of the three branches of the Armed Forces, the flypast then follows, usually as the Bands play the Aviamarch and other air marches. The flypast marks the formal end the parade. = Russian parades held outside Moscow = The massed bands of the St. Petersburg Garrison during the parade in 2016 A parade at the Khmeimim Air Base in 2018.

The parade commander gives the order to begin the review of the Minsk Garrison by the Defence Minister of Belarus, the parade presenting arms at that juncture and the massed bands of the Minsk Garrison under the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus beginning to play inspection music under the baton of the Senior Director of Music. Then as the limousines stop in front of the grandstand and the massed bands stop playing the Deputy Defense Minister of Belarus reports to the Defense Minister on the status of the parade. The Defense Minister, having now been duly notified, then reviews the parading troops along the avenue in his vehicle, stopping a few times to send holiday greetings to a 4,000 strong ground column formation from the armed forces and other uniformed organizations while the massed bands play inspection music. As the defense minister concludes the inspection of the troops, he reports to the president on the readiness of the parade. A minute of silence then takes place, followed by a performance of the National Anthem of Belarus (My Belarusy) by the massed bands. The president then delivers an address to the nation and congratulates the citizens on the holiday. As the president concludes the address, following a fanfare by the bands the parade commander then gives the order for the Minsk Garrison to get into their parade formations, and for the troops of the Honour Guard Company to take their post as linemen to mark the distance of the troops marching past the grandstand. The first unit to march, beating the snare drums, are the drummers of the Minsk Suvorov Military School, followed by cadets of special military high schools of the armed forces and public security organizations, and a colour guard consisting of the flag party (Flag of Belarus, Flag of the USSR, and Banner of Victory) the standards of the fronts which were involved in the 1944 Minsk Offensive, followed by historical companies, honoring both the regular Red Army and the Soviet Air Force that liberated the republic and the partisan movement that grew during the Nazi occupation. They consists of cadets of the Military Academy of Belarus dressed in military uniforms of the historical period of the war and equipped Mosin rifles. This is followed by the rest of the parade ground column in the following arrangement as they march past the presidential grandstand: * Military Academy of Belarus * Belarusian National Technical University * 120th Guards Separate Mechanized Brigade * 38th Guards Air Assault Brigade * 5th Special Operations Brigade * Battalion of women servicemen of the Armed Forces * Cadets of the Internal Troops College of the Military Academy of Belarus * Interior Ministry Troops * Special Purpose Police of Belarus * Company of women policemen of the Belarusian Police * State Border Committee Training Institute * Emergencies Ministry National University of Civil Defense * Territorial Defense of the Armed Forces * Honor Guard of the Armed Forces of Belarus The mobile column then follows, led up by a historical segment composed of military vehicles and equipment used during the days of the 1944 Minsk Offensive, followed on by the usual flypast by the Belarusian Air Force opened by a Mi-8 helicopter. The passage of the mechanized column is traditionally opened by equipment from the Great Patriotic War such as the T-34 and the SU-100. = Victory Park, Dushanbe = The parade in 2017. According to tradition, a wreath-laying ceremony at the tomb of the unknown soldier takes place at Victory Park. The ceremony is presided by the President of Tajikistan, and the parade commander is a deputy minister in the Ministry of Defense holding the rank of a lieutenant general. Full order of the parade: * Military Brass Band of the Commandant Regiment of the Ministry of Defense of Tajikistan * Presidential National Guard * Units of the Commandant Regiment of the Ministry of Defense * Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense of Tajikistan * Mastibek Tashmukhamedov Military Lyceum of the Ministry of Defense of Tajikistan * Russian 201st Military Base * Honor Guard Company of the Ministry of Defense of Tajikistan = Letn√° Plain, Prague = It was on the large expanse of Prague's Letn√° Plain (Letensk√° pl√°≈à), a large employ field that every 5 years on 9 May from 1951 to 1985 (formerly yearly until the 1960s) witnessed parades of the Czechoslovak People's Army in the federal capital of Czechoslovakia following a mix of the Soviet style and its own traditions in its grounds, celebrating both the victory in Europe and the conclusion of the successful Prague Uprising.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVjs1IkLhXU A televised event since the 1950s, the President of Czechoslovakia, in his capacity as General Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (unless held by a separate person) and Supreme Commander in Chief of the People's Army, was the chief guest of honor of the parade. On the morning of the day, an estimated 9,000 military personnel, assembled by battalions on the square together with the Prague Garrison Massed Bands of around 400-800 bandsmen under the direction of the Senior Director of Music (formerly stationed in different parts of the grounds in the 1950s) were present, with the stands in Milada Horakov√° street filled up with together with veterans, veterans' families and the general public.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnWBLhMVvDghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5NUmwX4Sk At the main grandstand attached to Letn√° Stadium were members of the Party Central Committee, the Cabinet, the Federal Assembly leadership and the chairmen of its two chambers, senior officers of the Ministry of National Defence and the General Staff, representatives of Soviet Armed Forces formations based in the republic and the diplomatic corps. The celebrations began at 10 am with the playing of the Presidential Fanfare, based on the Overture of the opera Libu≈°e, signalling the arrival of the president and if present, the Party General Secretary, with the Minister of National Defence, a billet of a General of the Army, informing the President of the presence of the parade. Later on, with the massed bands playing the Uvitaci Pochod by V√°clav Dobi√°≈°, the parade commander, a general officer with either Lieutenant General or Colonel General rank, with the parade now in the present arms position as ordered, after the bands stop playing, informed the Minister of National Defence on his parade car after that the parade has now been formed up for inspection. Following the report, the parade inspector then reviewed the mobile column first and then the assembled formations, including representatives of the People's Militias and the formations of the Ministry of the Interior, including the Border Guard and the National Security Corps, stopping at each unit to greet the assembled formations on the holiday. After all, have been inspected, the minister arrives back at the main grandstand to give the keynote address after the bands' trumpeters sound a bugle call. = Kazakh Eli Square, Astana = The traditional Victory Parade in the capital is held with the march on of the Flag of Kazakhstan and the Banner of Victory, before the President of Kazakhstan receives the report from the Defence Minister of Kazakhstan on the readiness of the parade. The minister and the president will then inspect the forces on parade, who will yell in a traditional greeting to their Supreme Commander-in-Chief. Once both officials arrive at the tribute, the present formally greets the troops before delivering a holiday address. Upon concluding the speech, the massed bands perform Meni≈ã Qazaqstanym before the parade commander (the Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Forces) sounds the orders to begin the parade. The parade is traditionally led by cadets of the Astana Zhas Ulan Republican School. They are then followed by contingents from the three services of the Armed Forces of Kazakhstan (Ground Forces, Air Defense Forces and the Naval Forces), the State Security Service, the National Guard, and the Territorial Troops, among other ground and air equipment.

It covers the necessary measures that can be taken by conservators, curators, collections managers, and other museum professionals to conserve the material unique to photographic plate processes. This practice includes understanding the composition and agents of deterioration of photographic plates, as well as the preventive conservation and interventive conservation measures that can be taken to increase their longevity. __TOC__ History=Composition= Photographic plates consist of an image bound to a glass support. Glass plates emerged as a common support medium for photographic negatives in the mid-nineteenth century. In general, black-and-white photographic negatives are made up of fine silver particles, (or color dyes for color negatives), which are embedded in a thin layer called a binder. Combined with the image substance, these two elements make-up what is called the emulsion. This emulsion layer sits upon what is called the support, which can be paper, metal, film, or as in the case of photographic plates, glass. An important part of the photographic process, \\"fixing,\\" is used to wash the silver particles that are not part of the image, which then produces a stable negative image. This negative image can then be used over many years to produce paper positives. Glass plates as a form of support were popular in use between 1851 and the 1920s. =Processes= Early wet plate collodion portrait of lady * Collodion glass plate negative: This process was invented by the Englishman Frederick Scott Archer in 1851. While the first process to take advantage of glass plates was an albumen, it was quite laborious and quickly surpassed by the collodion glass plate negative in common use. The collodion photographic process was a wet place process, which meant that the glass plate itself had to be wet while it was exposed and throughout processing. This required a portable darkroom to be taken wherever a photographer went in order to successfully produce a negative image. During the process, the collodion was the binder which was poured onto the glass plate before being exposed. The glass plate was then developed, fixed, washed, and protected with a varnish. * Gelatin dry plate negative: This process was invented by Richard Leach Maddox in 1871, but it was not commonly used until 1878 when the process became commercially successful. Because of the advances this process made in photography, it soon replaced the wet plate process in the 1880s. The collodion binder formerly used was replaced by gelatin which already contained the light-sensitive silver salts. This meant that the emulsion was already present and did not have to be painted on the glass plate right before exposure - which now only took less than one second. Because of this advancement, photographers did not have to carry their portable darkroom, but could develop later on. After 1878 when further improvements were made to the gelatin emulsion, gelatin glass plates began being mass-produced by companies such as Wratten & Wainright, Keystone Dry Plate Works, and notably the Eastman Dry Plate Company. This led to the advanced use and production of photographic glass plates until around 1925 and the development of the modern photography industry. Agents of deterioration Photographic plates face certain challenges to their preservation. In order to protect against deterioration or damage, conservators seek to identify the agents that threaten the various materials that make-up photographic glass plates. The primary agents of deterioration include the following: =Relative humidity & temperature= Relative humidity (RH) and temperature are two of the most serious threats to photographic plates and can determine their longevity. As with other cultural collections, an overall high temperature in combination with high humidity can lead to mold growth as well as attract pests. Heat is also a danger to collections because it is an element that accelerates any type of chemical deterioration that occurs, specifically in photographic materials. Photographic plates face significant structural and chemical challenges unique to their makeup - Fluctuations in RH can strain the adhesion of the gelatin to the glass plate as changes can cause the gelatin to expand and contract as well as cause emulsion to crack or separate along the edges. Also, on a gelatin dry plate, high humidity can cause mold to grow on the emulsion and cause the plates to stick together. Increasing the relative humidity can cause deterioration of other elements as well such as the silver, varnish, and glass support. Decreasing the RH will cause deterioration by leading to the flaking of the binder and dehydration of the glass. =Light= Photographic plates, along with all photographic materials, are very sensitive to light. Extensive and ongoing exposure to light can cause significant deterioration that is irreversible. Sunlight is the most damaging type of light, but indoor lighting and any other UV lighting all pose a serious threat to photographic plates causing fading and yellowing. Light is especially threatening to color photographic materials since it accelerates the fading of the color dyes. It was not uncommon for photographic plates to be hand-painted in order to produce color images. Exposure to light of colored glass slides could deteriorate and lead to discoloration of the pigments. =Air pollution= Air pollution can pose a threat to photographic plates through poor air quality and dirt that can damage the materials. This can include dust, gaseous pollution from an urban environment, and dirt particulate. Air pollution can cause fading of photographic materials as well as damage the surface of the image by causing an abrasion. Other sources of air pollution include \\"photocopying machines, construction materials, paint fumes, cardboard, carpets, and janitorial supplies,\\" as well as other types of outdated or obsolete media. =Material/chemical= The glass composition of photographic plates can be a factor of deterioration. Due to poor quality or an inherent vice, \\"sick glass\\" can occur. Environmental conditions are usually linked to the increase or presence of this glass corrosion. The effect of \\"sick glass\\" can be weeping and crizzling which can be caused by excessive alkali present and a lack of stabilizers. Weeping involves droplets forming on the glass that appear as small crystals. This type of deterioration is especially threatening for cased photographs because the cover glass could be corroded and damage the photographic image underneath. Corrosion of the glass plate support can also damage the image layer by causing the lifting of the binder and varnish layers. The other chemical components of glass plate negatives can also be threatening agents of deterioration. For instance, the silver image layer could possibly undergo oxidative deterioration which can lead to fading and discoloration. Additionally, the collodion binder itself is made up of cellulose nitrate which is known to be a flammable compound. While this is very dangerous as a film support, it is not thought to be as threatening in the binder. Most of these agents of deterioration are the result of poor chemical processing, but they are usually exacerbated by poor environmental and storage conditions. Broken glass plate - Avdella, izgorena, 1905 =Physical= Glass plates are rather stable dimensionally, but they are also very fragile and brittle. Because glass is brittle, it is highly susceptible to breakage, cracks, and fractures. This can be caused by human error including dropping or bumping the glass plate, or it can be caused by failure of storage equipment, housing, shelves, etc. which may lead to an impact to the glass. Types of breakage: * Impact break - point of impact and surrounding radiating arcs * Cracks - run perpendicular to applied stress * Blind cracks - breaks do not carry through the whole shard of glass Certain types of breakage and stress states affect the image layer and binder in different ways. Preventive conservation=Environment= Environmental controls are a crucial part of the preservation of photographic glass plates. Relative humidity (RH), temperature, and light play a large role in keeping the multiple materials in photographic glass plates maintained. The following regulatory measures are taken for their preservation: * For photographic glass plates, the temperature is kept cool at around 65 ¬∞F approximately. * RH levels are normally kept between 30-40%. If RH goes below 30%, the image binder of the glass plate will dehydrate. If RH goes above 40%, the glass will begin hydrating. For cased glass plate photographs, such as ambrotypes, RH levels are kept between 40-50% and temperature between 65-68 ¬∞F. These levels differ because of the case and its risk for embrittlement, brass mat, and glass deterioration. * Fluctuations, also called ‚Äúcycling,‚Äù in RH and temperature are sought to be avoided. Environmental fluctuations can contribute to mold growth, chemical deterioration including discoloration and yellowing, as well as deterioration of the emulsion. * Photographic glass plates, especially negatives, are preserved in dark enclosures due to their risk of deterioration when exposed to light, particularly UV and sunlight. If displayed, spot-lighting, which is uneven heating to the photographic plate, is avoided. Light levels are kept below 50 lux. =Handling= Photographic glass plates are handled carefully to avoid physical or chemical deterioration and damage ‚Äì the following aids in their preservation through proper handling: * To prevent fingerprints, non-vinyl plastic gloves are worn when handling ‚Äì either Latex or Nitrile. Cotton gloves are not recommended by conservators due to the possibility of glass easily slipping from the cotton material. * When handling, a glass plate is not held by one edge or corner, rather it is held by two opposite edges and always with two hands. * When laying the glass plate on a flat surface, it is always placed with the emulsion side up. * Glass plates are never stacked or have any pressure placed upon them. The sleeve or enclosure is labeled before placing the glass plate inside. * Since glass plates are fragile and brittle, duplicates are created if a glass plate is used often for printing. This helps to minimize the threat of breakage. =Storage= Storage and housing of photographic glass plates is an important part of their preservation. Museums and other cultural institutions take the following measures to ensure their glass plates are properly housed: * Photographic glass plates are housed in four-flap enclosures, emulsion side up. These four-flap buffered enclosures prevent a glass plate from being pulled in and out and further deteriorating the image through flaking and abrasions. Rather, the four-flap enclosure allows the glass plate to be accessed by unfolding the flaps without having to pull the plate across any surface or material. * The photographic glass plates are stored vertically on the long side of the plate in acid- and lignin-free storage boxes. The glass plates are not packed too tightly and are sought not to rub against each other. Each one is usually separated individually with stiffeners made of acid-free folder stock or acid-free cardboard in order to support the plates. * Photographic glass plates stored in a partially filled box will have spacers, most likely acid-free corrugated paperboard, inserted in order to prevent significant bumping or moving. * Glass plates that are larger than 10‚Äù x 12‚Äù are stored in legal size boxes that are partially filled to prevent a too heavy weight. The extra space in the box is filled with board or spacers to avoid shifting and jostling. * Storage boxes consisting of photographic glass plates are stored on a lower shelf, specifically below four feet. This helps to prevent someone from lifting them down from above his or her head. * Each storage box of photographic glass plates is labeled with words such as ‚ÄúHeavy,‚Äù ‚ÄúHandle with Care,‚Äù ‚ÄúCaution: Contains Glass Negatives,‚Äù so that everyone knows to be extra careful when lifting the box off a shelf. Storage of broken photographic plates Broken or cracked glass plates are stored in a special manner, separate from other photographic plates and in the following ways: * Broken glass plates are not stacked but stored flat. * Photographic glass plates that are cracked or have binder damage are stored on sink-mats. Those with minor flaking are still housed in the four-flap enclosure that is labeled appropriately describing the damage. Glass plates with extensive flaking are stored on sink-mats horizontally and placed in a storage box with a label that reads ‚ÄúCaution: Broken glass. Carry Horizontally.‚Äù * Broken glass plate shards are often ‚Äúsandwiched‚Äù in between two pieces of buffered board and then placed inside the four-flap enclosure. * AIC advises that form-fit support should be created for broken glass shards by cutting out two pieces of 4-ply mat board that fit to each shard. Then, these pieces are glued to each side of the buffered board with either wheat starch paste or 3M #415 double-stick tape. By placing each shard in between the form- fit support, this will help to prevent further damage. These broken shards are then placed in individual four-flap enclosures and stored flat with appropriate labeling that warns of their broken condition. * Another method of storing broken shards is to place them on sink-mats. If this method is used, each piece is separated with paperboard spacers to prevent the pieces from touching. These paperboard spacers are sometimes attached with adhesives to the mat so that physical damage does not occur to the shards. They are stored horizontally and placed in a storage box with a label that reads ‚ÄúCaution: Broken glass. Carry Horizontally.‚Äù =Maintenance/housekeeping= Maintenance/housekeeping of photographic plates requires minimal intervention: * For their preservation, light cleaning is carried out occasionally by removing dust with a soft brush. * Conservators also keep the surrounding collections area clean of dust, pests, and any other debris that may attract pests. Also, food and drink is not permitted in the storage area. To prevent deterioration from air pollutants, it is helpful for conservators to have the air entering the storage area filtered and purified, windows closed, obsolete/outdated media minimized, and enclosures and cabinets used to protect collection objects. Conservation treatment Broken or cracked glass plates make up a large portion of those in need of conservation treatment. There are various actions taken in reassembling and restoring these plates using the following materials and methods: Adhesives: (There is no one ideal adhesive to be used) * Paraloid B-72 - A solution of 50-70% B-72 in a solvent with added silica is used to reassemble glass plate fragments. It takes 1‚Äì2 hours to dry. One issue with this adhesive is that it creates \\"snowflakes\\" in between the pieces making an invisible reassembly impossible. * Epoxy resin - This adhesive is thought to be very strong and has low shrinkage. An issue with this method is that it yellows over time and is not advisable to be used on glass plates with a collodion binder. This is due to the potential damage to the collodion binder of the reversibility method. * Cyanoacrylates - This adhesive bonds strongly with alkaline surfaces but is very brittle and only used for temporary repairs. Application: * Wicking - This is used by conservators to apply the adhesive to the glass with a wooden or glass applicator. A capillary tube or bottle is used to put the appropriate amount of adhesive on the glass shard without excess. Backing material: * Silpat‚Ñ¢ sheet - This is made of silicone and fibreglass; textured and provides air pockets to prevent damage from capillary application; it does not create trauma for the emulsion side of the glass. * Secondary support is used for glass plates broken into many pieces or over 5 x 7 inches in size - A second piece of glass is used with silicone as a material to be inserted as a barrier layer. Repair methods & techniques: * PhotoShop Software assembly - Virtually assembling broken glass shards through Photoshop by scanning or photographing all pieces is used by conservators. This helps to avoid further damage and deterioration of the glass plate photograph. * Inclined assembly - This method involves applying an adhesive to the glass shard interfaces and assembling them on an inclined surface covered with Mylar or Silpat‚Ñ¢. The glass shards are reassembled either by direct application, which involves applying the adhesive directly to the shard interface and attaching it to its corresponding piece; or they are assembled through wicking where the adhesive is applied to the shard interface through capillary action. * Vertical assembly - This method is used because of the manner in which the glass shards fit back together, which is the most accurate vertically. This also helps to protect the side of the binder layer. When assembling the pieces vertically, pressure sensitive plastic tape or sticky wax is used to hold the pieces together. The adhesive is not applied until all of the pieces are assembled - this helps to recognize any misalignment before they are adhered together. As the last step, the adhesive is applied through wicking. * Light-line - This is often used to insure all of the pieces are aligned. A light-line creates a straight line of light that allows a conservator to see any misalignment by producing a crooked line. Once the pieces are aligned, the light-line will be straight again. The Glass Plate Negative Project at the Heritage Conservation Centre * The vertical assembly method along with a light-line is used in The Glass Plate Negative Project at the Heritage Conservation Centre as outlined in the case study. This study shows how conservators deal with other conservation issues as well including accretions and residue. * For instance, while the plates were considered structurally stable, they may have needed surface cleaning.

The building is constructed with yellow brick and indigenous limestone, of a much lighter design than is typical for the style. The building has a hipped roof with a gable centered in front. The center of the primary facade is stepped forward, with a broad, rough limestone arch that rises over the front door. James L. Nichols, a professor at North-Western College (now North Central College) and successful author and publisher, established the library with a $10,000 bequest. In 1962, the City of Naperville built an addition, of a modern design, connecting to the south wall of the original building. In 1996, the City sold the building to a local church. A developer bought the building from the church in 2017.

This variation is not to be confused with the Primitive Wrong Diagonal Bishop opening, which is characterized by dropping the bishop to 45 (or 65 for White) even earlier. Development The Wrong Diagonal Bishop variation of the Bishop Exchange opening was most popular during the 1950s and was often played by Yasuharu ≈åyama and Masao Tsukada. =Classic Bishop Exchange= The Classic Bishop Exchange has Black's rook pawn advanced all the way to the middle rank 5 and White has defended the second file with a gold development. White initiates the standard bishop trade, and then, after Black captures the promoted bishop and White moves their silver up to defend the second file is when the Wrong Diagonal Bishop variation starts. Black drops the bishop forking White's two pawns. Thus, the initial moves of the variation are actually the same as the other Bishop Exchange variations up until the moment of the player's bishop drop on the wrong diagonal. White defends the sixth and fifth file pawns. Black captures White's third file pawn. Since White's right gold has already by developed so that it protects the fourth and second file pawns, White can use their silver now to attack Black's bishop and push it back to the central file. At this point, Black has two options of either left side bishop development or right side bishop development.

Many enzymes effect the hydroxylation of hydrocarbons as a means for biosynthesis, detoxification, gene regulation, and other functions. These enzymes often utilize Fe-O centers that convert C-H bonds into C-OH groups. The oxygen rebound mechanism starts with abstraction of H from the hydrocarbon, giving an organic radical and an iron hydroxide. In the rebound step, the organic radical attacks the Fe-OH center to give an alcohol group, which is bound to Fe as a ligand. Dissociation of the alcohol from the metal allows the cycle to start anew. This mechanistic scenario is an alternative to the direct insertion of an O center into a C-H bond. The pathway is an example of C-H activation.Oxygenation reactions by high-valent iron-oxo species are \\"C‚ÄìH activation\\" reactions in the broad sense of the term. Some authors would call this a C‚ÄìH functionalization but not an \\"activation\\" (in its narrow sense), since a metal‚Äìcarbon bond is not involved in the C‚ÄìH bond cleaving process. Steps in an oxygen rebound mechanism: H-atom abstraction, oxygen rebound, alcohol decomplexation. The formal charge on the porphyrin changes from 1- to the more usual 2-. Three main classes of these enzymes are cytochrome P450, alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases, and nonheme-diiron hydroxylases.

The thirty- five-year-old Rev. MacNicol wrote the poem in lament of being snubbed by Lillias Campbell, a local laird's daughter. He had requested the seventeen- year-old girl's hand in marriage, but Lillias had already accepted the hand of her cousin, Captain Alexander Campbell. However, Sir Alexander made an ungallant bet with a servant which left the angered Lillias no choice but to accept the alternate proposal of the Rev. MacNicol. They married just after her eighteenth birthday, and would go on to have sixteen children. The poem was later set to music and remains a popular Highland folk song.

Background On 10 February, 9th Division commander Major General George G. O'Connor gave the commander of the 1st Brigade, 9th Division, Colonel Harry O. Williams, control of the 2nd Battalion, 39th Infantry Regiment, 5th Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment, 1st Battalion, 84th Artillery Regiment and Company A, 15th Engineer Battalion to conduct Operation Hop Tac I to secure and repair Route 4 across the length of Dinh Tuong Province. Operation The operation proceeded uneventfully for the first week. On the evening of 14 February, three Vietcong (VC) battalions attacked Vƒ©nh Long and the 1st Brigade was put on alert to assist, however the South Vietnamese forces were able to force the VC out without U.S. assistance. =Firebase Jaeger= Battle of Firebase Jaeger, 25 February 1968 The 1st Brigade had established Firebase Jaeger () to support the operation approximately 7km northeast of ƒê·ªìng T√¢m Base Camp. Jaegar was built on dry rice paddy criss-crossed by shallow dikes giving clear observation of the surrounding area. Four 155 mm howitzers of Battery B, 1/84th Artillery were located at Jaegar, together with Companies B and C, 5/60th Infantry, equipped with 25 M113 armored personnel carriers, a 30-man road-building team from Company B, 15th Engineers and a platoon from Company A, 2/39th Infantry. Half of the M113s were spaced at 25-meter intervals around the base perimeter, while the rest were concentrated at the center. Given the hard dried out ground, none of the M113s were dug in and the base was only lightly fortified. In the early hours of 25 February when 3-400 VC 263rd Main Force Battalion and the 313th Sapper Engineer Company approached Jaeger from the south, east, and west. At 01:45 an observation post on the southeast of the base saw VC through a Starlight scope and raised the alarm. Four M113s were sent to investigate the contact and had only just exited the north of the base when they were hit by Rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) setting the lead M113 on fire. Seconds later, more RPGs were fired at the M113s on the western perimeter setting a further 5 ablaze. VC sappers then attacked the perimeter wire with satchel charges. Col. Williams called for reinforcements from Firebase Hessian, 3km to the east and Firebase Fels, 3km to the west. At 02:45 a VC squad penetrated the artillery battery capturing 2 of the howitzers. The commander of Company C then called for artillery support from Firebases Hessian and Fels as airbursts directly over Jaeger. The defenders took cover as the artillery barrage temporarily disrupted the VC attack. A relief force of 7 M113s had left Firebase Hessian and despite losing 2 M113s to RPGs en route, 5 arrived at Jaeger at 03:00 and began attacking the VC around the perimeter. By 03:15 the VC began retreating. At 03:30 M113s carrying Company A, 2/39th Infantry arrived from Firebase Fels and pursued the VC to the south. At 04:15 Company C 2/39th Infantry, walked in from Firebase Fels and by 05:15 the area had been secured and the engagement was over. 22 Americans had been killed, 9 M113s had been destroyed and two howitzers had been damaged. The VC had lost approximately 100 killed. Aftermath VC activity in Dinh Tuong Province dropped off noticeably after the battle at Firebase Jaeger. U.S. night ambushes of VC mine-laying teams on Route 4 reduced mine attacks to negligible levels. The operation concluded on 10 March 1968.

It was created by the California State Water Resources Control Board as an improvement from groundwater programs that were already in place. GAMA monitors various aspects in groundwater such as the water quality and allotment total through research projects conducted by multiple agencies both statewide and locally sourced. GAMA wants to improve public awareness for groundwater resources as well as improve monitoring on groundwater research across the state to assess potential hazards from this resource.  California groundwater  Approximately 85% of water used in California by farmers and residents today is from groundwater, with 6 million Californians relying solely on this resource. The Central Valley is a big user of groundwater for agricultural purposes which supplies a large portion of food for not only California, but for the rest of the United States as well. This resource for a long time had been unregulated which helps us understand the groundwater crisis that occurs today in California. This was a highly relied upon resource over the past century, and was especially critical during drought periods. When there was less snow pack and less precipitation, people relied heavily on groundwater. Over time, issues have arose like land subsidence which occurs from pumping groundwater out faster than it can naturally replenish underground. This is one reason among many others for why GAMA was proposed.  Research projects  Unconfined aquifer referring to a shallow aquifer. Confined aquifer referring to a deep aquifer.Since GAMA has been implemented, there have been a few projects that GAMA aims to achieve to better understand California's groundwater systems. = Priority Basin Project = Begun in 2002 to help better understand risks imposed on California groundwater, this project looks at both deep and shallow aquifers. Deep groundwater for this project looks at how this water is used for the public use. Shallow aquifers address more local water uses such as wells. By tracking both of these aquifers, officials hope to be able to better understand impacts on groundwater, to provide more information to consumers. = GeoTracker GAMA = This is a system that integrates reported data from all of Californias groundwater systems from both the Priority Basin Project and the Domestic Well Project. This information goes through analytical processes to later be uploaded onto a comprehensive statewide map. This monitoring method allows all agencies access to a comprehensive site where data is available for users to see if there is a potential contaminant that is above safety levels. = Domestic Well Project = This project took samples from domestic wells and analyzed the water quality for commonly occurring chemicals. This gave well owners information regarding the quality of their water, which also acted as a baseline for other wells in the area. This information was entered into the GeoTracker GAMA project data. There has been a main focus on six counties which include Tehama, Monterey, Yuba, El Dorado, Tulare, and San Diego counties. Over one thousand wells collectively between all counties have been sampled so far. Chemicals tested include Nitrates, Perchlorate, Sulfate, Chloride, Coliform, Volatile Organic Compounds, Aluminum, Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, Iron, Lead, Manganese, Thallium, Vanadium, Zinc, Radium, and Uranium. Most owners received information by pamphlets sent by mail regarding the water quality of their well. = The Arrowhead Tunnels Project = The Arrowhead Tunnels Project shares a portion and is regulated under the Metropolitan Water District (MWD). MWD was issued a Special Use Permit to the San Bernardino National Forest. The Special Uses Permit allows other multi- disciplinary services and agencies to evaluate techniques of construction, hydrology, groundwater dependent systems, impacts on groundwater storage, and how groundwater is recovered. A case study done by The San Bernardino National Forest developed a goal for a groundwater management project called the Arrowhead Tunnels project, in hopes to maintain the current health and vitality of the ecosystem. The project's protocol is to monitor and protect the amount of groundwater activity. The design includes two 16-ft tunnels that stretch over 8 miles and about 2,040 ft deep. The success of the project has been effective in terms of measuring base flow, ground water-dependent surface water, and the hydrological processes of the San Bernardino Mountain water table. The main sources of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) described in 2005 from the EPA.  Assessments and Findings  In 2003 the Department of Water Resources developed an analysis on 39 well water resources to trace toxic chemicals and pollutants. The collection of samples were monitored from local and regional areas of the Sacramento Valley including the Sacramento Basin and Volcanic Provinces such as Sierra Nevada and Chico, CA. The Volcanic Provinces contain the Vina and West Butte Basins which are interconnected with the large Sacramento Basin. In 2003, the California Aquifer Susceptibility (CAS) project managed sources of contamination and assessed water quality for toxic traces of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). Volatile Organic Compounds form from human activity and naturally. The process includes an organic compound that undergoes evaporation and the remaining molecules are released into the water or the atmosphere from temperature changes. The assessment is used as a source towards prevention of current water supply to become contaminated. Diagram of the Water Cycle and the anthropogenic influences impacting water recharge systems. = Pharmaceutical Pollutants = The years of 2004- 2005 Los Angeles Metropolitan area and neighboring basins in Southern and Central California have completed GAMA assessments on water quality which assesses for public drinking-water supply and overall quality of groundwater tables. The flow rates in groundwater supply are deprived by surface, recharge systems from storms, waste and sewage water treatment systems. The assessment discovered traces of pharmaceuticals of human and non-human material being disposed in the groundwater recharge supply. Pharmaceutical toxic chemicals reported were pesticides, insecticides, caffeine, and various other toxic chemicals. There is a connection that the repeated concentration rates in pharmaceuticals found in the water supply was anthropogenic. There was limited use on land-owned wells because of the potential risk of the recharge water supply which could have been affected by the pharmaceutical traces. The pesticides and insecticide chemicals are driven by human activity, including agricultural practices and irrigation runoff. The pesticides and insecticide chemicals are said to be driven by human activity, including agricultural practices and irrigation runoff. There is a large indication that there will be a large risk in Los Angeles groundwater supply in the future. Los Angeles is the largest urbanized region in California and increased potential risk factors from pharmaceutical and toxic concentrations on drinking water supply are arising for the City of Los Angeles. The GAMA assessment collects data that is useful for monitoring and protecting future groundwater and drinking water supply. The GAMA Program is useful for tracing toxic pollutants and chemicals that can have harmful effects on human health.  Legislation  GAMA was built on current legislation which consists of six bills and one proposition. = The 1999 Budget Act = The 1999 Budget Act was the development plan and framework which instructed the members of the California State Water Resources Control Board to begin establishing the Groundwater Ambient Monitoring and Assessment Program (GAMA Program). The purpose of the GAMA program is to demonstrate and measure environmental vulnerability and particle concentrations of pollutants in groundwater tables. Various GAMA Assessment reports in Northern California include the state capital of Sacramento on the basis of public safety and water quality. The reports have made contributions from a document called the Supplemental Report of the 1999 Budget Act. = AB 599: Groundwater Quality Monitoring Act = Took affect in 2001 shortly after GAMA was implemented. Legislature stated that it's a necessity that groundwater should continue to be monitored to make sure the groundwater system is safe. More information to the public needs to be improved upon, and more information needs to be conducted to better understand how to restore depleted groundwater systems. A comprehensive program among agencies would need to be implemented across the state to ensure adequate monitoring measures. California State Capitol. California citizens vote prop 50 (water scarcity, Clean Drinking Water, Coastal and Beach Protection Act) = Prop 50: Water Scarcity, Clean Drinking Water, Coastal and Beach Protection Act = Passed in November 2002. This Act was granted approximately $380 million for IRWM plans and projects. Voters approved this act which would help with a number of issues such as groundwater replenishment plans, improved water quality, and improved water security. = AB1747: Bond Law for Proposition 50 Projects = States that rules from Proposition 50 must be in line with AB 599. = AB 2222: Groundwater Information Accessibility and Identification of Communities Reliant on Contaminated Groundwater = This bill states that the state board extend AB 599 funding to 2024. Public opinion would be able to make recommendations and state opinions before new legislation would be enacted. Public accessibility would be improved upon as well regarding issues such as contaminated groundwater, and developing plans to assess the situation. = SB X2 1: Nitrate Pilot Projects in Tulare Lake and Salinas Basins = Implemented in 2008 as a recovery program to understand why contamination can occur in groundwater and preventative measures. Tulare lake and Salinas basin will serve as a research zones. Agencies will find point sources of nitrates in groundwater, and reduce nitrate levels or prevent them entirely. Costs and funding methods must be interpreted for these zones. Adding an interagency task force to monitor and expand cleanup programs will be a necessity, and reports must be generated including all research conducted from Tulare Lake and the Salinas Basin. = SB1938: Monitoring Components for Groundwater Managing Plans = A local agency can come up with a new plan for groundwater management based on prior groundwater laws. SB 1938 declared that groundwater must be protected and adequately managed, especially during dry years where groundwater use increases. This bill continues to declare that groundwater systems are not well understood which complicates future planning, and that agencies need to communicate with each other to effectively manage a monitoring system for this resource. = SB 4: Oil and Gas: Well Stimulation = Implemented in 2013. Well Stimulation Treatments would need an all- inclusive program to monitor these actions. Part of this bill enacted research on well stimulation treatments which owners or well operators would be required to have recorded data on these sites. Permits would be required to perform any well stimulation treatments as well as frequent inspections. Fines will be issued if violations occur. This program must be implemented starting in July, 2015.

Suman is worried for her daughter because she knows Thakur will go to extreme lengths to get Amoli. For her daughter's safety, Suman tells Amoli to go to Meerut to see a family that will help her. Amoli is confused but goes to Meerut to run from Thakur. Upon reaching Meerut, Amoli enters the mansion of the very rich family, the Pundits. The family consists of Devi Pundir, his wife Sunanda, his two daughters, Sanchita and Ankita, two nephews, Deepak and Prithvi, their two wives, Badiya and Chiggy bahu, and his sister and brother-in-law. Amoli meets Sunanda Devi first and Sunanda mistakes her for a servant. Amoli agrees to live in the Pundir mansion as a maid, where she forms a friendship with Ankita. Meanwhile, Thakur searches for Amoli everywhere and will not rest until he finds her. Suman visits the Pundir mansion to warn Amoli that Thakur is searching every city, but she is shocked to see Amoli working as a maid since that is not the purpose of Amoli's trip. She confronts Sunanda about Amoli. Sunanda is shocked to see Suman as they have some hidden past. Suman reveals to Sunanda that Amoli is not her daughter but Sunanda's. It is revealed that 20 years ago, Sunanda gave birth to Amoli and Suman met her and helped her as Sunanda was in pain. As soon as Amoli was born, Sunanda's mother told Suman that she wanted an heir, not a granddaughter, and to keep Amoli; Sunanda was told that her baby died. In the present, Sunanda has a breakdown from learning that her eldest daughter has been alive all these years, and is now working as her maid. Suman tells Sunanda to tell her husband that Amoli is his daughter but Sunanda decides not to as it will ruin the family. After this, Sunanda treats Amoli as her daughter which surprises Badiya bahu, who dislikes Amoli. Amoli soon finds out that Sunanda is her biological mother. She disapproves at first but later comes around. Badiya bahu and her father in law find out and plot to reveal this secret to the whole family. They decide to do so on Devi and Sunanda's marriage anniversary. Badiya bahu calls Suman back and Suman is shocked to see that Sunanda still has not told the family members about Amoli's real identity. She lashes out at Sunanda as why she is treating her daughter like this. She reveals to the whole family that this is Amoli's real family. The family members are stunned especially Devi, Sanchita and Ankita. Devi is angry at Sunanda and threatens their marriage. Sunanda runs away after this and gets into an accident. The family visits her in the hospital and there Devi accepts Amoli as his daughter and Sanchita and Ankita accept her as their sister. A few days later, Sunanda returns to the mansion with Devi and she is happy to see Amoli bonding with the family. However, on the other hand, a man named Ranveer enters the Pundir mansion. He looks exactly like Thakur. Amoli accuses him of being Thakur but Ranveer says he is Ranveer, not Thakur. Ranveer is Devi's business partner, who is staying at the mansion for a few days. After a while, Amoli and Ranveer become friends as she now believes him to be Ranveer. However, Ranveer is, in fact, Thakur; he created a fake identity as Ranveer in order to get Amoli back. The family chooses a boy for Ankita and begin her marriage preparations. But the aunt of Ankita's would-be in-laws tells the family that although Amoli is the eldest she should get married first. She sees Ranveer and Amoli's photograph and believes them to be in love. Amoli agrees to marry him for her family's happiness. After the marriage, Amoli finds out that he is Thakur and runs away, then decides to stay to get revenge. Soon, she sends him to jail twice although he is innocent, Thakur gets out. Thakur's nephew, Puneet poisons Amoli's drink. Thakur sees the poison in Amoli's drink and drinks it himself. After this incident, Amoli feels a change about Thakur. She sees that he would die for her. After some more events, Amoli still attempts revenge but fails each time. Amoli runs over a woman and Thakur takes the blame. These incidents bring them closer. During this time, Amoli falls in love with Thakur. Amoli's love changes Thakur and he starts doing things that Amoli likes. After another incident, Puneet orders Amoli to be stoned to death, but he is stoned instead. Later, a man revealed to be Radhe, is shown burning the photo of Thakur and Amoli. Radhe has returned to get revenge on both Thakur and Amoli. Amoli is extremely happy to find out that he is alive. Radhe pretends he still loves her but he is actually in love with sandhya. Both of them plot to steal the property. Thakur finds out and tells Amoli but she accuses him. However, she finds out herself and feels betrayed. Amoli and Thakur are kidnapped by Puneet and Radhe. While Thakur fights back Puneet tries to kill him. To save Thakur Amoli shoots Puneet. Puneet dies and Thakur takes the blame on him. Amoli cries when seeing Thakur arrested by police. Thakur promises Amoli that he will surely return to her. He is sentenced to five-year imprisonment. After imprisonment Thakur returns home. Villagers give a great welcome to their Thakur. Thakur and Amoli finally consummate their marriage and start a happy life, dealing with village problems together. The serial ends on a good note.

History  The windmill in 1900 The tower was originally built in 1740 to replace the Bruy√®res windmill, which had been built in 1525 but had become obsolete. It was rented for the first time by Messire Hocquart to Jacques Boyartaux on May 6, 1742. The windmill, reconstructed in 1818, fell into disrepair in the nineteenth century after it became redundant with competition from another mill. It was restored in 1896 when it was known as Moulin de la Galette and became a Sunday attraction. In the twentieth century, the windmill again began to deteriorate. In 1972, an organization was created to protect the windmill. This group attempted to restore the building from 1978 to 1982, but the ground was riddled with old gypsum quarries which caused the windmill to collapse. Due to these unstable conditions, it was decided to rebuild the windmill away. Work began on restoring the windmill at its new location in 1986, and the new windmill was inaugurated on October 9, 1988.

He is director of Paektu Cultural Exchange, an organization that promotes investment and tourism in North Korea. In December 2018, while he was living and working in Dandong on the Chinese side of the China‚ÄìNorth Korea border, Spavor was taken into custody by Chinese officials. His arrest is widely interpreted as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. History Michael Spavor was born in Calgary, Alberta. He has a degree from the University of Calgary in international relations, focusing on the Korean Peninsula and East Asian Studies, and has studied International Trade and Political Science at Kangwon National University in South Korea. Spavor is fluent in Korean, including the North Korean dialect, and French. Spavor's ties with North Korea go back to at least 2001, when he first visited the country. In 2005, he became the managing director of a Vancouver-based NGO and spent six months working as a teacher at an affiliated school in Pyongyang. In the same year, he met American defector James Joseph Dresnok in Pyongyang. Spavor is friends with Kenji Fujimoto, Kim Jong-il's Japanese former sushi chef, whom he first met in Japan in early 2016 and again in April 2016. In South Korea, Spavor attended Kangwon National University and worked for the Korea Tourism Organization and Seoul Tourism Organization. He also was a council member of the Royal Asiatic Society Korea Branch from 2010 to 2013, giving lectures and leading cultural excursions. He gained attention for restoring and living in a hanok in Bugahyeon-dong in western Seoul, and appeared in a music video for the K-pop group SES. From 2010 to 2013 Spavor worked for the Pyongyang Project, a Canadian non-profit that organized educational exchanges in North Koreans and provided scholarships for North Korean students overseas, and in 2015 he founded Paektu Cultural Exchange. Spavor has strong personal ties with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. In September 2013, Spavor facilitated the second visit of Dennis Rodman to North Korea and became one of the few Westerners to have met Kim while in the city of Wonsan. Spavor later organized Rodman's 2014 visit. Spavor has been involved in the financial development of Wonsan, which is a high priority for Kim Jong-un, who has invested at least $150 million into the city. = Paektu Cultural Exchange = In January 2016, Spavor and Paektu Cultural Exchange sought a European Order for Payment against the betting company Paddy Power for failing to fulfill their contractual obligations after they pulled sponsorship for a basketball event to be held in North Korea. In March 2016 Spavor organized the Pyongyang International Friendship Ice Hockey Exhibition (PIFIHE), bringing around 20 foreign hockey players to North Korea, including two Canadian residents of South Korea, for a series of games and other workshop events. In 2017, during a qualifying match between the North and South Korean women's ice hockey teams for the 2018 Winter Olympics, Spavor was assaulted by South Korean security officials as he tried to display the North Korean flag.At the Olympics, It‚Äôs Not Just North Koreans Rooting for North Korea Outside of sports exchanges, Spavor also played a role in the restoration of the Ryongwang Pavilion in Pyongyang, spending four years on the project alongside the Prince Claus Fund and North Korea's National Administration for the Protection of Cultural Heritage. Spavor is often consulted by analysts and journalists for insights into North Korea. He has, however, been reluctant to comment on politics and human rights in North Korea. = Detention in China = In December 2018, China detained Spavor and Michael Kovrig, another Canadian national, on charges of endangering state security. The arrests came shortly after Canada had arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, in what is becoming an escalating diplomatic row between the two countries. Spavor and Kovrig are reported to be held in isolation without being allowed outdoors, kept under lighting and surveillance 24 hours a day, with 6 to 8 hours of interrogations per day. China has allowed three consular visits as of February 1, 2019. During Spavor's detention, his friends noticed suspicious activity on his social media accounts, leading them to believe Chinese interrogators were accessing his accounts. In mid-December 2018 a GoFundMe campaign was started to raise funds for Spavor to help with any legal and travel costs following his release, but after it reached $10,000 Canadian three weeks later on 7 January 2019 the crowdfunding platform terminated the campaign without notice or explanation. The campaign was reinstated later. Andrei Lankov, an expert on North Korea, expressed surprise over Spavor's arrest in this \\"hostage game\\", saying that Spavor \\"is from very humble origins [and] definitely not the son of a CEO of a major Canadian company\\".

It was published by Macmillan Publishers' Flatiron Books on April 17, 2018. Background After James Comey was fired as Director of the FBI by Donald Trump, he began to write an autobiography. Several publishers submitted bids in an auction conducted by literary agency Javelin to secure the rights to the book. By August 2017, Macmillan Publishers' Flatiron Books announced that it had acquired the rights to Comey's autobiography, and set a release for spring 2018. The announcement stated the book would be discussing ethics, leadership, and Comey's experience in government. In November 2017, the title of the book was revealed to be A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership with a release date of May 1, 2018. The title references how Trump insisted on Comey's personal \\"loyalty\\" regarding the criminal investigation into Michael Flynn in a private meeting in January 2017, and how Comey relies more on a \\"higher loyalty\\" to lasting values such as justice and truth. The release date was moved up to April 17 because of scrutiny faced by the FBI during the Special Counsel investigation. On March 19, A Higher Loyalty had become the top-selling book on Amazon. It was overtaken the next day by A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo, then returned to the top-selling rank on Amazon shortly before the release date, after receiving significant media coverage. Release A week after the book's initial release, sales topped 600,000 copies when including print, audiobooks, and e-books.  Reaction  In early April 2018, before the release of A Higher Loyalty, the Republican National Committee (RNC) launched a website in an attempt to discredit Comey. The RNC also released two digital attack ads painting Comey as \\"not credible\\", a \\"leaker\\", and a \\"Washington insider\\". In an interview that aired on April 13, 2018, RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel described A Higher Loyalty as \\"salacious\\" and said that \\"when you read it, [Comey] discredits himself\\". McDaniel, who said that she had not read the book, stated that her opinion was based on \\"excerpts\\" she had heard. The Independent, giving the book three stars out of five, described it as \\"peppered with brutal asides about Trump, but his version of events rings true.\\" The New York Times called it \\"very persuasive\\" and described the book as \\"absorbing\\" in its book review, stating \\"Comey's memoir offers visceral details on a president untethered to truth.\\" The Guardian observed \\"While spilling the beans on Trump, the ex-FBI director portrays himself as both high-minded and willing to share his own pratfalls.\\" The Evening Standard headlined the book as \\"The G-man gets his revenge on Trump\\", and Philip Delves Broughton stated \\"Trump offends all that Comey claims to hold dear about power in America and the values and institutions which merit his loyalty.\\" The San Francisco Chronicle summarised the book as \\"Former FBI Director James Comey knows he may never be forgiven by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump for what he did ‚Äì and did not do ‚Äì in the 2016 presidential election. His much-anticipated new book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" is his appeal for them and their supporters to at least understand, if not accept, the reasons behind his treatment of two investigations that continue to reverberate in American politics.\\"  Television adaptation  In September 2018, it was reported that CBS Television Studios had bought the rights to the book with the intent of developing it into a miniseries. The series was written by Oscar-nominated screenwriter Billy Ray, who also executive produced alongside Alex Kurtzman, Heather Kadin, and Shane Salerno.

Background In early November 1967, the ARVN IV Corps commander General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn M·∫°nh requested II Field Force commander General Frederick C. Weyand to assist the ARVN 7th and 9th Divisions in a sweep of the Vietcong (VC) Base Area 470 in western Dinh Tuong Province. General Weyand assigned the Mobile Riverine Force and elements of the 3rd Brigade, 9th Infantry Division to the operation. Operation On the morning of 15 November three companies of the 3rd Battalion, 47th Infantry Regiment, were lifted by helicopters into the southern part of the Kien Giang zone to secure a firebase. The companies established Firebase Cudgel () in swampy rice paddy at the intersection of the So Bay Canal and the Ong Tai Creek. At 09:00 CH‚Äì47s delivered Battery C, 2nd Battalion, 4th Artillery Regiment and experimental firing platforms for each of the 6 105 mm howitzers into Cudgel. Battery D was also airlifted in later that day. Company A, 2nd Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment was landed in the northern part of the Kien Giang zone, capturing one VC. Meanwhile, Company B 3rd Battalion, 39th Infantry Regiment and the battalion‚Äôs reconnaissance platoon came under heavy fire from a VC company around midday, losing 2 killed before the VC withdrew. Company C, 2/60th Infantry and Battery B, 2/4th Artillery were then landed by helicopter to establish Firebase Mace (). On the morning of 16 November, 3 battalions from the ARVN 7th Infantry Division were landed by helicopter along the Ton Duc Loc Canal, the northern boundary of the Kien Giang zone and began sweeping south with artillery support from Firebases Cudgel and Mace. Six CIDG companies secured the north of the Kien Giang zone, while elements of the ARVN 9th Infantry Division secured the western side of the zone. At 22:00 on 16 November several VC companies attacked Firebase Mace from the east and west. The attack continued for several hours before the VC withdrew leaving no bodies behind, while 6 Americans were killed. On 17 November, the 3/47th Infantry, swept north from Firebase Cudgel, while 5th Battalion, 60th Infantry (Mechanized), maneuvered south from Mace. 3/47th Infantry returned to Cudgel that afternoon and was then flown back to ƒê·ªìng T√¢m Base Camp, ending its role in the operation and 5/60th Infantry took over responsibility for Firebase Cudgel. =Firebase Cudgel= Attack on Firebase Cudgel, 19 November 1967 The 5/60th Infantry commander Lieutenant Colonel William B. Steele deployed two of his companies in the paddyfields to the north and east of Cudgel with Company C at the firebase to protect Batteries C and D 2/4th Artillery and his reconnaissance platoon on the southern side of Ong Tai Creek accessible only by a narrow footbridge. At 01:50 on 18 November the base was hit by mortar fire and a company from the VC 263rd Battalion attacked the reconnaissance platoon south of the Ong Tai Creek. The defenders detonated their claymore mines and engaged the VC but were gradually forced back to the creek. Some soldiers crossed the footbridge into Cudgel, others swam across the canal, while several wounded men hid themselves beside the creek. The VC set up several recoilless rifles and machine guns south of the creek to support their attack and the artillerymen from Battery C leveled their guns and started firing beehive and high-explosive rounds at the VC. VC recoilless rifle fire hit a howitzer from Battery C igniting the powder charges stored near the weapon and wounded the entire crew. PFC Sammy L. Davis regained consciousness and despite his wounds he loaded and aimed the howitzer eventually knocking out the VC recoilless rifle, after using up all the remaining rounds he then engaged the VC with his M16. Hearing one of the wounded Americans hiding on the south bank, he and PFC William H. Murray ferried 3 wounded Americans across the Ong Tai Creek on an air mattress. Davis then joined another gun crew for the remainder of the battle; for his actions PFC Davis was later awarded the Medal of Honor. On the eastern perimeter several VC companies had avoided the defending U.S. company by approaching from the south and crossing the creek behind the company, and then moving west toward the Cudgel attacking the 1st and 3rd Platoons of Company C. Lt. Col. Steele called for air support and at 02:15 helicopter gunships appeared overhead and proceeded to fire on the VC attacking from the east. At 02:45 an AC‚Äì47 Spooky gunship arrived on station and together with several F‚Äì100s they engaged the VC attacking from the south. The attack continued for another hour before the VC began to withdraw. On policing the battlefield in the morning only 5 VC dead were found, but it was estimated that more than 150 VC had been killed or wounded and their bodies removed. U.S. losses were 7 dead and 98 wounded. As the VC 263rd Battalion withdrew from Firebase Cudgel on the morning of 18 November, they were intercepted by the Mobile Riverine Force consisting of the South Vietnamese 5th Marine Battalion and elements of the 4/47th Infantry. In the battle that followed the VC lost 178 killed and 33 captured, while U.S./ARVN losses were 26 killed and 155 wounded. Aftermath With the sweep of Base Area 470 completed and the VC 263rd Battalion rendered combat ineffective the 3rd Brigade was ordered to return to ƒê·ªìng T√¢m Base Camp.

It is set in the far future, where death by natural causes has been virtually eliminated thanks to advances in technology, and an advanced computer system known as the \\"Thunderhead\\" controls society. The Thunderhead is a form of artificial intelligence who does not make mistakes or have regrets. However, the Thunderhead can communicate with others. The Scythedom is an organization separate from the Thunderhead tasked with deciding who must die, as overpopulation has remained a problem. The novel follows two teenagers, Citra Terranova, and Rowan Damisch, who undergo training as they are recruited into the scythedom by Scythe Faraday. A feature-film adaptation is in the works, with Sera Gamble writing the script. The book was an Honor Book for the Michael L. Printz Award in 2017 for teenage novels.  Plot  Late on a cold day in November, Scythe Faraday visits Citra Terranova's house. At first, Citra assumes that the scythe is there to glean (kill permanently) one of her family members. As it turns out, he just wanted dinner and he leaves with a kitchen knife from Citra's house to glean their neighbor. When he returns the bloodless knife to Citra, she promptly throws it away once he leaves. The focus turns to Rowan Damisch and his classmate Tyger Salazar, a \\"splat junkie\\" whose pastime is jumping off buildings and trying to beat his record for the number of days he is dead. The next day, Rowan meets Scythe Faraday, who is gleaning a classmate of his. Rowan stays in the room while the gleaning is happening and tries to support the boy, which impresses Faraday. Nevertheless, Rowan's classmates blame him for his failure to save the classmate even though it would have been impossible to do so. Citra and Rowan are invited to the Grand Civic Opera and meet for the first time. After the first act, Scythe Faraday greets them and invites them to the Museum of World Art. There, he offers them both apprenticeships to become Scythes, even though only one of them can actually take the position. After talking to their friends and family, Citra and Rowan both reluctantly accept his offer. Both go to live with Scythe Faraday and gradually learn about scythe life. Faraday takes them to witness one of his gleanings, which leaves them both traumatized. At the same time, Scythe Goddard and his three junior scythes mass-glean all the people on a plane and then a number of patrons at a mall with flamethrowers. Scythe Faraday begins training Citra and Rowan by having them accompany him on his gleanings, though they do not participate. On one day each week, they have to stay behind and are assigned chores. Citra is to polish Faraday's weapons and Rowan has to choose the next day's victim. Although Scythes are forbidden from having romantic relations with one another, over time, a romantic relationship develops between the two. Faraday takes Citra and Rowan to a seasonal scythe meeting known as a conclave, where they are tested by Scythe Curie, nicknamed the Grand Dame of Death for her role in the gleaning of the last U.S. President and his Cabinet. Curie asks Citra what was the worst thing that she had ever done, but Citra lies and fails the test. Curie then asks Rowan what he is most scared of. Rowan lies on purpose so that Citra doesn't have to feel ashamed that she failed, which upsets Faraday. Xenocrates, the high scythe, is informed that Scythe Goddard disapproves of Faraday having two apprentices and agrees with him that whichever apprentice is chosen must glean the other at the end of their training. Later, Xenocrates visits Citra and Rowan and explains that Faraday invoked the 7th Commandment of Scythe law, which states that a Scythe can only legally be killed through suicide, or as the Scythedom calls it, \\"self- gleaning\\". This was accomplished by Faraday jumping in front of a train. Citra and Rowan realize that he did this in order to free them of their apprenticeships and thus spare them from death. Unfortunately, this plan would only work if no other scythes agreed to take them as apprentices, but Goddard wishes to take Rowan and Curie agrees to take on Citra. Citra and Curie form a close relationship, but the former is suspicious about the circumstances of Faraday's death and decides to investigate. She learns that the witnesses at the train station had been given immunity by a scythe, and comes to the conclusion that another scythe, probably Goddard, bribed the witnesses and murdered Faraday. Rowan, meanwhile, has learned that Goddard is a sadist who openly flouts the rules of the Scythedom and abuses his power, killing whoever he wants and living in a lavish mansion where his followers party on a daily basis. Rowan befriends one of Goddard's less bloodthirsty junior scythes, Volta, and learns that Goddard has been spreading the idea that scythes should be free to do whatever they want regardless of the consequences. He also discovers the reason why Xenocrates has tolerated Goddard's actions--Esme, a young girl and one of Goddard's wards, is Xenocrates's illegitimate daughter. Citra tells Curie about her suspicions concerning Faraday's death. Xenocrates accuses her of killing him, using her search history as evidence, along with an entry from Faraday's journal in which he expresses regret at taking \\"her\\" as an apprentice. Citra kills herself by jumping off a building, planning to use her time in the revival ward to sort things out. While she recovers, the Thunderhead talks to her, gives her a name, and tell her she will have an important role to play, based on its calculations. Despite not being allowed to interact with or interfere with scythes, the Thunderhead decides that, as Citra is dead, she is not technically under their jurisdiction. Citra wakes up, and Curie tells her they are going to South Merica until Curie can clear things up. Citra learns that the journal entry was not about Citra, but about Curie, who had fallen desperately in love with Faraday and made him suspicious. Because of this, both of them were ultimately punished when their affair was discovered. The two take refuge with one of Curie's friends, who tells them that the Scythedom is on the hunt for Citra. Citra leaves with information from Curie about where to find the person the Thunderhead told her about. To her surprise, the person is Faraday, who reveals that he had faked his death and given Curie information on where to find him. The name Citra got from the Thunderhead was actually Faraday's name before he became a scythe. Goddard takes Rowan and his junior scythes to mass glean a group of anti- scythe cultists, promising Rowan he will glean someone today (even though he isn't allowed). Rowan tries to help people escape, and finds Volta, right before he kills himself out of horror and shame. A furious Rowan finds Goddard tying up a surviving cultist so that Rowan can kill him. Instead, Rowan beheads Goddard with his own sword, kills the other scythes, and starts a fire to destroy their bodies. He takes Goddard's robe and ring and convinces the firemen that the fire is scythe business, preventing them from putting it out. Xenocrates summons Rowan for answers, but the boy points out to him that he knows about Esme. In return, Xenocrates agrees to cover up his crimes. Citra comes back as Curie's apprentice, and she and Rowan face their final test to become scythes--to temporarily kill a close relative: for Citra, her brother; for Rowan, his mom. Despite assurances that their family members will be resurrected afterward, Citra is mortified but ultimately comforts her brother before he dies. Rowan, however, shoots his mother immediately since his family had never been close. He then wonders whether this makes him like Goddard. Citra is declared the winner, and becomes a scythe, choosing the name Anastasia Romanov, to Xenocrates's dismay. Citra explains that Anastasia was a product of a corrupt system, and could have had unrealized potential. She is then told to kill Rowan, but instead \\"accidentally\\" grants him immunity with her new immunity ring, giving him one year to live. She tells Rowan there's a car waiting for him outside, whose driver is revealed to be Faraday. In Citra's journal, she makes note of a \\"Scythe Lucifer\\", a mysterious figure who has gained a reputation for assassinating corrupt scythes. She expresses hope that if she meets him, he'll see her as one of the good ones.

With its creation dating to 1651, the organization remains, along with the Esquirol Hospital in Saint-Maurice, the symbol of psychiatric asylums in France.  History = Creation of the Sainte-Anne Hospital Center = The hospital on the plan of , in 1672 The asylum in 1877 The letters patent of the king confirming the transfer of the services from the hospital of the health of the to the Sainte-Anne hospital date to May 1651. By the contract of July 7, 1651 between the governors of the H√¥tel-Dieu and the founders of power of the Queen Regent Anne of Austria, the H√¥tel-Dieu gave up the buildings and the grounds of the House of Health, the queen giving in exchange the 21 arpents (about 26.5 acres) of land chosen to establish the new hospital, which was to take the name of the patron saint of the mother of Louis XIV, Saint Anne. This little-used establishment was transformed into a farm where the insane patients from the relatively nearby came to work. The Sainte-Anne Farm was the site of important activity for several years because of the work and the initiatives of the patients. In 1772, following a major fire at the H√¥tel-Dieu (which had previously burned down in 1737 and 1742), a redevelopment of four major hospitals was planned in Paris (the Saint-Louis Hospital, the Sainte- Anne Hospital, the and the ). In 1788, following a decree of the Council of State, the architect became responsible for completely rebuilding the hospital. In 1863, Napoleon III decided to create a psychiatric hospital in Paris on the site of the Sainte-Anne Farm. It was referred to as a \\"clinical asylum\\" because it was intended to be a place of mental illness treatment, research, and teaching. Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann, prefect of the Seine Department, was in charge of this operation. Previously prefect of the Yonne Department, he had some years prior built, in collaboration with Dr. Girard de Cailleux (whom he had brought to Paris), the , which served as a model for that of Paris. The , built by Charles-Auguste Questel in 1869 The \\"asylum\\" was inaugurated on January 1, 1867 and the first patient was admitted on May 1, 1867. For many years Sainte-Anne fulfilled its role of protection of mental patients, using the weakly therapeutic treatment means of the time. The asylum saw the development of important and profound medical research, which was often masked by the prejudices that clashed within the walls of the establishment. The asylum endowed itself with a dentistry department in 1892, outpatient consultations‚Äîmade free of charge to reduce hospitalizations‚Äîand a central surgery pavilion for the surgical treatment of patients from asylums in the Seine Department. This important building, which was highly modern at the time, had separate septic and aseptic rooms, hospital rooms, an obstetric section, and radiology, microphotography, and biology laboratories. In 1922, √âdouard Toulouse created the center of mental prophylaxis, the first voluntary service, that is to say, in which the patients were not interned under the law of June 30, 1838. In 1941 one of the first electroencephalographic laboratories in France was installed. The department of pediatric bio- psychopathology, the function of which was to put at the disposal of maladjusted children and their families an original clinical and therapeutic approach that would bring together dual emotional and cognitive aspects, was created in 1947. = Modern era = Gate No. 1, In 1952, Sainte-Anne was the site of the discovery by Jean Delay and his assistant Pierre Deniker of the properties of the first neuroleptic, 4560 RP (Largactil). Since the beginning of the 20th century, the hospital has also been the site of the development of a psychiatry teaching respect for the various components of this discipline. Since the 1960s, the hospital has had a psychiatric orientation and reception center (centre psychiatrique d'orientation et d'accueil, CPOA), a psychiatric emergency service open 24 hours a day and all year round. The hospital has seven sections for adult psychiatry and two sections for child and adolescent psychiatry, which correspond to geographical areas from which the patients come. Sainte-Anne welcomes patients from the 5th, 6th, 14th, 15th, and 16th arrondissements of Paris in various pavilions named after famous doctors (Benjamin Ball, Pierre Janet, , and Piera Aulagnier. The hospital also has the university hospital service (SHU), the clinic for mental illness clinic and the brain (CMME), the regional medical-psychological service (SMPR), a service specializing in the study of addiction called the center for care, support, and prevention in addictology (CSAPA), and a support service for mental health and social exclusion (SMES). Sainte-Anne does not have a (UMD). In addition, the hospital has developed agreements with various emergency departments, including hospitals Ambroise Par√©, Cochin and HEGP (AP-HP), as well as Saint Joseph Hospital. A cafeteria was built in the 1980s, as well as a center of life. Hachette operates this cafeteria through its Relais H brand. A users' house is installed next to this cafeteria; it is a place of information for patients and their relatives. The Sainte-Anne Hospital Center is equipped with an audiovisual service, called \\"broadcast\\", that since 1995 produces and archives certain documents concerning the medical and institutional activity of the hospital. Audiovisual archives are accessible to the media by special request.Contact avec la presse. In recent years, Sainte-Anne Hospital has undergone many changes to become a reference center in psychiatry and neuroscience. The methods of care in psychiatry have evolved considerably over the last twenty years: * Deployment of out-of-hospital and ambulatory facilities, as part of a voluntary sector policy * Strong reduction in the capacity of beds in complete hospitalization * Implementation of conventions and networks, particularly with Assistance Publique - H√¥pitaux de Paris * Active participation in Emergency Reception Services (SAU) * Development of important research works in collaboration with INSERM The neurology department was set up in 1974, and neuroradiology became, at Sainte-Anne Hospital, a state-of-the-art discipline, with innovative equipment, such as a CT scanner and magnetic resonance imaging, which enabled therapeutic radiology. The Raymond-Garcin Center, an integral part of the establishment, brings together the different disciplines of somatic medicine: neurology, with a Neurovascular Unit, Neurosurgery, Neuroradiology, Neurophysiology, Neuro-anatomopathology, Anesthesia-Resuscitation, Stomatology, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. = Education, work, and publications = The hospital welcomes from the .

The name was given to a series of combat actions carried out by the Home Army during the uprising between 19 April 1943 and May 16, 1943.Strzembosz (1978), page 277-296.Witkowski (1984). Background The right-wing faction ≈ªydowski ZwiƒÖzek Wojskowy (≈ªZW) which was founded by former Polish officers, was larger, more established and had closer ties with the Polish resistance, making it better equipped.Wdowi≈Ñski (1963) Zimmerman describes the arm supplies for the uprising as \\"limited but real\\". Specifically, Jewish fighters of the ≈ªZW received from the Polish Home Army: 2 heavy machine guns, 4 light machine guns, 21 submachine guns, 30 rifles, 50 pistols, and over 400 grenades for the uprising. During the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, ≈ªZW is reported to have had about 400 well-armed fighters grouped in 11 units, with 4 units including fighters from the Polish Home Army. According to data collected by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski, the Warsaw district of the AK donated ≈ªOB: 90 pistols with two magazines each and ammunition, 600 hand grenades (approximately 500 defensive and 100 offensive), 1 eraser, 1 submachine gun, and about 165 kg of explosives (mainly seamed production) and about 400 fuses for them (including own production) and plastic from English discharges.Strzembosz (1978) Shortly before the uprising, Polish-Jewish historian Emanuel Ringelblum (who managed to escape from the Warsaw Ghetto, but was later discovered and executed in 1944) visited a ≈ªZW armoury hidden in the basement at 7 Muranowska Street. In his notes, which form part of Oneg Shabbat archives, he reported: > They were armed with revolvers stuck in their belts. Different kinds of > weapons were hung in the large rooms: light machine guns, rifles, revolvers > of different kinds, hand grenades, bags of ammunition, German uniforms, > etc., all of which were utilized to the full in the April \\"action\\".

On the same day, after reports of shooting in the ghetto, the commander of the patrols of the Cpt. J√≥zef Pszenny \\"Chwacki\\" ordered an alarm for a previously created 55-man group, which in the strength of three platoons at 18 o'clock got into the vicinity of the wall on Bonifraterska Street in Warsaw. The aim of diversionary and sapper divisions was to break up the walls and, through the breaches, allow the inhabitants of the ghetto to escape Warszawa Gda≈Ñska station and ≈ªoliborz and from there to Kampinos Forest.Wro≈Ñski (1971), page 190. Loads were prepared within an hour, but the miners had a problem getting into the ghetto wall because of the considerable German forces that were deployed around the walls. On the nearby roofs and balconies, the Germans placed nests heavy machine gun. The German patrols circulated in the streets around. In addition to the planned activities of the \\"Chwacki\\" patrols, three cars of Blue Police arrived to which the AK soldiers from the miners' cover opened fire. A shooting took place, which was joined by German forces along with an armored car resulting in the death of two soldiers of the Home Army, Eugeniusz Morawski and J√≥zef Wilk, and the remaining four were wounded. Two Germans were also killed, several were wounded.Strzembosz (1983), , page 277-296. Details of the Home Army's operation at the Ghetto wall on 19 April 1943 Interview with Jozef Pszenny on Bob Lewandowski TV show April 16, 1978 Channel 26 Chicago The first concept for relieving the Jewish insurgents by the Home Army (Armia Krajowa) with an attack on the Nazis, involving the blowing up a section of the Warsaw ghetto wall, was conceived in early 1943, some months before the actual outbreak of the uprising. At that time, the strength of the AK's Warsaw District was not especially strong. Tomasz Strzembosz in his book \\"Armed Actions of Underground Warsaw 1939-1944\\" leaves no illusions in that, at that time, only the sabotage units were able to take part in an open fight with the Germans. Three units were directly subordinated, among them the forty-member sapper unit of Capt. Jozef Pszenny \\"Chwacki.\\" to take part and the chief commander of the Home Army issued an order to provide military assistance to the ghetto. By February 1943 Kedyw (Kierownictwo Dywersji ‚Äì Directorate of Diversion) assigned a specific unit for the task, which was placed under the command of J√≥zef Pszenny, pseudonym \\"Chwacki\\". This unit had carried out a successful attack on German Rail Transports under \\"Akcja Wieniec\\" in October1942. \\"Chwacki's\\" unit was tasked to attack the police and gendarmerie posts guarding the ghetto from the outside and to demolish part of the wall at a specifically agreed point, securing the opening created to ensure the safe evacuation of the Jews towards ≈ªoliborz, which opened the way to the Kampinos Forest. During discussions conducted with representatives of the Warsaw AK District Command, the Kedyw Command and representatives of ≈ªOB (≈ªydowska Organizacja Bojowa), the Jewish Fighting Organization, it was agreed that a co-ordinated operation was to be carried out on Bonifraterska Street opposite Sapie≈ºy≈Ñska Street. Sapie≈ºy≈Ñska was to be the escape route for the Jews and for the getaway of the protection units. The Jewish Fighting Organization undertook to support the attempt from their side of the ghetto, concentrating their insurgency groups at the agreed point and creating an area of strong resistance. The unit was divided into four sections. On the day of action, according to W≈Çodzimierz Malinowski, Chwacki's unit was divided as follows. Section 1, commanded by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Babczy≈Ñski, with Marian Dukalski, W≈Çodzimierz Malinowski, Zygmunt and Piotr Puchalscy, Edward Branicki, Zygmunt Puterman, Eugeniusz Morawski; section 2: commanded by Mieczys≈Çaw Zborowicz, with Eustachiusz Malinowski, Aleksander Gozdan, Ryszard G√≥recki, Bronis≈Çaw Cholewi≈Ñski, and Stefan GƒÖsiorowski; section 3, commanded by Zbigniew M≈Çynarski, with Czes≈Çaw M≈Çynarski, Orest Fedorenko, Franciszek Jab≈Çonowski, and Henryk Cepek; section 4 commanded by J√≥zef ≈Åapi≈Ñski, with Zygmunt Malinowski, J√≥zef Wilk, Jacek Malczewski, Leonard ≈ªeli≈Ñski, Jerzy Potek, Grzegorz Pszenny. The main goal of the whole operation, the demolition of the ghetto wall, was entrusted to the section under W≈Çadys≈Çaw Babczy≈Ñski's \\"Pastora\\". A gate in a house was selected in the vicinity of Sapie≈ºy≈Ñska and Bonifraterska, where members of the unit were to assemble the two mines onto boards under the supervision of \\"Chwacki\\". The unit, comprising \\"M≈Çodek\\" (Eugeniusz Morawski), \\"Jasny\\" (Jerzy Postek), \\"Tygrys\\" (W≈Çodzimierz Malinowski) and \\"Marek\\" (Marian Dukalski) were tasked with hanging the assembled mines on the Ghetto wall, light the fuses and withdraw as quickly as possible. The mine unit was provided with cover, on one side on the corner of Sapie≈ºy≈Ñska and Bonifraterska, where \\"Pastor\\" and the rest of his section stood guard, and on the opposite corner, \\"Gajowy\\" (Mieczys≈Çaw Zborowicz), \\"Lotnik\\" (Bronis≈Çaw Cholewi≈Ñski) and Ulan (Stefan GƒÖsiorowski). Behind them, in Sapie≈ºy≈Ñska Street, \\"Kruk\\" (Zygmunt Malinowski) and JarzƒÖbek (Tadeusz Zieli≈Ñski). A section under \\"Kret\\" (Zbigniew M≈Çynarski) occupied the area between Sapierzynska and Konwiktorska. The section between Sapierzy≈Ñska and Franciszka≈Ñska was covered by \\"Chmura\\" (J√≥zef ≈Åapi≈Ñski) with \\"Kujawa\\" (Jacek Mackiewicz) and \\"Orlik\\" (J√≥zef Wilk). \\"Chwacki's\\" command post was located at the centre of the proposed action, by the entrance to Sapie≈ºy≈Ñska. The weapons available to the Home Army were very limited \\"One sten gun for each section of six people. With that pistols, a couple of grenades and that was all. Rather not much, although we were then one of the best armed AK units. It must be remembered that it was the spring of 1943 and the Home Army then had far fewer weapons than a year later, during the Uprising. I remember the briefing at Sternik's, one of my soldiers approached me, a young nineteen-year-old boy, named \\"Wilk\\". \\"Mr. Zygmunt, he says restlessly - what will we be doing with these few grenades, after all Germans have machine guns, tanks, artillery, we are taking a hoe to the sun\\". - Zygmunt Malinowski \\"Kruk\\" On the day of the Uprising, \\"Chwacki\\" arranged for his men to meet at 16.00 at \\"Sternika\\", located on Podwale Street where he distributed weapons and gave final orders. Within a short time the units took up their arranged positions along the length of the Ghetto wall. However the large numbers of SS and police units that had concentrated along the axis of Swietjerska, Bonifraterska and Muranowska was unforeseen. Machine guns had been placed on the roofs and balconies of the surrounding houses, which were spreading dense fire beyond the walls into the ghetto. The noise of machine guns and explosions in the ghetto drowned out everything. Passers-by, who had gathered along Bonifraterska to watch created a significant impediment for the units. Whereas the crowd made it possible for \\"Chwacki's\\" units to reach their designated places, the crowd also made it difficult to communicate between the units spread out along a fairly large area. This hampered overall command over the whole of the action. The mine unit took up their positions, under the supporting section of the \\"Pastor\\", in the house at the corner of Sapie≈ºy≈Ñska and Bonifraterska. There the unit proceeded to mount the mines on wooden boards and to arm them. \\"Chwacki\\" and four of his people took up a position, between the gate where the mines were being prepared and \\"Gajowy's\\" position. At the moment when the mine unit came out from behind the gate, three trucks full of Germans and \\"Navy uniformed\\" police arrived. Two left in the direction of Konwiktorska, the last one stopped at the corner of Sapie≈ºy≈Ñska. \\"Chwacki\\" waited for an opportune moment before giving the order to start the action but a German gendarme sees \\"Tygrys\\" and the others carrying the mines and runs towards them armed with a weapon. As a result, \\"Marek\\" and \\"Kruk\\" and then the \\"Gajowy's\\" section open fire. The shooting becomes the signal for action by all the units, which created panic in the crowd and causing people to run in all directions. The group carrying the mine was pushed backwards by the retreating crowd and found themselves exposed and at some distance from the wall. During the firing that followed, the cordon that had been stationed along the wall was largely eliminated with green uniformed bodies lying outstretched along the street On seeing \\"Chwacki\\" and his units, the Germans redirected their machine guns towards them and started firing. The German fire power was overwhelming, as German soldiers were deployed behind the walls of the ghetto and on the roofs of the nearby houses. \\"Chwacki\\" and then \\"Tygrys\\" threw grenades over the ghetto wall in an attempt to limit the effectiveness of the German fire. At the same time the unit carrying the mines, made up of about 70 kg of explosives, made its way under fire towards the ghetto wall. However they were unable to reach the wall as machine gun fire was directed at them, killing \\"M≈Çodek\\" and alongside him \\"Orlik\\". Four others were wounded, one very seriously and so they were forced to retreat leaving the mines on the road. Jewish insurgents also took part and had opened fire and threw grenades from the ghetto side of the wall. However it became apparent that the attempt was not going to succeed. The Germans, after their initial surprise, were able to take control of the situation and the access to the wall by the mine unit or from inside the ghetto by ≈ªOB was no longer possible. \\"Chwacki\\" issued an order to collect the wounded and withdraw. As soon as his men were at a sufficient distance from the mines, he lit the fuses and joined the retreating group. Soon afterwards the mines detonated with a powerful explosion that echoed off the ghetto wall with smoke rising into the sky. The units began their escape along Sapie≈ºy≈Ñska with the wounded soldiers carried on their backs. At Zakroczymska their way was blocked by a group of German airmen who opened fire, but the AK soldiers silenced them with grenades. The units manage to reach the safe house at Nowiniarska and then dispersed in small groups to their homes. \\"Although our task was unsuccessful, the actions of the Home Army did not end there, and the Kedyw diversionary units carried out a dozen or so outings on the Germans liquidating the Ghetto, and we carried out large-scale operations to pull Jews out of the ghetto through the canals as long as and until the Germans filled them all in.

AA‚Äô stacking of graphene planes is another crystalline form of graphite (orthorhombic, Fig. 1) which is metastable for Bernal AB graphite (hexagonal) (Fig. 2) and reveals a nanocrystalline feature. Dr. Jae-Kap Lee discovered the new crystalline form of graphite in 2008 when he grew graphite onto diamond. He realized that graphene layers comprising graphite grew on diamond (111) plane with stacked in the sequence of AA', due to the crystallographic feature of diamond. The non-Bernal AA‚Äô allotrope of graphite is synthesized by the thermal- and plasma-treatment of graphene nanopowders at ~1,500 ¬∞C. The formation of AA‚Äô bilayer graphene nuclei facilitates the preferred texture growth and results in single-crystal AA‚Äô graphite in the form of nanoribbons (1D) or microplates (2D) of a few nm in thickness. Kinetically controlled AA‚Äô graphite exhibits unique nano- and single- crystalline feature and shows quasi-linear behavior near the K-point of the electronic band structure resulting in anomalous optical and acoustic phonon behavior (Fig. 3). Lee et al. also revealed that multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNT) is a type of AA‚Äô graphite.

He was suffect consul as the colleague of Marcus Cocceius Nerva in August of a year during the first half of the first century; which year is still in dispute. Rufinus was an acquaintance of the poet Ovid, who addressed two of his poems to him from his exile in Tomis.Epistulae ex Ponto, I.3, III.4  Date of his consulship  Some scholars, such as Attilio Degrassi, date the consulship of Rufinus and Nerva based on the attested dates the former was governor of Germania Superior, namely the years 43 and 45.ILS 7076; 2283 Paul Gallivan, in his study of the suffect consuls of the reign of Claudius, reasoned from those dates that \\"Rufinus must have assumed the consulship between 39 and 42\\", for which only 40 and 41 have vacancies in August.Gallivan, \\"The Fasti for the Reign of Claudius\\", Classical Quarterly, 28 (1978), p. 417 The other dates their consulship to either 21 or 22, where there are corresponding gaps; no suffect consuls are yet attested for the year 21. Ronald Syme, who argues for one of these years, points out that Nerva was curator aquarum in the year 24, an office which required the consulship first. That Vibius Rufinus' father, Gaius Vibius Rufus, was consul himself not more than 6 years before, is not an insurmountable problem, for Rufus at the time of his consulship was elderly, and the gap in years between his consulship and Rufinus' would have been small. While the 21 years between consulship and being appointed governor of Germania Superior might present an objection to this earlier date, Syme observes that \\"C. Vibius Marsus (suff. 17) succeeding P. Petronius (suff. 19) in Syria, in or about the year 42.\\"Syme, History in Ovid (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978), pp. 84f  Life  Rufinus was the son of Vibius Rufus and Publilia M.f., who had been at a young age the second wife of the orator Cicero.Syme, History in Ovid, p. 84 Pliny the Elder mentions Rufinus as the author of a work in six books on trees, herbs, and flowers. Syme interprets Ovid's poems to indicate Rufinus had been active in the Batonian War, which transpired from AD 6 to the year 9. If so, his role in that conflict is unclear: in different papers Syme speculated that Rufinus had been a military tribune,Syme, \\"Vibius Rufus and Vibius Rufinus\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 43 (1981), p. 375 a quaestor or a legate of quaestorian rank.Syme, History in Ovid, p. 86 Syme speculates whether this military experience might explain his appointment to the important province of Germania Superior \\"many years later, although military experience was a recommendation less powerful than loyalty.\\" Besides the governorship of Germania Superior, the other office Rufinus is known to have held was governor of Asia. Starting with the earlier pair of possible dates for his consulship, Syme notes that for the proconsular governorship of Asia and Africa \\"Tiberius tried for a time to keep to an interval of ten years from a man's consulship\\", and assigns Rufinus' governorship to 36/7; this was the same term that Tiberius barred Gaius Sulpicius Galba from holding the governorship.Syme, History in Ovid, pp. 85f  References  1st-century Romans Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Roman governors of Asia Roman governors of Germania Superior Rufinus, Gaius Vibius ","title":"Gaius Vibius Rufinus"},{"id":"56529171","text":"Ernst B√∂cker (born 12 October 1860 in Herzebrock, (Germany), died 14 August 1946 in Minden, Germany) was a German master craftsman, inventor and businessman. In 1908 he patented an apparatus for the acidification of dough and a little later developed a safe sourdough starter product for rye fermentation processes, revolutionizing the quality of rye breads and subsequently increasing the overall-quality of bread products.  Biography  Ernst B√∂cker was born in Herzebrock, a village not far from the cities of G√ºtersloh and Rheda-Wiedenbr√ºck in today's North Rhine-Westphalia. He was born into a family of Catholic craftsmen and teachers. He had several brothers and sisters. When Ernst B√∂cker was 16 years old, he began an apprenticeship in a yeast factory and distillery in nearby Rheda-Wiedenbr√ºck. At that time, yeast factories and distilleries were often housed together. Sometime in the 1880s, Ernst B√∂cker moved to Minden in Westphalia as a master craftsman. In Minden, he worked for a distillery. Ernst B√∂cker met his future wife Maria Tigges (1868‚Äì1926) in the city and they later got married. The couple had four children, two sons and two girls.Family information available in the Zivilstandsregister of the Minden Kommunalarchiv https://kommunalarchiv- minden.de/ The older one, Hermann (1896‚Äì1956), later worked with his father Ernst in the family business, the younger one became a Franciscan Friar.B√ºrgerbuch der Stadt Minden i. W., JCC Bruns, Minden (Westfalen), 1929. While Ernst B√∂cker worked in Minden, he would often meet with a friend who was a baker. Ernst B√∂cker was intrigued by the problems his friend encountered: rye breads tended to greatly vary in quality because the fermentation process could not be controlled: sometimes the breads were excellent, sometimes inedible. Using his knowledge about yeast and distilling and applying it to the field of baking, Ernst B√∂cker developed an apparatus for the acidification of dough, which was patented in 1908. He subsequently worked on a safe and reliable sourdough starter product, with which rye breads could be produced in constant good quality. He distributed the sourdough starter product from 1910 onwards and also advertised it, naming it Reinzucht-Sauerteig.Brandt, M. and G√§nzle M. (ed.): Handbuch Sauerteig. Hamburg 2006. Ernst B√∂cker continued his full-time work in the distillery and worked on his inventions in his free time, until his son Hermann lost his job due to the hyperinflation crisis in Germany in 1923. They then decided to open a business together which soon had more than 10,000 customers in Germany alone, all using the sourdough starter product developed by Ernst B√∂cker in his kitchen. The company is still in operation today.http://www.abzonline.de/fokus/boecker-feiert- jubilaeum,7069287436.html] During the next two decades, Hermann B√∂cker mostly took over from his now older father. Ernst B√∂cker died in 1946, after having witnessed the destruction of his company in an Aerial bombing conducted by the US Air Force on 28 March 1945, which destroyed large parts of the inner city of Minden. Hermann B√∂cker had the company later rebuild in a different part of the city.

It is one of the largest ice-houses in Azerbaijan. The ice-house is located on the southern side of the city of Nakhchivan, also near the Imamzadeh complex. There is also another ice-house with similar architectural structure in Ordubad, Azerbaijan. There are different ideas on date of built of the ice-house. Academician A.Salamzadeh and K.Mammadzade proclaims that the buzkhana was built in the beginning of XIV century. But it is also accepted that it was built during the reign of Shah Abbas in the XVII century. According to Arif Azizov, the honored architect of the Autonomous Republic and director of the Nakhchivan Scientific-Restoration Production Department, the ice-houses were built on the banks of the rivers historically. Design The monument is in rectangular form. Its length is 20 meters, width is 9 meters, and height is 9.6 meters. A ventilation system was installated. It allowed the use of ice reserves efficiently in summer. There are six small domes on the roof. Typical features of the Nakhchivan ice-house are natural construction from bricks, the light and dynamic design scheme. The ice was destroyed as a result of intensive erosion. In 2013, it was restored by the instruction of the Chairman of the Supreme Assembly of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. Usage In ancient times, local residents used ice-houses to protect themselves and their personal food products against heat in summer. Ice was made during winter months. Drinking water of the river was shed into the cellar to make it ice. Usage of straw was protecting melt of the ice. In the 20th century local residents started using refrigerators in their houses, which decreased the use of ice-houses.

The organization was created by Svyatoslav Bondarenko, a 34-year-old man from Ukraine. In February 2018, authorities in the United States indicted 36 individuals involved with the organization and charges them with racketeering conspiracy, possession of 15 or more access devices and aiding and abetting, as of which 13 have been arrested as of 8 February 2018. The US Justice Department stated that as of March 2017, the organization had 10,901 registered members and was the \\"largest cyber fraud enterprise prosecutions ever undertaken by the Department of Justice\\" and had resulted in $530 million in actual losses, with an estimated $2.2 billion in intended losses.  History  The organization was formed by Svyatoslav Bondarenko, a 34-year-old man from Ukraine. He intended for the organization to grow into the internet's largest carding group. The website was a place where vendors could advertise stolen or counterfeit credit cards or related items. According to the indictment, the first vendor to advertise their items was Muhammad Shiraz who advertised large dumps of stolen credit card details for sale.  Organization Roles  The organization was split into different roles, the administrators, the super moderators, the moderators, vendors, VIP members and members. The administrators served as the governing council of the group, initially made up of \\"reputable\\" vendors. They handled management decisions, long-term strategic planning and managing of users of the site. Administrators had full privileges and access to the computer servers hosting Infraud's websites. Super Moderators oversaw subject- matter specific areas of the forums which were either part of their expertise or was part of their geographical location. They were limited to editing and deleting posts by members as well as resolving disputes. They often reviewed other vendor's products or services which was in their area of expertise. Moderators were similar to super moderators, however, they had less authority within the forums and were generally limited to moderating one or two specific sub-forums. Vendors sold illicit product or services to other members of the organization which would usually be done through the vendor's website. Products or services would be reviewed by members to ensure that products which were purchased were of high quality and vendors of low-quality products or services did not remain in the organization. VIP members were premiere members of the Infraud Organization. The role would be given to longstanding or notable members of the organization to distinguish them between members and vendors. Members were general members of the organization who used the site to gather and provide information about perpetrating criminal activity as well as to use the vendors to facilitate unlawful purchases of credit card dumps and other illegal products or services.  Indictment  The indictment was released on 7 February 2018. It listed 36 individuals who were alleged to be involved with the organization. They are: * Svyatoslav Bondarkeno, the founder of Infraud from Ukraine. He allegedly stopped posted on and/or using Infraud in 2015. *Aldo Ymeraj, an Albanian vendor who advertised credit card dumps. * Sergey Medvedev, the co-founder of Infraud and has been an active member since 2010. After Bondarkeno disappeared in 2015, he took over as owner and administrator of Infraud after saying that Bondarkeno had \\"gone missing\\". Medvedev was arrested in Bangkok, Thailand with over 100,000 bitcoins (worth roughly $822 million at the time). * Amjad Ali, a Pakistani member of Infraud since December 2010 who was promoted to Super Moderator status. He was involved with the sale of CVVs and purchased in excess of 130 compromised credit card dumps from Musliu. * Roland Patrick N‚ÄôDjimbi Tchikaya, a French member of Infraud who was a vendor involved with the sale of CVVs.

Doe #7 used Medvedev's service to complete a criminal transaction. * John Doe #8, a vendor of compromised online bank logins. Doe #8 claimed that he had 795,000 HSBC logins for sale. According to the indictment, many vendors redirected traffic and potential purchases of their products to their own websites in order to complete the transaction. Each individual who owned a website has their website listed in the indictment. Some vendors occasionally gave out free credit card dumps or compromised PayPal logins for fun, to showcase their products. The indictment contains information about the crimes the individuals face, the roles of the organization, a list of each individuals name and their alias used within the Infraud organization, a brief explanation of their part in Infraud and examples of some of the crimes each individual committed. The charges in the indictment are only allegations, and are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  Infraud Takedown  On 2 August 2017, an undercover Homeland Security Investigations agent posing as a member purchased 15 credit card dumps from Doe #6 and 15 from Novak. On 4 August 2017, the agent purchased 54 compromised credit card dumps from Novak and 15 more from Doe #6. A joint operation between the United States, European, Australian and Asian law enforcement agencies arrested thirteen defendants, as of 8 February 2018. The Infraud website was taken down and a message saying \\"This operation is a coordinated effort by United States, European, Australian and Asian law enforcement agencies to disrupt and dismantle the transnational criminal enterprise known as Infraud Organization\\".

Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan from United States Department of Justice said that \\"as alleged in the indictment, Infraud operated like a business to facilitate cyberfraud on a global scale\\" and that \\"the Department of Justice refuses to allow these cybercriminals to use the perceived anonymity of the Internet as a shield for their crimes. We are committed to working closely with our international counterparts to identify, investigate, and bring to justice the perpetrators of these crimes, wherever in the world they operate.\\" Acting Executive Associate Director Benner from Homeland Security Investigations mentioned that \\"criminal cyber organizations like Infraud threaten not just U.S. citizens but people in every corner of the globe\\" and that \\"the actions of computer hackers and identity thieves not only harm countless innocent Americans, but the threat they pose to our financial system and global commerce cannot be overstated\\".

He is regularly called upon to lead projects involving singers and instrumentalists in the pre- baroque and baroque repertoire (sacred music by Henry Du Mont with the choir of Namur, motets and psalms by Praetorius, Vespers by Monteverdi, Bach's cantatas and Mass in B minor). This pedagogical practice led him to create the Ensemble Ludus Modalis,Ludus Modalis website made up of a dozen singers A capella, whose repertoire mainly covers the period of sacred music from the Renaissance and early Baroque periods. Boterf has recorded many disks both for the following companies Harmonia Mundi, Alpha, Erato Records, CBS, Auvidis and Ram√©e with the Ensemble Ludus Modalis and also Ricercar for the first two components of an Henry Du Mont (1610-1684) project.Biography of Bruno Boterf on the website of Ludus Modalis  Selected discography  ;With A Doi tenori (and Gilles Ragon) * 1999: Giacomo Carissimi and Girolamo Frescobaldi: Duetti da chiesa nella Roma del Primo seicento (Label: L'empreinte digitale) ;With Akad√™mia * 1991: Claudio Monteverdi: Vespro della beata vergine * 1993: Francesco Cavalli: Missa pro defunctis * 1994: Palestrina: Vergine bella: motets et madrigaux ;With the Ensemble Cl√©ment-Janequin at Harmonia Mundi * 1984: Heinrich Sch√ºtz: the Seven Last Words * 1988: Cl√©ment Janequin: la Chasse et autres chansons * 1988: Josquin Desprez: Chansons * 1989: Pierre de La Rue: Messe L'homme arm√© - Requiem * 1992: Roland de Lassus: Chansons * 1994: Une f√™te chez Rabelais * 1994: Chansons sur des po√®mes de Ronsard * 2000: Psaumes et chansons de la R√©forme * 2003: Antoine Brumel : Messe et ecce terrae motus ;With Les Arts florissants * 1990: Marc-Antoine Charpentier: Le Malade imaginaire ;With Georges Guillard * 1996: Jehan Alain, vocal and instrumental works (vol. 2) (ARION, ARN 68321).

It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to twenty five green to yellowish- green flowers which sometimes have red markings. Australian and New Zealand authorities use the name Corunastylis pumila. Description Genoplesium pumilum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between five and twenty five green to yellowish-green red flowers are crowded along a flowering stem long and taller than the leaf. The flowers lean forwards and are about long, wide and sometimes have red markings. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, about long and wide, sometimes with a small gland on its tip. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, about long, wide, spread apart from each other and often have a gland at the tip. The petals are egg-shaped, about long and wide with hairless margins but sometimes a gland on the tip. The labellum is egg- shaped, thick and fleshy, long, wide with fine teeth along its edges. There is a callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs between January and May in Australia and between February and October in New Zealand. Taxonomy and naming The green midge orchid was first formally described in 1853 by Joseph Dalton Hooker who gave it the name Prasophyllum pumilum and published the description in Flora Novae-Zelandiae. In 1989, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Genoplesium pumilum and in 2002 changed the name again to Corunastylis pumila. The specific epithet (pumilum) is a Latin word meaning \\"dwarfish\\" or \\"little\\". Distribution and habitat Genoplesium pumilum grows in wet heath, wallum and the edges of swamps. In Tasmania it grows on buttongrass plains and in New Zealand on sparsely vegetated gumland scrub. In New South Wales it occurs mainly in coastal districts and in Victoria in the far east and on French Island. It is also common in coastal areas of Tasmania and in New Zealand is found on the North and Chatham Islands.

It was named for Lt. Richard W. Scott, killed in the Scott Massacre of 1817 and never known to have visited the Fort. (The Fort replaced a much smaller fort or stockade, named Camp Crawford for Secretary of War William H. Crawford, and not to be confused with Fort Crawford (Alabama).) The need for a fort became evident during the War of 1812, when the British identified this undefended United States border, and in 1814 built two forts on the Apalachicola River, into which the Flint River flows: a strong fort at Prospect Bluff and a smaller one, Nicolls' Outpost, at the river juncture. This was in Spanish Florida, but Spain had neither the resources nor the inclination to do anything about this fort in a location to them remote. The Negro Fort (1816) However, the end of the War of 1812 in 1815 meant the fort from which to attack the United States was no longer needed. When withdrawing in 1815, the British deliberately left what was soon called the Negro Fort, with all its weapons and ordnance, in the hands of those disciplined, paid-off Corps of Colonial Marines black troops who chose to remain. Surrounding it was a sizeable community of runaway slaves, Red Stick Creeks (some of whom were forced out of the Mississippi Territory and Georgia), and the occasional white trader. The existence of a Negro Fort, as the U.S. Army called it, was anathema to Georgia plantation owners, who feared this threat to their slaves. It was a known safe destination for runaway slaves from as far as Virginia and Tennessee. Raids from lawless Spanish Florida into U.S. territory, calling on slaves to follow them to freedom, are well documented. The only practical way to supply Fort Scott was by river; a land route would have had to go through wilderness, and was not seriously considered. Instead, the Apalachicola River was used. At the same time, the Americans, now able to reconnoitre the Negro Fort, concluded that it would be very difficult to assault by land. It had been excellently situated and well built. Two concerns about the Apalachicola River reinforced each other. On the one hand, artillery of sufficient size to destroy the fort would have to be brought in by boat, so U.S. gunboats, stored in Pass Christian after their successful use in the Battle of New Orleans, were sent for. On the other hand, supply boats to or from Fort Scott had to pass right in front of the Negro Fort. As they were fired upon, this conveniently provided the casus belli. U.S. forces attacked and destroyed the fort in the Battle of Negro Fort (1816)‚Äîsometimes called the opening battle of the Seminole Wars. (There is disagreement about just when the First Seminole War began; it was not recognized as a war until much later.) Fort Scott abandoned and then rebuilt (1816‚Äì1817) Once Negro Fort was destroyed in August, 1816, there seemed to be no more need for Fort Scott, and it was abandoned in November of 1816. Red Stick warriors soon burned the fort to the ground. The U.S. Army sent Captain Samuel Donoho in June, 1817, assisted in July by Brevet Major David E. Twiggs and his company from the 7th U.S. Infantry, to rebuild it. Protection along the U.S.‚ÄìFlorida border proved to still be necessary, even though the War of 1812 was over; raids were regularly launched into Georgia from Spanish Florida by Red Sticks, other Seminoles, and maroons (escaped slaves). Fort Scott would remain staffed until Florida actually became a U.S. territory in November of 1821. \\"Unlike smaller posts such as Fort Gaines and Fort Hughes, the fort was a massive affair designed to house a full brigade of U.S. troops,\\" and it would remain staffed by \\"a large force\\" until 1821. It was \\"the supply and logistics base for operations during the First Seminole War.\\" Battle of Fowltown (1817) Fort Scott was the base for the Battle of Fowltown, another candidate for the first battle of the Seminole Wars. (Note that there were four different locations for Fowltown, which was forced to move four times in three years; the attack was on the third Fowltown, just south of modern Bainbridge, Georgia.) The Red Stick Chief Neamathla visited Major Twiggs soon after his arrival and warned him not to cross the Flint River. He maintained that the land to the south of the river belonged to the Red Stick Mikasuki Creeks, who had not been party to the Treaty of Fort Jackson, ceding this land to the United States, and did not feel bound by it. In fact, they took the Flint River as separating the United States from Spanish Florida. The Secretary of War, John C. Calhoun, ordered General Gaines to remove Neamathla and his followers from this land. A road was cut from Fort Gaines, on the north. Additional support from Mobile was on its way up the Apalachicola River. When General Gaines and troops from Fort Gaines arrived at Fort Scott on November 19, 1817, he ordered Major Twiggs to go to Fowltown and bring back Neamathla and his leading men. Twiggs left November 20 and reached Fowltown (the third Fowltown) the next morning. While shots were exchanged, called by some the first shots of the Seminole War, neither side scored a victory. The Americans failed to capture Neamathla, but his tribe of Mikasuki abandoned the land the U.S. claimed did not belong to them. Another clash took place on November 23. A blockhouse named Fort Hughes was built in modern Bainbridge, Georgia, close to Fowltown. Scott massacre (November, 1817) A direct result a few days later was the Scott Massacre, an attack by the Red Sticks on the vessel of Lieutenant Richard W. Scott, coming up the Apalachicola River headed for what was then Camp Crawford. Only 7 of the 45 on the boat survived. The news of this attack was widely reported in the U.S. press and contributed to President James Monroe's order to General Andrew Jackson to \\"punish\\" the Red Sticks regardless of whether they were in U.S. or Florida territory. The Camp, which he never visited, was renamed Fort Scott in his honor. It also served both symbolically and logistically as the foundation of the First Seminole War. Battle of Ocheesee and subsequent siege (December 1817‚ÄìMarch 1818) This was followed, on December 15, by the Battle of Ocheesee. Josiah Francis (Francis the Prophet), ally of Neamathla, succeeded in pinning down a supply convoy headed up the Apalachicola River for Fort Gaines and Fort Scott. Warriors from both sides of the river fired on the boats simultaneously, and the sailors could not show themselves to navigate. The siege was not broken until mid-March, 1818, when Andrew Jackson marched south from Fort Gaines to Fort Scott, and from there to the former Negro Fort, where he ordered Fort Gadsden to be constructed. Second abandonment of Fort Scott (1821) Both Fort Scott and the Fort Gadsden which replaced the destroyed Negro Fort were expensive to keep supplied (\\"the more remote the post, the higher the expense\\"). Many men got ill from what at the time were believed to be \\"bad airs\\" (mal-aria). Starting in 1820 Fort Scott's soldiers were besieged by what is now recognized as malaria, yellow fever, and the resultant dysentery; in 1820, 769 of the 780 soldiers at the post were ill. \\"Soldiers considered the fort to be the deadliest military assignment in the country because of numerous illnesses and deaths there.\\" The causes of these diseases spread by mosquitoes, much less treatment or prevention, were not known until later in the nineteenth century, and sending sick soldiers to Fort Gadsden actually spread the diseases. Fort Scott was evacuated (abandoned) September 27‚Äì28, 1821, the month the treaty took effect. The site of Fort Scott is under the manmade Lake Seminole. Camp Recovery On a high hill across the Flint River from Fort Scott was Camp Recovery, created when Thomas Lawson, a camp doctor and future Surgeon General, decided to move on September 18, 1820, about 70 invalid soldiers \\"likely to be benefitted by a change of air\\". Partly because of heavy rains, soldiers died rather than recovered, and a number are buried in the vicinity, though the graves have not been located. It was abandoned November 23, 1820.

One of his most important works (although not as famous as his Irises and Red and White Plum Blossoms screens), Wind God and Thunder God consists of a pair of two-folded by≈çbu folding screens painted with ink and color on gold-foiled paper, measuring 421.6 by 464.8 centimetres (166.0 in √ó 183.0 in) each. The work dates from the early 18th century: probably circa 1700, as it is not generally considered one of K≈çrin's later works, and he died in 1716. The attribution to K≈çrin has not been disputed. It is designated an Important Cultural Property of Japan. At some point Sakai H≈çitsu owned the painting, and in fact he painted one of his most famous works, Flowering Plants of Summer and Autumn, on the back of these screens. The monumental two- sided by≈çbu screens became a symbol of the Rinpa tradition, but both sides of the screens have since been separated to protect them from damage. K≈çrin's painting is a close replica of an original by Tawaraya S≈çtatsu, dated from the 17th century, and designated a National Treasure. In turn, H≈çitsu painted a version in the 19th century. All three versions of the work were displayed together for the first time in seventy-five years in 2015, at the Kyoto National Museum exhibition \\"Rinpa: The Aesthetics of the Capital\\". An even later version of the work was created by the late Rinpa artist Suzuki Kiitsu, a student of H≈çitsu. The screens are now part of the collection of the Tokyo National Museum, where they are exhibited occasionally. The last time they were on display was from May 30 to July 2, 2017, in Room 7 of the Honkan (Japanese Gallery). Previously they were on display at the Tokyo National Museum in 2008, 2012, 2013, and 2014.

Between the mid-1960s and mid-1970s she took prominent roles in a succession of East German cinema and television films. After refusing, in 1982, to continue acting as an informant for the Stasi she joined the Women for Peace movement in or before 1983. She herself now came under increased levels of Stasi surveillance, and in 1984 the authorities granted her an \\"Emigration passport\\". She moved to West Berlin in 1984.  Life  Edeltraud Kulikowski was born in Litzmannstadt (as it became known between 1939 and 1945). By the time of Kulikowski's birth, in the context of the Second World War, the city had become a German city. Her first employment was in the manufacturing sector, but even at that point she was also participating in stage productions with a workers' theatre company. Before she had even received any formal cinema training she had appeared in two films: \\"Das Lied vom Trompeter\\" (\\"The Trumpeter's song,\\" 1964) and \\"Egon und das achte Weltwunder\\" (\\"Egon and the eighth wonder of the world,\\" 1964). She became one of the best known of the younger generation of movie stars in East Germany. In the \\"workers' film\\", \\"Das Lied vom Trompeter\\" she was appearing beside established stars such as Rolf R√∂mer, G√ºnther Simon and J√ºrgen Frohriep; but it was her role alongside Gunter Scho√ü in the television version of \\"Egon und das achte Weltwunder\\", based on the eponymous best-selling novel by Joachim Wohlgemuth, that most convincingly captured the life-style of the coming generation. Directed by her then husband, the producer and screenwriter Horst Seemann (1937‚Äì2000), she became one of the nation's favourite young movie stars, featuring several times on the title pages of film magazines. Later in 1964 she embarked on a training period at the National Theatre school (as it was called at that time) in Berlin-Niedersch√∂neweide, then moving on to the National Academy for Film and Television in Potsdam-Babelsberg. She took major roles in Horst Seemann's films between 1966 and 1974. She appeared in the music-comedy \\"Hochzeitsnacht im Regen\\" \\"\\"Marriage night in the rain\\"\\" in 1966/67 with Frank Sch√∂bel and Herbert K√∂fer. The film makers thought this film inoffensive, but it was rejected by the state-backed film critics. Writing in Eulenspiegel, Renate Holland-Moritz offered the scathing opinion that the film provided no evidence that the leading actress, Traudl Kulikowsky, knew how to act.Renate Holland-Moritz. In: Eulenspiegel, 27, 1967. Junge Welt, the newspaper of the party's youth wing, complained that it presented a \\"self centred view of the world\\" (\\"ichbezogene Weltsicht\\"). Even from within the national Film Studio (DEFA) Seemann's work was sometimes strongly attacked, although his emotionally charged films were generally well received by East German cinema audiences. In 1969 Kulikowsky starred in Seemann's \\"Zeit zu leben\\" (\\"Time to live\\"). That was followed in 1971 by a major supporting role in \\"Liebeserkl√§rung an Gisa Tonius\\" (\\"Declaration of Love to Gisa Tonius\\"). In 1972 she took part in \\"Reife Kirschen\\" (\\"Ripe Cherries\\"), another \\"workers' film\\", starring as the daughter of a building worker, Brigade Leader Kamp, the part of Kamp being portrayed by G√ºnther Simon. The story concerns Kamp's decision to leave his home, garden and family in order to move to the Baltic coast and work on the construction of a Nuclear power plant. The film was subject to official criticism: \\"The powerful characterisations in the first part of the film then become blurred: an idyllic harmony devalues the earlier conflicts which had initially demanded to be taken seriously\\".Film- und Fernsehkunst der DDR, Berlin 1979, p. 386 Seemann's final contemporary film in which she appeared, \\"Suse, liebe Suse\\" (\\"Suse, darling Suse\\") presents the slow development and emancipation of a young truck driver, played by Traudl Kulikowsky, who leaves her boyfriend for a Soviet engineer. A reassuringly political slant comes from the deserted boyfriend's wish to emigrate. (The slaughter of war and sustained emigration during the ensuing decade had left the country desperately short of working age population, so \\"escape from the republic\\" was regularly condemned in official media and, for most comrades, became illegal/impossible after 1961.) \\"A consciously progressive film, not convincing either in content or presentation: pathetic and overblown\\" was the verdict of the critic at the Film Service. After separating from Seemann in 1975 Kulikowsky's film and television appearances became far less frequent. She did appear in a film based on the television police series Polizeiruf 110 (Die Rechnung geht nicht auf) during 1975 and, in a supporting role, in the television film \\"√úber sieben Br√ºcken musst du geh'n\\" (\\"You must go over seven bridges\\") in 1978. Her final appearance on East German screens involved a minor role in \\"Darf ich Petruschka zu dir sagen?\\" (\\"Might I say something to you, Petruschka?\\"), a 1981 feature film directed by Karl-Heinz Heymann. A few years after moving to the west, in 1989 she returned to the world of film, this time as the director of a brief documentary entitled \\"Agonie\\", but by now she was no longer able to generate significant impact.  Ministry for State Security  It was only after the changes that restored democracy and then led, formally in October 1990, to reunification, that knowledge of Traudl Kulikowsky's Stasi associations became generally available. From 1974 she was in receipt of regular payments from the Ministry for State Security (Stasi), contributing information to the ministry's files as an informer (\\"IM\\") between 1974 and 1982. She is listed in the Stasi archives under the alias \\"IM Galina Mark\\". Those on whom she reported to her handlers include the high-profile intellectuals Walter Janka and Christa Wolf, both of whom were near neighbour's in the prestigious residential suburb of Kleinmachnow. In 1981 Elke Erb and Ekkehard Maa√ü were added to her list of targets. During the summer of 1981 she accompanied Erb on a lengthy officially sanctioned trip to Georgia in order to take care of Erb's ten year old son. Kulikowsky took the opportunity to open all the correspondence addressed to Erb, copy down the contents and pass them to her Stasi contacts. Other potential \\"political dissidents\\" in the country's artistic establishment who get a mention in the context of Kulikowski's Stasi involvement include Peter Brasch, Heiner Carow, Franz F√ºhmann, Stefan Heym, and Rainer Kirsch. After her acting career collapsed in the mid 1970s, Kulikowsky became increasingly dependent financially on the Stasi who by this time were even paying the repair bills on her Trabant. The writer Joachim Walther believes Kulikowsky submitted notice of her intention to stop working for the Stasi in 1982 because she felt \\"unsupported\\". In the Autumn/Fall of 1979 she embarked on a writing course at the Johannes Becker Institute in Leipzig. From this point she became determined to publish a book. When she approached publishers, however, she received only well-founded advice along the lines that she should find some other career. The Stasi went to remarkable lengths to try and redirect or accommodate her ambitions: they tried to find her fulfilling work back at the national Film Studio (DEFA). When that did not work they recruited a mentor to support \\"IM Galina\\" with her prose, but success remained elusive. As she became more and more frustrated by the failure of her literary career to take off she even wrote a letter to Kurt Hager, a Politburo member with a particular focus on education and the arts. Her final letter to the authorities, sent in 1983, was addressed to Erich Honecker. In it, she complained that she was no longer getting acting work, and she included an application for an emigration permit: the application was granted. Following her withdrawal from her Stasi activities Kulikowsky became involved with Women for Peace. She never became a \\"regular member\\", but she did sign two of the movement's petitions calling on the government to engage in open discussion on the subject of women serving in the People's Army. The issue had risen up the political agenda following the enactment of legislation in 1982 whereby, in the event of national emergency, women aged between 8 and 50 might be conscripted for military service to defend the fatherland. By 1983 several hundred women had been called in for the medical examinations necessary to assess their suitability for call-up, should the national emergency envisaged ever arise. There were demonstrations: for at least one of these the participants dressed themselves in black so as to signal their opposition to conscription. Some also wrote to the military high command for their localities (\\"Wehrkreiskommando\\"), giving written notice of their refusal to serve in the army. Traudl Kulikowsky's letter was particularly angry, and is revealing on various levels. The emigration permit finally came through in 1984. Traudl Kulikowsky made use of it.

Forbes estimates his net worth at $3.3 billion. Early life Alexander Ponomarenko was born on October 27, 1964 in Crimea, Belogorsk City, Ukrainian SSR. He earned a bachelor's degree from Simferopol State University, followed by a master's from Russian State Academy of Management. From 1983 to 1985, Ponomarenko served in airborne divisions of the armed forces. By the end of the 1980s, he was the junior boxing champion of Ukraine. Career Ponomarenko has worked for much of his career with fellow billionaire Alexander Skorobogatko. In the late 1980s, Ponomarenko, together with Skorobogatko, founded an enterprise in the Crimea that specialised in perfume products and building materials. The two business partners later moved to Moscow and founded the Russian General Bank in 1996. In 2006, according to Vedomosti, the bank was sold to Hungarian OTP Bank for $477 million. Following the financial crisis in 1998, the partners started buying up shares in cargo companies that eventually combined to form Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port (NCSP), which became the largest seaport in Russia. In 2004, Ponomarenko was appointed the Chairman of NCSP. In 2007, NCSP had its initial public offering, listing 19.3% of total equity on the London Stock Exchange for US$955 million. At the beginning of 2011, the majority stake of NCSP was sold to Summa Capital and Transneft for US$2.5 billion. The trust acting in the interests of the families of Ponomarenko and Skorobogatko invested a significant part of the funds from the sale of NCSP to form the TPS Real Estate company to invest in the construction and operation of shopping and entertainment complexes. Among the main assets of this company are TRK Gallery Krasnodar, Gallery Novosibirsk, Moremoll in Sochi, Ocean Plaza in Kiev, and Oceania and Khorosho malls in Moscow. In 2013, the above trust acting in the interests of the families of Ponomarenko and Skorobogatko established TPS Avia Holding to invest in infrastructure development at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport. In 2013, the company won a bid to develop a new cargo terminal at the airport. Ponomarenko joined the Board of Directors of JSC Sheremetyevo International Airport in 2015 and was elected its Chairman in 2016. In 2016, TPS Avia secured 68% stake in Sheremetyevo Airport and committed to investing US$840 million to upgrade and expand the airport's infrastructure. In September 2020, Ponomarenko was named to Kommersant‚Äôs list of the top business leaders in Russia. He was among 46 business leaders within a list of the country‚Äôs top 1,000 managers chosen by a committee of experts from the Russian Managers Association. Ponomarenko previously made the list in 2019. He ranked 31st on the Forbes list of \\"200 Richest Businessmen in Russia\\" in 2020. Personal life Ponomarenko is married, with three children and lives in Moscow. In 2011, Ponomarenko purchased a \\"palace allegedly constructed for the private benefit of Russian president Vladimir Putin\\", now known as Putin's Palace. At the time of the purchase, Ponomarenko indicated that he had picked the palace up for \\"a song\\" and that the value of the complex may be as much as $350 million when the project was complete. In 2017, it was reported in The Guardian that Ponomarenko had acquired Cypriot citizenship in 2016 through a \\"Golden visa\\" scheme.

According to Abbott Gleason's father, Basil Gray did not approve of higher education for girls and so she did not attend university, instead, being very determined, she had gone to live in Cambridge for several years and attended the lectures at the university there and got to know the professors. She was already studying Russian modernism but did not visit the country until 1955 when she went as a ballet student.Cover notes in Camilla Gray, The Great Experiment: Russian Art 1863‚Äì1922. Thames & Hudson, London, 1962. She also trained as a Russian interpreter. Russian art Gray first began to research modern Russian art in an organised way in 1957, travelling internationally to gather material from individuals and institutions. She interviewed the surviving Russian artists of the modern period in Paris and then spent most of 1958 researching at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and at Yale University. She supported herself by working at the New York Public Library. Her writing began to be published, starting with an article on Kazimir Malevich that appeared in The Times in 1958 and another on El Lissitzky appearing in Typographica in 1959. She found that nobody she discussed Lissitsky with had heard of him. Also in 1959, she wrote the catalogue for the Kazimir Malevich exhibition held at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London. In 1960 she visited Russia again for six weeks, researching in archives and interviewing surviving artists in time to capture their memories. In 1961 she wrote the catalogue for the Arts Council-supported retrospective exhibition of Mikhail Larionov and Natalia Goncharova's paintings and designs for the theatre. Gray won backing for her research from a number of influential figures such as Herbert Read, Kenneth Clark, Isaiah Berlin, and Alfred H. Barr. Barr was particularly encouraging and helpful; he had visited Russia in the 1920s and met some of the people Gray was writing about and in a letter of 1961 urged her to publish her work despite her misgivings about possible errors in the text, saying that the book would, nonetheless, be a sound foundation for future scholars.\\"Introduction to the Revised Edition\\" by Marian Burleigh-Motley in The Russian Experiment in Art: 1863‚Äì1922. Thames & Hudson, London, 1986. pp. 6‚Äì8. The Great Experiment: Russian Art 1863‚Äì1922 was published in a large format by Thames & Hudson in 1962 and broke new ground in explaining Russian avant-garde art outside Russia. It was dedicated to Gray's mother \\"to whom this book owes its inspiration and realization\\". In the introduction to the first edition, Gray commented on the difficulties she had encountered in compiling the work, needing to combine information from newspaper articles, unpublished memoirs, exhibition catalogues and the often contradictory recollections of living artists.\\"Introduction to the Original Edition\\" by Camilla Gray in The Russian Experiment in Art: 1863‚Äì1922. Thames & Hudson, London, 1986. pp. 280‚Äì281. It was criticised by some reviewers for the seemingly arbitrary cut-off of 1922, for a certain amount of generalisation and excessive detail in other parts, and has to some extent been superseded by later more nuanced works that make a greater distinction between the individual Constructivists. However, there was also general praise for the achievement of what was clearly a very difficult task that nobody else had been able to tackle in an area that was previously largely unknown to Western scholars. Gray's publishers asked her to write a book specifically about Constructivism and she won a Leverhulme Trust award to pay for the research but was unable to proceed as the British Council would not endorse the project because she had no university degree. In 1971, The Great Experiment was retitled The Russian Experiment in Art: 1863‚Äì1922 and published in Thames & Hudson's small format World of Art series without the artist's statements from the original. A revised and expanded edition by Marian Burleigh-Motley was published in the same series in 1986. Gray proposed an exhibition of Soviet revolutionary art in Britain and despite obstacles at home due to misunderstandings and official Soviet antipathy to abstract art it was realised in 1971 as Art in Revolution: Soviet Art and Design since 1917 which ran at the Hayward Gallery from 26 February to 18 April 1971 with the support of the Arts Council.\\"Camilla Gray, The Russian Experiment in Art 1863‚Äì1922 (1962 and 1971)\\" by Verity Clarkson in \\"Preface\\" by Robin Campbell & Norbert Lynton in Art in Revolution: Soviet Art and Design since 1917 Hayward Gallery London 26 February to 18 April 1971.

Soon afterwards, the management practices leading to the Volkswagen emissions scandal began. Facts The Commission claimed that the Volkswagen Act 1960 provisions on golden shares violated free movement of capital under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 63. The VA 1960 ¬ß2(1) restricted the number of shareholder voting rights to 20% of the company, and ¬ß4(3) allowed a minority of 20% of shareholders to block any decisions. The Lower Saxony government held those shares. Germany argued that the 1960 law was based on a private agreement between workers, trade unions and the state, and so was not within the free movement of capital provisions under TFEU article 63, which did not have horizontal direct effect. Workers and trade unions had relinquished a claim for ownership over the company for assurance of protection against any large shareholder who could gain control over the company. Judgment The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union held that the Volkswagen Act 1960 violated TFEU art 63. It was disproportionate for the government's stated aim of protecting workers or minority shareholders, or for industrial policy. Significance Soon after the decision, which removed shareholder control from the State of Lower Saxony, the management practices leading to the Volkswagen emissions scandal began. In 2015, it was revealed that Volkswagen management had systematically deceived US, EU and other authorities about the level of toxic emissions from diesel exhaust engines. VW engineers fixed software to switch off emissions reduction filters while VW cars were driving, but switch on when being tested in regulator laboratories. This occurred while the major shareholders, who directly acquired dominance from the decision, were members of the Porsche family with a controlling share and appointing 5 of the supervisory board members, and the petroleum-based economy's Qatar Investment Authority with a 17% stake.J Armour, 'Volkswagen‚Äôs Emissions Scandal: Lessons for Corporate Governance?

In a case that made national headlines, he litigated against the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in the defense of the Mount Soledad Cross in San Diego. The battle over the religious symbol, which lasted more than 25 years, is one of the longest in the history on the United States. Limandri has a private law practice, and in 2002 he founded the Freedom of Conscience Defense Fund to pay for his pro bono work on behalf of religious freedom.  Early life and education  LiMandri was born in San Diego, California, in 1955. He attended Catholic primary and secondary schools, and graduated from Saint Augustine High School in 1973. His undergraduate studies were taken at the University of San Diego (USD), also a Catholic school. In 1977 LiMandri completed his graduate studies at USD. He returned to Saint Augustine High School for a brief period to work as a teacher and wrestling coach. Then he began his graduate work at Georgetown Law. During this period he spent a year studying abroad in England at Oxford University.  Career  Mount Soledad Cross =Legal practice= LiMandri started practicing law in San Diego in 1985. His primary areas are business law and personal injury. As of 2015, five attorneys are on staff at his law firm. His first venture into religious freedom casework came in 2003 when he filed an amicus brief in a case to keep \\"Under God\\" in the Pledge of Allegiance. In the lawsuit, Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, the United States Supreme Court ruled against Newdow. The effort by the ACLU to remove the Mount Soledad Cross began in 1998. Erected in 1954, the tall mountaintop cross is a familiar San Diego landmark. LiMandri's involvement began in 2004. For the next twelve years the case worked its way through the state and federal judiciaries until ownership by a private organization was established in 2016. LiMandri's efforts to prevent the removal of the cross drew national attention and is his most high-profile case. In 2007, LiMandri brought a lawsuit against the City of San Diego when they forced four firefighters to drive their fire truck in the annual gay pride parade against their deeply held religious beliefs. At the parade the firefighters were sexually harassed. In a jury trial, the verdict was returned in favor of the firefighters. In 2011 the verdict was affirmed by the California Supreme Court. At the 2009 Miss USA pageant, then-Miss California Carrie Prejean was asked about same-sex marriage. Her reply, \\"I believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman\\", caused controversy. When the Miss California USA Pageant fired Prejean on an unrelated violation of her contract, LiMandri filed a lawsuit on her behalf; the pageant then filled a counter-suit. After a homemade sex video depicting Prejean surfaced, both parties agreed to an undisclosed settlement. =Freedom of Conscience Defense Fund= In 2012 LiMandri founded the Freedom of Conscience Defense Fund (FCDF) to help fund his pro bono work on behalf of religious freedom. FCDF's mission is to provide \\"pro bono legal services and spearheads educational initiatives on issues related to religious freedom, bioethics, and family values.\\" FCDF is an allied firm with Alliance Defending Freedom, the Christian legal group. Maggie Gallagher, former chairman of National Organization for Marriage, is a boardmember. =Other cases= \\"What was your name?\\" is a 2014 song by singer- songwriter Joyce Bartholomew. She said the song was inspired by an epiphany: \\"There has been 58 million abortions since 1973... and how many babies have been aborted and killed, and who would they have become if they had been given a chance?\\" The song's music video had received 52,000 views on YouTube when the website deleted the video, stating that it had been \\"removed because its content violated YouTube's Terms of Service.\\" LiMandri brought suit against YouTube on Bartholomew's behalf for libel. The Sixth District Court of Appeal ruled against Bartholomew, but the video was eventually restored. In 2017 two women entered Cathy Miller's cakeshop, Tastries Bakery, and requested a wedding cake for their same-sex wedding. Miller refused to create the custom cake due to her deeply held religious beliefs and the state sought a court order to force her to bake the cake. The case is similar to one currently before the Supreme Court Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. On February 5, 2018, a judge of the Superior Court of California agreed with LiMandri's Free Speech argument and issued a preliminary ruling in favor of Miller to which LiMandri said was a \\"significant victory for faith and freedom.\\"  Personal life  LiMandri met his wife, Barbara, when she was working as a paralegal. The couple have five children. LiMandri is a devout Catholic.

The B&LR; obtained an Act of Parliament giving it the right to lease the K&LJR; in 1836. On 8 August 1845, along with the B&LR; and the L&MR;, the K&LJR; was amalgamated into the Grand Junction Railway (GJR) which, with others, became part of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) on 16 July 1846. The line started from the B&LR;'s terminus in Westleigh and crossed the Leeds and Liverpool Canal before heading south towards Kenyon. Stations were built at Bradshaw Leach and Kenyon. As soon as it opened on 3 January 1831, goods trains could access of line between Bolton and Liverpool and a few months later a passenger service to Liverpool started. John Hargreaves, an established carrier in Bolton leased the running rights over the K&LJR; and the L&MR; using his own engines and rolling stock until 31 December 1845. Regular passenger services between Bolton and Kenyon ended in March 1954 and traffic from Leigh ended when the Tyldesley Loopline was closed in 1969. Background Nine of the Kenyon and Leigh Junction Railway (K&LJR;) Company's board of 13 directors were members of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR;) Company. The southern end of the B&LR; was near the north bank of the Leigh branch of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal where it had transhipment facilities. In 1825 the B&LR; had experienced considerable opposition to its bill in Parliament and, to ensure its passing, had agreed to not cross either the Leeds and Liverpool or the Bridgewater Canals making the B&LR; into a feeder for the canal. When the K&LJR; presented its bill to Parliament in 1828, MPs were more amenable towards railway companies and the canal company withdrew its opposition to the railway crossing the canal. In 1829 the company received royal assent to build a single-track line from the end of the Bolton and Leigh Railway near Twiss (now Twist) Lane in Westleigh to Kenyon, where a junction would be made with the L&MR; which was at an advanced stage of construction. The Act specified that the bridge over the canal was to have a minimum clearance of above the water to accommodate Mersey flats with lowered masts and its arch was to be at least in span accommodating a towpath. As compensation the K&LJR; was required to pay the canal company ¬£500 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) and another ¬£15 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) per day for interruptions to canal traffic during the bridge's construction. The company raised the estimated cost of the line, ¬£22,946, (equivalent to ¬£ in ) by issuing shares. Construction Robert Stephenson's plan for the line, dated 1828 and now in the United Kingdom Parliament's archives The line of the railway was surveyed by Robert Stephenson and the engineer in charge was either Charles Vignoles or John Rastrick. In September 1829 the railway company asked for tenders, in one sum, to be received by 1 October, to complete the entire railway line. Plans could be seen at the company's office in John St Liverpool or at Mr Rastrick's office in Stourbridge. The company would provide the land, wrought iron rails, cast iron rail chairs, castings and iron work for the turn outs but everything else would have to be provided including the workforce. The work involved 107,000 cubic yards of earthworks, two bridges with between the parapet walls, two arch bridges both to in length, a arch to be long, 24 occupation gates, seven larger gates, five cottages for the gate keepers, about of fencing, of cylindrical brick culvert, sundry brickwork, 10,070 stone blocks, 20,140 oak pins, wood sleepers, gravel for the road, laying the rails and completing the line which, with branches, would be about in length. When completed the line was in length. When built, it crossed the Bolton and St Helens turnpike road via a level crossing. The crossing was replaced by an overbridge when the line was doubled in 1864. The K&LJR; joined the L&MR; at a triangular junction. The K&LJR; line towards Liverpool passed through Bolton Junction station, the line towards Manchester avoided it. The link in the Manchester direction was closed by the time the 1849 Ordnance Survey map was published. The canal bridge was substantially rebuilt in the mid 1930s and in turn was replaced by a concrete bridge carrying the A579 Atherleigh Way in the mid 1980s. The road was built on the line of the former railway. Opening and operation The line opened on 3 January 1831 for freight traffic between Bolton and Liverpool. A special train for \\"Gentlemen\\" ran from Bolton to Newton Races on 2 June 1831. Passenger trains began running the from Bolton to Liverpool on 13 June 1831. The journey took an hour and 40 minutes The K&LJR; and B&LR; worked closely as trains ran over both lines to access the Liverpool and Manchester line. Two passenger trains daily ran in each direction between Bolton and Liverpool one in the morning and the other in the afternoon, each train providing inside covered accommodation and outside wooden seats in open wagons. In 1834 the B&LR; leased the running of the railway to John Hargreaves, an established carrier of Bolton. Hargreaves was granted running rights over the K&LJR; and the L&MR; using his own engines and rolling stock. Hargreaves was an established carrier on roads and canals before the railway was built and the main carrier from north west England into Scotland, the equal of Pickfords who controlled the trade to the south of Manchester. By the mid 1830s Hargreaves had about 200 wagons. Hargreaves became a pioneer of excursions by rail, running Sunday trips from Bolton to Liverpool as early as 1841. In 1843 he ran excursions to London and two years later to Manchester. The GJR terminated the Hargreaves leases on 31 December 1845. Meanwhile the B&LR; obtained an Act of Parliament giving it the right to lease the K&LJR; for 25 years or purchase it for ¬£44,750 ( (equivalent to ¬£ in ) in 1836. In 1844 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway had been negotiating with the Bolton and Leigh Railway and the K&LJR; with a view to an amalgamation, these negotiations were made more complicated by the initial inclusion of the North Union Railway in the proposed merger and then even more complicated when the Grand Junction Railway became interested, all the lines were connected and provided through running for each others trains. Negotiations were reaching their conclusions when the NUR shareholders rejected their part in the amalgamation. At this juncture the K&LJR; simplified the arrangements by agreeing to be purchased outright by the B&LR; (under the provisions of the 1836 Act) so the amalgamation took place on 8 August 1845 without the NUR and the K&LJR; became part of an enlarged Grand Junction Railway. The following year on 16 July 1846 the GJR was amalgamated with others into the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR;). Stations and junctions Two stations were opened on the line: *Bolton Junction opened on 15 September 1830 on the L&MR; and was renamed in June 1843. Shaw suggests that two stations may have been built at Bolton Junction, one at the terminus of the K&LJR; and the L&MR; station, although this may mean the platforms were not connected. Butt records a single station. *Bradshaw Leach opened on 11 June 1831 together with the other passenger facilities on the B&LR; and was renamed in 1877. A junction was formed to the north of Pennington station in 1864 when the LNWR's Tyldesley Loopline opened via Bedford Leigh and the track between Kenyon Junction and the junction at Pennington was doubled at a cost of ¬£7,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Double track north from the Pennington junction to Atherton Junction opened on 31 May 1880. In 1885 the junction with the Tyldesley Loopline, by now known as Pennington South Junction, became more complicated when the LNWR opened the Westleigh Line slightly to its north providing a connection to the Tyldesley to Wigan line at Bickershaw. East and west junctions north of Pennington station were made in 1903 when the L&NWR; constructed two link lines between the Tyldesley Loopline and the Westleigh Line bridging over the Bolton & Kenyon Line and a mineral line to collieries in Westleigh. Closure Regular passenger services on the line between Bolton and Kenyon ended on 29 March 1954 but wakes week traffic to North Wales continued until 1958. With the demise of goods traffic, Crook Street Yard in Bolton closed in April 1965 and private sidings were closed by October 1967. The only coal traffic using the line in the 1960s was from Jackson's sidings in Tyldesley. Passenger traffic from the Tyldesley Loopline closed following the Beeching cuts on 5 May 1969 when all the stations on that line were closed. The track was lifted by 1969.

It grows as a tree to high, with dark grey or black stringy bark and blue-grey foliage. The yellow flowers appear from March to July. It grows in dry scrub, open forest or mixed savannah woodland. Indigenous people used the wood as fuel and to make hunting spears. Cattle can eat the foliage as fodder. Description The small tree has a single stem which is layered with dead bark and an umbrella shaped habit. It typically grows to a height of around . The stringy bark is dark grey to black in colour, and the trunk can be up to thick. When cut or exposed, the bark will emit an odour reminiscent of violets. The evergreen linear to slightly curved phyllodes are around in length and wide. Veins are only found in the midrib area and are raised on both surfaces of the blade. The foliage has a blue-grey hue overall. It flowers between about March and July, producing moderately dense flower-spikes that are in length with small lemon yellow flowers. Following flowering linear woody brown seed pods are formed that are raised over the seeds and constricted between. The pods have a length of around and a width of . The black seeds within have a broadly elliptic shape and are in length. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Joseph Maiden in 1920 as part of the work Notes on Acacias, No. IV, with descriptions of new species as published in the Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. It was reclassified in 1987 by Leslie Pedley as Racosperma shirleyi, then transferred back to its original genus in 2001. A. shirleyi is most closely related to Acacia distans and Acacia catenulata and all have a resemblance to Acacia aneura. It is known to form hybrids with Acacia rhodoxylon in parts of Queensland. The species name honours John Shirley, an educationist and scientist, who also served on the council of the Royal Society of Queensland for 33 years and was twice President. Distribution The tree is found in temperate and semi-arid parts of north eastern Australia in the state Queensland and the Northern Territory and covers an area of around . In Queensland it is found to the north and east from around Toowoomba and eastwards into the Northern Territory to around the Victoria River. It is often part of monsoon forest or dry scrubland but is not a part of rainforest communities. It is also found in low open forests or mixed savannah woodlands and can form dense stands. Uses and cultivation The wood is hard and heavy, and is a rich dark brown with pale sapwood. Indigenous people used the wood as fuel and to make hunting spears. The bark contains tannins and can be used as an astringent for treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery when taken internally. It is not suitable for use as fence posts as it tends to rot when in the ground. Lancewood is a hardy tree with potential as a shelter or screening plant. Cattle can eat its leaves for fodder. The plant grows well in a sunny position in a well-drained soil and is drought tolerant. It grows in mainly frost-free regions but can tolerate a light frost. It is suitable in areas of shallow and nutrient deficient slightly acid soils. Seedlings are initially slow growing but can increase in size by per year once established. They can produce flowers at an age of 14 months. Seeds need to be pretreated by scarification prior to planting. It has a symbiotic relationship with different types of soil bacteria that can form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil.

Grigorishin heads Energy Standard Group, which controls a number of enterprises in Zaporizhzhia and Ukrrichflot as well as eight Ukrainian regional energy-distribution companies. In the past owned Sumy NPO named after M.V. Frunze. On 1 November 2018 became one of 322 Ukrainian citizens against whom the Russian Federation imposed sanctions. Biography Born in a family of engineers-constructors of aviation engines who worked the whole life at elite Soviet construction bureau ‚ÄúProgress‚Äù. In 1982 graduated from physical-mathematics school ‚Ññ28 in Zaporizhzhia and was accepted to Moscow Physical-Technical Institute (MFTI). Studied first on physical and quantum electronics faculty and then in a theoretical group named after Landau on the faculty of general and applied physics with the quarters at the Institute of Theoretical Physics at Chernogolovka town. Upon graduation from MFTI in 1988 started to work at theoretical department of the Institute of Spectrography of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in the city of Troitsk where in 1991 he passed PH.D defense on the topic ‚ÄúLight propagation in nonlinear unordered environments‚Äù. In 1992 started to do business, establishing together with a few other graduates of MFTI his first company ‚ÄúAragornSoft‚Äù, which was developing system solutions in the sphere of IT-technologies. Starting from 1993 ‚ÄúTsentralnaya Optovaya Metallobaza‚Äù company, established by the same partners, engaged in trading of ferrous material and ferro-alloys, soon becoming one of the biggest metal traders in the territory of CIS. In 1995, having divided the business with former partners, together with a new partner established ‚ÄúSozidanie‚Äù firm. From 1996 to 2000, during big privatization campaign in Ukraine, Konstantin Grigorishin invested in controlling and material shareholdings of a number of metallurgic, industrial machine building, transport-logistics and energy distribution (so-called oblenergo) companies. Business assets of Grigorishin, including in energy, industrial machine building and transport- logistics sectors, mainly located in the territory of Ukraine. Grigorishin is the majority investor in established by him in 2005 Energy Standard Group, which indirectly owns material or controlling shareholdings in a number of enterprises in Zaporizhzhia and a couple of Ukrainian regional energy- distribution companies (oblenergo).

Assets  According to his own statement, 95% of his business is concentrated in Ukrainian assets. The main assets are in industrial machine-building, shipbuilding and energy distribution sectors [6] as well as transport-logistics company ‚ÄúUkrrichflot‚Äù. In energy distribution has controlling shareholdings in Lugansk and Vinnitsa regional energy distribution companies, the rest six oblenergo in question (Zaporizhzhia, Poltava, Sumy, Chernigiv, Cherkassy (30%) and Ternopil) are controlled together with other shareholders, amongst which is Ihor Kolomoyskyi (starting from 2010 Poltava, Sumy and Chernigiv oblenergo were managed jointly with Kolomoyskiy. According to ‚ÄúEkonomicheskaya Pravda‚Äù, in spring 2016 preparation to divide assets has started, upon results of which Kolomoyskiy will obtain Poltava oblenergo). From the beginning of 2000th indirectly owns investments in majority shareholdings of ‚ÄúZaporozhtransformator‚Äù (monopolist in production of Ukrainian power transformers and reactors) and ‚ÄúZaporozhskiy Kabelniy Zavod‚Äù. According to Arseniy Yatsenyuk, Prime Minister of Ukraine in 2014‚Äì2015, Grogorishin controls Ukrainian energy sector. On January 20, 2016 on the Cabinet of Ministers session Yatsenyuk officially applied to the Security Service of Ukraine with a request to investigate connection of Grigorishin to financing of anti-Ukrainian political forces (including the Communist Party) and his cooperation with FSB. Grigorishin himself actively criticized Yatsenyuk whom he treated very negatively. On 15 March 2016 applied for Ukrainian citizenship. The grounds for this were mentioned birth or permanent domicile in Ukraine before August 24, 1991. = List of assets = As of autumn 2019, Grigorishin controlled: * Vinnitsaoblenergo (50%) * Zaporozhtransformator (100%) * ‚ÄúZaporozhskiy Kabelniy Zavod‚Äù (100%) * Zaporozheoblenergo (in partnership with Igor Kolomoyskiy, the latter has management control) * Poltavaoblenergo (in partnership with Igor Kolomoyskiy, the latter has management control) * Pidpryiemstvo ‚ÄúKyiv‚Äù * Sumyoblenergo (in partnership with Igor Kolomoyskiy, Grigorishin has management control) * Ternopoloblenergo (in partnership with Igor Kolomoyskiy, the latter has management control) * UkrRichFlot (100%) * Chernogovoblenergo (in partnership with Igor Kolomoyskiy, Grigorishin has management control)  Political connections  During election campaign 2002 the name of Konstantin Grigorishin was mentioned in connection with sponsorship of Victor Yushenko‚Äôs ‚ÄúNasha Ukraina‚Äù political party and ‚ÄúYabloko‚Äù. In the same time financed SDPU(o). In 2000th was named as one of key financiers of the Communist Party of Ukraine which he ceased to support in 2012. According to Grigorishin's own words, he supported the Communist Party of Ukraine because ‚Äúhe needed protection from Yanukovich‚Äù. In the same time he was considered as one of the sponsors of ‚ÄúOrange Revolution‚Äù, although he denied it. In 2014-2015 Konstantin Grogorishin actively criticized Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk whose work on said position he treated very negatively. In response, Arseniy Yatsenyuk on January 20, 2016 on the Cabinet of Minister's session accused Grigorishin of sabotage activities and work for foreign intelligence service. On February 26, 2020 Pecherskiy District Court of Kyiv supported Konstantin Grigorishin's claim against the Cabinet of Ministers of Arseniy Yatsenyuk for defense of reputation and goodwill and refutation of false information. The Court ruled to refute false information spread by Arseniy Petrovich Yatsenyuk, which undermined reputation and goodwill of Konstantin Ivanovich Grigorishin that ‚Äúhe is an example of those who steels funds from the budget and then finances anti-Ukrainian political forces and reports to FSB and is the agent of FSB‚Äù. The Court obliged former Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers to refute circulated false information.  Litigations  Konstantin Grigorishin, as all prominent businessmen of the end of 1990th ‚Äì beginning of 2000th, suffered pressure from the side of political groups in power aimed to seize a share in his business. The main attacks here were done by Victor Pinchuk, the son-in-law of Leonid Kuchma, the President of Ukraine at the time being, by the group of Victor Medvedchuk ‚Äì Igor Surkis as well as by Igor Kolomyskiy. During one of the attacks on his business in 2002, Grigorishin was arrested. That provocative act was discussed at the hearings in the House of Lords of the UK and covered in the speech of Victor Yushenko, the leader of Ukrainian opposition at the time being, in Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Grigorishin spent a week in detention and after then the charges were withdrawn. After being released, Grigorishin accused Grigoriy Surkis and Victor Medvedchuk in organization of said provocative act. Being concerned about his and his family's safety, Grigorishin had to leave Ukraine and temporary moved to Moscow. According to Konstantin Grigorishin's words, that all led to necessity, as a countermeasure to protect his business, to engage in politics and support opposition. In December 2008 filed a claim to the High Court of Justice in London against Igor Surkis and Valentin Zgurskiy, the shareholders of ‚ÄúDynamo Kyiv‚Äù football club, regarding preemption right to buy 98% of shares in ‚ÄúDynamo Kyiv‚Äù for 32 mln USD. According to Grigorishin, he was defrauded in 2004 when he was not allowed to exercise the right of preemption. Under the court decision, Igor Kolomoyskiy was ordered to pay Grigorishin 15 mln USD. In 2008 the Security Service of Ukraine prohibited Grigorishin to enter the country for five years in connection with organization of ‚Äúraider‚Äù (hostile takeover) attacks on Turboatom company. In June 2009, Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the court of the first instance, which recognized the actions of the Security Service as unlawful. In 2009 filed a lawsuit to invalidate the agreement on sale in 2006 of 61% shares in ‚ÄúUNTK‚Äù company, which controls broadcasting licence of ‚ÄúInter‚Äù TV-channel. On 26 February the Commercial Court of Kyiv ordered to arrest the shares of the TV-channel and demanded Ministry of Interior and General Prosecutor's Office to investigate the circumstances of death of Igor Pluzhnikov, the former owner of the TV-channel, and subsequent sale of controlling block of shares in December 2009 to the companies of Valeriy Khoroshkovskiy. That lawsuit was treated as one of confrontation acts between Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Timoshenko and businessman Dmitry Firtash. On April 13, 2016 at the hearing at the Moscow City Court, the investigator announced that Konstantin Grigorishin had been put on the wanted list in connection with tax evasion case for 675 mln RUB. The prosecution believes that Grigorishin together with his partner have not paid taxes for 675 934 000 RUB, and, therefore, inflicted damage to the state budget in the same amount. On May 9, 2016, the London Court of International Arbitration decided in favor of Vadim Novinskiy and Vladimir Lukyanenko, minority shareholders of Sumy NPO named after M.V. Frunze, against the majority shareholder, Konstantin Grigorishin. According to arbitration award, Grigorishin had breached shareholders‚Äô agreement and, therefore, is obliged to pay the plaintiffs more than 300 mln USD. Until the end of 2018 the arbitration decision was not abided, in summer 2019 Grigorishin and Lukyanenko signed the settlement agreement, under which the debt was satisfied by transfer of 29% shares in Kharkivoblenergo and Kharkivenergosbut as well as of the controlling shareholding (more than 50%+1 share) in Sumy NPO named after M.V. Frunze. In December 2019, the deal was closed. Quite illustrative is the following case. In August 2016 some Khasan Ediev (native-born of Dzhalka village of Gudermes district of Chechnya, whose monthly income according to filed tax returns varied from 20 to 100 thousand RUB) filed a claim to the District Court of Gudermes against Konstantin Grigorishin for repayment of principal debt, accrued interest and sanctions under the loan agreement. It went about 110 mln USD in cash in hand which Khasan Ediev allegedly provided to Konstantin Grigorishin, and which the latter has not returned. On 10 November 2016, the District Court of Gudermes awarded Grigorishin to pay 230 mln USD. Subsequently, in October 2017 this decision was upheld by the order of the High Court of Chechen Republic, after which enforcement proceedings were commenced. In December 2017, bailiffs accompanied by the representatives of Khasan Ediev arrived at apartments and house in Moscow owned by Konstantin Grigorishin with the aim to organize eviction of said real estate and movable property located there. Moreover, the bailiffs subsequently arrested that real estate, already arrested in course of criminal case against Grigorishin.  Wealth  In 2012 ‚ÄúForbes‚Äù magazine estimated Grigorishin's wealth at US$1.2 billion, in 2011 ‚Äì at US$1.3 billion, in 2013 ‚Äì at US$1.814 billion. In its turn, Ukrainian magazine ‚ÄúFocus‚Äù in 2012 estimated total value of assets owned by Grigorishin at US$2.019 billion (7th place in the list of wealthiest Ukrainians), in 2015 ‚Äì at US$920 million (6th place).  Interests  Since 1993, Konstantin Grigorishin is engaged in art collection, since 2004 on permanent basis his art collection is managed by Olga Vaschilina. By 2012, he owned 238 oil on canvas paintings and about 500 pages of graphics. Today part of his Russian collection is seized by the court. Main sport activity of Grigorishin is swimming, where he qualified as a master at international class.

Architecture The main castle of Schloss Burgau The earliest findings can be traced back to the year 1100. The building was constructed on a motte. Even today the manor house is situated on an island with a diameter of 50 meters. The keep also dates back to the Middle Ages; after that the southern, eastern and northern wings of the main castle were constructed. In the 16th century a bay, richly decorated with reliefs, was added to the house tower. This room is also referred to as the gazebo room. In 1675 it was decided to renovate the damaged castle. Around 1730 the conversion into a baroque three-wing building began. Additionally, from 1685 onwards the construction of the Vorburg commenced, an outer bailey consisting of a three-winged building used for the management of the castle. Like the inner bailey, it was also surrounded by a water-filled moat. After the castle was destroyed during the Second World War in 1944, the restoration process lasted from 1975 to 1998. Today The Vorburg Nowadays, the castle is a tourist attraction and is used as an event location, with various local societies using the premises. It is known as a popular destination with its pond and surrounding forest as well as the castle caf√©. The main part of the castle offers 450 square metres of exhibition space and a room for conferences. There are regular concerts and events in the Winkelsaal, a hall in the outer ward, and the courtyard. D√ºren's registry office offers a marriage service in the gazebo room of the castle on select Saturdays during the year. Hans Holbein the Younger and the Portrait of Anne of Cleves Anne of Cleves by Hans Holbein the Younger In 1539 the artist Hans Holbein the Younger, known as one of the greatest portraitists of the 16th century and King's Painter to Henry VIII, travelled to D√ºren to paint a portrait of Anne of Cleves. After seeing Holbein's portrait of her, King Henry sent a delegation to D√ºren to negotiate the courtship and to bring Anne back to England. However, meeting her was a disappointment for him, the marriage was never consummated and an annulment soon followed. Anne received the title of ‚ÄúThe King's Sister‚Äú, a generous settlement and was often invited to court.

Apama serves as a platform for performing streaming analytics over a range of high volume/low latency inputs and applications, such as IoT devices, financial exchanges, fraud detection, social media and similar. Users can define data patterns to listen for and actions to take when these patterns are found, which are defined in the provided Domain Specific Language called the Event Processing Language (EPL). The core Apama engine is written in C++; the process can also optionally contain a JVM for interacting with user created Java code. Apama focuses on high throughput, low latency and memory efficient performance; used in both Intel benchmarks and smaller machines such as the Raspberry Pi, routers and other Edge/IoT devices. It is particularly noteworthy within the CEP space as being one of the earliest projects, a long term market leader, and innovator of many patents.  History  Apama Ltd. was founded in 1999 by Dr John Bates, Dr Giles Nelson and Dr Mohamad Afshar, who met while undertaking research at the Cambridge University Department of Computer Science and Technology. In 2005, Apama Limited was acquired by Progress Software for $25 million. In 2013, Apama was acquired by Software AG from Progress for an undisclosed amount. In 2016, a freemium version, Apama Community Edition, was released, alongside supporting forums and GitHub spaces.  Overview = Event Processing Language = Applications for Apama are authored in the Event Processing Language (EPL). EPL contains language features designed purely for Event Driven Programming,http://www.apamacommunity.com/wp- content/uploads/2016/06/SAG_The_Apama_Platform_20PG_WP_Jun16-Web.pdf including: * Events - Simple data structures containing fields and actions * Monitors - Similar to classes in other languages, monitors contain listeners and actions and are loaded upon injection * Listeners - Declarative patterns defining interesting conditions/combinations of events. Aggregation, temporal and filtering operators are supported * Actions - Imperative functions, usually run by listeners upon activation or monitors upon load * Contexts - Similar to threads, monitors exist inside contexts * Channels - Mechanism for communicating between contexts and external systems * Streams - Ordered partitions of events with support for aggregation and SQL-like queries The EPL C++/Java-like syntax is designed to create CEP applications succinctly in conjunction with the above features, an example of which can be found below: event MyEvent { integer myInt; sequence myListOfStrings; boolean myBool; } monitor MyMonitor { action onload() { spawn worker() to context(\\"mySideThread\\"); } action worker() { on all MyEvent(myInt>10) as myCoassignedEvent -> MyEvent(myInt>20) or MyEvent(myBool=true) within 30.0 { if(doWork(myCoassignedEvent.myListOfStrings) != true) { log \\"Problem!\\"; } } } action doWork(sequence) returns boolean { // do work on the list return true; } } = Apama Queries = Apama Queries is an alternate language for creating rules over defined data sets, such as the past five minutes of received data or past twenty events received, in an automatically multi-threaded environment that scales across machines. Apama Queries are better suited for monitoring very large sets, such as bank transactions. Typically, each entity (i.e. account holder) will be partitioned and processed independently of the rest of the set. Queries and Monitors can communicate via channels. An example of the previous scenario can be found below: query FindSuspiciousWithdrawals { parameters { float DURATION; float THRESHOLD; } inputs { Withdrawal() key cardNumber within DURATION; } find every Withdrawal as w where w.amount > 100 select last(w.transactionId) as tid select last(w.cardNumber) as cid having last(w.amount) > THRESHOLD * avg(w.amount) { send SuspiciousTransaction(tid, cid) to SuspiciousTransactionManager; } } = Designer = The Software AG Designer is an Eclipse based IDE with special support for developing and deploying Apama applications, which is included in a standard installation. Features include code assistance, package management, profiling, GUI development and deployment management. = Plugins = Apama supports the ability for users to create plugins to extend capability. These plugins come in two forms, EPL plugins (to add features to EPL) and Connectivity plugins (for communicating with the outside world). C++ and Java APIs are available for both plugin types. Connectivity plugins come in two forms, codecs (which translate data from one format to another, such as the internal Apama representation to JSON) and transports (which handle sending/receiving to/from external systems, such as JMS). Connections to external systems are made by composing chains of codecs and one transport to achieve the desired topology; these connections are defined by a YAML configuration file at start-up or through dynamic management with the provided tools. Several pre-built plugins for popular technologies (e.g. R, MQTT, Kafka, HTTP, MatLab) as well as connectivity to other Software AG products (e.g. Universal Messaging, Terracotta, Cumulocity) are shipped with Apama installations. = Persistence = The Apama process is entirely in memory and supports an optional SQLite based in-built persistence system. Additionally, the connectivity API supports reliable messaging to systems that support it, such as JMS. Finally, a pre- built distributed memory store plugin is provided with standard installations for use with appropriate back-ends. = Visualization = Apama provides an in-built dashboarding technology developed from within the Software AG Designer, as well as native connections to Software AG's MashZone NextGen.

She showed little ability as a two-year-old, winning one minor race from five starts. On her three-year-old debut however, she produced a strong late run to take the Epsom Oaks at odds of 25/1, much to the surprise of her owner and trainer. She never won again and was retired from racing at the end of the year. She had some influence as a broodmare through the descendants of her daughter Ocean Light. Background Glass Doll was a bay mare bred in England by Jack Barnato Joel who also owned her during her racing career. She was trained by Joel's private trainer Charles Morton at Wantage in Berkshire. Glass Doll was a small and unprepossessing filly: the writer \\"Vigilant\\" described her as \\"a pony in height\\" with \\"no bone, no substance [and] no muscle\\". Her sire Isinglass was an outstanding racehorse who won the Triple Crown in 1893. The best of his other progeny included Cherry Lass and the 2000 Guineas winner Louvois. Glass Doll's dam Fota produced at least seven other winners including the Great Metropolitan Handicap winner Congratulation. She was a great-granddaughter of the influential British broodmare Young Alice. Racing career=1906: two-year-old season= Glass Doll ran five times as a two-year-old in 1906. She was placed three times but recorded her only victory in October at Nottingham Racecourse in the seven furlong Sherwood Forest Nursery Plate. =1907: three-year-old season= On 7 of June Glass Doll made her first appearance as a three-year-old the 129th running of the Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse and started a 25/1 outsider in a fourteen-runner field. She was not fancied by her owner or trainer who believed that she would not stay the distance but allowed her to take her chance in what appeared to be a sub-standard field. Their view of her chances had not been improved when she was beaten in a training gallop by a very moderate colt named Golden Knight. The 1000 Guineas winner Witch Elm started 2/1 favourite ahead of Mimosa (9/2), with Maya, Lady Hasty, Altitude and Laodamia among the other fancied runner. Ridden by Herbert \\"Bert\\" Randall, Glass Doll was not among the early leaders as Lady Hasty set the pace before giving way to Laodamia in the straight. A furlong from the finish Glass Doll emerged from the pack with a \\"remarkable\\" burst of speed, caught Laomedia in the last fifty yards and won by half a length with Lady Hasty three quarters of a length away in third place. Jack Joel chose not to escort his filly to the winner's enclosure, and a stable lad led in the winner amid what was described as a \\"chilly silence\\". Glass Doll's winning time of 2:42.0 was two seconds faster than that recorded by Orby in winning the Epsom over the same course and distance two days previously. At Royal Ascot later in June Glass Doll was dropped back in distance for the Coronation Stakes over one mile but was beaten into third place by Frugality and Laomedia. She carried a seven- pound weight penalty in the race and was not expected to win. Shortly after her Oaks win Glass Doll had been covered by the stallion Bill of Portland and then by Sundridge. She did not conceive, however and returned to the racetrack. At Doncaster Racecourse in September Glass Doll was matched against colts in the St Leger but, despite attracting some support in the betting market, she made no impact and finished unplaced behind Wool Winder. Glass Doll ended the season with earnings of ¬£4,950. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Glass Doll a \\"poor\\" winner of the Oaks. Breeding record At the end of her racing career Glass Doll was retired to become a broodmare for Joel's stud. She produced at least five foals between 1910 and 1917: *My Dolly, a bay filly, foaled in 1910, sired by Sundridge *Dolly Varden, bay filly, 1911, by Sundridge *Broken Doll, bay filly, 1913, by Sunder *Dolly, brown filly, 1915, by Sunstar *Ocean Light, brown filly, 1917, by Sunstar. Female-line ancestor of Moon Ballad, Braashee (Prix Royal-Oak) and Central Park (Italian Derby). Glass Doll died in 1922. Pedigree Glass Doll was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Lord Clifden, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of her pedigree. She was also inbred 4 √ó 4 to Stockwell.

Principally a cookbook, it also provided advice to housewives on health, hygiene and economics. The work was based on the classes she gave to her students while headmistress of the girls college at Ytri-Ey near Skagastr√∂nd in the north of Iceland. Early life and education Born on 19 October 1856 at Espih√≥li on the Eyjafj√∂r√∞ur, El√≠n Rannveig Briem Eiriksd√≥ttir was the daughter of Eggerts Gunnlaugson Briem, the sheriff of Skagfir√∞ingar, and his wife Ingibj√∂rg Eir√≠ksd√≥ttir. She was the 10th in a family of 19 children. The family moved frequently, settling in Reynistathar in 1872. There the children were taught privately at home, learning all the normal subjects as well as English, Danish and German. El√≠n and her sister Kristin strongly supported the establishment of the first girls' school for the north of Iceland. It opened in 1877 in Skagafj√∂r√∞ur. Career After teaching at the Skagafj√∂r√∞ur School for some time, El√≠n went to Denmark in 1881 to train as a teacher at Natalie Zahle's School in Copenhagen. On graduating in 1883, she returned to Iceland to head the newly formed women's school at Ytri Ey. She stayed there under 1895, initially with 20 students but numbers grew rapidly attracting girls from throughout the country. In addition to the principal, there were two other teachers. The subjects taught were writing, arithmetic, geography, Danish, English, history and cookery. On 1 June 1895, El√≠n married S√¶mund Eyj√≥lfsson, a farmer who had studied theology and was also a prolific writer. They moved together to Reykjavik but he died less than a year later. After his death, she moved back to her old Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur school. She soon met one of her old childhood friends, Stef√°n J√≥nsson, who had become a shopkeeper. They married in May 1903, after which El√≠n became known as El√≠n J√≥nsson. The marriage did not last very long as Stef√°n died on 5 May 1910. El√≠n once again took on the role of headmistress in 1912 but had to retire in 1915 as her health deteriorated. She spent the remainder of her life in Reykjavik. Although she had no children of her own, she had a foster son, S√¶mund Helgason, who worked for the post office. Cookbook In her spare time, El√≠n wrote Kvennafr√¶√∞arinn, first published in 1888. The 3,000 copies from the first edition were soon sold out, leading to three further editions in 1891, 1904 and 1911. While three-quarters of the book presented recipes, it also contained advice for housewives on nutrition, hygiene, cleaning and even economics. As a result, the book proved to have considerable impact on Icelandic cooking and housekeeping. The book is considered to be one of the most extensively published in Iceland. Later life Throughout her life, El√≠n contributed to improvements in education, housekeeping and healthy living. For her achievements, she received the Order of the Falcon. In later years, she continued to write. She died in Reykjavik on 4 December 1937.

Established in 1977, it is dedicated to illustrating the philosophy of Bhagavad-gita and is owned and operated by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). History \\"The Precarious Condition of the Living Entity\\" diorama The Bhagavad-gita Museum was inspired by a diorama exhibit developed by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati in the mid 1930s, consisting of dozens of dioramas dedicated to the philosophy of Krishna consciousness. In 1973 Sarasvati's student A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), also known as the Hare Krishna movement, sent a group of disciples from the New York temple to Mayapur, India, to study the art of diorama doll making. After fifteen months of studying the team returned and the construction of the dolls in the Los Angeles site began, the museum finally opening in 1977. The museum is located in West Los Angeles near the border of Culver City, where a sizable Hare Krishna population resides. For the time, the museum was quite sophisticated: a computer was specially designed to synchronize the exhibition which included lighting, a 16-track sound system, numerous film and slide projectors, and special visual effects. New industrial grade projectors and new lighting effects were installed in 1984. However, this sophistication came with a price, and the exhibit was plagued by computer glitches and maintenance problems falling into significant disrepair by 1995. Starting in 1999 the museum was refurbished, and was reopened in 2001 with modern solid state show controls. Further renovations were made in the 2010s and the museum was reopened in 2016. Exhibits thumb The exhibit consists of eleven dioramas. The almost life-sized dolls in the dioramas are constructed from traditional Indian doll-making materials such as bamboo, rice straw, various clays, and rice husk, using traditional construction, finishing, and dressing techniques. While the display was refurbished over the years, it was not modernized. The dioramas are: * \\"Introduction ‚Äî Prabhupada and the Bhagavad-gita\\" * \\"Setting the Stage\\" * \\"Changing Bodies\\" * \\"The Precarious Condition of the Living Entity\\" * \\"Choices on the Path of Life\\" * \\"Equal Vision of the Sages\\" * \\"Krishna's Transcendental Manifestations\\" * \\"God's Universal Form\\" * \\"The Ocean of Birth and Death\\" * \\"Lord Chaitanya's Sankirtan Festival\\" * \\"Goloka ‚Äî The Spiritual Realm\\" Other amenities The museum is adjacent to a restaurant serving vegetarian cuisine, and has a gift shop. Reception In 1977, the year of its opening, the museum received media attention due to a photograph by Eddie Adams of the \\"Changing Bodies\\" exhibit, which he photographed at Topanga Canyon against the backdrop of the Santa Monica Mountains. The picture appeared in more than a hundred newspapers and was featured in Associated Press' Yearbook 1977. It was selected by the National Press Photographers Association and Popular Photography for the 1978 American Photographic Artists (APA) International Exhibition of Photography. The museum was featured by LA Weekly in 2011 as one of the \\"Best of L.A. Arts & Entertainment\\" and in 2012 as one of \\"10 Oddball L.A. Museums Worth Seeing\\". In 2013 Deb Flomberg of CBS Los Angeles described it as \\"fascinating and educational\\" and \\"an important way to learn a lot about this greatly misunderstood religion\\".

After playing collegiate basketball for UC Berkeley and representing Taiwan in international basketball tournaments in the 1980s, he joined Costco and rose to the position of senior vice president and regional manager for Asia. Early life Chang was born in Taiwan in 1964, and moved to Southern California at the age of four with his family. He grew up in Huntington Beach and attended Edison High School, where he was a forward on the school basketball team and a teammate of Rick DiBernardo. His senior year, Chang was named to the All-CIF 4A first team, which also included Jay Bilas and Kerry Boagni. He also joined the track and field team, where he set the school's junior varsity men's high jump record of 6'6\\" in 1980. Basketball career Chang went on to the University of California, Berkeley on an NCAA scholarship from 1982 to 1986. He credits Golden Bears basketball coach Lou Campanelli for instilling a strong work ethic in him during those years. He did not play during the 1983‚Äì1984 season due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury. During his final season on the team in 1985-1986, Chang averaged 3.5 points per game, including one match in which he scored eight points against UCLA. He was the only Taiwan-born Division I player at the time. Later sources sometimes nicknamed him \\"the Jeremy Lin of the 1980s\\". Chang was invited to Taiwan in 1985 to play for the Chinese Taipei men's national basketball team, as a member of which he led the team to victory over the Japanese and South Korean teams in the 1985 and 1988 William Jones Cups. He also played semi-professionally in Taiwan for McDonald's (now Pauian Archiland Basketball Team) while holding down a day job at a trading company, but quit after less than three years because he found that the league was insufficiently competitive and that he no longer enjoyed playing basketball as a result. Business After retiring from basketball, Chang moved back to the United States, and then worked briefly in Southeast Asia for a US company. In 1995 he returned to Taiwan in order to set up a local subsidiary of Costco. His height and large build continued to serve him well in business. On one occasion, Chang was seated next to Chinatrust Commercial Bank executive on a flight. Koo, himself taller than average, was impressed to meet someone so much bigger than himself, and struck up a conversation with Chang to ask whether he played basketball. This chance acquaintance paved the way for Costco Taiwan to offer a promotional credit card with Chinatrust. In August 2015, Chang was promoted to senior vice president of Costco for the Asia region. Other activities Chang is involved with efforts to help local basketball players develop other careers after retirement. He is also the president of the Berkeley Club of Taiwan. His Chinese-language self-help book Coaching Yourself was published in July 2017 by Reading Times. He enjoys swimming, and wakes up early most mornings to go to the pool before work. Chang is married and has two sons. He is a cousin of physicist Stephen Hsu.

Description from Seitz M. iduna Dalm. (= maturna Hbn.) (65b). This butterfly represents the preceding species [ Euphydryas maturna] in the high north of Europe and in the mountains of Northern Asia. Male and female not essentially different. All the spots of the central area are ivory yellow above, with the exception of the cell, which contains 2 red-brown spots on the forewing and one on the hindwing. The underside similar to that of cynthia, but the pale yellow median and marginal bands much broader, the former moreover not being divided by a black line as is the case in maturna and cynthia. In Lapponia, Central and North-East Siberia, not rare. Specimens from the Altai differ from European ones in the stronger silvery gloss of the light markings, especially beneath. In ab. sulitelmica Schultz (65b) the light median band is narrower and the hindwing above is dusted with black. ‚Äî The species flies early in July in abundance on barren alpine meadows at altitudes from 6‚Äì8000 ft. in company witii aurinia and cinxia.Seitz, A. ed.
