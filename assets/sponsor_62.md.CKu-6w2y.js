It is assumed that these pieces have been implemented correctly, hence no correctness verification of these pieces is needed.

History  Automatic program synthesis began in the artificial intelligence field, with software intended for automatic problem solving. The first program synthesizer was developed by Cordell Green in 1969.Green, Cordell (1969) Application of Theorem Proving to Problem Solving. Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Donald E. Walker and Lewis M. Norton, editors, Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, New York, New York, 219‚Äì239. At about the same time, mathematicians including R. Constable, Z. Manna, and R. Waldinger explained the possible use of formal logic for automatic program synthesis. Practically applicable program synthesizers appeared considerably later. The idea of structural synthesis of programs was introduced at a conference on algorithms in modern mathematics and computer science Tyugu, E.H. (1981). The structural synthesis of programs. In: Algorithms in Modern Mathematics and Computer Science : Proceedings, Urgench, Uzbek SSR September 16‚Äì22, 1979: Ershov, A.P.; Knuth, D.E. (Eds.) Berlin: Springer, 1981 (Lecture Notes in Computer Science; 122), 290 - 303. organized by Andrey Ershov and Donald Knuth in 1979. The idea originated from G. P√≥lya‚Äôs well-known book on problem solving.P√≥lya, G. (1957) How to solve it. Princeton University Press. The method for devising a plan for solving a problem in SSP was presented as a formal system. The inference rules of the system were restructured and justified in logic by G. Mints and E. Tyugu Mints, G.; Tyugu, E. (1982). Justification of the structural synthesis of programs. Science of Computer Programming, 2(3), 215 - 240. in 1982. A programming tool PRIZ Mints, G.; Tyugu, E. (1988). The programming system PRIZ. Journal of Symbolic Computation, 5(3), 359 - 375. that uses SSP was developed in the 1980s. A recent Integrated development environment that supports SSP is CoCoViLa http://www.cs.ioc.ee/cocovila -- a model-based software development platform for implementing domain specific languages and developing large Java programs.  The logic of SSP  Structural synthesis of programs is a method for composing programs from already implemented components (e.g. from computer commands or software object methods) that can be considered as functions. A specification for synthesis is given in intuitionistic propositional logic by writing axioms about the applicability of functions. An axiom about the applicability of a function f is a logical implication :X1 ‚àß X2 ‚àß ... ‚àß Xm ‚Üí Y1 ‚àß Y2 ... Yn, where X1, X2, ... Xm are preconditions and Y1, Y2, ... Yn are postconditions of the application of the function f. In intuitionistic logic, the function f is called a realization of this formula. A precondition can be a proposition stating that input data exists, e.g. Xi may have the meaning ‚Äúvariable xi has received a value‚Äù, but it may denote also some other condition, e.g. that resources needed for using the function f are available, etc. A precondition may also be an implication of the same form as the axiom given above; then it is called a subtask. A subtask denotes a function that must be available as an input when the function f is applied. This function itself must be synthesized in the process of SSP. In this case, realization of the axiom is a higher order function, i.e., a function that uses another function as an input. For instance, the formula :(state ‚Üí nextState) ‚àß initialState ‚Üí result can specify a higher order function with two inputs and an output result. The first input is a function that has to be synthesized for computing nextState from state, and the second input is initialState. Higher order functions give generality to the SSP ‚Äì any control structure needed in a synthesized program can be preprogrammed and used then automatically with a respective specification. In particular, the last axiom presented here is a specification of a complex program ‚Äì a simulation engine for simulating dynamic systems on models where nextState can be computed from state of the system.

She was tortured and killed by the civic-military dictatorship that ruled between 1973 and 1985.  Biography  The daughter of a textile worker at the Campomar y Soulas factory in Juan Lacaze, Sabalsagaray was recognized by classmates and professors alike as a brilliant student. Professor Omar Moreira recalled that \\"she was so brilliant that, when a teacher was needed for a fourth-year [sophomore] class, the high school principal asked me for a name for the position and I told him that for me Nibia was the ideal person, except there was an issue; she wasn't yet 18, which meant that the Secondary Education Council gave her special permission and she became a literature teacher in Colonia Valdense at the age of 17\\". In 1968, she began studying Literature at the Artigas Teachers' Institute (IPA) in Montevideo where she stood out for her intelligence, creativity and social engagement. She was part of the labor-union group Renovation of the IPA Student Center (CEIPA) and joined the Union of Communist Youth (UJC) of Uruguay. On June 24, 1974 at 2:00 am, she was arrested at her home and taken to Battalion No. 5 in Montevideo; at midday, her family was informed of her death, classed as a suicide, and was delivered her coffin with the express prohibition to open it. The family did not respect that prohibition and Marcos Car√°mbula, a student of medicine six months from becoming a doctor, found multiple marks of torture on the body, and that the marks on her neck could not have been self-inflicted. On September 8, 2004, her sister, Blanca Estela SabalsagarayVariously referred to as Blanca, Estela, Blanca Stella and Blanca Stela., filed a legal complaint demanding an investigation into the circumstances of Nibia‚Äôs death. In 2005, the government of President Tabar√© V√°zquez placed the death of Nibia Sabalsagaray outside the reach of the Expiry Law because civilians had participated in her detention, according to the presentation her sister had made in court. The government's resolution was based on the principle that civilians are not covered by the Expiry Law, which only mentions \\"military and police personnel, equivalents and assimilated personnel\\". In 2005, a street was named in tribute to her in her hometown of Nueva Helvecia. On October 19, 2009, the Uruguayan Supreme Court unanimously declared the application of the Expiry Law in the case of Nibia Sabalsagaray to be unconstitutional. The judges justified the measure by arguing that the norm violated the separation of powers and that it could not be understood as an amnesty law since it was not approved according to the regulations in the Constitution. On November 8, 2010, Judge Rolando Vomero charged General Miguel Dalmao and retired colonel Jos√© Chialanza with highly aggravated homicide over the death of Nibia Sabalsagaray.

History The registration of the Derby Tramways Company took place in October 1877. In November 1879 it was reported that navvies were laying down the tracks in London Road. The innovation was not welcomed by all the residents of the town.

The initial service was provided with four tramcars, each hauled by one horse, except for the stretch along St Peter‚Äôs Street where an additional horse was attached. The horses had bells attached to their collars. The first line opened on 6 March 1880 from the Market Place along St. Peter's Street to Midland Railway station. Further lines on Osmaston Road and Friar Gate lines had a total length of about two and a half miles. The lines were laid by Messrs. Mousley & Co.The builder. 1880 The Ashbourne road extension was opened on 1 October 1880, and the Osmaston extension was opened on 8 October 1880. At their General Meeting in 1881, the company reported that total receipts from 6 March to 31 December 1880 were ¬£4,924 12s 1d (), with expenditure of ¬£3,575 2s 11d (), leaving a profit of ¬£1,349 9s 2d (). They had carried 470,547 passengers, on tramway along 3 miles, 1 furlong, 5 chains of streets. There were two depots, one adjoining the arches of the Great Northern Railway which accommodated 87 horses and 21 cars, and the other near the Midland Railway station which accommodated 20 horses and 5 cars. The total fleet was 69 horses, 12 cars, and 8 omnibuses. The directors considered a petition from 6,000 residents of Derby objecting to running on Sunday, but decided not to suspend Sunday services. The fourth extension of the tramway from the Royal Hotel along Normanton Road to the Normanton Hotel was opened on 27 May 1881. In June 1881 the company provided an extension to serve the Royal Agricultural Show. The Normanton and Osmanton extensions provided disappointing financially, and at the General Meeting in 1882 the Directors had resolved to resist calls to extend the tramway along the Uttoxeter Road, and the powers had lapsed. The directors experimented with reducing fares from 2d () to 1.5d (). The receipts for 1881 were ¬£8,254 8s 4d (), with expenses of ¬£6,866 19s 10d (). The number of passengers carried was 907,892.

Gert Ledig Biography Gert Ledig, son of a merchant, spent his early childhood in Vienna. From 1929 he lived in Leipzig. After finishing school, he held down a number of casual jobs from 1936 onwards. After this, he entered an apprenticeship to become an electrician and also studied at a private acting school to become a director. In 1939, he volunteered for the German army (Wehrmacht). As a pioneer, he took part in fighting at the Western Front, advanced to NCO and was transferred to the Eastern Front in 1941. Due to alleged misconduct he was transferred to a penal battalion. In summer 1942, Ledig was wounded before Leningrad; he suffered, among other injuries, an injury to his jaw. After being released from the army, he trained to become a shipbuilding engineer. In the last year of the war he worked in the naval forces bureaucracy. After the end of the Second World War, Ledig joined Germany's Communist Party. He again worked several casual jobs, such as lumberjack and scaffolder. In 1948, he failed in his attempt to take over his father's company and also failed in setting up his own advertising agency. From 1951 to 1953, Ledig worked as a translator for the US Army, then worked as an author from 1953 onwards. His debut novel The Stalin Organ (Die Stalinorgel) was relatively positively received both in Germany and abroad. Ledig was invited to meetings of Germany's literary author group Gruppe 47. Because of his war injuries and doubts whether he could call himself an author at all, he declined the invitation, stating he'd find it impossible to stand next to authors such as Ilse Aichinger, a member of the group, and Die Stalinorgel was \\"only a combat organ\\". In 1956, he was represented by G√ºnter Eich, who read from Ledig's second novel, Vergeltung (Payback). Ledig's stark depiction of war events was increasingly met with revulsion in the climate of the 1950s, so Ledig eventually withdrew from writing altogether.Gert Ledig, Oktober 1963 From 1963 he ran an engineering firm and an agency for technology news. Ledig, meanwhile living in isolation in Utting near the Ammersee, was only rediscovered in 1998 - just before his death. W. G. Sebald had been pointed towards his work Vergeltung as one of the few examples of a literary treatment of Allied air raids on Germany during the Second World War. Sebald published a chapter on the responses to his Z√ºrcher Vorlesungen (\\"Zurich lectures\\") of 1997 and the resulting discussion in the Germany media in his book On the Natural History of Destruction (\\"Luftkrieg und Literatur\\") in 1999. In autumn 1999, German publisher Suhrkamp re-issued Vergeltung, which met much more positive responses now than during its first publication in autumn 1956. In August 1999, the novel was discussed in the Literarisches Quartett, a TV-broadcast book discussion featuring prominent literature critics, discussed by Marcel Reich-Ranicki and thus gained recognition again.Volker Hage, Artikel, in: http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/interview-mit-marcel-reich-ranicki- die-literatur-ist-dazu-da-das-leiden-der-menschen-zu-zeigen-a-258376.html.

At a flat coast or flat shoreline, the land descends gradually into the sea. Flat coasts can be formed either as a result of the sea advancing into gently-sloping terrain or through the abrasion of loose rock. They may be basically divided into two parallel strips: the shoreface and the beach. Flat coasts consist of loose material such as sand and gravel. Wind transports finer grains of sand inland over the dunes. The sea washes pebbles and sand away from the coast and dumps it at other locations.  Flat coast littoral series  Diagram of a flat coast littoral series. Key: B: bar, TNW: average low tide, THW: average high tide, US: shoreface; GS: foreshore, SW: berm, SR: runnel, HS: backshore, DG: dune belt, SK: dune cliff The typical sequence of landforms created by the sea is described as a \\"littoral series\\". = Sandbars, runnels and creeks = Wadden creek with exposed sandbar during an ebb tide The littoral series of a flat coast starts in the permanently flooded shallow water region, or shoreface, with a sand or gravel reef (also called a bar). The longshore bar is an elongated ridge of sand found parallel to the shore in the surf zone on many flat coasts. It consists mainly of sand or gravel, depending on the material available along the coast. The sides of the sandbar fall gently away. The basin between a sandbar and the shore zone is called the runnel or swale. The presence of a bar clearly indicates that the movement of waves is transporting and depositing material on the seabed. There may be several bars whose longitudinal axes all run parallel to the beach and which are separated by equally parallel runnels or creeks. The drainage troughs in areas of tidal flats also run parallel to the coast. = Shoreface and beach = Start of the dune belt by the sand cliff The shoreface (or underwater platform) on flat coasts encompasses in its narrow sense that area which is subject to the constant action of moving water. This means that the landward boundary between shoreface and beach is the line of the average low-water mark. However this definition is not universal and frequently varies from author to author in the literature. Whilst some define the beach as the landward transition to the shoreface that extends from the low-water mark to the highest high-water mark, i.e. the zone that is only periodically or episodically (after a storm surge) flooded by water; other authors do not use the term \\"beach\\" for the landward element of a flat coast at all. They describe the region between the mean low- water mark and the mean high-water mark of the tides as the intertidal zone or foreshore and that area above the average high-water mark as the supratidal zone or backshore that is only directly attacked by water during storms. Because the backshore is often considerably flatter in appearance than the foreshore, which slopes clearly down towards the sea, it is also often referred to as a beach platform, which is why this part of the shore can be considered in practice to be the actual beach. The farthest point inland that is reached by storm surges is bounded by a belt of dunes, where floods can form a dune cliff. = Berm = The berm: where the gravel is no longer washed back into the sea by the backwash On the beach (the beach platform) there is very often a bank of sand or a gravel ridge parallel to the shoreline and a few tens of centimetres high, known as the berm. On its landward side there is often a shallow runnel. The berm is formed by material transported by the breaking waves that is thrown beyond the average level of the sea. The coarse- grained material that can no longer be washed away by the backwash remains behind. The location and size of the berm is subject to seasonal changes. For example, a winter berm that has been thrown up by storm surges in winter is usually much more prominent and higher up the beach than berms formed by summer high tides. A similar landform is a beach ridge.  Beach losses and gains  Beach losses after a hurricane Beaches are usually heavily eroded during storm surges and the beach profile steepened, whereas normal wave action on flat coasts tends to raise the beach. Not infrequently a whole series of parallel berms is formed, one behind the other. There is a consequent gradual increase in height with the result that, over time, the shoreline advances seawards. A striking example of land-forming system of berms is Skagen Odde on the northern tip of Vendsyssel in the extreme north of Denmark. This headland is still growing today as more berms are added. Coastal defences against erosion are groynes, stone walls, or tetrapods of concrete, which act as breakwaters. The first plants to colonise the dunes include sea buckthorn or beach grass which prevent wind erosion.  References   Literature  * Klaus Duphorn et al.: Die deutsche Ostseek√ºste.

Early life  The son of the couple formed by the famous Chilean poet Jorge H√ºbner Bezanilla (impossible love of Gabriela Mistral) and Ofelia Gallo Schiavetti, H√ºbner Gallo, after studying in Europe and at the San Ignacio School, went on to study philosophy at the Pedagogical and Law Institute of the University of Chile's Law School, where he was a professor until the day of his death. For a long time he also taught at the Barros Arana National Boarding School. Of conservative opinion, he joined the Conservative Party and later the National Party. He received his doctorate in 1950 under the direction of Jos√© Ortega y Gasset.  Career  As a student, he was elected president of the University of Chile Student Federation in 1946. He served as a deputy for the district of Santiago Centro from 1961 to 1965, and directed the Library of the National Congress of Chile from 1975 until the return of democracy in 1990. During the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, he served as an advisor to the State Defense Council and advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During his period as Director of the Library of the National Congress of Chile, the Legal and Legislative Data Bank was designed and put into operation. This meant the automation of several functions of the Library, which expanded and expedited its consultation, reference and research services. But in this field there was still much to be done. Thus, in 1990 with the restoration of democracy, the National Congress reopened its sessions in the new institutional building in Valparaiso. He was a member of the board of directors of the National Publisher Gabriela Mistral. Editor of El Estanquero and El Diario Ilustrado. Correspondent of the newspaper ABC de Madrid and representative of ABC de las Am√©ricas. He was a member of the Legislative Commission I, of the Governing Board between January 4, 1976, and March 30, 1981. He was also a member of the First Legislative Commission on the Constitution, Economy, Development and Reconstruction, Finance and Mining, from April 1, 1981, to 1989. In addition, he was a founding member of the Chilean Association of Journalists, as well as of the Board of Trustees of the Chilean Institute of Hispanic Culture and the Chilean Society of Philosophy and its president in 1974.

The effect was first proposed in 2003 and experimentally confirmed in 2006 by the group of Prof. Peter Schattschneider at the Vienna University of Technology. Similarly to XMCD, EMCD is a difference spectrum of two EELS spectra taken in a magnetic field with opposite helicities. Under appropriate scattering conditions virtual photons with specific circular polarizations can be absorbed, giving rise to spectral differences. The largest difference is expected between the case where one virtual photon with left circular polarization and one with right circular polarization are absorbed. By closely analyzing the difference in the EMCD spectrum, information can be obtained on the magnetic properties of the atom, such as its spin and orbital magnetic moment. In the case of transition metals such as iron, cobalt, and nickel, the absorption spectra for EMCD are usually measured at the L-edge. This corresponds to the excitation of a 2p electron to a 3d state by the absorption of a virtual photon providing the ionisation energy. The absorption is visible as a spectral feature in the electron energy loss spectrum (EELS). Because the 3d electron states are the origin of the magnetic properties of the elements, the spectra contain information on the magnetic properties. Moreover, since the energy of each transition depends on the atomic number, the information obtained is element specific, that is, it is possible to distinguish the magnetic properties of a given element by examining the EMCD spectrum at its characteristic energy (708 eV for iron). Since in both EMCD and XMCD the same electronic transitions are probed, the information obtained is the same. However EMCD has a higher spatial resolution and depth sensitivity than its X-ray counterpart. Moreover, EMCD can be measured on any TEM equipped with an EELS detector, whereas XMCD is normally measured only on dedicated synchrotron beamlines. A disadvantage of EMCD in its original incarnation is its requirement of crystalline materials with a thickness and orientation that just precisely gives the correct 90 degree phase shift needed for EMCD. However, a new method has recently demonstrated that electron vortex beams can also be used to measure EMCD without the geometrical constraints of the original procedure.

The stations and bicycles were owned by the government and operated in a public-private partnership with RACV. Launched in 2010, the network utilized a system designed by Montreal- based PBSC Urban Solutions with 600 bicycles operating from 51 stations. Melbourne Bike Share was one of two such systems in Australia until the Victorian Government shut down the service on 30 November 2019. Initially Melbourne Bike Share experienced low ridership. , users had made about 13,000 trips each month, short of the goal of 25,000 trips per month. A mandatory helmet law was cited as reason. In November 2010, the Victoria state government began offering helmet rentals at selected stations in an attempt to increase both ridership and helmet usage. The Victorian Government decided in May 2013 to trial free helmet sharing by attaching the helmets to the handlebars of a portion of the bike share fleet. The service offered a variety of daily, weekly and annual passes as well as a pay-as-you-go option. RACV reported in their Annual Report that 170,000 rides took place between July 2015 and June 2016. History Melbourne's MBS and CityCycle in Brisbane were, until the introduction of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada's bike- sharing service, some of the few schemes in the world that attempt to operate under a mandatory helmet requirement. A bicycle helmets vending machine in The University of Melbourne Parkville campus, Australia Implementation and planning costs totalled A$5.5 million over four years, which required a usage rate of 500 trips per day, or 15,000 per month, for the scheme to break-even. During the first week of operation, the system was used only 253 times. This use rate dropped to only 136 times per day by October 2010, for a total of 20,700 trips, with nearly 650 subscribers. The low popularity of the scheme in comparison to other cities was attributed to Melbourne's mandatory helmet laws, acknowledged by the government, which recently began subsidising helmet purchases at $5 per helmet from local convenience stores and vending machines. The helmet subsidy added an additional A$5 million to the cost of the bike share programme. After the introduction of subsidised helmets, MBS bicycle usage rate increased to 183 trips per day. This usage rate increased to 283 trips per day (8,500 trips per month) in December 2010, with another increase to 433 trips per day (13,000 per month) by May 2011. Promotional efforts to advertise MBS have been limited, though mobile phone optimised websites have also been created, such as BikeShare.Tel, allowing users to locate stations and see bike availability. MELTours launched a bicycle tour based on the MBS within a month of launch as a way to enable tourists to see the city using the MBS and to learn how to use it. The tour was designed around the available MBS pods where each leg is no more than 30 minutes in duration, making the cost to the customer as low as possible while still allowing a two-hour activity.  Technology  The platform behind the bike share system was created by 8D Technologies, who also supply the server technology for BIXI Montr√©al, Citi Bike in New York City, Santander Cycles in London, Capital Bikeshare in Washington DC, and others.

This took place in the context of the Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905‚Äì1907), and represented one of the biggest actions in the history of OB PPS. Events The aim of OB PPS was to stop repressions following in the wake of the revolution, and demonstrate its strength to the Russian government. It organized a series of simultaneous attacks on Russian officials, primarily policemen, in the Russian partition of Poland that occurred on August 15, 1906. There were about 100 incidents, with attacks reported in 18, 19 or 20 cities and towns. Sources vary significantly with regards to the number of fatalities, reporting about 80, 70, 51, 29 or 19 fatalities among Russian officials (primarily policeman) and informants (see Okhrana), and 43 or 69 injured. In Warsaw alone, sources note \\"over 100 civilian casualties\\", another notes 50 Russian policemen killed and 100 wounded, yet another talks of about 200 fatalities. There, an OB PPS group led by Henryk Baron attacked police offices and clashed with a Cossack military unit, which led to a panic in the Russian garrison, suspecting an uprising, and the retreat of some military units from the town. There was also a demonstration at Grzybowski Square. Another large assault took place in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, where a 25-strong OB PPS group under F. Lipi≈Ñski attacked a police station, and ambushed several patrols. Aftermath Three days later, on 18 August 1906, OB PPS carried out another of its landmark operations, when OB PPS female activist Wanda Krahelska-Filipowicz attempted to assassinate the Russian Governor-general of Warsaw, Georgi Skalon, in Warsaw. OB PPS was not fully united behind this operation; it was notably opposed by J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. Other, more moderate organizations like Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania and Bund were also critical of this operation. The Russian response was a new wave of arrests and persecution of anti-state activists. The Imperial Russian Army terrorized worker districts in Warsaw, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and other towns; the most infamous of the reprisal actions was the Russian-organized Siedlce pogrom on 8‚Äì10 September 1906. Those events became among the best known actions of the OB PPS. They were also among the biggest terrorist-like events in the history of OB PPS. It also marked the high point of OB PPS activity, which would wind down over the next year or so.

A prominent member of Civic Union, he served as Defence Minister during the first years of Julio Mar√≠a Sanguinetti's first presidential term. Biography Chiarino graduated as a lawyer at the Law Faculty of the University of the Republic (Uruguay), was a militant of the Civic Union of the Catholic party and in the 1930s ran the newspaper \\"The Public Good\\" that diffusered ideas of the policy community. In 1944 he entered in the House of Representatives representing his party, after the Dardo Regules' resignation. In the 1946 elections Chiarino won a seat as an MP again. He was elected senator in the elections of 1950, and reelected in 1954, leaving the bench in 1959. In 1962, after consulting with a refreshing sector, Civic Union adopted the name of the Christian Democratic Party of Uruguay (PDC); Chiarino sided with the traditionalist group, and in 1965 walked away with the other new party and participated in the founding of the Christian Civic Movement (MCC), which was meager election results. In 1971, along with another PDC splinter group, led by Humberto Ciganda, co-founded the Radical Christian Union (URC) which also was successful in the elections of that year. On the occasion of the 1982 primaries, Chiarino reappeared on the public stage. Two years later, participate in discussions of the Park Hotel and the Naval Club Pact, turning points in the transition from Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay to democracy. Chiarino had a great respect and prestige of all sectors of the national political arena, made after the end of the transition to democracy in 1985 (in which he had ample participation), was appointed by President Julio Mar√≠a Sanguinetti, despite his advanced age, as head of the Ministry of National Defence. He was accompanied by his fellow undersecretary, Jose Maria Robaina Anso. From that position Chiarino had to face a troubled period in which there were many reports of violations of Human rights by the military dictatorship during this government. This created a tense atmosphere at the Armed Forces, and Chiarino culminated, after a virtual insubordination of the Army Commander Hugo Medina, facing military citations for justice, with the sanction of the Law on the Expiration of the Punitive Claims of the State, in December 1986, which prevented the continuation of the legal proceedings related to this issue. Chiarino left office in November 1987 and was replaced precisely by Medina.

During the most productive part of her public career, much of which coincided with the Second World War, she lived in France. Soca also founded and for many years produced the transatlantic literary journal La Licorne. Both in her journal and elsewhere she was notable for the extent and effectiveness of her support for fellow writers from Latin America and Europe. Daniel Balderston: Soca, Susana. In: Encyclopedia of Latin American and Caribbean Literature 1900-2003. Routledge 2004, , p. 543 She died near Rio de Janeiro airport when the Lockheed airliner on which she was a passenger crashed, killing all 29 passengers and 7 of the 10 crew members. Biography =Provenance and early years= Susana Luisa Mar√≠a de las Mercedes Soca was born at her parents' home in Montevideo. She was baptised a few days before her second birthday at Notre-Dame (cathedral) in Paris during a family trip to Europe.Bill Marshall: The French Atlantic. Travels in Culture and History. Liverpool University Press 2009, , p. 287/288 Susana's father was not particularly religious but her mother was a deeply committed Roman Catholic. As a young man Francisco Soca had studied medicine in Paris, where he had successfully submitted his doctoral dissertation in 1888. Susana Soca was her parents' only recorded child. In a country with a relatively small ruling √©lite, the family into which she was born was rich and well connected. Francisco Soca's family came originally from the Canary Islands. He was a physician who for very many years held the chair of clinical medicine at the university, and who also involved himself increasingly in national politics. He enjoyed an excellent professional reputation among Montevideo's leading families, and it was during a house visit to treat the wife of Juan Carlos Blanco Fern√°ndez (1847-1910), Luisa Acevedo de Blanco that he met one of his patient's daughter, Luisa Blanco Acevedo. Despite a 26 year difference in their ages, Francisco Soca and Luisa Blanco Acevedo married in a civil ceremony at the Acevedo family home on the night of 5/6 April 1905. The religious ceremony was held in the cathedral the next day, and the couple then departed for a trip to Europe. The Acevedos were an old and large family. Through her mother's aristocratic connections Susana Soca grew up in Montevideo with many influential kinsfolk such as her uncle, the writer and Uruguayan senator Eduardo Acevedo D√≠az who had signed as a witness on her parents' marriage certificate. As a child Susana Soca frequently accompanied her father when he went to visit patients in their homes. Marta Behrens later told an interviewer how she remembered seeing a little girl sitting in the doctor's car outside the house when she went to visit her grandmother. Evidently the child was very interested in the old lady's illness because she came along with her father \\"every day\\". She never got out of the car, however, but remained in the back seat reading a book. Behrens remembered Soca, who must have been around twelve at the time, sitting in the car in the fading evening light with a face that \\"showed sadness\\". She was educated at home, always in French, by a succession of private tutors. The first of them was her mother's sister, Maruja Blanco, the wife of Julio Ra√∫l Mendilaharsu. Early on Susana Soca mastered various languages: Spanish, French, English, German, Latin, Italian, Greek and subsequently Russian. Probably around 1938 she met Boris Pasternak through mutual friends in Paris. Travel became difficult in Europe over the next few years, and much of their subsequent friendship was conducted by letter, as a result of which Soca was able greatly to improve her Russian. Soca played a part in concealing the manuscript of Doctor Zhivago (which had been refused publication in the Soviet Union), though the extent of her involvement remains contested. =Contacts= Family connections meant that even during her adolescence Susana Soca knew many leading contemporary Uruguayan writers. These included the poet-professors Mar√≠a Eugenia Vaz Ferreira and Orfila Bardesio, the poet-essayist Carlos Sabat Ercasty, the distinguished writer Jules Supervielle and the author Carlos Reyles. There were frequent visits to Paris, initially with her parents and then, as she grew older, on her own. In 1936 the Franco-Belgian polymath-writer Henri Michaux met Susana Soca, by now aged 30, in Argentina or Uruguay. Attraction was clearly mutual and an intense relationship ensued. In the end, however, Soca preferred to stay with her widowed mother, which at least one French language source links with the fact that she had inherited her mother's deep commitment to the church. In any event, there was no marriage. =A ten year trip to Paris= Towards the end of 1938 Susana Soca made one of her regular visits to Paris. She was accompanied by her mother. They stayed at the Plaza Ath√©n√©e (hotel). Later they took a suite at the Hotel George V. 1939 was a year of mounting international tension, especially in Europe, and by the time the women were ready to return to Uruguay the Second World War had broken out. They found themselves stuck in Paris. On 3 September 1939 France and Britain declared war on Nazi Germany: on the streets of Paris and London eerily little changed, as the governments in those cities waited to see what Chancellor Hitler would do next. The answer arrived on 10 May 1940 when the Geman army invaded and quickly overran the northern half of France. A month later they reached Paris, which was formally surrendered on 14 June 1940. The German high command installed themselves in the Hotel George V. It was necessary for hotel guests to find alternative accommodation. Soca and her mother moved to the Grand Ritz Hotel in the Place Vend√¥me at the city's heart. However, by now it was becoming clear that they would not be returning to Uruguay any tome soon, and they subsequently took an apartment in the affluent Passy quarter. Sources are largely silent as to how, in Paris, Susana Soca spent the war years themselves. It is clear that she began to write poetry in Spanish. As she would later explain in the foreword to her 1959 poetry collection \\"En un pa√≠s de la memoria\\", this provided a route by which she was able to find her personal identity and her homeland in the Spanish language. Sources also suggest that well before 1945 she was already working on plans for the launch and operation of her own literary journal. =La Licorne= After the war Susana Soca founded Cahiers de La Licorne (literally, \\"notebooks of the unicorn\\"), a French conceived transatlantic literary journal designed and presented as a twice yearly periodical-anthology. The first edition, published in Paris, appeared in March 1947. The cover featured a unicorn based drawing by Valentine Hugo which referenced the Monoceros (unicorn) constellation. Inside many of the various features also benefited from characteristically stylised illustrations by Hugo, who also contributed a number of pictures of Soca herself and of Luisa Blanco Acevedo de Soca, Susana's mother. A second edition appeared in December 1947 and a third in Autumn/Fall 1948. It provided a publication space for European authors who had been silent during the war or whose works had been overlooked. Some of the first French authors features were Paul √âluard, Maurice Blanchot, Roger Caillois, Ren√© Char, Ren√© Daumal and Jean Paulhan. Soca published literary texts, essays and poems from some of the twentieth century's most important writers and intellectuals. She also contributed numerous literary essays of her own, notably about European authors and artists. The focus was largely on timeless aspects of the arts, as far as possible set apart from political ideologies and involvement. There was also a cohort of Latin American writers, hitherto unknown in Europe, whose works were first introduced to European readers thanks to La Licorne. Susana Soca was simultaneously the publisher, producer, editor and backer for Silvina Ocampo, Felisberto Hern√°ndez and many others. However, towards the end of 1948 she left Paris and returned to Montevideo. Paris production of La Licorne ended. That was not the end of La Licorne, however. It was relaunched in Montevideo as \\"Entregas de la Licorne\\" in 1953, controlled as before, by Susana Soca, until her unexpected death in 1959. Now she was able to act as an intermediary between modern Latin American and European literary culture from the western side of the ocean. In Montevideo she attracted figures from the arts whose families had fled from Germany during the Hitler years such as the photographer Gis√®le Freund, whom she knew from her time in Paris, and the journalist Hellmut Freund who provided various contributions to Entregas de la Licorne, including an essay about the pioneering artist-photographer Jeanne Mandello who had arrived in Uruguay in 1941.J. Hellmut Freund: Arte foto- gr√°fica. Alrededor de la producci√≥n de Arno y Jeanne Mandello. In: Entregas de la Licorne, Montevideo 1953, pp. 165‚Äì174 She continued to undertake frequent trips to Europe. Back home in Montevideo she convened literary meetings at her home. She also organised and funded exhibitions that introduced European artists in Latin America, and acted as a sponsor for Uruguayan literary talents such as Felisberto Hern√°ndez. =Death= At the beginning of 1959 Susana Soca was in Paris when she received a call from her mother asking her to come home. At Paris she joined a Lufthansa flight to Rio de Janeiro. On 11 January, as Flight 502 approached Rio's Gale√£o airport in poor weather, the Lockheed L-1049 hit the water of Guanabara Bay before reaching the nearby airport runway. The pilot lost control and the plane burst into flames near Flecheiras Beach. The 29 passengers all died. In retrospect The full extent and importance of Soca's \\"behind the scenes\\" activities in literature and the arts during the 1940s and 1950s becomes apparent from literary anthologies, diaries and correspondence, much of which became available to scholars only after her death, for instance in the writings of Albert Camus and Emil Cioran, from pictures and photographs, and from the collected correspondence of others, such as Victoria Ocampo, Roger Caillois, Felisberto Hern√°ndez, Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez, Jos√© Bergam√≠n-Mar√≠a Zambrano. Pablo Picasso produced an oil-painting of Soca in the 1940s which he then sent to her: it is not clear where the portrait itself has ended up, but a photograph taken in Paris in 1943 by Andr√© Ostier shows her standing beside it. Gis√®le Freund produced numerous photographs of Susana Soca for Soca's long-term admirer Henri Michaux. Soca's poetry was largely confined to her diaries, however, and during her lifetime remained private. One of her first pieces of published work is the extended essay she wrote about Rainer Maria Rilke which appeared in the periodical \\"Alfar\\" in 1932. The first published compilation of her poetry appeared only in 1959. In truth and fiction In 2018 the Uruguayan novelist Claudia Amengual wrote El lugar inalcanzable, with a fictionalized Susana Soca facing a difficult life in Nazi-occupied Paris. Amegal had previously spent three years researching Susana Soca in Montevideo, Buenos Aires and Paris for a biography which appeared in 2012, and incorporated an analysis of Soca's poetic works and essays.

Bruce Humberstone and starring Victor Mature, Coleen Gray, Glenn Langan, and Reginald Gardiner. Plot Troops are massacred at a Furnace Creek fort in 1880 after an army captain, Walsh, cites orders forcing him to abandon a wagon train. Apache Indians hid inside the wagons to gain access to the fort. General Blackwell is blamed for the incident and court-martialed. Denying that he sent any such order, the general has a stroke and dies on the witness stand. No written evidence of the order is presented. One of his sons, Rufe, a captain from West Point, travels west to find out what happened. His brother, Cash, reads of their father's death in a Kansas City newspaper and also heads toward Furnace Creek in search of answers. Using an alias, Cash learns that Capt. Walsh has become a drunkard. A mining boss, Leverett, is impressed by the stranger in town and hires him, not knowing Cash's real name or intent. Rufe arrives in town and also assumes a false identity. Cafe waitress Molly Baxter, whose father was killed at the fort, still considers General Blackwell the man to blame. But the real villain is Leverett, who bribed Walsh and organized the Apache raid. A guilty conscience causes Walsh to write a confession. Leverett sends one of his henchmen to do away with Walsh, but the confession is found by Cash. Rufe is framed, arrested and tried, but escapes. Cash gives him the confession and tells him to take it to the Army as proof. Wounded in a gunfight with Leverett but victorious, Cash recovers and reads in the paper about the proof of General Blackwell's innocence.

Life Michel was born in the state of Colima to a wealthy and politically powerful family which owned large numbers of coconut palms, and supplied fruit to markets in Jalisco. He claimed to have been born in 1906 but his birth certificate says 1897. He had a sad childhood, with his parents separating after his father caught his mother with another man. He then took the children to live with him in Guadalajara. Five years later, Michel‚Äôs mother died and his father decided to adopt the three children born of her affair. This led to financial problems with their businesses on the point of bankruptcy. The situation was made worse with the death of his father. He has two major passions in his life: art and the sea, writing a detailed letter once to In√©s Amor, the owner of the prestigious Galer√≠a de Arte Mexicano about both. He began drawing in childhood, moving onto painting in his late teens. However, his formal schooling was intermittent, ending at age fifteen. In 1922, his parents sent him to San Francisco where he took classes in painting and worked at a studio used by various painters. When he returned to Mexico, he associated himself with a group of artists that included Jes√∫s Reyes Ferreira, Juan Soriano, Oliviero and Ricardo Martinez and Jes√∫s Guerrero Galv√°n. He was also associated with painters such as Rufino Tamayo, Manuel Rodr√≠guez Lozano, Roberto Montenegro and Agust√≠n Lazo, but he considered them ‚Äúpast their prime‚Äù and preferred the younger generations of artists. His love of the sea extended into travel, with his first trip to Europe in 1916 along with his family. Later in his life he also traveled to places such as Buenos Aires, Paris, Berlin and Monte Carlo, living in Montparnasse neighborhood of Paris for a couple of years starting in 1924 with Agust√≠n Lazo to study art. In this endeavor, he supported by his brother Jorge, but Michel lived vicariously, making restaurant menus and selling even his most meager possessions to survive, living in a hotel room with three young Spaniards and no heating. His last trip to Europe was touring France, Spain and Italy between 1949 and 1951. His time in Europe exposed him to the bohemian lifestyle, which he adopted and became known for. He was a fanciful and eccentric person, brown from time in the sun, carrying belongings in a bag and a string of pendants around his neck. His life remained economically and artistically unstable until the mid 1930s because of the lack of money or health issues, especially a tumor on his neck. Michel‚Äôs closest friends among Mexican painters during his lifetime included Juan Soriano, Manuel and Lola Alvarez Bravo, and Rufino and Olga Tamayo. Michel spent much of his life in frail health and died in 1957 while planning a return to France, dying instead in the French Hospital in Mexico City. Career When Michel returned to Mexico from Europe in 1930, he began his art career, painting a mural at the Sal√≥n de Artes Pl√°sticas at the Universidad de Guadalajara in 1932. However, shortly after to work as an extra in a film then and returned to his family‚Äôs hacienda in Colima. In 1936 he met In√©s Amor, who encouraged him to have a more formal attitude towards his profession. In 1942, he returned to his vocation, moving to Mexico City to paint. He held his first individual show shortly thereafter at the age of 45, with the Galer√≠a de Arte Mexicano. He also appeared at an important collective show called Mexican Painting at the Knoedler Gallery in New York in 1946. His most active period as an artist was from this time until his death in 1957; however, the interruption of his career and his health kept his production down to only about 100 pieces. Despite this, Michel is the most important artist from the state of Colima, according to the University of Colima . He was an early member of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. Long after his death, the Museo de Arte Moderno held a retrospective and tribute to the artist in 1991, assembling the largest collection of his works for a showing. The University of Colima established a pinacotheca named after the artist called the Pinacoteca Universitaria Alfonso Michel, located in the center of the Colima, Colima city of Colima in a complex of former mansions. It was established in 1996 and has a collection of over 1,000 works by artists such as Rafael Coronel, Carlos M√©rida, Jos√© Luis Cuevas, Sof√≠a Bassi, Alberto Gironella, Federico Cant√∫, Marcos Huerta and Juan Manuel de la Rosa along with other Colima artists such as Gabriel de la Mora, Rafael Mesina, Gil Garea, Jorge Ch√°vez Carrilo and Gabriel Portillo del Toro. His home state established the Alfonso Michel Cultural Festival which takes place in October in various locations in the state, particularly the city of Colima, Armer√≠a, Coquimatl√°n and Manzanillo . Guadalajara holds a biennial named after the painter as well, the Bienal de Pintura de Occidente Alfonso Michel at the former monastery of Del Carmen. Artistry Michel traveled in Europe in the 1920s, living in Paris to study art. However he did not find a teacher he was particularly drawn to. Instead, he worked developed as his reinterpretation of the artistic language of the European vanguard movement of the time. His pictorial style was influenced by C√©zanne and Picasso in his neo-Classical period. He was also interested in Braque and the metaphysical painting of De Chirico and Alberto Savinio . His themes include landscapes of the Colima shoreline and a number of portraits. Many of his works express introspection, nostalgia and pain. He had two periods of activities which that stretching from 1942 until his death being the most mature of his work. The composition of his work is grandiose, almost Baroque, accented with bright contrasting colors. Generationally, Michel was contemporary with the artists of Mexican muralism with its nationalist art. However, Michel did not participate in this movement and was frequently disparage for being ‚Äútoo European.‚Äù Nonetheless, his work was defended by art critics such as Jorge Juan Crespo, Margarita Nelken and writer Carlos Monsiv√°is . Tamayo called Michel one of the best painters in Mexico. Michel‚Äôs artistic ideas came after his return to Mexico from France, studying the work of Diego Rivera, Mar√≠a Izquierdo, Rufino Tamayo, Agust√≠n Lazo, C√©zanne, Picasso and Chirico among others. In particular the work of Tamayo unsettled him along with that of Picasso. His unique style for the time made him a forerunner to the Generaci√≥n de la Ruptura, which reached its peak in the 1960s.

For the English footpath see Viking Way. The Viking Way: Religion and War in Late Iron Age Scandinavia is an archaeological study of Norse paganism in Late Iron Age Scandinavia. It was written by the English archaeologist Neil Price, then a professor at the University of Aberdeen, and first published by the Department of Archaeology and Ancient History at Uppsala University in 2002. A revised second edition is due to be published in 2017 by Oxbow Books. Price had worked on the subject of Norse paganism for his doctoral thesis, undertaken between 1988 and 2002, first at the University of York, England and then at the University of Uppsala, Sweden. Although primarily archaeological, Price took an interdisciplinary approach to the subject, drawing evidence from other disciplines such as history and anthropology. Divided into seven chapters, Price opened the book with a discussion of his theoretical approach, before providing an overview of what is known of pre-Christian Norse religion and magic from both literary and archaeological studies. He then moves into providing a deeper study of Sei√∞r, or Norse magical practices, identifying shamanic elements within it. The book would be widely acclaimed by archaeologists working in European archaeology, and praised as a model for both future interdisciplinary research and for understanding past religious beliefs from an archaeological perspective. Background The origins of The Viking Way came from Price's doctoral research, which he undertook at the University of York's Department of Archaeology from October 1988 through to May 1992. Under the supervision of the archaeologists Steve Roskams and Richard Hall, Price had initially focused his research on the Anglo- Scandinavian tenements at 16-22 Coppergate in York, although eventually moved away from this to focus on archaeology within Scandinavia itself.Price 2002. p. 13. Personal circumstances meant that Price was unable to finish his doctoral thesis at York, and in 1992 he emigrated to Sweden, where he spent the following five years working as a field archaeologist. Despite his full- time employment, he continued to be engaged in archaeological research in a private capacity, publishing a series of academic papers and presenting others at conferences. In 1996 joined the Department of Archaeology at the University of Uppsala as a research scholar, beginning full-time work there the following year. At Uppsala, he went on to complete his doctoral thesis and gain his PhD under the supervision of Anne-Sofie Gr√§slund.Price 2002. p. 14. In undertaking research for his doctoral thesis, Price took great interest in circumpolar shamanism, attending academic conferences on this subject and reading much published material that had been produced by anthropologists. He found that much of the data which he collected in this area was ultimately of little use for his thesis, and so he included it in an edited anthology which he put together entitled The Archaeology of Shamanism (2001).Price 2002. p. 17. Synopsis =Part 1: Different Vikings? Towards a cognitive archaeology of the later Iron Age= Price opens The Viking Way with a discussion of why he chose to write the book, noting how he wanted to understand the mindset of the Scandinavians living in the Viking Age; in his own words, the book is his attempt to \\"write an explicitly 'cognitive' archaeology of the Vikings\\".Price 2002. pp. 25-27. He proceeds to explain his interdisciplinary approach to the subject of Norse paganism, drawing from textual sources as well as archaeology. Noting that this is a view that has been championed by post- processualists like Ian Hodder, he proceeds to discuss the manner in which the Scandinavian Late Iron Age is simultaneously viewed as the final period of prehistory and the first of the medieval.Price 2002. pp. 27-37. Price goes on to discuss the role of cognitive archaeology and its multiple problems, but nonetheless defends his position in taking a cognitive archaeological approach within his study. He then highlights the rise of Fourth World archaeology, a sub-section of world archaeology that focuses on the histories of contemporary indigenous peoples, and notes the impact which this has on his study, in particular regarding his work with the Sami people of Northern Europe. He highlights the need to recognise that modern archaeologists have many problems facing the cognitive understandings of past people like the Norse, arguing for the need to take an approach which he terms \\"odd archaeology\\", recognising the \\"oddness\\" of societies other than our own. He contrasts this \\"odd archaeology\\" with queer archaeology, which focuses on the study of deviants within any given society. He then rounds off the chapter by summarising the rest of The Viking Way's contents.Price 2002. pp. 38-48. =Part 2: Problems and paradigms in the study of Old Norse sorcery= After offering an overview of what is known about Norse mythology from surviving Scandinavian literary sources, Price continues to discuss the various research perspectives that have been adopted by past scholars investigating Norse paganism, including those of philologists and specialists in religious studies. Focusing on the pre- Christian religions themselves, he then discusses Iron Age Scandinavian beliefs regarding deities such as √ì√∞inn and √û√≥rr. Price moves on to look at the wide variety of other supernatural entities that existed within the Norse world-view: the servants of the gods (i.e. the valkyrja and Huginn and Muninn), the beings with cosmological purpose (i.e. the Nornir), the J√∂tnar, the supernatural beings of nature (i.e. dvergr and elves), 'spirits' and projections of the human soul. He then discusses the evidence for temples and sacred spaces in Iron Age Scandinavia, and the various priestly figures who would have carried out cultic functions.Price 2002. pp. 39-62. In the second part of the chapter, Price looks more specifically at the Norse magical practices, known as Sei√∞r. Noting that there were specific terms applying to different forms of magical practice in the Norse context, such as Galdr and Gandr, he also highlights the fact that sorcery was intricately connected to cultic practice. He then proceeds to look at the various literary sources which refer to Sei√∞r, such as the Skaldic poetry, Eddic poetry, the sagas of the kings, sagas of the Icelanders, the fornaldars«´gur, the Biskupas«´gur, law codes and also several non-Scandinavian sources. Finally, he offers an overview of earlier scholarly research into Sei√∞r, discussing a variety of studies published from the 19th century through to the beginning of the 21st.Price 2002. pp. 63-89. =Part 3: Sei√∞r= √ì√∞inn riding on his eight- legged horse Sleipnir, depicted on the Tj√§ngvide image stone. Price describes the god's association with sorcery and shamanism. The third chapter is devoted to an examination of the literary and archaeological evidence for Sei√∞r practices in Norse society. Price starts with an examination of the god √ì√∞inn, noting his literary associations with sorcery and shamanism, as well as identifying the shamanic and magical associations of those supernatural beings that served him, such as his horse Sleipnir and ravens Huginn and Muninn. Furthermore, he lists a total of 240 names which have been applied to √ì√∞inn in the Norse literature, illustrating his multi-faceted role in Norse religion. Moving on to look at another deity, Freyja, Price discusses her association with magic and sorcery, before then discussing shamanistic and magical elements in pagan Norse cosmology.Price 2002. pp. 97-111. Price goes on to look at the \\"performers\\" of Sei√∞r, the majority of whom were apparently female. He discusses various references to female magicians in Old Norse literature, and looks into the multitude of different words used for them, arguing that some of them may have referred to different categories of magician. He then proceeds to discuss male magicians, who were a minority in the surviving literature, being viewed as deviants who had committed ergi. He moves on to deal with accounts of the Sei√∞r-workers' assistants in the literature, before turning his attention to the burial evidence for Norse magical practitioners. Here, he notes that both inhumation and crematory burial can be interpreted as perhaps being the resting place of sorcerers if they are buried with items which likely had magical uses, such as staffs and narcotics. As evidence, Price highlights a number of Viking Age graves that have been excavated in Scandinavia and found to contain potentially magical items; this includes three inhumation burials at Birka in the town of Bj√∂rk√∂ in Uppland, and two cremation burials at Klinta in K√∂pings parish, √ñland, all of which were in Sweden, as well as a Danish grave from the cemetery at Fyrkat in Jylland and another from the Swedish cemetery at Aska in Hagebyh√∂ga parish, √ñsterg√∂tland. Looking at the Oseburg ship burial in Norway, he then looks at the burial of what appears to be an Anglo-Scandinavian individual from the Danelaw whom was discovered at Peel Castle on the Isle of Man.Price 2002. pp. 111-161. Price carries on by looking at the \\"performance\\" of Sei√∞r itself, discussing the potential use of ritual architecture and space, dealing with literary and archaeological evidence for sei√∞hjaller platforms, chair pendants, door frames and empty ritual space (√∫tiseta). He follows this with a study of the clothes that magical practitioners may have worn, discussing ideas regarding masks, veils and head coverings. Debating whether they made use of drums in their performance of Sei√∞r, he then undertakes a study of the use of staffs and wands in Nordic magic, highlighting the existence of a number of metal and wooden staffs found in the archaeological record. Moving on, he looks at the evidence for the entheogenic use of narcotics and intoxicants such as alcohol, henbane and cannabis. He then rounds off this section of the chapter with a discussion of charms, songs and chants, as well as debating whether we can understand the role of trance and ecstasy in sei√∞r.Price 2002. pp. 162-209. Price proceeds to deal with the gender concepts surrounding sei√∞r, and the fact that male practitioners of sorcery were viewed as social and sexual deviants who had committed ergi. Looking at the role of √ì√∞inn as sorcerer under the lens of queer theory, Price then discusses the evidence that Sei√∞r practices offered involved sexual acts such as masturbation. Moving on, he looks at the Norse concept of the soul, and the idea that sei√∞r practitioners could command spirits known as gandir. Finally, the chapter is brought to an end with a discussion of the domestic uses of sei√∞r, including divination, healing, hunting and weather magic.Price 2002. pp. 210-232. =Part 4: Noaidevuohta= =Part 5: Circumpolar religion and the question of Old Norse shamanism= Proceeding to discuss evidence for shamanism in Scandinavia, Price casts a critical eye on previous scholarship that has argued for the existence of shamanistic beliefs and practices from the Paleolithic through to the Viking Age, being particularly critical of Jimmy Strassburg's work. He then looks at the arguments that have previously been put forward describing sei√∞r as shamanic.Price 2002. pp. 312-. =Part 6: The supernatural empowerment of aggression= =Part 7: The Viking way= Reception and recognition =Academic reviews= The Viking Way was reviewed in the journal Antiquity by Matthew Townend of the University of York's Centre for Medieval Studies. Townend was of the opinion that Price's \\"exceptional\\" work represented \\"one of the most important contributions to Viking studies in recent years, quite possibly in recent decades\\", dealing as it did with the neglected area of magic in the Viking world. Praising Price's work as being \\"logical, persuasive and theoretically astute\\", he found much to commend it, opining that it had much to teach archaeologists, while at the same time being \\"very easy\\" to read, written in a prose style which was \\"lucid, and often stylish and witty\\". Furthermore, praising the use of illustrations and bibliography, he did however comment that the book would have been improved by the inclusion of an index.Townend 2003. Writing in Fornv√§nnen, the archaeologist Martin Carver of the University of York praised The Viking Way as a work of \\"impeccable and comprehensive scholarship\\", but noted that a better title might have been The Viking Mind. He commended the interdisciplinary approach that Carver utilized, noting that very few contemporary archaeologists had successfully taken such an approach, and expressed his opinion that Price had written a \\"spellbinding\\" work.Carver 2004. =Wider academic reception= In his book Shamanism in Norse Myth and Magic (2009), the English scholar Clive Tolley noted that his work overlapped with Price's The Viking Way in several respects, but that Price's work focused on an archaeological rather than a literary approach to the subject.Tolley 2009. p. xv. Reviewing Tolley's work in the Time and Mind journal, historian Ronald Hutton commented that Price's study had gained \\"much admiration\\" for its multidisciplinary approach. Comparing Price and Tolley's research, Hutton opined that the former played up the importance of Sami shamanic elements entering southern Scandinavia, while Tolley played it down, approaches that can be balanced with one another.Hutton 2011. pp. 225-226. Writing in his opening paper, \\"Agency, Intellect and the Archaeological Agenda\\", published in the academic anthology Signals of Belief in Early England: Anglo-Saxon Paganism Revisited (2010), Martin Carver quoted from Price's book, before remarking that this \\"remarkable\\" work has \\"done much to make the study of non- Christian religion once more respectable among archaeologists.\\"Carver 2010. p. 1.

Casey made his first on-screen appearance on 17 February 2011. Younes was about to go travelling when he auditioned for the role of Casey. He changed his plans upon winning the role. In late 2010 the Seven Network began airing trailers for a new trio of characters known as \\"The River Boys\\". The trio consist of Casey and his older half-brothers Darryl (Steve Peacocke) and Heath Braxton (Dan Ewing). The River Boys arrive in Summer Bay from neighbouring town Mangrove River. Casey is characterised as being a \\"modern day Rebel Without a Cause\\"; who is intelligent and unsure about what he wants out of life. Younes has described him as the \\"epitome of teenage angst\\". The River Boys cause trouble in Summer Bay and producers were inspired by Koby Abberton's Bra Boys in the creation process. Casey is portrayed as wanting to distance himself from their bad reputation; but his anger issues often mar his attempts. Casey is the first of the Braxton brothers to build friendships with established characters. He also begins a relationship with Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds). Younes was later required for filming of the television series Tangle; producers then devised an exit storyline to accommodate his temporary departure. The storyline consists of Casey succumbing to the bad reputation of the River Boys when he commits an arson attack against an adversary of the Braxton's. Casey was sentenced to time in juvenile detention and was given early release upon his return to the series. Casey and the rest of the River Boys have been well received by viewers. Critics also welcomed their inclusion in the series. Series producer Lucy Addario said that the response from fans had been \\"utterly overwhelming\\". However, Bree Hoskin of Gaydar Radio felt that Casey has been overshadowed by his brothers and a poll ran by Inside Soap indicated that Casey was not as popular as Darryl. Younes announced his intentions to leave Home and Away in March 2014 and Casey made his final appearance on 16 September 2014. Creation and casting In 2010, Network Seven began running teaser trailers for a new trio of characters known as The River Boys. Said to be a \\"bad-boy surf gang with dodgy reputations\\", The River Boys consist of three brothers ‚Äì Darryl, Casey and Heath. Kristy Kelly of Digital Spy reported Koby Abberton's Bra Boys were the inspiration for The River Boys. The Braxton brothers made their on screen debuts in February 2011. Younes had been starring in the television series Tangle; after which he felt depressed and received no auditions. He then planned to leave Australia, when the offer of five auditions came through, one of which was for Home and Away. After a successful audition for the serial, he decided to cancel his plans to play the part of Casey. Younes told the Bendigo Weekly that he was standing outside the travel agent when he received the call and he spent three days thinking about whether to accept the role. He has moved to Sydney to work on Home and Away. In comparison to his role on Tangle, Younes felt Home and Away offered a longer period of time to unravel a character. Character development =Characterisation= Steve Peacocke and Dan Ewing (pictured left to right) play Brax and Heath, who create a bad reputation for the Braxtons. Casey is the youngest of the Braxton brothers. The Daily Telegraph said that Casey is trying to break out of the River Boys mould and that he was kicked out of his last high school. Casey is described as being a \\"modern day Rebel Without a Cause.\\" He has never quite fitted in and he does not know what he wants from life. He has been overshadowed by both of his brothers and he has struggled at school. He was expelled from Reefton Lakes High for disruptive behaviour. However, Casey is intelligent and has resisted becoming a typical River Boy, instead he is a loner. Channel Seven said \\"When Casey eventually makes friends at Summer Bay High his true personality shines through, revealing a courageous, sensitive, mischievous guy, with a sly, laconic wit. However, acceptance at Summer Bay can be seen as betrayal in Mangrove River, putting Casey in conflict with some of his brother's River Boy mates.\\" Casey's mother leaves him to his own devices and he misinterprets that as disapproval from her. Holy Soap questioned whether a new life Summer Bay could be Casey's chance to turn his life around. Younes told Melinda Houston of The Age that Casey has come from the \\"wrong side of the tracks\\". Casey wants to \\"establish himself on the straight and narrow\\", while his brothers show little interest in following his example. Casey finds it hard to shake off the Braxtons' bad reputation and distance himself from his brothers. Although; Younes has opined that Casey does try to \\"break out of the mould set by his older brothers\\". Casey is a mixed up young man; Younes said that portraying Casey's confusion \\"screwed\\" with his head because he had previously been in a similar situation. Casey was the first of the Braxton brothers to befriend some of the locals of Summer Bay. He forges friendships with Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds), Xavier Austin (David Jones-Roberts) and Dexter Walker (Charles Cottier). Casey is also the first to display \\"softer emotions\\"; which often surface when he shares scenes with Ruby, who becomes Casey's love interest. Younes told a reporter from Channel 5 that Casey is not a \\"bad boy\\" role. Younes was attracted to the part of Casey because he is \\"a product of his two older brothers and their clashing personalities\\". He has both sensitive and volatile sides to his persona. Younes explained that as the \\"epitome of teenage angst\\", Casey does not have any idea of who he is. He does not know how to act around others and can be impressionable. Casey also has deep rooted issues with his anger; Younes said that he empathised with the way Casey feels due to his previous experiences. =Relationship with Ruby Buckton= In January 2011, Breeds told Debbie Schipp of The Advertiser that the River Boys added a new dynamic to the series. She revealed that Ruby would soon end up in a \\"love- hate relationship\\" with Casey. In February 2011, Younes told Alicia McCumstie of the Central Coast Express Advocate that Casey would get \\"more action\\" on the female front. It was also announced that Casey was to have a fling with Ruby, after her romance with Romeo Smith (Luke Mitchell) ends. When Ruby realises that Romeo is back with his girlfriend, she sleeps with Casey. He then takes \\"great pleasure\\" in revealing the details about Ruby's relationship with Romeo. When the pair begin a relationship, Ruby's mother Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson) does not approve. Anderson told TV Week that Charlie thinks Ruby is getting into a new relationship \\"too quickly\\". Brax offers Charlie parenting advice about Ruby's relationships; Anderson said that Charlie listens to the advice yet refuses to admit that Brax is correct. =Arson and temporary departure= Lincoln Younes (pictured) left Home and Away temporarily to film for the television series Tangle. In August 2011, it was announced that Younes would temporarily leave Home and Away; while he returned to film his part in the television series Tangle. Ewing revealed that the serial had developed a storyline to compensate Younes' departure. His exit storyline begins after the Braxton's feud with the Pivoric family heightens. Casey goes to Jake Pirovic's (Fletcher Humphrys) headquarters and sets fire to the building. Younes told TV Week that Casey commits arson to stop tension between the two gangs, but just makes the situation worse. Casey realises the ramifications of his actions and acknowledges that he did not want to turn out like his siblings. Younes said that Casey's \\"whole demeanour and mood changed because he knows what he's done\\". Casey \\"established himself as a River Boy\\" through his act, Younes opined that it \\"goes against everything he's been fighting for, as he's always tried not to be a River Boy.\\" As a consequence, Casey's relationship with Ruby is tested. Ruby betrays her mother and informs Casey that the police know that he committed the crime. Younes said that it \\"stretched their relationship quite a bit\\" because he places a lot of responsibility on Ruby; who has to keep his secret. Casey acts \\"unfairly\\" because he does not know what to do about the situation either. Heath tries to convince him to run from the law. Younes told Inside Soap that \\"Brax is afraid for Casey\\" because he knows the police will use the long arm of the law when they catch him. Brax makes Casey realise that he should hand himself over to the police. Younes observed Casey to be the most \\"emotional and volatile\\" of the Braxton brothers, adding that Casey \\"breaking down\\" is a rarity. So when Casey breaks down in front of Brax, it becomes clear that Casey is remorseful for his actions. Brax realises that Casey is \\"in too deep\\" and feels \\"scared\\" for his future. When Casey hands himself in to the police it changes his attitude. He remains afraid but loses his emotions and feelings near to the point of becoming stoical. Casey then pushes Ruby away; Younes explained that Casey thinks he is doing it for her own good because he does not want to \\"drag her down with him\\". Ruby does not understand Casey's actions, but he realises it will add to the \\"strain\\" on her when he is sent to jail. Casey is sentenced to thirty days in juvenile detention. Peacocke told TV Week that \\"Brax is disappointed that it's got to this because, he has always wanted to keep Casey out of trouble.\\" He said that Casey is not like Brax or Heath and because juvenile detention is \\"dangerous\\" he would not cope as well as they would. Younes confirmed that Casey's time in jail would not go well and viewers would see a \\"darker more wary Casey\\" upon his return. Ewing also said the storyline would \\"harden Casey up\\" and not return as the \\"same teenager\\" that departs. =Car accident= Casey is accompanied to Bianca and Heath's wedding party with new friend Maddy Osborne (Kassandra Clementi). She meets Josh Barrett (Jackson Gallagher) and flirts with him. Maddy's foster mother Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) attempts to convince a reluctant Maddy to leave the party so Casey agrees to look after her. She defies Casey by sneaking off with Josh. Younes told a reporter from TV Week that Casey is unhappy with Maddy's actions and believes she should not lose her virginity because she wants to rebel. When Casey drags Maddy away from Josh a fight ensues and they drive off. However Josh and his brother Andy Barrett (Tai Hara) start a car chase. Younes explained that Maddy is making amends for her behaviour towards Casey when a four-wheel-drive hits them and sends the car careering off the road. The actors explained that \\"Maddy is unconscious and the car is burning so he has to act very quickly, he's really hurt but manages to carry Maddy out of the car before it explodes.\\" The car then explodes and the impact knocks the duo to the ground. They are not thought to be missing and spend the night injured on the road side until Maddy manages to get help. Home and Away invested in big stunt scenes for the storyline. Younes revealed that he filmed his own stunts carrying Clementi when the explosion was carried out and he dived to the ground. The car chase scenes were filmed at night on location down a narrow road. Younes described the shoot as a \\"scary\\" scenario. The accident leaves Casey with life changing injuries and is bound to a wheelchair. The storyline sees him struggle to accept his situation and struggle to recover. Tamara tries to support Casey through his recovery despite his reluctance to use his wheel chair or attend physical therapy. Younes told Gavin Scott (TV Week) that Casey feels \\"completely deected and depressed, because Casey is such an active person, to come to terms with the fact he might not be able to be active again is incredibly hard. For him, as soon as he gets into that wheel chair it's giving up.\\" Younes did not enjoy using the wheel chair and found it \\"horrible\\" because of the emotional impact. When he researched the storyline many of the stories he encountered upset him. =Departure and death= Younes confirmed that 2014 would be his last year with Home and Away in the 22‚Äì28 March 2014 issue of TV Week. He explained that he did not see himself going beyond 2014 and was looking forward to going to Los Angeles to find new roles. Younes was not aware of what Casey's exit storyline would be, but hoped it would not be dull. Younes filmed his final scenes in May 2014. Casey departed on 16 September, after he was shot dead by Jake Pirovic while trying to save his kidnapped half-brother Josh Barrett (Jackson Gallagher). Channel Seven's head of drama Julie McGauran noted that the Braxton brothers \\"lived a life of crime\\" and there had to be consequences, so Casey had to be the one to pay the price. Younes was pleased with Casey's exit storyline and said \\"It made sense out of the three brothers that Casey was the one it would happen to. It was nice to see him, for a moment in time, turn into Brax and what Brax had taught him and that was to put family first. He died trying to protect him after Brax had spent his life protecting Casey...it was nice to see that switch.\\" Storylines Casey arrives in Summer Bay with his brothers Darryl, known as \\"Brax\\", and Heath, as their gang, the River Boys, are extending their turf beyond Mangrove River. Casey befriends Romeo Smith (Luke Mitchell), who becomes concerned about Casey's attitude situation. When Romeo goes to Casey's house, as he needs assistance with his school work, he realises that Casey has a bad home life. His alcoholic mother Cheryl Braxton (Suzi Dougherty) shows little interest in him and his older brothers Heath and Brax continuously puts him down. Casey has a one-night stand with Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds), who is attempting to move on from her ex Romeo. Casey furiously attacks Romeo when he discovers that he treated her poorly and ends their friendship. Casey and Ruby's attraction leads to a romantic relationship, but their future is put into question when they have to overcome disapproval from Ruby's police sergeant sister, Charlie, who cannot accept the fact he is a River Boy. Casey gets a job at Angelo's delivering pizza. He and Ruby organise a party at the home of one of his customers. Heath and the other River Boys gate crash the party, causing the police to break it up. Casey struggles with his school work and Miles Copeland (Josh Quong Tart) suspects that he may be dyslexic. Cheryl is angry at the school's recommendation that he gets tested. Miles decides to mentor Casey to help him through the HSC. Casey feels pressured by Cheryl to leave school, especially when she gets him a job at the fishery. Casey quits school, angering Brax, who feels Casey is throwing his bright future away. Brax endeavours to persuade Casey to return to school. When he does, Cheryl throws him out of the house and Brax hires a motel room for him to live in. Brax realises that the set-up is not practical, so he convinces Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) to let him live at her flat with Romeo and Indigo Walker (Samara Weaving). Casey lets Tegan Callahan (Saskia Burmeister) hide money belonging to rival gang member Jake Pirovic at his place. Jake kidnaps Casey and Ruby and when Brax turns up to rescue them, he is stabbed. Jake is arrested and sent to jail and his brother Hammer (Benedict Samuel) sets out to gain revenge on the Braxtons. Casey brings a knife into school in order to protect himself, just in case he is attacked and Miles sees it. Gina Austin (Sonia Todd) then excludes Casey. She later gives him a second chance so he can concentrate on the HSC. Shortly after, Casey dumps Ruby when he becomes annoyed at her constantly nagging him about the HSC. Casey is frustrated at being unable to help his older brothers in the fight with Hammer's gang. Casey decides against attending Tegan's funeral and he goes to Jake's place and sets it on fire. As everyone is at the funeral, no one is injured and the fire is put out. Brax learns Casey started the fire and while angry, he helps him cover his tracks. Georgina Watson (Jaclyn Albergoni) suspects Casey is behind the arson attack and questions him over the incident. The police later find CCTV evidence placing him in the area minutes before and after the fire. Heath tries to convince Casey to run away, but he hands himself in. Casey continues to push Ruby away to protect her. When he assumes she is flirting with Xavier Austin (David Jones-Roberts), they resume dating and she agrees to wait for him. On the day of Casey's court case, Magistrate Hanson (Rhett Walton) decides to make an example of Casey and sends him to jail for thirty days. Casey is later given early release and surprises Ruby by accompanying him to the school formal. He then comforts Ruby and Brax after Charlie is murdered by Jake. Heath's ex-girlfriend, Henrietta Brown (Emma Leonard), begins teaching at the high school and she becomes Casey's tutor. Casey develops a crush on her and they later share a kiss. Casey and Henri begin a secret relationship, but when Heath finds out, he publicly outs the affair to Gina. Henri ends the relationship and leaves the Bay. Sasha Bezmel (Demi Harman) supports Casey when he is bullied by a teacher and she later confesses her feelings for him, but Casey reveals he does not feel the same way. Casey meets his father, Danny (Andy McPhee), and decides to forge a relationship with him. However, he later admits to Brax that he is spending time with Danny, so he can stop him from targeting Ruby and her money. Danny involves Casey in his plan to rob a pub. When Danny tells Casey to shoot the owner, he refuses and shoots Danny instead and he dies. Casey struggles to cope with what he has done and he later goes out to the forest with Sasha, where he has sex with her. He later dismisses their night together, upsetting Sasha. Casey is kidnapped by his half-brother, Kyle Bennett (Nic Westaway) who wants to avenge their father's death and is taken to the desert and deprived of food and water. Kyle forces Casey to make a goodbye call to Brax unaware that Casey gives Brax hints to his location before Kyle leaves him to die of thirst and hunger. Tamara Kingsley (Kelly Paterniti) finds Casey and gives him water. Kyle soon returns after learning of Brax searching for Casey and forces both he and Tamara into his truck. Casey distracts Kyle long enough for Tamara to escape. She seriously injures Kyle after throwing a lit petrol container at him, which alerts Brax to Casey's location. He and Natalie Davison (Catherine Mack) rescue Casey and take him home. Tamara turns up in the Bay for Casey's court case. Casey develops feelings for her and they begin dating. Casey is wrongfully arrested for a robbery that he did not commit. Ricky Sharpe (Bonnie Sveen) later confesses to framing Casey on the orders of her brother, Adam (Martin Lynes). On his release from prison, Casey refuses to forgive Ricky which causes a strain in his relationship with Brax when he starts a relationship with Ricky. After Tamara is kidnapped by Adam, the trauma causes her to lose her memories of her time in the Bay. Casey tries to get her to remember him and he is devastated when she begins a relationship with Kyle. Having a difficult time coping with losing Tamara, Casey starts drinking heavily and isolates himself from his friends and family. After a night of partying with Maddy Osborne (Kassandra Clementi), Casey suffers from alcohol poisoning and is rushed to the hospital but later recovers. Whilst driving her home from Heath and Bianca Scott's (Lisa Gormley) beach party wedding reception, Casey and Maddy are run off the road by Josh (Jackson Gallagher) and Andy Barrett (Tai Hara) and he suffers a spinal injury. Casey has difficulty coping with the news that he may be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Brax and Heath are furious upon finding out the truth but are stopped by Bianca and Maddy from taking revenge against the Barretts. A depressed Casey refuses to get out of bed to try his wheelchair or go for physiotherapy. After much persuasion from Tamara and Dexter Walker (Charles Cottier) he begins his recovery and takes his first steps. While recovering, Casey and Tamara rekindle their relationship and Tamara breaks up with Kyle. Torn between his love for Tamara and loyalty to his brother, Kyle chooses to let Tamara go, but Casey later breaks up with Tamara, believing their relationship is no longer right. Casey supports his brothers through tough times and has a brief fling with a girl called Linda Somerset (Hannah Britland) when the brothers visit London together. Back in the bay, Casey struggles when Brax reveals that he is in fact the son of Johnny Barrett; making him Josh Barrett's half-brother, and meaning that Kyle is unrelated to him. He feels betrayed that Brax kept this from him for several months, but eventually comes to accept it with the help of Denny Miller (Jessica Grace Smith). Casey helps Tamara when she is hit by a car and her eyesight is affected due a bleed in her brain, and eventually convinces her to leave Summer Bay to get treatment near where her parents live. Denny's boyfriend Chris Harrington (Johnny Ruffo) becomes jealous and punches Casey when he believes he has feelings for Denny; afterwards, Casey and Denny briefly end their friendship before realising their feelings for each other and begin dating after Denny breaks up with Chris. Casey realises Andy is dealing drugs for Jake, who has escaped from prison where he had been serving his sentence for Charlie's murder, and tries to stop him; the situation escalates further when Brax discovers Andy's actions and Jake holds Josh hostage. Casey rushes to Josh's aid and is shot by Jake, saving Josh's life. Casey then dies in Brax's arms. In 2015, Ricky gave birth to her and Brax's son and they named their son after Casey in his honour. Reception For his portrayal of Casey, Younes won Best Daytime Star at the 2014 Inside Soap Awards. A columnist for the Sunday Mail said that Casey was the \\"baby of the family\\" and wondered whether he was \\"bad to the core or just misunderstood\\". In March 2011, Inside Soap asked their readers to decide which of the Braxton brothers they liked the most. Brax was deemed the most liked, while Casey and Heath both received twenty-eight percent of the vote each. Bree Hoskin of Gaydar Radio said that Casey is overshadowed by his brothers and struggles to fit in. She added that there is \\"definitely a soft centre underneath Casey's hard, buff exterior\\". The River Boys have proved popular with viewers. Claire Crick of All About Soap said the publications staff were content with the River Boy's arriving in Summer Bay. They added that the only thing they like more than \\"a new bad boy\\" is \\"three arriving at the same time and especially when they are this hot.\\" In the Inside Soap Yearbook 2012, the arrival of the River Boys was included in their \\"best bits\\" of March 2011. Their reporter noted that while residents of Summer Bay were not happy about them moving to the area ‚Äì viewers were \\"aquiver\\" at the prospect. Overseas broadcaster Channel 5 aired a special series titled \\"Top 20 Aussie Soap Moments of 2011\\". The programme's content was generated via public to determine the best moments in Australian soaps in 2011. The River Boy's arrival in the series was voted the fourth best moment of that year. With their fictional counterparts rise in popularity, came false Facebook accounts were made in the actor names. Fans also bombarded their real accounts on the social networking site with friend requests. While interviewed by Jason Herbison of Inside Soap, series producer Lucy Addario said that the response from fans, concerning the River Boys had been \\"utterly overwhelming\\". She added that their inclusion meant the series could \\"explore many different storylines and play out lots of great plots.\\" References External links * Character profile at the Official AU Home and Away website * Character profile at the Official UK Home and Away website * Character profile at the Internet Movie Database Home and Away characters Television characters introduced in 2011 Fictional murderers Fictional personal trainers Fictional victims of kidnapping Fictional patricides Fictional surfers Fictional gang members Male characters in television Fictional criminals on soap operas ","title":"Casey Braxton"},{"id":"34227367","text":"Ju Kyu-chang (25 November 1928 ‚Äì 3 September 2018) was a North Korean politician, who served as the director of the Workers' Party of Korea's (WPK) Machine-Building Industry Department.

It was first organized as the 1st Alabama Volunteer Infantry Regiment (African Descent) in May 1863, serving on garrison duty at Corinth, Mississippi and Memphis, Tennessee. It was redesignated as the 55th United States Colored Infantry in March 1864, continuing its garrison service in Tennessee and fighting at the Battle of Brices Cross Roads. After the end of the war, the regiment was mustered out in late 1865 after garrison duty in Louisiana.  History  = Corinth = A bronze statue representing a USCT at Corinth Contraband CampThe men who would form the regiment were raised in 1863 at the Corinth Contraband Camp as two companies under the command of 66th Illinois Infantry chaplain James M. Alexander. These 200 men were to guard the camp after objections from white soldiers regarding this duty. Brigadier General Grenville M. Dodge, commander of the District of Corinth, received permission to raise one or two regiments of African-Americans, and by May 19 a total of 600 men had been recruited. The 1st Alabama Volunteer Infantry Regiment (African Descent) was organized at the Corinth Contraband Camp on May 21, an unattached unit of the District of Corinth, part of the 2nd Division, XVI Corps, Department of the Tennessee. The regiment received its designation due to a large number of its men being freed slaves who had escaped from western Alabama. Alexander was appointed Colonel, and supervised several days of drill in late May before the regiment was put on guard, picket, and fatigue duty. Picket posts manned by the 1st Alabama were located at the Hamburg, Glendale, Clear Creek and Danville Roads on the eastern approaches to Corinth. The regiment received the national colors in a June 21 ceremony. In October, Company A transferred to Pocahontas, Tennessee to guard a bridge along the Memphis-Corinth military railroad, returning to Corinth during the month. Companies B, C, E, G, H, and K were sent to Big Hill, Tennessee in the same month to guard another bridge on the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, returning to Corinth by November. The regiment continued to serve on garrison duty at Corinth, and was assigned to the Post of Corinth under the 2nd Division in November. = Memphis, Sturgis' expedition, and Smith's expedition = The regiment transferred in January 1864 to the 1st Colored Brigade of the District of Memphis, part of the corps' 5th Division, serving on garrison duty at Memphis. Relations between civilians and the colored troops at Memphis became strained due to civilian complaints of nighttime pillaging by colored troops. The regiment was redesignated as the 55th United States Colored Infantry Regiment on March 11, when most colored units with state designations switched to Federal designations. It was transferred to Fort Pickering in the Post and Defenses of Memphis, part of the District of West Tennessee, in April. Between 1 and 13 June the 55th participated in Brigadier General Samuel D. Sturgis' expedition into Mississippi as part of the 3rd Brigade of its Infantry Division. The regiment assembled with the expedition at Lafayette in the first days of June, having moved there by rail alongside the 59th United States Colored Infantry, the other regiment of the brigade. The colonel of the 59th, Edward Bouton, was placed in command of the brigade. The expedition set out before down on 3 June through heavy rain, with the 55th and 59th Regiments guarding the wagon train. The train caught up with the main body of the expedition on 4 June, and remained in camp on 5 June. It reached Ripley two days later and advanced towards Tupelo on the morning of 10 June. At this point the regiment was split up along the wagon train with four men walking beside each wagon. The regiment fought in the Union defeat at the Battle of Brices Cross Roads on 10 June, the retreat through Ripley on 11 June, and the engagement at Davis' Mills on 12 June. The regiment returned to Memphis, rejoining the 1st Colored Brigade, now part of the District of West Tennessee. From 1 to 30 August the regiment fought in Major General Andrew Jackson Smith's expedition to Oxford, Mississippi, participating in the action at Waterford between 16 and 17 August. The 55th returned to Memphis, where it briefly transferred to the 2nd Brigade of the Post and Defenses of Memphis in January 1865. = Louisiana = The regiment was ordered to New Orleans on 23 February and then to Morganza, becoming part of the 2nd Brigade, United States Colored Troops, of the District of Morganza in the Department of the Gulf.

The Suid- Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns (SAAWK) (literally South African Academy for Science and Arts) is a multidisciplinary organization dedicated to promoting science, technology and the arts in Afrikaans, as well as promoting the use and quality of Afrikaans. The Hertzog Prize is awarded annually by the academy for high-quality literary work, while the Havenga prize is awarded annually for original research in the sciences.  Origin  The initiative for the founding of the SAAWK came from General J. B. M. Hertzog who championed the Dutch-Afrikaans language. He suggested \\"dat een lichaam in 't leven worde geroepen ter bevordering van de Hollandse taal en letteren in Zuid-Afrika\\" (that one organisation be established to promote the Dutch language and literature in South Africa). On 2 July 1909, the first 30 members of the body gathered to form the \\"Zuid-Afrikaanse Akademie voor Taal, Letteren en Kunst\\" (South African Academy for Language, Literature and Art). The aim of the academy was \\"The enforcement and promotion of Dutch Language and Literature, and of the South African History, Archeology and Art\\", with an addendum that Dutch implied both Dutch and Afrikaans, as both languages were common in South Africa at the time. The name of the Academy was changed to the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns in 1942 when a \\"science and technology\\" faculty was created. Since then, it has been responsible for the establishment of, among others, the Simon van der Stel Foundation and the Africa Institute. Furthermore, the Academy strives to promote interest in South African history, antiquities, art and Afrikaans language and literature. The Academy has become known over the years because of the regular awarding of literary prizes (of which the Hertzog Prize is best known) and other prestigious awards such as the N. P. van Wyk Louw medal. Honorary membership of the Academy is regarded as an exceptionally high honour, although it is not accompanied by any prize or prize money. A person considered for honorary membership of the Academy is nominated in recognition of exceptional service to South Africa, the Afrikaans language, or to the Academy in particular.  Change in status  In the early 1990s it was decided that a new organisation should be created to be the representative national science academy for South Africa. To this end the president of the Foundation for Research and Development invited the Royal Society of South Africa (RSSAf), the Suid- Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns (SAAWK) and the Science and Engineering Academy of South Africa (SEASA) to jointly plan a new academy. This led to the creation of The Academy of Science of South Africa (ASSAf) in 1995. Act 67 of 2001, the ASSAf Statute, revoked the SAAWK statute and ASSAf became the only national science academy of South Africa. In response to this the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns registered in 2002 as a Nonprofit company.

He made just one first-class appearance for Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1932. As a snooker player he was twice runner-up in the English Amateur Championship and reached the semi-final of the World Snooker Championship four times between 1948 and 1953. Early life Brown was born in Birmingham, Warwickshire on 10 July 1911. He attended a boarding school from the age of seven, where he started playing English billiards on a three- quarter size billiard table and won the school championship for nine successive years. After leaving school, Brown's sporting focus was on cricket rather than cue sports, and he did not play billiards again until the age of 24, shortly after which a friend introduce him to snooker. A year after taking up snooker, Brown won the Midland Amateur Championship, defeating Kingsley Kennerley 4‚Äì0 in the final. He won the title again the following year, and after a hiatus in the championship being staged during World War II, completed a run of three wins. Before becoming a professional snooker player, he worked as a bus driver. Cricket Between snooker seasons, Brown played cricket. A fast bowler, he was invited to play for Warwickshire after achieving hat tricks in consecutive weeks. Brown made a single first-class appearance for Warwickshire against the touring Indians at Edgbaston in 1932. The Indians made 282 all out in their first-innings, with Brown taking the wickets of Naoomal Jeoomal and Amar Singh to finish with figures of 2/61 from 22 overs. In Warwickshire's first-innings of 354 all out, Brown ended the innings not out on a single run. He bowled 14 wicketless overs in the Indians second- innings of 344 declared and wasn't required to bat in Warwickshire's second- innings of 110/3, with the match being declared a draw.

In 1977, she wrote the book Years of Infamy: The Untold Story of America‚Äôs Concentration Camps, which fueled a movement leading to reparations for Japanese Americans interned during World War II, for which she was awarded the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award in the same year. She was also a vocal advocate for those denied redress under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 and for the more than 2,200 Japanese Peruvians who were taken from their homes by the U.S. government and used in a hostage exchange program with Japan. Biography Michiko Nishiura was born into a farming family in Stockton, California, in 1926, the eldest of two daughters to Japanese immigrants Tomojiro and Misao Nishiura. The family worked as tenant farmers in Brentwood, and Weglyn attended Liberty Union High School, receiving a citizenship award from the American Legion in 1940. In May 1942, she was interned with her family at the Turlock Assembly Center, before being transferred to the Gila River War Relocation Center in Arizona three months later. While in Gila River, she attended the camp school, Butte High, and kept busy with various extracurricular activities, leading a Girl Scouts troop, the Butte Forensics League, and a young women's association. She graduated in 1944 and, after receiving a full scholarship to Mount Holyoke College, left camp for Massachusetts. Weglyn attended Mount Holyoke from 1944 to 1945, majoring in biology, but a bout with tuberculosis forced her to enter a sanatorium in New Jersey and withdraw from college without a diploma. Her mother and sister moved to New Jersey to work at Seabrook Farms in January 1945, and Weglyn joined them after finishing her treatment. She later attended Barnard College in 1947 and 1948. In 1949, she suffered another bout of tuberculosis and once again had to seek treatment at a sanatorium. Weglyn then moved to New York City, where she met her husband, Walter Weglyn, a German Jew who had escaped Nazi Germany as a teenager, and the couple married in 1950. During the 1950s and 1960s, Weglyn became a designer and manufacturer of theatrical costumes, and she worked for the Perry Como Show from 1957 to 1966. During her eight years with the show, she became the first and only Japanese American of the era to achieve national prominence in theatrical costume design.Mount Holyoke Alumnae Association, \\"Alumnae and Students of Color Conference,\\" (November 2007), p 3. Retrieved March 22, 2014. During the 1960s, Weglyn began work on the influential Years of Infamy: The Untold Story of America‚Äôs Concentration Camps, which was the first book to be written on the internment by a Japanese American. Published in 1976, it detailed U.S. governmental misconduct toward Japanese Americans following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and offered a staunch rebuttal of the military necessity argument for incarceration. Weglyn also highlighted issues that had not been covered in previous works, such as protest movements that had developed in camp and the internment of Japanese Latin Americans in U.S. concentration camps. The book would win one of the Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards in 1977 and helped launch the movement that led to reparations Japanese Americans interned during World War II. Following the book's publication, Weglyn became an advocate for Japanese Americans denied redress under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 and for Japanese Peruvians who had been taken from their homes by the U.S. government and used in a hostage exchange program with Japan. For her work, Weglyn received honorary doctorates from Hunter College, California State University, and Mount Holyoke College. Weglyn died in 1999 in New York City at the age of 72.

At 17, he took first place at a French speaking competition and won a trip to France, where he learned about Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris and Joan Miro. In 1938 he enrolled in the school of architecture at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, where he graduated in 1941. At the age of 25 he presented his first solo watercolor exhibition at the Chilean Institute of Culture. Thanks to a scholarship from the Fulbright Program, he traveled to Columbia University in New York. Upon completing his Master's degree in 1947, he began working in the studio Atelier 17 with Stanley William Hayter, who applied the techniques of printmaking to surrealist art. He worked with his brother Enrique to explore the possibilities of old printmaking techniques from artists like Yves Tanguy, Kurt Seligmann, Jacques Lipchitz and Joan Miro.

In a career spanning the Victorian, Edwardian and interwar eras, they were responsible for designing and constructing an eclectic range of buildings in the growing town of Brighton and its neighbour Hove. Their work encompassed new residential, commercial, industrial and civic buildings, shopping arcades, churches, schools, cinemas and pubs, and alterations to hotels and other buildings. Later reconstituted as Clayton, Black & Daviel, the company designed some churches in the postwar period. Charles E. Clayton and Ernest Black, their sons Charles L. Clayton and Kenneth Black, and other architects articled to the firm, worked in a range of styles. The \\"architectural pantomime\\" of their Tudor Revival King and Queen pub and the elaborate Classical fa√ßade of the First Church of Christ, Scientist contrast with their plain Neo-Georgian Barclays Bank branch and the Gothic Revival St Thomas the Apostle's Church. Elsewhere in Brighton and Hove, they designed buildings in the Flemish Renaissance, Arts and Crafts, Art Deco and Fran√ßois Premier Revival styles. Many Clayton & Black buildings have been awarded listed status by English Heritage in view of their architectural importance‚Äîincluding their pink Baroque-style office for the Royal Assurance Society, described as their chef d'≈ìuvre. Company history 10 Prince Albert Street in The Lanes was the firm's base from 1904. Charles Edward Clayton was born in 1853 in Brighton, and Ernest Black, son of the Brighton coroner, was born there two years later. Clayton entered architectural practice in 1876 with George Holford; both studied under the Brighton architect Thomas Simpson. Black joined six years later, and Holford's involvement ceased the following year. Charles L. Clayton and Kenneth R. Black, sons of the original partners, joined later; the name \\"Clayton & Black\\" was maintained, although \\"Clayton, Black & Partners\\" was sometimes used as well. Charles E. Clayton, who made his home in Edburton near Brighton and who was mainly responsible for church- related commissions, died in 1923; Ernest Black had died six years earlier. Other partners joined the firm later in the interwar period as its success grew, but the final name change did not occur until John Ren√© Francis Daviel joined in the early 1950s and became the main driving force: thereafter the company was known as \\"Clayton, Black and Daviel\\". The last record of the company was in 1974. Several other architects were articled to the firm at various times, such as Thomas Handy Bishop (between 1892 and 1893). John Owen Bond (between 1900 and 1903), Bernard Jessop (1908), and George Stanley Hudson. M.G. Alford joined in the 1960s, during the Clayton, Black and Daviel era. Clayton & Black's first recorded work was their rebuild of Blenheim House in Brighton's Old Steine. From 1895, the firm was responsible for a large area of expansive red-brick housing in Hove. Brighton and Hove were unusual among British towns and cities for the extent to which locally based architects received commissions for major buildings. Clayton & Black was the most prolific of three Brighton-based firms which between them designed dozens of residential, commercial, ecclesiastical and other buildings in the late 19th and early to mid-20th century in the rapidly growing towns. The others were Thomas Lainson (Lainson & Sons) and John Leopold Denman (Denman & Son). Clayton & Black were the most \\"solidly commercial\\" of these, and commercial buildings represent their best work. The practice was recorded at 152 North Street in Brighton in 1890. From 1904, the firm were based in offices at 10 Prince Albert Street‚Äîone of a terrace of four buildings on a road built in 1842 to improve links within The Lanes, the ancient heart of Brighton. Sources disagree on whether the building, which is Grade II-listed, is late 18th- century or contemporary with the street, but Clayton & Black remodelled it extensively when they took over, giving it a firmly Georgian appearance. Gwydyr Mansions (1890) are in the Flemish Renaissaince style. The first recorded commission for the firm, around 1875‚Äì76, was a complete rebuild of Blenheim House (56 Old Steine) in the centre of Brighton. This was one of several old buildings (along with Marlborough House and Steine House) on the west side of Brighton's first fashionable area, the low-lying grassland of Old Steine. In 1876‚Äì77, they extended the Brighton Friends Meeting House, built for Quakers in 1805, and in 1894 they extended and comprehensively redesigned the town's famous Theatre Royal, partly in response to new fire regulations. Much of the firm's early work, though, consisted of housebuilding and surveying in the rapidly developing residential town of Hove, a comfortable middle-class counterpoint to the neighbouring resort of Brighton, in which \\"a certain gentility prevails\\" in the spacious streets of finely detailed houses. The landmark Gwydyr Mansions at the bottom of Holland Road, a Flemish Renaissance red-brick and ashlar block of mansion flats with integral facilities such as a restaurant and barber shop, date from 1890. Their next work was in Lansdowne Road (1891), Furze Hill (1893), Holland Road (1895: a studio) and Portland Road (1895: several pairs of semi-detached houses and villas). On Holland Road, a major north‚Äìsouth route, they were also responsible for shops, flats and a religious institute in 1898, a factory for Green & Company in 1911, and a set of garages in 1925. From 1895, they were the main surveyors to the Vallance Estate, a development of high-class Domestic Revival/Queen Anne-style red-brick housing on land owned by the Vallance family. In particular, they were engaged at Pembroke Crescent and Pembroke Avenue, part of the Pembroke & Princes conservation area, almost continuously between 1895 and 1906, and at Vallance Road and Vallance Gardens until 1907. At the same time, but back in Brighton, they built a seaside convalescent home for French nationals who were patients at the French Hospital in London. The distinctive turreted structure is now Grade II-listed. Also contemporary were a veterinary surgery on Goldsmid Road and the small terraced streets between Old Shoreham Road, Sackville Road and the railway line‚ÄîFrith, Poynter, Landseer, Prinsep and Leighton Roads. Between 1892 and 1900 they also built up Sackville Road, another important north‚Äìsouth route, with shops, houses and the vicarage of St Barnabas' Church. In 1894‚Äì97, they were responsible for a large complex of school buildings in the Aldrington area of Hove, and in 1900 they designed and built a new hall at the Ellen Street schools in Hove (demolished in 1974)‚Äîan elaborate Queen Anne-style building designed in 1877 by Thomas Simpson, under whom Clayton was studying at that time. Edwardian Baroque structure. Two places of worship followed in the early 20th century: for Baptists, the firm provided a \\"mission hall\\" (as it was described in the plan submitted to the borough council) on Lennox Road in the Aldrington area of Hove in 1903; and for the Church of England, they designed St Thomas the Apostle's Church on Davigdor Road in 1906. These were the first examples of commissions for religious buildings which came intermittently throughout the firm's history. From the early 20th century the firm received more and more commissions for commercial buildings, and buildings such as offices and banks characterised the next decades. They designed a \\"magnificent\\" furniture depository in Hove for Hannington's department store (completed in 1904), then executed their most celebrated design: a tall, landmark office for the Royal Assurance Society, on a prominent corner site on Brighton's North Street. After making major alterations to their new office in Prince Albert Street, they designed a pub on the main London Road‚Äîlike many of their buildings, it had a corner turret topped with a dome‚Äîin 1905. A year later, they extended the Royal Alexandra Hospital in the Montpelier area of Brighton. Baroque style. The Tudor Revival King and Queen pub is a distinctive presence on Marlborough Place. Their work in the second decade of the 20th century encompassed some pioneering buildings: one of England's first cinemas, some of Brighton's earliest council housing (in a \\"highly attractive\\" Arts and Crafts style) and a major addition to Brighton's new Palace Pier All of these buildings were started in 1910. The firm then concentrated on housebuilding in Hove for the rest of the decade, taking on work at Lawrence Road (1911), Hove Street (1911), New Church Road (1914) and Kingsway (1915). In 1920 they undertook more work for St Barnabas' Church, whose vicarage they had previously designed: they built a church hall on the east side of Sackville Road, replacing several other halls and institutes in the area. Founded in July 1920, it was completed in 1921 and cost ¬£5,758. The area was subject to postwar urban renewal, and the building was demolished in 1965 in favour of flats with an integral hall. Later in the 1920s, commissions came for bank branches in Brighton (the National Provincial Bank on North Street, designed by F.C.R. Palmer in 1921‚Äì23 but supervised and executed by Clayton & Black, and a Capital & Counties Bank, now Lloyds Bank, on the same street), a new shopping arcade (Imperial Arcade, executed in 1923‚Äì24 in a distinctive Art Deco style), Hove's new fire station and a dairy, which they also designed along Art Deco lines. It is one of the few Clayton & Black buildings to have been demolished. One of their most \\"striking\\" and memorable commissions then came in 1931, when the owners of the King and Queen pub on Marlborough Place decided to rebuild the 18th-century former farmhouse. The result‚Äîan elaborate Tudor Revival \\"pantomime\\" with careful facsimiles of typical 16th-century features‚Äîwas called \\"a gorgeous flight of architectural imagination\\" by the Brighton Herald. A plainer, Classical-style building‚Äîanother insurance company office‚Äîfollowed later in the 1930s, in connection with the widening of West Street in Brighton. The firm concentrated on churches after World War II, when John R.F. Daviel joined the firm. New Anglican churches for two recently built housing estates, Hollingdean and Mile Oak, were provided in 1954 and 1967 respectively. The Church of the Good Shepherd at Mile Oak was provided on the initiative of the Sussex Churches Campaign. The firm was still in business in 1974; their last recorded work was an extensive restoration of Christ Church in Sayers Common, a village north of Brighton. Daviel was responsible for this work. Summary of works =New buildings= ;Gwydyr Mansions, Holland Road, Hove (1890) Named after Peter Drummond-Burrell, 22nd Baron Willoughby de Eresby, who at the time of his visits to Hove's Brunswick estate in the 1820s was the 2nd Baron Gwydyr, these were built on the initiative of the Holland Road Baptist Church's pastor. Wealthy people were expected to occupy the building: the 50 flats each had a room for a servant. From the start it had a 60-seater residents' restaurant and a basement barber shop. The latter is still in operation and was refitted in vitrolite in 1936. The building has bands of red brick and ashlar, oriel and canted bay windows, corner turrets, expansive gables and an entrance set between Tuscan columns and below a pediment. French Convalescent Home on Brighton seafront resembles a ch√¢teau. ;French Convalescent Home, De Courcel Road, Brighton (1895‚Äì1898; Grade II- listed) Built at Black Rock on behalf of the French government, this building's curious French Renaissance Revival styling makes it appear \\"out of place on Brighton's seafront\\" (which consists almost exclusively of stuccoed Regency-style buildings). Described variously as \\"drab\\", \\"gauche\\", \\"chateau- like\\" and \\"interesting\\", it was closed in 1999 and converted into luxury flats. Steep-roofed pavilions with some ironwork were added in 1904 and 1907. ;Portland Road Schools, Hove (1897) When Aldrington was absorbed into the Borough of Hove in 1894, more school accommodation was needed. Clayton & Black were commissioned to execute the School Board's \\"grandiose plans\\" for three blocks accommodating about 1,200 children and associated facilities. Limited finances meant the plans had to be redesigned, and the firm provided for a single block for 580 children. An extension was needed by 1904, however, and Clayton & Black were commissioned again. They had to work to a modest budget, and problems with the design of the fireplaces caused Charles Clayton to return in 1907 and carry out more work. The red-brick buildings are still in use under the name West Hove Junior School. Montefiore Hospital. ;Hannington's Depository (now Montefiore Hospital), Montefiore Road, Hove (1899‚Äì1904) Hannington's was Brighton's oldest and most famous department store. The company set up a nationwide removals business and commissioned Clayton & Black to design a furniture repository. The plans were approved in 1899, but the land was not bought until 1901 and construction work apparently continued until 1904. Described as \\"a magnificent red-brick building embellished with white stone and fine arched windows\\", it stands on a corner and has a domed turret. The Davigdor Road elevation is wide, and the building goes back along Montefiore Road. It was \\"elegantly converted\\" by Devereux and Partners in 1972 into an office for Legal & General. In 2012 it was redeveloped as a private hospital by Spire Healthcare. ;Royal Assurance Society offices, 163 North Street (1904; Grade II-listed) Clayton & Black's chef d'≈ìuvre has been called \\"an ebullient essay in Edwardian Baroque, the \\"most impressive\\" building on North Street, and \\"a confident composition in delicate pink granite\\". Later used by the Leeds Permanent Building Society and now by a bookmaker, the three-storey building has elevations to North Street and New Road, and a corner bay in which the entrance is set between Tuscan columns and beneath an arched pediment. At each corner is a tower; another topped with a copper dome sits above the entrance bay. ;Branch Tavern, London Road, Brighton (1905) One of several pubs on the stretch of London Road south of Preston Circus, this corner-site building is distinguished by a corner turret of square form with an ogee-shaped cap. The gables are timber-framed. Soon after its construction, the building was occupied by \\"William Barge, beer retailer\\". ;Electric Bus Garage and Recharging Station, Montague Place, Kemptown (1908; Grade II-listed) This modest single-storey brick-built garage was built in 1908 for the Brighton, Hove and Preston United Omnibus Company (predecessors of the present Brighton & Hove bus company). It was used to recharge the company's fleet of electric buses, which were introduced from mid-1909. With minimal alteration it later became a standard bus garage and then a garage and repair shop for private motor vehicles. ;Duke of York's Picture House, Preston Circus, Brighton (1910; Grade II-listed) Latterly \\"a little battered\\" but retaining much of its original appearance, and restored in 1994 when its ownership changed, this is England's oldest continuously operational cinema. Clayton & Black incorporated some of the walls of the former Amber Ale brewery, which stood on the site, into the new building. The Baroque building has a three-bay fa√ßade whose outer sections are formed of slightly taller, fully rusticated towers. A four-arch Palladian/Classical- style arcade runs across the ground floor. 23‚Äì30 High Street are \\"highly attractive\\" council houses of 1910. ;23‚Äì30 High Street, Brighton (1910; Grade II-listed) A short terrace of Arts and Crafts-style houses on a sloping site, this \\"highly attractive\\" composition was designed for Brighton Corporation as one of the earliest sets of council housing in the town. There are prominent mullions and timbered gables, and the walls are covered with roughcast. ;Winter Garden at Palace Pier, Brighton (1910‚Äì11) The landmark Palace Pier, built between 1899 and 1909 by Arthur Mayoh to a design by R. St George Moore, was immediately popular and received various additions over the years. One of the first was the Winter Garden, a round iron-framed pavilion flanked by vaguely Art Nouveau towers. It is now the Palace of Fun. ;National Provincial Bank, 155‚Äì158 North Street, Brighton (1921‚Äì23; Grade II-listed) This stone building on a corner site, now a bar, was executed by Clayton & Black using a design developed by F.C.R. Palmer. It is in the Louis XVI style, heavily rusticated and intricately carved even on the roofline, where the dormer windows have distinctive architraves. The entrance is set in the chamfered corner and is set below a Diocletian window and a series of bas-reliefs. ;Imperial Arcade, Western Road, Brighton (1923‚Äì24) \\"Unmistakably Art Deco\\" and resembling the prow of a ship, this curved shopping arcade is highly visible on its corner site and has strong horizontal lines contrasting with tall vertical windows. Hove's former fire station dates from 1926. ;Hove Fire Station, Hove Street, Hove (1926) Hove's new fire station, replacing an outdated facility in George Street, opened on 2 June 1926. James Barnes & Sons of Brighton built it to Clayton & Black's design at a cost of ¬£11,098. It was closed in 1976 when a new station opened elsewhere, and was converted into flats between 1978 and 1981. Clayton & Black's design was \\"elegant\\": a \\"charming\\" bellcote on the roof bore similarities with that at Hove Manor, demolished soon afterwards, and the fire-engine entrances were arched. ;Unigate Dairy and Bottling Plant, Davigdor Road, Hove ( 1928‚Äì30; demolished) An \\"impressive\\" and \\"interesting\\" building in the then-popular Art Deco style, this was built for a local dairy firm as a bottling plant. Large plate-glass windows, a glazed entrance framed by scrolls and a pediment-like element and the use of alternating wide and narrow ranges of horizontal windows suggested \\"a well chosen use of [the Art Deco] vocabulary\\". In January 1987, English Heritage agreed to grant the building listed status, but withdrew this five months later after finding too many original architectural features had been altered. Unigate Dairies, its owners at the time, sold the site, and the building was demolished. ;Lloyds TSB bank, North Street, Brighton (1920s) Another Edwardian Baroque building, this has a distinctive corner turret and moulded pediment, \\"but [is] otherwise conservative\\" with elements of Vernacular architecture. Atlas Chambers are Classical-style offices. ;Atlas Chambers, 33 West Street, Brighton (1930s) Built as offices for an insurance firm, this is one of a series of \\"enervating\\" simplified Classical-style office blocks on the west side of West Street, comprehensively redeveloped in the 1930s due to road widening. ;Hove Manor flats, Hove Street, Hove (1940s) This block of flats was built on the site of the old Hove Manor house, which was demolished in 1936. As originally designed, the brick building had 40 luxury flats, 26 garages at the rear and 10 shops and caf√©s at ground-floor level. ;Barclays Bank, Preston Circus, Brighton A \\"routine\\" exercise in Neo- Georgian architecture, this narrow branch stands between two roads at the major Preston Circus junction. It was squatted in mid-2015 after being vacated by Barclays. =Extensions= ;Royal Albion Hotel, Old Steine, Brighton The hotel was built in 1826, faces inland towards Old Steine and is Grade II*-listed. Clayton & Black's work consisted of \\"ungainly Edwardian embellishments\\" to the rear (sea-facing) elevation, including a lounge. ;Royal Alexandra Hospital, Dyke Road, Brighton The hospital was designed in a distinctive Queen Anne style by Thomas Lainson in 1880‚Äì81, and closed in 2007 when a new building was opened on another site. Many extensions and alterations were made over the years; Clayton & Black built a series of balconies across the main fa√ßade, in the form of a double-height colonnade. Originally open-air, they were later enclosed. ;Brighton College, Eastern Road, Brighton The main building at this \\"lavish\\" Gothic Revival complex dates from 1848 and was designed by George Gilbert Scott. Many other architects added to the ensemble over the decades, and Clayton Black & Daviel were responsible for the extension on the east of the campus accommodating School House in the mid-1960s. =Remodelling= ;Blenheim House, 56 Old Steine, Brighton (1875‚Äì76; Grade II-listed) This is next to Marlborough House and Steine House on the west side of Old Steine, and is taller and set further forward than both. It was built in the early 19th century, but Clayton & Black's work altered its appearance extensively. More changes were made in the early 20th century. The building now has \\"a more Regency character\\" than it did when built. The Theatre Royal was given its present appearance in 1894 when Clayton & Black refronted and extended it. ;Theatre Royal, New Road, Brighton (1894; Grade II*-listed) Opened in 1807, this has been Brighton's main theatre for more than 200 years. A major remodelling in 1866 was followed by Clayton & Black's work, which gave the building its present appearance: they extended and enclosed the conservatory-style fa√ßade, added octagonal corner turrets topped with domes, knocked through to the adjacent house and rebuilt it as a box office and foyer, added Corinthian columns and encased the building in bright red brick. The overall appearance is now Jacobean. Originally listed at Grade II, it was upgraded to Grade II* status in May 2012. ;Wick Hall, Furze Hill, Hove (1902; demolished) This house, whose demolition in 1935 was lamented as an example of \\"Hove's dismal [architectural] record in the 1930s\\", was designed by Decimus Burton between 1833 and 1840. Clayton & Black were commissioned in 1902 by its owner, Alderman Jeremiah Colman, to extend and substantially alter the house. Flats, also called Wick Hall, now occupy the site. ;10 Prince Albert Street, Brighton (1904; Grade II-listed) This thoroughly Georgian-style three-storey red-brick building with a curved fa√ßade was given its present appearance in 1904 when it became Clayton & Black's office. The entrance porch is elaborately Classical, with Tuscan pilasters and a prominent cornice. Inside, the ground floor was completely remodelled; little pre-20th century work remains. ;Temple Heights (New Sussex Hospital), Temple Gardens, Brighton (1921) Like the nearby First Church of Christ Scientist, this was a mid 19th-century stuccoed house altered extensively for its new purpose‚Äîa hospital. The site is now partly occupied by flats built in 2003. ;Locomotive Inn, Terminus Road, Littlehampton (1920s; demolished) This former Kemp Town Brewery pub was next to Littlehampton railway station. Clayton & Black rebuilt it in the late 1920s, but it closed early in the 21st century and was knocked down in June 2013. ;King and Queen pub, Marlborough Place, Brighton (1931‚Äì32; Grade II-listed) Clayton & Black's ostentatious rebuild borrowed freely from Tudor vernacular elements, both standard and decorative: it features jettying, massive timber lintels, corbels in the form of gargoyles, elaborate carvings and a portcullis. The \\"wonderful\\" array of features was enhanced in 1935‚Äì36 when another wing was added. Carvings of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn were added in the gables, although the inn's name originally referred to King George III and Queen Charlotte. =Ecclesiastical work= ;Friends Meeting House, Prince Albert Street, Brighton (1876‚Äì77) This Quaker place of worship was built in 1805 and is Grade II-listed. Some alterations were made in 1850, but Clayton & Black's extensive work of 1876‚Äì77 gave it the Victorian appearance it still retains. They added the north wing, which is recessed and has four windows to each of the two storeys, in a similar style to that of the 1850 section. The former Stoneham Road Baptist Church dates from 1903‚Äì04. ;Mission Hall (Stoneham Road Baptist Church), Lennox Road/Stoneham Road, Hove (1903‚Äì04; demolished 2008) In 1903, the firm was commissioned to design and build a mission hall in the Aldrington area of Hove. It was the initiative of the Sadler family and Rev. David Davies, an early pastor at Holland Road Baptist Church, who wanted to extend that church's reach further west. The red-brick building was extended in 1931 and was given a roughcast exterior, and took the name Stoneham Road Baptist Church. It closed in 2008, when the congregation moved to another church nearby, and was demolished in that year. ;St Thomas the Apostle's Church, Davigdor Road, Hove (1906) The vicar of St Patrick's Church in central Hove got permission in 1899 to erect a tin tabernacle in this rapidly developing residential area, and a gift of land enabled a permanent church to be built. Clayton & Black's design was based on that of St Mary of Eton's Church (1880) in Hackney Wick, London. The building is Early English/Decorated Gothic Revival in style, of red brick and stone with an unaisled nave and a crypt. There is heavy buttressing inside and out. The church was closed in 1993, sold to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and rededicated to St Mary and St Abraam. Clayton & Black converted a house into the First Church of Christ, Scientist in 1921. St Richard of Chichester's Church (1954) is a simple brick hall. ;First Church of Christ, Scientist, Montpelier Road, Brighton (1921) Near Montpelier Terrace in the Montpelier suburb of Brighton, this building was originally a private house‚Äîone of many Italianate/Regency-style houses built in the high-class residential area in the mid-19th century. A \\"notable\\" house, it continued in residential use until Clayton & Black converted it into a church in 1921. They kept many features intact, but gave the building a new stucco fa√ßade topped by a \\"richly decorated pediment\\". The interior is galleried. ;St Richard of Chichester's Church, The Crossway, Hollingdean (1954) After the firm was reconstituted as Clayton, Black and Daviel, it was commissioned by the Diocese of Chichester to design Anglican churches for two of the present city's 20th-century suburbs. In 1954, they built a small brown- brick hall-style church on the Hollingdean estate. St Richard of Chichester's Church was a chapel of ease to the nearby St Matthias' Church. ;Church of the Good Shepherd, Stanley Avenue, Mile Oak (1967) In 1967, the temporary tin church on the Mile Oak estate (opened in 1936) had to be replaced. The firm's architect M.G. Alford, working under the Clayton, Black and Daviel name, designed a distinctive Modernist building: it had a sharply angled roof with six tall windows in the vertical face, and was of brown brick. The Church of the Good Shepherd was parished in 1994, before which it was a chapel of ease to St Nicolas Church, Portslade. ;Miscellaneous restorations Work was undertaken under the firm's name, by various combinations of partners, at the following Anglican churches in Sussex: *St Mary the Virgin Church, Aldingbourne (1889 and 1904) *Holy Trinity Church, Poynings (1897) *Church of the Transfiguration, Pyecombe (1897‚Äì98) *St Andrew's Church, Steyning (1907) *Christ Church, Sayers Common (1975) See also *Buildings and architecture of Brighton and Hove References =Notes= =Bibliography=   * Architecture firms of England Architects from Brighton British companies established in 1876 1876 establishments in England Design companies established in 1876 ","title":"Clayton &amp; Black"},{"id":"34227783","text":"√ìscar Olavarr√≠a Araya (20 August 1951 ‚Äì 27 January 2000) was a Chilean actor, singer and comedian from Santiago.

Jewish communities have been in the forefront of genetic screening and counselling for the disorder.  Impact on Jewish communities  Ashkenazi Jews have been screened as Tay‚ÄìSachs carriers since carrier testing began in 1971. Jewish communities embraced the cause of genetic screening from the 1970s on, and Israel became the first country to offer free genetic screening and counseling for Tay‚ÄìSachs disease and other diseases, leading to discussion about the proper scope of genetic testing. Much awareness of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group stems from genetic studies of disease. Some regard these studies as exhibiting ascertainment bias which created an impression that Jews are more susceptible to genetic disease than other populations. They cite BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations becoming identified as \\"Jewish mutations,\\" despite there being mutations at these loci that are found in all populations. Sheila Rothman and Sherry Brandt-Rauf write: \\"Our findings cast doubt on the accuracy and desirability of linking ethnic groups to genetic disease. Such linkages exaggerate genetic differences among ethnic groups and lead to unequal access to testing and therapy.\\"  Controversy over heterozygote advantage  Neil Risch is the principal author of a study which analyzes the geographic distributions of mutations among Ashkenazi Jews. Risch found \\"compelling support for random genetic drift.\\" Genetic and historical studies of the Ashkenazi population suggest it may have gone through population bottlenecks, thereby giving strong support to the founder effects theory. Because Tay‚ÄìSachs disease was one of the first autosomal recessive genetic disorders for which there was a test, it was intensely studied as a model for all such diseases, and researchers sought evidence of a selective process through a selective advantage for heterozygotes (carriers). Neil Risch writes: \\"The anomalous presence of four different lysosomal storage disorders in the Ashkenazi Jewish population has been the source of long-standing controversy. Many have argued that the low likelihood of four such diseases -- particularly when four are involved in the storage of glycosphingolipids -- must reflect past selective advantage for heterozygous carriers of these conditions.\\" Risch, an eminent statistical geneticist, believes the weight of evidence supports genetic drift, not a selective process. Gregory Cochran proposes that the mutant alleles causing Tay‚ÄìSachs confer higher intelligence when present in carrier form, and provided a selective advantage in the historical period when Jews were restricted to intellectual occupations.

Her unprecedented deep and philosophical style, as well as her controversial personality, marked a before and after in Chilean poetry.  Biography  Stella D√≠az Var√≠n was born into a middle-class family. Her mother was a descendant from a highborn family of french origin which had fallen on hard times. Her father was an anarchist clockmaker who fostered in D√≠az Var√≠n her political ideals. Their economical situation and her father's ideas, together with her passionate readings, moved her since a very young age to write and publish poems and articles in local newspapers. In a public act in 1946 she read a poem in front of the Chilean president Gabriel Gonzalez Videla which was dedicated to him. After this, the President would help her to settle in Santiago, a desire she had been nourishing since her father's death in 1935. D√≠az Var√≠n moved to Santiago in 1947 to study medicine and psychiatry, despite the opposition of both her mother and older brother. Her interest in psychiatry came from her desire to scrutinize the human brain and therefore understand the dreams of humans. During her studies she wrote articles and poems for several newspapers: El Siglo, La Opini√≥n (where she met Vicente Huidobro), El Extra (where she reported crimes in low-income sectors of Santiago) and La Hora. The closing of the newspapers in which she worked forced D√≠az Var√≠n to abandon her studies, which she never completed. President Gonz√°lez Videla, who had won the elections in 1946 with the support of the Communist Party, passed the Law of Permanent Defense of Democracy (Spanish: Ley de Defensa Permanente de la Democracia, N¬∞8.987) which prohibited the existence of the Communist Party in Chile. Its members, D√≠az Var√≠n among them, became persecuted. Based on their mutual aversion toward the government, D√≠az Var√≠n, Enrique Lafourcade and Enrique Lihn tattooed a skull in their shoulders, symbolizing a pact to kill Gonz√°lez Videla, whom they considered a dictator. In 1949, the editor Domingo Morales helps D√≠az Var√≠n to publish her first book: Reason of my Being (Raz√≥n de mi ser). The poems of this volume reflect the vitality and strength of the poet; through suggestive images and an underground language she wrote about death, solitude and recognition of the feminine condition. This poems manifest the intricate relationship between the writer's life and poetical creation. A fictionalized version of D√≠az Var√≠n appears in Alejandro Jodorowsky's autobiographical film Endless Poetry (2016), where she is played by Pamela Flores. Jodorowsky represents her as a Chilean Bukowski and the first punk poetess (probably based on how beat literature has inspired punk and cyberpunk literature).

There may be less than 400 of these tortoises left in the wild. It is found only in the dry forests of the Baly Bay area of northwestern Madagascar, near the town of Soalala (including Baie de Baly National Park).A captive-breeding facility was established in 1986 by the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust (now the Durrell Trust) in collaboration with the Water and Forests Department. In 1996, 75 tortoises were stolen, which later appeared for sale in the Netherlands. The project was ultimately successful, achieving 224 captive-bred juveniles out of 17 adults in 2004. Project Angonoka developed conservation plans that involved local communities making firebreaks, along with the creation of a park to protect the tortoise and the forests. Monitoring of the angonoka tortoise in the global pet trade has also continued to be advocated. Taxonomy This species was originally described in 1885 by French zoologist L√©on Vaillant, who proposed it as the species Testudo yniphora based on the distinguished shape of the anterior part of the plastron. The angonoka tortoise (A. yniphora) and the radiated tortoise (A. radiata) are the only species in the genus Astrochelys. Astrochelys is attributed to John Edward Gray, who used the name in his 1873 book Hand-list of the specimens of shield reptiles in the British Museum. The parent family for Astrochelys is Testudinidae, the tortoise family. The name angonoka comes from the Malagasy word used as the local name of the species. The alternative common name, ploughshare tortoise, refers to the appearance of the gular scute of the plastron. Description The carapace is highly domed and light brown in colour with prominent growth rings on each scute. The outer parts of the vertebral are a darker brown. The gular scute of the plastron projects forward between the front legs and curves upward toward the neck. Males are larger than females, reaching a carapace length up to . The average length of an adult male angonoka tortoise is and the average weight is . Females measure at a average and weigh on average. Distribution and habitat In the wild, this species is only found in Madagascar, where it is endemic to the dry forests in the Baly Bay area of northwestern Madagascar, near the town of Soalala (including Baie de Baly National Park). The distribution is in range around Baly Bay. The Baly Bay region is made up of savanna, mangrove swamps, and dry deciduous forest. They make use of bamboo-scrub habitat which is made up of different types of shrubs, savanna grasses, bamboo, and open areas with no vegetation. The flora includes shrubbery usually under in height, such as Bauhinia and Terminalia species, and Perrierbambus madagascariensis bamboo, which forms dense thickets. The elevation of this area is under above sea level. =Population= The first population surveys of this species were performed by Juvik & Blanc in 1974 and Juvik et al. in 1981, in which they estimated the total wild population to be a few hundred, based on a population density of around five tortoises per km2 and a potential range of approximately in suitable habitat. In 1983 (published 1985) Curl et al. estimated a total population of 100‚Äì400 individuals in a range of , found in five subpopulations, two east and three west of the Andranomavo River. The two to the east were Beheta and Cape Sada; the three to the west were Ambatomainty, Andrafiafaly, and Betainalika. The most accessible and most studied area was on Cape Sada, and numerous surveys in the 1990s estimated a population there of around 30 individuals. In 1999 Smith et al. performed an exhaustive survey of the population on Cape Sada, counting 96 individuals, of which approximately half were adults. They concluded that the Cape Sada population, which was split into 3 subpopulations by Juvik et al. in 1997 on the basis of what they considered suitable habitat, was a single group because the animals utilized the more open habitat in the centre of the Cape and moved from between the three more forested areas. They also concluded the remote Ambatomainty and Andrafiafaly sites were in fact were two ends of an extensive tract of contiguous habitat. Smith et al. did not provide a total population estimate, but based on their research a population of 400‚Äì1500 tortoises could be extrapolated. According to Leuteritz & Pedroso, writing for the IUCN in 2008, estimates of the wild population by Smith et al. in 1999 and Pedroso in 2000 ranged from 440 to 770 (giving an average of around 600). In 2005 the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT), which helps run the main captive breeding program, estimated a wild population of 800 individuals. In 2004 Pedroso used a Population Viability Analysis to predict it would be extinct (in the wild, presumably) by 2014 to 2019. In 2008 Pedroso estimated that his estimate of 440 in 2000 had decreased to 400 (half being adults), and using this estimated decrease, among other factors (such using a population model split into more subpopulations), Leuteritz & Pedroso in 2008 considered it to be critically endangered. In 1986 the DWCT (then known as the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust) established a captive breeding centre at the Ampijoroa in Madagascar, which was able to breed the first captive ploughshare tortoises the following year. In 1997 the Madagascar government created Baie de Baly National Park to conserve to tortoise, and the first five captive-bred tortoises were released back into the wild in the park in 1998 by the DWCT. By 2005 the DWCT release programme had been significantly expanded and by 2011 the first baby tortoises had been born in the wild from captive-bred and released animals. In 2015 20 more animals were released, bringing the total number of released tortoises to 100 at the time. In 2016 poaching intensified, including a foiled attempt to raid the captive breeding centre (a raid in 1996 had 75 tortoises looted). It was estimated in 2016 at a CITES conference that the wild population had dropped to 100 adults and the species would be extinct in the wild by 2018. Ecology and behaviour The angonoka tortoise has been observed feeding on grasses found in open rocky areas of bamboo scrub. It is also known to eat shrubs, forbs, and herbs. While it has been seen eating dead bamboo leaves, it has never been observed eating living bamboo. As well as these plants, the tortoise has also been seen eating the dried feces of bushpigs and carnivores. The introduced bushpig is the main predator of the angonoka tortoise; it eats the tortoises' eggs and young. It is expected to become sexually mature once reaching 15 years old. The tortoise can produce one to six eggs per clutch and up to four clutches every season. The reproductive season is from 15 January to 30 May. The angonoka tortoise's reproductive patterns coincide with the seasonal rainfall patterns of the region, with both mating and hatching occurring at the onset of the rainy seasons. With a 71.9% fertility rate and a 54.6% hatching success rate, about 4.3 hatchlings are produced per female tortoise. In captivity, males must be separated due to aggression towards each other, including ramming, pushing, and overturning with the enlarged gular scute. The aggression is used to establish dominance. Conservation Angonoka tortoise bred in captivity in the Ivato Croc Farm, Antananarivo. This species is one of the rarest land tortoises in the world, classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The principal threats to the species are believed to be fires started to clear land for cattle grazing, and collection for the pet trade. The tortoise has a restricted distribution, likely a result of past collection for food, the expansion of agriculture, and accompanying fires. An additional threat is predation by the bushpig. Fires made to clear land can get out of control, turning into wildfires, which cut back more of the angonoka tortoise's habitat. Following efforts to create firebreaks through controlled fires in savanna fringes by conservation groups, out-of-control fires have decreased, until less than of its habitat were burnt in 2004. Another reason why the Angonoka might go extinct is that the species is concentrated only in one area. They are not dispersed, which means anything such as severe weather and disease could wipe the species out. The angonoka tortoise is often captured to be sold in the international pet trade. Though some enforcement of restrictions on illegal trade is successful, including the confiscation of the illegally obtained tortoises, they remain in incredibly high demand for the global pet trade. This is a major threat to the tortoises remaining in the wild. Conservationists mark the shells with identifying marks which mars the most attractive feature and make them less desirable to poachers and wealthy collectors. The engraving is a last-ditch effort to protect the animals.Hillard, Gloria (27 February 2014) \\"To Save Endangered Tortoises, Conservationists Deface Their Shells\\" National Public RadioDefacing the world's rarest tortoises. BBC Nature. In addition to its Red List listing, the angonoka tortoise is now protected under the national law of Madagascar and listed on CITES Appendix I, commercial trade in wild-caught specimens is illegal (permitted only in exceptional licensed circumstances). For the conservation of the angonoka tortoise, the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust created Project Angonoka in 1986. The Water and Forests Department, the Durrell Trust, and the World Wide Fund for Nature work together on this project. A captive-breeding facility was established for this species in Madagascar in 1986 by the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust (now the Durrell Trust) in collaboration with the Water and Forests Department. In May 1996, 75 tortoises were stolen from the facility. The thieves were never found, but 33 tortoises later appeared for sale in the Netherlands. The project ultimately was a success, achieving 224 captive-bred juveniles out of 17 adults in December 2004. After the 1990s, Project Angonoka started ecological research on the tortoise and the development of conservation plans that involved the communities surrounding the habitat. The work with the community involved local people in making firebreaks, along with the creation of a park proposed by the community to protect the tortoise and the forests. Monitoring of the angonoka tortoise in the global pet trade has continued to be advocated. In March 2013, smugglers were arrested after carrying a single bag containing 54 angonoka tortoises and 21 radiated tortoises (Astrochelys radiata) through Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Thailand. The 54 angonoka tortoises might be as much as a tenth of the world's population of the species. On 20 March 2016, the Custom officials at Mumbai airport seized 146 tortoises from a mishandled baggage of a Nepal citizen. This bag was said to belong to a transit passenger, who arrived from Madagascar and flew to Kathmandu leaving this bag behind. Out of the 146 tortoises, 139 were radiated tortoises (Astrochelys radiata) and seven were angonoka tortoises (Astrochelys yniphora), both critically endangered tortoise species of Madagascar. Two radiated tortoises were found dead with broken shell. On 12 June 2016, it was reported that 6 angonoka tortoises and 72 radiated tortoises had gone missing from a breeding facility in Thailand.

The order deprived those affected of pension entitlements and unemployment benefits accrued prior to their desertion, and prohibited them from employment in the public sector for a period of seven years. Most of those affected had deserted to join the armed forces of belligerents: in almost all cases those of the Allies, and mainly the British Armed Forces. The order was made on 8 August 1945 by √âamon de Valera as Taoiseach in the then Government, using power granted to the government under the Emergency Powers Act 1939 passed on the outbreak of the War. It was revoked with effect from 1 August 1946, a month before the 1939 act lapsed; but it was in effect continued by section 13 of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946. While some deserters had been court-martialled by the time the order was issued, most were abroad: some still on active service, others demobilised but afraid to return. For such people, the order forestalled any court-martial or consequent punishment. The order only applied to members of the Army Reserve or who had enlisted for the duration of the Emergency; pre-war soldiers who deserted remained liable to court-martial.Canny 1999, p.246 Canny lists four motivations for the order: as positive discrimination for those who had remained in the Defence Forces; to deter future desertions; to allow deserters to return to Ireland; and to provide a simpler, cheaper alternative to courts-martial. A list of personnel affected by the order was maintained by the government; it was published in 2011. Bernard Kelly has called the order \\"a highly pragmatic piece of political calculation\\". On 18 October 1945, T. F. O'Higgins proposed in the D√°il, seconded by Patrick McGilligan, that the order be annulled, and dubbed it the starvation order because of the hardship imposed. Richard Mulcahy objected that only enlisted men were covered, not officers.Canny 1999, p.247 Matthew O'Reilly argued the order's penalties were in fact more lenient than those to which deserters would otherwise have been subject under military law. Canny states that in practice those covered by the order were more severely treated than those already arrested and tried. O'Higgins' motion was defeated. The Exchange Telegraph report on the motion was published in many foreign newspapers, causing Joseph Walshe to complain that it gave \\"a mere routine measure of Army administration the character of an act of political vengeance\\". In the 2000s a campaign began for pardons for those who deserted to join the Allied forces. The Defence Forces (Second World War Amnesty and Immunity) Act 2013 provided an amnesty rather than a pardon, because the Constitution of Ireland provides that a pardon can only be granted individually by the President. The amnesty covered 4,634 people affected by the 1945 order or the 1946 act, and about 2,500 others who had been court- martialled or prosecuted in court. Michael Kennedy of the Royal Irish Academy has called for study of the motives and backgrounds of those who deserted, noting that desertion was highest in units near the Irish border.

Among other books, he is author of Teaching with Purpose: An Inquiry into the Who, Why, and How We Teach, A Turning Point in Teacher Education: A Time for Resistance, Reflection and Change (with Jerry Aldridge), and Paulo Freire: The Man from Recife, which is one of the most comprehensive texts in English on the life and thought of Paulo Freire, significantly contributing to Freirean scholarship. Educator Influenced by the work of Paulo Freire and other progressives, Kirylo suggests that education is not a neutral enterprise but a highly charged political affair, largely dictated by the voices that have the most capital power. More often than not, according to Kirylo, these particular voices have propagated a view of education and the notion of school reform as one that has morphed into a language that can be characterized as corporate speak. Kirylo argues there are those who have become so enamored with the convenience of explaining school reform with detached terminology such as outcomes, results, performance, monetary rewards, takeover, competition, and comparing and contrasting that they have created a system analogous to describing a for-profit corporation, resulting in the creation of \\"winners\\" and \\"losers,\\" ultimately fostering what he describes institutionalization of the depersonalization of education. Consequently, in order to ascertain the accuracy of who the winners and losers are, the infrastructure that protects that interest has to be secured. In the end, Kirylo suggests this type of system fosters the objectification of school-aged children, possesses an extraordinarily distorted view of what is educationally important, and largely blames teachers for anything that ails education. Moreover, this type of system has fostered a subtle and not-so-subtle move systematically to deprofessionalize the notion of teacher education and the teaching profession in general, all of which reduces teachers into mechanical functionaries, seriously preventing them from fostering critical thought, innovation, and creativity in actual classroom practice. Not only asserting that to be called an educator is an incredible responsibility and an earned privilege requiring involvement in the political process, Kirylo argues that schooling is a complex affair, suggesting educators collectively unite in challenging systems that propagate a corporate point of view of education. Kirylo has meaningfully contributed to the discourse of critical pedagogy and curriculum theorizing, and its link to liberation theology.

History By 1443, the church and the nearby convent were commissioned and built by the Dominican friars. During the 17th century, a suppression of mendicant orders closed this convent. In 1659 the inhabitants of Soave requested permission from Venetian authorities to take possession of the site, pledging also to celebrate every year one hundred and two masses. In 1871 the convent was sold by the City and later destroyed. The church became a public oratory, which had been maintained by the local parish, who held the catechism and masses for young people. The structure fell into disrepair. In 1985, the Banca Popolare of Verona financed and the comune approved a restoration. Architectural profile The 15th-century building has a simple and sober layout. It was built during an era of transition between Gothic and the Renaissance styles. The shades of different colors, green, ocher and white, alternate and create a particular architectural harmony. The single nave, is illuminated with tall gothic windows. The altar, made in marble, flanked by two little baroque doors. Three other altars are placed in the chapels located on the left wall of the church. The 15th-century chapels have arches in tufa, finely sculptured pilasters, frescoes and colored marbles. The first chapel is dedicated to St Lucy and Apollonia, as evidence of a widespread local devotion. The second chapel is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin of the Rosary. The last was devoted to the crucified Christ. The third chapel must have been owned by two illustrious families, probably from Illasi.

If the capital stock is K_t in one period t, gross (total) investment spending on newly produced capital is I_t and depreciation is D_t, the capital stock in the next period, K_{t+1}, is K_t + I_t - D_t. The net increment to the capital stock is the difference between gross investment and depreciation, and is called net investment. Models In economics, the value of a capital asset may be modeled as the present value of the flow of services the asset will generate in future, appropriately adjusted for uncertainty. Economic depreciation over a given period is the reduction in the remaining value of future goods and services. Under certain circumstances, such as an unanticipated increase in the price of the services generated by an asset or a reduction in the discount rate, its value may increase rather than decline. Depreciation is then negative. Depreciation can alternatively be measured as the change in the market value of capital over a given period: the market price of the capital at the beginning of the period minus its market price at the end of the period. Such a method in calculating depreciation differs from other methods, such as straight-line depreciation in that it is included in the calculation of implicit cost, and thus economic profit. Modeling depreciation of a durable as delivering the same services from purchase until failure, with zero scrap value (rather than slowing degrading and retaining residual value), is referred to as the light bulb model of depreciation, or more colorfully as the one-hoss shay model, after a poem by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., about a carriage which worked perfectly for exactly one hundred years, then fell completely apart in an instant. National accounts Consumption of fixed capital in percent of GDP, Germany, Japan, United States, computed from data of Ameco data base. In national accounts the decline in the aggregate capital stock arising from the use of fixed assets in production is referred to as consumption of fixed capital (CFC). Hence, CFC is equal to the difference between aggregate gross fixed capital formation (gross investment) and net fixed capital formation (net investment) or between Gross National Product and Net National Product. Unlike depreciation in business accounting, CFC in national accounts is, in principle, not a method of allocating the costs of past expenditures on fixed assets over subsequent accounting periods. Rather, fixed assets at a given moment in time are valued according to the remaining benefits to be derived from their use.

Early life He was born of poor parents in the parish of Barnwood, near Gloucester. According to Roger North, he obtained a living and a career in Clement's Inn by importuning the attorneys' clerks. He became a member of the Middle Temple, to which he was admitted on 4 July 1660. He was called to the bar earlier than the custom, on 25 November 1664. Barrister His Reports make it clear that Saunders acquired a large practice at the bar: North says that he was honest, clever and a drinker. In 1680 Saunders defended Anne Price, who was indicted for attempting to suborn one of the witnesses in the Popish Plot; and in the same year he was assigned as counsel for William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford, and the four other Catholic peers accused of high treason. In 1681 he appeared on behalf of the Crown against Edward Fitzharris and Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, both of whom were indicted for high treason. In May 1682 he moved the king's bench for the discharge of Lord Danby, and in the following month he defended William Pain against the charge of writing and publishing letters suggesting that Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey had ‚Äòmurdered himself‚Äô. In November 1682 he was elected a bencher of the Middle Temple. Lord Chief Justice On the institution of the proceedings on quo warranto against the City of London, Saunders, who had advised the proceedings and settled all the pleadings, was appointed Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench in the place of Francis Pemberton, who was moved to Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, because he was supposed to be less favourable to the crown. Saunders was knighted at Whitehall Palace on 21 January 1683, and on the 23rd took his seat in the king's bench court for the first time, having previously been made a serjeant-at-law. The case of the king against the mayor and the commonalty of the city of London was argued before Saunders both in Hilary and in Easter term. On 8 May Saunders presided at the trial of the sheriffs of London and others for a riot at the election of new sheriffs, and succeeded in obtaining a verdict for the Crown. On 19 May he tried Sir Patience Ward for perjury in James, Duke of York's action against Thomas Pilkington. Death On 22 May 1683 Saunders was taken ill while sitting on the bench. The judgment of the court in the quo warranto case was given on 12 June, while Saunders was on his deathbed, by Mr. Justice Jones, who announced that the chief justice agreed with his colleagues in giving judgment for the king and declaring the forfeiture of the charter. In private life he took pleasure in his garden at Parson's Green. He never married. His age was not known, but he was thought not to be much past fifty. Works In 1666 Saunders began his well-known Reports in the King's Bench. They extend from Michaelmas 1666 to Easter 1672, and were first published in 1686, with the records in Latin and the arguments in French.In the second edition, published in 1722, an English translation of the arguments was also given. The third edition, in English, with notes by John Williams, appeared in 1799 and 1802; the fourth, by the same editor, in 1809; the fifth, edited by John Patteson and Edward Vaughan Williams, in 1824; the sixth, by E. V. Williams alone, in 1845. An edition of the Reports was published in Dublin in 1791, and several in America. ‚ÄòNotes to Saunders's Reports, by the late Serjeant Williams, continued to the present time by the Right Hon. Sir E. V. Williams,‚Äô were published in 1871 (London, 2 vols.) Their concision led Lord Mansfield to call him the \\"Terence of reporters\\".

One goal for JSON-LD was to require as little effort as possible from developers to transform their existing JSON to JSON-LD. JSON- LD allows data to be serialized in a way that is similar to traditional JSON., M. Lanthaler and C. G√ºtl in Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on RESTful Design (WS-REST 2012) at WWW2012. It was initially developed by the JSON for Linking Data Community Group before being transferred to the RDF Working GroupRDF Working Group This Working Group ended its activities on 1 July 2014 and is now closed. for review, improvement, and standardization. JSON-LD is a World Wide Web Consortium Recommendation.  Design  JSON-LD is designed around the concept of a \\"context\\" to provide additional mappings from JSON to an RDF model. The context links object properties in a JSON document to concepts in an ontology. In order to map the JSON-LD syntax to RDF, JSON-LD allows values to be coerced to a specified type or to be tagged with a language. A context can be embedded directly in a JSON-LD document or put into a separate file and referenced from different documents (from traditional JSON documents via an HTTP Link header). Example { \\"@context\\": { \\"name\\": \\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name\\", \\"homepage\\": { \\"@id\\": \\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/workplaceHomepage\\", \\"@type\\": \\"@id\\" }, \\"Person\\": \\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person\\" }, \\"@id\\": \\"https://me.example.com\\", \\"@type\\": \\"Person\\", \\"name\\": \\"John Smith\\", \\"homepage\\": \\"https://www.example.com/\\" } The example above describes a person, based on the FOAF vocabulary. First, the two JSON properties \`name\` and \`homepage\` and the type \`Person\` are mapped to concepts in the FOAF vocabulary and the value of the \`homepage\` property is specified to be of the type \`@id\`, i.e., it is specified to be an IRI in the context definition. Based on the RDF model, this allows the person described in the document to be unambiguously identified by an IRI. The use of resolvable IRIs allows RDF documents containing more information to be transcluded which enables clients to discover new data by simply following those links; this principle is known as Follow Your Nose. By having all data semantically annotated as in the example, an RDF processor can identify that the document contains information about a person (\`@type\`) and if the processor understands the FOAF vocabulary it can determine which properties specify the person‚Äôs name and homepage.  Use  The encoding is used by Schema.org, Google Knowledge Graph, and used mostly for search engine optimization activities. It has also been used for applications such as Biomedical Informatics, and representing provenance information. It is also the basis of ActivityStreams, a format for \\"the exchange of information about potential and completed activities\\", and is used in ActivityPub, the federated social networking protocol.

Boulder, CO: Colorado Associated University Press, p. 112. This species is currently considered to be a complex of several varieties and the species is variable in appearance. The varieties can be variable in ploidy level, with diploid, triploid, tetraploid, hexaploid, and others known.Atriplex gardneri. Flora of North America. Retrieved 1-1-2012. Diploid and polyploid individuals may occupy different types of habitat. The varieties intergrade with each other and they can hybridize with each other and with other Atriplex such as Atriplex corrugata. In general, the plant is a shrub or subshrub growing to in height. The stems may be prostrate or upright. The leaves may be oppositely or alternately arranged and they vary in shape and size. They may be green or grayish green in color. The species can be dioecious or monoecious with male and female flower parts located on separate plants or on the same plant. Flower color can vary across the varieties. The plant produces many seeds. The plant reproduces by seed and by resprouting and layering. In one treatment, varieties include: *A. g. var. aptera - Nelson's saltbush, native to the Great Plains. *A. g. var. bonnevillensis - Bonneville saltbush, native to Nevada and Utah *A. g. var. cuneata - Castle Valley saltbush, occurs in Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico *A. g. var. falcata - Jones' saltbush, occurs in the western United States *A. g. var. gardneri - a widespread variety *A. g. var. utahensis - basin saltbush, occurs in the western United States *A. g. var. welshii - Welsh's saltbush, usually occurs with var. cuneata This plant like many other Atriplex is commonly found on salty and alkaline soils. The soils may be clay or sandy. It is a member of several types of saltbush-greasewood plant communities, the two shrub types often occurring together. In some habitats it is a climax species but it also takes hold during secondary succession after a habitat has been disturbed. This species is considered fire-resistant because it is low in flammable oils and high in ash and similar compounds. When it does burn down, the plant grows back quickly by resprouting from its roots. It is sometimes planted in fuelbreaks in California. The leaves of the plant are a fairly nutritious food source for animals including antelope, some rabbit species, and pronghorn. It is an important source of minimum nutritional requirements for ewes (female sheep) undergoing a gestation period. This species blooms from May to August.

The film was directed by John Moore and written by Skip Woods, and stars Bruce Willis as John McClane. The main plot finds McClane travelling to Russia to get his estranged son, Jack, an undercover CIA agent, out of prison. He is soon caught in the crossfire of a global terrorist plot. Alongside Willis, the film also stars Jai Courtney, Cole Hauser, Yulia Snigir and Sebastian Koch. Talks of a fifth Die Hard film began before the release of the fourth installment, Live Free or Die Hard, with Willis affirming that the latter would not be the last in the series, but pre-production did not start until September 2011, when John Moore was officially announced as the director. Filming began in April 2012, primarily in Budapest, Hungary. A Good Day to Die Hard premiered in London on January 31, 2013, coinciding with the unveiling of a Die Hard mural at the Fox Lot, and was released the United States on February 13, 2013. It is the first Die Hard film to use Dolby Atmos Surround Mixing and the first to also be released in IMAX theaters. A Good Day to Die Hard was a box office success but received overwhelmingly negative reviews for its implausible action sequences, cinematography, weak plot, clich√©d screenplay, and lack of characterization, although the special effects were praised. It is the first film produced by TSG Entertainment, since distributor 20th Century Fox's departure from Dune Entertainment upon the completion of their distribution contract at the end of 2012. Plot In Moscow, Viktor Chagarin, a high-ranking, but corrupt, Russian official plans to incriminate former billionaire and government whistleblower Yuri Komarov in an imminent rigged trial unless Komarov hands over a secret file believed to contain evidence incriminating Chagarin. Separately, Jack McClane, who has been arrested after an assassination attempt, negotiates for a shorter sentence by offering to testify against Komarov. Meanwhile, Jack's father, NYPD Detective John McClane, who has not been in touch with his son for several years, has learned his son is in trouble and, taken to the airport by his daughter Lucy McClane, flies to Russia to help. As John arrives and approaches the courthouse where Komarov is on trial, a bomb explosion, orchestrated by Chagarin's henchman Alik, occurs in the courthouse and Jack breaks free with Komarov. Seeing his son, John confronts him, but their dispute is cut short as Alik and his men chase them in an MRAP through the streets of Moscow. John, Jack, and Komarov manage to escape. Hiding in a safe house, John finds out that his son is a CIA agent and has been on an undercover operation for the past three years. Jack's partner, Collins, demands the file's location from Komarov so that the CIA can bring Chagarin down. Komarov eventually agrees on condition that he and his daughter are given safe passage out of Russia. Collins is eventually shot and killed while the McClanes and Komarov come under heavy gunfire from Chagarin's men, but they escape. They make their way to a hotel in the city to fetch the key to the safe-deposit box containing the file. There they meet up with Komarov's daughter, Irina, as earlier planned. John grows suspicious of her shifty behavior, and is proven correct when Alik and his men burst in and tie John and Jack up, while Komarov is taken as a hostage, and Irina confesses to informing on them for the \\"millions of dollars\\" to be gained. Jack breaks free of his ties and kills the nearest guards using a Russian gun-knife, allowing the two to kill most of the men. Alik and Irina, with Komarov still their hostage, return in a Mil Mi-24 helicopter and try to kill them, but the two escape a second time. That night, the two steal a car full of firearms and drive to Pripyat, Ukraine, where the safe-deposit box with the file is located. However, Komarov, Irina, and Alik have preceded them. In a twist, the file is revealed never to have existed: the safe-deposit box with the file supposedly inside is, in fact, a secret passage to a Chernobyl-era vault containing ‚Ç¨1 billion worth of weapons-grade uranium. Once inside the vault, Komarov kills Alik and calls Chagarin to gloat and to listen as Chagarin is killed by a henchman of Komarov's. At this point, John and Jack enter the vault, discover Komarov's true plot, and capture him. Irina, with another henchman, comes to her father's aid. As they attempt to escape, Jack follows Komarov, while John goes after Irina, who is escaping on a Mil Mi-26 helicopter. Irina tries to protect her father by firing the helicopter's guns at Jack. John is able to bring the helicopter out of balance by driving a truck out of the hangar section, still shackled by a chain, via the open rear ramp; he is later thrown off into the building. Komarov remarks that Jack will get to watch his father die, prompting Jack to hurl him off the rooftop into the path of the spinning helicopter rotors, killing him. As Jack and John reunite inside the building, Irina tries to avenge her father by ramming the helicopter, now out of ammunition, into the building in a suicide attack. John and Jack survive by leaping off the building into a large pool of water, as the helicopter crashes and explodes, killing Irina. In the end, the McClanes return home and reunite with Lucy on the tarmac.

This was never confirmed by the studio, and the film's title was later revealed to be A Good Day to Die Hard‚Äîwith no further mention of any involvement from the 24 series‚Äîwith a release date of February 14, 2013. =Casting= Bruce Willis returned as John McClane, and has expressed a desire to shoot A Good Day to Die Hard and a sixth installment in the series before retiring the character. When casting the role of Jack McClane, the studios considered several actors, including Liam Hemsworth and James Badge Dale, before ultimately settling on Australian actor Jai Courtney. Mary Elizabeth Winstead also appeared in the film, reprising her role as McClane's daughter Lucy. However all her scenes were cut from the Extended release. Sebastian Koch played the film's primary antagonist, Yuri Komarov, while Yulia Snigir and Cole Hauser featured as secondary characters Irina and Collins. The cast was completed by actors Amaury Nolasco as a friend of McClane, Pasha D. Lychnikoff as a taxi driver, and Megalyn Echikunwoke, Anne Vyalitsyna, and Ivan Kamaras in smaller roles. =Filming= Production began in Hungary in April 2012, with the capital Budapest standing in for Moscow. A military shooting range near Hajm√°sk√©r was used for shooting live ammunition, while vehicular stunts were shot at the Hungaroring, a Formula One racing circuit in Mogyor√≥d. In July 2012, a fire broke out on the set while shooting an aerial stunt, though no one was injured and shooting resumed after a short delay. In creating the film's visual style, Moore wanted the camera work to be almost entirely handheld, using three 4 Perforation 35mm Arri cameras equipped with long lenses to capture tight close-ups, for Moore explained, \\"McClane is in a strange world, with little or no initial control over his environment. He's unable to anticipate things as he normally might. He's caught off guard, and we want the camera to mimic that surprise and confusion.\\" Moore also chose to create as many of the film's effects on camera as possible, only using visual effects to enhance elements or paint in backgrounds. =Post- production= A specially censored version was prepared for theatrical release in the United Kingdom, which was cut for language and violence in order to attain a 12A at the request of the distributors. The U.S. version is rated R and is uncut. The film's audio was mixed in Dolby Atmos surround sound. In February 2013, director Moore began work on a director's cut, which was later released on Blu-ray. Soundtrack Marco Beltrami, who had composed the soundtrack for the previous film, Live Free or Die Hard, returned to score A Good Day to Die Hard. Beltrami again incorporates Michael Kamen's material from the first three films into his score. Beltrami only had six weeks in which to write the music, and new scenes were still being shot as the music was being recorded. In the end, he wrote around 120 minutes of music, with 80 of those minutes making it into the final film. The soundtrack album was released on February 14, 2013 digitally and in retailers by Sony Classical. Five orchestrators were involved: Pete Anthony, Jon Kull, Dana Niu, Rossana Galante, Andrew Kinny. The orchestra was conducted by Pete Anthony. The score was programmed by Buck Sanders, with additional music composed by Marcus Trumpp and Brandon Roberts.

On January 31, 2013, 20th Century Fox held a special tribute to the 25th anniversary of the Die Hard series by unveiling a mural of a scene from Die Hard (1988) on Sound Stage 8 of the Fox Lot. Afterward, the premiere screening of A Good Day to Die Hard was shown. Two additional premieres were held in Europe leading up to the film's commercial release: one in Berlin, Germany on February 4 and the second in London, England on February 7. A Good Day to Die Hard was commercially released first in Indonesia on February 6, 2013, and then opened in certain East and Southeast Asian territories on February 7. In the United States and Canada, the film was distributed to 2,328 theaters for night showings on February 13. Select theaters also held a one-time special marathon of all Die Hard films to lead up to A Good Day to Die Hard's nationwide release, with Bruce Willis making a personal appearance at one of these marathons in New York City to thank fans. The film then expanded to a total of 3,553 theaters, including IMAX theaters, on February 14. Reception A Good Day to Die Hard was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 15% based on 226 reviews, with an average rating of 3.94/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"A Good Day to Die Hard is the weakest entry in a storied franchise, and not even Bruce Willis' smirking demeanor can enliven a clich√©d, uninspired script.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 28 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". On both websites, the film ranked lowest among the Die Hard films. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale, the lowest score of the franchise. A. O. Scott of The New York Times described A Good Day to Die Hard as \\"a handful of extended set pieces‚Äîeach more elaborate and therefore somehow less exciting than the last‚Äîlinked by a simple-minded plot and a handful of half-clever lines.\\" Though complimenting the special effects, he criticizes the direction of John Moore, the lack of style, and writes that \\"everything that made the first Die Hard memorable‚Äîthe nuances of character, the political subtext, the cowboy wit‚Äîhas been dumbed down or scrubbed away entirely.\\" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter expressed similar sentiments, particularly of the direction, for which he says that Moore \\"has directed these sequences in a way that makes the incidents look so far-fetched and essentially unsurvivable that you can only laugh\\". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a 2/5 and remarked that it lacked \\"inspiration\\", and that the onscreen rivalry of Willis and Courtney was \\"more irritant than enticement.\\" Richard Roeper, standing in for Roger Ebert on Ebert's website, rated the film one and a half stars out of four, criticizing the implausibility of the action sequences, as well as the film's lack of sufficient characterization for McClane and the villains as compared to the other films in the series. He says that \\"McClane has been stripped of any real traces of an actual three-dimensional character,\\" and that the film \\"never giv[es] us a chance to get the least bit involved with any of these characters.\\" Among the rare positive reviews, Robbie Collin for The Daily Telegraph remarked that \\"Yet even though the ride finally stalls, A Good Day To Die Hard has been thrustingly outrageous enough in its earlier moments to coast to the finish line on momentum.\\". Daniel M. Kimmel, writing for the New England Movies Weekly, found the film to be better than Live Free or Die Hard and states that the car chase scene \\"is well worth the price of admission.\\" With a 3.5/5 rating, Kimmel summed up his review saying, \\"it's probably a good day to end the series at last, but it's an action-packed and entertaining finale.\\" Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail criticized the action scenes as being \\"messy\\", but concluded his review saying that the film \\"continues the franchise without undue embarrassment.\\" Peter Howell of The Toronto Star remarked that Willis and Courtney made a strong estranged family duo and that the film had a nice drinking game routine going for it with how many times McClane exclaims \\"I'm on vacation!\\" during the running time. =Box office= A Good Day to Die Hard grossed $67,349,198 in North America and $237,304,984 in other territories for a worldwide total of $304,654,182, collecting more than three times its $92 million budget. In North America, A Good Day to Die Hard grossed an estimated $840,000 from its night showings at 2,328 locations on Wednesday, February 13, 2013. The next day, at an additional 1,225 locations, the film managed to accumulate $8,239,116, opening at #2 behind Safe Haven. However, for the whole 4-day Presidents' Day weekend, A Good Day to Die Hard opened in first place with $28,640,657, bringing its total at that point to $36,879,773. Overseas, A Good Day to Die Hard grossed $10,860,000 in its first weekend. Opening in seven Asian markets at 1,182 locations a week before North America's release (February 6‚Äì7) to take advantage of the Chinese New Year holiday, the majority of the film's gross came from South Korea, with the film also setting a Fox record in Indonesia and a series record in Hong Kong. =Home media= A Good Day to Die Hard was released on DVD and Blu-ray on June 4, 2013. There is an extended cut that is only available on the Blu- ray version. It features a longer car chase through Moscow and some other slightly extended scenes. It also completely removes Lucy from the film. Cancelled sequel and prequel television series When the production was formally announced for the fifth film in the series, Bruce Willis expressed his desire to retire the John McClane character in a sixth and final film. By September 2017, director Len Wiseman publicly floated that he was casting for a young version of John McClane for his self-penned origin story called John McClane, whose plot was rumored to borrow heavily from the Die Hard: Year One comic book mini-series. Six months later, the studio enlisted duo Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes to re-write the screenplay after Bruce Willis refused to endorse the previous edition and its actor. In July 2018, producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura submitted an updated treatment titled McClane, further confirming that the storyline features elements of McClane's and Holly's characters in the 1970s, intermixed with their present-day counterparts. The following month, Wiseman stated that pre-production on the new film should start \\"...fairly soon, no dates\\" once the script has been completed. Tobey Maguire joined the production team late Summer 2018. By December 2018, di Bonaventura handed in yet another draft, this time without input from Willis. Production designer Carol Uraneck, who was hired in September 2018, later left the project by the close of the year. In February 2019, the production team made a revision to the writing, insinuating that the project, though supposedly moving forward, is on the studio's backburner, as evidenced by executives not even having read the script yet. Actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead said that she would be interested in returning as Lucy Gennero-McClane in a future installment, but later intimated doubt that, due to scheduling, if the film would ever get made. Die Hard was removed from the Fox imprint through at least its 2021 slate, after Disney's acquisition and senior management shake- up, which saw the dismissal of its theatrical distribution executive, Chris Aronson. The production was later cancelled outright in August 2019 after further consideration by Disney. In lieu of the reorganization of both companies, the media giant is said to be rebooting development of McClane for streaming as a television series.

The coffee shop was built in 1965 as part of the National Park Service's Mission 66 program to upgrade visitor facilities, in order to increase visitor dining capacity. Under the Mission 66 projects, visitor facilities were usually comprehensive in nature, providing a range of visitor services. Specialized concession buildings like the Coffee Shop were unusual in Mission 66. It was leased to the Glacier Park Company for operation, in anticipation of the construction of lodging facilities by the company. The Coffee Shop was designed by Burt L. Gewalt of the Kalispell, Montana architectural firm of Brinkman and Lenon. Gewalt designed the roofline to echo individual design elements of the nearby Lake McDonald Lodge, using compatible paint and trim materials. Description The Coffee House is located a little to the east of the Lake McDonald Lodge, between the Lodge and the Going-to-the-Sun Road. The by rectangular one-story shop is set on a small hill, surrounded by a lawn with mature conifers shading the site. The building is clad in white stucco over plywood and battened cedar panels. The roof structure is composed of glued laminated timber frames on steel columns, supporting a modified hipped roof. The roof is the building's most significant detail, with clipped ends to echo the main lodge structure, and a louvered roof monitor along the ridge, designed to conceal ventilation equipment in an open roof well. The present monitor has been modified from the original cap structure, which did not cope well with the heavy snow loads at the site. The eaves extend from the building at either end. The stucco panels near the entrance feature metal sculpture designed by Gewalt to express the surrounding mountains. The interior is arranged with the main dining room in the north end, the kitchen in the middle, and the employees' dining room at the south end. A lunch counter was originally located next to the main entrance near the center of the building. The employees' dining room has been converted to office and storage use. Interior finishes were stained cedar batten panels and vinyl asbestos tile, with an open ceiling space. Original light fixtures by A.W. Pistol remain. Gewalt drew his design inspiration from the lodge building and from Welton Becket's design for the Canyon Village Lodge at Yellowstone National Park. Gewalt's design has been compared to the \\"Coffee Shop Modern\\" style by author Alan Hess, using many of the same structural effects and transparent design elements, as well as conspicuously modern design features. Hess describes Coffee Shop Modern as an offshoot of Googie architecture. Interior of the Coffee Shop with original light fixtures Architects and contractors Brinkman and Lenon was founded shortly after World War II, continuing after the death of the founding partners in 1961 until the firm was sold to the Architects Design Group in the 1990s. The firm designed the Logan Pass Visitor Center and the Saint Mary Visitor Center, Entrance Station and Checking Stations at the eastern side of the park as well as other structures at West Glacier, Saint Mary and Rising Sun. The shop was built by the Collins Construction Company of Kalispell at a cost of about $107,000. Master plan The Coffee Shop was to be the first element in expansion of the Lake McDonald site with additional visitor services. The Mission 66 plan for Lake McDonald in 1955 envisioned the removal of all structures in the area except for the lodge itself and the construction of a series of one and two-story lodging units with 20 to 70 rooms each. These plans were scaled back, and were further reduced after the Great Northern Railway, which at the time owned the Glacier Park Company, objected to the plans as too costly. The Great Northern sold their Glacier Park operations to Glacier Park, Inc., operated by Don Hummell. By 1963 plans had been reduced to the construction of a \\"grill\\" at the site. Historic designation The Lake McDonald Coffee Shop was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 14, 2008, before the usual 50-year anniversary requirement for NRHP properties, in recognition of its status as an exceptional example of Mission 66 design. Until its designation it was considered a non-contributing structure in the Lake McDonald Lodge Historic District.

In an editorial criticizing the attempt to remove the proposed Holocaust gallery from the museum, she stated, \\"the problem with the CMHR is it is mired in the politics of Canadian ethnic identity rather than rooted in the scholarly study of genocide, Holocaust, and human rights.

The game was played on January 14, 1996 at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, home of the Pittsburgh Steelers, who hosted the Indianapolis Colts for the chance to play the winner of the National Football Conference in Super Bowl XXX in Tempe, Arizona. While it was considered a mismatch between an expected Super Bowl contender (Pittsburgh) and a Cinderella team (Indianapolis) in the week leading up to the game, it turned out to be very competitive, going down to the last play of the game when Colts quarterback Jim Harbaugh threw a Hail Mary pass that was ruled a dropped pass by officials in the end zone by the intended receiver, Aaron Bailey. The dropped pass gave the Steelers a 20‚Äì16 victory and sent them to Super Bowl XXX, the team's first Super Bowl appearance since Super Bowl XIV sixteen years earlier. The game would mark a turning point for both franchises. For Steelers head coach Bill Cowher, it would be the first of only two times the Steelers would advance to the Super Bowl during his 15-year tenure at home, as the team would host the AFC Championship Game five times between 1994 and 2004 but would lose nearly all of them, with the 1995 game being the one exception. For the Colts, it marked an unexpected period of success in the mid-1990s for a franchise that otherwise struggled between its 1984 move to Indianapolis (as well as the team's last few years in Baltimore before that) and the team drafting Peyton Manning with the number one overall pick in the 1998 NFL Draft. The game has been ranked among the best Conference Championship games in the history of the National Football League by several publications, including Sports Illustrated, ESPN,http://www.livedash.com/transcript/nfl%27s_greatest_games-%281995_afc_championship__indianapolis_colts_at_pittsburgh_steelers%29/3672/ESPN2/Friday_January_15_2010/167161/ AOL,http://www.aolnews.com/2007/01/16/cowhers-greatest-games-no-2-1995-season- steelers-colts-afc-c/ and several local publications throughout the United States. NFL Films would go on to feature the game in both its ongoing NFL Films Game of the Week and NFL's Greatest Games series. Background Entering the 1995 NFL season, the Pittsburgh Steelers were expected to compete for the AFC Central title and a trip to the Super Bowl following a 12‚Äì4 regular season the year before behind its \\"Blitzburgh\\" defense that saw the team upset by the San Diego Chargers 17‚Äì13 in the 1994 AFC Championship Game. However, the team got off to a slow start, starting the 1995 season at 3‚Äì4 before ripping through the NFL on an eight-game winning streak. The team's last regular season loss was in Week 17 against the Green Bay Packers, 24‚Äì19 at Lambeau Field, a game that had no playoff implications since both teams had already clinched their respective playoff seedings entering the game. The Steelers' 11‚Äì5 record was good enough for the AFC Central Division championship (four games ahead of the Cincinnati Bengals and Houston Oilers) and the conference's number 2 seed, earning a first-round bye in the playoffs. The Colts were coming off an 8‚Äì8 season in 1994 that was the team's best record since 1987, when the team won the AFC East with a 9‚Äì6 record during the strike-shortened season. Aside from the 1987 season, the Colts had not appeared in the playoffs since 1977 when the team was in Baltimore. Behind veteran quarterback Jim Harbaugh, the 1995 season would change that, as several come-from-behind victories propelled the team to a 9‚Äì7 record and the number 5 seed in the AFC playoffs. When the playoffs started, the Steelers defeated the Buffalo Bills 40‚Äì21 in the Divisional round to advance to their second consecutive AFC Championship Game. Meanwhile, the Colts defeated the defending AFC champion San Diego Chargers 35‚Äì20 at Jack Murphy Stadium, then pulled off the upset by defeating the top-seeded Kansas City Chiefs 10‚Äì7 at Arrowhead Stadium. The upset of the Chiefs meant that the AFC Championship Game would be a home game for the Steelers instead of traveling to Kansas City for the AFC Championship Game. The upset also marked the Colts' first AFC Championship Game appearance in 24 years, since the then-Baltimore Colts lost to the Miami Dolphins 21‚Äì0 in 1971. The Colts were the first number 5 seed to advance to a conference championship game since the 1990 playoff expansion. It would mark the first time since the 1970 merger that no team that was a member of the American Football League at any point in its history participated in the AFC Championship Game, as both the Colts and Steelers were with the \\"old\\" NFL before moving to the newly formed AFC in 1970 to even out the two conferences. (Since then, only the 2008 AFC Championship Game between the Steelers and their archrivals, the Baltimore Ravens, has the AFC title been played for between two non-AFL teams.) The game was a rematch of the Week 3 contest between the two teams from the previous season, which the Steelers won at home, 31‚Äì21. The 1995 AFC Championship Game would be the second of four consecutive seasons in which the two teams met in Pittsburgh, an uncommon sight for non-division rivals. Game summary On the Steelers opening drive, Neil O'Donnell's first pass of the game was tipped by defensive tackle Tony Siragusa and intercepted by Jeff Herrod, who returned it to the Pittsburgh 24-yard line. But the Colts drive was halted when Ray Seals tackled running back Lamont Warren for a loss on third down and one. On the next play, Cary Blanchard hit the right upright on his 34-yard field goal, but it still bounced in and the Colts took a 3‚Äì0 lead. After each team punted, Pittsburgh's Norm Johnson kicked a field goal to even the game with under two minutes remaining in the first quarter. The field goal occurred after Kordell Stewart dropped a pass in the end zone. Replays showed Colts safety Jason Belser made contact with Stewart just before the ball arrived, but no penalty flag was thrown. In the second quarter, a 30-yard reception by Colts receiver Sean Dawkins set up Blanchard's second field goal. But later on, Pittsburgh drove 80 yards in 17 plays, featuring three third down conversion runs by Kordell Stewart, and scored on O'Donnell's 5-yard third and goal touchdown pass to Stewart with 13 seconds left in the half, making the score 10‚Äì6. Replays showed Stewart had put half a foot out of bounds before making the catch, which would have made him an ineligible receiver, but the penalty was not called. As it was during the seven-year period when the NFL didn't implement instant replay, the play could not be challenged and reversed. On Indianapolis' first drive of the second half, they drove 61 yards in nine plays, featuring a 29-yard completion from Jim Harbaugh to tight end Ken Dilger. Blanchard finished the drive with his third field goal to cut their deficit to 10‚Äì9. Then after forcing a three and punt, Indy drove 35 yards in nine plays to set up another field goal try, which would have put the Colts up 12‚Äì10. But this time Blanchard's 47-yard attempt sailed wide right. Taking over on their own 37, Pittsburgh mounted a drive in Colts territory where Johnson's 37-yard field goal put them back up by four points, at 13‚Äì9. Early in the fourth quarter, a long punt return by Steelers receiver Andre Hastings gave them the ball at midfield. But all they got out of their great field position was a missed field goal. After that, Harbaugh threw a 47-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Floyd Turner to take the lead, 16‚Äì13. After a Steelers punt, their defense got a big chance when Warren fumbled deep in Colts territory, but guard Joe Staysniak recovered the ball in mid-air to keep the drive going. Later on, defensive back Willie Williams tackled Warren behind the line on third down and one to force a punt, giving Pittsburgh the ball back with 3:03 left in the game. Pittsburgh then marched 67 yards to score the winning touchdown. Running back Byron Bam Morris scored the game- winning 1-yard touchdown run with 1:34 remaining in the game to pull Pittsburgh ahead for good. The drive was aided by O'Donnell's 9-yard completion to Hastings on fourth down and 3 from the 47-yard line, as well as an earlier dropped potential interception that went in and out of the arms of linebacker Quentin Coryatt. On the next play after Hastings' fourth down conversion catch, O'Donnell completed a 37-yard pass to Ernie Mills on the Indianapolis 1-yard line, setting up Morris' 1-yard scoring run. The Colts got the ball back and advanced to the Steelers' 29 with 5 seconds left, narrowly avoiding a turnover when defensive back Chris Oldham dropped a wide open interception. On the game's final play, Harbaugh attempted a hail mary pass which he lofted high and came down into a crowd of players in the end zone, the ball momentarily was against Colts' Aaron Bailey's chest but it hit the turf before he could haul it in. Harbaugh completed 21 of 33 passes for 267 yards and a touchdown. Aftermath The missed call on Kordell Stewart's touchdown catch in the second quarter brought some debate following the game on whether or not the league should bring back instant replay, which had been repealed in 1992. Replays at the time demonstrated that there would have been enough evidence to reverse the call and penalize Stewart for an illegal touching foul (stepping out of bounds before catching the pass). Jim Harbaugh later stated in postgame interviews that the missed call on Stewart and the missed pass interference call on Jason Belser that could have led to a Pittsburgh touchdown instead of a field goal were a \\"wash\\". Despite this game, there was no real desire by league owners to reinstate instant replay for 1996. Instant replay would eventually return for the 1999 NFL season, and has since been made a permanent addition of the NFL rules. The game would mark the only home AFC Championship Game in Bill Cowher's 15-year tenure that the Steelers won, having advanced to the game at home in 1994, 1995, 1997, 2001, and 2004. Except for the 1995 game‚Äîwhich the Steelers almost lost‚Äîthe other home matchups would be losses. Ironically, the only time the team played for the AFC title on the road during Cowher's tenure, the 2005 matchup against the Denver Broncos at Invesco Field at Mile High, would be the only AFC Championship Game the Steelers won decisively during Cowher's tenure, winning 34‚Äì17. It would also be the only year in which the Steelers won the Super Bowl with Cowher as their head coach, defeating the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XL 21‚Äì10. The game would be the last game for Ted Marchibroda in his second stint as the Colts head coach, having coached the Colts from 1975 to 1979 when the team was in Baltimore. Following the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, the newly christened Baltimore Ravens hired Marchibroda to be their inaugural head coach. Following him to Baltimore would be ex-Colts Floyd Turner (whose number 88 in Indianapolis would be immediately picked up by Marvin Harrison, who would spend the next 13 years with the Colts) and former University of Pittsburgh standout Tony Siragusa; Siragusa would later pick up a Super Bowl ring when the Ravens won Super Bowl XXXV. Marchibroda would be fired after the 1998 season and returned to the Colts as a color commentator for their radio network until retiring following the Colts victory in Super Bowl XLI at the end of the 2006 NFL season, after which he became a pre-game commentator for the Colts for a time before Marchibroda's death in January 2016. A native of Franklin, Pennsylvania north of Pittsburgh, Marchibroda's last game as Colts head coach actually came in his hometown, with Marchibroda having played quarterback for the Steelers in the 1950s. Coincidentally, the Steelers infamously kept Marchibroda over future Colts star Johnny Unitas one year during training camp. The Steelers would play the Dallas Cowboys two weeks later in Super Bowl XXX, renewing the rivalry the two teams had in the 1970s, when the two teams were among the most dominant teams in the NFL. The heavily favored Cowboys would defeat the Steelers 27‚Äì17. The Colts and Steelers would both make the playoffs in 1996, with the Steelers defeating the Colts 42‚Äì14 in the Wild Card round. The following year, the two teams met for the fourth consecutive year in Pittsburgh in Week 7, in which the Steelers defeated the struggling Colts 24‚Äì22, dropping the Colts to 0‚Äì6 en route to a 3‚Äì13 season and the team drafting Peyton Manning first overall in the 1998 NFL Draft. The four consecutive losses in Pittsburgh would be part of a longer losing streak for the Colts, who after defeating the Steelers 41‚Äì7 at Pitt Stadium in 1968 lost 12 straight games against the Steelers in Pittsburgh before breaking through with a 24‚Äì20 win at Heinz Field in 2008. The Colts finished 0‚Äì11 lifetime at Three Rivers Stadium. Jim Harbaugh, who after retiring worked his way up to being an NFL head coach himself with the San Francisco 49ers, has stated that the 1995 AFC Championship Game continues to haunt him: \\"Coming that close to your dream of participating in the Super Bowl, and then seeing it brush by your face in an instant, and you walk off the field and you go 'there will be other days'. And then you realize it was the only day.\\" Harbaugh would eventually reach the Super Bowl with the 49ers, only to lose Super Bowl XLVII to the Baltimore Ravens, coached by his brother John Harbaugh.

It seems to have been worn by both men and women, and was particularly a fashion of the mid-1st to early 2nd century AD.Matthew B. Roller, Dining Posture in Ancient Rome: Bodies, Values, and Status (Princeton University Press, 2006), p. 34. More is known about the etiquette of wearing the synthesis than its appearance. It is mentioned mainly by Martial,Martial, Epigram 5.79, 14.1.1 (see also CIL VI. 2068.8), as cited by Roller, Dining Posture in Ancient Rome, p. 34; Ethel Hampson Brewster, \\"The Synthesis of the Romans,\\" Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 49 (1918), p. 131. who also uses the word cenatoria.Martial, Epigrams 10.87.12, 14.136 (so too Petronius, 21.5 and 56.9), as cited by Roller, Dining Posture in Ancient Rome, p. 34. This attire was characteristically colorful, but lacking further description in ancient literature or a secure identification of the synthesis in art, scholars have viewed it variously as an ensemble or suit, or a single garment that was a sort of robe or tunic- mantle combination.Brewster, \\"The Synthesis of the Romans,\\" pp. 137‚Äì138. The synthesis was part of the urbanite's wardrobe, and fashionable Romans might own several.Brewster, \\"The Synthesis of the Romans,\\" p. 132, citing Martial 2.46 and 5.79. The garment might be conspicuously expensive, and Martial mentions one of his friends giving a fine synthesis to his mistress on the occasion of the Matronalia.Brewster, \\"The Synthesis of the Romans,\\" p. 133, citing Martial 10.29.3‚Äì6. Residents of the municipalities would have rare occasion to wear the synthesis.Brewster, \\"The Synthesis of the Romans,\\" p. 131. The toga, the Roman male citizen's characteristic garment, was cumbersome and considered inappropriate for reclining at dinner. At the same time, exposing too much flesh at dinner was offensive to Romans; funerary dining scenes in Roman art showing bare torsos have a symbolic or religious meaning.Roller, Dining Posture in Ancient Rome, p. 34. The synthesis was a colorful alternative for private leisure, and wearing it in everyday public life was a faux pas. It could be worn during the day in public only during the Saturnalia, the December festival during which social norms were turned topsy- turvy.Brewster, \\"The Synthesis of the Romans,\\" p. 132. Martial treats the wearing of the synthesis as characteristic of the holiday, as was the wearing of the \\"cap of freedom\\" (pilleus).Martial 14.1.1‚Äì2. It may originally have been women's clothing, adopted by men as part of the holiday's role reversals. Brewster, \\"The Synthesis of the Romans,\\" p. 141. The emperor Nero was criticized for choosing a loose-belted synthesis as everyday attire.Suetonius, Life of Nero 51; Brewster, \\"The Synthesis of the Romans,\\" p. 132. The priesthood of the Arval Brothers wore a white version of the garment at their ceremonial banquets.Brewster, \\"The Synthesis of the Romans,\\" p. 132, citing the Acta fratrum Arvalium and inscriptions.

The group consisted of Mad Caddies frontman Chuck Robertson, Caddies members Graham Palmer and Todd Rosenberg, and then-future Caddies member and former Cherry Poppin' Daddies keyboardist Dustin Lanker. Biography Ellwood formed when Robertson relocated back to his hometown of Solvang, California in the late 2000s. After reconnecting with Palmer and Rosenberg, and finding the Santa Ynez Valley music scene lacking, the trio decided to form a new band just for fun, eventually recruiting longtime Caddies touring keyboardist Dustin Lanker. In contrast to the more punk rock and ska punk sound of the Mad Caddies, Ellwood focused more on sunny, mellow and mid-tempo ska and reggae. In 2010, after a period of playing local shows, Ellwood chose to move forward and record an album. Spending six months putting together material, the group demoed an album in Palmer's garage, then recorded it in a Santa Barbara studio in only two days. After putting Ellwood on hold for almost a year to focus on the Mad Caddies, Robertson eventually passed a copy of the album onto Fat Mike at a party, who called Robertson several days later and agreed to put it out on Fat Wreck Chords. Lost in Transition was released on June 21, 2011, meeting with positive critical reviews from the likes of Alternative Press, PopMatters and Punknews.org. In promotion of the album, Ellwood carried out a headlining tour of Europe in November and December 2011, followed in January 2012 by a West coast United States tour supporting NOFX and Old Man Markley. Shortly after the release of Lost in Transition, Robertson stated that Ellwood was already working on new material for their next album, noting that the music would be a drastic departure from their debut, dabbling in \\"heavy, aggressive, poppy rock\\". According to Robertson, \\"The plan for Ellwood is really to just take it record by record, and whatever the theme we want to go for, just go for it....[w]e're just going to keep expanding, and not be a band that's chained to one sound or style\\". Robertson also noted that the band hoped to complete five records in five years. In an update posted to Facebook on November 1, 2012, the band confirmed that work had begun on a second studio album, though Ellwood would be \\"put in the freezer for a little while\\" as Robertson returned to writing and touring with the Caddies. After years of inactivity, however, Robertson finally confirmed in an October 2020 interview that Ellwood was officially \\"defunct\\", largely crediting the band's demise on their choice of name: he recalled certain shows on the band's 2011 European tour only drawing significant attendance when they were heavily advertised as being a Mad Caddies side project, otherwise \\"no one bought the fucking Ellwood record and no one would come to the shows or anything\\". Robertson revealed he had since been writing new solo material which he planned to release under his own name.

Background Lewis-Williams first published some of the ideas that would form the basis for his argument in The Mind in the Cave in a 1988 academic paper co-written with Thomas Dowson entitled \\"The Signs of All Times: Entoptic Phenomena in Upper Palaeolithic Art\\" Fellow archaeologist Robert J. Wallis would later characterise this as \\"one of the most controversial papers\\" in rock art research.Wallis 2004. p. 357 Synopsis Lewis-Williams opens The Mind in the Cave with a preface, in which he outlines the methodology that he is working with, and emphasises his position that \\"we do not have to explain everything to explain something\\".Lewis-Williams. pp. 1-11. what he calls \\"Three Caves: Three Time- Bytes\\", brief page-long narratives set in the Upper Palaeolithic sites of the Volp Caves, the Niaux Cave and Chauvet Cave.Lewis-Williams 2005. pp. 12-17. In the first chapter, entitled \\"Discovering Human Antiquity\\", Lewis-Williams explores the early scholarly understanding of Upper Palaeolithic art, stemming from the increased interest in the origins of the human species sparked by the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. He proceeds to discuss early attempts to analyse both portable and parietal art, and the early belief that cave paintings were forgeries, being too sophisticated to have been produced by \\"primitive\\" humans, before scholars eventually came to accept their authenticity. Finally, he notes the developments in radiocarbon dating, which enabled far more accurate dating of archaeological sites, allowing scholars to appreciate the exact antiquity of the Upper Palaeolithic.Lewis-Williams 2005. pp. 18-40. Chapter two, \\"Seeking Answers\\", proceeds to examine the various different interpretative approaches that scholars have taken to the Upper Palaeolithic cave art of Europe. Noting the problems innate with using the term \\"art\\", he nevertheless believes it can still be used in this context with caution. From there, he looks at the early claims that rejected symbolic-religious explanations, instead adopting an \\"art for art's sake\\" approach, and then its fall from academic credibility. He then discusses the claims that the artworks did have symbolic meanings, being either totemic or representative of sympathetic magic, both arguments made from ethnographic parallels with modern hunter-gatherer communities such as those of Australia. Lewis-Williams goes on to discuss structuralist interpretations of the artworks, such as those first advocated by Giambattista Vico and Ferdinand de Saussure, and later reformulated by the likes of Max Raphael, Annette Laming-Emperaire and Andr√© Leroi-Gourhan.Lewis-Williams 2005. pp. 41-68. Main arguments Reception and recognition Archaeologist Robert J. Wallis reviewed The Mind in the Cave for the Journal for the Academic Study of Magic. Proclaiming it to be \\"a timely introduction\\" to a shamanistic interpretation of Upper Palaeolithic rock art, Wallis believed that Lewis-Davidson puts forward \\"a compelling case\\" for the nature of such cave paintings. Although he had some reservations, he noted that the book established the shamanistic interpretation as being the \\"forefront\\" of rock art research. He ended his review by mentioning the manner in which Lewis- Williams ended the book by emphasising that there is no reason for contemporary people to be shamans; himself a Neoshaman, Wallis noted that Lewis-Williams might be concerned that \\"his work will inspire neo-Shamanism rather than rational materialism\\", but proceeded to express his opinion that even if it did so, it would \\"be none the worse for that.\\"Wallis 2004. =Wider recognition= Writing in his opening paper, \\"Agency, Intellect and the Archaeological Agenda\\", published in the academic anthology Signals of Belief in Early England: Anglo-Saxon Paganism Revisited (2010), the archaeologist Martin Carver praised Lewis-Williams' book, describing it as \\"stimulating\\" and remarking that it had \\"redefined the world of early spirituality for archaeologists\\". Considering Lewis-Williams' case to be \\"persuasive\\", Carver felt that the theories contained within it could be used to shine light on the world of Anglo-Saxon paganism.Carver 2010. p. 4.

Pecorino is a white Italian wine grape variety that grows in the Marche, Abruzzo, Tuscany, Umbria and Lazio regions of Italy. Ampelographers believe that the grape is likely native to Marche, where the soil destined for this cultivation increases every year. This grape variety is used to produce the DOCG (Denominazione di origine controllata e garantita) wines, like the Offida Pecorino DOCG, and the DOC (Denominazione di origine controllata) wines, like the Falerio dei Colli Ascolani, the Colli Maceratesi and the Falerio dei Colli Ascolani.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 774 Allen Lane 2012 Today, more than 20 qualities of wine are derived from this grape. History The Sibillini Mountains as they cut through the Fermo province in the Marche. Somewhere in this mountain chain, ampelographer believe that the wild grapevine of Pecorino originated. Pecorino is a very old variety that, as believed by ampelographers, likely originated as a wild grapevine growing in the Sibillini Mountains that was eventually domesticated for wine production. Despite its name, there is no direct link between the Pecorino grape and Pecorino cheese. Ampelographers believe that the grape's name derives from the Italian word pecora, meaning sheep, because this grape grows in the mountains where the sheep used to graze., According to local people, sheep in the Marche region would often eat the grapes while moving through the vineyards.Mary Prince \\"Local produce stars at Tomasso\\" The Metro West Daily News, October 1st, 2008Winemaking Talk \\"Pecorino\\" Accessed: March 24th, 2013 In the ancient times, Romans considered the central Italy as very important for the wine production, especially processed from this grape. This cultivation is widely documented from the second part of the 19th century. In the documental history, in the year 1526 who damaged the vineyards of the Pecorino grape in the territory of Norcia had to pay 10 coins as fine, according to the government local laws called the Statuti di Norcia (Umbria region). In 1876, the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce published an exhaustive list of variety of the grapes growing on the Italian soil; the list identified the areas of Pesaro, Ancona, Macerata and Teramo as the specific areas where mostly Pecorino grape was being grown ^ Bolletino Ampelografico, Ministero, 1876. URL consultato il 7 febbraio 2019 . Viticulture According to local legend, pecorino gets its name because sheep (pecora) are known to eat the grapes. Pecorino is an early ripening variety that tends to naturally produce low yields even without severe winter pruning. The variety does not have many viticultural hazards with a strong resistance to downy and powdery mildew. Wine regions In 2000 there were of Pecorino planted in Italy, mostly in the Arquata del Tronto region of the Ascoli Piceno province in Marche. In the 1980s, Guido Cocci Grifoni was the first producer to begin widely using Pecorino in his Offida DOC wines and introduced the variety to nearby Ripatransone. Today it is still a permitted variety in the Marche DOC wines of Falerio dei Colli Ascolani, Colli Maceratesi and Offida. In addition to be grown in Marche, plantings of Pecorino can also be found in the Chieti, Pescara and Teramo provinces of Abruzzo where it is used in the sparkling wines of Controguerra and in several Indicazione geografica tipica (IGT) wines of the region. Plantings can also be found in Liguria, Lazio, Tuscany and Umbria. =DOC regulations= The Offida DOC where Pecorino can be made as a varietal wine. In the commune of Macerata in the Marche, Pecorino can be included in the Maceratino-based white wines of the Colli Maceratesi DOC provided that it doesn't collectively exceed more than 30% of the blend along with Trebbiano, Verdicchio, Malvasia, Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Grechetto and Incrocio Bruni 54. The wine can be made in a still, sparkling spumante or as passito dessert wine. Any Pecorino destined for DOC wines must be harvested at a yield no greater than 15 tonnes/hectare with the finished wine in all styles needing to attain a minimum alcohol level of at least 11%. P. Saunders Wine Label Language pgs 146-187 Firefly Books 2004 In Controguerra, up to 30% of Pecorino in combination with Verdicchio and Chardonnay can be used in the Trebbiano-based sparkling wines of the DOC. Grapes are limited to a harvest yield of no more than 14 tonnes/hectare with the finished wine needing a minimum alcohol level of 11%. Within the Falerio dei Colli Ascolani DOC, up to 25% Pecorino can be used along with Pinot blanc, Passerina, Verdicchio and Malvasia (itself limited to no more than 7%) in the Trebbiano-based wines of the region. Grapes in this white-wine only Marche DOC are limited a maximum yield of 14 tonnes/ha with the a minimum alcohol level for the finished wine of at least 11.5%. Offida DOCG In Offida, Pecorino can be made as a varietal provided it makes up at least 85% of the blend with other local, non-aromatic grapes permitted to fill in the remainder. Here grapes are limited to a yield of 10 tonnes/ha with the finished wines have an alcohol level of at least 12%. However, unlike Passerina which is also grown in the DOCG, Pecorino is not currently permitted to be used in the DOC's Vin Santo style wine.

He was specialised in Finno-Ugric languages.  Biography  Sauvageot was born in Constantinople, as his father was an engineer working in the service of the Ottoman Sultan. In 1918, Sauvageot was admitted at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure and started studying Germanic languages. Sauvageot's teachers, most prominent among them Antoine Meillet, pushed him towards finno-ugric linguistics as the professorship for it was vacant since philologist Robert Gauthiot had been killed in the First World War. Sauvageot traveled to Uppsala in Sweden where he started learning Finnish, then moved to Finland in June 1919, and stayed there until October. In 1923, he moved to Hungary to teach French at the E√∂tv√∂s J√≥zsef Collegium in Budapest. He remained there until 1929, then moved back to France and completed his doctoral thesis on the lexicon of Uralo- Altaic languages,The Uralo-Altaic family was a hypothesis about a relationship between the Uralic and the Altaic languages. With the latter family discredited, the hypothesis is now obsolete and a complementary thesis on Gothic articles. In 1931, Sauvageot inaugurated the professorship for finno- ugric languages at the √âcole fran√ßaise des Langues Orientales. In 1932 and 1937, he published, along with J√≥zsef Balassa and Marcel Benedek the first Hungarian-French and French-Hungarian dictionary. Although Sauvageot retired in 1967, he remained actively involved in the activities of both the Soci√©t√© de Linguistique de Paris and the Cercle linguistique d'Aix en Provence, until his death in 1988.

Child was one of the first ranchers to raise purebred Hereford cattle in Montana Territory. After the very harsh Winter of 1886‚Äì87, he built a , high barn with a fieldstone foundation. It could house 500 head of cattle and up to of hay.Montana Historical Society placard at location In 1888 he also built an octagonal- shaped house on the property, with the second floor given over to an open ballroom. Child lived in Helena and used the home only for meetings and parties. He went bankrupt as a result of the Silver Panic of 1893 and died in October, 1893, after which the ranch was sold to a number of different owners over the next fifty years. The property's condition deteriorated, until Paul Kleffner obtained the ranch in 1943, first leasing it and then buying it outright in 1946. Kleffner and his family owned the ranch until 2005, when it was bought by Denis and Stacy Young. The site is now primary used as a venue to host events such as weddings.

The reason for the outbreak was claimed to be an offensive gesture towards the Hindu deity at the temple by a member of the procession. The riot was followed by a minor clash between Christians and Muslims in Udayandiram in North Arcot. There were fears of a riot in Madras city and security was tightened all over the Madras Presidency. In 1931, a second communal riot broke out in Vellore. This originated in a clash between a procession of members of the Indian National Congress and a Muslim procession in celebration of Milad-un-Nabi. The house of Muslim leader, Janab Abdul Jabbar, who is alleged to have instigated the rioters, was set on fire by a mob of over 200 Hindus but was, however, saved from destruction.

Biography Jules Brunfaut was born in Brussels on November 16, 1852. After finishing high school at the Royal Ath√©n√©e in Brussels, Brunfaut followed the courses of the School of Civil Engineering of the University of Ghent. In the midst of the exact sciences, he drew the principles of logic and reason. While following the courses of F√©lix Laureys (1820‚Äì1897) at the Academy of Fine Arts from 1873 to 1879, he completed four years of professional practice with Henri Beyaert. In 1879, after receiving a scholarship from the Belgian government to the laureates to encourage the decorative arts, Brunfaut chose the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des beaux-arts in Paris to acquire a knowledge of the conceptions of the past. Here, he met some of his friends from the Acad√©mie royale des beaux-arts de Bruxelles, Ernest Acker, George De Larabie, and Oscar Raquez, who gave him the curriculum for the classes since he was a free student. From 1879 to 1881, he studied the architect Henri Magne to Taigne, the draftsman and engraver Charles Blanc and Henri Mahieu. Brunfaut enriched his knowledge during trips to Florence, Rome, and Venice, along with the Sicilian cities of Agrigento, Selinunte, Palermo, and Monreale from 1881 to 1882. He would bring back sketchbooks that would serve as his repertoire of decorative motifs from these trips, along with details of elements of the Renaissance and Antiquity. In 1889, J. Burnay appealed to Jules Brunfaut for the restoration of the \\"Quinta do Trinidade\\" in Seixal, and for the construction of his house in Lisbon. Brunfaut then resided in Portugal, constructing the hotel of Mr. L. Ribeiro and built the art gallery of Count Daupias. Returning to Brussels, Jules Brunfaut would go on to erect bourgeois houses, mansions, castles, villas, utility buildings, industrial buildings for Solvay factories, exhibition pavilions in Belgium and abroad from 1880 to 1919. Brunfaut then closed his office in order to travel with his wife, Victorine Castaigne(1867‚Äì1930), along with his three daughters in order to devote himself to his writings and at the meetings of the commissions of which he was a member. Jules Brunfaut died in his mansion on Moli√®re Avenue, in Brussels, after a prolonged illness on January 4, 1942. He is a member of the Acad√©mie royale des sciences, des lettres et des beaux-arts de Belgique, Fine Arts Class.

Design and development Claire K. Vance founded the Vance Aircraft Corporation to build the \\"Flying Wing\\" design. The aircraft was designed though a series of hand- carved wooden models before drawings were made, with the intention of it being a high speed, high altitude air-freighter with storage in thick wing lockers. Its short air racing history was interrupted by the 1932 death of its designer Claire Vance who struck a fog-covered mountain at Rocky Ridge. The \\"Flying Wing\\" was a conventional long-range aircraft for the period with the exception of the two large booms aft of the cockpit supporting the twin tail surfaces and twin rudders, rather than a conventional fuselage. The tandem seat aircraft was converted to a single pilot aircraft that featured a radial engine and conventional landing gear (one tailwheel for each boom). Fourteen fuel tanks totaling were interconnected inside the cantilevered mid-wing. The aircraft was of mixed construction, with an aluminum-covered welded steel tube fuselage. The wing used wooden wing spars with plywood covering. A forced air induction system was built into the wing roots with exhausts mounted near the trailing edges. Operational history In 1932 the Viking dropped out of the Bendix Trophy race following fuel system issues. In 1933 it was entered, but did not compete in the Bendix Trophy race. In 1934 Lt. Murray B. Dilley purchased the aircraft and production rights from Claire Vance's estate for $10,000 with the intention of racing the aircraft in the 1934 England- Australia MacRobertson Air Race. Dilley only paid $2500 of the amount owned, and abandoned the aircraft in the desert near Palm Springs, California. During 1936 The Flying Wing was bought at auction in 1936 for $2500 by the Mason Aircraft Corporation. Clyde Pangborn planned on using the aircraft for a Dallas, Texas to Moscow Flight. Later the aircraft was returned to tandem configuration, a radio compass was installed, it was re-painted red and white and christened \\"The Texas Sky Ranger\\". Roland W. Richards sponsored the aircraft as part of a publicity campaign for the Texas Centennial Exposition to fly to New York, Paris, visit London, Amsterdam, Madrid, and Brussels and then return on a non-stop Paris to Dallas flight with Pangborn and Mony Mason as pilots. Mason backed out by not meeting a commitment, but the flight was planned to continue independently with Pangborn with newspaper sponsorship.

States interact in various ways, through economic, financial, and cultural means; security tends to not be the primary goal in state-to-state interactions; and military forces are not typically used. Liberals also argue that international diplomacy can be a very effective way to get states to interact with each other honestly and support nonviolent solutions to problems.(Shiraev and Zubok 2014,90) With the proper institutions and diplomacy, Liberals believe that states can work together to maximize prosperity and minimize conflict.Shiraev, Eric B., and Vladislav M. Zubok. 2014. International Relations. New York, NY:Oxford University Press. Liberalism is one of the main schools of international relations theory. Liberalism comes from the Latin liber meaning \\"free\\", referred originally to the philosophy of freedom.Von Mises, Ludwig, and Bettina Bien Greaves. Liberalism. [Electronic Resource]: The Classical Tradition. n.p.: Indianapolis : Liberty Fund, c2005. (Baltimore, Md. : Project MUSE, 2014), 2005. Louisiana State University. Web. 22 Feb. 2016. Its roots lie in the broader liberal thought originating in the Enlightenment. The central issues that it seeks to address are the problems of achieving lasting peace and cooperation in international relations, and the various methods that could contribute to their achievement. Supporters of liberalism often believe in the spreading of democracy through cooperation. Areas of study Broad areas of study within liberal international relations theory include: * The democratic peace theory, and, more broadly, the effect of domestic political regime types and domestic politics on international relations;The Democratic Peace Theory, Kevin Placek, Feb 18 2012Democratic Peace Theory , Dan Reiter * The commercial peace theory, arguing that free trade has pacifying effects on international relations. Current explorations of globalization and interdependence are a broader continuation of this line of inquiry; * Institutional peace theory, which attempts to demonstrate how cooperation can be sustained in anarchy, how long- term interests can be pursued over short-term interests, and how actors may realize absolute gains instead of seeking relative gains; * Related, the effect of international organizations on international politics, both in their role as forums for states to pursue their interests, and in their role as actors in their own right; * The role of international law in moderating or constraining state behavior; * The effects of liberal norms on international politics, especially relations between liberal states; * The role of various types of unions in international politics (relations), such as highly institutionalized alliances (e.g. NATO), confederations, leagues, federations, and evolving entities like the European Union; and, * The role, or potential role, of cosmopolitanism in transcending the state and affecting international relations. History =Early beginnings= Liberalism originally arose from both deep scholarly and philosophical roots. With the theory‚Äôs prime principle being international cooperation and peace, early influences are seen in some bigger religious practices sharing the same goal. It was later in the 17th and 18th centuries in which political liberalism began to take a form that challenged nobility and inherited inequality. Followed shortly after was the Enlightenment where liberal ideals began to develop with works by philosophers such as Voltaire, Locke, Smith, and German thinker Immanuel Kant. In part, liberal scholars were influenced by the Thirty Years' War and the Enlightenment. The length and disastrous effects of the Thirty Years' War caused a common disdain for warfare throughout much of Europe. Thinkers, like Locke and Kant, wrote about what they saw in the world around them. They believed that war is fundamentally unpopular and that man is born with certain rights because the end of the Thirty Years' War proved these ideas to them. John Locke discusses many ideas that are now attributed to Liberalism in Two Treatises of Government, published in 1689. In his second treatise, Locke comments on society and outlines the importance of natural rights and laws. Locke believes that people are born as blank slates without any preordained ideas or notions. This state is known as the State of Nature because it shows people in their most barbaric form. As people grow, their experiences begin to shape their thoughts and actions. They are naturally in the State of Nature until they choose not to be, until something changes their barbaric nature. Locke says that, civil government can remedy this anarchy. When it comes to the Law of Nature, people are more likely to act rationally when there is a government in place because there are laws and consequences to abide by. Locke argues that civil government can help people gain the basic human rights of health, liberty and possession. Governments that grant these rights and enforce laws benefit the world. Many of these ideas have influenced leaders such as the Founding Fathers during the American Revolution and French revolutionaries during the French Revolution. In Kant‚Äôs To Perpetual Peace, the philosopher set the way by forming guidelines to create a peace program to be applied by nations. This program would require cooperation between states as well as the mutual pursuit of secure freedom and shared benefits. One such idea was the Democratic Peace Theory. In To Perpetual Peace, Kant put forth the idea that democracies do not fight wars because leaders were too worried about re-election. Because war was naturally unpopular, Kant thought that leaders would avoid burdening voters with its costs. After seeing success in intertwining states through economic coalition, liberal supporters began to believe that warfare was not always an inevitable part of international relations. Support of liberal political theory continued to grow from there. =Neoliberalism= Kant's democratic peace theory has since been revised by neoliberals like Robert O. Keohane and Joseph S. Nye. These theorists have seen that democracies do in fact fight wars. However, democracies do not fight wars with other democracies because of capitalist ties. Democracies are economically dependent and therefore are more likely to resolve issues diplomatically. Furthermore, citizens in democracies are less likely to think of citizens in other democracies as enemies because of shared morals. Kant's original ideas have influenced liberalist scholars and have had a large impact on liberal thought.

He was one of the founding members of the Institute of British Architects in 1834. Early life Born in London on 16 May 1796, he was second son of Ambrose Lyon Poynter by Thomasine Anne Peck; the family was of Huguenot origin. Poynter was employed by John Nash from 1814 to 1818. In 1819‚Äì21, he travelled to Italy, Sicily, and the Ionian islands. He was present at John Keats's funeral in Rome on 26 February 1821. Architectural practice Poynter set up for himself as an architect in London, initially at 1 Poets' Corner, Westminster. About 1846 he built for himself a house and offices in Park Street, now Queen Anne's Gate, also in Westminster. He became noted for his Palladian and Tudor Gothic fusion architecture including the relocated Hospital and Chapel of St Katharine, Regent's Park, London in 1826‚Äì7, and St Katharine's Lodge (its later name) for its Master, Herbert Taylor. Danish Church. Poynter designed a trio of churches in Cambridge, notable bright red brick buildings: Christ Church, Newmarket Road in 1837‚Äì39; the Church of St Andrew the Great on St Andrew's Road in 1842‚Äì43, and St Paul's on Hills Road in 1841. St Paul's was the target of criticism from the Cambridge Camden Society, in the first issue (November 1841) of its journal, the Ecclesiologist. While some of the society's members found the attack embarrassing, it was supported by Augustus Pugin. The issue was withdrawn, but an offer then to review another of the Poynter churches was not conciliatory, with St Paul's being called a \\"cheap church\\"; in 1843 the Church of St Andrew was called \\"miserable and meagre\\". In 1851, Poynter was hired by Sir Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh to make additions to Pynes House near Exeter, Devon, including a ceremonial entrance hall in 1852. He also made additions to Warwick Castle and Crewe Hall. St Paul's Church, Hills Road, Cambridge Artist and illustrator Poynter lived in Paris between 1830 and 1832, where Lavinia Forster (his mother-in-law from 1832) provided a social centre for artists. They included William Callow and Richard Parkes Bonington, as well as the sculptor Henri de Triqueti who had married another daughter. Poynter sketched with, and studied watercolour painting under, Thomas Shotter Boys, who was a lifelong friend. He was an architectural draughtsman, and provided illustrations and articles in Charles Knight's Pictorial History of England (1837‚Äì44), and his edition of Shakespeare. He was a member of the Arundel Society and the Graphic Society. A student also of heraldry, he made drawings to illustrate Francis Sandford's Genealogical History of England. Ambrose Poynter, drawing of Northleach Church Later life In the mid-1840s, while serving in the capacity of the Official Referee of Metropolitan buildings, Poynter became Professor of Fine Arts at King's College London. From 1845‚Äì8, he was an inspector of the design schools but was criticised for his often contradictory reports. He served as secretary of the Institute of British Architects in 1840, 1841, and 1844, and also as its vice-president. In 1858, Poynter developed an eye affection which led to his total blindness, and some of his commissions were taken over by William Burges. He died at his home in 3 Marine Place, Dover on 20 November 1886 and was reportedly buried in Kensal Green, London. Personal life Poynter married Emma Forster (d. 1848), a granddaughter of the sculptor, Thomas Banks; their son, Sir Edward John Poynter (1836-1919), was an artist, and their grandson, Sir Ambrose Macdonald Poynter (1867-1923), a notable London-based calligrapher and architect. Their daughter Clara Bell (1834-1927) was a noted translator. Poynter married secondly in 1850.

Syfy announced the project in March 2010,Syfy Beefs Up Scripted Series Efforts and the network ordered the pilot in October.Syfy picks up 'Three Inches' pilot The pilot was delivered to the network at around the same time as the pilot for Alphas, another series with a similar premise. Syfy executives liked both pilots but felt that Alphas had better potential as an hour-long series. The network began exploring ways to reformat Three Inches, including possibly making it into a half-hour sitcom.Two Similar Pilots: Syfy‚Äôs ‚ÄòThree Inches‚Äô Faces Tweaks, Possible Half-Hour Conversion To Join ‚ÄòAlphas‚Äô As New Series Critical reception Brian Ford Sullivan of The Futon Critic gave the pilot a generally positive review. He found that the show has \\"an inherent cleverness\\" and was fun to watch. He particularly praised the performances of Reid and Marsters. However, he found the show's mixing of tones, from Walter's \\"slightly wacky home life\\" to the gloominess of his daily existence to the camaraderie with his fellow heroes to the dark possible consequences of their mission, to be uneven.The Futon's First Look: \\"Three Inches\\" (Syfy) References External links * 2011 in American television 2011 action films 2011 science fiction films 2011 science fiction action films American television pilots Syfy original films Television films as pilots Television pilots not picked up as a series ","title":"Three Inches"},{"id":"34229025","text":"Heynes may refer to: *Edward Heynes, MP for Devizes *William Heynes ","title":"Heynes"},{"id":"34229033","text":"Georg Matth√§us Vischer Georg Matth√§us Vischer (22 April 1628 - 13 December 1696) was an Austrian topographer, cartographer, engraver and parish priest in Leonstein (Upper Austria) and Vienna.

Life Born Blithfield, Staffordshire,1861 England Census he was the eldest surviving son of Welsh barrister John Williams. He was educated first at Winchester College from 1808, but moved to Westminster School in 1811. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a scholar in 1816, and graduated B.A. 1820 and M.A. 1824. On leaving Cambridge, Williams entered Lincoln's Inn as a student, and, after reading in the chambers of John Patteson and then with John Campbell, was called to the bar on 17 June 1823. He first joined the Oxford Circuit, where he soon found work; but when South Wales was detached and became an independent circuit, he travelled on that and the Chester Circuit. In October 1846, Williams was made a puisne judge of the court of common pleas, and received knighthood on 4 February 1847. Some of his major judgments were in the following cases: Earl of Shrewsbury v. Scott, 6 CB. NS. 1 (Roman Catholic disabilities); Behn v. Burness, 1 B. & S. 877 (warranties in charter parties); Johnson v. Stear, 15 CB. NS. 30 (measures of damages in trover); and Spence v. Spence, 31 L. J. C. P. 189 (application of Rule in Shelley's Case). Williams retired from the bench in 1865 owing to increasing deafness; and was created a privy councillor and a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. He died on 2 November 1875 at 24 Queen Anne's Gate, Westminster, which had been his home since 1836. He was buried at Wotton, near Dorking. A scholar and man of letters, he associated with Dean Milman, William Buckland, Richard Trench, and Henry George Liddell. A portrait of the judge in oils, by James Sant, passed into the possession of the family. Works In 1824, with John Patteson, he brought out a fifth edition of his father's notes on Saunders's Reports and established his reputation in common- law learning. In 1832 appeared the first edition of Williams's Treatise on the Law of Executors and Administrators; with seven editions during its author's lifetime, it became a standard authority. Williams also edited Richard Burn's Justice of the Peace in conjunction with Serjeant D'Oyley in 1836, and Saunders's Reports in 1845 and 1871. Family He married, in 1826, Jane Margaret, eighth daughter of the Rev. Walter Bagot, brother to William Bagot, 1st Baron Bagot, by whom he left six sons. His fifth son, Roland Vaughan Williams, became lord justice of appeal in 1897. His grandson was the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams.

Biography Born in France on May 12, 1932 Pierre made all its primary school in Lyon. Since the age of 12 he visited the caves, being the Grotte de Jujurieux his first underground emotion. In 1950, already living in Brazil, he began mapping the Santana cave in the Ribeira valley, a project he was able to complete only 14 years later. Working in Londrina, Paran√°, he founded a speleology club, outfitted it with everything necessary, trained the staff and came to attend the Ribeira valley, the Santana cave, his favorite, and neighboring caves. In July 1964 he took part in the first Brazilian speleological congress organized in the forests of Betari. Later, working for Mineradora Furnas, he began a systematic survey of caves throughout the region. In 1970 he was elected president of the SBE and, endowed with a lively intelligence, great sense of organization and a prodigious memory, he quickly outlined the structure of the society, formed binders, created registers, scientific and technical committees, etc. He also learned to establish and maintain excellent relationships with government agencies, universities and later with the International Union of Speleology. His performance was consecrated by the attainment of an award Marechal Rondon, medal given by the Brazilian Geographical Society to all those outstanding personalities in the field of science. From 1971, he definitely guides researchers for caves located in unexplored regions of Brazil. And it is with this effort that expeditions were carried out in the states of Bahia and Goias, in the Angelica - Bezerra system and several other groups Terra Ronca, S√£o Vicente, S√£o Mateus, which soon became the more extensive cavities known in the country.

He continued to work for a number of years after turning 100. Early life and education Frankland was born in Battle, Sussex, England. His father was Rev. Henry Frankland, of North Yorkshire farming stock, who at the time of his son's birth was curate of St. Mark's, Little Common, near Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, and in later years was a vicar in Cumberland. His mother, Alice (Rose), was the daughter of Henry West, a successful ironmonger of Barnsley. He was born an identical twin; his brother (the elder twin by fifteen minutes), Rev. John Ashlin Frankland, who worked in Sierra Leone in the 1950s,Crockford's Clerical Directory, vol. 90, 1987/88, Oxford University Press, 1987, p. 194 died in 1995 at age 83. They had an elder brother, Basil, who entered the fur trade in Canada, and an elder sister, Ella, who died aged 22 in 1933. Frankland reported that the family doctor was ineffective, and this motivated him to do better himself. Frankland's childhood was spent in the Lake District, and he attended the preparatory school at Rossall School, Carlisle Grammar School, then St Bees School. He subsequently studied medicine at The Queen's College, Oxford, and St. Mary's Hospital Medical School, now part of Imperial College London. Military service Frankland spent the war years 1939‚Äì45 in the Royal Army Medical Corps; initially at the Tidworth Medical Hospital, he later joined the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. In 1942, in the midst of the World War II (Pacific theatre), he was captured by the Japanese and held for three and a half years as a prisoner of war (POW) in Singapore. He would later recall: \\"Medically, as a prisoner of war, we saw conditions which are now unknown.\\" As a POW, he was forced to provide medical assistance for Japanese troops, which Frankland believed saved his life. Post-war academic career In 1946, Frankland began full-time work in the allergy department of St. Mary's Hospital, London.Frankland continued to contribute articles to academic journals beyond his official retirement and then his 100th birthday. =Hygiene hypothesis= Frankland believed that the rise in allergies results from increased cleanliness and the levels of hygiene in modern life‚Äîthe so-called hygiene hypothesis. He said: \\"We don't set off our immune system early on, we are too clean. In the former East Germany for instance, with very poor work and housing conditions, people were less allergic\\". =Pollen count= Frankland was keen to provide patients he saw in London with information about pollens, such as the levels of pollen on any given day, and the times of the year when levels would tend to be at their highest. St. Mary's Hospital employed a botanist to assist with collecting this information and to complement the work on pollen counts. =Self- experimentation= Frankland was also a supporter of the idea of desensitisation, a technique that aims to reduce the level of immune response to allergens by repeated low doses of the substance to which the patient has an allergy. In 1955, Frankland experimented on himself by being bitten each day by the blood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus. He was assisted in this work by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, which was able to supply insects that Frankland could be sure he had never previously been exposed to. The bites eventually provoked a severe anaphylactic reaction. This research contributed to an understanding of how long injections of allergens would need to be given to achieve desensitisation. Results varied by individual, but immunity to pollen was found on average after three years. Immunity to venom-based allergens took longer and was found on average after five years. =Collaboration with Alexander Fleming= During the 1950s, Frankland served as an assistant to Alexander Fleming in the development of penicillin. The two had a daily meeting, but due to Fleming's lack of interest in clinical medicine, Frankland said that he could not recall a patient ever being discussed. Frankland and Fleming were also concerned with antimicrobial resistance to penicillin, with Frankland crediting Fleming with saying that careless prescription would inadvertently lead to \\"the death of man\\". In 1954, Frankland published \\"Prophylaxis of summer Hay-fever and Asthma.\\" The article reported the results of a trial involving 200 patients with previous histories of grass pollen sensitivity half treated with active vaccines, and half with inactive 'control' vaccines. The results suggested that the active vaccines were much more effective in reducing allergy symptoms than the controls. The study was notable for being the first in the field that used randomised, controlled methods and a standardised approach to every patient. The trial, along with his work on the pollen count, was one of the contributing factors to Frankland being awarded the EAACI Noon Award for significant contributions to immunotherapy. =Saddam Hussein= In 1979 Frankland treated Iraq's then- president Saddam Hussein. Contacted to visit a VIP in Baghdad having trouble with asthma, Frankland advised Hussein this was not the case and to give up his habit of 40 cigarettes a day. Frankland said that \\"To my lasting regret, I told him that was his trouble and that if he carried on, in another two years he wouldn't be head of state. I heard sometime later that he had had a disagreement with his secretary of state for health, so he took him outside and shot him. Maybe I was lucky.\\" =Retirement= Frankland retired from his job at St. Mary's Hospital, aged 65, and was then offered an unpaid consultancy role in the Department of Medicine at Guy's Hospital. He worked at Guy's on this basis for another twenty years on peanut anaphylaxis and paediatric allergies. After retiring from Guy's he continued to participate in academic life by attending conferences and publishing articles in journals. In February 2012, Frankland appeared as an expert witness in a British court. The accused had claimed that a vehicle crash in which he was involved was caused by his losing control following a bee sting. Although Frankland agreed with the defence that such a scenario was possible, he gave an opinion that delayed-response reactions to bee stings only occurred after there had been initial symptoms following the sting. In this case, there had not been such symptoms, and the accused was found guilty. In 2015, he appeared in an episode of the BBC 2 television series Britain's Greatest Generation and as a guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. At the age of 103, he was the oldest ever guest on Desert Island Discs. In June 2015, at the age of 103, he was awarded an MBE for services to allergy research. In July 2015 he was, at age 103, the oldest recipient of the badge of the Order of Mercy.The Times, 7 November 2015 Frankland continued to publish; at age 100 he authored \\"100 years of allergen immunotherapy\\", and most recently co-authored, \\"Flight Lieutenant Peach's observations on Burning Feet Syndrome in Far Eastern Prisoners of War 1942‚Äì45\\" in the journal QJM in 2016 (aged 104). In March 2020, in an interview for his 108th birthday during the COVID-19 pandemic, he recounted some memories of the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic. Frankland died on 2 April 2020 at the age of 108 of COVID-19. Professional and charitable associations =British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology= In 1948, Frankland was instrumental in the creation of the British Association of Allergists. The speakers at the Association's inaugural meeting included Sir Henry Dale, pharmacologist and chairman of the board at the Wellcome Trust, and Dr. John Freeman. In 1962 the Association became the British Allergy Society, and Frankland served as president between 1963 and 1966. The society became the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) in 1973. =International Association of Aerobiology= Frankland was a founding member (in 1970) and president. =Anaphylaxis Campaign= Frankland was president of the Anaphylaxis Campaign, the UK charity for severe allergy issues.

Some have argued for secession as a natural right of revolution. Many independence movements exist with thousands of members, however, with moderate local support and high voter participation in the democratic elections. The Khalistan movement in Punjab was active in the 1980s and the 1990s, but is now largely subdued within India. Insurgency has occurred in North-East India, in the states of Tripura, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Manipur, Assam and Nagaland. But now, the separatism and insurgency in northeast india has now become largely insignificant due to lack of local public support. India has introduced several Armed Forces Special Powers Acts (AFSPA) to subdue insurgency in certain parts of the country.The law was first enforced in Manipur and later enforced in other insurgency-ridden north-eastern states. It was extended to most parts of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir in 1990 after the outbreak of an armed insurgency in 1989. Each Act gives soldiers immunity in specified regions against prosecution under state government unless the Indian government gives prior sanction for such prosecution. The government maintains that the AFSPA is necessary to restore order in regions like Indian territories Kashmir and Manipur. Jammu and Kashmir  Maharaja of Kashmir, Hari Singh (1895‚Äì1961) Instrument of Accession of Kashmir to India was accepted by Governor General Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma. thumb Maharaja Hari Singh became the ruler of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir in 1925, and he was the reigning monarch at the conclusion of British rule in the subcontinent in 1947. With the impending independence of India, the British announced that the British Paramountcy over the princely states would end, and the states were free to choose between the new Dominions of India and Pakistan or to remain independent. It was emphasized that independence was only a \`theoretical possibility' because, during the long rule of the British in India, the states had come to depend on British Indian government for a variety of their needs including their internal and external security. Jammu and Kashmir had a Muslim majority (77% Muslim by the previous census in 1941). Following the logic of Partition, many people in Pakistan expected that Kashmir would join Pakistan. However, the predominant political movement in the Valley of Kashmir (Jammu and Kashmir National Conference) was secular and was allied with the Indian National Congress since the 1930s. So many in India too had expectations that Kashmir would join India. : \\"Pakistan naturally expected Kashmir, with its Muslim majority, to join it. India thought that the religious factor was irrelevant, especially since the leading political party, the National Conference, was known to be non-sectarian.\\" : \\"Senior Pakistanis, many of whom had once naively simply expected that J&K; would join Pakistan, had come to believe that India had been deliberately conniving with Hari Singh to obtain J&K;'s accession. To try to prevent India's acquisition, some of these Pakistanis sent the Pukhtoons to capture J&K; for Pakistan.\\" The Maharaja was faced with indecision. On 22 October 1947, rebellious citizens from the western districts of the State and Pushtoon tribesmen from the Northwest Frontier Province of Pakistan invaded the State, backed by Pakistan. The Maharaja initially fought back but appealed for assistance to India,http://www.getmistified.com/competition_docs/2013_Topic_I_Kashmir.pdfhttp://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/4425/9/09_chapter%202.pdf who agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India.Stein, Burton. 1998. A History of India. Oxford University Press. 432 pages. . Page 368. Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession on 26 October 1947 in return for military aid and assistance, which was accepted by the Governor General the next day. While the Government of India accepted the accession, it added the proviso that it would be submitted to a \\"reference to the people\\" after the state is cleared of the invaders, since \\"only the people, not the Maharaja, could decide where Kashmiris wanted to live.\\" It was a provisional accession. Once the Instrument of Accession was signed, Indian soldiers entered Kashmir with orders to evict the raiders. The resulting Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 lasted till the end of 1948. At the beginning of 1948, India took the matter to the United Nations Security Council. The Security Council passed a resolution asking Pakistan to withdraw its forces as well as the Pakistani nationals from the territory of Jammu and Kashmir, and India to withdraw the majority of its forces leaving only a sufficient number to maintain law and order, following which a plebiscite would be held. A ceasefire was agreed on 1 January 1949, supervised by UN observers.. Excerpt at How the map of Jammu and Kashmir could have been significantly different today, Scroll.in A special United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP) was set up to negotiate the withdrawal arrangements as per the Security Council resolution. The UNCIP made three visits to the subcontinent between 1948 and 1949, trying to find a solution agreeable to both India and Pakistan. It passed a resolution in August 1948 proposing a three-part process. It was accepted by India but effectively rejected by Pakistan. In the end, no withdrawal was ever carried out, India insisting that Pakistan had to withdraw first, and Pakistan contending that there was no guarantee that India would withdraw afterward. No agreement could be reached between the two countries on the process of demilitarization. India and Pakistan fought two further wars in 1965 and 1971. Following the latter war, the countries reached the Simla Agreement, agreeing on a Line of Control between their respective regions and committing to a peaceful resolution of the dispute through bilateral negotiations. On 5 August 2019, the Government of India revoked the special status, or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir‚Äîa region administered by India as a state which consists of the larger part of Kashmir which has been the subject of dispute among India, Pakistan, and China since 1947. The state has been bifurcated into a separate union territory for Jammu and Kashmir while the other Union Territory is Ladakh. https://indianexpress.com/article/india/28-states-9-union-territories-here-is- the-new-map-of-india-6099663/ The decision to change the status of Jammu and Kashmir into two separate union territories came on August 5, 2019, when the Government of India abrogated Article 370 and 35A. https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/jammu-and-kashmir-union- territories-today-article-370-special-status-6095406/ This marks the end of the special autonomous status granted by the Constitution of India.

North East India  = Assam = The militant organization United Liberation Front of Assam demands a separate country for the indigenous people of Assam. The Government of India had banned the ULFA in 1990 and has officially labelled it as a terrorist group, whereas the US State Department lists it under \\"Other groups of concern\\".Country Reports on Terrorism, 2006 Military operations against it by the Indian Army that began in 1990 continue to the present. In the past two decades, some 10,000 people have died in the clash between the rebels and the government.Five killed in Assam bomb blasts - Dawn The Assamese secessionists have protested against the illegal migration from the neighboring regions. Since the mid-20th century, people from present-day Bangladesh (then known as East Pakistan) have been migrating to Assam. In 1961, the Government of Assam passed legislation making use of Assamese language compulsory; it had to be withdrawn later under pressure from Bengali speaking people in Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimgonj, So called Ishan Banga. In the 1980s the Brahmaputra valley saw six years of Assam agitationHazarika 2003 triggered by the discovery of a sudden rise in registered voters on electoral rolls. The Muslim United Liberation Tigers of Assam (MULTA), established in 1996, advocates a separate country for the Muslims of the region. The United People's Democratic Solidarity (UPDS) demands a sovereign nation for the Karbi people. It was formed in March 1999 with the merger of two militant outfits in Assam's Karbi Anglong district, the Karbi National Volunteers (KNV) and Karbi People‚Äôs Front (KPF).SATP - UPDS The United People's Democratic Solidarity signed a cease- fire agreement for one year with the Union Government on 23 May 2002. However, this led to a split in the UPDS with one faction deciding to continue with its subversive activities while the other commenced negotiations with the Government. = Nagalim = The Nagalim is a proposed independent country for the Naga people. In the 1950s, the Naga National Council led a violent unsuccessful insurgency against the Government of India, demanding a separate country for the Nagas. The secessionist violence decreased considerably after the formation of the Naga-majority Nagaland state, and more militants surrendered after the Shillong Accord of 1975. However, the majority of Nagas, operating under the various factions of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, continue to demand a separate country. 2014 General Elections of India recorded a voter turnout of more than 87% in Nagaland, which was the highest in India. = Tripura = The National Liberation Front of Tripura (or NLFT) is a Tripuri nationalist organisation which seeks for Tripura to secede from India and establish an independent Tripuri state. It has actively participated in the Tripura Rebellion. The NLFT manifesto says that they want to expand what they describe as the Kingdom of God and Christ in Tripura. The Tripura National Volunteers (also known as the Tribal National Volunteers or Tripura National Volunteer Force) was founded in 1978 with assistance from the Mizo National Front. The group has significantly reduced terror activities and recently 88 cadres of NLFT surrendered to the Indian Government. Punjab  = Khalistan = The Khalistan movement aimed to create a separate independent country for Sikhs . The territorial definition of the proposed country Khalistan consists of Punjab, India and includes parts of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, and Rajasthan.The foreign policy of Pakistan: ethnic impacts on diplomacy, 1971-1994 - Mehtab Ali Shah \\"Such is the political, psychological and religious attachment of the Sikhs to that city that a Khalistan without Lahore would be like a Germany without Berlin.\\"Amritsar to Lahore: A Journey Across the India-Pakistan Border - Stephen Alter \\"Ever since the separatist movement gathered force in the 1980s, Pakistan has sided with the Sikhs, the territorial ambitions of Khalistan have at times included Chandigarh, sections of the Indian Punjab, including whole North India and some parts of western states of India.\\" After the partition of India, the majority of the Sikhs migrated from the Pakistani part to the Indian province of Punjab, which then included the parts of the present-day Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. Following India's independence in 1947, the Punjabi Suba movement led by the Sikh political party Akali Dal led to the trifurcation of the Punjab state. The remnant Punjab state became Sikh- majority and Punjabi-majority. Subsequently, a section of the Sikh leaders started demanding more autonomy for the states, alleging that the central government was discriminating against Punjab. Although the Akali Dal explicitly opposed the demand for an independent Sikh country, the issues raised by it were used as a premise for the creation of a separate country by the proponents of Khalistan. In June 1984, the Indian Government ordered a military operation, Operation Blue Star to clear Harmandir Sahib, Amritsar and thirty other Gurdwaras (Sikh places of worship) of armed Sikhs who were with many other pilgrims in Gurdwaras. The Indian Army used 3,000 armed troops of the 9th Division of the National Security Guards, the 175 Parachute Regiment and artillery units, and 700 CRPF Jawans. During this operation, the Indian army had around 700 casualties with 220 injuries, and 200‚Äì250 Sikh militants were killed. The handling of the operation, damage to the holy shrine and loss of life on both sides, led to widespread criticism of the Indian Government. The Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her two Sikh bodyguards in retaliation. Following her death, thousands of Sikhs were killed in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. The subsequent Punjab insurgency saw several secessionist militant groups becoming active in Punjab, supported by a section of the Sikh diaspora. Indian security forces suppressed the insurgency in the early 1990s.

College Street in the city of Tyler, Smith County, Texas, U.S. It was built in 1904 as the Carnegie Public Library, and added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Smith County, Texas in 1979. When Tyler built a new public library, the Carnegie building was leased to the Smith County Historical Society and continues to operate as a museum and archives. Carnegie library In 1903, Tyler was the recipient of an $15,000 grant from the Andrew Carnegie Library Fund. The grant was part of $645,000 the Fund distributed to thirty-four areas in Texas for the establishments of individual libraries between 1898 and 1917. Philanthropist Andrew Carnegie (1835 ‚Äì1919) encouraged the establishment of libraries in geographical areas by requiring annual matching local funds equal to at least ten percent of the grant itself. Andrew Carnegie's agreement with Tyler was that it would raise $1,500 annually to maintain and operate the library. The initial matching fund in Tyler was for essentials such as purchase of the land and interior furnishings. Tyler's populace rose to the occasion in support of its proposed library. Portraits of Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis were donated by the Mollie Moore Davis Chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy. Contributions to buy a $2,000 lot from Annie Regina McMahon on which to locate the library came from 172 local citizens. Limestone and brick was used in 1904 for the construction of the library, which was topped with a red tile roof. The area media gave due attention to the fund raising, and generosity of the citizens resulted in everything from botanical gifts for landscaping, to wall hangings, books and publications to fill its shelves, construction materials and services, and a piano for its auditorium. The building was doubled in size in 1936 by a $25,000 expansion project that upgraded the interior lighting. In 1965, a children's literature department was sectioned off from the upstairs auditorium. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Smith County, Texas in 1979. Carnegie History Center Upon the 1980 construction of the new Tyler Public Library across the street at 201 S. College, the city of Tyler leased the Carnegie Library to the Smith County Historical Society, at which time the structure was renovated. In 1984, the Carnegie History Center opened in the building, operated by the historical society. In 1959, the historical society was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. The history center houses all manner of historical artifacts, archives and resource materials. Donations supplement financial support from the society. Research assistance is provided at a fee. The Carnegie History Center dissolved into the Smith County Historical Society in the 1990s, and the Society maintains all museum exhibits and artifacts. =Hours, admission, parking= The museum is open to the public five days a week, closed on Sunday and Monday.

It was written by the American anthropologist and folklorist Sabina Magliocco of California State University, Northridge and first published in 2004 by the University of Pennsylvania Press. It was released as a part of a series of academic books titled 'Contemporary Ethnography', edited by the anthropologists Kirin Narayan of the University of Wisconsin and Paul Stoller of West Chester University. Magliocco became interested in studying the American Pagan movement in the mid-1990s, following the culmination of her fieldwork research in a Sicilian village. From 1995 through to 1997, she began studying the Pagan community in the San Francisco Bay Area, joining a Wiccan group, the Coven Trismegiston, which was led by the high priest Don Frew and high priestess Anna Korn. Becoming involved with the faith, Magliocco noted that she no longer remained an objective outsider, but became an active participant after experiencing altered states of consciousness during several Pagan rituals. In 2002 she published her first book on the subject, Neo-pagan Sacred Art and Altars: Making Things Work, which was followed by the more general Witching Culture two years later. Witching Culture provides an anthropological study of the Wiccan and wider Pagan community in the U.S., with a particular emphasis on the role that folklore has within the movement; in this it looks both at how Pagans have adopted pre-existing folklore and how unique Pagan folklore actually develops within the community. It deals with the influence of folkloristic on the early development of Wicca, in particular the influence of figures like Sir James Frazer, Charles Leland and Margaret Murray. The reviews published in specialist academic journals were predominantly positive, with James R. Lewis and Jacqueline Simpson being particularly praiseworthy, although some reviewers opined that Magliocco's openly Pagan beliefs had some negative repercussions for the study. Background =Paganism and Wicca in the United States= Contemporary Paganism, or Neo-Paganism, is a wide variety of modern religious movements influenced by the various pagan beliefs of pre-modern Europe.Carpenter 1996. p. 40.Lewis 2004. p. 13. The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or Wicca, was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and is one of several Pagan religions. The figure at the forefront of Wicca's early development was the English occultist Gerald Gardner (1884-1964), the author of Witchcraft Today (1954) and The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as Gardnerian Wicca. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a Horned God and a Mother Goddess, the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a Wheel of the Year and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as covens. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, Raymond Buckland (1934-), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven in Long Island.Hutton 1999 pp. 205-252.Clifton 2006. pp. 24-25. In the U.S., new variants of Wicca developed, including Dianic Wicca, a tradition founded in the 1970s that was influenced by second wave feminism, emphasized female-only covens, and rejected the veneration of the Horned God. One initiate of both the Dianic and Gardnerian traditions was a woman known as Starhawk (1951-) who went on to found her own tradition, Reclaiming Wicca, as well as publishing The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess (1979), a book that helped spread Wicca throughout the U.S.Hutton 1999. pp. 340-351.Clifton 2006. pp. 122-123. =Academic fieldwork into Paganism= Prior to Magliocco's work, multiple American researchers working in the field of Pagan studies had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practicing Wiccan, journalist and political activist Margot Adler in her Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess- Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today, first published by Viking Press in 1979.Adler 1979. A second study was produced by the anthropologist Tanya M. Luhrmann in her Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London.Luhrmann 1989. This was followed by the sociologist Loretta Orion's Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited (1995), which focused on Pagan communities on the American East Coast and Midwest.Orion 1995. 1997 then saw the publication of Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia, authored by the anthropologist Lynne Hume.Hume 1997. Next came the work of the American sociologist Helen A. Berger with her A Community of Witches: Contemporary Neo- Paganism and Witchcraft in the United States (1999).Berger 1999. Then there was Jone Salomonsen's study of the Reclaiming tradition in San Francisco, Enchanted Feminism: The Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco (2002).Salomonsen 2002. =Magliocco and her research= Magliocco became interested in Paganism in the mid-1990s, intending to explore \\"the confluence of ritual, festival, gender and politics - the subject of my earlier research in Italy - in a new context\\". Initially she was interested in Paganism as a \\"folk revival, in issues surrounding the use of folklore from academic sources, cultural appropriation, and the construction of authenticity in the invention of rituals\\" rather than in any actual spiritual capacity.Magliocco 2004. p. 10. In February 1995, Magliocco attended the first Pantheacon conference, a meeting of practicing Pagans and academics held at a hotel in San Jose, California. It was at the conference that she took part in a ritual led by members of the Reclaiming Wiccan tradition, later characterizing it as \\"my first powerfully affecting ritual experience in a Neo-Pagan context\\".Magliocco 2004. p. 1. Magliocco had initially intended to conduct a long-term period of fieldwork among a single Pagan group, with a focus on understanding their \\"dynamics of ritual creation\\", but ultimately was unable to do this; from 1994 through to 1997, she held a series of temporary academic appointments at universities across the United States, preventing her from staying in one area for any lengthy period of time and studying any one particular group there. However, from 1995 through to 1997, she was living in Berkeley, California, where she immersed herself in the one of \\"the country's oldest and most active Neo-Pagan communities\\", that of the San Francisco Bay Area. Here, she befriended Holly Tannen, a folklorist and ballad performer who was well known and respected among the Pagan community of northern California. It was through Trennan that she was introduced to many other members of the Pagan community, including to a local Gardnerian Wiccan coven. In 1996, she moved into a \\"small rental house\\" in the Berkeley Flats along a line of houses that were nicknamed \\"Witch Row\\" (a fact that she was unaware of at the time), and it was here that she befriended further members of the Pagan community; her neighbors were elders in the Fellowship of the Spiral Path, while another neighboring house was the home of Judy Foster, a founding member of the New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn. Several streets away lived Don Frew and Anna Korn, the high priest and high priestess of a Gardnerian group known as the Coven Trismegiston.Magliocco 2004. p. 11. Deciding that she wanted to actively participate in the religions she was studying, Magliocco was initiated into the Coven Trismegiston, and went on to begin training in the Reclaiming tradition.Magliocco 2004. pp. 11-12. In 2002 she published her first academic study of American Paganism, Neo-pagan Sacred Art and Altars: Making Things Work. Witching Culture was published in the \\"Contemporary Ethnography\\" series of books, edited by the anthropologists Kirin Narayan of the University of Wisconsin and Paul Stoller of West Chester University.University of Pennsylvania Press. undated. Magliocco dedicated the book to the memory of Andrew V√°zsonyi (1906-1986),Magliocco 2004. unnumbered opening page. a Hungarian folklorist and novelist who had worked for two decades at the Indiana University Bloomington in the United States.D√∂m√∂t√∂r 1986. Synopsis In her introduction, \\"The Ethnography of Magic and the Magic of Ethnography\\", Magliocco discusses how she first became involved with the Pagan movement, and includes extracts from the field notes that she made at the time. Going on to lay out the objectives of the book, Magliocco discusses the history of Wicca, and the influence that early anthropologists like Edward Taylor and James Frazer had on it as a burgeoning movement. Proceeding to discuss the pre- existing academic studies of the Pagan movement, she explains her own approach to the subject and how it differs from those of her predecessors, in particular focusing on her own spiritual experiences and altered states of consciousness that she experienced while taking part in Pagan ritual and her insider-outsider perspective on the Pagan movement.Magliocco 2004. pp. 1-19. =Part I: Roots and Branches= Chapter one, \\"The Study of Folklore and the Reclamation of Paganism\\", offers a historical introduction to Contemporary Paganism, looking at its roots in the Classical World of Greece and Rome, and then the successive influences of Neoplatonism, Renaissance magic, the Protestant Reformation and the Enlightenment. Magliocco then looks at the influence that 18th and 19th century folkloristics and anthropology had on the Romanticists and then Pagan movement, in particular the work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the Brothers Grimm and Sir James Frazer. Proceeding to look at this relationship, she highlights the work of Charles Leland, Margaret Murray and Gerald Gardner, who drew from folklore in their own books, all of which heavily influenced modern Paganism. Magliocco argues that Contemporary Paganism can be viewed as a \\"folk tradition\\" on two levels; firstly, because it continues to work with and propagate the spiritual traditions of western esotericism, and secondly, because it acts as a form of \\"resistance culture\\" in opposition to dominant trends in western culture. Finally, she borrows the concept of \\"textual poachers\\" from the French sociologist Michel de Certeau, arguing that the Pagan community fit this model well, collating elements from a wide variety of sources and composing them into something new, in this case a religious movement.Magliocco 2004. pp. 23-56. Chapter two, \\"Boundaries and Borders: Imagining Community\\", opens with a discussion of how Pagans distinguish themselves from one another and from the wider society around them, before delving into the idea that folklore is vital to Pagan \\"group formation\\". Magliocco goes on to describe the Pagan community, with a particular emphasis on those in the United States, dealing with such subjects as ethnicity, education, gender and sexual orientation. Moving on to look at how Pagans forge their own identities, she highlights factors such as costume and use of language, and whether such Pagan coding is explicit, complicit or implicit. Magliocco discusses the various different Pagan traditions, and the community division between those who call themselves \\"witches\\" and those who do not. She then rounds off the chapter with a discussion of the anthropological fieldwork that she undertook among the San Francisco Bay Area Pagan community between 1995 and 2000, the Coven Trismegiston that she worked with, and the local Gardnerian, Reclaiming and NROOGD traditions that she encountered there.Magliocco 2004. pp. 57-92. =Part II: Religions of Experience= The third chapter, \\"Making Magic: Training the Imagination\\", begins with Magliocco's assertion that the unifying feature of the Pagan movement is the ritual experiences that its practitioners undertake. Devoting the rest of the chapter to an examination of how Pagans \\"conceive of and practice magic\\", she argues that they do not do so in order to escape rationality, but rather they adopt a belief in magic in order to reclaim \\"traditional ways of knowing that privilege the imagination\\". Noting that within Paganism, artists are viewed as magicians, she suggests that magic should itself viewed as an art, with both having the goal of bringing about emotional reactions and changes of consciousness. Exploring the various different definitions of \\"magic\\" developed within anthropology, Magliocco notes that most contemporary North Americans equate \\"magic\\" with superstition and irrational behavior. She then looks at Pagan understandings of magic, highlighting that Pagans typically try to rationalize magic, viewing it as an energy force in an interconnected universe, one that must obey natural laws, rather than as some un-explainable \\"supernatural\\" force. Moving on, Magliocco discusses the Pagan concept of a sacred universe, looking at the veneration of the natural world and the celebration of seasonal Sabbats, and the relevance that that has for Pagan magical beliefs. Exploring Pagan ethics surrounding the practice of magic, in particular the Wiccan Rede and the Law of Threefold Return, Magliocco also studies the manner in which Pagans have re-adopted vernacular magic as a part of their religious practices.Magliocco 2004. pp. 95-121. =Part III: Beyond Experience: Religion and Identity= Arguments =Insider/outsider dichotomy= In undertaking her fieldwork, Magliocco discussed whether she took an \\"outsider\\" perspective, thereby being objective about those whom she was researching, or whether she had adopted an \\"insider\\" perspective, thereby being subjective in her views of Pagans and Paganism. She claimed that the question as to whether she was an insider or outsider researcher was akin to a question that she had been posed as a child; being an Italian American, Magliocco had often been asked whether she was Italian or American, to which she would respond that she was both. As she noted: :My answer to readers who want to know whether I am \\"really\\" an insider or an outsider to the Pagan community is that I am neither and both - that how I look at things depends very much upon context, but contains both anthropological and Pagan perspectives at the same time. The ethnographic perspective is not about being an objective observer of a culture, but rather about containing within one body multiple, simultaneous frames of reference with which to interpret experience, and being able to shift easily from one to the other. In this position, Magliocco was in agreement with Jone Salomonsen, the feminist theologian and ethnographer who had performed fieldwork among the Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco in order to gain research for her book Enchanted Feminism (2002).Magliocco 2004. p. 16. Salomonsen had called this mixed insider/outsider approach the \\"method of compassion\\" and wrote that it \\"does not refer to a wholesale positive embracement, nor to passionate criticisms and arguing, but to something in between... Engagement is more than participation, and something other than pretending. To allow oneself to become engaged is to take the ritual seriously. It is [being] willing to let the trance induction take you into trance, to be willing to be emotionally moved as is intended by certain ritual elements, and [to] go with what happens.\\"Salomonsen 2002. pp. 4, 9, 11. =Altered states of consciousness= Magliocco also saw herself as an insider because she allowed herself to experience the altered states of consciousness that contemporary Pagan rituals are reported to induce. As she stated, \\"I take an experiential approach to the extraordinary experiences\\" that occur in ritual, and that the \\"essence of this approach is twofold\\". The first part of this involved the \\"conscious, willing, and full participation in ritual experiences intended to induce alternate states of consciousness, and the interpretation of visions and dreams\\" as different ways of interpreting life. The second part of this \\"mandates that I consider informants' experiences seriously\\" when they discuss altered states of consciousness.Magliocco 2004. p. 14. Magliocco highlighted the work of the anthropologists David Young and Jean-Guy Goulet in their Being Changed: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experience (1994), who had argued that spiritual experiences were relatively common among anthropologists, but that most of those working in the discipline fail to speak publicly about their experiences because of a fear of \\"ridicule and ostracism\\" by their peers.Magliocco 2004. p. 13.Young and Goulet 1994. pp. 7-8. She went on to highlight the work of other anthropologists who have discussed their own spiritual experiences that occurred while taking part in rituals in the midst of their fieldwork,Magliocco 2004. pp. 13-14. such as Bruce Grindal's experience among the Sisala in Ghana,Grindal 1983. p. 68. Raymond Lee's experience with Malay spirit possession rites,Lee 1987. p. 74. and Edith Turner's experience in a Ndembu healing ritual.Turner 1994. p. 83. Reception and recognition =Academic reviews= Reviewing Witching Culture in The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies, the American religious studies scholar James R. Lewis described the work as \\"the best survey to date\\" of modern Paganism, \\"particularly if the focus of one's interest is North American Paganism\\". In his opinion, Witching Culture \\"breaks important new ground in Pagan Studies. In fact, I anticipate that in the near future it will come to be regarded as a groundbreaking book‚Äîone to which all future studies of Paganism will refer.\\" He went on to describe it as \\"my first choice for a textbook in any university class with a significant component on contemporary Paganism\\" and felt that \\"Almost every chapter contains either new insights or original analyses that extend prior discussions to a new depth.\\" Lewis noted that although he didn't have \\"any real criticism\\" of the book, he wished that it had discussed the role of solitary practitioners and teenage Wiccans, two significant sectors of the Pagan community whom Magliocco only mentioned in passing, and the infighting among the Wiccan community, which Magliocco hadn't even mentioned. Ultimately, Lewis remarked that \\"I can heartily recommend this book as a 'must read' for anyone in this field, whether academic observers or reflective participants.\\" In her review for the Folklore journal, the English folklorist Jacqueline Simpson described Witching Culture as offering a \\"fascinating analysis\\" of how U.S. Pagans have \\"adopted and adapted elements of European folk practice to fit the Gardnerian framework of their rituals and spells\\". Ultimately, she characterised the work as being \\"a very informative and well-researched study, and a most interesting read\\".Simpson 2005. Roman I. Shiyan of the University of Alberta reviewed Witching Culture in the journal Ethnologies, stating that the work was \\"lucid evidence of the growing popularity of neo-pagan topics in North America and the academic world in particular\\" and that Magliocco \\"raises several important theoretical issues\\" regarding the topic. In conclusion, he felt that the book \\"takes us deep into a largely obscure and often misunderstood culture, which offers a very different perspective of the world and the place of humans in it\\".Shiyan 2005. In the Journal of American Folklore, the sociologist Gary Alan Fine published a review of Magliocco's work in which he described it as \\"a richly textured ethnography, as fine a participant-observation account of an American scene as folklore has been gifted with since Leslie Prosterman's Ordinary Life, Festival Days\\". Believing that Magliocco's analysis had revealed Paganism to be the most \\"politically progressive and postmodern\\" religion in existence \\"despite [its] considerable borrowings of traditional themes\\", Fine felt that Witching Culture was \\"an effective and affectionate guide in mapping the development of Neo-Paganism in America and the multiple - and occasionally conflicting - strains from which it draws\\". He did however note that in his opinion the author had failed to \\"stand sufficiently back from the movement to gain the analytic purchase that comes from skepticism. Granted, all religions appear gawky in their adolescence, but sometimes disciplinary agnosticism permits us to discount desired but undeserved self-presentations. While no researcher should scorn the belief system of a group that she encounters, neither is it necessary to nuzzle. This attachment may cause Magliocco to downplay sexuality, drug use, and posturing in the community. These seekers often appear in her telling to be, frankly, rather puritanical.\\" He went on to remark that a \\"more distanced view would emphasize the struggles over political correctness that challenge the movement as it staggers toward a consensual theology\\", in particular its controversial cultural borrowings from Native American cultures. Ultimately however, he felt that as an \\"account of the folkloric practices of a burgeoning social scene\\", Witching Culture warrants \\"high praise\\".Fine 2005. In her review, published in the History of Religions journal, Stefanie von Schnurbein of the Nordeuropa-Institut, Humboldt-Universit√§t, Berlin, wrote that Magliocco dealt with \\"a sadly understudied issue\\" in her study, but that \\"To the disappointment of a reader who expects a theoretically advanced discussion of these relations [between religious culture and academic thinking], the historical argument and material do not go far beyond Ronald Hutton's in-depth study of the history of modern pagan witchcraft, The Triumph of the Moon.\\" Continuing with her review, Von Schnurbein opines that Magliocco manages to create a \\"vivid impression of, and informed insights into, the different facets and contradictions of a contemporary religious movement\\", one that \\"allows for well-informed critiques of the problem of rooting spirituality in ethnic or cultural heritage and of the problem of cultural exploitation through borrowing\\". Nonetheless, she notes that because Magliocco herself is a practicing Pagan, it \\"limits to a certain degree the author's ability to scrutinize further some of the problems intrinsic to the reception and resignification of ideologically questionable concepts and theories\\". She also notes that in Magliocco's work, \\"art, creativity, and imagination are depicted as exclusively positive forces that are rooted in experience and are responsible for the potential of resistance to be found in neopagan ritual and religion\\". In Von Schnurbein's opinion, \\"The next step of critical investigation would be to analyze this concept of art as a construction as well.\\"Von Schnurbein 2008. =Response from the Pagan community= Writing on The Cauldron website, a practicing Pagan using the pseudonym of \\"Pitch\\" described the work as \\"thoughtful, insightful, fruitful, grounded, and, maybe, provocative\\" as well as being a \\"Must Have, Double Bag!\\" book that \\"all of us should be proud to add to our libraries\\".Pitch. undated.

The high-point of Gaelic dictionary production was in the first half of the 19th century, as yet unrivalled even by modern developments in the late 20th and early 21st century. The majority of dictionaries published to date have been Gaelic to English dictionaries. Vocabularies The first precursors of true Gaelic dictionaries were the vocabularies, often little less than wordlists, which made their first appearance in 1702 with Rev. Robert Kirk's wordlist, an appendix to William Nicolson's Scottish Historical Library.Thomson, D. The Companion to Gaelic Scotland (1994) Gairm Edward Lhuyd's Scottish field work between 1699-1700 contained substantial wordlists for Argyll and Inverness-shire dialects which, however, were not published until much later. Some 40 years later, the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge published a title called Leabhar a Theagasc Ainminnin (\\"A book for the teaching of names\\") in 1741, compiled by Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair.

Exactly 10 years later Peter MacFarlane, a translator of religious publications published the first bidirectional dictionary in 1815, the New English and Gaelic Vocabulary - Focalair Gaelig agus Beurla. Although the Highland Society of Scotland had set up a committee in 1806 to produce a full- scale dictionary, but was beaten by Robert Armstrong who published his Gaelic Dictionary in 1825, followed three years later by the Highland Society's dictionary in 1828 entitled Dictionarium Scoto-Celticum - A Dictionary of the Gaelic Language I & II.Dictionarium Scoto-Celticum - A Dictionary of the Gaelic Language Highland Society of Scotland 1828 Various other dictionaries followed, most notably Alexander Macbain's Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language in 1896, to date the only such publication in Gaelic.

Faclair na G√†idhlig A partnership of the universities of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Strathclyde and Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig UHI is working to develop an authoritative, historical Gaelic dictionary comparable to the resources available for Scots and English through the Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue, the Scottish National Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary. The dictionary will document fully the history of the Gaelic language and culture from the earliest manuscript material onwards, placing Gaelic in context with Irish and Scots. By allowing identification of the Gaelic/Scots interface throughout Scottish history, it will increase our understanding of our linguistic national heritage and will reveal the fundamental role of Gaelic in the linguistic identity of Scotland. Of equal importance, it will show the relationship between Scottish Gaelic and Irish. The project draws on the Corpas na G√†idhlig, part of the Digital Archive of Scottish Gaelic based at the University of Glasgow. Specialist dictionaries Except for place-name publications, specialist dictionaries remain rare and focus almost exclusively on the natural world or government terminology.

His command comprised more than 34,000 Air Force operational and support personnel stationed at eight major bases and more than 87 facilities principally located in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Hawaii.  Early life and education  Braswell was born in 1925 to Claiborne and Marguerite Braswell in Minden, Louisiana, and graduated in 1942 from Minden High School. He attended Louisiana State University for two years and in 1944 entered the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. He was appointed Cadet Brigade Commander, the \\"First Captain\\", of the corps of cadets in his final year and graduated in 1948 with honors and earned a commission as a second lieutenant in the newly established U.S. Air Force. After graduation Braswell married his high school sweetheart, Ione Davis. She gave birth to their son Jefferson in 1949 and daughter Sally in 1955.  Career  After completing flying training at Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, and at Williams Air Force Base in Arizona, he became in September 1949, a member of the 33rd Fighter Wing at Otis Air Force Base in Massachusetts, where he flew F-86 Sabrejets. In 1951-1952, Braswell flew 155 combat missions in jet fighters as a member of the 49th Fighter Wing, Taegu Air Base, South Korea, and the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing at Kimpo Air Base, South Korea. From September 1952 to September 1955, he was a flight commander and squadron operations officer in the 3600th Combat Crew Training Group at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. When the U.S. Air Force Academy opened in 1955 in temporary facilities at Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, Braswell was assigned as commander of one of the original four cadet squadrons and served in that capacity for three years. In October 1958, he was again assigned to the 49th Fighter Wing, which had been relocated to Etain Air Base in France, where for a time he was deployed to supervise combat training of French, Danish and Turkish pilots in F-100 Super Sabre aircraft and then commanded the 7th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany. Braswell returned to the United States in August 1961 to attend the Air Command and Staff College. He transferred to Washington, D.C., in July 1962 and was assigned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force in the Directorate of Plans, where he prepared recommendations to the Air Force Chief of Staff on joint planning issues. In August 1966, Braswell entered the National War College at Fort Lesley J. McNair in Washington, D.C.. He graduated from the college and also completed his Master of Business Administration degree from George Washington University in 1967. He began a one-year tour of duty in the Vietnam War in July 1967 as director of plans at headquarters of the 7th Air Force, in Saigon. Though a staff officer and not required to fly, he voluntarily flew 40 combat missions, most of them in F-4 Phantoms. Following his return from Southeast Asia in August 1968, Braswell became the director of operations for the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina. He was again assigned to Air Force headquarters in August 1969 in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Plans and Operations, where he served initially as an Air Staff planning representative in Joint Staff planning conferences. In 1970 he was promoted to the grade of Brigadier General and assigned as deputy director for force development in the Directorate of Plans, and in February 1972, he became deputy director of plans. In February 1973, Braswell was promoted to the grade of major general and assumed command of United States Air Forces units based in Turkey, with headquarters in Ankara]. Braswell was assigned to Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, Belgium, as assistant chief of staff for operations from September 1974 to June 1977. In July 1977 he was promoted to Lt. General and returned to the United States as Director for Plans and Policy (J-5), Organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon. In June 1978, he became commander of Tactical Air Command's 9th Air Force with headquarters at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina. In that position he also served as commander of the Air Force units assigned to the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force of the U.S. Readiness Command. In June, 1981 he was appointed Commander- in-Chief of Pacific Air Forces, an Air Force major command, headquartered in Hawaii, which encompassed all of the tactical air combat units in the Pacific Theater. The general in his Air Force career logged more than 5,500 flying hours, most of these in jet fighters. He was promoted to lieutenant general July 1, 1977, with date of rank listed as June 28, 1977. He retired on October 1, 1983. After retiring from the U.S. Air Force, Braswell served for ten years in Arlington, Virginia, as the President of the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute (ARI), the national trade association of companies involved in the manufacture of air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment. In this capacity he helped guide ground-breaking negotiations with major environmental groups to write and propose to Congress legislation establishing national mandatory efficiency standards for energy-consuming appliances. Both houses of the Congress passed the proposed legislation as written by unanimous vote, and it was signed into law by President Reagan. Under his guidance ARI also coordinated extensive research by industry companies to develop and employ new refrigerants that would not damage the protective ozone layer in the upper atmosphere.  Awards and recognitions  His military decorations and awards include the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, Distinguished Flying Cross, and Air Medal with four oak leaf clusters.  Personal life  After retirement, Braswell served for six years as a member of the Volunteer Advisory Board for the public school technical training courses in Fairfax County, Virginia, and also for six years as the President of the Chesterbrook Woods Citizen's Association in McLean, Virginia. In 2009, he and Ione moved to Falcons Landing, a lifetime continuing care retirement facility in Potomac Falls, Virginia.

The SIMILE tools assist in the storage, querying, transformation and mapping of very large collections of RDF data. The tools developed within SIMILE are meant to allow people who are not Semantic Web developers to create ontologies which describe their specialized metadata, create RDF and convert other types of metadata into RDF. These open source tools are designed to be scalable and provide for cross-community sharing of metadata at low cost. Longwell Longwell is a faceted browser which enables the user to visualize and browse any RDF data set, allowing the user to quickly build a user-friendly web site out of the RDF data without requiring the user to write any RDF code. Facets are metadata fields considered important for a given data set. In its default configuration, the collection of facets is returned along the right-hand side of the page, and clicking on any facet causes the refinement of facets in relation to the data retrieved. Longwell then displays only the subset of the data which meet those restrictions. This appears on the left-hand side of the page. Previously selected restrictions can be removed, which causes a broadening of the subset of items displayed. Piggy Bank Piggy Bank is a Firefox extension which enables the user to collect information from the Web, save it for future use, tag it with keywords, search and browse information collected, retrieve saved information, share collected information and install screen scrapers. Piggy Bank gathers RDF data where it is available, and where it is not available, it generates it from HTML by using screen scrapers. This incremental approach to the realization of the Semantic Web vision allows the user to save and tag information gathered from web pages without having to cut, paste and label the various products of their browsing. By clicking on the keyword they have used to tag particular types of item, the user can view all of those items together within her browser, without having to open other applications. Users can also deposit saved data in the Semantic Bank, where other users can browse it and add their own contributions. This pooling of keywords underlies services such as Flickr and del.icio.us, where communities can collaborate to build a taxonomy for shared data. These taxonomies, which emerge as information is accumulated, are known as folksonomies. Solvent Solvent is a Firefox extension that enables the user to write screen scrapers for Piggy Bank. Gadget Gadget is an XML inspector which enables the user to condense large amounts of well-formed XML data. Welkin Welkin is a graph-based RDF visualizer. It graphs RDF data sets, allowing the user to visualize the global shape and clustering characteristics of the data, which can aid them in mentally modeling it, seeing how it connects and identifying mappings between the set and possible ontologies. A particular data cluster which stands out when graphed might well be missed when browsed at closer range. Fresnel Fresnel is a vocabulary for specifying how RDF graphs are presented. Fresnel addresses the problem that currently, each RDF browser and visualization tool decides, on an ad hoc basis, what information in an RDF graph is presented and how to present it. Fresnel uses the concepts of lenses and formats. Lenses determine which properties are displayed and how they are ordered. Formats control how resources and properties are presented. Timeline Timeline is a tool for visualizing events over time. It can be populated by pointing it at an XML file Exhibit Exhibit is technology that enables developers to provide browsing of faceted classifications in a web browser. Referee Referee is a program that crawls the links that point to its user's pages. It extracts metadata from those pages and the text around the links that pointed to its user's pages, converting it, if need be, into RDF format. Referee discriminates between the pages that refer to the user's pages and the comments, meaning the text immediately surrounding the link. It generates a data graph, allowing it to display the fact that, for example, exactly the same comment in relation to its user's pages appears on more than one page, which is the container of the comment. A page can have more than one comment, and a comment can appear on more than one page. This can be illustrated in a data graph, but would not be possible with a data tree, such as is generated by the XML data model. RDFizer The RDFizer project is a directory of tools for converting various data formats into RDF. MIT Libraries provides a home for some of these tools. RDFizers are a group of tools that allows the transformation of existing data into an RDF representation. Given a database of interest, these tools can often - when the data formats are highly structured -convert the data into an RDF representation without human intervention, first determining what ontology to use to express the information. Where semantic relationships are implicit, the RDFizers will not be as successful without human input. The SIMILE project has built RDFizers that convert from the following formats: * JPEG Joint Photographic Experts Group (Digital Photo-METADATA). * MARC United States Library of Congress MAchine-Readable Cataloging of bibliographic data. * MODS Metadata Object Description Schema for bibliographic element sets. * OAI-PMH Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting. * OCW Open Course Ware * EMail * BibTeX a tool for formatting lists of references usually associated with LaTex documents. * Flat * Weather * Java is an object-oriented applications programming language * Javadoc tool for generating API documentation into HTML format from Java source code. * Subversion or SVN is a software revision control system. * Random  Crowbar  Crowbar is a web scraping environment based on the use of a server-side headless Mozilla-based browser. It is used as a research prototype to investigate how to enable the running of Piggy Bank JavaScript scrapers from the command line and thus automate web site scraping. Computing-related lists Ontology (information science) ","title":"List of SIMILE projects"},{"id":"34229835","text":"Mark Kidel (born 6 July 1947) is a documentary filmmaker, writer and critic, working mostly in France and the UK. His award-winning films include portraits of Cary Grant, John Adams (composer), Elvis Costello, Boy George, Ravi Shankar, Rod Stewart, Bill Viola, Iannis Xenakis, pianists Alfred Brendel and Leon Fleisher, Derek Jarman, Balthus, Tricky, Robert Wyatt and American theatre and opera director Peter Sellars. A pioneer of the \\"rockumentary\\", Kidel was also the first rock critic of the New Statesman and contributed pieces on rock, soul, and world music, to The Observer, The Sunday Times, and The Guardian. Early life Kidel grew up in Paris and Vienna and attended the Lyc√©e fran√ßais de Vienne and Bedales School in England. In 1965, he won a scholarship to the University of Oxford where he studied for a BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at New College, graduating in 1968, and edited Isis, the renowned student weekly. During his tenure, Kidel interviewed Jimi Hendrix on his first UK tour with Emma Rothschild. Kidel subsequently earned a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1969 with an MA in International Relations. Early film and television career In 1970 Kidel got a job at the BBC in London as a researcher in the General Features department. There he made his first 10-minute film (about cheap weekend holidays to Majorca), and in 1972 joined the production team on the newly formed BBC2 Saturday night program Full House later known as Second House and The Lively Arts. There he made longer film portraits of a variety of British artists and craftsmen. He followed with the feature-length The Man They Couldn't Hang: Babbacombe Lee for the BBC with the folk-rock group Fairport Convention. In 1975 Kidel made a cin√©ma v√©rit√© film about the Kursaal Flyers as they toured Britain in a Ford Transit van called So You Wanna Be a Rock 'N' Roll Star? Recognized as a pioneering rock doc (listed in Time Out's 50 Best Music Films, for example) this now classic inspired British comedians' group the Comic Strip's Bad News Tour which some believe in turn inspired Rob Reiner's This is Spinal Tap. Kidel's next film, another classic rock doc, Rod the Mod Has Come of Age is a ruthless account of the rock promotion circus in full action. In early 1976, Kidel was in charge of \\"Arena: Art and Design\\", one of the precursors of the still running Arena series. During his six-month editorship, \\"Arena\\" featured an entire program devoted to video art, the then-relatively new art movement. Dartington Hall and work with James Hillman Frustrated by what he saw as television's increasing superficiality and the professional pressure to make formulaic films to please as wide an audience as possible, Kidel left the industry altogether in 1976 to work in communications and PR for the Dartington Hall Trust in Devon for the next decade. Dorothy Whitney Elmhirst and her husband Leonard's unique nonprofit foundation was influenced by Rabindranath Tagore and served as an experiment in rural reconstruction which included projects in education, agriculture, rural industry and the arts. Kidel also taught in the music department at Dartington College of the Arts for three years. Kidel was director of the \\"New Themes for Education\\" conference held at Dartington Hall for the years from 1984 to 1986. During this time, the conference explored the experience of illness and brought together people from the worlds of medicine, psychology and the arts. The 1985 conference led to Kidel's co-editing with Susan Rowe-Leete,'The Meaning of Illness (Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1986). Kidel invited James Hillman to Dartington Hall in 1984 to run a weekend seminar on animals in myths, dreams and fairy tales. Following this they collaborated, with Susan Rowe- Leete, on seven films based on Hillman's ideas: -The Heart Has Reasons: a film about the way in which the heart is imagined by scientists and poets -Kind of Blue: an essay in defence of melancholia -The Architecture of the Imagination: a series of five ground-breaking films, 30-minutes each, about architecture and symbolism, with ones about the doorway, the staircase, the window, the tower and the bridge. The films included many examples drawn from the history of art and classic cinema. Music criticism From 1972 to 1976, Kidel wrote music reviews for Time Out's music section. During his time in Devon and onwards, Kidel also focused more on writing about contemporary music, specifically rock, folk, soul, R&B;, blues, and world music, contributing pieces to The Observer, The Sunday Times, The Guardian and the New Review. He was the founding rock columnist for the New Statesman in 1976 through 1980 and alternated every other week with John Peel on a regular column in The Listener. WOMAD Kidel and Peter Gabriel, with whom he had become friends after interviewing him for The Observer, discovered they were both interested in exploring music from other cultures. This led to a collaboration on the creation of a world music and rock festival that eventually became WOMAD. Kidel fed ideas which came from looking at successful world music festivals in France, the yearly event in Rennes, run by Ch√©rif Khaznadar and Fran√ßoise Gr√ºnd. Kidel was on the first board of directors but resigned owing to other commitments. A group that included Jonathan Arthur, Thomas Brooman, Martin Elbourne, Bob Hooton, and Steve Pritchard eventually brought the festival to fruition in 1982. Return to television In 1987, Kidel returned to television: That year, he worked as joint commissioning editor-in-chief for the inaugural broadcast of the French cultural channel La Sept ‚Äì later known as ARTE France. He also worked as a consultant to Channel 4, BBC Wales, and United Television, a large UK-based independent producer of TV programmes, through 2004. Kidel also produced and directed many films from 1987 until the present, working in collaboration with a number of production companies, in the UK ‚Äì Dibb Directions, Third Eye and Antelope Films ‚Äì in France with Les Films d'ici, and Agat Films & Cie ‚Äì Ex Nihilo and also a regular guest producer with the BBC's Music and Arts Department. One notable project involved collaborating with British producer and director Mike Dibb and the world-renowned US ethno-musicologist Alan Lomax ‚Äì creating two films for Channel 4 out of 500 or so hours of material he had shot in the United States over a 10-year period: American Patchwork and Dreams and Songs of the Noble Old.A slightly recut version of the Channel Four documentary can be seen at http://www.folkstreams.net/film,127. Many of Kidel's most successful films in the field of world music and cultures have been the result of collaborations with distinguished specialists: Le Paris Black and Pygmies in Paris with French music writer (and ex-editor of Jazz Magazine) G√©rald Arnaud, Under African Skies: Mali and Bamako Beat with ethnomusicologist and BBC broadcaster Lucy Dur√°n , and New York:, The Secret African City with the great Africanist at Yale University, Robert Farris Thompson. A more intimate way of working A major shift occurred in Kidel's work starting in 1997: he started shooting his own films. The intimacy achieved in \\"Naked and Famous\\", his film about Tricky, owed a great deal to this new low-impact approach. Subsequently, Kidel shot many of his own films or the parts of them using this approach. Current work Kidel founded Calliope Media in 2003. He also continues to work as a freelance director, mainly in the UK and France. Recent films include 'Becoming Cary Grant' (2017), Official Selection, Cannes Festival 2017, 'The Juilliard Experiment'(2016), a feature-length film about the French artist Fabienne Verdier's collaborations with musicians in New York. Current projects include a feature documentary about Leonard Cohen, co-written with Sylvie Simmons, author of the acclaimed biography and 'I'm You Man, a film about the French pianist Shani Diluka as well as other music and arts projects. He has continued to work as a freelance writer, notably for Dasha Zhukhova's art magazine Garage and Doris Lippitsch's architecture and design magazine QUER. He is a regular contributor on music, film and theatre for The Arts Desk, an online review of the arts founded in September 2009 by a group of freelance arts writers.

From 1948, the hospital catered for both patients with chest ailments (including tuberculosis) and mental health patients, and in 1972 the facility was renamed 'Hawkmoor Hospital' and dealt solely with mental health problems until its closure in 1987. History Wards at Hawkmoor Hospitals The hospital, which formed part of a nationwide network of sanatoria designed for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis and made possible by central government grants worth ¬£1.5 million awarded under the Finance Act 1912, opened in 1913. The sanatorium initially opened in temporary accommodation with 40 beds available. The main building not completed until over a year later. Training of nurses was shared by arrangement with the Royal Cornwall Infirmary in Truro. After the sanatorium joined the National Health Service in 1948, the scope of treatment offered was expanded to include all pulmonary disorders as well as the acceptance of mental health services. It opened a specialist thoracic surgery unit and also offered services to treat conditions such as sarcoidosis and pulmonary carcinoma from 1950. In 1972, the pulmonary diseases facilities were withdrawn and the hospital became a facility specialising in mental disorders and was renamed 'Hawkmoor Hospital'. The hospital closed in 1987 and the site has since been redeveloped for residential use as Hawkmoor Parke. Location and transport From 1931 until 1959, Hawkmoor was also served by a railway station on the Moretonhampstead and South Devon Railway with a station originally called Hawkmoor Halt, but later changed to be called Pullabrook Halt. The railway station was simple with a platform constructed of sleepers and a small waiting room, and was frequently used by visitors to the hospital. Whilst only 3/4 mile directly from the station to the hospital, the distance required to be travelled was more than double that.

Early life The second son of the Rev. Henry Patteson of Drinkstone, Suffolk, by his wife, Sophia, daughter of Richard Ayton Lee, a London banker, he was born at Coney Weston, Suffolk, on 11 February 1790. He was at first educated at a school kept by his father's curate, a Mr. Merest, and then went to Eton College; his name first appears in the school lists in 1802, and in 1808 he was elected on the foundation. John Sumner was his tutor. In 1809 Patteson went with a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, which, under the then existing privileges of king's scholars, entitled him to graduate without examination. He accordingly graduated B.A. in 1813, and M.A. in 1816. His university career was, however, distinguished. When the Davies university scholarship for classics was established, he was, in 1810, the first to win it, and in 1812 he was elected a Fellow of his college. Legal career In 1813 Patteson entered the Middle Temple. In 1815 he went on the midland circuit as marshal to Sir Alan Chambr√©, read in the chambers of Godfrey Sykes, and of Joseph Littledale. In 1821 he began practice as a special pleader, and was called to the bar in the same year. He joined the northern circuit, and there, in competition with Edward Hall Alderson and James Parke, came to the fore in pleading. He was soon assisting Littledale in his work as counsel to the treasury. His progress was rapid, with his best argument said to have been in Rennell v. the Bishop of Lincoln. He was one of the legal commissioners on the reform of the Welsh judicature, whose report led to the act of 1830, by which three additional judges were appointed‚Äîone in the king's bench, one in the common pleas, and one in the exchequer; and, though he had never been a King's Counsel, Lord Lyndhurst, in November, appointed him to the new judgeship in the court of king's bench, and he was knighted. Deafness led Patteson to resign at the end of January 1852. On 2 February 1852 he was sworn of the privy council, and for some years served as a member of its judicial committee. Patteson also acted as a commissioner to examine into the state of the City of London in 1853, was frequently chosen arbitrator in government questions‚Äîsuch as disputes between the Crown and Duchy of Cornwall, and between the Post Office and the Great Western Railway‚Äîand his award terminated a long-standing rating dispute between the university and the town of Cambridge. Failing health at last put an end to Patteson's judicial work. He died on 28 June 1861 at Feniton Court, Honiton, Devon, which he had purchased in 1841. Patteson edited, in 1824, John Williams's Notes on Saunders's Reports. Family Patteson was twice married: first, on 23 February 1818, to his cousin Elizabeth, daughter of George Lee of Dickleburgh, Norfolk, by whom he had one daughter; and after her death on 3 April 1820, he married, on 22 April 1824, Frances Duke, daughter of James Coleridge and sister of John Taylor Coleridge, who died on 27 November 1842. One of their sons, John Coleridge Patteson, was ordained in the Church of England, became a missionary and the first Bishop of Melanesia, and, after his martyrdom in 1871, is remembered annually on the liturgical calendar on 20 September.

Condition A condition assessment of the monument was conducted by McKay Lodge Conservation Laboratory. They found several condition issues some originating from the poor quality of the original cast and others due to climate. The condition problems included casting porosity, patches and plugs, chill cracks, weaknesses in armature, and a general need for cleaning.

MetroBus Work for the Metrobus express bus services began in 2015. Service on the first of three routes ‚Äì from Emersons Green in the northeast, to the city centre ‚Äì commenced in May 2018. The route from Long Ashton in the southwest is expected to begin in autumn 2018, and the north-south route, from Cribbs Causeway to Hengrove Park, in January 2019. Greater Bristol Bus Network The greater Bristol bus network (GBBN) is a scheme by the West of England Partnership, to improve 12 bus corridors across the greater Bristol area. Bristol Airport expansion Bristol Airport created plans for an extension but in October 2007 the airport announced that it would delay the planning application until the middle of 2008 to complete research on the airport's effect on the environment. This news came just a week after the World Development Movement stated that flights from the airport generate the same amount of CO2 as the nation of Malawi.[15] Plans for the expansion of the airport have been now completed and are to be submitted to the council for approval in summer 2008. A coalition to fight the expansion, known as Stop Bristol Airport Expansion was formed by Bristol Friends of the Earth, Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) and other groups and individuals in North Somerset, Bristol and Bath and North East Somerset. In early 2008, an opposition to the Stop Bristol Airport Expansion campaign was launched to support the expansion and operations of the airport. Named BISON ‚Äì Bristol International Supporters Group ‚Äì it is targeted at the travelling public. A decision was due on 3 March 2010 after a meeting at Weston-super-Mare Town Hall, on 24 May permission was granted by the council. As part of the expansion, planning permission was also granted for a 251-room hotel, which was scheduled to open in 2012. However in 2014, the plans were revised and reapproved instead for a 201-room hotel, which will in the future include the addition of 50-rooms. Construction began on the airport hotel in 2015 with the hotel expected to be completed in 2016. MetroWest The MetroWest scheme, previously known as The Greater Bristol Metro, is a proposal to improve the rail services in Greater Bristol. It was first proposed at First Great Western's Stakeholder Event in March 2008, and received political backing in 2012. The scheme include the reopening of the Portishead Line and increasing train frequency on the Severn Beach Line as part of phase 1; the reopening of the Henbury line and increasing train services to Yate in phase 2. Light rail or rapid transit The Bristol and Bath Railway Path is proposed to have a light rail line running alongside the pedestrian and cycling paths In November 2016, the West of England Local Enterprise Partnership began a consultation process on their Transport Vision Summary Document, outlining potential light rail/tram routes from the city centre to Bristol Airport, the eastern and north west fringes of the city, and a route along the A4 road to Bath. In July 2017 a leaked draft of that document, due to be published in October 2017, suggested an underground rail network around the most built-up areas of the city as one of many solutions to congestion equating to ¬£8.9billon. In September 2017, incumbent mayor, Marvin Rees vocally supported the creation of an underground line in the city. The service would run from Bristol Airport to Temple Meads, the centre and north of Bristol and then to Cribbs Causeway, and would cost an estimated at ¬£2.5bn. The city council commissioned a ¬£50,000 study to determine the financial viability of the project and Rees has suggested ¬£3m for a geological survey. As of 2019, four mass transit lines are proposed (with technology type and exact routes to be determined): * Bristol to Airport ‚Äì connecting the city centre, South Bristol, and the Airport. * Bristol to North Fringe ‚Äì connecting the city centre, North Bristol, Southmead Hospital, Cribbs Causeway. * Bristol to East Fringe ‚Äì connecting the city centre, East Fringe and East Bristol. M4 Junction at Emersons Green It has been long proposed for there to be a motorway junction linking the A4174 road (Avon ring road) to the M4 motorway near to Emersons Green as they pass very close. It has attracted support from the Kingswood MP Great Western Main Line electrification As part of Crossrail the Great Western was already planned to be electrified from Airport Junction to Maidenhead but, following a number of announcements and delays the government announced in March 2011 that the line would be electrified between London and Cardiff together with the section linking Bristol Parkway and Bristol Temple Meads. It is scheduled to be completed by 2017. South Bristol ring road There have been several proposals to extend the ring road from the junction with the A4 at Hicks Gate, Keynsham, along the southern edge of Bristol as far as the A370 at Long Ashton. The 2005 Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study, commissioned by the regional government office, recommended construction of the new southern route to tackle congestion. The proposals follow the route set aside west from Hengrove Park roundabout to the A38 at Castle Farm (phase 1), and from there to the A370 near Long Ashton Park and Ride (phase 2). There are additional recommendations (phase 3) for a new Whitchurch bypass from Hengrove Park roundabout, along the base of Dundry Hill, around Stockwood and joining the existing A4174 at Hicks Gate roundabout on the A4.Atkins, 2005. \\"Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study .\\" Chapter 6. Phase one and two of the ring road are the only major road building schemes adopted by the Joint Local Transport Plan, which claimed they would reduce delays across the Greater Bristol area by 6%, and lead to a 9% increase in public transport use.B&NES;, Bristol City, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire councils, 2006. \\"Joint Local Transport Plan .\\" Chapter 6. (PDF) Bristol City Council has endorsed all three phases, and was hoping to begin construction of the first two phases in 2010 and 2011, and the third phase some time after 2016. However, the plan had not been approved by the Department for Transport. In January 2015, the Department for Transport approved plans for the construction of the South Bristol Link road, as part of the MetroBus rapid transit scheme. Construction began in late 2015 and was completed in early 2017.

She is known as the founder of the nursery school in France.  Early years  Pauline Reclus was born in Bordeaux in 1838. Her father was Jean Reclus, inspector of schools of the Gironde. Her uncle, Jacques Reclus, taught at the Protestant college of Sainte-Foy-la-Grande. She spent her infancy with her aunt Z√©line in Orthez. On returning to Bordeaux she was a student at a secular institution that became the √âcole normale of Gironde. She became a public school teacher in the Gironde. She married Jules Duplessis-Kergomard, a penniless man of letters with little interest in working.  Career  In 1879 Pauline Kergomard was appointed general delegate for inspection of asylums, with the support of Ferdinand Buisson. She was named to the post by Jules Ferry. She was inspector-general of kindergartens from 1881 until 1917. She was extremely active, attending conferences, dealing with regional and national authorities and campaigning against child poverty and for women's causes. She traveled throughout France, inspecting schools and communicating her educational philosophy based on respect for the child and the search for fulfillment. Pauline Kergomard and Charles Defodon co-edited the Ami de l'enfance, the organ of the French maternal educational system. In 1884 the French Chamber's budget commission considered eliminating all inspectresses general of nursery schools. The L'Ami de l'enfance raised the alarm. Defodon praised the inspectorate as a French tradition that made use of women's distinctive maternal talents. Caroline de Barrau noted that nursery schools had been founded as an initiative of women which the state then chose to support. She disparaged the regime by comparison to its predecessors, who had introduced inspectresses general. The unsatisfactory compromise was to dismiss or retire four of the inspectresses and retain the other four. From 1886 to 1892 Kergomard was a member of the higher council of public education. Her work led to reform of asylums and the creation of kindergartens with a completely new and secular system of education. She attended the 1896 International Feminist Congress in Paris, presided over by Marie Bonnevial, which discussed coeducation. The Pr√©vost orphanage, the first mixed school in France, received much attention. She and L√©opold Lacour were able to obtain agreement on the final resolution, in favor of changing to a coeducational system in all countries. In 1897 she co-founded the \\"People's Union\\" with Ferdinand Buisson, Maurice Bouchor, √âmile Duclaux and Th√©odore Steeg.

History This genus was created in 1975. Before this date the species of this genus were confused with Toxoplasma gondii to which they are closely related. The canid-infecting species, H. heydorni and H. triffittae, have been split into new genus Heydornia based on the molecular phylogenetic analysis. Life cycle The species in this genus have two vertebrate hosts in their life cycle: a felid (the definitive host) and prey species (the intermediate host), which vary and depend on the local fauna but include mice, deer and others. In the gastrointestinal tract of the definitive host the parasite undergoes sexual reproduction, forms a zygote which after some divisions forms a cyst that is excreted. The cyst is subsequently ingested by the prey species in whom the parasite decysts and invades its tissues wherein it again multiplies and encysts. After ingestion of the tissues of the prey species by the definitive host the parasite again decysts and multiplies. It also undergoes sexual reproduction before encysting again.

Following the predominant world music slant of 2008's Susquehanna and the 2009 ska album Skaboy JFK, White Teeth, Black Thoughts marks the Cherry Poppin' Daddies' first album since their 1997 compilation Zoot Suit Riot to focus exclusively on swing and jazz music, eschewing the ska, rock and pop influences which typically feature on their albums. A two-disc \\"deluxe\\" version of White Teeth, Black Thoughts was released concurrently with the main swing album, featuring an additional full-length album of material composed in an \\"Americana\\" vein covering rockabilly, country and western swing. Album overview =Music= Since plans for a new record were announced, singer/songwriter Steve Perry stated the primary musical direction of the next Daddies album would be returning to swing and jazz music, the band's first swing-oriented album since their 1997 breakthrough compilation Zoot Suit Riot. White Teeth, Black Thoughts features few of the ska and punk influences which the Daddies are generally recognized for incorporating into their swing music, instead primarily drawing from various periods of traditional jazz and swing, including the hot jazz of the 1930s and the jump blues and big band of the 1940s and 1950s. A limited \\"deluxe edition\\" of White Teeth, Black Thoughts was co-released alongside the main album, featuring a bonus disc of additional material which Perry explained didn't fit into the stylistic context of the swing album. Heavily influenced by various facets of Americana music, the songs on the bonus disc cover such styles as zydeco (\\"Tchoupitoulas Congregation\\"), country (\\"You Wiped Your Ass With My Heart\\"), western swing (\\"Peckerheads & Badasses\\") and bluegrass (\\"Ragged Ol' Flag\\"), as well as several songs influenced by rockabilly. Elaborating on the band's interpretation of the latter, Perry explained \\"[it's] kind of like psychobilly with horns...[i]t's like the swing stuff we deal with, it's a little straighter, but with still a swung beat and then some heavy guitar and some R&B; and swing elements in there\\". White Teeth, Black Thoughts is the first Daddies studio album since 1994's Rapid City Muscle Car to include cover songs, and the first time the band has recorded songs from the swing era. While Perry has long been a critic of cover songs and in particular the overuse of covers in swing bands, he explained in an interview, \\"If we do a cover...we do it because we believe people won't recognize it rather than will. I would want to draw attention to an artist that is historically out there on the cobblestones\\". The main album features covers of Louis Jordans 1939 song \\"Doug the Jitterbug\\", Wynonie Harriss 1950 rhythm and blues version of Hank Pennys \\"Bloodshot Eyes\\" and Bull Moose Jacksons 1947 \\"I Want a Bowlegged Woman\\", while the bonus disc includes a French-language cover of Django Reinhardts \\"Nuages\\" and a cover of \\"Flat Butts and Beer Guts (Or How I Learned to Vomit Standing Up)\\" by New York cowpunk band the Barnyard Playboys, from their 2000 album Dumbass on a Rampage. =Lyricism= In a June 2013 interview with Parade magazine, Perry briefly mentioned that he was inspired to start writing material for White Teeth, Black Thoughts during the financial crisis of 2007-08, drawing a parallel with the Great Depression of the 1930s which prompted him to return to writing swing and jazz music. In a later interview, Perry elaborated on these influences, calling the album \\"an Americana examination of those Bush into Obama years and financial hard times\\", focusing on an amalgam of the social and political issues of the time, including \\"Red State anxiety (i.e. Tea Party/Fox News phenomenon), growing class warfare (i.e. Wall Street/hedge fund), American materialist/capitalist values [and] the pain of nostalgia. I guess I wanted little vignettes and character sketches that would freeze this time period in amber, so to speak\\". Production history In a July 2010 interview conducted while the Daddies were still touring behind the release of Skaboy JFK, Perry hinted at prospective plans for new Cherry Poppin' Daddies material, mentioning the band was in the process of writing music for possibly two new albums, one \\"a swing- rockabilly kind of thing\\" and the other \\"an R&B...pop; thing\\". By the following January, however, Perry clarified that the swing album had become the band's sole focus, though elements of the R&B; project would eventually contribute to the development of White Teeth, Black Thoughts bonus disc. Buckwheat Zydeco was one of several guest musicians appearing on White Teeth, Black Thoughts. Initial production on the album began in March 2011 at Gung Ho Studios in the Daddies' hometown of Eugene, Oregon, where all of the band's previous studio albums have been recorded. Documented through Perry's personal Twitter account, this stage of production lasted throughout most of 2011, with recording lasting into summer, tracking finished by October and mixing taking place over the following months. These recording sessions marked the debuts of guitarist Bill Marsh and tenor saxophonist Willie Matheis, both of whom joined the Daddies in 2010, as well as trombonist Joe Freuen, who would later join the band in 2012 as their first full-time trombone player. This would also be the final Daddies album to feature longtime keyboardist Dustin Lanker, who would leave the band in early 2012. Much like Susquehanna, White Teeth, Black Thoughts features an extensive roster of guest musicians, primarily contributing instruments unique to the genres being performed. Most notably, the album features appearances by Grammy Award-winning accordionist Buckwheat Zydeco on the zydeco-styled song \\"Tchoupitoulas Congregation\\", and Captain Beefheart and The Magic Band guitarist Zoot Horn Rollo, a Eugene resident and personal friend of Perry's, on the psychobilly cover \\"Flat Butts and Beer Guts\\". John Fohl, a former member of Dr. Johns Lower 911 band and Daddies guitarist from 1990‚Äì1992, provided baritone and slide guitar for the western swing track \\"Peckerheads and Badasses\\". Although the band originally announced a projected release date of winter 2011, updates on the album's development went entirely unheard of until a December 2011 interview with Perry, where he vaguely mentioned continued work on the album but finally confirmed its title, White Teeth, Black Thoughts. Perry later revealed that following initial completion of recording in late 2011, the band ultimately decided to record an additional batch of songs and release an exclusive version of White Teeth, Black Thoughts as a double album. According to Perry, he had simply written \\"so many damn songs\\" in both the swing and rockabilly/Americana genres that he thought it better to split them into two separate albums rather than attempt to merge the two styles into something stylistically cohesive. On June 20, 2012, the Daddies launched a PledgeMusic campaign accepting fan donations to help complete the final stages of production, reaching 100% on August 14 and continuing to collect further donations into 2013, ultimately raising 133% of its target sum. Perry announced through a PledgeMusic update on November 16, 2012, that the album and its artwork had been completely finished. Release and promotion On March 18, 2013, a digital download of the 11-track swing album was released exclusively for contributors to the Daddies' PledgeMusic campaign, while signed physical copies of the single and double-disc CDs were mailed out in the following weeks. The Daddies eventually confirmed a wide release date of July 16 for both versions of White Teeth, Black Thoughts in April, releasing the album's first single and video, \\"I Love American Music\\", on May 15, and the second, \\"The Babooch\\", on July 2. On July 8, Billboard released a full stream of the swing album on their website. Both CD versions of the album were released on July 16 along with a limited vinyl release of the swing album, the first Daddies album since 1990's Ferociously Stoned to be issued on vinyl. Having retired from full-time touring after their hiatus in late 2000, the Daddies carried out a short fifteen-city tour in support of White Teeth, Black Thoughts, primarily playing within the West Coast and New England. In the midst of the tour on July 25, the band appeared on the Fox- owned KTTV program Good Day L.A., performing the song \\"I Love American Music\\" in promotion of their show at the Roxy Theatre in Hollywood that same evening. =Music videos= Five music videos were filmed in promotion of White Teeth, Black Thoughts, shot by Steve Perry and the Daddies in conjunction with the Bend, Oregon-based production company AMZ Productions. \\"I Love American Music\\", the first single/video off the album, was premiered on The Onions A.V. Club website on May 15, 2013, while the song was released to iTunes and Spotify on May 20. In a blog post released the same day, Perry elaborated at length behind the song and the video, noting that it was written as a tribute to the unknown blues musicians he idolized who remained dedicated to their music despite living in poverty and obscurity, while the video reflects how the same dedication affects an musician's family life, describing it as \\"a Sisyphean struggle with more downs than ups\\". The video, directed by Perry and Jesse Locke, humorously depicts Perry at his home, intently composing and singing along to the song while his frustrated wife stands to the sidelines. On July 2, the album's second video, \\"The Babooch\\", was premiered on USA Today. Again directed by Perry and Locke, the video had a decidedly political tone, featuring the Daddies performing the song while super-imposed over a montage of postcards and stock film, intercut with footage of bourgeoisie luxury and figures including Henry Paulson, Donald Trump and Mitt Romney with news footage of Occupy Wall Street and American homelessness. Perry described the video as being inspired by \\"punk rock clip posters\\", Frank Zappas 200 Motels and Luis Bu√±uels The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, while noting the song was about a Gatsby-esque \\"one-percenter self-importantly celebrating his success\\", \\"the most American character, seduced by luxury but pricked by conscience\\". The album's third music video, \\"Huffin' Muggles\\", debuted on the website for gay and lesbian magazine Out on August 27, 2013. Depicting Perry dressed in drag and several members of Eugene, Oregon's drag community, Perry described the song as an homage to the Warhol superstars, namely Candy Darling, Jackie Curtis and Holly Woodlawn, as well as actress Maria Montez and the filmmaking style of experimental director Kenneth Anger. In addition to \\"huffing muggles\\" being 1930s/1940s slang for smoking marijuana, Perry elaborated on the meaning of the song by calling it \\"like an ear to the door of a casual conversation between an old experienced 'urbane' male and his younger acolytes with whom he is holding court. There is a lot of shit talking going on, and everyone is 'getting loose'\\", highlighting the lyrical references to William Blakes Songs of Innocence and of Experience and noting \\"[w]hat I was really interested in here was the kind of cultural apprenticeship angle, and the bittersweet generosity behind the transferring of hard won cultural knowledge\\". On April 25, 2014, a week before the May 2 European release of White Teeth, Black Thoughts, the Daddies released their fourth video for \\"Doug the Jitterbug\\", a cover of a 1939 Louis Jordan song. Unlike the album's previous videos, \\"Doug the Jitterbug\\" didn't feature a narrative, but was instead a filmed live performance in black-and-white of the Daddies performing the song at the Whiteside Theatre in Corvallis, Oregon on September 21, 2012, occasionally interspersed with clips of vintage films and cartoons. On October 20, 2015, over two years after the album's release, Perry posted a music video for the song \\"Brown Flight Jacket\\" to the band's YouTube account. In a Facebook post, Perry revealed the video was shot the same day as the video for \\"The Babooch\\", but \\"[he] forgot to put it out there for the world to enjoy\\". Similar in aesthetic style to \\"The Babooch\\", the video depicts Perry wandering across a desert landscape singing the song, intercut with vintage footage of World War II bombers. Reception Critical response to White Teeth, Black Thoughts was generally favorable, though, like Susquehanna five years prior, the album's independent release and distribution flew under the radar of most major music publications. PopMatters gave the album a 7 out of 10 rating, considering it to be a superior effort over Zoot Suit Riot, complimenting the band's \\"bizarre/twisted/out of left field sense of humor\\" and agility at \\"slinky, slow-burning numbers\\" such as the title track, though criticized parts of the album they felt steered too close to the sounds of other contemporary swing bands like Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. Pop'stache contributed a glowing review, calling it \\"beautifully recorded\\" and the Daddies' \\"most mature and polished release to date\\", praising their \\"unconventional lyrics, bouncy guitars, and some strange drums\\" in making a \\"contemporary twist on a classic style\\". The Washington Post also gave a positive review, though expressed mixed feelings over the Daddies' \\"modern spin\\" on swing music, writing that most of the songs sounded like \\"contemporary bar-rock songs in a swing style than the work of a retro act\\", though highly praised songs such as \\"Brown Flight Jacket\\" for the \\"tender\\" lyricism and level of subtlety for what the reviewer considered \\"a group that has never seemed to grow out of its bawdy lyrics and rambunctious style\\". Cityview offered a more indifferent opinion, calling the album \\"a solid, well- developed piece of music\\" which was \\"more mature and nuanced than maybe anything the band has previously released\\", though noted that it felt like an \\"album out of time\\" and it was \\"hard to shake the feeling that it's come about a decade too late\\". In a brief 2014 review, Matt Collar of Allmusic rated the album with 3.5 out of 5 stars, summarizing it as \\"an album of exuberant, urbane dance music that moves from popular standards to new compositions with devilish ease\\". Of the few publications to review the double-disc deluxe edition, Ink 19 called the second disc \\"more experimental and generally more fun than the first\\", though recommended both discs as featuring worthwhile material, singling out the \\"touching\\" \\"Brown Flight Jacket\\" and the \\"fun to sing along with\\" \\"Flat Butts and Beer Guts\\". ReadJunk called the album \\"a great swing-influenced album\\", describing the first disc as containing \\"some pretty good swing songs\\", but urged readers to pick up the deluxe version, writing \\"[y]ou'll be missing out an entire disc of great songs if you don't\\".

Poynter was born at 24 Gower Street, Bloomsbury, London. He was eldest son of Sir Edward John Poynter (1836‚Äì1919), and grandson of architect Ambrose Poynter (1796-1886).

Biography Born in Bergamo, Tremaglia grew up assimilating the ideas of the Italian Fascism in his childhood and adolescence. During World War II he fought, at the age of 17, in the National Republican Guard belonging to the Italian Social Republic, a puppet state controlled by Nazi Germany. In the following months Tremaglia lost both parents and was taken as a prisoner by the Allies, then interned in Coltano prisoner-of-war camp for fascist prisoners.

In 2008 he joined The People of Freedom, but in 2010 he followed Gianfranco Fini into his new party Future and Freedom. Tremaglia died at his home in Bergamo, after a long distress with Parkinson's disease. Controversies Tremaglia found himself at the center of a controversy for defending the well-known anti-homosexuality Roman Catholic colleague Rocco Buttiglione, after 2004 European Parliament election, stating: \\"Unfortunately Buttiglione has lost. Poor Europe: fags are among the majority government\\". For this statement Tremaglia was reprimanded and criticized by several members of various parties of the Italian political spectrum.

The figure himself is largely unexpounded, as very few references to him are found in classical texts other than through subtle terms in Chapter 27 of the Qur'an. He is, however, apparent in a number of books that deal with Islamic occultism or Ruhaniyya, and in one that appears to be attributed directly to him (titled, al-Ajnas). In like manner, through the ages he was eminently revered by the Quranic exegetical traditions where the powers he possessed were associated to the Ineffable Name of Allah.Jacob Lassner, Demonizing the Queen of Sheba: Boundaries of Gender and Culture in Postbiblical Judaism and Medieval Islam, University of Chicago Press, 1993, p. 107 Narration The Qur'anic narrative is as follows: > He said, 'O Council, which one of you will bring me her throne, before they > come to me in surrender?' An Ifrit of the jinns said, 'I will bring it to > thee, before thou risest from thy place; I have strength for it and I am > trusty.' Said he who possessed knowledge of the Book, 'I will bring it to > thee, before ever thy glance returns to thee.' Then, when he saw it settled > before him, he said, 'This is of my Lord's bounty that He may try me, > whether I am thankful or ungrateful. Whosoever gives thanks gives thanks > only for his own soul's good, and whosoever is ungrateful -- my Lord is > surely All-sufficient, All-generous.' He said, 'Disguise her throne for her, > and we shall behold whether she is guided or if she is of those that are not > guided.' So, when she came, it was said, 'Is thy throne like this?' She > said, 'It seems the same.' 'And we were given the knowledge before her, and > we were in surrender, Commentary Ibn Kathir's dissertation in Tafsir ibn Kathir: > (One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: ) Ibn \`Abbas said, \\"This > was Asif, the scribe of Sulayman.\\" It was also narrated by Muhammad bin > Ishaq from Yazid bin Ruman that he was Asif bin Barkhiya' and he was a > truthful believer who knew the Greatest Name of Allah. Qatadah said: \\"He was > a believer among the humans, and his name was Asif.\\" (I will bring it to you > within the twinkling of an eye!)

In Kitab al-Kafi, Imam Hasan al-Askari narrates that the greatest name of Allah has seventy three letters and Asif only knew one. With that letter, the land between him and the throne of the Queen of Sheeba shrunk such that he was able to place the throne before Sulayman and the land returned to its original state before the blinking of an eye. He then further states that the Imams of Ahl al-Bayt know seventy two of the letters and the final letter is kept exclusively with Allah as knowledge of the ghaib.

He was a very popular figure on stage, radio and in films, during the 1950s and 1960s. His two daughters, Barbara & Dominique, are artists with their studios in Eze.  Early life  Blanche was born in an artistic family, mainly of stage actors--including his father Louis Blanche--and his uncle, Emmanuel Blanche, who was a painter. He completed his secondary schooling at fourteen, the youngest in France to do so at the time.  Career  In the 1940s and 1950s, Blanche was part of Robert Dh√©ry's theatrical company Les Branquignols, with whom he played in the film Ah! Les belles bacchantes, starring Robert Dh√©ry, Colette Brosset (Dh√©ry's then-wife), and Louis de Fun√®s; directed by Jean Loubignac in 1954. Blanche teamed up with Pierre Dac to form a comic duo best remembered for Le S√¢r Rabindranath Duval, a sketch about a phony and nonsensical Indian clairvoyant and guru (1957). They also created a popular and equally nonsensical radiophonic series, loosely based on a highly improbable espionage and conspiration plot, Malheur aux barbus, which was broadcast on Paris Inter in 213 episodes from 1951 to 1952. The same plot and characters were revived on Europe 1 in a series called Sign√© Furax, enjoying no less than 1,034 daily episodes between 1956 and 1960. Both broadcasts were phenomenal audience successes in the pre-television era. Blanche was also renowned for broadcasting phone pranks, in which he entertained listeners by making the most improbable situations sound plausible. He wrote poems, and the lyrics of 673 songs. On stage, he acted in Tartuffe and N√©ron and, in 1955, Chevalier du Ciel, an operetta by Luis Mariano at the Ga√Æt√©-Lyrique theatre. Blanche also enjoyed a successful cinematographic career, both as an actor and scriptwriter. He appeared as a hard-headed German colonel (\\"Obersturmf√ºhrer Schulz\\") opposite Brigitte Bardot in Babette s'en va-t-en guerre (1959). He was one of the favourite actors of French filmmaker Georges Lautner, and played Ma√Ætre Folace (a shady solicitor counselling a colourful gangster mob) in Les Tontons flingueurs (1963). Blanche also appeared in Boris Vassilief's Les Barbouzes (1964). He delighted in parodying classical music, adapting famous works such as Schubert's \\"Die Forelle\\" (The Trout) into a crazy and slightly risqu√© piece about a 16-year-old romantic girl obsessed with Schubert's song to the point of giving birth to a live trout while performing it on her piano. Similarly, he turned Beethoven's 5th Symphony into a lengthy and quite repetitive musical glorification of the clothes peg and its fictitious inventor, J√©r√©mie-Victor Opdebec. Death and burial Blanche died at the age of 52, from a heart attack with a background of untreated Type 1 diabetes. He is buried in √àze cemetery.

Biography =Early life= Berry and his two brothers were born to parents who sold hardware and settled in Poitou. The family moved to Paris in 1888. Berry completed his studies at the Lyc√©e Louis- le-Grand and then graduated from √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts. =Career= It was during his studies that Berry developed an interest in the theater. Following an audition, he was hired by the Th√©√¢tre Antoine-Simone Berriau to act in La Mort du duc d'Enghien by L√©on Hennique, and Le Perroquet vert by Arthur Schnitzler. Later he performed at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Ambigu- Comique and the Th√©√¢tre de l'Ath√©n√©e. During a tour in Lyon, he was noticed by Jean-Fran√ßois Ponson, who hired him for a period of twelve years at the Th√©√¢tre royal des Galeries Saint-Hubert in Brussels. Audiences in Brussels gave him a warm welcome, where he played in productions such as Le Mariage de mademoiselle Beulemans. Berry subsequently performed in thirty successful plays for Marcel Achard, Alfred Savoir, Louis Verneuil, and Roger Ferdinand. One of Berry's first movie roles was the silent film Oliver Cromwell (1911) directed by Henri Desfontaines. His first appearance in a talking picture was Mon coeur et ses millions (1931) with Suzy Prim. Over the course of his career, Berry acted in eighty-nine motion pictures. Bombastic, extravagant, and whimsical, Berry was as flamboyant as any entertainer of the period, including Pierre Brasseur. Berry is often considered one of the greatest actors in the history of French cinema. Among Berry's best films are: The Crime of Monsieur Lange by Jean Renoir, Les Visiteurs du Soir by Marcel Carn√© (where he was wonderful in the role of the devil), Le Jour Se L√®ve by Marcel Carn√©, Le Voyageur de la Toussaint by Louis Daquin, Baccara by Yves Mirande, 27 Rue de la Paix by Richard Pottier, and L'Habit vert by Roger Richeb√©. Berry ended his film career in 1951 to interpret the texts of Jacques Pr√©vert. =Personal life= Berry was romantically involved with actresses Jane Marken, Suzy Prim, and Josseline Ga√´l. He and Ga√´l had a daughter named Michelle in 1939. A compulsive gambler, Berry frequented casinos and horse races. In April 1951, Berry was admitted to the H√¥pital Broussais, where he died of a heart attack caused by treatment for rheumatism. He is buried in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery (division 80).

Life  Raised in Weston-Super-Mare Littlewood attended Walliscote Primary School and Broadoak Comprehensive moving to London when he was nineteen. On arriving in London he formed a band with his friend Rob Brown called Spongefinger. The band recorded an album's worth of material and released a single called I Love to be Queer. The single was reviewed in the gay press and played in the clubs but failed to chart. Clayton then went back to university and completed a BSc Hons degree in Cultural Studies and an MA in Film and Television. In July 1997 Littlewood went to New York to try and meet Julie Andrews (who was appearing in Victor, Victoria) and give her a song he'd written called Last Night I Dreamt I was Julie Andrews. By the time he got there she had already left the production. Clayton then telephoned Quentin Crisp and spent the day with him (Littlewood describes this meeting in his latest book Goodbye to Soho). In 1998 Clayton hosted a pirate radio station in Brighton posing as a 75-year-old West Country female aromatherapist by the name of Dr Bunty. In 1999 Littlewood wrote a six episode comedy series with Joe Pearson called Roots. It was rejected by a number of agents and broadcasters including the BBC who wrote, \\"This is the most disgusting piece of filth we have ever read. Do not contact us again.\\" Clayton met his partner Jorge Betancourt in South Beach in March 2004. They got married in Provincetown (at the top of the Provincetown Monument) on 28 October 2005. Under the December 2005 ruling of the UK's Civil Partnership Act 2004 Jorge was thus able to move to the UK (Jorge's move to London was one of the first cases that the British Consulate in New York had dealt with). Jorge died in July 2015.  Dirty White Boy  = Shop = In January 2006 Jorge closed down his high fashion menswear Provincetown shop, Dirty White Boy and with Littlewood re-opened it on Old Compton Street in London's Soho. Clayton and Jorge lived below their Soho shop. In August 2006 Littlewood joined Myspace and started a diary/blog charting day-to-day Soho life. It quickly gained a cult following and in 2007, after a number of his stories had been published in The London Paper, Clayton was given a weekly column called 'Soho Stories'. Between 2007 and 2008 Littlewood was invited to appear on BBC Radio London a number of times to read out his stories. However, on two occasions he and his friend, the actor David Benson, were removed from the building for using language that the BBC found to be unacceptable. = Book = In January 2008 Clayton was approached by Cleis Press to turn his blog into a book. Clayton delivered his first reading in February 2008 at the LGBT History Month event called 'Between the Covers' (organised by the House of Homosexual Culture) where readers included Neil Bartlett and Maureen Duffy. Clayton was joined on stage by David Benson who provided the character voices while Clayton narrated. Due to the recession in June 2008 Dirty White Boy (the shop) was declared insolvent. Dirty White Boy: Tales of Soho was published in October 2008 and the book launch was held in Soho's The Colony Room (one of the last events held there before it closed). Reviews compared the book to the diaries of Samuel Pepys and Virginia Woolf and to Christopher Isherwood's Berlin stories. It was named Gay Times Book of the Year (2009) and was endorsed by celebrities such as Elton John, Stephen Fry, Holly Johnson and Sebastian Horsley. Interviewed in Polari Magazine Clayton said, \\"I've always written diaries. I've kept them for years, but just sporadically, during important moments. So when we had the shop I thought, 'This is going to be an important moment'. I had a feeling we weren't going to be there very long, and I wanted to document the period. We were getting all these crazy people coming into the shop, all these mad characters, but I thought rather than just write it as a diary I would post it on MySpace. It was the first time that I'd shown anybody what I had written.\\" In December 2008 Clayton appeared on stage at the Freedom Bar in Soho reading from Dirty White Boy: Tales of Soho alongside Sebastian Horsley. = Play = In April 2009 Clayton turned Dirty White Boy: Tales of Soho into a play. It premiered at the Trafalgar Studios in London's West End and starred Clayton, David Benson and singer Maggie K de Monde, featuring music from Martin Watkins. It sold out. Interviewed in Whatsonstage, Clayton said, \\"I was interested in writing about the real Sohoites. The street people. The pimps. The rent boys. The bag ladies. The hookers. The transsexuals. The old queens. All those on the outside I guess.\\" The play returned a year later, again at the Trafalgar Studios, for an extended run. This time it featured Clayton, David and singer Alexis Gerred. The play was directed by Phil Willmott and received good reviews from Nicholas de Jongh (Evening Standard) and Paul Gambaccini.  Goodbye to Soho  On 10 May 2012 Clayton released a sequel to Dirty White Boy called Goodbye to Soho (DWB Press). The book launch was held at Madame Jojo's in Soho where Clayton read from the book, performed scenes from the play and delivered a dedication to his friend Sebastian Horsley. Clayton was joined on stage by Roger Lloyd-Thompson, Maggie K de Monde and Martin Watkins (Maggie and Martin were launching their album, Union).

He came to prominence for his role as defending counsel in a number of cases involving prominent figures on the far right as well as for his own involvement in right wing politics. Early life Jacques Isorni was the son of Antoine Isorni, a native of Locarno who emigrated to France to make his way an artist in the fashionable Rive Gauche area of Paris, and Marguerite Feine, the daughter of a Catholic family who embraced republicanism and was noted as a Dreyfusard. His parents married only three weeks after they first met and Feine's whirlwind marriage to an immigrant scandalised her traditionalist family.Alice Yaeger Kaplan, The collaborator: the trial & execution of Robert Brasillach, University of Chicago Press, 2000, p. 109 The young Isorni was raised in the high end Faubourg Saint-Germain district, although he found himself a regular target for scorn from his schoolmates due to his Italian roots and unusual surname. Isorni followed his father politically by associating himself with conservatism and whilst attending the Ecole Alsacienne he became involved in groups affiliated to Action Fran√ßaise.Kaplan, p. 110 Legal career before 1945 He studied a joint honours degree in law and literature at the University of Paris and was sworn in as a lawyer in 1931, making him the youngest practising lawyer in France at the time. He quickly built a reputation as a highly innovative lawyer with a high success rate in his cases.Kaplan, p. 114 Following the outbreak of World War II Isorni had a brief period of admiration for Charles de Gaulle, before transferring his allegiance to Philippe P√©tain, arguing that after the Fall of France P√©tain was the country's best hope. A law passed by the Vichy regime however briefly debarred Isorni from continuing in the legal profession as all who were not fully French were barred from practising although before long exceptions were made for \\"prominent\\" lawyers and he returned to the bar.Kaplan, pp. 114-115 Post- war political activity Isorni came to wider prominence in the immediate post-war years when he was chosen to defend Robert Brasillach and then P√©tain himself in their trials for collaboration with Nazi Germany. However Isorni's earlier success rates deserted him as not only were both men found guilty both were also sentenced to death, albeit with the sentence commuted to life in the latter case on account of the Marshal's age and fragile mental state.James Shields, The extreme right in France: from P√©tain to Le Pen, Routledge, 2007, pp. 54-55 Nonetheless Isorni quickly became associated with a new tendency that sought to defend the reputation of P√©tain and the Vichy period and he became a regular writer for Ren√© Malliavin's Ecrits de Paris, a journal dedicated to this cause.Shields, p. 55 Isorni helped establish, and became leader of, the Union des nationaux ind√©pendants et r√©publicains, a political party that supported Petainisme and he ran as a candidate for this group in Paris during the 1951 elections. The group was fairly disparate, being largely a fairly loose coalition of many tiny far right groups that had sprung up in the immediate aftermath of the war.Piero Ignazi, Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe, Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 88 Isorni had initially been reluctant to enter electoral politics but was eventually persuaded to stand as a candidate by Pierre-√âtienne Flandin, who pointed out that Isorni was one of the few prominent Petainists who was not barred from candidacy.Philip M. Williams, Crisis and Compromise: Politics in the Fourth Republic, London: Longmans, 1964, p. 160 Whilst campaigning Isorni had a young Jean-Marie Le Pen as his personal bodyguard.Shields, p. 63 The party failed to capture high levels of support but did manage to get four deputies elected, Isorni among them. Following his election Communist Party members petitioned the Assembly to debar Isorni from membership because of his Vichyist past but the move was rejected.Williams, p. 210 In parliament Isorni came under the wing of the Parti Paysan, a rural conservative group that subsequently formed part of the National Centre of Independents and Peasants, and became known as one of its most vocal, as well as its most right-wing, members. That same year Isorni was also the driving force behind the Association for the Defence of the Memory of Marshal P√©tain, a group that campaign for the \\"Hero of Verdun\\" to be released from prison. A later case saw Isorni defending General Raoul Salan, the leader of the Organisation arm√©e secr√®te, on charges of treason. Although Salan was found guilty of the charge Isorni was able to ensure that he was given a life sentence rather than the standard execution.Shields, pp. 115-116 By this point he had largely left active politics, although he would emerge from time to time to lend his support to electoral candidates, notably Fran√ßois Mitterrand in 1965 and Jean Royer in 1974.Shields, pp. 130, 177 Whilst maintaining rightist views he was by this time identified almost exclusively with anti- Gaullism rather than with any one tendency.Shields, p. 345 References 1911 births 1995 deaths Politicians from Paris Writers from Paris French people of Italian descent National Centre of Independents and Peasants politicians Deputies of the 2nd National Assembly of the French Fourth Republic Deputies of the 3rd National Assembly of the French Fourth Republic European Court of Human Rights cases decided by the Grand Chamber French memoirists Right-wing politicians in France Philippe P√©tain 20th-century French lawyers 20th- century memoirists ","title":"Jacques Isorni"},{"id":"34230448","text":"Milas K.

The Madonna at the FountainThe title is descriptive; the painting was not titled by Jan van Eyck himself. Thus it varies from Virgin with Child at a Fountain (Harbison) to Madonna by the Fountain (Snyder), etc. This article uses the title employed by the holding institution, the Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten Antwerp. is a 1439 oil on panel painting by the early Netherlandish artist Jan van Eyck. It belongs to van Eyck's late work, and is his last signed and dated painting. It retains its original frame, which bears the inscription; \\"ALS IXH CAN\\", \\"JOHES DE EYCK ME FECIT + [COM]PLEVIT ANNO 1439 At 19 x 12 cm. the painting is only a little larger than a postcard. It is set in a hortus conclusus, with the fountain representing the fountain of life.Snyder 99 The Madonna is depicted dressed in blue, her figure framed by a richly embroidered cloth of honor supported by two angels. The Christ Child holds prayer beads in his left hand, suggesting, along with the rose bush behind the figures, the rosary. In the mid to late 15th century the rosary was becoming increasingly popular in northern Europe. This depiction is unusual in that the Madonna wears a blue robe; in the Dresden Triptych, Lucca Madonna, and the Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, van Eyck had depicted her dressed in red. The use of red for the clothes of sacred figures was characteristic of 15th century Netherlandish painting, as cochineal was among the most expensive pigments available for dying textiles. In contrast to this, Italian painters used ultramarine for the robes of Madonnas.Bruns 154-155 Thus van Eyck's choice of blue can be seen as evidence of Italian influence. Byzantine influence Gerard David, Virgin and Child with Four Angels, c. 1510‚Äì15. 63.2 cm √ó 39.1 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art. With the Madonna in the Church in Berlin, this is generally thought to have been one of van Eyck's two paintings of the Madonna and Child from the final years before his death in about 1441. Both show a standing Virgin, in contrast to his earlier treatments of the subject, and the great majority of other painted Virgins. Models for standing Virgins existed in the icons of Byzantine art, and both paintings also represent modified version of the eleusa type, sometimes called the Virgin of Tenderness in English, where the Virgin and Child touch cheeks, and he reaches out a hand.Harbison(1991), p. 158‚Äì162 The Madonna in the Church wears a blue cloak over a red dress. During the early 14th and 15th century a large number of these works were imported into the North, and were widely copied by the first generation of Netherlandish artists, among others. The iconography of both the late Byzantine, typified by the unknown artist responsible for the Cambrai Madonna, and 14th century successors such as Giotto favoured showing the Madonna in a monumental scale, and it is accepted by art historians that van Eyck absorbed these influences, though when and through which works is disputed. It is believed that he had direct exposure to them during his visit to Italy, which occurred either in 1426 or 1428. Van Eyck's two panels carried forward the habit of reproduction and were themselves frequently copied by commercial workshops throughout the 15th century.Jolly (1998), p. 396Harbison (1991), p. 159‚Äì163 It is possible that the Byzantine flavour to these images was also connected with contemporary attempts through diplomacy to achieve reconciliation with the Greek Orthodox Church, in which van Eyck's patron Philip the Good took a keen interest. Van Eyck's Portrait of Cardinal Niccol√≤ Albergati (c. 1431) had depicted one of the diplomats most involved with these efforts, acting for the Papacy.Harbison (1991), p. 163‚Äì167 Copies The image was much copied, with a very high-quality copy assigned to van Eyck's workshop just after the original (Private collection, Maastricht).Evans, no. 353 There is a workshop drawing of the central figures by Gerard David of about 1500‚Äì1510 in the Kupferstichkabinett Berlin, presumably used for his version of the figures, now with four angels and a panoramic landscape background of Bruges, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. This was planned as a precise copy, but the new elements were added while the work was in progress, as modern scientific analysis of the underdrawing shows.Evans, nos. 354 and 355  Citations   References  * Margarete Bruns (1997).

He was also a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly for the 1856 session. Early life and career David K. Noyes was born in Tunbridge, Orange County, Vermont, to Enoch and Mary Ann Noyes. He entered Norwich University in 1842. In 1844, he moved to Iowa County, in the Wisconsin Territory, and mined for lead, becoming associated with future Union Army brigadier general Amasa Cobb. At the outbreak of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War he and Cobb enlisted in a company of volunteers, but they were not needed for the war effort and were never mustered into service. In 1846 he began studying law under David Noggle. He was admitted to the bar in 1847, and became the first practicing lawyer in Baraboo, Wisconsin. In 1855, he established the Baraboo Republic, the first newspaper printed in Baraboo. That same year he was elected to the Wisconsin Assembly for the 1856 session. And later that year he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention. American Civil War At the start of the American Civil War, Noyes volunteered for duty and was commissioned 1st Lieutenant for Company A of the newly established 6th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The Regiment mustered into service in July, 1861, and marched for Washington. Upon their arrival, they were organized with three other regiments from Wisconsin and Indiana under General Rufus King into what would later be known as the Iron Brigade. The brigade was attached to the Army of the Potomac and saw significant fighting in the Northern Virginia and Maryland Campaigns. Noyes was promoted to Captain of the Company, but in the fall of 1862, was severely wounded at the Battle of Antietam when a shell exploded nearby. His right foot was badly damaged and had to be amputated. Noyes returned to Wisconsin and served as chief recruiting officer for the state from January 1863 through July 1864, when he was discharged from service. In February, 1865, however, Noyes returned to the Army as Major of the newly organized 49th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment. They were ordered to western Missouri in March, and Major Noyes had command of the regiment until the arrival of their Lieutenant Colonel in mid-April. He was then assigned to court martial and commission duty in Saint Louis until September. He was honorably discharged with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in November 1865. Postbellum years In 1866, Noyes started another newspaper, The Independent. He was then postmaster for Baraboo from 1867 through 1883, when he retired from active work. He was a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Grand Army of the Republic, and the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Family and personal life On June 18, 1848, Noyes married Lucinda Barnes of Chelsea, Vermont. They had one daughter and three sons. Noyes died at age 80 at his home in Baraboo, November 24, 1900.

The first building was destroyed during the Polish-Swedish war in 1655-1660 (called ‚ÄúThe Deluge‚Äù). The brick and stone palace was founded by the castellan of Krakow, Stanis≈Çaw Warszycki at the end of 17th century (between 1669 and 1681). It was a two-storey baroque building with basements and an attic, covered with a mansard roof. It can be seen as a representation of an entre cour et jardin type of manor. In front of the palace there used to be a court with the entrance gate and behind the building there was a garden situated on the slope of the hill. In the 18th century the palace was owned by the Mƒôci≈Ñski family who redecorated the insides in classicist style. In the 1850s the new owners of the palace were the Poleski family. Micha≈Ç Poleski, scientist and insurgent of the January Uprising in 1863, created a private agronomic school that was located on the second storey of the palace. One of the chambers was changed into a chemistry and physics laboratory, another one contained a library. The school existed here between 1870 and 1880. Probably around the turn of the 20th century the palace was rebuilt in a neogothic style. The last owner of the palace was Countess Maria Elwira O‚ÄôRourke, from a Polish noble family of Irish origin. She left W≈Çodowice probably in 1927 or 1928, selling the palace to a local family. The present condition of the palace is a result of two fires that occurred in 1935 and 1956, along with negligent ownership.  Bibliography  * G√≥rski U.

Artistico played his 9th and last start of the season under new coach Eusebio Di Francesco on 17 January against Lanciano. On 29 January Artistico left for Serie B bottom team Gallipoli with option to co-own the player. Gallipoli relegated and bankrupted at the end of season, while Pescara promoted back to the second division as playoff winner. Despite Artistico scored 0.33 goals per game in his median Serie B season, Di Francesco excluded Artistico from his 2010‚Äì11 Serie B plan.

Coach Gabriele Baldassarri regularly picked Artistico as starting forward (9 rounds, from round 3 to 17) but Artistico failed to score. Since the appointment of Manuele Domenicali as head coach, Domenicali only picked Artistico twice, in round 18 and 21 as starting XI.

It was written by the Scandinavian theologian Jone Salomonsen of the California State University, Northridge and first published in 2002 by the Routledge. Background =Paganism and Wicca in the United States= Contemporary Paganism, which is also referred to as Neo-Paganism, is an umbrella term used to identify a wide variety of modern religious movements, particularly those influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various pagan beliefs of pre- modern Europe.Carpenter 1996. p. 40.Lewis 2004. p. 13. The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or Wicca, was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and is one of several Pagan religions. The figure at the forefront of Wicca's early development was the English occultist Gerald Gardner (1884-1964), the author of Witchcraft Today (1954) and The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as Gardnerian Wicca. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a Horned God and a Mother Goddess, the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a Wheel of the Year and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as covens. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, Raymond Buckland (1934-), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven in Long Island.Hutton 1999 pp. 205-252.Clifton 2006. pp. 24-25 In the U.S., new variants of Wicca developed, including Dianic Wicca, a tradition founded in the 1970s which was influenced by second wave feminism, emphasized female-only covens, and rejected the veneration of the Horned God. One initiate of both the Dianic and Gardnerian traditions was a woman known as Starhawk (1951-) who went on to found her own tradition, Reclaiming Wicca, as well as publishing The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess (1979), a book which helped spread Wicca throughout the U.S.Hutton 1999. pp. 340-351Clifton 2006. pp. 122-123 Prior to Magiocco's work, three American researchers working in the field of Pagan studies had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practicing Wiccan, journalist and political activist Margot Adler in her Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today, which was first published by Viking Press in 1979.Adler 1979.

It was prominently connected with the financing of railroads. History The firm was formed on March 23, 1899 by Harvey Edward Fisk, the son of Harvey Fisk, who was founder of the banking house of Harvey Fisk & Sons. Harvey E. Fisk was a partner in the firm of Harvey Fisk & Sons before he withdrew in 1899 and formed Fisk & Robinson. George H. Robinson was a Stock Exchange member and brought up with Harvey Fisk & Sons. Offices for the firm were at 35 Cedar Street, on the ground floor of the building at the northeast corner of Cedar and William Streets. The firm maintained branch offices in Chicago, Boston, and Worcester. When offices were expanded to the second floor of the building on Cedar Street, it was commented how: \\"This house has made excellent strides within the past few years, and is justly recognized as one of the foremost and most successful firm of private bankers in the city.\\" The firm produced reports, such as the Memoranda concerning United States bonds: prepared for the information of national banks and others (1901), to assist those considering the purchase of United States bonds. A booklet was issued by Fisk & Robinson entitled Concerning Ironmaking. The report provided an overview of the foundations and history of iron and steel making in the U.S. Then the bulletin discussed special features of the Buffalo and Susquehanna Iron Company's plant, positioning Buffalo as an important blast furnace center. In 1905 Fisk & Robinson announced the construction work was begun on a steel viaduct to connect Kansas City, Missouri, with Kansas City, Kansas. The viaduct was one and six-tenths mile long, and crossed the valley of the Kansas River above the network of railroad tracks from several railroads which occupy the river bottom. Fisk & Robinson purchased nearly all of the Panama Canal 2% bonds sold by the Secretary of the Treasury Leslie M. Shaw in July 1906. The bankers were awarded about $17 million out of the total issue of $30 million and later acquired about $10 million more of the bonds from other successful bidders, including Samuel Byerley, then a clerk of the American Express Company, who was allotted $5,800,000 of the bonds. Undertakings which the firm financed in whole or in part included the Gulf & Ship Island Railroad, the Louisiana & Arkansas Railway, the Kansas City Viaduct and Terminal Company, and the Keystone Telephone Company. Among the railroad enterprises that Fisk & Robinson had undertaken was to finance the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad. Large amounts of securities of this railroad were taken by the firm, and in turn pledged for loans from a number of banks in New York City and other places. These securities depreciated in value, with the railroad proving less profitable than had been anticipated. When banks that lent to Fisk & Robinson sought additional security, Fisk & Robinson concluded that for the protection of its creditors, it was best to be placed in bankruptcy. Between 1907 and 1908, Fisk & Robinson came to the aid of Oscar Keen, Merle Middleton, and George Frederick Keen in an effort to buy and sell the Baldwin Locomotive Works, a large manufacturing plant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At the close of banking hours on February 1, 1910, a petition in bankruptcy was filed against the firm in the United States District Court. Bronson Winthrop was appointed receiver by Judge Hand, and immediately took charge of the firm's affairs. A statement issued by Philban, Beekman, Menken & Griscom, counsel to the receiver, placed the liabilities of the firm at a little less than $7,000,000, with estimated assets slightly in excess of that sum. The assets included several large blocks of securities not readily salable. These were ultimately the cause of the failure. Petitioners in the bankruptcy filing were Henry Clark of 318 West 57th Street, John H. Thompson of 400 West 118th Street, and Joseph Stanley-Brown, office manager of the firm. One of the factors that precipitated the bankruptcy of Fisk & Robinson was the death of F.H. Goodyear, who left an estate of about $10,000,000, and who was the chief financial backer of the Buffalo & Susquehanna. George H. Robinson was reinstated to the New York Stock Exchange, and the firm resumed business on December 8, 1910. By 1915, Harvey E. Fisk returned to working with the firm of Harvey Fisk & Sons. The firm formerly known as Fisk & Robinson continued as Robinson & Co.

Data furnaces can theoretically be cheaper than storing computers in huge data centers because the higher cost of electricity in residential areas (when compared to industrial zones) can be offset by charging the home owner for the heat that the data center gives off. Some large companies that store and process thousands of gigabytes of data believe that data furnaces could be cheaper because there would be little to no overhead costs. The cost of a traditional data storage center is up to around $400 per server, whereas the overhead cost per server of a home data furnace is around $10. Individuals had already begun using computers as a heat source by 2011. Usefulness The first kind of data furnace (DF) could be a low cost seasonal DF. This kind of DF would use an existing broadband connection to perform delay-tolerant jobs such as content indexing or the processing of large sets of scientific data. The server will only come on and start heating and processing when the house needs heat. The second kind of DF would be the low bandwidth neighborhood DF. This option can provide faster computations as it can run at all times, but this increases the risk of overheating. To get around this problem there may be vents to the outside added to the server racks to get rid of some of the unneeded heat. The third option would be an eco-friendly urban DF. This option, much like the second, runs year round and can vent excess heat to the outside. This would be an advantage for service providers to expand into urban areas more quickly, so long as the applications scale to the number of servers. This option causes a new challenge, because since it runs year round, the cost of electricity to run the servers cannot be offset by billing the home owners for the heat that they use as it will be little to none.  Technical requirements  For a data furnace heating water, the heating needs to be at least 56¬∞C/ 133¬∞F to prevent the development of pathogens while limiting the risks of skin. Regarding space heating radiators, a temperature of 50-60¬∞C/122-140¬∞F is suitable for a radiator embedding processors as long as the heating surface is of significant size to dissipate the heat. Security There are concerns about the security of these servers, as they would be stored on private properties unmonitored. Unlike traditional data centers that are constantly monitored, data furnaces should be treated as the most insecure environment for data storage. For the best security, each server would have a device to prevent tampering. Furthermore, all of the data on these servers would have to be encrypted so that no one except the person requesting the data would have access to it.  Applications  A few companies around the world are commercialising this concept around the world. A German company Cloud&Heat; offers hot water heated by a distributed data center installed in the premises. French company Qarnot computing developed a radiator that heats with embedded processors and sells the computing power generated.

It is located on Lake Union at 2770 Westlake Avenue North near the Aurora Bridge. It was built in 1912 and named for Richard Wagner, who bought it in the 1950s. Wagner and his wife Colleen later founded the Center for Wooden Boats, which was based out of their houseboat. Today, the Wagner Boathouse represents the transition of South Lake Union from industrial use to a residential community. The houseboat is also one of few remaining relics of the floating resort communities that were once prominent on Lake Washington. As one of Seattle's oldest houseboats, the Wagner Houseboat was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 19, 1982. History thumb The construction of houseboats and other floating structures became popular in the Pacific Northwest during the late 19th century, beginning as cheap shelter for laborers in the lumber and fishing industries. The rowdy behavior of these floating home inhabitants quickly gave houseboats an unfavorable image due to the illegal activity that often took place on the waters edge. The construction of streetcars and cable cars to the Lake Washington waterfront caused houseboats to become associated with wealthier residents, who used them for social gatherings. During the height of their popularity, approximately 4,000 houseboats rested on the waterways in and around Seattle, however those numbers declined to nearly 500 during the 1950s. The Wagner Houseboat was built in 1912 and originally docked near Madison Park. In 1938, the city of Seattle required houseboats on Lake Washington to be connected to sewer lines after installing lines along the shores of the lake. The requirement to add expensive sewer lines caused a mass migration of houseboats from Lake Washington to Lake Union, where there was no sewer requirement until 1967. In 1938, the Wagner Houseboat was towed from Lake Washington to its current location on Lake Union. =Wagners ownership= In the late 1950s, during a summer internship, Dick Wagner \\"fell in love with Seattle\\". At the time, he was an architecture student in New York City where his love for building design flourished. He would walk the streets of New York and admire the historic design of the local architecture. Dick preferred to learn through hands-on experience rather than from a textbook and classroom setting. Upon graduating from both Yale and Columbia, Dick returned to Seattle with a passion to turn Seattle into a national treasure and destination location for tourists. Dick's impression on the waterfront communities of Seattle will be felt forever. He had a passion for teaching others to sail regardless of economic or cultural ability, which led to the creation of the Center for Wooden Boats. His mission was to make sailing accessible to the public and to teach them sailing through hands of experience. Dick died at his home on April 20, 2017. Also a strong advocate for hands-on learning, Colleen had a degree in fine arts and was a talented artist. Along with her husband, Colleen was co-founder of the Center for Wooden Boats with a strong passion for maritime history. Colleen was also founder and Executive Director for the Discovery Modelers Education Center. For her impact on the preservation of maritime history, Colleen was awarded with the Association of King County Historical Organizations' Board Legacy award in 2019. After her husband Dick passed away in 2017, Colleen continued living in the Old Boathouse until she passed away on January 2, 2020. Colleen is remembered for her welcoming spirit and passion for maritime history and preservation. Center for Wooden Boats The Wagner Houseboat was the birthplace of the Center for Wooden Boats. In the late 1950s, Dick and Colleen Wagner began collecting and restoring old wooden boats. As they would work on boats and complete them, they would store their collection behind their home. Using their collection of small wooden boats, the couple decided to create a non-profit boat rental center out of their home by hanging a sign that says, \\"The Old Boathouse\\" on the dock in front of their houseboat. The Old Boathouse officially opened as a non-profit on February 1, 1968. After this, the Center for Wooden Boats museum was born. Eventually, friends of the Wagner's began spending time at their home helping them restore these old wooden boats. This friend group continued to grow both in numbers and in their devotion to preserving the history of wooden boats. This group of came so committed that they would end up staying night after night helping the couple with their restoration process and joining in the effort of the mission created by Dick and Colleen. Once the couple realized the strong devotion of others in the community, it became apparent to the couple that this group of volunteers could support a nonprofit organization guided by their mission. Therefore, on February 3, 1976 Dick and Colleen decided to begin plans to open the Center for Wooden Boats as a way to maintain the history of sailing and wooden boats. This mission also aimed to get anyone and everyone, no matter their physical ability or financial ability, out on the water and given the chance to learn to sail. When the Center for Wooden Boats was officially created, operations were moved out of the Wagner Houseboat and into an official Center for Wooden Boats nonprofit location. The Center for Wooden Boats (CWB) was able to build such a large and committed group of volunteers that other nonprofit leaders around the country have focused on how CWB was able to build such a devoted community and tried to model their success. Currently, close to 75,000 people visit CWB annually to engage in the various maritime actives they provide. Design This photo depicts the dock that the Wagner Houseboat (also known as \\"The Old Boathouse\\") is located off of. The Wagner Houseboat was built as a summer home on Lake Washington near Madison Park. It was designed in the \\"Cottage Style\\" and constructed from locally sourced wood; it reflects historic building techniques of early houseboat design. Another advantage to the Wagner Houseboat construction is the fact that, due to any undesired circumstances, the home can simply be moved to another location along the water. This feature is becoming increasingly desirable because of the rising sea levels and increased flooding across the globe. The Wagner Houseboat was forced to relocate in 1938. If this home was attached to solid ground rather than floating, simply moving the structure from one location to another would have been impossible. This feature of a houseboat construction helps us understand the environmental advantage of floating homes because without its unique floating construction, the inhabitants of the Wagner Houseboat would have had to abandon their home and construct another one in their new location. In a houseboat construction, there is no need to commit to an exact geological location, therefore one can maintain peace of mind knowing they can detach their home and move to a preferred location if needed.

It is a Candidate Recommendation of the W3C working group on Web Application Security, widely supported by modern web browsers. CSP provides a standard method for website owners to declare approved origins of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that website--covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, web workers, fonts, images, embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files, and other HTML5 features. Status The standard, originally named Content Restrictions, was proposed by Robert Hansen in 2004, first implemented in Firefox 4 and quickly picked up by other browsers. Version 1 of the standard was published in 2012 as W3C candidate recommendation and quickly with further versions (Level 2) published in 2014. draft of Level 3 is being developed with the new features being quickly adopted by the web browsers. The following header names are in use as part of experimental CSP implementations: * \`Content-Security-Policy\` ‚Äì standard header name proposed by the W3C document. Google Chrome supports this as of version 25. Firefox supports this as of version 23, released on 6 August 2013. WebKit supports this as of version 528 (nightly build). Chromium-based Microsoft Edge support is similar to Chrome's. * \`X-WebKit-CSP\` ‚Äì deprecated, experimental header introduced into Google Chrome and other WebKit-based browsers (Safari) in 2011. * \`X-Content-Security-Policy\` ‚Äì deprecated, experimental header introduced in Gecko 2 based browsers (Firefox 4 to Firefox 22, Thunderbird 3.3, SeaMonkey 2.1). A website can declare multiple CSP headers, also mixing enforcement and report-only ones. Each header will be processed separately by the browser. CSP can also be delivered within the HTML code using a HTML META tag, although in this case its effectiveness will be limited. Internet Explorer 10 and Internet Explorer 11 also support CSP, but only sandbox directive, using the experimental \`X-Content-Security-Policy\` header. A number of web application frameworks support CSP, for example AngularJS (natively) and Django (middleware). Instructions for Ruby on Rails have been posted by GitHub. Web framework support is however only required if the CSP contents somehow depend on the web application's state‚Äîsuch as usage of the \`nonce\` origin. Otherwise, the CSP is rather static and can be delivered from web application tiers above the application, for example on load balancer or web server. a number of new browser security standards are being proposed by W3C, most of them complementary to CSP: * Subresource Integrity (SRI), to ensure only known, trusted resource files (typically JavaScript, CSS) are loaded from third-party servers (typically CDNs) * Mixed Content, to clarify the intended browser's policy on pages loaded over HTTPS and linking content over plaintext HTTP * Upgrade Insecure Requests, hinting browsers on how to handle legacy links on pages migrated to HTTPS * Credential Management, a unified JavaScript API to access user's credentials to facilitate complex login schemes, * Referrer Policy, CSP extension to hint the browser on generation of the Referer headers. =Bypasses= In December 2015 and December 2016, a few methods of bypassing \`'nonce'\` whitelisting origins were published. In January 2016, another method was published, which leverages server-wide CSP whitelisting to exploit old and vulnerable versions of JavaScript libraries hosted at the same server (frequent case with CDN servers). In May 2017 one more method was published to bypass CSP using web application frameworks code. Mode of operation Mapping between HTML5 and JavaScript features and Content Security Policy controls If the \`Content- Security-Policy\` header is present in the server response, a compliant client enforces the declarative whitelist policy.

In different modern recipes, it is usually made with diced boiled potatoes, carrots, brined dill pickles (or cucumber), green peas, eggs, celeriac, onions, diced boiled chicken or bologna sausage (sometimes ham or hot dogs), and tart apples, with salt, pepper, and mustard added to enhance flavor, dressed with mayonnaise. In many countries, the dish is commonly referred to as Russian salad. A variation called Stolichny salad (, \\"capital city salad\\") exists, and is also popular in the Russian cuisine. In Russia and other post- Soviet states, as well as in Russophone communities world-wide, the salad has become one of the main dishes on zakuski tables served during New Year's Eve (\\"Novy God\\") celebrations. History Hermitage restaurant in the 20th century The original version of the salad was invented in the 1860s by a cook of Belgian origin, Lucien Olivier, the chef of the Hermitage, one of Moscow's most celebrated restaurants. Olivier's salad quickly became immensely popular with Hermitage regulars, and became the restaurant's signature dish. The exact recipe‚Äîparticularly that of the dressing‚Äîwas a zealously guarded secret, but it is known that the salad contained grouse, veal tongue, caviar, lettuce, crayfish tails, capers, and smoked duck, although it is possible that the recipe was varied seasonally. The original Olivier dressing was a type of mayonnaise, made with French wine vinegar, mustard, and Proven√ßal olive oil; its exact recipe, however, remains unknown. Olivier salad prepared with the Hermitage restaurant's recipe At the turn of the 20th century, one of Olivier's sous-chefs, Ivan Ivanov, attempted to steal the recipe. While preparing the dressing one evening in solitude, as was his custom, Olivier was suddenly called away on some emergency. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Ivanov sneaked into Olivier's private kitchen and observed his mise en place, which allowed him to make reasonable assumptions about the recipe of Olivier's famed dressing. Ivanov then left Olivier's employ and went to work as a chef for Moskva, a somewhat inferior restaurant, where he began to serve a suspiciously similar salad under the name \\"capital salad\\" (). It was reported by the gourmands of the time, however, that the dressing on the stolichny salad was of a lower quality than Olivier's, meaning that it was \\"missing something.\\" Later, Ivanov sold the recipe for the salad to various publishing houses, which further contributed to its popularization. Due to the closure of the Hermitage restaurant in 1905, and the Olivier family's subsequent departure from Russia, the salad could now be referred to as \\"Olivier.\\" One of the first printed recipes for Olivier salad, by Aleksandrova, appearing in 1894, called for half a hazel grouse, two potatoes, one small cucumber (or a large cornichon), 3‚Äì4 lettuce leaves, 3 large crayfish tails, 1/4 cup cubed aspic, 1 teaspoon of capers, 3‚Äì5 olives, and 1 tablespoon Proven√ßal dressing (mayonnaise). As often happens with gourmet recipes which become popular, the ingredients that were rare, expensive, seasonal, or difficult to prepare were gradually replaced with cheaper and more readily available foods. Ingredients Advertisement for mogul sauce and other condiments by John Burgess & Son The earliest published recipe known to date appeared in the Russian magazine –ù–∞—à–∞ –ø–∏—â–∞ (Nasha pishcha, \\"Our Cuisine\\") No. 6 (31 March 1894). This magazine published from 1891 to 1896, editor M. Ignatiev, stated that the original recipe contained \\"mogul sauce\\" or \\"kabul sauce\\" (along the lines of Worcestershire sauce), manufactured by John Burgess & SonNow owned by the Greencore Group (the brand he reputedly used) and Crosse & Blackwell.John Hicklin (1963) The Illustrated Hand-Book of North Wales: Being the 5th Ed. of Hemingway's Panorama with Revisions and Additions p.254 (advertisement) Some later recipes substituted soy sauce for the mogul sauce. The book –†—É–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∫ –∏–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—é –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤ –∫—É–ª–∏–Ω–∞—Ä–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ (Rukovodstvo k izucheniyu osnov kulinarnogo iskusstva, \\"Guide to the Fundamentals of Culinary Arts\\") (1897) by P. Aleksandrova gave a recipe containing grouse, crayfish, potatoes, cucumber, lettuce, aspic, capers, olives and mayonnaise. The author wrote that veal, partridge or chicken could be substituted but that the authentic recipe contained grouse.\\"–ö –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—É –æ –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º \\"–û–ª–∏–≤—å–µ\\"\\" (2011-02-08) Livejournal (Russian) In post-revolutionary Russia, cheaper ingredients were substituted for the originals: grouse was replaced by chicken or sausage, crayfish by hard-boiled egg, cucumbers, olives and capers by pickled cucumbers and green peas. Earlier, it always included cold meat such as ham or veal tongue, or fish. The mid-20th century restaurant version involved not just vegetables, but also pickled tongue, sausage, lobster meat, truffles, etc. garnished with capers, anchovy fillets, etc. Some versions mold it in aspic. In modern usage, it is usually boiled diced vegetables bound in mayonnaise, with Doktorskaya- type sausage. The most common alternative version, where it is replaced with boiled or smoked chicken, is called Stolichny salad, after Ivanov's version. A multitude of other versions, named, unnamed, and even trademarked exist, but only Olivier and Stolichny salad have entered the common vernacular of post- Soviet states. Modern Olivier Typical Soviet-style Olivier salad Today's popular version of Olivier salad‚Äîcontaining boiled potatoes, dill pickles, peas, eggs, carrots, and boiled beef/chicken or bologna, dressed with mayonnaise‚Äîis a version of Ivanov's Stolichny salad, and only faintly resembles Olivier's original creation. This version was a staple of any Soviet holiday dinner, especially of a Novy God (New Year's Eve) dinner (to the extent that its presence was considered on a par with Soviet Champagne or mandarin oranges), due to availability of components in winter. Even though more exotic foods are widely available in Russia now, its popularity has hardly diminished: this salad was and maybe still is the most traditional dish for the home New Year celebration for Russian people.Russian Salad (Olivier) Festive Russian and post-Soviet states' homemade versions are traditionally up to the cook's whim. While some of the ingredients are considered to be basic and essential, others are either favoured or angrily dismissed as a threat to the supposed authenticity. The biggest Olivier salad, weighing 1841 kg, was prepared in December 2012 in Orenburg. In other countries =Europe= In Serbia Olivier salad is called Russian salad and it is very common on the New Year and Christmas table The salad is widely popular in the Balkans. It is known as —Ä—É—Å–∫–∞ —Å–∞–ª–∞—Ç–∞ (ruska salata) in Bulgaria, Serbia, North Macedonia, and sallat√´ ruse in Albania, both literally meaning \\"Russian salad.\\" It is similarly called œÅœéœÉŒπŒ∫Œ∑ œÉŒ±ŒªŒ¨œÑŒ± (rossiki salata) in Greece and can be found on almost any restaurant's menu. The Bulgarian version of the salad usually consists of potatoes, carrots, peas, pickles and some sort of salami or ham. The Greek version usually contains no meat. In Croatia and Slovenia it is typically prepared without meat, and is usually called francuska salata in Croatian and francoska solata in Slovene, both meaning French salad. In Bosnia and Herzegovina both the ruska salata and francuska salata (which is essentially Russian salad prepared without meat) are very popular, especially during holidays. The Romanian variant, called salatƒÉ de boeuf (\\"beef salad\\"), is considered a traditional dish. It is a combination of finely chopped beef (or chicken) and root vegetables, folded in mayonnaise and finished with murƒÉturi, traditional Romanian mixed pickles. It can be made vegetarian, too. In Czech it is called simply bramborov√Ω sal√°t (potato salad). It consists of boiled and cubed vegetables (potatoes, carrots, parsley and celery root), finely chopped onions and pickles in mayo dressing, often with diced hard- boiled eggs, some kind of soft salami or canned green peas. It is the side- dish of choice to go with schnitzel or breaded carp, staple Christmas meals in the Czech Republic. Poland Polish sa≈Çatka jarzynowa or sa≈Çatka warzywna (\\"vegetable salad\\", often simply called salatka) is always vegetarian, consisting of peas, hard boiled eggs, and the mirepoix, always cut into small cubes, seasoned with mayonnaise, salt, pepper. Recipes usually vary by region (tart apples or pickles can be added) and even by household, sometimes even adding meat (e.g. ham). One such notable exception is sza≈Çot (), a Silesian variety which may include not only boiled potatoes, carrots, peas and boiled eggs, but also bacon, sausages or pickled herring.Marek Szo≈Çtysek, Kuchnia ≈õlƒÖska, Wydawnictwo ≈ölƒÖskie ABC, Rybnik 2003, (in Polish) Such salads are often served on family celebrations, in particular on Christmas Eve (Christmas Eve dishes are very different from the food that is served on Christmas Day). Ensaladilla rusa, Madrid, Spain Ensaladilla rusa (\\"Little Russian salad\\") is widely consumed in Spain where it is served as a tapa in many bars. It typically consists of minced boiled potato, minced boiled carrots, canned tuna, minced boiled eggs, peas, and mayonnaise. This bears some similarity to versions of mac√©doine de l√©gumes froid. In Italy, Insalata russa has the same ingredients. A similar version is also popular in Portugal, where it is called salada russa. It is usually served either as a standalone dish or as a garnish to fish dishes, particularly fish fillets. In Norway, Iceland and Denmark it is called Italian salad and contains carrots and green peas in mayo dressing. Often and most popular is to pair the salad with smoked meat on bread. European cafes and delis often provide an entire range of Olivier-style salads, ranging from passable to gourmet. Additionally, cafeterias, convenience stores, and truck stops sell a number of sub-par factory packaged or locally made versions, mostly extremely simple, using basic ingredients flooded with an abundance of cheap mayonnaise-like dressing. =Asia= Russian salad, Hanoi, Vietnam In Turkey it is known as Rus salatasƒ±. The Turkish version consists of boiled and sliced carrots and potatoes, sliced cucumber pickles, boiled peas and mayonnaise and is sometimes decorated with boiled and sliced eggs, black olives and beet root pickles. It is served as meze and is used as a filling for some sandwiches and kumpir (jacket potato). Another Turkish name for Olivier salad is Amerikan salatasƒ± (\\"American salad\\"), a euphemistic misnomer originating from the Cold War period. Olivier salad () is popular in Iran, where it is usually made with potatoes, eggs, Persian pickled cucumbers, carrots, chicken, peas and mayonnaise, and is frequently had as a sandwich filler.Salad Olivieh - My Persian Kitchen Karachi, Pakistan It is a popular salad in Pakistan and India as well, where it is usually made with potatoes, peas, apples (and/or pineapples) and mayonnaise and is frequently used as a side dish in cafes. Another version of Russian salad is also very popular in Pakistan which bears no resemblance to Olivier salad and instead is a cabbage and apple slaw. Olivier salad is believed to be introduced as a \\"Capital salad\\" or \\"Niislel salad\\" in Mongolia during the Soviet period. It usually consists of minced ham and carrots, minced boiled eggs, minced boiled carrots and potatoes dressed with mayonnaise. It is widely popular amongst Mongolians, especially during the festive seasons. =Latin America= Because of immigration of Italians, Spaniards, and Eastern Europeans, the dish is also very popular in Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador, Peru, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic where it is called ensalada rusa and has been reduced to its minimum: minced boiled potatoes and carrots, green beans and abundant mayonnaise-based dressing. In Argentina it is usually served on its own as a first course, or with a very thinly sliced beef wrapping called matambre, in a dish called matambre con rusa. Argentinians of Eastern European Jewish origin may make the salad with tuna. In Venezuela it is a traditional Christmas sidedish.

Her true identity is not publicly known. Never the Face Never the Face describes a sadomasochistic relationship between a man, David, and the book's narrator, a woman identified only as \\"Kitten\\" or \\"Bitch\\". In the novel, David trains Kitten to be the submissive partner in a sexual relationship that includes bondage, orgasm control and beating her with a variety of implements. What begins as a consensual relationship spirals into increasing physical and emotional abuse. The book contains explicit sexual imagery that has been described as \\"brutal\\". It was published in April 2011 by St Martin's Press. Identity To date the chief clues to Sands' identity are in an interview she gave to Claire Messud for Guernica magazine. According to Messud, who met Sands in person in Berlin in May 2011, \\"under another name, Ariel Sands is an internationally known and highly respected writer of nonfiction.\\" (She does not specify whether this other name is a real name or also a pseudonym.) Sands is \\"slight and elegant\\" but with \\"a commanding presence: in her professional capacity, she is accustomed to speaking before crowds.\\" Both her fiction and non-fiction writing, as well as her speech, are characterized by \\"acerbic wit\\", \\"erudition\\" and \\"concision\\".

She is \\"feminist by her own admission\\" and a \\"female success story\\" despite the \\"obsessive submissiveness\\" of her novel's protagonist. She is \\"on the cusp of forty\\". The interview does not mention her nationality. Her publisher's website describes her only as a \\"bestelling author\\". Reasons for pseudonymity In her interview with Messud, Sands says that she chose a pseudonym to avoid \\"genre confusion\\" with her non-fiction writing, and so that the text \\"would be taken on its own terms\\", rather than influenced by what readers already knew about the author.

A group of 15 Uyghur youths kidnapped two goat shepherds for directions. They were soon confronted by a group of five Pishan policemen, who tried to negotiate for the shepherds' release. The group attacked the policemen with knives, killing one and injuring another. The police shot back, killing seven hostage-takers, wounding and capturing four, freeing the two shepherds. The Xinjiang government called the kidnappers \\"violent terrorists\\", while an Uyghur exile group claimed the kidnappers' actions were the result of \\"police repression\\".  Background  Map including Koxtag () (DMA, 1984) Pishan County is one of the poorest counties in the Xinjiang region, on the southern edge of the Taklamakan Desert bordering Pakistan's Azad Kashmir. An oasis county, its people are predominantly cotton- growers. Han Chinese account for less than 2% of the population of Pishan. Residents of Pishan told Xinhua that a new spirit of extremism was damaging organized Uyghur life. Earlier in the month, religious extremists kidnapped and murdered an Uyghur man for drinking alcohol, which is prohibited in Islam. Store-owners in Pishan who sell alcoholic drinks and cigarettes said that they feared retaliation by extremists. The ethnic Uyghur-dominated southern part of Xinjiang has witnessed increasing separatist violence by Uyghurs who want to establish an independent state. On April 18 and 21, there were two fatal incidents of Uyghurs stabbing Han Chinese in the city of Kashgar. In July, Uyghur attackers seized a police station, threatened hostages, and battled police in a standoff that would ultimately end in 18 deaths. In that same month, a group of Pakistan-trained Uyghur youths killed 14 people in a vehicular, IED and knife attack in Kashgar.  Events  A Chinese state-run tabloid, The Global Times, cited a local official speaking on condition of anonymity as claiming that a party of 15 young men and their wives en route to Pakistani jihadist camps became lost near the mountainous areas of Pishan. Around 11 pm (1500 GMT) on December 28, they kidnapped two Uyghur goat shepherds in the town of Kuoshi Tage (Qoshtagh) and forced the shepherds to act as their guides. The kidnapping was witnessed by several workers at the Kuoshi Tage agricultural cooperative. At the border village of , the shepherds alerted local police to the group's intentions. Five police officers, led by Pishan deputy police chief Adil Abduveli, tried to persuade the party to abandon their plans, while negotiating for the shepherds' release. The party instead argued with the police, and when Abduveli touched one of the men's wives, a kidnapper stabbed Abdulveli to death and injured another police officer. According to local residents, the remaining police officers then opened fire, killing seven kidnappers and detaining four, who are charged with resisting arrest. The two hostages were freed, unharmed. The government did not announce the ethnicity of the kidnappers, except to say that they were ethnic minorities; Pishan residents interviewed by Radio Free Asia (RFA) confirmed that they were Uyghurs. The village chief of one of the hamlets unofficially claimed to identify two of the seven shot as Ablikim Abduqadir and Hebibulla Abduqadir. Hebibulla Abduqadir had taken a class taken three months prior in Artux which was considered an illegal religious activity.  Reactions  World Uyghur Congress spokesperson Dilxadi Rexiti (, also known as Dilxat Raxit) said on December 29 that the hostage-takers were \\"angry\\" that police had searched private homes for Islamic extremist material, explaining the police attack as a matter of \\"the local Uighur people [not being able to] take the pressure anymore.\\" Rexiti also questioned the death toll, claiming that his \\"sources\\" reported deaths of nine or ten among the kidnappers, not seven. On the other hand, Xinjiang government spokeswoman Hou Hanmin said that the kidnappers were \\"violent terrorists\\". No more details on the kidnappers have been released as the police are investigating the incident. On December 31, CPC party chief of Xinjiang Zhang Chunxian pledged to \\"safeguard regional stability\\" and to enlist the Xinjiang public in the fight against \\"foreign religious infiltration\\" and \\"organized terrorist attacks\\". According to China Daily, Microbloggers on Sina Weibo were generally supportive of the slain police officer; one suggested that the government should be less \\"negligent\\" about combating terrorism.

The dialogue was paralleled by joint military exercises of an unprecedented scale, titled Exercise Malabar. The diplomatic and military arrangement was widely viewed as a response to increased Chinese economic and military power, and the Chinese government responded to the Quad by issuing formal diplomatic protests to its members. The first iteration of the Quad ceased to exist following the withdrawal of Australia in February 2008, shortly after Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd took office, after a joint naval exercise between the Quad and Singapore drew diplomatic protests from China. Other reasons for the discontinuation of the Quad were that in late 2007, more Beijing-friendly Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda replaced Abe in Japan and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's state visit to China in January 2008, during which he stated that the India-China relationship was a priority. Under Rudd and his successor Julia Gillard, military cooperation between the United States and Australia was enhanced, leading to the placement of US Marines near Darwin, Australia, near the Timor Sea and Lombok Strait. India, Japan, and the United States continued to hold joint naval exercises through Malabar till 2019. In 2020 Australia joined the Malabar exercise after invite from India making it the first time all members of the Quad will be engaged militarily. However, during the 2017 ASEAN Summits all four former members rejoined in negotiations to revive the quadrilateral alliance.

The United States expected regional allies to help facilitate evolving US global strategy to fight against terrorism and nuclear proliferation.

In May 2007 in Manila, Australian Prime Minister John Howard participated with other members in the inaugural meeting of the Quadrilateral at Cheney's urging, one month after joint naval exercises near Tokyo by India, Japan and the United States. In September 2007 further naval exercises were held in the Bay of Bengal, including Australia. These were followed in October by a further security agreement between Japan and India, ratified during a visit by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Tokyo, to promote sea lane safety and defense collaboration; Japan had previously established such an agreement only with Australia. On the cusp of visits to China and meetings with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and President Hu Jintao in January 2008, the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, declared that \\"India is not part of any so-called contain China effort,\\" after being asked about the Quadrilateral.\\"PM says India not part of ‚Äúso called contain China‚Äù effort\\" The Hindu, 11 January 2008. In 2008 Kevin Rudd terminated the quadrilateral, signaling closer relations with China. In February 2008, following his nomination as Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd visited China's foreign minister Yang Jiechi and asked Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith to unilaterally announce Australia's departure from the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. Some US strategic thinkers criticized Rudd's decision to leave Quadrilateral; the former Asia director of the United States National Security Council, Mike Green, said that Rudd had withdrawn in an effort to please China, which had exerted substantial diplomatic effort to achieve that aim.Sheridan, Greg, \\"Asia fears Rudd's China fixation\\", The Australian, 3 May 2008.

In November 2017 Japanese, Indian, Australian and American officials met to continue security cooperation ahead of the ASEAN and East Asia Summits. The meeting included discussion of China's increased prominence in the South China Sea, and may have signaled U.S. president Trump's interest in reviving a formal Quadrilateral.

Barber and William B. Greene. It was formed to sell standardized material-handling machines to mechanize small manual tasks in an economical way. Though the company began by offering conveyors and bucket loaders, it is best known for its contributions to the asphalt field. In 1959, the company went public and was sold to Astec in 1985. History of the Asphalt Paver On November 15, 1930 in Aurora, Illinois Harry Barber made a sketch of a revolutionary new machine that was to become the Asphalt paver. Harry asked a patent attorney named W.R. Chambers to come from Chicago and see this new machine. The patent was filed on August 20, 1932 with a publication date on December 22, 1936. This eventually became the beginning of the development of the modern asphalt paver. Today, there is an entire industry that has been developed from this invention. The machine featured mixing and then placing asphalt in a single operation. This was exhibited for the first time at the 1931 Road Show in St. Louis. Barber realized that the mixing and placing operations needed to be separated and the mixing section became the line of Barber Greene asphalt plants and the placing section became the Barber Greene paver line. The early pavers used screw conveyors to distribute the mix in front of a screed that tamped the mix. This process meant that the asphalt was suitable for coarse-graded mixes, however on dense-graded mixes that were common on city streets the machine experienced problems including surface imperfections. In 1933, Barber's son Ashley (Ash) joined the company and in the same year the independent floating screed was developed. This screed along with the tamper bar that permitted uniform material density of the finished surface were the two key features that allowed the machine to become successful. Early pavers had a hopper which material was dumped into and spread by an auger. The floating screed was supported by runners that traveled on the prepared base material. On April 10, 1936 the U.S. Patent Office issued the initial patent number 2,138,828 \\"Machine for and process of laying roads\\" and on December 6, 1938 this patent was granted. By 1934, the production had started on the model 79 paver which featured a feeder conveyor to move the material to the auger. 2 years later in 1936, the 879 model was introduced. By 1940 this machine was upgraded to the 879-A Model and this machine was the standard asphalt paver around the world until the mid-1950s. These basic features that were introduced by Barber Greene have been incorporated into most asphalt pavers in use today (1987). Other Barber Greene firsts include: *First Synchronized tampers (1945) *First paver on rubber crawlers (1958) *First hydraulic paver (1959) *First automatic screed control (1960) *First hydrostatic paver (1970) Barber-Greene also made a successful line of trenching machines, asphalt batch plants, asphalt drum mixing plants, and road recyclers called Dynaplanes. Dissolution Barber-Greene shut down its manufacturing plant in Aurora, Illinois in 1985 and was later purchased by Astec Industries of Chattanooga, Tennessee in late 1986. The Barber-Greene headquarters in Aurora, Illinois was then sold to Transbulk Distribution Centers, Inc. for $2.9 million in 1987. The Barber-Greene Co of DeKalb (which manufactured paving equipment) was purchased by Caterpillar Inc. for approximately $25 million in 1991.

The revolutionary attempt lasted nearly a week, from 9 to 14 November, which is why it is known as the Red Week. It is also known as \\"Troelstra's mistake\\" (Vergissing van Troelstra), because it was led by the Dutch socialist Pieter Jelles Troelstra. Background The call for a socialist revolution in November 1918 was inspired by the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919. It was also a reaction to the social and economic conditions of the Netherlands at that time, especially the 1918 flu pandemic and the poverty, unemployment, food shortage and distress caused by World War I in which the Netherlands had remained neutral. Events Pieter Jelles Troelstra (about 1912) On 25 October 1918, soldiers in started a revolt. It was quickly extinguished, but made a deep impression on Troelstra. He saw the event as an opportunity to realize the socialist revolution. Troelstra expressed his opinion in a conference of the Dutch Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP), but the rest of the party leaders did not support his opinion, claiming that the time was not yet right. On 9 November, the German Emperor Wilhelm II abdicated. This, along with Troelstra's early declaration, caused a group of socialists from Rotterdam, led by , to feel that the revolution should begin as soon as possible. On 11 November they presented their demands to the mayor. Troelstra was very impressed by the demands, willing to go further. According to Willem Drees (later Dutch prime minister), Troelstra spoke about \\"taking over power\\" and \\"revolution\\", and claimed that the time had come for it. R. Bouwman. Troelstra en het succes van zijn mislukte revolutie. Socialisme en democratie, 38, nr. 7/8 (Amsterdam 1981): 23. The government quickly reacted. Armed police officers were stationed in Utrecht and in Amsterdam, and the royal family was secured. On 11 November, Catholic organizations met in The Hague and started a counter-campaign, included spreading of 500,000 pamphlets. Protestants and moderate socialists joined the counter-movement because they feared the extremism of a socialist revolution. Based on national and loyalist sentiments, the reaction was named \\"Orange Movement\\" (Oranjebeweging), after the Dutch royal family Orange-Nassau. On 12 November, prime minister Charles Ruijs de Beerenbrouck gave a speech, stating that the daily bread ration would be increased from to . Ruijs de Beerenbrouck called on the socialists to cooperate with the government and argued that violence would be disruptive. He threatened that if the citizens would not behave properly, the ration would not be increased. After that speech, Troelstra gave a long speech in parliament in which he incited a revolution and declared that the time had come for the workers to assume control of the government. Consequently, more troops were sent to the major cities (Rotterdam, Amsterdam and The Hague). On the night of 13 November, the counter-movement hung posters which stated that the revolutionaries were only a small minority. By that time, it was clear that the attempted revolution had failed.

The cinnamon challenge is a viral internet food challenge. The objective of the challenge is to film oneself eating a spoonful of ground cinnamon in under 60 seconds without drinking anything, then upload the video to the Internet. The challenge is difficult and carries substantial health risks because the cinnamon coats and dries the mouth and throat, resulting in coughing, gagging, vomiting, and inhalation of cinnamon, leading to throat irritation, breathing difficulties, and risk of pneumonia or a collapsed lung. The challenge has been described online since 2001, and increased in popularity in 2007, peaking abruptly in January 2012 and falling off almost as sharply through the first half of that year, then tapering off almost to its previous level by 2014.Google Insights for Search - Web Search Interest: \\"cinnamon challenge\\" - Worldwide, 204 - present, Google Insights for Search, accessed July 26, 2016 By 2010, many people had posted videos of themselves attempting this challenge on YouTube and other social networking websites. The cinnamon challenge peaked in activity in January 2012, with Twitter mentions peaking at nearly 70,000 per day It is similar to the saltine cracker challenge, which involves ingesting at least six saltine crackers - also known as soda crackers - within 60 seconds without drinking anything, the Gallon challenge, and the Banana Sprite challenge. Health dangers The stunt can be dangerous, as there is a risk of gagging or choking on the cinnamon, especially if it forms a clump and clogs one's airways. Accidental inhalation of cinnamon can seriously damage the lungs by causing inflammation and leading to infection. The usual result of this stunt is \\"a coughing, gagging fit involving clouds of cinnamon\\" which \\"leaves some people gasping for air\\". Sometimes those performing the stunt may gag, choke or cough and accidentally exhale the cinnamon through their noses, coating their skin and mucous membranes in cinnamon. As cinnamon is rich in the compound cinnamaldehyde that can irritate skin and tissues, the challenge often results in considerable irritation, discomfort, burning, or itching of the affected nasal tissue and nostrils. Preclinical studies in rats have shown that the cellulose fibers which comprise cinnamon are also responsible for triggering allergic hypersensitivity reactions. On YouTube, people have been seen \\"coughing, choking and lunging for water, usually as friends watch and laugh.\\" Vomiting is also known to have occurred. Cinnamon contains the chemical coumarin which is moderately toxic to your liver and kidney if ingested in large amounts. The cinnamon challenge can be life-threatening or fatal. In the first three months of 2012, American poison control centers received over a hundred phone calls as a result of the cinnamon challenge. A high-school student in Michigan spent four days in a hospital after attempting the cinnamon challenge. Pneumonia, inflammation and scarring of the lungs, and collapsed lungs are further risks. In popular culture The cinnamon challenge was aired on the twelfth series of the reality television show Big Brother UK, in which show participants were to ingest ground cinnamon without the aid of water. Radio programs have also aired segments of people performing this stunt, and others in the public limelight have been reported as airing the stunt for public display, including NBA players Nick Young and JaVale McGee. An excerpt from a cinnamon challenge video Many people upload their cinnamon challenge to YouTube. Comedian Colleen Ballinger told The Wall Street Journal that she took the challenge in character as Miranda Sings, in 2012, to increase her YouTube traffic after hundreds of her fans had asked her to take the challenge. Her video received more than 2 million views, even though it is on a discontinued YouTube channel.Keates, Nancy. \\"Just a Spoonful of Cinnamon Makes the Internet Rounds\\", The Wall Street Journal, March 14, 2012Ballinger, Colleen.

It is known locally as Chippy Lane due to the density of fast food shops along the street. History Located within the original town walls of Cardiff, and just south of the original Cardiff Gaol, much as though its modern form caters for the eating needs of the public, a number of buildings in Caroline Street have listed building status. Caroline Street was renamed in the Victorian era after Caroline of Brunswick, the wife of King George IV. The next street south is Charlotte Street, named after their daughter Princess Charlotte of Wales. In 1857, the same year that the last public execution took place in Cardiff, records show that 150 died as a result of an outbreak of smallpox on Caroline Street. Chippy Alley Dorothy's Cafe & Fish Bar on Caroline Street, established 1953 Up until the post-World War II period, the street was a traditional mixed-trading street, with occupants including butchers and cobblers. Fast food shops in Caroline Street Since that time, the number of family and privately owned fast food outlets has steadily increased, and as of 2011 only a single outlet for Greggs bakery is resident on the Hayes end of the street, keeping Caroline Street relatively free of national and international chains and franchises. Dorothy's claims to be the oldest resident fast food shop on Caroline Street, which is a fish and chip shop. The favourite fare served by all shops includes the preferred South Wales delicacy of curry sauce and chips. Colloquially locals call the street Chippy Alley. Reputation Such is the reputation of Caroline Street amongst local residents and numerous university students, that it is normally a riotous but well behaved location, with premises staying open until past 2:00 am on Friday and Saturday nights. In 2010 the licensing officer for South Wales Police described Caroline Street as \\"a honey pot for anti-social behaviour. There are a lot of late night incidents in the area... During the peak period between 11pm-4am this area is a hotspot for crime.\\" Prominent incidents occasionally occur, such as in January 2011 when the then Cardiff City F.C. footballer Craig Bellamy was arrested and bailed on an alleged assault claim, in which two men suffered facial injuries. The street's reputation is referenced in an episode of the sitcom Gavin & Stacey. 2003 refurbishment Entrance to the Brewery Quarter on Caroline Street In 2003, after the development of the mixed-use Old Brewery Quarter from Brains Brewery former premises, and the proposed redevelopment of both the St David's Centre and The Hayes, it was decided to refurbish Caroline Street. Pedestrianised, the street floor structure was given a stone based easy-clean finish, although late at night this has still not resolved the problem of pedestrians slipping even when sober, due to the sheer volume of food packaging and food waste which the street accumulates. It has however made it far easier to clean and keep clean.

Murray-Anderdon became honorary secretary of Somerset after the club had fallen out of first-class cricket in 1885; in five years, he had established it on a sounder financial footing, recruited illustrious players such as Sammy Woods, overseen the leasing of (and later the acquisition of) the current County Ground at Taunton, and, in 1891, seen the team restored to first-class status in the newly organised County Championship. He remained as honorary secretary until 1910 and then became Life President from 1915 until his death. Murray-Anderdon was the son of the rector of Chislehurst, Kent, the Rev Francis Murray, and his wife Fanny Catherine Anderdon. He was educated at Marlborough College where he did not make the cricket team. He inherited a large house at Henlade, near Taunton, from an uncle in 1873 and, changing his surname to Murray-Anderdon, thereafter lived the life of a country gentleman and man of activities. \\"He had a commanding, aristocratic manner,\\" says one history of Somerset cricket. From 1882 to 1885, Somerset played sufficient fixtures against other county sides for its matches to be regarded as first- class, but in the last of these seasons it was beset by a poor playing record and amateurish organisation: only nine players turned out in the match against Hampshire, and first-class status was withdrawn after 1885. Murray-Anderdon became secretary of the club at this point: he proved to be \\"a fine administrator and his job was to shake the place up\\". Somerset took a 19-year lease on the County Ground at Taunton and bought it outright in 1896, and Murray-Anderdon instituted the policy, pursued well into the second half of the 20th century, of trawling the universities and further afield for potential playing recruits who, as amateurs, would not normally need payment; among his early successes was the Australian, Sammy Woods. In 1890, as a second-class county, Somerset won 12 out of 13 fixtures with the bigger teams and were re-admitted to first-class status in 1891, including, by that time, a properly constituted County Championship. Murray-Anderdon remained as unpaid honorary secretary into the early years of the 20th century, working for most of that period alongside Woods, who was described as \\"captain and secretary\\", a frequent fiction in amateur times that enabled Woods to be paid (for the secretarial duties) while retaining amateur status as a player; Murray- Anderdon was also a member of various MCC committees. Although \\"cricket, along with fishing, was his passion\\", Murray-Anderdon also involved himself in other worthy activities. He was president of the Somerset Football Association. In 1896, he was elected as one of two representatives for the Diocese of Bath and Wells on a trust fund for distressed clergy.

At the time of his death he was the only surviving son of Harvey Fisk, who founded the banking house of Fisk & Hatch in 1862 and helped the Union finance the Civil War. He was associated with his brother Pliny Fisk, who was an outstanding investment banker before the first World War, in the management of their father's firm. Biography Fisk was born in Jersey City in 1856. His mother was the former Louisa Green of Trenton. He graduated from Princeton University in 1877 and immediately joined the firm of Fisk & Hatch. In 1885 the firm was reorganized and became Harvey Fisk & Sons. Mr. Fisk specialized in railroad securities. He resigned from the family company in 1898 and a year later formed a partnership with George H. Robinson for investment banking purposes. Harvey E. Fisk retired from the firm of Fisk & Robinson, on January 13, 1915. This caused the partnership to expire by limitation. The business continued at the same location, 26 Exchange Place, under the name of Robinson & Co. with members being George H. Robinson, Thomas G. Cook, and J. Stanley Brown. Fisk announced that he would be located hereafter at the office of Harvey Fisk & Sons. Three years later Mr. Fisk joined the Bankers Trust Company as a research writer. Fisk specialized in the preparation of pamphlets and books on public finance, and, in one book, calculated that the total direct expenditure for World War I amounted to $223,000,000,000. He remained with the Bankers Trust until his retirement in 1930. Harvey E. Fisk residence at 12 East 53rd Street in New York City. In 1909, Harvey E. Fisk is reported to have sold his house at 12 East 53rd Street in Manhattan. The house was built for Mr. Fisk by Charles T. Wills from plans by Raleigh C. Gildersleeve. Previously there was an old brownstone on the lot which was owned by Walter G. Oakman. This was torn down except for the side walls, and a new dwelling put into its place. The unusual depth of the lot of 119.5 feet, allowed Fisk to carry out a plan of having three extra deep rooms. The main floor had a large reception room in front, a large music room in the middle, and an imposing dining room at the rear. This house which is still extant is a five-story American basement house, with a frontage of 37.6 feet. The house was sold to William L. Harkness, Standard Oil heir, for $400,000. All of the furnishing were including the rugs and tapestries that had been bought abroad, were included in the purchase. Harkness was a cousin of noted philanthropist Edward Harkness. Harvey Edward Fisk was engaged in extensive philanthropic work. In his younger days he sponsored a boys' club on the West Side in New York. He also helped raise funds for Mercer Hospital in Trenton, New Jersey, where he died. Up to his death he was actively involved in the work of the Princeton University Library and was an honorary curator there of the Benjamin Strong collection of books on industry and finance. Family Harvey Edward Fisk married Mary Lee Scudder in 1879. Mrs. Fisk for many years engaged in social service work with the Riverside Association. During World War I she devoted her time to aiding the United States Navy, and later provided clothing for wounded men returning from France. She was former chairman of the executive committee of the Sorosis Club, a life member of the New Jersey Society of the Colonial Dames of America and a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. At the time of her death, Mrs. Fisk was living in her apartment at the Madison Square Hotel, 37 Madison Avenue. In addition to his brother Pliny, Harvey E. Fisk's other brothers were Charles J. Fisk, banker and former Mayor of Plainfield, New Jersey; Wilbur C. Fisk, former president of the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad Company; and Alexander G. Fisk, also a banker. Harvey Edward Fisk married Mary Lee Scudder of Trenton, New Jersey, in 1879. They remained married until her death in 1941. Fisk had two sons: Harvey E. Fisk Jr., of Fairfield, Connecticut, and Kenneth Fisk of Roseland, New Jersey, and three sisters, Miss Mary Louis Fisk, Mrs. Samuel Wood Thurber of Princeton, and Mrs. John Warren DuBois Gould of 102 East Twenty-second Street, New York City.

It was shot in Greenwich area in London starring Christopher Kelham as Dale. The film shows diverse characters and the price they pay for falling in love. The Cost of Love was an Official Selection for End of Pier International Film Festival in 2010 and the festival's closing number. It was screened in 2010 at the East End Film Festival where it was nominated for \\"Best UK Debut Feature\\". Plot Told mostly in first person, it is the story of Dale (Christopher Kelham), in which reality and fantasy intermingle so that the viewer is left to wonder at all times if a scene (or all scenes) are actual or Dale's imagination. Dale is a hustler who from the onset of the film says he likes sex, lots of it and in all of its varied forms, including S&M.; He spends his days cruising parks and saunas for casual sex or prostituting to high-paying clients making their sexual fantasies come true. Upfront with his sexuality and his hustling ways to everybody, Dale's hard exterior is a mask to hide his very fragile shattered interior. He has developed a rampant imagination and fantasies of his own that he resorts to in many situations he is in. Dale has longed for his best friend since childhood, the \\"straight\\" Raj (Valmike Rampersad) and has developed very romantic feelings towards him. Dale is shocked when Raj asks him to become his best man at a hastily arranged wedding with Veena (Mandeesh Gill),Entertainment Focus: Review of Cost of Love a children's teacher. But there is more to it, since it turns out she is terminally ill and has only a few months to live. Besides Raj, the other main character is Sean (Michael Joyce, also known in gay scene as the drag artist Estee Applauder) who is Dale's confidant and has an obvious crush on him. Sean has to deal with Christine (Caroline Burns Cooke). There is also Ricardo (Israel Cassol) who is a Brazilian hunk escort, friend of Dale, and a partner in many of his hustling acts. Pete (Robert Gray) is another character who has to come to terms with his sexuality through his involvement with Dale in a series of role-playing abusive relationship. Secrets are revealed when a stranger, Richard (Frank Jakeman), starts frequenting a bar where Sean is performing and makes approaches to reveal deep family secrets. Homophobia is there with the murder of a young gay man on the Heath, a notable night-time cruising ground in London. Viewers are kept guessing whether this is actually Ricardo or some unknown character as Dale and Sean visit the site to put some flowers. This is also the prelude for a (real or imagined) fantasy scene where Dale is being murdered during an S&M; act while he is fantasizing every detail of the gruesome torture and murder. And in a dreamlike \\"funeral scene\\", all the grieving characters are present in the church to \\"mourn\\" Dale's loss, while Dale is commenting on their lives after his departure, while they are reminiscing on the impact Dale had on all their lives.

The daily Gasoline Alley strips of February 14‚Äì15, 1921, are added on The Sunday Funnies' editorial page to show the arrival of Skeezix as a newborn baby on the doorstep of Walt Wallet. Also featured in the third section is an essay by Cochran, \\"The Vanishing Newspaper\\", decrying libraries' destruction of newspapers once they had been microfilmed and praising Blackbeard's role in comics preservation. Comic strips announced as forthcoming are Frank King's Bobby Make-Believe, Buck Rogers, Frank Godwin's Connie, Flash Gordon, Billy Ireland's The Passing Show, Polly and Her Pals, Winsor McCay's A Tale of the Jungle Imps by Felix Fiddle and Terry and the Pirates. Reaction Captain Comics reviewed the debut issue of The Sunday Funnies: :Gasoline Alley: The current Walt and Skeezix series (volume five of which shipped recently and covers 1929-1930) reprints dailies only. There was a single volume of color Sundays released a couple of years ago, but it is not comprehensive. Frank King is known equally for his innovative Sunday layout and design as he is for his ongoing narrative in which the characters age in real time. The earliest strips are printed in duotone red and white, but full color was added after a while. This is easily my favorite feature. Alley Oop: There isn‚Äôt a comprehensive collection of Alley Oop dailies or Sundays. My second favorite feature... Stumble Inn: A thematic precursor to Berke Breathed‚Äôs Bloom County (the early days, anyway). Herriman must have been an influence on Breathed, because certain aspects of later Bloom Country, and especially its follow-up, Outland, greatly resembled Krazy Kat... These strips are reprinted in the original size, a Sunday broadsheet. The paper stock is thick, non-glossy and brilliantly white, beautifully showcasing the original colors (as well as the slight yellowing of the source paper)... Editor Russ Cochran also provides his e-mail address for feedback regarding future features.Captain Comics, January 13, 2012.

According to the Small Arms Survey, it arose from the 1991 schism within the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) for the dual purpose of defending Nuer cattle herds from neighbouring groups and fighting in the Second Sudanese Civil War between the SPLM/A and the Sudanese government. While sometimes reported that the White Army was so named due to the Nuer practice of smearing one's skin with a light-coloured ash as a protection against biting insects, other sources contend the name was merely intended to draw a distinction between the Nuer militia and the Sudan Armed Forces, with the irregular \\"white\\" forces opposing the regular \\"black\\" forces, so called because white has a positive connotation and black a negative one. History of activity =1990s= During the Second Sudanese Civil War, White Army fighters mainly from the Lou Nuer subtribe backed the breakaway SPLM/A faction led by Riek Machar, known as SPLA-Nasir, in attacks on the Dinka majority. They were partly responsible for the Bor massacre, in which at least 2000 people were killed in 1991. However, the fighters never formed long-term alliances with other factions in the war, acting for short-term benefit only. Among their most regular enemies were the Murle people, a rival tribe competing for land and cattle in the states of Jonglei and Upper Nile. During the war, though the term \\"White Army\\" could refer collectively to Nuer youth militants, there was rarely any functioning central authority for the disparate fighters, and a number of White Army factions based around different cattle camps operated autonomously or semi-autonomously of one another. The ranks of leadership had a reportedly high rate of turnover. =2000s= After the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005 between the government of Sudan and the SPLM/A, which formed the Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan, the Nuer White Army lost its remaining coherence. By February 2006, Nuer elders interviewed by Small Arms Survey workers acknowledged they had little or no control over the armed youths and said the incidence of cattle theft and other miscreant behaviour on the youths' part was increasing. Riek Machar, the White Army's erstwhile wartime ally, announced the White Army would be disbanded amidst a SPLM/A disarmament campaign in the region. However, it was not until a major defeat in May 2006 near Motot, in Jonglei's Uror County, in which 113 White Army fighters were reportedly killed for the loss of a single Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) soldier, that the fighters gave up their attempts at resistance, according to the Small Arms Survey. The news service IRIN reported that more than 1,000 Lou Nuer men and boys in Akobo County who had been part of the White Army voluntarily surrendered their weapons to authorities in July 2006. =2010s= In late December 2011, several months after South Sudan gained its independence, The Upper Nile Times reported that the Nuer White Army had reformed and had issued a threat on Christmas Day 2011 to \\"wipe out the entire Murle Tribe on the face of the earth as the only solution to guarantee long-term security of Nuer's cattle\\". The statement also declared the White Army's intention to fight the SPLA and the United Nations, which has a peacekeeping mission in the country. The declaration marked an escalation in the ongoing clashes between the SPLA, the Murle, and the Lou Nuer in Jonglei and Upper Nile, which began when armed Murle fighters under the influence of George Athor's South Sudan Democratic Movement launched a cattle raid against the Lou Nuer in Jonglei state. UNMISS responded by deploying peacekeepers to Pibor town and urging both the Murle and Lou Nuer to lay down their arms.

The province consists of more than 50 seamounts, up to in height, within a area. Unlike most seamount groups, the Christmas Island seamount formation does not form a long hotspot-based chain of increasingly older volcanoes, instead being a scattered grouping of volcanoes within a large radius. The origins of the formation have long been enigmatic for scientists; the Christmas Island area does not exhibit the hotspot chain formation that most seamount groups have, nor does it run perpendicular to a local rift zone, instead lying roughly parallel to the edge of the Australian Plate. Many of the seamounts are flat-topped guyots, showing that at one point the province was likely a group of active volcanic islands, before it was slowly eroded to its current subsurface level. A 2011 study acquired and tested rock samples for 40Ar/39Ar, strontium, neodymium, hafnium and lead to determine its age and origin. The study found that the rock of the seamounts was more similar to continental than oceanic crust, particularly resembling northwest Australian crust. The seamounts were found to be 47 to 136 million years old, decreasing in age from east to west, and at most 25 million years younger than the crust surrounding them. Plate reconstructions based on these dates showed that the seamounts formed where West Burma separated from Australia and India, during the breakup of Gondwana, approximately 150 million years ago. The paper proposed that the seamounts are made of recycled, delaminated continental crust enriched in mantle material that was rising beneath the mid-ocean ridge forming at the time, and that this may be a relatively common process in shallow-basin areas.

He attended the Royal Academy Schools, but was not formally enrolled. He is best known for his topographical views painted during his visits to the Rhine Valley, the Moselle, Switzerland, and the Italian lakes. Stanfield exhibited, starting at age sixteen, at the Royal Academy from 1844 to 1876 (a total of 49 works) and at the British Institution from 1844 to 1867 (a total of 73 works). He had a limited success during his lifetime, probably due to a shift in taste of the public. Stanfield married his cousin, Maria Blackburn, in 1854 and took up residence in Hampstead. They had five sons and two daughters. He died of liver disease at the home of his sister in Hampstead, north London, on 22 March 1878.

The Loyalists successfully defended a blockhouse against an ineffective bombardment by four American artillery pieces and a failed attempt to storm the position by Wayne's infantry. During the action, American light dragoons under Major Light Horse Harry Lee drove off a large number of cattle that were kept in the area for the use of the British army in New York City. The clash inspired British Major John Andr√© to write a satirical ballad entitled The Cow Chace. The skirmish was fought at Bulls Ferry, New Jersey in the Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga. At this stage of the conflict only raids and minor actions occurred in the north. Background The Battle of Monmouth on 28 June 1778 was the last significant engagement in the north.Boatner, 725 After the battle, George Washington marched his army to New Brunswick, New Jersey, arriving there on 2 . Leaving William Maxwell's brigade in New Jersey, the main body of the American army crossed the Hudson River. By 24 July Washington's army arrived at White Plains, New York and placed the British garrison of New York City in a blockade that lasted the remainder of the war. In late July, the French admiral Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing arrived off Sandy Hook with one 90-gun ship of the line, one 80, six 74s, two 64s, and one 50, plus four frigates. Badly outgunned, Sir Richard Howe prepared to defend the entrance to New York harbor with six 64s, three 50s, six frigates, four galleys, and an armed merchantman. Meanwhile, British commander Sir Henry Clinton at Sandy Hook needed Howe's ships to transport his army to New York, otherwise he might be trapped. D'Estaing, whose larger vessels drew was informed by local pilots that there was only of water over the bar. On the morning of 22 July the frustrated French admiral sailed away. That afternoon a high tide pushed 30 feet of water over the bar and thus an opportunity to end the war in 1778 was missed.Morrissey, 77-78 On 27 September 1778, the British wiped out the 3rd Continental Light Dragoons in the Baylor Massacre.Boatner, 1085-1086 On the American side, Anthony Wayne carried out a brilliant coup in the Battle of Stony Point on 16 July 1779.Boatner, 1062-1067 This feat was followed on 19 August 1779 by another successful raid by Light Horse Harry Lee in the Battle of Paulus Hook.Boatner, 836-841 With a total of 27,000 troops on the Atlantic coast of North America, Clinton decided to move against Charleston, South Carolina. Leaving Wilhelm von Knyphausen to hold New York with 10,000 soldiers, Clinton embarked for the south with 8,700 troops in the fleet of Mariot Arbuthnot on 26 December 1779.Boatner, 207-208 Clinton was later reinforced so that his army numbered 12,500. The subsequent capitulation of Benjamin Lincoln's army in the Siege of Charleston on 12 May 1780 represented the largest American mass surrender of the war. As many as 5,500 men were captured, including 2,650 irreplaceable Continental Army soldiers. Leaving Lord Charles Cornwallis in South Carolina with two-thirds of the army, Clinton headed back to New York.Boatner, 212-214 Meanwhile, Knyphausen staged the Springfield Raid in June 1780. The Hessian general started out with 5,000 men on 7 June. That day, he was successfully blocked by Elias Dayton's Continentals and militia in the Battle of Connecticut Farms. Clinton returned to New York on 17 June. Hearing that a French fleet and army was on the way to Newport, Rhode Island, the British commander sent some ships up the Hudson to make it difficult for the Americans to cross to the east side and join the French. Washington moved his army to cover his key fort at West Point, New York on the Hudson, leaving Nathanael Greene to shield his base at Morristown, New Jersey. On 23 June, Knyphausen lunged at Morristown. In the Battle of Springfield, Greene's division slowed the Hessian general's thrust. That evening Knyphausen withdrew into Staten Island.Boatner, 1045-1048 Battle On 20 July 1780, Washington ordered Wayne to take the 1st and 2nd Pennsylvania Brigades, four artillery pieces, and Stephen Moylan's 4th Continental Light Dragoons to destroy a British blockhouse at Bulls Ferry in Bergen Township, opposite New York City. The stockaded position was held by 70 Loyalists commanded by Thomas Ward, providing a base for British woodcutting operations and protection against raids by American militia.Boatner, 119‚Äì120 At that time, the British kept cattle and horses on Bergen Neck to the south, within easy reach of foragers from the British garrison at Paulus Hook. A second motive for Wayne's operation was to seize the livestock for the use of Washington's army. Wayne sent his cavalry under the leadership of Harry Lee to round up the cattle, while he took three regiments and the artillery to attack the blockhouse.americanrevolution.org, The Cow Chace 1780 Early on 21 July, Wayne bombarded the blockhouse with his four cannons, but an hour later there were no discernible results. After being peppered with accurate fire from the blockhouse, the American soldiers from the 1st and 2nd Pennsylvania Regiments became impatient. Despite their officers' attempts to stop them, the soldiers dashed forward through the abatis to the base of the stockade. Once there, they found it impossible to break into the defensive works, and were forced to retreat.Boatner, 120 Result Aside from John Andr√©'s ballad, the consequences of the skirmish were the loss of lives and the seizure of cattle. Wayne reported losses of 15 enlisted men killed, plus three officers and 46 enlisted men wounded. Clinton estimated that Wayne had almost 2,000 troops available. He admitted the loss of 21 casualties and reported that 50 round shot penetrated the blockhouse. In a poetical note at the end of The Cow Chace, Andr√© suggested that five Loyalists were killed. > Five refugees ('tis true) were found, > Stiff on the blockhouse floor; > But then 'tis thought the shot went round, > And in at the back door. British Major John Andr√© penned a satirical verse The Cow Chace about the battle. In one stanza, the British major poked fun at American claims that their cannonballs could not damage the blockhouse. > No shot could pass, if you will take > The General's word for true; > But 'tis a d(amna)ble mistake, > For every shot went through. Lee rounded up a substantial number of cattle and returned them to Washington's camp. Wayne burned the wood-cutters' boats and captured some of the boatmen. From Andr√©'s fifth stanza, it is clear that Colonel Thomas Proctor commanded Wayne's artillery. Proctor was born in Ireland (\\"remoter Shannon\\").Nead, Gen. Thomas Proctor > And sons of distant Delaware, > And still remoter Shannon, > And Major Lee with horses rare, > And Procter with his cannon. Andr√© mocked Wayne's subordinate Brigadier General William Irvine, who fought at Bull's Ferry.Boatner, 546 The British major credited Irvine, misspelled \\"Irving\\", with command of the attack on the blockhouse while Wayne and Lee had the easy work of cattle rustling. William Irvine was viciously lampooned by Andr√©. > At Irving's nod 'twas fine to see, > The left prepare to fight; > The while, the drovers, Wayne and Lee, > Drew off upon the right. Two later stanzas made fun of the retreat of Irvine's column. > Irving and terror in the van, > Came flying all abroad; > And cannon, colors, horse, and man, > Ran tumbling to the road. > > Still as he fled, 'twas Irving's cry, > And his example too, > \\"Run on, my merry men ‚Äì For why? > The shot will not go through.\\" Light Horse Harry Lee's dragoons rounded up cattle. The British major even took a swipe at William Alexander, Lord Stirling who was not even involved in the operation. Alexander had made an unsuccessful attempt to claim a Scottish earldom between 1756 and 1762.Boatner, 16 His hard-drinking ways were well- known to British officers.Preston, 266‚Äì267 > Let none candidly infer, > That Stirling wanted spunk; > The self-made peer had sure been there, > But that the peer was drunk. Alluding to his pre-war career as a tanner,Boatner, 1175 Andr√© poked fun at Wayne in the first and last stanzas. > To drive the kine one summer's morn, > The tanner took his way; > The calf shall rue that is unborn, > The jumbling of that day. > > And now I've clos'd my epic strain, > I tremble as I show it, > Lest this same warrior-drover, Wayne, > Should ever catch the poet.

Legal consultant and writer The junior Owen Ruffhead was born in Piccadilly. When still a child his father bought him a lottery ticket, and, drawing a prize of ¬£500, invested the money in his son's education. He entered the Middle Temple in 1742, was called to the bar in 1747, and he gradually obtained a good practice, less as a regular pleader than as a consultant and framer of bills for parliament. In the meantime he sought to form some political connections, and, with this end in view, he in 1757 started the Con- Test in support of the government against the gibes of a weekly paper called the Test, which was run by Arthur Murphy in the interests of Henry Fox (afterwards first Baron Holland) Both abounded in personalities, and the hope expressed by Samuel Johnson in the Literary Magazine, that neither would be long-lived, was happily fulfilled (see A Morning's Thoughts on Reading the Test and the Con-Test, 1757, octavo). From about 1760 he commenced editing, at the cost of great labour, The Statutes at Large from Magna Charta to 1763, which was issued in nine folio volumes, London, 1762‚Äì1765, and again in 1769. Ruffhead's collection maintained a position of authority, and was continued successively by Charles Runnington, Sir Thomas Edlyne Tomlins, John Raithby, Simons, and Sir George Kettilby Rickards. In 1760 Ruffhead addressed to William Pitt a letter of some eloquence upon the Reasons why the approaching Treaty of Peace should be debated in Parliament, and this was followed by pamphlets, including Considerations on the Present Dangerous Crisis (1763, quarto), and The Case of the late Election for the County of Middlesex considered (1764, quarto), in which he defended the conduct of the administration in relation to John Wilkes. Literary critic In about 1767, Bishop William Warburton asked Ruffhead to undertake the task of digesting into a volume his materials for a critical biography of Alexander Pope. Warburton reserved to himself the reading of the proof-sheets and the supervision of the plan. Ruffhead set to work with the methodical industry that was habitual to him, and the result appeared in 1769 (preface dated Middle Temple, 2 January) as The Life of Alexander Pope, from Original Manuscripts, with a Critical Essay on his Writings and Genius in an appendix were printed letters from Pope to Aaron Hill. Though tame and lifeless, the book was read with avidity as affording for the first time a quantity of authentic information about the best-known name of a literary epoch; four editions appeared within the year (one at Dublin), and the work was translated into French (it was also prefixed to Pope's Works, Paris, 1799). The verdict of a reviewer (possibly Johnson) in the Gentleman's Magazine, that \\"Mr. Ruffhead says of fine passages that they are fine, and of feeble passages that they are feeble; but recommending poetical beauty is like remarking the splendour of sunshine‚Äîto those who can see it is unnecessary; to those who are blind, absurd\\", was subsequently abridged by Johnson into \\"Ruffhead knew nothing of Pope and nothing of poetry\\". Elwin dismisses him as \\"an uncritical transcriber\\". Ruffhead was himself a reviewer for the Gentleman's Magazine, and he had in hand simultaneously with his Life of Pope, an edition of Giles Jacob's New Law Dictionary (published after his death in 1772), and the superintendence of a new edition of Ephraim Chambers' Cyclop√¶dia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences. Death and issue His close application to his later literary works, in addition to his legal duties, undermined his health, and a cold taken in a heated court resulted in his premature death on 25 October 1769. A few days before his death, in recognition of his political services, he had received an offer of a secretaryship in the treasury. He left one son, Thomas, who died a curate of Prittlewell in Essex in 1798. The publishers recovered from him a sum advanced to his father on account of Chambers' Cyclop√¶dia the supervision of which was transferred in 1773 to John Calder.

Born in Bedfordshire, England, she was the daughter of Lewis Latham, a falconer for King Charles I. She was first married to William Dungan, with whom she had four children. Dungan died at an early age, and she soon married Jeremy Clarke who brought her and her Dungan children to New England where they settled in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Clarke was a prominent merchant who became the President of the colony for a year. With Clarke, Frances had seven children, the oldest of whom, Walter, later became a governor of the colony. Jeremy Clarke died when all of his children were still minors, after which Frances married her third husband, the Reverend William Vaughan of Newport. Frances and her last husband both died at about the same time in 1677 in Newport, and Frances was buried in the Common Burying Ground there. She leaves a legacy of thousands of descendants, many of whom reached great prominence during their lives.  Life  Baptized in Kempston, Bedfordshire, England on 15 February 1609/10, Frances Latham was the daughter of Lewis Latham and his wife Elizabeth. Her father, born about 1584 in Elstow, Bedfordshire, was a Sergeant Falconer under King Charles I. Lewis Latham, father of Frances Frances' first husband was William Dungan, who was a perfumer living in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, now a part of London. With Dungan she had four children, but he died in 1636, being buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 20 September of that year, leaving a will with Frances as executrix, and naming each of his four minor children. Within two years she was remarried, this time to Jeremy Clarke of London, a nephew of Richard Weston, 1st Earl of Portland. Soon thereafter the couple immigrated to New England with Frances' four young children, and in 1638 Jeremy was admitted as an inhabitant of Aquidneck Island (Portsmouth) in what soon became the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Following turmoil in the government of the island in 1639, her husband was one of the nine signatories of an agreement to form the settlement of Newport at the south end of the island. He held a number of important positions in the town and colonial government, and in 1648 became President of the entire colony, serving for a year in this role. Clarke died in January 1652, with his death being recorded later in the Friends' (Quaker) records. He was buried in the \\"tomb that stands by the street by the water side in Newport,\\" now lost, but his governor's grave medallion is in the Clifton Burying Ground where several Quaker Rhode Island colonial governors were later buried. About a year after her second husband's death, her father, Lewis Latham, also died, leaving Frances a small legacy in his will. Frances was again a widow with many young children, and within a few years she had married her third husband, the Reverend William Vaughan of Newport. The time of her marriage to Vaughan was before January 1656 when she made an agreement with her oldest Clarke son, Walter, through his guardians, John Cranston and James Barker, settling inheritance issues, now that she was no longer widowed. Vaughan had been ordained in 1648 as a member of the First Baptist Church of Newport, but in 1656 he and others formed the Second Baptist Church. He was a highly respected citizen of Newport, so much so that in April 1676, during King Philip's War, he was one of 16 colonial leaders whose counsel was requested by the General Assembly during \\"these troublesome times and straits.\\" Others named in this request for counsel were former governor Benedict Arnold, former President Gregory Dexter, and future deputy governor James Barker. Frances died in 1677, at about the same time that her husband died. In September of that year Samuel Hubbard of Newport wrote to his children in Westerly, \\"For news, Mr. Vahan is gone to his long home and his wife is like to follow him if not dead.\\" Frances was buried in the Common Burying Ground in Newport, and on her stone was placed the following inscription, \\"Here Lyeth ye Body of Mrs. Frances Vaughan, Alius Clarke, ye mother of ye only children of Capt'n Jeremiah Clarke. She died ye 1 week in Sept., 1677, in ye 67th year of her age.\\"  Family and legacy  Late 19th century genealogist John Osborne Austin proposed that Frances had first been married to a \\"Lord Weston\\" as a teenager, but strong evidence against this was presented by New Haven genealogist Louise Tracy in 1908. Frances had 11 children by her first and second husbands, and leaves behind numerous descendants, many of them prominent. Her oldest daughter, Barbara Dungan, married James Barker, who served as deputy governor of the colony. Her second daughter, Frances Dungan, married Randall Holden, a signer of the Portsmouth Compact, and one of the founding settlers of the town of Warwick. Descendants through this daughter include William Greene, an early governor of Rhode Island shortly after the Revolutionary War, his son, Honorable Ray Greene, and his grandson William Greene, a lieutenant governor of the state. Her oldest Clarke child, Walter, served for more than 20 years as deputy governor of the colony, and also served several years as the governor. Her daughter, Mary Clarke, married John Cranston, another governor of the colony, and they were parents of the longest-serving Rhode Island governor, Samuel Cranston. Frances' son Weston Clarke married Mary Easton who was a granddaughter of two other governors, John Coggeshall and Nicholas Easton Her son, Latham Clarke, married Hannah Wilbur, the daughter of Samuel Wilbur, Jr. who was one of seven purchasers of the Pettaquamscutt lands, and who was also mentioned in Rhode Island's Royal Charter of 1663. Her youngest child, Sarah Clarke, married colonial governor Caleb Carr as her second husband. Other Rhode Island governors who are direct descendants of Frances include Nehemiah R. Knight, Henry Lippitt, Charles C. Van Zandt, Charles W. Lippitt, John Chafee, and Lincoln Chafee, as well as a governor of the state of Washington, John R. Rogers. Additional deputy or lieutenant governors that descend from her are Rhode Island's John Gardner and Samuel G. Arnold, while another Rhode Island governor related to her by marriage is William Wanton. Besides governors, many other prominent individuals descend from Frances, including Rhode Island Attorney General Daniel Updike and American Revolutionary War Colonels Christopher Lippitt and Christopher Greene. Additional descendants are Rhode Island congressman Tristam Burges, writer Julia Ward Howe, and British Navy Vice Admiral Sir Jahleel Brenton.

Life  Born at Berlin-Wedding, Nagel was the son of a carpenter. After completing his basic schooling he briefly entered into an apprenticeship with a stained glass painter, but soon broke this off. In 1912 he joined the Social Democratic Party. He was a conscientious objector during the First World War, and was imprisoned for refusing to serve. After the war he first began to paint after being exposed to the work of August Macke. He gradually became a staunch communist, joining the Communist Party of Germany in 1920. Throughout the 1920s he was very active in the Berlin art scene, becoming acquainted with K√§the Kollwitz, El Lissitzky, and many other notables. He became secretary of the Workers International Relief, and in 1922 he co-founded the \\"artist's relief\\" division thereof with Erwin Piscator. In 1924, Nagel joined the Red Group in Berlin and Arnold Zewig and Nagel in 1955 Nagel in 1956, with Otto Grotewohl and Kim Il-sung. accompanied an exhibition of young artists to the Soviet Union.

From 1928 to 1931, he joined the November Group and was a co-founder of the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists. From 1928 to 1932, he was publisher and editor-in-chief of the satirical magazine Eulenspiegel. In 1933, Nagel was elected chairman of the National Association of Visual Artists of Germany, but the election was annulled by the Nazis the next day. When the Nazis seized power, much of Nagel's work was declared degenerate. He was forbidden to paint, and from 1936 to 1937 he was incarcerated in various Nazi concentration camps, including Sachsenhausen. After the end of the Second World War, Nagel lived and worked in Bergholz- Rehbr√ºcke in Potsdam, Brandenburg, later part of East Germany. In 1945, he was one of the co-founders of the Cultural Association of the GDR. In 1952, he moved to Berlin-Biesdorf. From 1956 to 1962, he was the president of the DDR Academy of Arts, Berlin.

Tracing its name back to origins within the Norse language, its original purpose was to link Cardiff Castle to its quay. In this way it became a trade hub and settling point for those incomers who made the city their home. Throughout its history the street has had several pubs, and today has several bars and clubs. Name John Speed's 1610 map of Cardiff, showing Houndemammeby Street Womanby Street in 2005 Originally, before the River Taff was diverted, the street ran north from the town's quay where the modern Westgate Street is sited, towards Cardiff Castle. After Richard Fitz Gilbert de Clare, Duke of Gloucester, rebuilt Cardiff Castle from wood to stone in the 12th century, the medieval town began to spread out from the castle's rebuilt South Gate. The first stage was between Working Street in the east, Quay Street in the south and what was then known as Houndemammeby Street to the west. To the far west, the town was protected by the River Taff, with tents pitched on the land between. All of these street names originated in the Norse language, with Houndemammeby translating as \\"the home or dwelling of the hound man or keeper of hounds\\", or simply \\"huntsman's dwelling\\". Although there is no direct evidence of a Viking presence in Cardiff, the street's names suggest that the Danes could have reached the port town. The name then changed regularly through the next few hundreds of years: *1550: Hunmanby *1715: Home & by *1731: Homandby The word Womanby is early Teutonic language in origins, and translates as \\"the abode of the foreigners\\". It was hence probably used to signify the strangers quarters, where the native Welsh and resident non Anglo- Normans were permitted to live together under the shadow of the mediaeval castle. History =New Trinity chapel= In 1638 William Ebery, the Vicar of St Mary's Church, Cardiff, and senior members of his congregation were barred from the premises after they refused to read the Book of Sports. These people together with others of a similar mind formed the core of a congregation, that after the English Civil War and subsequent Restoration, in 1696 were granted land in Womanby Street by Alderman John Archer. This allowed them to build the first Trinity Church, later known as a Presbyterian chapel. In 1718, the church was endowed with a nearby dwelling house in Castle Street. After a fire gutted the building, the church was rebuilt and reopened in 1847. In 1888, Trinity Church amalgamated with Llandaff Road English Congregational Church, and sold the church in Womanby Street, funding the construction of the current New Trinity English Independent chapel in Cowbridge Road East, Canton. =Jones Court= The restored Jones Court Jones Court (), which leads off of Womanby Street, was built in 1830 by the Marquis of Bute to house labourers imported for the expansion of Cardiff Docks. Each of the 50 houses had just two rooms, and with no water supply or drainage, the occupants fared poorly in the cholera outbreak in the city in 1849. Cardiff Council acquired Jones Court from the Marquis in the early 1900s, and used it as council offices until post-World War II. In a dilapidated state by 1980, and housing only the cities Weights & Measures office, it was fully restored and reopened by the Lord Mayor in February 1982. During the restoration, it was found that the land had long been used as the city's rubbish dump for the properties on the High Street, again confirming the low social stance of the area. Jones Court is the last remaining example of the over 50 19th-century housing courts that had existed in Cardiff. Trade and entertainment The street has always been a home to many businesses, not least those associated with ale, beer and entertainment. In 1759, an affray took place in the street between the crews of the trader The Eagle of Bristol and the man-of-war Aldbrough. With all participants armed with either swords, pistols, cutlasses, pikes or muskets, they fought between themselves until Edmund Ffaharty lay dead, and many others were wounded. Investigated by the sheriff's men, they passed the case to the coroner's court with the brief to hush the whole affair up. Thus, the court ruled that Ffaharty had been shot by a \\"person unknown\\", and that no further investigation was required. Charles Evans, writing to the Evening Express in 1901, said: =Cardiff Boat= The Cardiff Boat was a seaman's hostelry, that would welcome all sailors who made it past Tiger Bay and into the centre of the city. =Horse and Groom= One of the earliest pubs in Cardiff, and also one of the smallest, the Horse and Groom was said to be haunted by a poltergeist. A very traditional pub until a make-over in the last decade to match the more trendy hostelrys on St. Mary's Street, it was originally adorned with years-old pictures of the regulars behind the bar, and in 1967 there still existed an open brass gas pipe for lighting one's choice of smoking implement. In 2013, the site of the Horse & Groom became the home of Fuel, A rock bar and grassroots live music venue. =Red Cow= The site of the Red Cow pub, which was on the western side of the street opposite Clwb Ifor Bach until the early 1900s, became its sister establishment the Y Fuwch Goch public house (English The Red Cow). In 2011 it was the site of live music venue The Full Moon, which went into liquidation in April 2017. Three weeks later, former staff organised a fundraiser to rescue the space and opened The Moon, a grassroots live music venue & club. Above it sits Bootlegger, a prohibition-style gin and cocktail bar. =Clwb Ifor Bach= In 1983, Clwb Ifor Bach (known in English as \\"The Welsh Club\\"), started on Womanby Street, to promote the Welsh language in Cardiff by engaging Welsh-medium youth entertainment. It has since proved a successful launchpad for various Welsh- medium groups, including Super Furry Animals, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci and Catatonia. Modern street In 2011, as part of Cardiff Council's redevelopment and pedestrianisation of St. Mary's Street, known as the Castle Quarter, Womanby Street and Quay Street were included in the scheme and given refurbishment. Started in February 2010, Castle Quarter, in keeping with the nearby Cardiff Castle, was designed on a Victorian architecture theme, including Victorian-style street lighting and commemorative seating. Work commenced on Womanby Street and Quay Street in February 2011. The street was repaved and pedestrianised, with access permitted solely for delivery vehicles from the North (Castle Street) and permit holders from the South (Quay Street). Works were completed in Spring 2011. In the mid 2010s the Womanby Street became the venue for a number of 'popup' markets, where temporary restaurants and stalls were hosted in the street's bars and clubs. In November 2014 the Oxjam Takeover music festival took place in the street's bars and clubs, involving 45 bands with proceeds going to the Oxfam charity. Appearances in the media Due to its age and enclosed nature, Womanby Street has appeared in a few media productions. It first appeared in a television serial adaptation of Jack Jones's novel series Off to Philadelphia in the Morning (1978), starring Connie Booth. In the 2000s, it appeared in the revival of BBC1's Doctor Who (episodes: \\"The Empty Child\\", \\"The Age of Steel\\"), and the children's spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures (episode: \\"Warriors of Kudlak\\").

In 1960 Paterson joined Innisfail, who he captain-coached to victory in the Foley Shield and Paterson played for North Queensland, Queensland and Australia. The Test in Sydney against France featured five Queenslanders in the forward pack. The following year Paterson toured New Zealand with the Australian team, playing in both Tests against the Kiwis. This was after the Queensland team, of which he was now a fixture, retained the interstate crown against New South Wales. Paterson spent a third year in Innisfail but, instead of playing with all the clubs, he joined the Babinda Colts as coach. In 1963 the Herbert River coaching position lured Paterson to Ingham. Once again he represented North Queensland, including the match against New Zealand, and again went on to play for Queensland against the Blues. He returned to Townsville to coach Centrals and the Foley Shield team in 1964, taking his team to the Shield final. Paterson continued to play for North Queensland and Queensland until 1966 when he was again a member of Townsville's Foley Shield final team before retiring. =Post playing= In 2008, Australian rugby league's centenary year, Paterson was named at second- row forward in a Queensland Rugby League Northern Division 'Team of the Century'.

While it considers that Catholics should not favour abortion in any field, it recognises that Catholics may accept compromises that, while permitting abortions, lessen their incidence by, for instance, restricting some forms or enacting remedies against the conditions that give rise to them. It is accepted that support may be given to a political platform that contains a clause in favour of abortion but also elements that will actually reduce the number of abortions, rather than to an anti-abortion platform that will lead to their increase.Frank K. Flinn, J. Gordon Melton (editors), Encyclopedia of Catholicism (Facts on File 2007 ), p. 5 United States Before the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that opened the door to the legalization of abortion, the right-to-life movement in the U.S. consisted of lawyers, politicians, and doctors, almost all of whom were Catholic. The only coordinated opposition to abortion during the early 1970s came from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Family Life Bureau, also a Catholic organization. Prior to Roe v. Wade decision, abortion was not a high priority for Catholic bishops in the United States. Neither was abortion a prominent issue in American politics prior to Roe v. Wade. It was not a major platform plank for either party in the 1968 and 1972 elections. In the 60s and early 70s, there was a shift as a number of Catholics and Southern whites abandoned their traditional affiliation with the Democratic party and began to support the Republican party. This shift is evidenced by the fact that Nixon received only 33% of the Catholic vote in the 1968 election compared to 52% in 1972. As a group, Catholics represented a quarter of the nation's electorate and were now one of the nation's largest swing groups. Both parties began to aggressively woo both the Catholic voters. Although the Catholic hierarchy could not dictate who Catholics voted for, they did have a substantial influence over the faithful in their dioceses. Politicians were aware that the bishops could employ significant time, energy and money to support the issues that were important to them. From their perspective, the bishops were eager to regain some of the influence that their predecessors had wielded in the earlier part of the 20th century. After Roe v. Wade, the involvement of the Catholic hierarchy in American politics increased to an unprecedented level, with bishops devoting more time, energy and money to the issue of abortion than any other single issue. The substantial role of the Catholic Church in the abortion debate has received much attention in the American media . Mobilization of a wide-scale pro-life movement among Catholics began quickly after the Roe v. Wade decision with the creation of the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC). The NRLC also organized non-Catholics, eventually becoming the largest pro-life organization in the United States. Connie Paige has been quoted as having said that, \\"[t]he Roman Catholic Church created the right-to- life movement. Without the church, the movement would not exist as such today.\\" In the two years following the Roe v. Wade decision, U.S. bishops focused on passage of a Human Life Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would ban abortion. =A Pastoral Plan for Pro-Life Activities= In November 1975, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) and the United States Catholic Conference (USCC) published a document titled \\"A Pastoral Plan for Pro-Life Activities\\" that outlined a strategic plan for anti-abortion activities by members of the Catholic clergy and laity. Laurence Tribe describes the document as \\"an extraordinary organizational blueprint for political action.\\" The plan called for a \\"comprehensive pro-life legislative program\\" that would push for \\"passage of a constitutional amendment providing protection of the unborn child to the maximum degree possible.\\" To accomplish its goals, the plan called for the formation of committees at the state level that would coordinate the political efforts in the dioceses and congressional districts of that state. Each diocese was to have a pro-life committee that would push for the passage of a \\"constitutional amendment to protect the unborn child.\\" The plan also called for the creation of an \\"identifiable, tightly-knit and well-organized pro-life unit\\" in each congressional district to track voting records of elected officials vis-a-vis abortion and to mobilize resources for political action. Despite the concern of some bishops that the Pastoral Plan was narrowly focused on just the issue of abortion, the plan was adopted in 1975 and subsequently re-approved in 1985 and 2001. =1976 presidential election= Abortion became an issue early on in the race for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination. Senator Birch Bayh, who had chaired hearings on a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, finally broke his silence on the issue and came out against the passage of such an amendment. Bayh's stance opposing the amendment was soon echoed by Frank Church and Sargent Shriver, a practicing Catholic. The Democratic Party began to fracture over pro-life and pro-choice lines. Pro-life Democrats sought a candidate sympathetic to their stance on the constitutional amendment. However, conservative Democrat George Wallace declared his support for such an amendment. Laurence Tribe attributes Jimmy Carter's victory in the Iowa caucuses to his having \\"fudged\\" his position on abortion although Carter publicly denied having done so. On the Republican side, Ronald Reagan declared his support for a constitutional amendment that would effectively ban abortions. Although President Ford won the nomination of his party, Reagan's supporters were able to push through a plank in the party platform that called for a \\"constitutional amendment to restore the protection of the right to life of unborn children.\\" The Democratic party platform included a plank that asserted that it was \\"undesirable to attempt to amend the U.S. Constitution to overturn Roe v. Wade. In an attempt to mollify the displeasure of U.S. bishops, Carter arranged a meeting with six bishops to clarify his position that, although he had not yet seen a specific phrasing that he could support, he remained opposed to abortion and pledged that he \\"would never try to block\\" an amendment banning abortion. This stance failed to placate the bishops. Attempting to capitalize on Carter's failure, President Ford signaled his agreement with the bishops' position by inviting the NCCB/USCC's Executive Committee to the White House. After the meeting, the bishops declared that, while they were not totally satisfied with Ford's position, they were encouraged by it and that they felt that \\"support for the concept\\" of a constitutional amendment was more important than agreement on a \\"specific kind of amendment.\\" However, in Laurence Tribe's estimation, abortion played a less significant role in the general election than it had in the primaries. When asked to rank fifteen issues in order of importance, voters ranked abortion as fifteenth. According to exit interviews conducted by CBS News, the Catholic vote wound up favoring Carter by 54% to 44%, a wider margin than the general electorate which favored Carter over Ford by just 50% to 48%. =1980 presidential election= During the 1980 presidential election, Ronald Reagan made the pro-life cause a key issue in his campaign. He endorsed a constitutional amendment banning abortion, promised to appoint pro-life judges to the federal bench and prohibit the use of federal funds for abortions except where necessary to save the life of the mother. According to the results of exit interviews published in the New York Times, Catholics favored Reagan over Carter by 51% to 40%, a margin very similar to that of the general electorate.New York Times, November 9, 1980, p. 28 =1984 presidential election= By 1984, the Republican party was fully aligned with traditional religious values including the pro-life movement. Whereas Catholics had generally voted Democratic until the late 1960s, this traditional affiliation had diminished by 1984 to a weighting in favor of the Republican party with abortion being one of the key drivers of the shift. Sharp criticism from Church authorities put Democratic vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro on the defensive throughout the entire campaign, with abortion opponents frequently protesting her appearances with a level of fervor not usually encountered by pro-choice Catholic male candidates such as Mario Cuomo and Ted Kennedy.Light and Lake, The Elections of 1984, pp. 103, 107‚Äì108. Ferraro was criticized by name by Cardinal John O'Connor, the Catholic Archbishop of New York, and James Timlin, the Bishop of Scranton, for misrepresenting the Catholic Church's position on abortion.Prendergast, The Catholic Vote in American Politics, pp. 26, 187. In a 1982 briefing for Congress Ferraro had written that, \\"the Catholic position on abortion is not monolithic and there can be a range of personal and political responses to the issue.\\" Cardinal O'Connor publicly criticized Ferraro for making this statement. After several days of back-and-forth debate in the public media, Ferraro finally conceded that, \\"the Catholic Church's position on abortion is monolithic\\" but went on to say that \\"But I do believe that there are a lot of Catholics who do not share the view of the Catholic Church\\". The pro-choice group Catholics for a Free Choice placed an October 7, 1984, full-page ad in The New York Times titled \\"A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion\\". The advertisement stated that \\"direct abortion ...can sometimes be a moral choice\\" and that \\"responsible moral decisions can only be made in an atmosphere of freedom from fear of coercion.\\" =Debate within the Catholic hierarchy= Reagan's attempt to confirm and build up his ties with the religious base of his party injected a strong religious overtone to his re- election campaign. This new focus on religious values in politics caused the American bishops to evaluate the extent to which Catholic morality should interact with politics and public policy. The Catholic hierarchy was split because some bishops such as Archbishop Bernard Law and Archbishop John O'Connor favored focusing on the single issue of abortion whereas others such as Cardinal Joseph Bernardin favored a more balanced approach that brought attention to other issues such as the threat of nuclear warfare and the elimination of poverty. Cardinal Bernardin asserted that the Catholic hierarchy would be \\"severely pressured by those who wanted to push a particular issue with little or no regard for the rest of the bishops' positions.\\" In order to prevent this from happening, Bernardin proposed that the bishops promote a \\"consistent ethic of life\\". Bernardin argued that, while it was not necessary or possible for every Catholic to be engaged on every issue, it was nonetheless \\"both possible and necessary for the Church as a whole to cultivate a conscious explicit connection among the several issues.\\" Initially, Bernardin spoke out against nuclear war and abortion. However, he quickly expanded the scope of his view to include all aspects of human life (according to the church's definition). In one of the first speeches given on the topic at Fordham University, Bernardin said: \\"The spectrum of life cuts across the issues of genetics, abortion, capital punishment, modern warfare and the care of the terminally ill.\\"Overberg, Kenneth R. S.J.:\\"A Consistent Ethic of Life\\", Catholic Update, St. Anthony's Press, 2009 Bernardin said that although each of the issues was distinct (euthanasia, for example, was not the same as abortion), nevertheless the issues were linked since the valuing and defending of (human) life (according to the Catholic definition) were, he believed, at the center of both issues. Cardinal Bernardin told an audience in Portland, Oregon: \\"When human life is considered 'cheap' or easily expendable in one area, eventually nothing is held as sacred and all lives are in jeopardy.\\" =Subsequent presidential elections= Margaret Ross Sammons describes the 1984 presidential election as the \\"pinnacle of the abortion debate\\" but asserts that the issue of abortion continued to be prominent in subsequent presidential elections. For example, in 1996, Cardinals Bernard Law and James Hickey urged Catholics not to re-elect President Bill Clinton after he vetoed a law banning intact dilation and extraction. In 2000, Catholic leaders reacted negatively to speculation that Governor George W. Bush was considering the pro-choice Catholic governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Ridge, as a possible running mate. In 2004, a number of bishops publicly declared that they would deny communion to Senator John Kerry because of his willingness to support laws protecting abortion rights despite a personal opposition to abortion. Although Kerry continued to receive communion throughout the election campaign, Sammons asserts that Kerry's campaign was sufficiently damaged by the threat to withhold communion that it may have cost him the election. Sammons argues that President George W. Bush was able to win 53% of the Catholic vote because he appealed to \\"traditional\\" Catholics. =Relationship with Protestant anti-abortion activists= Because the Catholic Church in the U.S. took the lead in opposing the spread and legalization of abortion and the Protestants were comparatively slow to mobilize, Protestants who were anti-abortion came to respect the national organizations that the Catholics had established to co-ordinate their efforts. =Pro-choice Catholic politicians= Many controversies have arisen over the church's treatment of Catholic politicians who support abortion rights. There has been controversy in the United States over whether Catholic politicians who promote legalization of abortion should be denied communion, as demanded by some American pro-life Catholic organizations and a few bishops. Both in the United States and elsewhere, excommunication of such politicians has been envisaged but has not been applied. Some bishops have threatened to refuse communion to these politicians. In some cases, bishops have stated that the politicians should refrain from receiving communion; in others, the possibility of excommunication has been suggested. According to David Yamane, \\"the vast majority of bishops in the United States ... have remained silent on the issue.\\" Those remaining silent include prominent conservatives such as Cardinals Justin Rigali of Philadelphia and Edward Egan of New York. Cardinals William Keeler of Baltimore and Theodore McCarrick of Washington have declared that they would not withhold communion as a means of sanctioning pro-choice Catholic politicians. Yamane points out that the number of bishops who have made public pronouncements against pro-choice Catholic politicians amounts to less than 10% of the American Catholic hierarchy. Because only a small percentage of American bishops are in favor of withholding communion from politicians and the majority are opposed, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops decided in 2004 that such matters should left to the discretion of each bishop on a case-by-case basis.Sandro Magister, \\"Obama's Pick for Vice President Is Catholic. But the Bishops Deny Him Communion\\" Those bishops who support denying communion, including Raymond Leo Burke, base their position on Canon 915.\\"America's 'Most Complete' Catholic Newsweekly\\" Most American bishops do not support refusal of communion on these grounds.John Allen, \\"Antiabortion imperative more complex than acknowledged: John Allen: bishops' views on abortion\\" These statements of intent from church authorities have sometimes led American Catholic voters to vote for candidates who wish to ban abortion, rather than pro-choice candidates who support other Catholic Church positions, such as war, health care, immigration, or lowering the abortion rate. Penalties of this kind from bishops have targeted Democrats, although a number of prominent Republican politicians are also pro-choice. In 1990, John Cardinal O'Connor of New York suggested that, by supporting abortion rights, Catholic politicians who were pro-choice risked excommunication. The response of Catholic pro-choice politicians to O'Connor's comment was generally defiant. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi asserted that, \\"There is no desire to fight with the cardinals or archbishops. But it has to be clear that we are elected officials and we uphold the law and we support public positions separate and apart from our Catholic faith.\\" Politicians who have been targeted in such controversies include Lucy Killea, Mario Cuomo, John Kerry,Rudy Giuliani, and Joe Biden. Killea's case was the first recorded; Kerry's led to comparisons between his presidential campaign and that of John F. Kennedy in 1960. While Kennedy had to demonstrate his independence from the Roman Catholic Church due to public fear that a Catholic president would make decisions based on Vatican commands, it seemed that Kerry, in contrast, had to show obedience to Catholic authorities in order to win votes. Threats to deny communion have been limited to the United States. Bishops there who support such a course of action cite canon 915 as justification.Sean Winters, \\"Chaput Cites Disunity Among Bishops on Canon 915\\" in National Catholic Reporter, 12 April 2011 Suggested reasons for this uniqueness are a politicization of pastoral practice and abortion's constitutional status as a right.\\"The Word from Rome\\", John L. Allen, Jr. in National Catholic Reporter, 28 May 2004] Europe Abortion is legal in nearly every European country although there is a wide variation in the restrictions under which it is permitted. Restrictions on abortion are most stringent in countries that are more strongly observant of the Catholic faith. In Europe, there have not been threats of denial of communion, although, as in the United States, there have been incidents of church authorities telling Catholic politicians not to take communion and of excommunication being suggested.Der Spiegel.Pope Attacks Mexico City Politicians. May 10, 2007. Pope John Paul II is reported to have given communion to Italian abortion rights supporter Francesco Rutelli, on Jan. 6, 2001.The Word from Rome: May 28, 2004 =Austria= In 1973, Franz Cardinal K√∂nig wrote an open letter to Chancellor Bruno Kreisky opposing free- choice abortion and arguing that it was a \\"renunciation of society's responsibility to protect life, including unborn life.\\" In 1975, the Catholic Church played a significant role in mobilizing support for a \\"people's initiative\\" sponsored by Aktion Leben, an Austrian pro-life organization. Ultimately, abortion on demand remained legal in Austria during the first trimester of pregnancy. =Poland= After the fall of Communism, abortion debate erupted in Poland. Roman Catholic and Lutheran Churches, and right-wing politicians pressured the government to ban abortion except in cases where abortion was the only way to save the life of the pregnant woman. Left-wing politicians and most liberals were opposed to this, and pressured the government to maintain the above-mentioned 1956 legislation. The abortion law in Poland today (\\"Law on family planning, protection of the human fetus and conditions for legal abortion\\") was enacted in January 1993 as a compromise between both camps. It is widely believed that the Catholic Church in Poland is the main obstacle to the liberalization of abortion laws and the reintroduction of sex education in Polish schools in accordance with European standards. However, research studies have shown that Polish Catholics have a wide range of views on sex and marriage. Many Poles, including devout Catholics, complain that the Catholic Church makes demands that very few Catholics want and are able to satisfy. =Belgium= Prior to 1990, Belgium remained one of the few countries where abortion was illegal. However, abortions were unofficially permitted (and even reimbursed out of 'sickness funds') as long as they were registered as \\"curettage\\". It was estimated that 20,000 abortions were performed each year (in comparison to 100,000 births). In early 1990, despite the opposition of the Christian parties, a coalition of the Socialist and Liberal parties passed a law to partially liberalize abortion law in Belgium. The Belgian bishops appealed to the population at large with a public statement that expounded their doctrinal and pastoral opposition to the law. They warned Belgian Catholics that anyone who co- operated \\"effectively and directly\\" in the procurement of abortions was \\"excluding themselves from the ecclesiastical community.\\" Motivated by the strong stance of the Belgian bishops, King Baudoin notified the Prime Minister on March 30 that he could not sign the law without violating his conscience as a Catholic. Since the legislation would not have the force of law without the king's signature, his refusal to sign threatened to precipitate a constitutional crisis. However, the problem was resolved by an agreement between the king and Prime Minister Martens by which the Belgian government declared the king unable to govern, assumed his authority and enacted the law, after which Parliament then voted to reinstate the king on the next day.Wilsford, Political Leaders of Contemporary Western Europe (Greenwood Press 1995 ), p. 30Geoffrey K. Roberts, Patricia Hogwood,West European Politics (Manchester University Press 2003 ), p. 84Els Witte, Jan Craeybeckx, Alain Meynen,Political History of Belgium (VUB University Press 2010 ), p. 266Encyclopedia of World Constitutions(Facts on File 2006 ), p. 92 The Vatican described the king's action as a \\"noble and courageous choice\\" dictated by a \\"very strong moral conscience.\\" Others have suggested that Baudoin's action was \\"little more than a gesture\\", since he was reinstated as king just 44 hours after he was removed from power. Asia =The Philippines= In the Philippines, abortion is illegal except where it is deemed necessary to save the life of the mother. Since the nation is predominantly Catholic, the Church is highly influential and its opposition is credited with frustrating efforts to liberalize the nation's highly restrictive abortion laws.

The main base of the Salinero Apaches was along the Pecos River in Texas, and their range extended northward along this river into southeastern New Mexico.

Heade married in 1883 and settled in St. Augustine, Florida after a lackluster career as an itinerant artist. He was patronized by Floridian Henry Morrison Flagler, an oil and railroad magnate, who regularly purchased his works. The NGA believes this personal and professional stability stimulated the production of the still-life paintings of Heade's last years. The NGA writes, \\"Certainly works such as Giant Magnolias on a Blue Velvet Cloth, with their striking contrasts of brilliantly lit flowers and leaves set against a dark background, are among the most original still lifes of the nineteenth century. They are also for many observers strongly sensual, their lush colors, full, curving contours, overall sense of opulence, and implied perfumed scent of the flowers suggestive, perhaps, of female nudes languidly reclining on luxurious couches.\\"  References  * NGA: Giant Magnolias on a Blue Velvet Cloth Paintings by Martin Johnson Heade 1890 paintings Collections of the National Gallery of Art Still life paintings Flower paintings ","title":"Giant Magnolias on a Blue Velvet Cloth"},{"id":"34233408","text":"Pardillana is a genus of grasshoppers in the family Acrididae.

The flight was operated by Fischer Brothers Aviation, doing business as Northwest Airlink, and was operated by a CASA C-212 aircraft. On March 4, 1987, the plane crashed while attempting to land. Nine of the 19 passengers and crew on board were killed in the accident. Flight Northwest Airlink Flight 2268 was crewed by captain David W. Sherer (45) and first officer Shawn D. Manningham (25). At 2:30 p.m. after being cleared for a visual approach to Runway 21R and while just 60‚Äì70 feet above the ground, Flight 2268 banked left in a descent and then rolled right. The twin-engine turboprop aircraft struck the ramp area inside and to the left of the runway threshold, flipping over, and then striking a catering truck before bursting into flames. Nine of the 19 people on board the aircraft died, including both pilots. Autopsies determined the cause of death to be smoke inhalation and burns. Federal investigators said the nine victims may not have died if their seat cushions had been treated with fire retardant. Three people on the ground were also injured in the accident. Investigation The job of investigating the crash was made difficult due to the aircraft having neither a flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder. Shortly after the investigation was started, it was learned that Captain Sherer had been cited twice for unsafe flying. Records showed that had his license suspended for 15 days in 1979. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was \\"the captain‚Äôs inability to control the airplane in an attempt to recover from an asymmetric power condition at low speed following his intentional use of the beta mode of propeller operation to descend and slow the airplane rapidly on final approach for landing. Factors that contributed to the accident were an unstabilized visual approach, the presence of a departing DC-9 on the runway, the desire to make a short field landing, and the higher- than-normal flight idle fuel flow settings of both engines. The lack of fire- blocking material in passenger seat cushions contributed to the severity of the injuries.\\" See also * Northwest Airlines Flight 255, another aviation disaster that took place at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport in 1987. * Air Cara√Øbes Flight 1501, a similar plane crash in Guadeloupe where the investigation was hampered due to the absence of flight recorders * American Eagle Flight 5452, a similar crash in Puerto Rico just two months later also involving a CASA C-212.

Likewise, a minimal left ideal is a nonzero left ideal of R containing no other nonzero left ideals of R, and a minimal ideal of R is a nonzero ideal containing no other nonzero two-sided ideal of R. In other words, minimal right ideals are minimal elements of the poset of nonzero right ideals of R ordered by inclusion. The reader is cautioned that outside of this context, some posets of ideals may admit the zero ideal, and so the zero ideal could potentially be a minimal element in that poset. This is the case for the poset of prime ideals of a ring, which may include the zero ideal as a minimal prime ideal. Definition The definition of a minimal right ideal N of a ring R is equivalent to the following conditions: *N is nonzero and if K is a right ideal of R with , then either } or . *N is a simple right R-module. Minimal right ideals are the dual notion to maximal right ideals. Properties Many standard facts on minimal ideals can be found in standard texts such as , , , and . * In a ring with unity, maximal right ideals always exist. In contrast, minimal right, left, or two-sided ideals in a ring with unity need not exist. * The right socle of a ring \\\\mathrm{soc}(R_R) is an important structure defined in terms of the minimal right ideals of R. * Rings for which every right ideal contains a minimal right ideal are exactly the rings with an essential right socle. * Any right Artinian ring or right Kasch ring has a minimal right ideal. * Domains that are not division rings have no minimal right ideals. * In rings with unity, minimal right ideals are necessarily principal right ideals, because for any nonzero x in a minimal right ideal N, the set xR is a nonzero right ideal of R inside N, and so . * Brauer's lemma: Any minimal right ideal N in a ring R satisfies } or for some idempotent element e of R. * If N1 and N2 are nonisomorphic minimal right ideals of R, then the product equals {0}. * If N1 and N2 are distinct minimal ideals of a ring R, then * A simple ring with a minimal right ideal is a semisimple ring. * In a semiprime ring, there exists a minimal right ideal if and only if there exists a minimal left ideal. Generalization A nonzero submodule N of a right module M is called a minimal submodule if it contains no other nonzero submodules of M. Equivalently, N is a nonzero submodule of M which is a simple module. This can also be extended to bimodules by calling a nonzero sub- bimodule N a minimal sub-bimodule of M if N contains no other nonzero sub- bimodules. If the module M is taken to be the right R-module RR, then clearly the minimal submodules are exactly the minimal right ideals of R. Likewise, the minimal left ideals of R are precisely the minimal submodules of the left module RR. In the case of two-sided ideals, we see that the minimal ideals of R are exactly the minimal sub-bimodules of the bimodule RRR. Just as with rings, there is no guarantee that minimal submodules exist in a module. Minimal submodules can be used to define the socle of a module.

Critically the mixtape received positive reviews, with reviewers saying that the mixtape was one of the \\"freshest\\", another reviewer said that the mixtape is making \\"Noise in the R&B; spectrum\\". The concept follows the story of Aiko having a meeting with a label and she was told by people at the label \\"I love everything but when you come into these meetings you have to sell yourself.\\" After the meeting Jhene came up with the concept \\"I‚Äôm not a slave to anyone; I‚Äôm sailing my soul instead of selling it.\\" To promote the mixtape Aiko was joined by Grammy-nominated R&B; singer Miguel on a one off free secret tour on Sunday, July 15. The free tickets were given away at the Key Club box office on July 6 from 11AM-5PM on a first-come, first-served basis while. The concert started 7:00pm and finished as 9:30pm, lasting a duration of two and a half hours. On October 21, 2012 Aiko released a music video for the song \\"My Mine\\".

She released a video for her single \\"NO L.O.V.E\\" which debuted on BET 106 & Park when she was 15 years old. Jhene was set to release her self-titled debut album but the album was never released due to tension at the record label Epic, in which Aiko asked to be released from the label. Aiko then began to focus on school. Later at the age of 20, Aiko became pregnant by American R&B; singer O'Ryan and gave birth to a baby girl named Namiko Love Browner on 19 November 2008. Development After Aiko gave birth to her daughter, six months later she began to work and develop on the mixtape. Aiko stated that she was going through trouble at this period in her life saying \\"At the time I was going through so much in my life that it was so easy to write the songs. I had just had a baby and I was dealing with baby father issues and I had a boyfriend. The songs were just coming and coming. I just had so much to say, and when I was signed, I never really got a chance to write my own music. I always wanted to do a mixtape and before I got pregnant I was about to get back into it ‚Äòcause I was working with different producers and things like that. Fisticuffs, who produced the majority of sailing soul(s), I‚Äôve known them for a while and worked with them on different projects. So yeah, the concepts were just coming and it only took about nine months to complete\\". All the songs on the mixtape were written by Aiko, except ‚ÄúJuly‚Äù which was written by Micah Powell and most of the songs were produced by Fisticuffs, except ‚ÄúJuly‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou vs Them‚Äù which were produced by Bei Maejor, ‚ÄúReal Now‚Äù which was produced by Roosevelt, ‚ÄúDo Better‚Äù which was produced by J. Lbs and ‚ÄúGrowing Apart‚Äù which was produced by Tae Beast. The album's artwork was shot by photographer Jay 3. The mixtape also features collaborations from Miguel, Drake and Kanye West as well as others. In 2011, she also began working closely with artists from Carson-based independent record label Top Dawg Entertainment. Concept Aiko described the concept of this mixtape during an interview with Vibe Magazine, in which she said \\"The concept came from the meeting right before I found out I was pregnant. I had a meeting with this label head and at this point I had done so many meetings. I had been doing it for like five years, and I was excited to have the meeting, but it wasn‚Äôt hype. I was going to go in there and be myself, I‚Äôm not going to really care. I wore a little bit of makeup and I dressed how I would dress. Went in there, sang for them, did the whole meeting thing and he was like, ‚ÄòI love your voice, I love everything but when you come into these meetings you have to sell yourself.‚Äô I was just speechless when he said that, and I have no filter when it comes to speaking my mind so I bit my tongue so hard. I wanted to say, ‚ÄòNo! I don‚Äôt have to sell myself. I am me.‚Äô You like me or you don‚Äôt. After that, I found out I was pregnant and I was on Twitter one day and said something about selling your soul, but I spelled it wrong and Chase N. Cashe corrected me. I put ‚Äúsailing souls‚Äù and he said, ‚ÄòOh, that would be a nice name for an album.‚Äù And everything started happening after that. Definitely the whole ‚Äúsailing souls‚Äù thing. A lot of people are still confused about what that means, and it just means to stay true to yourself and go with what you feel. Feeling are really the only thing that is real. I kinda want to convey the message to just be yourself. Don‚Äôt ever lose yourself for whatever reason‚Äîbecause you want to make more money, because you want to be prettier or whatever. I‚Äôm not a slave to anyone; I‚Äôm sailing my soul instead of selling it.\\" Music and lyrics In an interview Aiko described the music and her style on the mixtape saying \\"Honestly, I don‚Äôt think it fits in and I think that‚Äôs why it stands out. It‚Äôs about what I‚Äôm saying. It‚Äôs a marriage [with] real music. Fisticuffs, they don‚Äôt use any samples and they use live instruments a lot of the times in their beats, so I would go in there and I would be singing and they would be making the track. It was like a complete marriage of sound. I wouldn‚Äôt write anything down, just sing it on the mic and come up with everything off the top of my head. I feel like it doesn‚Äôt have to sound like anything that‚Äôs on the radio to be good music\\". Sailing Souls opening track last for a duration of eight-second which features a \\"sped up, reversed intro\\", that then is followed by the album's second song ‚ÄúStranger‚Äù, which lyrically talks of a \\"woman going through similar issues of the heart, but seemingly with different men\\". ‚ÄúHoe‚Äù is produced by Fisticuffs, and features a \\"steady drum beat\\", the song also includes guest vocals from Miguel and Gucci Mane. The fourth track \\"July\\", features vocals from rapper Drake, which has \\"a lighter feel on production and a simple, repetitive piano chord\\". ‚ÄúMy Mine,‚Äù used the topic Cannabis as metaphor for love. ‚ÄúSailing NOT selling,‚Äù featuring a verse from Kanye West, lyrically the song \\"attack a hot topic in music right now\\". Do Better Blues,‚Äù which was produced by J.LBS talks about \\"the fearful truth to an ex, saying she is probably NOT better off without him\\". ‚ÄúHigher‚Äù is described as a crazy, \\"sexy, cool song\\" with suggestive lyrics in regards to Cannabis, ‚ÄúBreak me down/Roll me up/Boy I can be your pipe dream‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou vs. Them,‚Äù is described as \\"hauntingly beautiful song\\", that lyrically describes \\"the apprehension of getting into a relationship, of which, she may be referring to a person or God\\". \\"Space Jam\\" Aiko wrote on the subject of when she found out her brother had been diagnosed with cancer. Critical reception Sailing Soul(s) received critical acclaim from music critics. SoulCulture.co.uk praised the album calling it one of the \\"freshest\\" mixtapes saying \\"As R&B; mixtapes go, this has to be one of the freshest out in a long time, especially considering there have been a constant flow from male rappers. The tracks are predominantly chilled out, the production is on point from start to finish and as well as the collaborations from the big dogs, there are also solid features from little known rappers HOPE, Roosevelt and Lite\\". Rap-Up.com also praised the album saying it made \\"Noise in the R&B; spectrum\\" saying the following \\"Drake, Miguel, and Kendrick Lamar all showed up on the effort, which mixed her sensually sweet voice with hip-hop-centric beats\\". Gstylemag.com reviewed the album positively saying \\"Usually when you think smooth flow with slow to mid tempo songs you think nap time but this album definitely kept my attention and there was not any point that I felt the urge to fast forward. I did find myself repeating the song Hoe feat Miguel and Gucci Mane more than others at times. Each artist added just the right amount of flavor to the song to make it work and were careful not to outshine each other. The lyrics are what mostly gets me about this song-it‚Äôs a song about an aggressive female that knows what she wants but doesn‚Äôt want to give the guy the impression that that‚Äôs how she usually gets down. It is sung from both the female and male perspective and it doesn‚Äôt degrade or disrespect as the title or the worlds ‚ÄúFeat Gucci Mane‚Äù may suggest.\\" One reviewer said \\"This mixtape is amazing, it showcase's Jhene's beautiful voice and heartfelt lyrics (she wrote every song.) This mixtape gives me the same feeling I got when I 1st heard Drake's mixtape \\"So Far Gone.\\" I believe that every woman can relate to Jhene in 1 way or another. I connect with her music because I am an emotional woman who loves love & honesty and this mixtape leaves me wanting to hear more from Jhene Aiko.\\"http://zakialacey.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/zakia- review-jhene-aikos-sailing-souls.html Track listing ;Sampling credits * \\"Hoe\\" samples Gucci Mane vocals from \\"Pretty Girls\\" as performed with Wale. * \\"Popular\\" interpolates \\"Wanksta\\" as performed by 50 Cent. * \\"Sailing NOT Selling\\" samples Kanye West vocals from \\"Eyez Closed\\" as performed with Snoop Dogg.
