It chronicles Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong) and takes place during the period of Taiwan under Dutch rule. Hilton Yip of the Asian Review of Books stated that \\"Lord of Formosa is not so much a biography as it is a historical action novel with Koxinga as the main character.\\"  Original post (14 June 2018) Plot The book, which has a total of 566 pages, covers Koxinga's life, from the period which he was taken from Japan to China, and includes his expulsion of the Dutch. Koxinga's adventures, including two naval battles with the Dutch, make up portions until the mid-point of the novel, when the Manchus sack his estate. The second half of the novel ends after Koxinga defeats the Dutch, and he dies of an illness. (web page 2/2) The novel has a focus on areas in Taiwan in and around the forts established by the Dutch. A portion of the novel takes place Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta, Indonesia). Incidents of rape, murder, and sex are occurrences. According to Yip, the novel's Koxinga is \\"a flawed but driven warrior\\" who \\"is not romanticized or lionized, but neither is it easy to develop much admiration or sympathy for him.\\" Bradley Winterton of the Taipei Times stated that \\"Koxinga himself is generally shown as an unsympathetic figure, but someone who nevertheless usually keeps his word.\\" Yip stated that there were relatively few Taiwanese characters while many of the characters were Dutch, and that the latter \\"perhaps unsurprisingly, feature prominently\\". Background Bergevelt was born in the Netherlands, and has heritage from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Bergvelt's father, an employee of Philips, worked in Taiwan, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Bergvelt, who had lived in the latter two due to her father's work, came to Taiwan in 1982 so she could study Chinese at National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU); she did so for one year. 19 at the time, she first learned about the history of Taiwan. After her studies ended, she visited her parents until they departed in 1988. She had last visited Taiwan in 1995. Bergvelt wrote a thesis about the Dutch rule and Koxinga's removal of the Dutch for her Chinese/history programme at Durham University; the professors who read the thesis believed it was entertaining and told her that it had similarities to a novel. Therefore she used it as the basis of a novel. The period she took to write the novel was about three and one half years. The Dutch translation was published in 2015; the interest initially coming from Dutch publishers was the reason why the Dutch translation was published first. The original English version was published on 26 April 2018. Reception Yip gave the novel four of five stars. He stated that overall it was \\"a fantastic action-packed novel that showcases this major historical figure from Taiwan‚Äôs past.\\" He described the pacing and flow as having \\"little confusion and no lull\\" and that \\"Bergvelt links the various events and places well\\". He criticised how Koxinga and other characters \\"can at times seem one-dimensional\\" as well as the novel not having many details about portions of Taiwan away from the Dutch forts. Winterton stated that the original English version is \\"excellent\\".

Works Senlin Ascends and its sequels, the Books of Babel series, deal with the adventures of the schoolteacher Thomas Senlin, who is separated from his wife Marya at the foot of the immense Tower of Babel, and spends the rest of the narrative searching for her. The novel was uncommonly successful for a self-published work, due in large part to notice gained during the 2016 SPFBO competition, praise on social media from author Mark Lawrence, and a positive review by Emily May, a popular reviewer on Goodreads. As a result, it was republished, together with the sequel Arm of the Sphinx, by Orbit Books in 2018. The third book in the series, The Hod King, came out in 2019. The finale of the series, The Fall of Babel, will be published in 2021. Bancroft's inspirations for the story are numerous and include Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino, Midnight's Children by Salman Rushdie, The Castle by Franz Kafka, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. The Tower of Babel in the books is not intended to be the tower of biblical fame. Bancroft has explained that the setting is \\"more of an alternate universe than an alternate history. The Tower is not part of our timeline or this reality\\". Bancroft took the name Senlin from the 1920 poem \\"Morning Song of Senlin\\" by Conrad Aiken. The cover art for the three published books was created by Ian Leino, a childhood friend of Bancroft. Senlin Ascends was well appreciated by critics. Publishers Weeklys starred review described the \\"brilliant debut fantasy\\" as \\"steampunk and epic, surreal and yet grounded in believable logistics\\". Tor.com likewise praised the imaginative setting, and called the novel \\"incredibly creative in its conception and no less confident in its crafting\\". The Washington Post included it in its five best science fiction and fantasy novels of 2018, describing it as \\"a classic hero‚Äôs quest, elevated by creative world building and memorable characters\\". However, Strange Horizons wrote that \\"the fact that a woman‚Äôs sexuality is the root cause of the conflict (...) and that the woman is immediately removed from the narrative\\" are indicative of the novel's problems with the portrayal of women. The scope of Senlin's saga and the cast of characters expand in Arm of the Sphinx. Publishers Weekly's starred review claimed that the second installment \\"not only matches but adds to the notable achievements of the first\\". A review on Barnes & Noble's Sci-Fi & Fantasy Blog compared Bancroft to \\"a master craftsman building a workshop around himself\\". In the third book, The Hod King, Senlin carries out a mission for the enigmatic Sphinx while he and his friends continue the search for Marya. The Los Angeles Times praised the book as \\"an easy, joyful read; the author‚Äôs vibrant prose, simply incredible\\". The Fall of Babel, the final book in the series, was originally scheduled for release in 2020, but Bancroft asked his publisher for an extension because, among other reasons, he \\"suffered some setbacks with the draft, including the deletion of a hundred pages or so.\\" Bibliography ;The Books of Babel # Senlin Ascends (self-published 2013, Orbit 2018), # Arm of the Sphinx (self-published 2014, Orbit 2018), # The Hod King (Hachette UK 2019), #The Fall of Babel (2021)  Music  Bancroft was the vocalist and bass player in the band Dirt Dirt along with his wife Sharon Bancroft (keys, saxophone), Red (guitar, backing vocals), and Benjamin Viss (drums, backing vocals).

The story takes place in Westchester, Miami during the late 1970s and '80s. Blanco is known for being the first Hispanic and openly gay poet of the United States. This book follows his early life as he faced cultural and identity differences within his own family and the hardships of coming of age. In the memoir, he substitutes the real names of his family and friends to tell his story. For example, \\"Caco\\" is Richard's older brother Carlos.  Plot  Riqui's family immigrated from Cuba during the early 1970s, escaping Fidel Castro's takeover. He opens up the memoir by detailing his family's journey to Miami. His grandmother paid for his whole family to travel to go from Cuba then Spain, then New York, then finally Miami. When Riqui's family finally settled in G√ºecheste, Miami they went to work at a bodega, a store owned by his uncle. Riqui's family held tight to their Cuban Heritage and only ate Cuban food. However, Riqui had a hard time accepting this as he wanted to eat American food like Pop-Tarts and Cool Whip. His grandmother, Abuela, would frequently disapprove because real food was Cuban food to her. Abuela did not want to shop at Winn-Dixie out of fear of the American language barrier. Riqui insisted and finally his grandmother gave him money to shop at Winn-Dixie. She later started enjoying American products and offered to cook Riqui a traditional American Thanksgiving dinner, she referred to as San Giving. However, his extended family decided to bring and merge the Cuban food with the American food, which frustrated Riqui. Towards the end of thanksgiving Riqui connects pilgrims to his family and how their journeys to America are similar. Riquis family continued to strengthen their ties to Cuba. His grandfather, Abuelo, wanting to hold unto this life from Cuba created an animal farm in his backyard. This consisted of a Chickens, a rooster, some bunnies and a dog. This however, was not allowed and Animal Control made Abuelo get rid of his animals. Riqui was devastated when his Abuela killed all the chickens and served it for dinner. Things get even worse when Riqui purchases a rug-making kit, that he had been saving up for, and his Abuela takes it away from him and warned him about seeming like un maric√≥n. She then later helps the family go to Disney World by paying for everyone's ticket. The trip to Disney World, in his fathers Chevy Malibu, came with challenges for the whole family. The boys had to endure their parents Spanish songs on the radio, and Riqui had to poop on the side of the highway while getting photographed by his Mother. Due to the language barrier Riqui's older brother, Caco, had to be the interpreter on the trip so his family could communicate. Caco had to not only help his father at the service plaza, but also when he gets pulled over for speeding, that led to the brother feeling embarrassed. Once the family arrives to Disney, Riqui is excited for Cinderellas castle and El Ratoncito Miguel, Mickey Mouse. However, Riqui was disappointed when he couldn't go into Cinderellas castle since he wanted to play dress-up. He ends up buying a Mickey mouse doll and melting his crayons in the back of his dads precious car. Riquis family goes on vacation in Miami to Copa Hotel. There he meets Yetta Epstein who shares about her life. Riqui gets left behind by his older cousins and brother. When Yetta invited Riqui to keep her company he accepts. They later talk about Yetta past as a Jewish woman and how she is from more than one place. She likes coming from many places and shows Riqui that he should feel good about his Cuban background. Riqui learns about the old Miami from Yetta and he shares about the Cuba his parents always talk about it. Riqui and Yetta bid their farewells towards the end of Riqui's vacation. As Riqui starts getting older he gains weight and his Abuela helps him find a job at their families Bodega, El Cocuyito. He later is forced to take out the cashiers daughter to her Quinces by his Abuela in an attempt to make him Un Hombre, a man. Riqui does that to make his Abuela happy, but he was not attracted to his girl or any girl yet. During high school, Riqui's best friend Julio makes him ask out Anita. Riqui takes her out even though he felt no romantic feelings towards her. He later takes her to the dance where he kisses her, but when he still feels nothing he realized he was different than the other boys. At El Cocuyito, Riqui is getting stronger and gaining more responsibility. When a middle aged man named Victor starts working there, Riqui becomes intrigued with him. Victor was an artist and he tells Riqui about his past in Cuba. He tells him that he was jailed for loving another man so he fled Cuba. As the two grow closer to each other, Riqui starts becoming attracted to Victor. On Victors birthday, Riqui goes to his house, but things take a turn when Victor made a sexual move towards him and Riqui resisted. Riqui came to terms that he was a gay man and Victor told him he needed to accept himself in order to be ready. As the book is coming to end, the family is preparing for their weekly picnic at El Farito. The family also invited extended family for the barbecue his mom was preparing. Ariel was a family friend about Riqui's age. He brought a pig for Riqui's mom to roast and shared memories about Cuba with Riqui and his family. It seemed to bug Riqui how much Ariel knew about Cuba and how easily he connected with his Cuban heritage. However, Ariel talks to Riqui and tells him to visit Cuba and stay connected. After the party Ariel and Riqui never meet again. As the memoir comes to an end, Riqui talked about the death's in his family and a touching visit to Cuba with his mother.  Main characters  * Riqui: Riqui is Richard Blanco in this memoir, he is the protagonist and narrator of the book. Riqui was a young boy who grows up a little chubby. He had a difficult relationship with his grandmother due to differing opinions, but considered her his best friend. Riqui loved American culture and, at times, distanced himself from the traditions of his Cuban family. Growing up Riqui realized that he was different from most of his friends. Instead he kept to himself and was attracted more to the arts and books. When he finished high school, Riqui understood more of his attraction to other men and felt closer to his Cuban roots. * Abuela: Riquis grandmother came from Cuba and acted like she still lived there. She brought Riqui's family from Cuba and lives with them during the time of Memoir. She is described as a strong character who always speaks her mind and a penny-pincher. She was often suspicious, watching him closely and often pushed him to become the man that was expected. Abuela feared that Riqui would not become un hombre, a man. * Abuelo: This is Riqui's grandfather. He is described to have strong ties to Cuba. He started a little farm in their backyard by sneaking animals in. Riqui would often help him tend to the animals. One day, Animal Control demanded he to get rid of all his animals. This causes Abuelo to become furious because he cared for his animals and thought America was a place of freedom. * Mam√°: Riqui's mom is a strong character as well in the book. She was also very connected to her Cuban roots. She cooked and helped around the house a lot. She struggled with the language barrier and the huge changes involved in coming to America. She tried her best to maintain the closeness of her family. Riqui's mom grew tired of always making the food and paying for everything and she made Riqui's Abuela start helping out around the house. * Pap√°: Riqui's dad found it hard to adapt in America. He faced challenges as well, like the language barrier. He was humiliated when he is at a gas station and was unable to say \\"windshield washer\\" and instead repeated \\"winchil wacher\\". His two sons were often embarrassed by their parents and their difficulty learning English. * Caco: This is Riqui's older brother. He was a high-spirited young boy who tended to be Riqui's babysitter and ally. Caco and Riqui often fought, but they bonded over the shared embarrassment they felt regarding their parents. This was evident when Caco became the family interpreter during the family trip to Disney. = Secondary characters = * Yetta: An elderly Jewish lady that Riqui met while on vacation at the Copa Hotel. Riqui's older cousins fled, and thus Riqui decided to keep her company when Yetta extended an invitation. Yetta shared that she loved that she was not just from just one place, but from everywhere. She also talked about the old Miami while Riqui shared about the Cuba of his parents. Riqui and Yetta were able to bond over their stories. * Victor: A middle-aged man Riqui developed an interest in. Victor was a Cuban who went to prison for being openly gay. Riqui found himself attracted and interested in Victor, but did not quite know why. However, this does not turn into a real relationship and they both go their own way. * Julio: Riqui's best friend in high school. Julio was a little bit of a troublemaker and very outgoing. He encouraged Riqui to get Anita's number. Even though Riqui did not feel any attraction to her, he reluctantly agreed. Through this endeavor, Riqui realized he did not have feelings for Anita. Julio later died in a car accident, which broke Riqui's heart. * Ariel: A family friend from Cuba who joined Riqui's family towards the end of the book for a barbecue. Ariel talked about his memories in Cuba and all of the distant relatives and their stories. Ariel helped Riqui connect to the lives of people in Cuba and told him to visit his family.  Themes  * Growing up: Riqui's path to becoming self- aware of who he is and being accepted by his family and friends. Growing up encompass a wide range of milestones including new responsibilities and hardships. At the beginning of the book, the reader see how hard it was for Riqui to be himself and live with his grandmother's expectations. He grew up as chubby kid and his grandmother put him to work in the hopes of becoming the man she expected him to be. He was constantly criticized by his grandmother and this made it hard for him to grow up. This book is a coming out for Riqui who later figured out his attraction for other men for the first time and how he handled that. * Connection to heritage: The strong ties this family has to Cuba and their struggle to adapt in America is evident. They have grounded their identity within their Cuban heritage, but Riqui struggled to figure out where he fit in, not quite Cuban and not quite American. Towards the end, Riqui's connection to his Cuban heritage strengthened. As he got older, he was able to merge these two identities into one. * Family: This Latino family is very close. Their closeness and strong bond is what constantly spurred fights and arguments. However, there is a sense of accountability and loyalty within this family. From the beginning, there was a clear difference between Riqui and his family. He was a young boy wanting to celebrate a traditional Thanksgiving the American way, but was later disappointed when his family combined Cuban and American food. There were also times when they seemed like a normal family, when they went to Disney World for the first time. Riqui and his older brother tried to hide the embarrassment they felt regarding their parents.

It can be found burrowing in soft sediment in shallow water in the Pacific Ocean around the coasts of China and Japan. It is often associated with a polychaete worm with which it forms a commensal relationship. Taxonomy and evolution This species was first described by the British malacologist George Brettingham Sowerby III in 1889 (or 1888). It has a long fossil record, having been found in formations in southwestern Sakhalin dating back to the lower middle Miocene, with numerous occurrences in the Neogene and Quaternary periods in northern Japan. In the fossils it is possible to observe changing patterns of drilling predation over the aeons, with the sites of drill holes varying with time, perhaps due to a change in the principle predators, from Glossaulax to Cryptonatica. Almost unispecific beds of fossils of Glycymeris yessoensis are found in the Onma Formation in central Japan. Distribution and habitat Glycymeris yessoensis is native to the north central Pacific Ocean where it occurs in the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan, its range extending as far north as the Kamchatka Peninsula. It is found burrowing in sand at depths ranging between the intertidal zone and . Ecology Glycymeris yessoensis can live for 45 years. It is a filter feeder, drawing water in through one siphon and expelling it through another. It often acts as a commensal host to the boring polychaete worm Polydora glycymerica. This worm burrows into the bivalve's shell creating a \\"U\\"-shaped burrow near the mollusc's siphon, intercepting some of the food particles from the feeding current created by the mollusc.

The cabinet was made up of holdovers from Papen's which featured many right-wing independents or German National People's Party (DNVP). The government was followed by the Hitler Cabinet after Schleicher's own resignation. This was to be the last Weimar government before the rise of Nazi Germany. Composition The Reich cabinet consisted of the following Ministers: Actions During von Schleicher's short time as Chancellor he attempted to prevent the rise of the NSDAP by offering Hitler the Chancellorship in exchange for him remaining as minister of defense however this was rejected. Schleicher eventually agreed to a deal in which Hitler would become Chancellor, von Papen would become Vice-Chancellor and the cabinet would be composed of non-NSDAP members. Schleicher also attempted to split the NSDAP by convincing Gregor Strasser to leave by offering him the Vice-Chancellorship and control of Prussia. After negotiations with Strasser failed he went to Hindenburg with a proposal to declare a state of emergency to control the NSDAP and dissolve the Reichstag, but Hindenburg refused. His final action as Chancellor was to ask Hindenburg once more to declare a state of emergency and when this was refused once more he resigned. =State of Emergency= Schleicher's main goal during his Chancellorship was to have a state of emergency declared by Hindenburg in order to prevent Hitler from gaining power, prevent another election, and to restore stability to the Weimar government. However, he would not declare a state of emergency with his authority and Hindenburg was concerned that he could be impeached for doing so. By January multiple party leaders were demanding another election, with the leader of the Centre party stating that it would be unconstitutional to stall the elections if there was no need for a state of emergency. Following Schleicher's resignation the election was held in March with the NSDAP gaining 92 seats.

When asked if some aspect of the species relates to Bautista, Anderson replied \\"Not really\\", and that the intention was to recognize Bautista's contribution to baseball in Canada. Anderson grew up a fan of Bautista's former team, the Toronto Blue Jays.  Description  Dorsal view Sicoderus bautistai inhabits forests of Hispaniola, typically associated with vine plants upon which they feed with a specialized long proboscis. The integumentary surface is black and shiny, Adults achieve a length of up to , with males at least and females at least . The antenna insertion point occurs at the middle in the rostrum in the female, and just beyond in the male. The rostrum is 1.00‚Äì1.08 times the length of the elytra in males, and 1.09‚Äì1.17 times in females. The eyes occur at the rostrum's midlength, separated by about one half its width. The globose prothorax is widest at the middle and characterized by very few large, deep punctures and erect setae scattered throughout. The elytra have numerous erect setae, and the humeri are non-angulate and fully reduced. In males, the first ventrite has a small cluster of fine seta, but is not raised near the posterior margin. For the female, it is uniformly convex. The fifth ventrite in males has fine, shallow setae on an impression covering about one half its length, whereas the female's is uniformly convex. The male has an aedeagus whose internal sac has a pair of basal sclerites that are long, curved, and join at the anterior. The profemora are very small with a dull tooth, whereas the mesofemora and metafemora do not have a tooth. Each tarsus has a basal tooth. It can be distinguished from closely related species S. ramosi, S. guanyangi, and S. turnbowi by the presence and size of the femoral teeth, the structure of the first male ventrite, and the structure of the internal sac's basal sclerite in the male.

It is made up of the three-arched bridge of the sluice gates and the about statue of the Immaculate Conception rising above. It is situated in Borgo Incile, a locality south of the city of Avezzano, in the Fucine plain, Abruzzo, Central Italy. The facility necessary for the drainage of the Fucine Lake connects the outer drainage canal to the underground emissary which is served by the system of the Tunnels of Claudius in Mount Salviano. The monument was made in 1876 by architect Carlo Nicola Carnevali.  History  Entrance to the Claudian-Torlonian emissary Madonna of the Inlet Bridge of the sluice gates The head of the main emissary of the Fucine Lake was made built by Alessandro Torlonia in 1876 following the occurred drainage of the lake. The Roman banker resumed the works and plans of 18 centuries earlier by which Emperor Claudius carried out the first drainage of the Fucine basin after the impressive digging works of the Tunnels of Claudius and the Roman emissary occurring between 41 AD and the year of inauguration, 52 AD.. With the fall of the Roman Empire a lack of facility maintenance followed, which, most probably after the effects of a serious earthquake occurring in 508 AD,. favoured the clogging of the underground canal, with the resulting natural reflood of the Fucine basin where the waters were soon back to the levels prior to the first drainage. The Claudian plan was resumed in an effective way starting from 1856, 18 centuries later, by Alessandro Torlonia who had the sections of the main emissary enlarged and further vents and inclined shafts built which served the above tunnels.. On the higher part of the tunnel, in some points, the original Roman work is visible. In 1876, having achieved the second drainage which was officially declared with a document of 1 October 1878, the Roman architect of the House of Torlonia, Carlo Nicola Carnevali, built the head of the emissary, a monumental work made up of the bridge of the sluice gates and the statue of the Immaculate Conception, situated in Borgo Incile south of Avezzano. From the area of the cleaning works of the Roman inlet and the nearby areas connected to the Fucine territory, several items emerged: four reliefs, depicting scenes from the Fucine Lake and a Marsian town, some inscriptions on marble plaques reporting distance measures in feet, graffiti, some work materials such as a large bucket and an oil-lamp, as well as several archaeological items such as busts, epigraphs and cappuccina tombs. The working facility regulates the flow of the waters coming from the numerous Fucine canals which pour them into the outer drainage canal. Two basins, the small loading basins, and the fares allow to regulate the waters flowing out into the emissary, the tunnel crossing Mount Salviano at the base for more than before intersecting the course of the Liri River, on the opposite side of the mountain under the town of Capistrello. The chief site engineer, French Alessandro Brisse, chose the materials for the construction of the work, while architect Carlo Nicola Carnevali supervised the architectural plan, also building in 1876 the adjoining garden in addition to the monument of the emissary head.. A second emissary was had built in 1942 by the Torlonia with the purpose of compensating for the main tunnel in case of extraordinary repairs. It starts from the intersection point of the Roman emissary with the outer drainage next to one of the water storage basins. The second tunnel, built southwards, ends up in Canistro next to one of the hydroelectric power plants built by the Torlonia with the aim of generating power for the operation of the Avezzano paper and sugar mills.  Description The Fucine Inlet is a Neo-Classical style work built by using local stone blocks for the main body of the building, carved out of the quarries that were located in the mountainous territory of Capistrello. It develops on two levels, the lower one below the plane of site which is almost high and contains the safety systems, and the higher one which houses the engine-room. In the centre, on a block rises the about statue in local stone depicting the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which was re-built after the 1915 earthquake. A crescent of moon was fixed at its base, while a twelve-star crown lies upon the Virgin's head. The bronze elements call up the Biblical Apocalypse. Of the original statue, which collapsed following the 1915 Marsica earthquake, only some fragments remain, which are exposed in the park of Villa Torlonia. The so-called Madonnone dell'Incile (literally, \\"Big Madonna of the Inlet\\") rises above the three-arched bridge of the sluice gates. The structure features two water storage basins, one with a trapezoidal shape and the other hexagonal, and three gates (or locks). The first one separates the major hexagonal basin from the forebasin through a gorge. The gate pillars are made up of three round arches. Two side staircases lead to the canal wharfs.

British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Jeremy Hunt criticised the verdict, claiming that it had been done in a five-minute hearing, an allegation denied by Sulaiman Hamid al-Mazroui. Non- governmental organisation Human Rights Watch said that the trial \\"was marred with such due process violations that there‚Äôs no way it could have been seen as a fair trial\\". Alex Younger, the head of MI6, said that he \\"couldn't understand how our Emirati partners came to the conclusions they came to.\\" After the verdict, the University of Birmingham voted to boycott its new campus in Dubai, in protest of the decision. Staff at Exeter University, where Hedges was previously an undergraduate, passed a motion calling for the suspension of its academic relationships with the UAE. Tejada set up an online petition which attracted over 200,000 signatures. Pardon and release On 26 November 2018, Hedges was pardoned by UAE President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, as part of the UAE tradition of pardoning people on the country's National Day. After his release, Hedges went to the British embassy in Abu Dhabi, from where he later travelled back to the United Kingdom. He arrived at Heathrow Airport on the morning of Tuesday, 27 November 2018, where he was reunited with his wife, whom he praised for having tirelessly campaigned for his release. In December 2018, Hedges said that he was speaking to a specialist psychiatrist about the effects of his imprisonment. Complaint against Foreign Office In May 2019 Hedges' lawyer lodged a complaint against the Foreign and Commonwealth Office alleging it failed in its duty of care to negotiate Hedges' release. Hedges and his wife are also requesting an independent inquiry. Publications *Hedges, M.J. & Cafiero, G.

He was the founder of Radio Fresh FM in 2013, an independent radio station reaching audiences in Idlib, Aleppo, and Hamah provinces. Activism At the beginning of the 2011 Syrian uprising, Fares took part in hundreds of demonstrations against President Bashar Assad's regime and continued to see it as the biggest enemy. Fares used to take pictures of demonstrations and spread them on the internet, which later developed to the idea of creating a media center in his city, Kafr Nabl. He grabbed the attention of the world's media for his gipping, sometimes sarcastic protests and pro-democracy banners including English language banners which called for peaceful revolution in Syria. Fares was a prominent critic of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as well as militant groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which was in control of the area of Idlib where Fares was killed. Fares also ran the Kafranbel Media Center, which gained prominence in the Syrian uprising against the Assad regime with their use of English-language protest banners which were shared on social media. Fares has been subject to several assassination attempts because of his work in the revolution. On 28 January 2014, he was shot three times in his chest and was taken to an emergency room. Fares survived this assassination attempt after a long surgery. He had also been abducted and tortured by al-Qaeda affiliated militants. =Radio Fresh= Fares set up Radio Fresh FM in 2013, in order to provide \\"independent news to the Syrian people\\". The station was setup in Kafranbel, and reaches audiences in Idlib, Aleppo, and Hamah provinces. Radio Fresh broadcasts information critical of both radical Islamist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIL, as well as the regime of President Assad. The Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militant group, which controls the area, had ordered Radio Fresh to stop broadcasting music and to take women off the air. Radio Fresh responded by playing sounds such as tweeting birds and ticking sounds, clucking chickens and bleating goats, and modifying women's voices with computer software, as a sarcastic gesture against these demands. Radio Fresh provided media training for more than 2500 young men and women to allow them to be able to become citizen-journalists and cover the news in Syria. Radio Fresh is partly funded by the Human Rights Foundation, which organises the Oslo Freedom Forum. Fares spoke at an Oslo Freedom Forum event in 2017. Assassination On 23 November 2018, Raed Fares was shot by unknown assailants in his hometown, along with friend and fellow opposition activist Hamoud Jneed. The shooting resulted in both their deaths. Fares's killers have not been identified, but The Guardian reported that they \\"waited in a van outside an office the two men shared, followed them through the market, attacked their car then shot them when they tried to escape\\". Fares's death was met with widespread condemnation and shock, and occasioned international tributes. The National reported that local opposition activists blamed the Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militant group for the attack, though HTS has not claimed responsibility.

The rules resemble both those of Piquet as well as those of Mariage (Sixty-six). Parlett refers to it as a trick-and-draw version of the international classic, two-hander, Klaberjass.  History  Recorded as early as 1802 in Denmark as Frantsfuusspillet, the rules of Tatteln were first published in Austria in 1829 and, as Tattelnspiel, in Germany in 1830. According to the Oeconomische Encyclop√§die, by 1858 it had become \\"a very popular game in Austria, although it bears no originality, being a combination of the well-known game of Piquet and the archaic game of Mariage, nevertheless it has received acclaim; it is harder than the latter [Mariage], but easier than the former [Piquet].\\"Tatteln in Kr√ºnitz (1858), Oeconomische Encyclop√§die. The game does not seem to have survived the 19th century, its rules being last recorded by Ulmann in 1890, who calls it Franzefu√ü, but also acknowledges that it is known as Tatteln, D√§rdechen or D√§rde. Modern descendants of this game include Austrian Tartl and the related Hungarian game of Tartli.  Rules = Cards = The game is played with a 36-card, French-suited pack. The ranking of the cards, from highest to lowest, together with their values in card points, is shown in the following table: { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" style=\\"border- collapse: collapse;\\" + Card Values - ! style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Plain suit rank !  ! A  K  Q  J  10  9  8  7  6 - ! style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Value  style=\\"background:#ffefef;\\"  20  style=\\"background:#ffefef;\\"  14  11  4  3  2  10  0  0  0  0 - ! style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Trump suit rank ! style=\\"background:#ffefef;\\"  J ! style=\\"background:#ffefef;\\"  9 ! A  K  Q   10   8  7  6 } In this game, only the card points within the tricks count; the number of tricks won is irrelevant. Only the last trick deviates from the rule, because even if it contains no counters, it scores 10 points. Various card combinations are important for the actual game. For example, three consecutive cards are called a 'tattel' (Tattel, D√§rde or T√§rten ). A run of four cards is called 'quart' (Quart) and one of five cards is called 'foot' (Fu√ü). A quart not only counts in its own right, but also as two tattels, a foot as well as three tattels and two quarts. A set of three equal ranking cards is outbid by a set of four, even if they are lower, otherwise a higher triplet beats a lower triplet and a higher quartet a lower quartet. = Deal and auction = The cards are dealt alternately to the two players, one at a time, until each player holds nine or, according to older rules, eight cards. Then the next card is turned for trumps. The rest of the cards form the talon, from which the players draw one card after each trick. Before the first cards are played, announcements are made. Each player must wait until it is his turn to play to the trick before making an announcement. However, this does not prevent a player declaring that an opponent's announcements void. If an already announced and agreed tattel is accompanied by a card one rank higher or lower in the same suit, then there are two tattels, i.e. one more tattel is added to the already announced tattel, to make a quart. For example: a player announces a tattel of Jacks and then draws the corresponding Queen, then one of them is scored, and then the quart as well, provided that the player has not yet discarded any of the cards that form part of it. = Play = After each trick players replenish their hands from the talon, the winner of the trick picking up first. Thus both players always have eight hand cards as long as the talon has not been exhausted. If a player forgets to pick up, picks up in the wrong order or takes 2 cards at a time, he is in breach of the rules. = Scoring = Tens take their natural place in the ranking. In playing to the trick, suit only has to be followed once the talon is exhausted, i.e. when playing to the last 9 tricks. The trump Seven may be used to 'rob' (rauben) the trump card.If a player fails to win any of the last 9 tricks, he has to pay for the whole round. The calculation of the sequences, tricks and points for which the whole game is played is done in the same way as for Piquet. Tatteln may also be played without trumps.  Variants  The Oeconomische Encyclop√§die describes the numerous variants and additional rules thus: ::\\"The description of this game in the \\"Neuestes Allgemeines Spielbuch\\". (Vienna, 1829)\\", says: \\"Tatteln is no better than the countless other ephemeral phenomena of fashion. Almost every participant soon experienced its inadequacy, encountered inconsistencies and tried to remedy these shortcomings, with or without expertise, by his own additions and omissions, and to give this patching up at least authority within his own circles, which is why the game has very different forms; because in some areas it is played in a completely different way, often against all reason, the only basis for any respectable or competitive game. etc.\\"Kr√ºnitz (1858), Oeconomische Encyclop√§die.

Presumed Guilty was reviewed by David Aaronovitch in The Times. During 2019 he was a regular contributor to the online magazine sp!ked writing about false sexual allegations and criticising what he regarded as institutional shortcomings in police and prosecutorial practices, as well as what he termed the ‚Äòcompensation culture‚Äô which he believed fuelled false historical sexual allegations. Shortly before his death he had completed the final draft of his second novel, provisionally entitled Swinefest, a fictional account of a criminal conspiracy by former pupils to frame a teacher for historical sexual abuse in pursuit of compensation by a school insurer. False allegations of historical child abuse In 2012 Warr was arrested and questioned by police following a complaint of historical child sexual abuse made by a man who had been a pupil at St George's School, Stowmarket, where Warr had taught. The school had already come under scrutiny in 1982 by investigative journalist Roger Cook over headmaster Derek Slade's use of corporal punishment and a 2010 trial which led to the jailing of Slade for sexually abusing boys. Warr was subsequently charged with indecent assault on three former pupils, two from St George's School and one from the Royal Hospital School. Warr pleaded not guilty to all charges and went on trial at Ipswich Crown Court in October 2014. Serious doubts emerged during the trial when evidence was given that he had never taught two of the complainants (both of whom had previously been awarded compensation in a different abuse case at the same school), and that a witness and complainant had changed their stories. The jury returned a unanimous verdict of not guilty on all charges within a matter of minutes of being sent out by the judge. Warr later said that: \\"One of the biggest tragedies of cases like mine is that it makes it more difficult for people who have actually been abused to be believed\\". A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service justified the prosecution, saying: \\"We were satisfied there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and it was in the public interest to prosecute\\". Warr appeared on BBC Newsnight after his acquittal to discuss the way in which historical allegations are handled by police and the Crown Prosecution Service. He was also interviewed about the case on BBC2 and Radio 5 Live. He subsequently wrote about his 672-day ordeal, including nearly two years on police bail, the trial, and his acquittal in an essay entitled \\"Something Good Has To Come From This\\", published in The Justice Gap magazine in 2015, followed by his 2017 book Presumed Guilty. He also appeared on the Jeremy Vine Show, along with Sarah Champion MP, to debate how historical sexual allegations should be handled by police. Death On 20 February 2020, Warr announced on Twitter that he had a \\"very serious health condition\\"; he died of pancreatic and liver cancer on 22 February 2020.

He worked primarily in Nevada and was a pioneer in the geology of the central Great Basin, producing many publications including multiple USGS geological maps of central Nevada.Wright LA and Troxel BW. 2002. Levi Noble, Geologist. USGS Open-File Report 02-422. https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2002/ofr-02-422/OFR-02-422-508.pdfRoberts, RJ. 2002. A Passion for Gold: An Autobiography. University of Nevada Press. Ferguson was a lifelong friend and colleague of Levi Noble, a mentor to Ralph Roberts, and worked extensively with Siemon Muller. Along with his wife Alice Ferguson, he helped found the Moyaone Reserve community in Accokeek, Maryland.Hanssen, GL. 2007. The Moyaone Reserve. Accokeek Historical Society.  Early life  Henry Ferguson was born on January 21, 1882, in San Rafael, California, the son of Emma Jane (Gardiner) and Henry Ferguson. Shortly thereafter his family moved to the East Coast and Ferguson earned a BA, a BS, and an MA (1906) from Harvard University. Post-graduation geological jobs in Michigan and the Philippines inspired him to do graduate study in geology at Yale University. Although his PhD requirements were finished by 1912, he did not receive his actual degree until an informal oral exam in 1924, with his 1924 USGS bulletin on the Manhattan mining district in Nevada being accepted as his dissertation.  Career  Ferguson was employed by the USGS from 1912 until his mandatory formal retirement in 1952 at the age of 70; he worked primarily as a field geologist. His early work dealt with ore deposits and economic geology; among his early published papers (1914) were two articles describing the geology of mining areas in northern California at Weaverville in the Klamath Mountains and Alleghany in the Sierra Nevada. Subsequently, his primary fieldwork area was west-central Nevada, where his early work continued to describe the geology of mining districts, while his later work was more focused on structural geology. According to geologist Thomas Nolan in 1966, \\"Most of our present concepts of the geology of the western Great Basin are based on [Ferguson's] pioneering work.\\" Ferguson continued to do fieldwork in Nevada after his retirement from the USGS, but in 1957 he suffered the loss of an eye when the steel head of a geologic pick shattered. Ferguson (center) in the field with Levi Noble (left) and James Gilluly (right), 1950s During the 1930s, Ferguson began a two-decade collaboration with the paleontologist and geologist Siemon Muller. They did extensive field mapping in west-central Nevada, culminating in the publication of their 1949 paper, \\"Structural Geology of the Hawthorne and Tonopah Quadrangles, Nevada.\\" Between 1951 and 1954, Ferguson, Muller, Stanley H. Cathcart, and Ralph Roberts (in various combinations) published seven US Geological Survey 1:125,000 quadrangle maps of Nevada, including Winnemucca and Golconda. Ferguson was also a lifelong friend and confidant of Levi Noble. According to Wright and Troxel (2002, p. 26), in the late 1930s the USGS dispatched Ferguson to assist Noble in interpreting and publishing Noble's extensive Death Valley fieldwork. In the 1950s, Noble recalled that \\"the major interpretations in [Noble's 1941 paper about the Amargosa ChaosNoble, LF. 1941. Structural Features of the Virgin Spring Area, Death Valley, California. Geological Society of America Bulletin, v 52, pp 941‚Äì1000] grew out of his conversations with Ferguson.\\" Ferguson made one of the earliest reports of Paleozoic deformation in Nevada in his 1924 bulletin on the Manhattan district.Roberts, RJ, Hotz, PE, Gilluly, J, and Ferguson, HG. 1958. Paleozoic Rocks of North-Central Nevada. AAPG Bulletin, v 42, #12, p 2850. In 1941, Ralph Roberts, on one of his first assignments as a USGS employee, joined senior geologists Ferguson and Siemon Muller on a project mapping the Sonoma Range in Nevada. Roberts' work in the Battle Mountain/Antler Peak area of Nevada, done partially with Ferguson's mentorship and funding assistance, demonstrated that the Paleozoic deformation was a full scale orogeny; this was later described as the Antler orogeny in Roberts' 1949 Yale PhD dissertation. Roberts and Ferguson (along with Preston E. Hotz and James Gilluly) were coauthors on a 1958 paper that helped lead to the discovery of the Carlin gold deposits. Ferguson worked for the USGS Military Geology Unit during World War II (as did his colleagues James Gilluly, Siemon Muller, Levi Noble, and Ralph Roberts);MJ Terman. 1998. Military Unit of the US Geological Survey During World War II. In JL Underwood and PL Guth, Military Geology in War and Peace, GSA Reviews in Engineering Geology, pp 49‚Äì54 this included a heavy-mineral sand analysis by Ferguson that contributed to the identification of the source location of the Japanese balloon bombs.Hathaway, AW. 1993.

Nevada Place Names: A Geographical Dictionary. University of Nevada Press  Personal life  In 1914, Henry married Alice Lowe, a Washington socialite, painter and avid amateur archeologist.Bryson, K. 2013. Images of America: Accokeek. Arcadia Publishing. Following the wedding, they went on a year-long honeymoon in South America, and then settled into a house in NW Washington, D.C. In 1922, Alice Ferguson purchased a farm named Hard Bargain in Accokeek, in southern Maryland, as a weekend retreat for her husband and herself. When Native American artifacts were discovered on the property, Alice started archeological excavations, with the occasional assistance of Henry and his geologist colleagues, such as Thomas Nolan. The area became known as the Accokeek Creek Site and was eventually included in Piscataway Park.Ferguson, AL, and Ferguson, HG. 1960. The Piscataway Indians of Southern Maryland. Alice Ferguson Foundation. Over time, the Fergusons continued to purchase neighboring rural land, and the area grew and developed into a community known as the Moyaone Reserve. Alice died in 1951, but Henry continued to live at Hard Bargain and was active in the community until his death in 1966. In 1954, he established the non-profit Alice Ferguson Foundation in his wife's memory; the foundation remains very active in environmental education and is based at Hard Bargain. In 1957, Ferguson was one of the founders of the Accokeek Foundation, an organization dedicated to preserving the \\"natural beauty along the Maryland shore of the historic Potomac River.\\" In 1953, he donated money to open the first Accokeek public library, and in the late 1960s, the Henry G. Ferguson Elementary School in Accokeek (now closed) was named after him. Henry was known by friends, professional colleagues, and community members as \\"Fergie.\\" In the 1950s and early 1960s, Fergie would deliver eggs around the Moyaone Reserve neighborhood while driving his old wood-paneled Ford station wagon, with neighborhood children hanging onto the sides. Henry Ferguson died in Washington, D.C., on November 29, 1966.

It was built during the Portuguese Restoration War (1640-1668), becoming operational in 1646. The site, which preserves some parts of the fort, is now occupied by a maritime laboratory under control of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon. History Located at the landing place on July 28, 1580 of Spanish troops under the command of Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, the fort of Nossa Senhora da Guia was one of the series aimed at defending Lisbon that stretched from the Tower of Belem close to Lisbon to Cabo da Roca on the Atlantic coast. It was built between 1640 and 1646 in the reign of John IV of Portugal, under the supervision of Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s de Meneses, 1st Marquis of Marialva (1640-1656). In 1646 it was armed with artillery and the garrison consisted of a corporal, three gunners and twelve soldiers. The gate of the fort with coat of arms The fort followed the same rectangular plan used for most of the other forts built along the Cascais coast in the same period. It was able to crossfire with the Fort of S√£o Jorge at Oitavos to the WNW. Its space was divided into two distinct areas, the battery and the accommodation area. By the mid-1700s the structure was already beginning to show signs of degradation, and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake caused further damage. Some restoration was carried out in the 1760s but the main repairs were carried out between 1793 and 1796. At this time the fort was modernized, merlons were built and six openings in the walls were made so that cannons could be used. Work also included remodeling of the internal organization of the fort. Four bartizans were also added, one each in the northwestern and northeastern corners, and another two facing the sea. In 1796 the garrison consisted of just one corporal and two soldiers. By September 1805 it was garrisoned mainly by military invalids and from the end of 1813 it was garrisoned mostly by veterans. Further improvements were carried out in 1829 in the context of the Portuguese Civil War (1828-1834). Additional restoration work was necessary in 1831 and 1832, when the artillery pieces were also restored. In 1832 the garrison consisted of one officer, one corporal, 4 infantrymen and 8 gunners. However the fort was abandoned in 1833 when the army of Miguel I withdrew.

Constructed between 1921 and 1922, the bank was first the headquarters of the Farmers and Mechanics National Bank. Soon thereafter, it became known as the Farmers and Mechanics Branch of Riggs National Bank. In 2005, the building became a branch of PNC bank.  History  In 1814, the Farmers and Mechanics National Bank was established by George Corbin Washington and Romulus Riggs at the intersection of M Street and 31st Street. The bank decided to move its headquarters to the intersection of M Street and Wisconsin Avenue, and constructed the present building between 1921 and 1922, across the street from the Potomac Savings Bank. The building occupied the spot of the former O'Donnell's Drug Store. Side and rear of the bank In 1928, the Farmers and Mechanics National Bank was acquired by Riggs Bank and the Georgetown location was thenceforth known as the Farmers and Mechanics Branch of Riggs National Bank, which name was inscribed atop the building. The dome and cupola atop the rounded corner portico were gilded with gold leaf in 1961 and remains so today. With the designation of the Georgetown Historic District as a National Historic Landmark District on May 28, 1967, the Farmers and Mechanics Bank in Georgetown became a contributing property. In 1985, Riggs Bank decided to restore many of its historic bank buildings, including the Georgetown location, returning the interior, which had been extensively remodeled over the years, to more closely model its original design. The neoclassical fa√ßade was also refurbished. When Riggs Bank was acquired by PNC in 2005, ownership of the Georgetown bank was transferred and it began operating as a branch of PNC.

Early life and career Bradbrook was born in 1972 and grew up in South Elmsall in West Yorkshire. Her father worked at a mine in South Kirkby. She studied molecular biophysics at the University of Manchester, gaining a PhD. She carried out post-doctoral work in India and France. From 2003 to 2017 she was 'director of strategy' at Citizens Online, an organisation promoting wider internet access for disabled users, including launching a 'Fix the Web' campaign in November 2010. Activism An interest in animal rights led Bradbrook to join the Green Party at the age of 14. She has been involved in various campaigning groups in Stroud, including a 2010 to 2013 period as voluntary director of Transition Stroud, an anti-fracking protest, various actions in opposition to the building of a local incinerator, including a naked protest, and an early Extinction Rebellion roadblock in Merrywalks, Stroud. In 2015, with George Barda, she set up the group Compassionate Revolution (which morphed into Rising Up!, out of which came Extinction Rebellion). ‚ÄúBradbrook had been involved in the Occupy movement and campaigns around peak oil, but they failed to take off.‚Äú In 2016, she went on a psychedelic retreat to Costa Rica, \\"where she took ayahuasca, iboga and kambo, in search of some clarity in her work.‚Äù That experience \\"made her change her approach‚Äù to campaigning. Soon after returning she met Roger Hallam and together they came up with Extinction Rebellion. She wants to raise awareness of the dangers from anthropogenic climate change and believes that only civil disobedience on a large scale can bring about the change that is needed. Personal life Bradbrook has been married twice, the first time to Jeffrey Forshaw. She has two sons. She lives in Stroud as does her ex-partner Simon Bramwell, who is also a co-founder of Extinction Rebellion.

Career Herry joined the National Board of the Indonesian Badminton Association (PBSI) since 1993. The badminton trainer initially handled the Pratama National squad of Indonesia of the upcoming talents. Starting in 1999 he became the main trainer and coach for men's doubles at the National training center Pelatnas Cipayung, taking over from Christian Hadinata who became the Director of National Pelatnas of PBSI. When he started his job as a coach at the National training office, Herry was still a PB Tangkas club coach. But then he decided to let go his club ties to choose the status as a free independent coach with no conflicts of interest. In fact, Herry was not even worried when he was cut off from the National Board of PBSI in 2007. At that time, the male doubles coaching was entrusted to Sigit Pamungkas. Without responsibilities at the National training center until 2011, Herry chose his time for activities outside of badminton. He spent most of his time with his hobby of bird chirping and aviary business. When he was first badminton trainer in Cipayung in the period from 1993 to 2008 he produced a number of world-class men's doubles pairs. For instance Chandra Wijaya / Tony Gunawan (1999 All England champions and 2000 Olympic champions), then Chandra Wijaya / Sigit Budiarto (2003 All England & 1997 World Champions), and Flandy Limpele / Eng Hian (2004 Olympic bronze medalist). He returned to Cipayung in 2011 after a few years absence to replace Sigit Pamungkas again. At that time, the Indonesian men's doubles sector was experiencing a little decline in achievements. Regeneration didn't happen as smooth at first as when Ricky Subagja / Rexy Mainaky played and their success was continued by Chandra Wijaya / Sigit Budiarto in the period of his first term as National coach. The mainstay pair of Markis Kido / Hendra Setiawan actually left the National training when he returned. Slowly but surely, Herry began to show his positive influence and increased the Indonesian men's double achievements once again. The return of Hendra Setiawan to the national training was also an important milestone. He was then paired with Mohammad Ahsan who was previously a duet with Bona Septano. Unexpectedly, this new couple skyrocketed in a short time. Hendra Setiawan / Mohammad Ahsan also won the famous All England Open title in 2014 and 2019, they also won a gold medal at the 2014 Asian Games. His most recent prot√©g√©s are Marcus Fernaldi Gideon and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo the current worlds number one pair who won the All England Open title two years in a row in 2017 & 2018 and also a Gold medal at the 2018 Asian Games. As men's doubles head coach of PBSI Herry now slowly transfers his men's doubles coaching duties at different selected tournaments to assistant coach Aryono Miranat with whom he works intensively together. At the end of 2018 veteran coach Herry Iman Pierngadi received the Indonesian Sports Award as \\"Coach of the Year\\".https://sport.detik.com/sport-lain/d-4314962/yang-terbaik-di-indonesian- sport-awards-2018 Personal life Herry does not have the experience as a former top badminton player.

She is also the founder of the Koungkuey Design Initiative, which works with communities to rebuild public spaces. She campaigns for more green space in cities and is a 2018 TED fellow.  Education  Voraakhom loved the flooding in Thailand as a child. She studied at Chulalongkorn University. She earned her bachelor's degree in landscape architecture in 2001, when she was awarded a medal for exceptional academic performance. She completed her graduate studies at Harvard University. During graduate school she co-founded the Koungkuey Design Initiative (KDI), a nonprofit design organisation that helps communities develop their neighbourhoods. She returned to Thailand in 2006.  Career  Kotchakorn has taught landscape design at Chulalongkorn University since 2010. She is founder and chief executive at Landprocess, a landscape architecture firm in Bangkok. She has been named one of Thailand's best architects, one who is fostering social change. In 2015 Kotchakorn worked on the Thailand Pavilion at the Milan Expo. The pavilion showcases the role of water in Thai agriculture. She was awarded a fellowship from The Asia Foundation in 2016. She opened the Siam Green Sky roof garden in Siam Square in 2015. In 2017 she founded the Porous City Network. Bangkok, a city of over eight million people, is only 1.5 metres above sea level.

She won a Chulalongkorn University design competition for a park that increases urban resilience by capturing runoff, the 28 rai (11 acre) Centenary Park at Chulalongkorn. The park is built on a three degree incline and contains artificial wetlands and underground cisterns that can hold one million gallons (3.8 million litres) of water. Kotchakorn was inspired by King Bhumibol Adulyadej's concept of creating kaem ling, 'monkey cheeks', to capture rainwater runoff for later use. In 2019 she will open a 91 rai (36 acre) park at Thammasat University. In December 2019, Thammasat University's Rangsit campus opened Asia's largest urban rooftop garden. The 7,000 m2 space, designed by Kotchakorn, is designed to help offset some of the impacts of climate change, such as flooding. \\"Urban rooftop farms are an easy and effective climate solution, and should be the norm.\\", she said. The rooftop farm is open to anyone who wishes to grow rice, vegetables, or herbs according to the university. In 2018 Kotchakorn was named a TED fellow. She has written for City Green.

GuySpy has challenged Facebook's community standards homophobic as they allowed similar images that showed females by other pages. The app's 2013 billboard campaign in Vancouver received complaints. The complainant alleged that the advertisement offended standards of public decency. The ad was showing two men, one sitting on the other's back with the phrase \\"Taste the difference\\" According to the council's opinion the words crossed the line of the acceptability of Clause 14.

Camp B'nai Brith has been recognized as a pioneer in the world of community-service camps in North America. CBB offers camping to children and senior citizens on a sliding fee scale based on the family's finances, with fundraising activities subsidizing those who cannot afford to pay. History In 1920, the Mount Royal Lodge of B'nai Brith Canada set out on a project to provide summer holidays for underprivileged Jewish boys. The first campsite was located on a farm about 40 miles from Montreal, and only those children whose parents could not afford to pay for camping services were accepted. The counsellors and directors were student volunteers from McGill University, and repurposed army tents were used as sleeping quarters. The camp emphasized Jewish culture and Zionism in its activities. Camp B'nai Brith moved to its current location in 1929. All capital and operating costs were financed by Mount Royal Lodge until 1942, when Camp B'nai Brith became a constituent agency of the Combined Jewish Appeal. From 1954 to 1964, the camp grew to accommodate over 1000 campers, most of whom received scholarships to attend. In the late 1970s, a seniors' vacation retreat was created at the camp in conjunction with the Cummings Golden Age Centre. CBB now runs a variety of different programs over the course of the summer and runs two main camper sessions of about 425 campers each.

Drone-in-a-box systems, on the other hand, deploy autonomously from a box that also functions as a landing pad and charging base. After carrying out a pre-programmed list of instructions, they return to their ‚Äúbase‚Äù to charge and/or upload information. Stand-alone drone-in-a-box systems are composed of three main components.: a ground station that charges and shelters the drone, the drone itself, and a computer management system that allows the operator to interact with the system, including multiple drones. The ground station also provides battery charging and conducts health checks, and can be made of either metal or carbon fibre.  History  The first attempted use of drone-in-a-box technology involving a ground state was by the US Air Force in 1968 using a high-altitude SIGINT project called Compass Dwell by the Air Force Security Services. The AFSS hoped to solve two problems they faced with the Combat Dawn program: high RPV development costs and high operations and maintenance costs. Compass Dwell was optionally piloted and designed to be disassembled and packed into an Air Force C-141 Starlifter Jet Transport, an effort to solve the deployment problems inherent in previous helicopter recovery methods. This technology was an important way for the continental US to respond to any spot on the globe, enhancing the country's weapon systems. Ultimately, Compass Dwell ended up not catching on because of foreign airspace control restrictions and the propeller design, which went against the Air Force's idea of a futuristic, unpiloted plane. The project was more exploratory than a legitimate candidate for adoption. In 2018, multinational Italy-based manufacturer and distributor of electricity and gas Enel completed the first industrial deployment of an autonomous drone-in-box system to carry out round- the-clock operations at their Torrevaldaliga Nord power plant facility, becoming the first global corporation to purchase a drone-in-a-box solution .  Uses = Military = Drone-in-a-box systems have been a focus of interest for militaries as a less expensive and less dangerous alternative to human-led communications, resupply, and offensive missions. In January 2017, the Department of Defense and Strategic Capabilities Office completed a successful demonstration of an autonomous ‚Äúswarm‚Äù of ‚Äúmicro-drones‚Äù at China Lake, California. In February 2017, the US Marine Corps ran a drone-in-a-box trial to test the viability of using both autonomous helicopters and smaller drones to resupply front-line troops without the need for a human pilot. = Sea and Port Terminals = Autonomous, drone-in-a-box systems have been used to survey the progress of construction and capture visuals during the construction of the Gulf Port in Haifa, Israel. In 2018, CERTUS Port Automation signed an agreement to deploy the autonomous drone-in-a-box solution to enhance port security, becoming the first company in the sector to embrace the technology. = Security = Drone-in-a-box technologies have been used to bolster security in commercial and military applications, automatically deploying when alarms are tripped and providing close-up footage or carrying out scheduled patrols. Additionally, companies have used drone-in- a-box technologies to support security at large events = Agriculture = Companies have also embraced drone-in-a-box technology to survey farms and golf courses by using multispectral cameras that can be tuned to respond to specific light wavelengths, including some infrared. Using these cameras fixed on drone-in-a-box systems, drones can detect health-related changes in vegetation. = Utilities = Drone-in-a-box solutions are used today to support operations at power plants, capturing aerial video and data to be streamed to personnel in real time. The scheduled missions can enable human/vehicle detection, alert operators to gas/water leaks and monitor for other maintenance abnormalities. In 2018, Israel-based Percepto partnered with Italian electricity and gas provider Enel to launch their on-site autonomous drone system at the Torrevaldaliga Nord power plant.

The station was built a short distance north-east of station of the Taff Vale Railway. In 1888 the station was renamed Cardiff (Rhymney). Passenger returns from 1920 show that 800,000 passengers were using the station per annum.

These reductions may also be called polynomial many-one counting reductions or weakly parsimonious reductions; they are analogous to many-one reductions for decision problems and they generalize the parsimonious reductions. Definition A polynomial-time counting reduction is usually used to transform instances of a known-hard problem X into instances of another problem Y that is to be proven hard. It consists of two functions f and g, both of which must be computable in polynomial time. The function f transforms inputs for X into inputs for Y, and the function g transforms outputs for Y into outputs for X. These two functions must preserve the correctness of the output. That is, suppose that one transforms an input x for problem X to an input y=f(x) for problem Y, and then one solves y to produce an output z. It must be the case that the transformed output g(z) is the correct output for the original input x. That is, if the input-output relations of X and Y are expressed as functions, then their function composition must obey the identity X=g\\\\circ Y\\\\circ f. Alternatively, expressed in terms of algorithms, one possible algorithm for solving X would be to apply f to transform the problem into an instance of Y, solve that instance, and then apply g to transform the output of Y into the correct answer for X. Relation to other kinds of reduction As a special case, a parsimonious reduction is a polynomial-time transformation f on the inputs to problems that preserves the exact values of the outputs. Such a reduction can be viewed as a polynomial-time counting reduction, by using the identity function as the function g. Applications in complexity theory A functional problem (specified by its inputs and desired outputs) belongs to the complexity class ‚ôØP if there exists a non-deterministic Turing machine that runs in polynomial time, for which the output to the problem is the number of accepting paths of the Turing machine. Intuitively, such problems count the number of solutions to problems in the complexity class NP. A functional problem Y is said to be ‚ôØP-hard if there exists a polynomial-time counting reduction from every problem X in ‚ôØP to Y. If, in addition, Y itself belongs to ‚ôØP, then Y is said to be ‚ôØP-complete. (Sometimes, as in Valiant's original paper proving the completeness of the permanent of 0‚Äì1 matrices, a weaker notion of reduction, Turing reduction, is instead used for defining ‚ôØP-completeness.) The usual method of proving a problem Y in ‚ôØP to be ‚ôØP-complete is to start with a single known ‚ôØP-complete problem X and find a polynomial-time counting reduction from X to Y. If this reduction exists, then there exists a reduction from any other problem in ‚ôØP to Y, obtained by composing a reduction from the other problem to X with the reduction from X to Y.

It was constructed in 1860/61 by settler Thomas Ball in the small settlement of Oruaiti near the Mangonui Harbour, on his own land, for members of the local community. In 1864 a library was established in the building, and in 1892 the land and buildings were sold to the Foster family who retained ownership until 1936 when the church and the land it was sited on were gifted to the Methodist Church. The building was relocated in 1946 to Whangarei and in 1975, the building was relocated to its present site at the Northland Regional Museum in Maunu, Whangarei. The chapel is on the Heritage New Zealand list of historic places as a Category 2 Reg No:3291 and was registered on 22 August 1991.  History  The church was built by settler Thomas Ball and others from kauri Ball had supplied and was opened on 7 April 1861. The report of the time period described the building as octagonal in form, with weatherboard framing and a steep-pitched roof thatched with rushes and was well lit. Ball it was also noted had financed the building of the church at his own expense. In 1864, the church was referred to as the Octagon House of Worship and a small reading library was present. In 1878 a subsidy of ¬£2 towards a public library located inside the church was granted by the government. During 1886, a meeting was held to determine if the building should be renovated with a replacement roof made from kauri shingles, the work was agreed to and carried out by Mr Whitehead and his son Thomas. The building was reroofed again using kauri shingles in 1919. In 1892 the Ball property the church was sited upon was sold to Joseph and Samuel Foster, passing on to the latter and eventually into the ownership of John Foster and retained by the family until 1936 when the church and the site it was located on were ceded to the Methodist Church. In 1933, while still under the ownership of the Fosters the building was moved on skids and relocated closer to the roadside to allow better access. In 1946, the building was moved to Whangarei for use as a church museum.

The book became \\"perhaps the most influential justification for firing Communists and suspected Communists from university and schools in the early 1950s\\" during McCarthyism. History The book began as a full-page article in the New York Times weekend magazine called \\"Heresy, Yes‚ÄìBut Conspiracy, No,\\" published on July 9, 1950. After the formation of the American Committee for Cultural Freedom, spearheaded by Hook, he had the group publish a 29-page pamphlet with the slightly-varied title Heresy, Yes‚ÄìConspiracy, No!. Content=Dedication= Norman Thomas, leader of the Socialist Party of America, frequent candidate for U.S. President, and a long- time friend of Hook Hook dedicated the book to the following: * \\"Norman Thomas: American heretic and democrat * \\"Horace M. Kallen: American individualist‚Äìcultural pluralist\\" =Chapters= The book's comprise a number of essay written by Hook between 1950 (the original article) and the book's May 1953 publication date. Hook had published various chapters earlier in the New York Times, Commentary, the Journal of Philosophy, and the Journal of Higher Education, the American Mercury, School and Society (1939-1946,a journal edited by William Bagley (educator)), the Saturday Evening Post, and the New Leader.

Truman (official portrait) Hook sets out to deal with academic freedom, a topic \\"bound to displease two articulate groups whose influence is out of all proportion to their numbers\\": * \\"Cultural Vigilantes,\\" who have \\"exaggerated the threat of communism as a domestic danger\\" and use fear of Communism \\"to discredit opponents of their pet aversion or panacea,\\" whatever that may be. They use a common fallacy (\\"the undistributed middle term\\") to insinuate that any who does not join them in attacking Communist is therefore a Communist sympathizer (a with us or against us-type argument). * \\"Ritualistic Liberals,\\" who \\"dismiss too lightly the threat of conspiratorial character of the Communist movement\\" and who have \\"invented malicious legends about the state of political freedom in this country which fits the Communist picture of a nation under the iron heel of terror.\\" Compounding conflicts between these two groups, Hook notes, are government officials who suffer from either \\"mediocre intelligence\\" or the \\"most extraordinary ignorance of the nature of the international Communist movement,\\" an example of whose decisions are the Truman Doctrine (i.e., Hook is criticizing New Deal/Fair Deal officials under Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman). =Quotes= Hook quotes John Dewey, his mentor Hook divided the book into two parts, each of which begins with quotes from his choice of most relevant examples: * Part I: ** Socrates: \\"...The unexamined life is not worth living..\\" (from Plato's Apology of Socrates) ** John Dewey: > The democratic idea of freedom is not the right of each individual to do as > he pleases, even if it be qualified by adding 'provided he does not > interfere with the same freedom on the part of others.' While the idea is > not always, not often enough, expressed in words, the basic freedom is that > of freedom of mind and of whatever degree of freedom of action and > experience is necessary to produce freedom of intelligence.\\" * Part II: New School Bulletin (1953): > The New School knows that no man can teach well, nor should he be permitted > to teach at all unless he is prepared \\"to follow the truth of scholarship > wherever it may lead.\\" No inquiry is ever made as to whether a lecturer's > private views are conservative, liberal, or radical; orthodox or agnostic; > views of the aristocrat or commoner. Jealously safeguarding this precious > principle, the New School stoutly affirms that a member of any political > party or group which asserts the right to dictate in matters of science or > scientific opinion is not free to teach the truth and is thereby > disqualified as a teacher. Equally, the New School holds that discrimination > on grounds of race, religion or country of origin either among teachers or > students runs counter to every profession of freedom and has no place in > American education. (New School Bulletin, Vol. 10, No. 19, 5 January 1953 ) (Hook quoted the bulletin again for his posthumously published essay \\"The Principles and Problems of Academic Freedom,\\" written for a symposium at Stony Brook University circa 8 May 1984 and included in the posthumous book Convictions, published in 1990). =Conclusion= Hook concludes: > The chief evil from which the schools suffer is not communism but community > neglect, and the failure to make the common and special needs of the > individual personality their supreme concern. Whatever the responsibilities > of the schools to a democratic society, the responsibilities of a democratic > society to its schools are more basic and more numerous. These > responsibilities have not been adequately discharged. The need for more > schools and better schools, more teachers and better teachers and better- > paid teachers, grows. The perennial need for educational thinking, for a > continuously held philosophy of education, has become more acute in the long > war for survival and freedom into which we have already entered. The task of > American educators is to integrate the insights of liberal thinks from > Socrates to John Dewey, as well as the insights born of wider scientific > knowledge, into a coherent philosophy to make the practice of education > meaningful, excellent, joyful, and free. Reception and criticism In 1953, Robert E. Fitch wrote in Commentary that Hook's book showed \\"balance and reasonableness\\" and also its \\"courage\\" for including teachers themselves in its criticisms. It includes a \\"sharp indictment\\" of the American Association of University Professors' Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure for what Fitch calls its \\"failure to cope realistically with the problem of Communist infiltration.\\" Fitch agrees with Hook that Communist affiliation means \\"active participation in a conspiracy\\" and thereby renders a teacher \\"unfit\\" to teach. He notes Hook's assertion that \\"college and university teachers constituted the strongest and most influential group of Communist fellow-travelers in the United States\\" and agrees with Hook's recommendation that such teachers receive individual care and consideration. In 1980, Victor Navasky acknowledged Hook as the \\"most articulate proponent\\" of the \\"doctrine of conspiracy\\" of the Communist Party USA. He called the book a \\"bible for liberals unwilling to fight for the rights of Communists.\\" In 1997, Christopher Phelps wrote, \\"Hook was a leading figure in the creation of a repressive, censorious atmosphere in higher education, carried out, naturally, under the guise of cultural freedom.\\" Further, he stated that his book \\"became perhaps the most influential justification for firing Communists and suspected Communists from university and schools in the early 1950s...\\" He noted that, despite an effort at even- handedness, in fact Hook sided with \\"Cultural Vigilantes\\" and wound up criticizing them not for their understanding of Communism but their \\"blundering methods\\" of eradicating it from school. In 2004, Matthew J. Cotter argued appreciation for the nuance of Hook's position. Hook had recommended suspension, not removal of teachers once their Part membership become known, followed by inquiry. However, Cotter challenges Hook's \\"exaggerated sense of threat posed by Communist conspiracy among American teachers. If one accepts Hook's premise that Communist conspiracy did involve some American teachers, then Cotter deemed Hook's approach to have \\"no democratic failing.\\" Hook clearly called for a third of four steps in his process of inquiry, such that prima facie evidence of Communist Party membership should not result in automatic dismissal.\\" In this analysis, Cotter notes his own agreement with similar findings by Robert Talisse. In 2015, Edward S. Shapiro commented, \\"The bulk of Hook's writings in the 1950s, most notably Heresy, Yes‚ÄìConspiracy, No! (1953), sought to undo the damage done by McCarthyism.\\" Reconsideration by Hook In his memoir Out of Step, Hook wrote: \\"Even though I believed that membership in the [CP] rendered an individual unfit... to be a member of the teaching staff, I did not believe that the mere fact of membership should result in automatic dismissal.\\" See also * Academic freedom * Sidney Hook * McCarthyism * Anti-communism References 1953 non-fiction books Books about education Philosophy of education American political philosophy literature Contemporary philosophical literature Books about democracy Books in political philosophy Humanism Humanist literature ","title":"Heresy, Yes‚ÄìConspiracy, No"},{"id":"59141213","text":"North Dakota Highway 25 (ND 25) is a north‚Äìsouth state highway in the U.S. state of North Dakota.

She served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and as Assistant Director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. She is currently a Senior Associate at the National Institute for Public Policy in Washington, DC. She is also an artist, author, and filmmaker. Bailey was born in Dallas, Texas. She attended high school in Pana, Illinois. She earned her bachelor's degree in Asian History (1971), master's degree in Political Science (1972), and a PhD in Political Science (1976) from the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. Her doctoral thesis was a systems analysis of the National Iranian Oil Company, written after a year's research in Tehran. Career In 1976, Bailey was the first social scientist ever hired by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and was a founding member of the proliferation intelligence analysis program, which she directed from 1978-81. She specialized in analyses of foreign nuclear weapons programs. She undertook a controversial effort (ultimately squelched) to publicize a conclusion she had reached during her research in Tehran: that Iran was ripe for revolution and that it was likely to be led by the Islamic clergy. In 1981, she resigned from LLNL and founded a consultancy, International Ventures Consultants, which provided political and economic analyses on Africa to multinational companies. She produced a bi- weekly publication, Insight Africa, from 1981-83. In 1983, she accepted a political appointment from the Reagan Administration as Deputy Director for the Bureau for Research in the US Information Agency, with responsibilities for foreign public opinion polling and analysis. She was acting director from late 1983-1985. She initiated a program to highlight key reporting from leading foreign newspapers. From 1985-87, she served as Deputy Assistant Secretary in the US Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR), where she headed the Office of Disinformation, Analysis, and Response, was responsible for long-range assessments, was INR liaison with the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, and chaired the Interagency Active Measures Working Group. In the latter capacity, she revived the moribund group and edited/co-authored Active Measures: A Report on the Substance and Process of Anti-US Disinformation and Propaganda Campaigns, (US Department of State, 1986), and Soviet Influence Activities: A Report on Active Measures and Propaganda, 1986-87, (US Department of State, 1987), the latter of which revealed the Soviet role behind the accusation that the US was responsible for creating the AIDS virus as a weapon. In 1987, she was confirmed by the US Senate as Assistant Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency responsible for nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile nonproliferation policies. She initiated efforts to expand arms control dialog with China, including a bilateral meeting held in Beijing. She led the US delegation to Preparatory Committee meetings for the 1990 Review Conference for the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. She tried unsuccessfully internationalize the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, and to undertake initiatives to address Iran's budding nuclear weapons program. Following the election of President George H. W. Bush, she left the Arms Control Agency. In 1990, she taught international relations for a semester at George Mason University, where she wrote Doomsday Weapons in the Hands of Many (University of Illinois Press, 1991). Thereafter, she became a senior analyst at the National Institute for Public Policy, where she headed two major projects: one to assess the verifiability of the Chemical Weapons Convention; the other, to examine the implications of US nuclear forces moving from a triad to a dyad. In 1992, she left Washington DC to return to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to serve on the Director's Staff and was founding editor of the Director‚Äôs Series on Proliferation. She regularly testified before the US Congress on arms control issues, including the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Also, she was a guest lecturer at the NATO War College in Rome as well as at universities throughout the United States. In 1997, Bailey spoke publicly against ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. C. Bruce Tarter, then LLNL Director, ordered her to refrain from all public discussion of that treaty and other policy issues. Citing freedom of expression guidelines of the University of California (LLNL's institutional oversight body), she testified on her views before Congress and, at the request of Senator Jon Kyl (AZ), briefed several senators on the problems with the CTBT. Following retaliation measures against her at the Laboratory, Bailey retired from LLNL in 1999. She served on US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice‚Äôs Arms Control and Nonproliferation Advisory Board (2006‚Äì2008). Beginning in 1999, Bailey became a full-time artist, a profession for which she goes by her middle name, Cordelia. Although she is an oil-on-canvas painter, she is best known for her fine-art photography, which has been exhibited in galleries throughout the United States and is held in private collections. She authored and produced a feature-length film, Revenge in Kind, released in 2017. Personal life Bailey married Aman F. Amiri in 1974. They were divorced in 1981. Bailey married Robert B. Barker in 1983. She has no children. Published Works=Books= * Kathleen C. Bailey (1991). Doomsday Weapons in the Hands of Many: The Arms Control Challenge of the 90s.

He helped to establish secular portrait painting in Russia.  Biography  He studied painting with Ernst Wilhelm Londicer (1655-1697), another Baltic-German. After Londicer's death, he went to work in L√ºbeck and Riga, before returning to Reval, where he became a citizen in 1700. That same year, he joined the local artisan workshop and, shortly after, married the daughter of the municipal pharmacist. From 1698, it was his wish to be the court painter in Stockholm. Until 1719, he worked primarily in Sweden, although he also spent time in Narva and Reval. During this time, he painted the portraits of numerous Swedish noblemen, statesmen and military figures, as well as several of King Charles XII. It has been noted, however, that these portraits all show the King in the same pose, with variations in clothing and background. The original may have been done during a royal visit to Riga. In 1720, he moved to Saint Petersburg, where he painted several works commissioned by Tsar Peter, including those of the Tsar himself, the Tsarina Catherine and then-Princess Anna. His appointment as a court painter included Russian citizenship. From 1732 until his death, he taught drawing at a school for the Cadet Corps. Most of his paintings were unsigned. Many were copied, more than once, which complicates the process of verification but fifteen have, with certainty, been established as his. Others have been attributed to him based on brush technique. Approximately fifty people are said to have sat for him. The majority of his identified works are in private collections. After the October Revolution, all of his paintings held at museums in Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) were sent to provincial museums. Most critics rate his work as diligent, but mediocre. After his father-in-law died in 1731, he was tasked with overseeing the family pharmacy, which may have prevented him from giving his full attention to painting. After his death, his widow was forced to sell it.

The team, which consists of active duty and reserve personnel, was announced in November 2018 as a public outreach initiative operating within the Fort Knox, Kentucky-based Army Marketing and Engagement Team. Games in which the team announced it would compete in include Call of Duty, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Fortnite, League of Legends, Overwatch and Magic the Gathering.  History  The initiative has been accused of using internet memes and gaming to persuade people, namely younger internet users, to enlist as soldiers within the U.S. Army; it has also been criticized in its recruitment efforts for portraying both enlistment in the armed forces and experiences of serving during wartime inaccurately. Much of the criticism aimed at the Esports team arose from a tweet posted by the team's official Twitter account in response to another tweet by the official Discord Twitter account. Following negative attention aimed at the Esports team, both the official Discord server and Twitch channel run by the team became the target of trolling, as several Twitter users, in a style satirizing speedruns, jokingly competed for how fast they could be banned for posting anti-U.S. Army messages, memes, and references to war crimes committed by the United States. This led to moderators of the Discord server temporarily restricting people from joining, and a number of Twitch users being banned from the U.S. Army Esports Twitch channel. Vera Eidelman, a staff attorney at the ACLU's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, has claimed that the banning of Twitch users from the channel is a violation of the First Amendment. The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University sent a letter to the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy Recruiting Commands claiming they violated the First Amendment by banning users, and demanding an end to banning users from their Twitter accounts and Twitch channel on the basis of their viewpoints. A spokesperson for the U.S. Army responded to these allegations by denying they violated the First Amendment and stating that the banned users sent comments that were \\"meant to troll and harass the team\\". However, the team has later since announced that they would reinstate users banned for \\"harassing and degrading behavior\\". The team has also been accused of promoting fake giveaways on Twitch by providing links that they claimed would enter viewers into a giveaway for an Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, but instead merely redirected viewers to a recruitment form with no mention of the giveaway on it. Twitch asked the channel to take the links down, which the Esports channel complied with. The team admitted to a lack of transparency with the giveaways, but claimed they were still legitimate. In response to the mass criticism, the U.S. Army Esports team announced on July 22, 2020 that they would halt activity on Twitch and would likely resume activity in Spring 2021. However, the team returned to Twitch on August 14, 2020. On July 22, 2020, U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez filed a draft amendment to the House Appropriations Bill that would prohibit the U.S. Military from \\"[maintaining] a presence on Twitch or any video game, e-sports, or live-streaming platform.‚Äù This amendment has since been defeated however, with the final vote being 292-126 against it and 13 members abstaining from voting.

In 2016, Arvanitaki, Savas Dimopoulos and Ken Van Tilburg proposed a method of detecting dark matter as a matter wave, using conventional gravitational wave detectors. She has proposed using the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory to observe the gravitational waves from black hole collisions to detect the presence of QCD axions, a candidate for explaining dark matter.

The story is set in an alternate history post-Cold War universe wherein humanity has split into three warring factions, known as the Memorial Foundation, Cradle's Graces, and the Celestial Mechanics. Over the course of the game the player, through combat interactions with the other two faction pilots, can gradually push one of these three factions toward dominance over space and humanity's future. The player can follow the story by selecting one of three characters, each with her own unique backstory, personality, and faction alignment, though this alignment may change over the course of the narrative depending on player choices. Heaven Will Be Mine's gameplay is primarily text-based, with certain situations where the player can make decisions that will determine the outcome of the game.  Gameplay  A potential choice in one of the game's paths.The gameplay in Heaven Will Be Mine is focused primarily around player choice. The game is divided into 8 days wherein the player may choose from two missions, either of which will increment the \\"day\\" amount by one. The mission picked per day will not prevent the player from picking the other mission the following day, and the mission selected per day does not change the occurrences within each mission. After a mission begins, a text exchange will play between the player's chosen character and her support technician, followed by the mission itself beginning and usually an encounter with an enemy pilot. At the culmination of each mission, the player will be faced with a choice, which may involve intentionally losing a fight to win an opponent's affection or something less tangible, such as fighting with words rather than fighting with weapons. Each decision will be marked with \\"Betray\\" or \\"Loyal,\\" which will signify whether or not said decision will align with the player character's default faction. Every \\"loyal\\" decision will increment the player's alignment by 12%, and every \\"betray\\" decision will increment the player's alignment toward the enemy's faction by 25%. The player alignment can be viewed on the \\"Alignment\\" page between missions. Whichever faction the player has the most affinity with by the game's end will trigger that faction's ending.  Plot  The background of Heaven Will Be Mine begins after humanity has reached the cosmos. The Cold War, in this alternate universe, instead refers to humanity collectively coming together to combat what it believes to be a hostile alien presence referred to as an \\"Existential Threat.\\" Humanity has built a score of space- traversing fighting robots, known as Ship-Selves, to combat this threat. These machines connect to their pilots, effectively allowing their pilots to become their ships, sensing what they sense, feeling what they feel. The space program also developed a Lunar Gravity Well Generator in order for these ships, and humanity in general, to survive in the vacuum of space. Despite the initial reference to the Existential Threat as a nemesis of all humanity, the Threat is revealed to be little more than a shadow created by the gravitational presence of humanity itself, and is easily destroyed. The \\"Earth\\" faction, known as the Memorial Foundation, brands the space program a failure, and demands that the colonies of humans in space and on Mars leave their colonies and return to Earth. The Martian colonies, known as Cradle's Graces, declare independence instead, refusing to return to Earth, and a stalemate begins between them and the Memorial Foundation. While this occurs, the Celestial Mechanics faction, composed of the other space colonies, recognizes that the Memorial Foundation has branded all of those in space as mutants, which it will use as a pretense to weaponize the discontent still simmering on Earth after the initial failure to find an Existential Threat. They devise their own plan to take control of the Lunar Gravity Well and all of the space-dwelling colonies. Heaven Will Be Mine's plot, from this point, may take a number of different directions, depending on the character chosen and the arrangement of player choices afterwards. Whatever the arrangement of choices, the player's character will engage with the other two factions' pilots in combat, though this combat occurs only in text and is often interspersed by romantic feints between both pilots. Most of the choices found in each mission will allow the player to grow closer to another faction's pilot, thereby betraying their own faction in order to garner the affection of both the opposing faction and the opposing pilot. = Themes = The writing team for Heaven Will Be Mine has stated that many of the themes that appear within the game are more developed, more mature versions of the themes found in the team's prior game We Know the Devil. Such themes include social isolation, lesbianism, homophobia, transphobia, and self-actualization, among others. Most if not all of the game's themes are hidden under metaphoric symbolism.  Reception  Chris Compendio of DualShockers praised the game as \\"a great example of the uniqueness of this medium of storytelling.\\" USgamer lauded it for its \\"vibe, driven heavily by its pulsing music, UI, and art design.\\" Polygon and Wired have noted that the game's story is rather abstract and may be difficult to follow for those who do not play through it repeatedly Colin Spacetwinks for Giant Bomb nominated Heaven Will Be Mine for the number 2 spot on his list of best games of 2018, citing the \\"dreamlike drifting internal monologues\\" and the game's modern use of communication as reason for its placement. VICE Waypoint's Austin Walker gave the game a similar position on a similar list, as he praised the game's protagonists and world-building.

Unlike many members of its genus, its leaves have a few hairs on upper and lower surfaces, or lack them entirely. One of the cheilanthoid ferns, it was usually classified in the genus Cheilanthes until 2013, when the genus Myriopteris was again recognized as separate from Cheilanthes. It typically grows in shade on limestone outcrops. Description Leaf bases are closely spaced along the rhizome, which is generally in diameter. The rhizome bears persistent scales, which are linear to narrowly lance-shaped, distantly toothed,straight or slightly twisted, and loosely pressed against the surface of the rhizome. They may be uniformly brown in color, or bear a brown central stripe at the base that fades to a pale orange-brown on the rest of the rhizome. The fronds spring up in clusters; they do not unfold as fiddleheads like typical ferns (noncircinate vernation). When mature, they are long and wide. The stipe (the stalk of the leaf, below the blade) is long. It is black in color, with a covering of long, straight, matted whitish or yellowish hairs, and the upper surface is rounded. The leaf blades range in shape from lance-shaped (broadest near but not at the base) to linear with a slight widening in the upper half of the blade. The blade is usually bipinnate (cut into pinnae and pinnules) to bipinnate-pinnatifid (cut into pinnae and lobed pinnules) at the base. The rachis (leaf axis) is rounded on the upper side and dark in color. It bears twisted hairs tightly pressed to it on the upper side, and scattered, spreading, straight hairs on the lower side; no scales are present. The pinnae are not jointed at the base, and the dark pigmentation of the rachis enters the edge of the pinnae. The pinnae at the base of the leaf are slightly smaller than the pinnae immediately above them, and the pinnae are more or less symmetric about the costa (pinna axis). The upper surfaces of the pinnae have a few soft hairs, or none at all. The upper sides of the costae are green for most of their length and lack scales beneath. The pinnules are elliptical to long-triangular, and not bead-shaped as in some other species of Myriopteris. The largest pinnules are long, and have sparse white hairs on upper and lower surfaces, or lack hairs entirely. On fertile fronds, the sori are protected by false indusia formed by the edge of the leaf curling back over the underside. The false indusia are somewhat differentiated from the rest of the leaf tissue, and are 0.1‚Äì0.4 mm wide. Beneath them, the sori are generally continuous around the edges of the fertile pinnules. Each sporangium in a sorus carries 32 spores. Most individual sporophytes are apogamous triploids, with a chromosome number of 3n = 87. Sexual diploids with 2n = 58 are known from Nuevo Leon, Mexico. Taxonomy The common name \\"lip fern\\" comes from the position of the sporangia at the edge or lip of the leaf, typical of the genus. The species was first described in 1843 by Samuel Botsford Buckley, based on material collected from limestone rocks on the banks of the Tennessee River at the foot of Muscle Shoals, Alabama. He named it Pteris alabamensis, for the location where it was collected, also giving rise to the common name. In 1847, Gustav Kunze (who had grown the plant from spore, provided by Ferdinand Rugel) transferred the species to the genus Cheilanthes as C. alabamensis. William Jackson Hooker & John Gilbert Baker, in their second edition of Synopsis Filicum (1874), separated the genera Cheilanthes and Pellaea based on the character of the false indusium, placing species with a continuous indusium into Pellaea; accordingly, Baker renamed the species Pellaea alabamensis. However, American manuals did not generally follow this rather artificial distinction; the Illustrated Flora of Britton and Brown (1896) and the 7th edition of Gray's Manual (1908) both refer to it as C. alabamensis, the name under which the species was generally known during the 20th Century. Nor did they generally accept George Edward Davenport's 1894 demotion of the species to a variety of the very similar Cheilanthes microphylla as C. microphylla var. alabamensis. As part of his wide-ranging program of taxonomic revision, Otto Kuntze argued that the principle of priority precluded the use of the generic name Pellaea, and transferred the species to the older genus Allosorus in 1891. Oliver Atkins Farwell, on similar grounds, argued for the priority of Allosorus over Cheilanthes and accidentally duplicated Kuntze's combination in 1920. These combinations were rendered unnecessary when Pellaea and Cheilanthes were conserved over Allosorus in the Paris Code published in 1956. The development of molecular phylogenetic methods showed that the traditional circumscription of Cheilanthes is polyphyletic. Convergent evolution in arid environments is thought to be responsible for widespread homoplasy in the morphological characters traditionally used to classify it and the segregate genera that have sometimes been recognized. On the basis of molecular evidence, Amanda Grusz and Michael D. Windham revived the genus Myriopteris in 2013 for a group of species formerly placed in Cheilanthes. One of these was C. alabamensis, which thus became Myriopteris alabamensis. In 2018, Maarten J. M. Christenhusz transferred the species to Hemionitis as H. alabamensis, as part of a program to consolidate the cheilanthoid ferns into that genus. Further molecular studies in Myriopteris demonstrated the existence of three well-supported clades within the genus. M. alabamensis is deeply nested in one of them, informally named the alabamensis clade by Grusz et al. Distribution and habitat Within the United States, M. alabamensis is found in the southern Appalachian Mountains from Virginia and North Carolina south, in the Ozarks, along the southern border of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, and in a few isolated stations in the Mississippi Valley and on the east coast of Florida. In Mexico, it is present in the northern states bordering the United States (except Baja California) and south through central Mexico to Oaxaca. Myriopteris alabamensis typically grows on limestone cliffs and ledges, or on the ground on shell mounds or among limestone rocks. It prefers shady habitat. It has been found at altitudes from . Ecology and conservation While globally secure (G4G5), M. alabamensis is threatened in many states in the northern and eastern part of its range. It has become extinct in Louisiana, and is only known historically from Kentucky. NatureServe considers it to be critically imperiled in Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Virginia, imperiled in Georgia, and vulnerable in Alabama. Cultivation Myriopteris alabamensis can be cultivated, and should be grown under medium-high light in alkaline garden soil and sand. The soil should be dry to slightly moist.

Alumil S.A. is considered one of the largest industries in extrusion of aluminum, followed by Exalco S.A., Europa S.A., Elvial S.A., Etem S.A., and Aluminco S.A. The company is specialized in the research, development and production of aluminium architectural systems. The company is headquartered in the Industrial Area of Stavrochori Kilkis, Greece and has more than 2,000 employees. Alumil S.A. operates worldwide with over 30 subsidiaries. It is listed on Athens Exchange Market. History In 1988, the Milonas family created an industrial company for the design, production and commercialization of aluminium profiles, in the Industrial Area of Kilkis in Northern Greece. During the 90's the company presented its first systems which were produced in Italy. In the following years, it started its own vertically integrated production line, and in 1993 it founded its commercial subsidiary Alusys in Athens, as well as a Research and Development department at its facilities in Kilkis in order to design new products. Subsequently, the company expanded its operations abroad, establishing subsidiaries in Romania in 1997, Hungary, Albania and Bulgaria in 1998, Poland and Ukraine in 1999. The following years additional subsidiaries were founded, in Germany, North Macedonia and Cyprus during 2000, as well as in Serbia and Italy during 2001. Moreover, in 2001, the subsidiary Metron S.A. specialized in elevators was created through acquisition of a company which was specialized in the production of automatic doors. In order to strengthen the Group's domestic market share, two exhibition venues in Athens and Thessaloniki have been set up and exclusive product representation with Phifer Inc., ASA and GU has been agreed. In 2004, it acquired Alpro, a Bosnian aluminum industry. In addition, the Group received significant distinctions such as Europe's GrowthPlus Top 500 award and the \\"Export Activity Award\\" of Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In 2007, a subsidiary was established in the United Arab Emirates so as to enhance the company's presence at the Arabian peninsula. In 2008 a subsidiary in the United States of America was established. During the same period, due to Greek financial crisis the Group set priority on international markets. In 2009, a Greek subsidiary, Alumil Solar was founded, a company which specialized in the design, production and commercialization of photovoltaic mounting systems. In 2010, it founded a subsidiary based in Russia. In 2014, a certification labaratory-testing centre was set up in collaboration with CFT and the ift Rosenheim Institute. Last but not least, in 2015 Alumil announced the establishment of three more subsidiaries in Australia, India and Egypt.  Social and environmental action  Offices in Thessaloniki In accordance with Corporate Social Responsibility, from 2010 Alumil started implementing the environmental plan ‚Äò‚ÄôGreen Alumil‚Äô‚Äô. More important was the distinction of the Group‚Äôs Innovation and Contribution in Environmental Awareness, which awarded on the Eco-Business Innovation Competition during the 4th Business Forum of the 73rd Thessaloniki International Fair. Alumil is also a member of the Hellenic Network for Corporate Social Responsibility and a founding member of the United Nations Global Compact Network.  Subsidiaries  In 2000 Alumil started its activity in Renewable Energy Resources by producing and placing photovoltaic mounting systems. Subsequently, Alumil Solar was founded nine years later (2009), and developed into a high importance and innovative business unit of the group.  Awards and distinctions  Alumil has received several awards and distinctions. The most important was the registration as an associate member of the European Union of Aluminium in 2008. ;2016: Alumil was recognized as one of the most powerful and valuable brands in the category of construction materials by Superbrands Greece ;2015: First Prize \\"Made in Greece 2015\\" in the category \\"Industrial Excellence\\" and First Prize in \\"Hellenic Value 2015\\" in the category \\"Technological Excellence\\" ;2011: Best Helexpo Award ;2010: Award from ICAP Group as True Leader ;2009: Award from the ‚ÄúTrade & Investment Leaders Awards by Helexpo‚Äù during the 74th Thessaloniki International Exhibition in September 2009 and from the 5th Business Forum regarding with the: \\"Foreign Direct Investment Seize the Opportunities of the Era\\" ;2008: Distinction as Associate Member of the European Union Aluminum ;2008: Award for Photovoltaic Window Systems during the Eco-Entrepreneurship and Innovation Competition ;2007: Sales Excellence Awards from the Hellenic Institute of Sales ;2004: Distinction from Great Place to Work -Europe ;1996/1998/2001/2002/2003/2004/2005/2007: Awards from International Growth Plus ;1999/2001/2003/2004: Awards from the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) ReferencesExternal links On Reuters *Ift Rosenheim. *United Nations Global Compact Kilkis Greek brands Companies based in Kilkis Manufacturing companies established in 1988 Aluminium companies of Greece Companies listed on the Athens Exchange Greek companies established in 1988 ","title":"Alumil Aluminium Industry S.A."},{"id":"59141777","text":"In The Cupboard is a Nigerian drama movie featuring most top acts.

Biography  Forssell was born at Sala in V√§stmanland County, Sweden. He was born out of wedlock to Beata Forssell, the daughter of a local miller. His father was generally believed to be a silver miner. He attended school in Sala from 1855 to 1861 and apparently had some art lessons during that time. In 1865, he was accepted as a student at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts. There, he studied with the landscape painters Edward Bergh and Per Daniel Holm. In 1877, unable to obtain a scholarship, he set off on a study trip at his own expense, beginning with D√ºsseldorf followed by Paris, London and Antwerp.

Michael Imhof Verlag, Petersberg 2011, , Band 1, S. 430 After returning home, he continued to travel, spending several summers on the island of Gotland with his friend and fellow landscape painter, Per Ekstr√∂m. In 1887, he became a member of the Royal Academy. In the 1890s, he undertook a lengthy visit to Denmark, Norway and England. His mother, with whom he had been living, died in 1897. Seeking spiritual solace, he turned to the teachings of Helena Blavatsky and embraced the pantheistic worldview of Theosophy, which influenced his approach to his choice of subjects for painting. In 1902, he was awarded a contract by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to teach painting animals in a landscape (djurplacering i landskapen). The class was taught outdoors in several locations around Stockholm. By 1912, the money he had saved enabled him to buy a small estate, Stora Sickla g√•rd, at Sickla√∂ parish in Nacka. After the chaos of World War I had settled, he found himself virtually forgotten. Sometime in the early 1920s, he suffered a serious fall which left him unable to walk without crutches. He was eventually awarded a disability pension by the Academy and moved to Solsunda sanatorium at Skurusundet in Nacka municipality where he died in 1931, aged eighty-five.

It is a rare surviving example of an English bronze jug from the 14th century, with great significance for the study of bronze working in medieval England. It was taken from Kumasi in Asante (now Ghana) during the Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War in 1895, and since 1896 has been held by the British Museum in London. Description The front of the Asante Jug is decorated with the Royal Arms of England from the late 14th century, surmounted by a crown, with two lion supporters. Above three lines of lettering in a Lombardic script, within a moulded band, read from the bottom: : \\"+ HE THAT WYL NOT SPARE WHEN HE MAY HE SHALL NOT / SPEND WHEN HE WOULD DEME THE BEST IN EVERY / DOWT TIL THE TROWTHE BE TRYID OWTE\\" The inscription appears to be two English sentences, run together: : \\"He that will not spare when he may he shall not spend when he would\\" and \\"Deem the best in every doubt until the truth be tried out\\". The neck of the Asante Jug bears six roundels, three on either side, each with a falcon spreading its wings, with one to each side of the spout and two either side of the handle. On the lip are three lions facing left, and a stag in a circle facing right. The seven-sided lid of the jug is original, decorated with a lion above a stag couchant in each segment. The handle ends with a scrolled quatrefoil. Without the lid, the jug is high, and the lid (including the overlapping underlip) is . When assembled with its lid, the jug is high. It weighs , and has a capacity of . When filled, it would be inconveniently heavy to use. Similar jugs Only two similar jugs are known in the UK. All have similar shapes, bear inscriptions in English with similar lettering, and were made from leaded bronze, an alloy of copper, tin and lead, cast in a two-part mould in a similar manner using bronze spacers to separate the inner and outer moulds, with similar heraldic decorative motifs. The Asante jug is the largest, and the only one to retain its lid. Of the other two jugs, the smallest is Wenlok jug in Luton: it was sold by Alexander Fermor-Hesketh, 3rd Baron Hesketh in 2005. The third is the Robinson jug, which was found in a farmhouse in Norfolk in the 1879 and is now in the collection of the Victoria & Albert Museum. The other two have fittings for a hinged lid but the lid has not survived. All three jugs were made in England. The heraldic emblems on this jug link it to either Edward III or Richard II. The stag badges on the lid suggest Richard II, who used the white stag in the 1390s. The jug was found in Manhyia Palace in Kumasi in 1895, but when and how it arrived in West Africa is not known. It is speculated that it was carried from Europe to Africa in the Early Modern period as an impressive gift to present to an African ruler, having been bought cheaply there. There is a photograph taken in 1887 which shows the jug under a sacred tree at the royal palace. Another plainer 14th century English lidded jug is in Leeds City Museum. History The jug was bought by the British Museum in 1896 from Major General Charles St Leger Barter, who served in the Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War in December 1895 to February 1896 (also known as the Second Ashanti Expedition) which reached Kumasi and depose the Asantehene Prempeh I.

His brother Guillaume was bishop of Noyon (1331-1338), bishop of Bayeux (1338-1347) and bishop of Beauvais (1347-1356). In 1285, Robert went on crusade to Aragon, as a squire to his uncle Clermont de Nesle, following the massacres of the Sicilian Vespers in 1282. The French army led by King Philip III of France entered Italy, while another smaller army provided a diversion in Spain. Figueras, Castillon and Girona were taken. It is reported that during the battle of Girona in September 1285, Robert seriously wounded King Peter III of Aragon, who died soon afterwards of the wounds. In 1321, Robert Bertrand was sent on mission in Lorraine to the bishop of Verdun and Luxembourg, regarding the bishopric of Verdun. A dispute had broken out between Edward I of Bar and John I of Bohemia, resulting in a war between the two protagonists. The mediation resulted in a short-lived truce. During August 1322, Robert accompanied his father-in-law Henri de Sully and other French knights into the service of King Edward II of England. They fought for England against King Robert I of Scotland. During the decisive meeting at the Battle of Old Byland on 14 October 1322 in Yorkshire, near Byland Abbey, the French knights remained on the battlefield after the English were defeated and were made prisoners. On 30 May 1323, a truce was signed between Edward II and Robert I, with a ransom being paid for the release of the French prisoners and on 3 June 1324, Bertrand and the surviving French knights embarked at Dover to return to France. In 1325, Bertrand was appointed Marshal of France by King Charles IV of France. Bertrand was dispatched in 1325-1326 to Flanders to calm a peasant rebellion. In 1327, Robert went to the Agenais and the Bordelais to pacify these two regions. In 1328, the Marshal returned to Flanders following a new revolt of the Flemish, this time accompanied by the new King Philip VI of France. The Flemish rebels commanded by Nicolaas Zannekin were annihilated by the French royal army at the Battle of Cassel. In 1336, he became a member of the Council of the King in Paris, witnessing and signing a treaty of alliance with King Alfonso XI of Castile. Following the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War between France and England, Bertrand was ordered to occupy the island of Guernsey from the English. Robert was appointed as Lord of Guernsey, a position he held until Guernsey was recaptured by the English in July 1345. He took part in the defense of Tournai in 1339. In 1341, the War of Succession of Brittany broke out with Charles de Blois, Duke of Brittany requesting help. Philip VI, Charles' uncle, sent a French army including Bertrand to Brittany. Robert resigned his office as Marshall of France in March 1344, aged 71, remaining a member of the King's Council. The English under King Edward III of England landed in Normandy on 12 July 1346, at Saint- Vaast-la-Hougue. Bertrand, with his eldest son Robert IX and 300 men vainly tried to prevent the landing. Robert was injured along with his son and had to retire with only 30 survivors of his troop. The English army marched to Caen, where Bertand had sought refuge with his brother Guillaume, Governor of the Chateau of Caen. The English looted and sacked Caen, with the city burned, 95 French knights and Norman prisoners and 2,500 dead. The castle held out and after the main English army left, the castle defenders sallied out and defeated the English occupying force. He was nicknamed \\"The Green Lion Knight\\", after his coat of arms. He died in 1348 and was buried in the Saint- Sauveur Church of Beaumont-en-Auge.

It comprises a bronze sculpture by Henry Poole which depicts the British fighter pilot Captain Albert Ball VC DSO & Two Bars, MC accompanied by an allegorical female figure, standing on a stone pedestal by the architect Edwin Alfred Rickards. The memorial was unveiled in 1921, was listed at Grade II in 1972, upgraded to Grade I in 2017. Background Albert Ball was born in Nottingham in 1896. His father, also Albert Ball, was a businessman and local politician. In September 1914, soon after the outbreak of the First World War, Ball enlisted in the 2/7th (Robin Hood) Battalion of the Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment) and he was quickly commissioned as a second lieutenant. After some private flying tuition, he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps and qualified as a pilot in January 1916. He flew reconnaissance missions in France from February 1916 with No. 13 Squadron. He moved to a fighter unit, No. 11 Squadron, in May 1916 and soon recorded his first aerial victory. Within 12 months, he achieved 44 confirmed \\"kills\\", and a further 25 unconfirmed. Ball became famous for his martial achievements, and he was described by Germany aviator Manfred von Richthofen (the \\"Red Baron\\") as \\"by far the best English flying man\\". He was promoted to acting captain in August 1916, and moved to No. 60 Squadron. He was formally recognised by the award of the Military Cross, and the Distinguished Service Order with two Bars. Ball was killed when his aircraft crashed on 7 May 1917. A month later, he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Ball was also created a Chevalier of the French L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur, and the Russian Order of St George (4th Class). Ball was buried in the communal cemetery at Ann≈ìullin in France. His father bought the field where his aircraft crashed and erected a separate memorial there. Design The bronze memorial statue by Henry Poole stands in the grounds of the Grade I listed Nottingham Castle, amidst a number of other Grade I listed buildings and structures. Also nearby are a Grade II listed war memorial sundial, and a Grade II listed war memorial obelisk. The memorial was commissioned by Nottingham City Council and funded by public subscription. It includes a life- size statue of Ball, depicted in a standing position, wearing in his flying uniform, with his hands on his belt, looking up towards the sky. Behind him stands an robed woman standing on clouds: this allegorical figure representing \\"Air\\" is resting one hand on Ball's shoulder and pointing upwards with the other hand. The composition draws on Christian depictions of the raising of saints, drawn upwards towards heaven. Plinth inscription The sculpture stands on a Portland stone plinth, designed by the architect Edwin Alfred Rickards, two sides of which have relief carvings depicting an S.E.5a biplane, one flying over trenches and the other flying above clouds. The other two sides bear inscriptions within cartouches. Each inscription includes a reference to the motto of the nascent RAF, \\"Per ardua ad astra\\" (\\"By labour to the stars\\"). One inscription reads: \\"CAPT. ALBERT BALL V.C. / 7TH ROBIN HOOD BATTALION SHERWOOD FORESTERS / ATTACHED ROYAL FLYING CORPS, DSO (2 BARS) MC / CROIX DE CHEVALIER, LEGION D'HONNEUR, / ORDER OF ST GEORGE (RUSSIAN) / HON. FREEMAN OF THE CITY OF NOTTINGHAM / PER ARDUA AD ASTRA\\". And the other inscription reads \\"IN THE AIR / HE GAVE MOST CONSPICUOUS / AND GALLANT SERVICE TO / HIS COUNTRY AND WAS KILLED / IN ACTION FIGHTING GLORIOUSLY / MAY 7TH 1917 AGED 20 YEARS / PER ARDUA AD ASTRA\\". The plinth rests on a tiered grey granite base, with three lobed steps. The base has bronze fittings, including eternal flames, a feather, a laurel wreath, and architectural feet. The memorial was unveiled by Air Marshal Sir Hugh Trenchard on 8 September 1921. Trenchard had served as commander of the Royal Flying Corps in France from August 1915 to January 1918, and then Chief of the Air Staff. The ceremony included a flypast by a squadron of RAF aircraft.

Life and legal career  Born in London, Mathew was the elder son of the Irish-born judge Sir James Charles Mathew and Elizabeth, n√©e Biron, the daughter of a vicar. His great-uncle and namesake was the Irish temperance campaigner Father Theobald Mathew. His younger brother was the barrister and Labour MP Charles Mathew, while his sister Elizabeth was the wife of Irish Nationalist MP John Dillon. He was the uncle of Director of Public Prosecutions Sir Theobald Mathew and of Irish politician James Dillon. Mathew was educated at The Oratory School and Trinity College, Oxford, where he obtained second-class honours in History in 1888. Like his father and brother, he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1890, and practiced in the chambers of Joseph Walton, later a High Court judge. In 1896, Mathew became the editor of Commercial Cases, a series of law reports on the Commercial Court, which his father had helped to create, and in 1902, he published Practice of the Commercial Court. Mathew had a large practice at the common law bar; after the First World War he frequently appeared in Canadian appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. In his later years he became a libel specialist. He was Recorder of Margate from 1913 to 1927 and Recorder of Maidstone from 1927 to 1936. Like his father, Mathew never took silk, but remained a junior at the common law bar until his seventies. He was elected a bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1916. At the time of his death he has been scheduled to serve as treasurer of the Inn. Mathew was a popular pupil master: among his pupils at 4 Paper Buildings were the future prime minister Clement Attlee (whose father was a friend of Mathew), Sir Stafford Cripps, Quintin Hogg, and Peter Thorneycroft.  As a legal humourist  Mathew's fame among his contemporaries chiefly rests on his reputation as one of the greatest wits of his day. From 1925, writing under the pseudonym \\"O\\", he began to contribute a weekly series of \\"Forensic Fables\\" to the Law Journal, which he illustrated himself. The Fables mocked many leading legal personalities of the day, under thin disguise. These were subsequently published in four volumes between 1926 and 1932. In 1937, he published For Lawyers and Others, which brought his work to a broader audience. He was also famous for his spontaneous witticisms. On one occasion, Mathew, upon meeting a white friend in the library of an Inn of Court which had many African members, greeted him with \\"Dr. Livingstone, I presume\\", a remark which was said to have \\"acquired legendary status during his lifetime\\".  Family  In 1898, he married Ruth, daughter of the Rev George Henry Rigby and niece of the judge Sir John Rigby; they had five sons and two daughters.

Portinari was a patron of Hugo van der Goes, who painted the Portinari Altarpiece, and also of Hans Memling.

Tommaso represented the Medici bank in Bruges, but after a promising early career made a number of risky, unsecured loans to Charles the Bold which eventually led to the branch's insolvency. The couple returned to Florence in 1497, but Tommaso died young. Description The work is a three-quarter half-length portrait of Portinari, who is turned to his right, and set against a dark background. He wears a black cape, from which the collar and sleeves of a dark robe protrude, typical garments of the upper middle class of the time. His hands are clasped as if praying, with his elbows resting on a parapet at or just below the lower edge of the frame. Underdrawing shows that Memling changed the position of Tommaso's hands to make them less vertical. Speculative reconstruction of the triptych Tommaso's son Francesco Portinari bequeathed the work to Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in 1544, when it was described as \\"unum tabernaculettum que clauditur with tribus sportellis, in this est depicta imago Gloriossime virginis Marie et patris et matris dicti testatoris\\" (\\"a small tabernacle with three hinged panels, in which are painted the images of the most glorious Virgin Mary and of the testator's father and mother\\"). It remained at the Hospital until the Napoleonic times, and was later in the Demidoff collection. It is not clear when the central panel was separated from its two wings. The Tommaso and Maria Portinari panels were sold, with an attribution to Dieric Bouts, in 1870 for 6,000 francs. They were acquired in Rome c.1900 by , then in 1901 passed through the hands of Thomas Agnew & Sons in London and to L√©opold Goldschmidt in Paris. They were included in the important Primitifs flamands exhibition in Bruges in 1902. In 1910 the panels was sold by Kleinberger to Benjamin Altman for $426,500; he left them to the Metropolitan Museum of Art on his death in 1913. NotesSources * Ainsworth, Maryan.

This 2,100 page diary was first published in 1889 and sheds light on daily life in Philadelphia, the Society of Friends, family and gender roles, political issues and the American Revolution, and innovations in medical practices. Personal life Elizabeth Drinker was born on February 27, 1735, to William and Sarah Sandwith. A young merchant, Henry Drinker, courted her, and they married on January 13, 1761. Both Elizabeth and Henry were members of the Society of Friends. Elizabeth functioned as a housewife while Henry Drinker was a partner of the James & Drinker shipping and importing firm in Philadelphia. Elizabeth and Henry had five children who all survived to adulthood: Sarah, Ann, William, Henry, and Mary. Her affluence, due to her husband's employment, and her own education allowed her the literacy and leisure time to keep a diary of her life for 50 years. Elizabeth and Henry wrote often to one another while Henry was kept prisoner at Masonic Lodge, as many fellow Quakers were for their pacifist beliefs during the American Revolutionary War. From her journal entries and the 67 letters between them, it is evident that Henry encouraged Elizabeth to do as she saw fit to continue running the house in his absence. The letters suggest that the couple had a companionate marriage, a resembling a partnership more than a patriarchal structure. In order to get through the seven months of Henry's absence, Elizabeth relied on her domestic skills, support from friends and family, and her religious beliefs. Elizabeth was the primary caregiver for her children, especially for her son William, who struggled with chronic illness. In addition, Mary Sandwith, Elizabeth's sister, lived with them for most of her life. Elizabeth often depended on servants to run her household. She discussed this in her diary and highlighted the changes in domestic service during her lifetime, including the beginnings of domestic service as a waged occupation for women. Though Henry and Elizabeth had a generally happy marriage, she was often frustrated with how often he left the family for work, as even after the children were adults and they were in their old age, he continued to work as a merchant. Elizabeth Drinker died on November 24, 1807; Henry lived for another two years after. The diary Elizabeth Sandwith Drinker kept her diary 1758 to 1807. Its published version is broken down into four parts: Youth and courtship (1755‚Äì61), Young wife and mother (1762‚Äì75), Middle age in years of crisis (1776‚Äì93), and Grandmother (1794‚Äì1807). Her diary begins with an emphasis on her youth and social life and ends with a focus on her eventual station as a matriarch of a Quaker household and member of the Quaker upper- class. Her initial entries centered around her relationship with her sister and husband. However, once she became a mother, her entries primarily revolved around her maternal duties. Her entries regarding her husband, and particularly his absences, also shed light on the gender roles within Quaker society, as she was often left in charge of the household and home. Especially during the 1790s, Drinker also wrote extensively regarding her Federalist views, as she and other women of the time became engaged in politics. She lived during a time of political struggle between the Federalists and the Democratic Republicans. She paid attention to the Pamphlet wars in her entries but mainly focused on Federalist ideas. She expressed opinions regarding the political violence of the time and her thoughts regarding the election process. She also commented on the French Revolution. Her entries regarding Henry's arrest and time in prison, also shed light on the Quakers and their experience of the American Revolutionary War. In addition to the political and social views in the diary, Drinker described changing medical practices during the 18th century. She chronicled the development of smallpox inoculation and vaccination. She noted, \\"I wrote to Molly to endeavor to persuade her to have her children vaccinated instead of inoculated, for small pox.\\" She also addressed the spread of Yellow fever. She additionally kept records detailing her own family's health and medical preferences.

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2003. Overview The Miyahata ruins contains the overlapping ruins of a settlement from existed from the middle J≈çmon period (4500‚Äì4000 years ago), late J≈çmon period (4000‚Äì3000 years ago) to the final J≈çmon period (3000‚Äì2500 years ago). It is located on the left bank of the Abukuma River, on a river terrace with an altitude of about 60 meters. From 1997, several rescue archaeology excavations were made during the construction of the nearby Fukushima Industrial Park, revealing many remains, including the ruins of a burnt-down dwelling house from the middle J≈çmon period and other dwellings from the late J≈çmon period. As a result of a survey conducted from 1998, it became protected from development as a National Historic Site. The middle J≈çmon period ruins consist of over 40 pit dwellings, of which over half appear to have been destroyed at the same time in a fire. The late J≈çmon period ruins consist of pit dwellings with stone cobblestone floors in a style more often found the in Kant≈ç region of Japan. Pottery fragments also consistent with the Kant≈ç region, including some pottery burial jars were also uncovered. As these ruins are not contiguous with in time with the middle J≈çmon period ruins, it appears that the village was abandoned after its conflagration, and resettled by migrants from another region of Japan. The final J≈çmon period ruins consist of raised floor buildings arranged unevenly around a roughly square plaza measuring 45 meters east-west by 60 meters north-south. One of the buildings was a rectangular structure with gigantic columns with a diameter of 90-cm, which is presumed to have been used for some ritual purpose. Earthenware and stoneware were excavated in large quantities, and many religious relics such as clay figurines. The site is open to the public as an archaeological park with several reconstructed buildings and a museum. It is located approximately 10 minutes by car from Senoue Station on the Abukuma Express Line.

Santos founded and led the Lapiang Malaya, a political movement that opposed the government of Ferdinand Marcos.  Biography  Valentin de los Santos was born on the Filipino island of Luzon in the early 20th century. In the 1940s, Santos began a Christianity-based political movement in Northern Luzon advocating for more economic and social equality.GOROSPE, V. (1970). Christian Koinonia and Some Philippine Cultural Forces. Philippine Studies, 18(1), 52-82 Many people were drawn to Santos' style of leadership, which involved him teaching new methods of prayer to people. As noted by one source, Santos taught his followers a \\"beautiful way\\" in which to pray and interact positively with others; this was in contrast to other Filipino priests, who focused more on preaching and community functions. Santos' messages also revolved around nonviolence, equality, and nationalism, political credos which helped the Lapiang Malaya garner support among the poorer peoples of Luzon. The party supported Santos when he ran for president in the Philippine presidential election of 1957. In addition to being the leader of the Lapiang Malaya, Santos became renowned in Luzon for his charisma. He was also purported to have healing abilities, superhuman strength, and invulnerability to bullets; some of these beliefs were shared by other members of the Lapiang Malaya. Santos was also believed by his followers to have invented a number of inventions, including the traffic light. In the Spring of 1967, Santos and the Lapiang Malaya organized a political rally in the Philippine capital of Manila, where they intended to peacefully overthrow the government of Ferdinand Marcos. The organization marched on Malaca√±ang Palace on 20 May, but were intercepted by the Philippine Constabulary. The crowd was eventually dispersed with force, resulting in the deaths of 33 people, after which Santos was arrested. He was judged to be insane by the Filipino government and confined to the National Center for Mental Health, where he was eventually killed by another patient. Following his incarceration and death, his son-in- law, Domingo De Guia, replaced him as the head of Lapiang Malaya.

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2006. Overview The Wadai ruins date from the middle J≈çmon period (4500‚Äì4000 years ago), and are located on an elevated plateau with an altitude of 195 meters, in the former town of Iino, Fukushima, sandwiched between the Abukuma River and the Megami River. The site was excavated during construction work on the Fukushima Prefectural Route No. 39 highway, but after the survey was competed, the highway was rerouted to a tunnel in order to protect the ruins. The site was found to contain the ruins of over 230 pit dwellings and stilt-pillar buildings surrounding circular plaza, making it one of the largest J≈çmon settlement sites to have been discovered in Fukushima. Most of the pit dwelling had storage pits, but numerous grave pits were also found. Numerous pottery fragments have been discovered including an earthenware statue of a human body (head, body, limbs) and pottery with textile patterns and containing hunting scenes. Anthropomorphic J≈çmon pottery was common in far northern Japan and Hokkaido, but had never been found so far south before this find. Daily utensils made from bone, stone and animal horn have been uncovered, as well as artifacts made from obsidian and oceanic fish bones from the Kant≈ç, Hokuriku and Ch≈´bu regions, indicating long distance trade in the J≈çmon period. The settlement appears to have been inhabited for approximately 200 years, but then was abandoned for unknown reasons. Another mystery about the site is that although pottery shards were very numerous, there was no trace of any clay mining or pottery firing. The site was backfilled after excavation, and is marked with a stone monument. It is located about 16 minutes by car from Matsukawa Station on the JR East T≈çhoku Main Line.

It was published on „ÄäChosunjoongangilbo (Hanja: ÊúùÈÆÆ‰∏≠Â§ÆÊó•Â†±)„Äã from July 24, 1934 to August 8. The poem was originally planned as 30 series, but Yi Sang could only publish 15 because many readers sent letters that the poetry is too hard to understand. It is impossible to grasp the specific meaning of poetry, and only anxiety, fear, and confusion are vaguely conveyed to readers in the overall feeling of poetry.  Origin of title  A bird's eye view is an elevated view of an object from above, with a perspective as though the observer were a bird. The poet replaced È≥• (which means bird) to ÁÉè (which means crow) as the title. The general view of the meaning of the title is that these titles are intentional expressions to reveal anxiety. The word crow, which traditionally means misfortune, also makes the atmosphere of this poem reluctant. There is also an anecdote about this title. Since the word 'ÁÉèÁû∞Âúñ' (Crow's Eye View) doesn't exist in Korean dictionary, printing press kept asking that if the title was a typo of 'È≥•Áû∞Âúñ' (bird's eye view).  Poem No.1 = English Version = Click Here for English Version. = Analysis = It is noticeable that the poem is not spaced at all. Since Korean is a spoken language, spacing is the most basic rule of speech. When not spaced, it is not only confusing to read but also difficult to grasp the meaning. Violating the basic code of such grammar implies the poet's rebellion and disobedience to the symbolic power of the world, and the desire for aesthetic freedom. Usually, in the 1930s of Korea (which was Japanese occupation period), people would have had to live in despair wherever they went. Also, Yi Sang was suffering from lung disease, so he always had threats of death. The thirteen people who lost their sense of life and direction are self-portraits of his nation and their own image. This poem expresses fear, frustration, and faint hope of the colonial poet who had to live in a heartbreaking period of anxiety and fear in the paradoxical situation of 'dead end' and 'open end'. There are various analysis of the '13' children. One of the most common analysis of the number is that it represents the 13 people at the Last Supper. The part where it says '13Childrenwerejustgatheredtogetherlikethataseitherfrighteningorfrightenedchildren (TheabsenceofanyotherConditionwerehighlypreferable)' shows the anxiety of Judas, who is destined to betray Jesus and the anxiety of other apostles who doesn't know who the betrayer is.  Poem No.4 = Analysis = The common analysis of this poem is that the numbers symbolize geometric sequence. The sequence always converges to zero, which symbolizes death. Also, it can be related with his tuberculosis that he was suffering from. The problem relating to this poem was presented on College Scholastic Ability Test (South Korea) 2003.

The main critic of Alexandre Dumas, he contributed novels, short stories and biographies to the French literary life of the second half of the 19th century.  Life  Born in Mirecourt, Vosges, Jacquot was the son of Nicolas Jacquot and Marie-Jos√©phine Petit-Jean. He studied for the priesthood at a seminary, but left it to pursue literature. After having worked for some time as a pension master in Chartres,Necrology published in the Journal de Chartres of 21 March 1880, page 2. he began working as a journalist, using the pen name Eug√®ne de Mirecourt. After some short stories, he published, together with Leupol, a three-volume work, \\"la Lorraine\\" (Nancy, 1839‚Äì1840), which gave his name a certain notoriety. It was then that he began to publicize the many collaborations that Alexandre Dumas had used in the series of novels published under that name. In his pamphlet Fabrique de Romans: Maison Alexandre Dumas & Cie, fabrique de romans (1845), Mirecourt denounced the fact that Dumas' work was written by others and thus contributed to the spread of a figurative meaning of the word n√®gre (ghostwriter in French). Because he used abusive, devaluing and deliberately racist language about Dumas' appearance, smell, morals and \\"black\\" nature, the latter filed a complaint. Mirecourt was sentenced to six months in prison and a fine.Cf. Sylvain Ledda, Alexandre Dumas, Folio ‚Äì √âditions Gallimard, 2014, ; Eug√®ne de Mirecourt, Fabrique de romans. Maison A.

Among the hundred contemporaries portrayedLes contemporains / par Eug√®ne de Mirecourt. hathitrust.org were Hector BerliozBerlioz French National Library and George Sand.George Sand French National Library After the Gallerie finished in 1857, Mirecourt founded the weekly Les Contemporains. In this serial, each issue contained a biographical article penned in his typically biting style. It resulted in fierce disputes and many trials in which the courts judged him severely. His term Contemporains was used by other journalists. At the end of his life, he entered the Dominicans of Plo√´rmel, became a priest, and was sent to teach in Tahiti, where he died at the age of 67.  Works  Works by Mirecourt are held by the French National Library.

The station covers a total area of 250,000 square feet. Design The Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation (now Mahametro) launched a global competition on 5 June 2015 inviting bids for the Sitaburdi and Zero Mile metro stations. Twenty-three architecture firms submitted designs in response. The metro authority shortlisted 13 firms for the detailed design stage, and eventually requested four firms to submit designs. A panel of architects appointed by the authority to pick the winning design, and the preliminary design of the winning entry was unveiled by the metro authority in May 2016. The station was designed by a consortium of architects comprising Enia Architects, Mahendra Raj Consultants and Worxpace Consulting. The building's facade is made of locally sourced glass and stone. The station is a T-shaped building. A three-storey building is located at the center of the \\"T\\" and six-storey building on of its arms facing Rani Jhansi Square.

Personal life  James Haughton was born in October 1929 in Brooklyn, New York to James Haughton Sr. and Mary Miller, both immigrants from the West Indies. Haughton received a BSS from the City College of New York in 1951 and an MPA from New York University in 1960. From 1951 to 1953 Haughton fought in the Korean War as a US Army lieutenant. Following his military service, Haughton worked with gang members in Los Angeles and New York City as a youth counselor and social worker. Haughton married prominent anthropologist, social theorist, and feminist Elanor Leacock and remained with her until her death in 1987.  Advocacy  In 1960, Haughton joined the newly formed Negro American Labor Council (NALC), serving as assistant to its president, A. Philip Randolph, until his 1962 departure. Following his involvement with NALC, Haughton served as chairman of the Labor and Industry Committee of the New York Branch of the NAACP. Frustrated with perceived passivity within established civil rights organizations, Haughton, in 1964, established the Harlem Unemployment Center. The organization, renamed Fight Back in 1969, employed more aggressive tactics in advocating for minority hiring in the construction industry, equal employment opportunities, and minority (particularly Black and Puerto Rican) inclusion in unions. Haughton was involved in a number of other causes including the anti-war movement, anti- nuclear movement, anti-Apartheid movement, tenants rights movement, and Puerto Rico solidarity movement.

Abdiasis Abu Musab a spokesman for Al-Shabaab denied the attack claiming it to be propaganda. The strike was conducted at the request of the Somali Government with Somalia's information minister Abdirahman Omar Osman stating \\"Those militants were preparing explosives and attacks. Operations against al-Shabaab have been stepped up. We asked the US to help us from the air to make our readied ground offensive more successful\\".

Data derived from Flora of Australia Volume 22 (1984), a product of ABRS, ¬©Commonwealth of Australia. Retrieved 24 November 2018. Description Lysiana subfalcata is a smooth mistletoe with no hairs on its branches, leaves or flowers. The leaves are oblanceolate, mostly grey-green, 20‚Äì120 mm long and 4‚Äì20 mm wide, and do not always have a midvein. The paired flowers have an unlobed or weakly lobed calyx and a corolla which is 25‚Äì50 mm long. The mature corolla is red, rarely yellow, and sometimes green or black tipped. The fruits are indehiscent, succulent, yellowish and 8‚Äì14 mm long, usually pale and somewhat translucent. Lysiana subfalcata is distinguished from other local (Northern Territory) species of Lysiana by the combination of its oblanceolate leaves, its non- winged pedicels, the paired flowers on a common peduncle, its non-septate anthers, the largely red corolla tube with green or yellow lobes, and the yellowish fruit that are longer than wide. Lysiana subfalcata can be confused with Lysiana spathulata, but L. spathulata has broader leaves, septate anthers, and a slightly different host and habitat range. =Flowering and fruiting= The South Australian flora website describes it as flowering and fruiting throughout the year, but in the Northern Territory, the Northern Territory flora website states that it flowers from March to October and fruits from April to October. Ecology It is found in open forests and woodland. However, the Northern Territory flora website describes it as occurring on rocky or gravelly ranges, on hills or rises, on sandplains, and on intermittent watercourses and run-on areas. Major hosts for Lysiana subfalcata in Western Australia are species in the genera Lysiphyllum, Eucalyptus, and Acacia, while in South Australia, and New South Wales (and for Australia) they are listed as species in the genera Atalaya, Heterodendrum, Bauhinia, Santalum and the family Casuarinaceae. Hosts in the Northern Territory are listed as including species of Acacia,Alectryon, Atalaya, Capparis, Eucalyptus, Grevillea, Pittosporum, Senna and Vachellia. Ethnobotany Aboriginal groups use Lysiana subfalcata in various ways: *The Alyawarr for food and as a source of water. *The Anmatyerr for firewood, and to make toys and weapons. *The Kaytetye use the fruit for food. *The Pintupi Luritja use the fruit for food. * The Pitjantjatjara use the fruit as food, to make gums, as plant food for animals; the plant for shelter and shade, to make toys and weapons, fish poisons and traps. *The Waramangu for weapons and tools, fish-poisons and traps. *The Warlpiri as food, as plant foods for animals; the plant for shade and shelter, to make weapons and tools, fish- poisons and traps. *The Western Arrernte people for shade and shelter.

An annex of this book - A Kernel of Dialectics (Medulio dialecticae) is an introduction to scholastic logic, introducing its main categories and thinking methods. Praxis oratoria sive praecepta artis rhetoricae was widely used in the jesuit schools, issued in Munich (1664), Frankfurt an Main (1666), Cologne (1680, 1705, 1707, 1717), W√ºrzburg (1690), Prague (1710), Vienna (1720), Ko≈°ice (1732). He also has written first textbook of music in Lithuania - The Art and Practice of Music (Ars et praxis musica, 1667, 1693, 1977 in Lithuanian). Common fundamentals of music explained - names of the music notes, a scale, clefs; exercises and church music examples included, plainsong (cantus planus), many-voiced, Gregorian, hard (cantus durus) and soft (cantus mollis) chant modes examined. ≈Ωygimantas Liauksminas wrote poems in Ancient Greek, a panegyric to W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa, sermons. Manuscripts of the tractates of theology About the Single God (Tractatus de Deo Uno), A Theologic Tractate about the Law and Justice (Tractatus theologicus de jure et justitia) are also survived.

In the , Foulden had a population of 3 people.  Geography  Foulden is bounded by the Pioneer River to the south and east, Fursden Creek to the north, and the Maraju Yakapari Road to the west. The land is low lying and flat and prone to flooding. The North Coast railway line and the Glenella Connection Road pass through the locality from south to north crossing the river on separate bridges (the road bridge being called the Edmund Casey Bridge) to West Mackay.  History  The locality was named and bounded on 3 September 1999. There was previously a bridge, known as the (Old) Hospital Bridge, which connected Talty Road in Foulden to Bridge Street in West Mackay (adjacent to the Mackay Base Hospital). It was the first bridge over the Pioneer River (and was originally known as the Pioneer Bridge). Construction commenced in 1875. The low bridge was prone to flooding. In April 2009 its replacement was open to the west of the Hospital Bridge carrying the newly-constructed Glenella Connection Road over the Pioneer River. On 5 December 2009, the new bridge was named the Edmund Casey Bridge in honour of long-serving local Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, Ed Casey, as part of the Q150 celebrations. Local residents campaigned to retain the Old Hospital Bridge for recreational use such as walking, cycling and fishing, but the council insisted the costs of making it safe were too great and that only a short segment connected on the West Mackay side would be preserved as a fishing pier. However, in March 2017, Cyclone Debbie damaged the fishing pier., necessitating a new fishing pier to be built. The new pier will be L-shaped and more resistant to flood damage.

It was built during 1880 for Thomas Playfair. It is also known as Baker's Oven - Shop and residence. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The first major building constructed on the western side of George Street was the hospital by July 1788. Located on the block currently bounded by Globe, George and Argyle Streets, which includes the study site, the hospital was seen as being \\"well clear of town\\" at the time. A temporary prefabricated hospital was added in 1790 with the arrival of the Second Fleet. The hospital was upgraded to include three wings by 1802. The yard and gardens at the north of the hospital covered the study site. =Development by William Davis and family= The removal of the hospital building from its George Street location opened this land up for development. The site of No. 123-125 George Street was claimed by William Davis, who had arrived in the colony in February 1800 as an Irish exile. Davis was a blacksmith by trade and had been charged with supplying weapons (pikes) to the Irish uprising in 1798. Arriving in Sydney, he was assigned to work in the lumber yard after having received 200 lashes for his suspected involvement in a planned convict escape. By 1809, Davis had left the lumber yard moving first to Parramatta, then returning to Sydney to live at Church Hill. Davis and his wife, Catherine, prospered in the new colony. By 1816, when the hospital closed, Davis was a successful publican and landholder, having a house at Church Hill and two properties in Parramatta. When the former hospital site became available in 1816, Davis acquired some of the land. This included the former northern wing of the hospital, which Davis converted into four separate houses. These dwellings stood on the site, adjacent to No. 121 George Street until the construction of the Police Station in the early 1880s. With four houses on his land, Davis was not compelled to develop his entire holding at once. A map from 1822 suggests that a quarry may have operated on part of the site. While Davis continued possession of the site, it was not until 1834 that his claim to the land was made official via a grant of 12 perches, made on 29 October by Governor Richard Bourke. Davis died in 1834. The grandson of his brother John, John Davis, was appointed co- executor of Davis' estate with Father John McEncroe, the Catholic Priest at Church Hill, and John Dalley, who owned the property next to Davis' George Street tavern. John Davis took possession of the George Street property and built a house to the rear of it. The George Street frontage remained clear during the ownership of both Davis and Henry Byrnes, who purchased the property around 1877. Byrnes was a waterman in Sydney, operating small boats to service the ships and ferry passengers and cargo between the ships and shore. In the tradition of the previous owners, Byrnes leased the property to be used by traders and store holders. In 1870, W. Hooper, a greengrocer, occupied No. 123 and T. Barry, bootmaker, occupied No. 125. The shops continued as a greengrocer, (J. Paddon) and a bootmaker (J. McAuley) until September 1881, when they and the rear buildings were pulled down. =Redevelopment by Thomas Playfair= Thomas Playfair had arrived in Sydney in 1859 as a sailor in the British Navy aboard the MHS Pelorus. He settled in Sydney after his discharge and went into a partnership with a local wholesale butcher, William Bailey. By 1862, Playfair was operating his own butchery in Lower George Street, providing meat to the ships that were moored in Sydney Cove. In this capacity, he quickly prospered in a lucrative market. In 1875, having lived in The Rocks for over ten years, Playfair was elected to the Sydney City Council as the member for the Gipps Ward, which he represented until a few months before his death in 1893. He served as Mayor of the city in 1885, and in 1889 he was elected to the Legislative Council as the Member for West Sydney, serving until 1891. As a successful merchant, Playfair began to expand his interests in property around The Rocks area, buying land and property. In 1880, with the George Street frontage of No. 121 undeveloped, Henry Byrnes sold the land to Thomas Playfair. Playfair, who had also purchased the two blocks to the south, proceeded to develop the site. He erected a two-storey shop and dwelling fronting George Street with a single storey extension and outbuilding to the rear. In 1882, he built two other shops on the blocks of 123 and 125. The fa√ßade of these shops, executed in Victorian Free Classical Style was extended to include the front of No. 121 to create the shop front as it exists today. Paddon continued as a fruiterer in the new shop at No. 123, and C. W. Danielson, bookmaker in the other. Shop No. 125 became an outfitter and importer outlet in 1885. Playfair continued as landlord until the NSW Government resumed the property in 1900. =Acquisition by the NSW Government= In 1900, Sydney was subjected to a panic attack that accompanied the diagnosis of the bubonic plague in the city. One of the first cases was found to be in The Rocks, and public attention was focused on the area. The government response to the situation was to resume the entire Rocks and Darling Harbour area, an estimated 900 properties, including houses, shops, hotels, warehouses and wharves and including No. 121 George Street. To administer this area, the Government formed the Sydney Harbour Trust in 1902. While this constituted a substantial change for the owners of the stores, many of the occupants stayed on after the changeover. From 1936, the premises were administered by the Maritime Services Board. In 1970 the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority was established to administer and redevelop The Rocks. Nos. 121-125 George Street were to be demolished but after community protest and Green Bans placed on the area many historic buildings were saved. In 1985 the Sydney Cove Authority was formed, and then in 1999 the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority was created to administer and protect the area, signalling a new appreciation of heritage in the area.  Description  No. 121 George Street is a two-storey commercial property that appears as part of a row of three shops with the same facade design. In fact, No. 121 was built before Nos. 123-125, however the front facade was modified when its neighbours were built so that the property appeared as one. The street facade is designed in the Victorian Free Classical style that was typically used for commercial properties and whenever a veneer of respectability was sought. The classically inspired stucco detailing was applied to the rendered masonry wall allowing for the flexibility of decorative motifs without slowing the construction of the building.Godden Mackay, 1998: 22 Style: Victorian Free Classical Style; Storeys: 2; Roof Cladding: Corrugated iron; Floor Frame: Timber/vinyl and carpet finish; Ceilings: Plasterboard/lined with timber boards. = Condition = The exterior and interior of the building are in good condition. There is a continuing need for effective roof level maintenance to ensure the building is kept weather tight.Godden Mackay, 1998: 32-33 Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed.

The bakery addition was modified to accommodate a living room and bathroom for residential use. Further modifications have since been made to accommodate use of the building as a cafe and sandwich bar. *1982The street awning was reconstructed and the parapet reinstated. *1980sThe front fa√ßade was restored. = Further information = Nos. 121-125 George Street are included as a single listing on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate and the non-statutory National Trust of Australia register.  Heritage listing  As at 28 January 2009, No. 121 George Street is a representative example of a commercial building in the Victorian Free Classical style. It was built in 1880 by Thomas Playfair, as one of his investments in The Rocks area and has had a continual commercial use since it was built. The surviving fabric has the ability to yield information on early building techniques as well as the way of life for the inhabitants. The bakery is a rare surviving example of such a facility constructed in 1922, and is a fine example of the tools used for the application of a traditional skill. Although now partly removed, some of the peel brick oven survives including the iron doors, front wall to the oven and the associated tools allowing for interpretation as a traditional oven and bakery. The building is an integral part of the fabric of The Rocks showing the growth of the area and in particular the importance of the harbourside to the commercial precinct of The Rocks Shop and Residence - Bakers Oven was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria.

Previously he served as the executive director of Queers for Economic Justice, policy institute fellow with National LGBTQ Task Force, U.S. & Global Health Policy Director of Treatment Action Group, and public education and communications coordinator for the New York State Black Gay Network. Currently Farrow is senior editor with TheBody.com and TheBodyPro.com.  Early life and education  Descended from a long line of African Methodist Episcopal ministers, Farrow began his work as an activist in 1998 at the AIDS Task Force of Greater Cleveland, where he taught and organized sex-education workshops for high school students across his home city. The experience left him intensely interested in social determinants surrounding HIV/AIDS. Just as pertinent to his development as an activist was witnessing HIV/AIDS discrimination in the church. \\"Since HIV/AIDS was automatically linked to homosexuality back then, you'd hear a lot of the fire- and-brimstone-type speeches, about how being gay was an abomination and a sin.\\" An alumnus of the Hawken School, after graduating from Ohio Wesleyan University with his BA in Theatre, he moved to NYC in 1999 to pursue an acting career. Arriving 3 weeks before the death of Amadou Diallo, Farrow found himself profoundly affected by the event as well as by pervasive incidents of violence against black and brown queer youth in the West Village. Following an acclaimed performance as James Baldwin in Mr. Baldwin Goes to Heaven at La MaMa Etc., Farrow shifted his focus from performing to combating these acts of social injustice. For the next few years he worked against incarceration issues as the southern region coordinator of Critical Resistance and fought against gentrification and the unjust prosecution of queer youth in New York City as a founding member and adult ally of FIERCE! Responding to the dearth of Black voices on queer and racial issues, Farrow began blogging resulting in the publication of a number of acclaimed essays. These essays continue to receive citations in numerous books and academic journals and helped to expand the tone of conversations on race and sexuality in the media. Concurrent with this time, Farrow attended City University of New York's School of Journalism while also working at Clamor Magazine as the magazine's culture editor.  Career  Working with the New York State Black Gay Network as communications and public education coordinator in the mid-2000s, Farrow created anti- homophobia social marketing campaigns to combat misconceptions about HIV/AIDS and discrimination against the LGBT community in NYC by collaborating with religious organizations to diminish the impact of homophobia. Farrow joined Queers for Economic Justice as a volunteer shelter project facilitator, later becoming the organization's executive director. As U.S. & Global Health Policy Director of Treatment Action Group, Farrow used his platform to push coverage of access to healthcare as a social justice and human rights issues, fight against HIV discrimination, mobilize campaigns to halt the rapid spread of HIV and tuberculosis among people of color throughout the south, and push for the expansion of the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, and fair drug pricing to end the national HIV epidemic. During this time he also published a qualitative research project exploring the role of community mobilization in response to HIV, as well as helping to craft a national strategy to end stock-outs of TB drugs. Additionally, as a direct consequence of his lobbying, Governor Andrew Cuomo's NYS End AIDS 2020 agenda was moved to include new funding for the expansion of LGBTQ youth housing options and provide minors with HIV or reproductive care while maintaining their privacy, even if they were on their parents‚Äô insurance. On October 30, 2017 Farrow joined TheBody and TheBodyPro as a Senior Editor. A strong advocate for equal representation, Farrow is noted for his hard line against discrimination. He is also a noted proponent and user of Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as a means of deterring HIV.  Writing  Farrow's writing tackles a range of difficult topics including race, inequality, healthcare, and sexuality and has appeared in major publications including The Atlantic, Color Lines, The American Prospect, Out, POZ, Logo, HIV Plus, Rewire.News, HuffPost, Q Salt Lake Magazine, The Feminist Wire, TheGrio, Washington Blade, The Scholar and Feminist Online, LAMDA Literary, The Black AIDS Institute, and AlterNet. He also co-edited Letters from Young Activists: Today's Rebels Speak Out and Stand Up!: The Shifting Politics of Racial Uplift. His work is included in the anthologies: We Have Not Been Moved: Resisting Racism and Militarism in 21st Century America, Spirited: Affirming the Soul of Black Lesbian and Gay Identity, Against Equality: Queer Critiques of Same-Sex Marriage, For Colored Boys Who Have Considered Suicide When The Rainbow Is Still Not Enough, and Black Gay Genius: Answering Joseph Beam's Call.

The exhibition took place between January 30 to February 28, 1993, as part of Hong Kong Arts Festival in Hong Kong City Hall and at Pao Galleries, Hong Kong Arts Centre. The touring exhibition travelled to Taipei, Melbourne, London, Vancouver, and various cities in the USA from 1993 to 1997. Considered a seminal snapshot of the Chinese avant-garde scene of the time, the exhibition served as an inspiration for the exhibition \\"Art and China after 1989: Theatre of the World\\" presented in 2017 at the Guggenheim Museum in New York.  Curators  The exhibition was curated by Chang Tsongzung Johnson, ÂºµÈ†å‰ªÅ and Li Xianting, Ê†óÊÜ≤Â∫≠, with assistant curator Liao Wen. The Hong Kong exhibition curator was Oscar Ho Hing-Kay. The show included an \\"extraordinary roll-call\\" of artists, such as Wang Guangyi, Gu Wenda, Fang Lijun, and Zeng Fanzhi. Curator Chang Tsongzung wrote, \\"The art of the Post-1989 period was significant as it characterised the spirit of the new decade, closing the chapter of the 1980s. It was important also for the fact that it presented to the world the first major coherent overview of China's experimental art scene, and has maintained a continuing dialogue ever since.\\" A catalog of the exhibition, edited by Valerie C. Doran and featuring a preface by Chang Tsongzung, offers an in- depth study of the artistic undercurrents and cultural sensibilities for the creation of experimental art in China during the late 1980s and the early 1990s, through contributions from a number of noted critics and art historians.

Description In culture, colonies of U. orissi are yellowish white in colour before darkening to buff or brownish-orange. Colonies are flat, dense and take on a woolly to coarsely powdery texture. U. orissi degrades keratin relatively quickly. U. orissi has a heterothallic mating system, requiring two compatible \\"sexes\\" for sexual reproduction to occur. It produces urease enzyme, allowing it to convert urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Unlike many other members of the genus Uncinocarpus, U. orissi are lacking in appendages.

The 2nd Army was formed twice. The first formation was between the beginning of March 1918 and April as a reaction to the Austro-German occupation of Ukraine. The second formation was created on June 18, 1918, as a part of the Eastern Front. The Army was disbanded on July 16, 1919. History On March 17, 1918, the Second All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets decided to create armed forces to counter foreign and contra-revolutionary forces. Five armies of some 3.000 -3.500 men were created. In fact, these armies were only brigades with limited combat capabilities. Evgenii Venediktov became the commander of the 2nd Army. In March 1918, it defended Yekaterinoslav and then retreated to the Donbass. By the beginning of April, there were 1,000 bayonets in the army and a small number of cavalry. Together with parts of the 1st Army, she took part in skirmishes in Ukraine in the Chaplino area near Millerovo, after which one part of the army withdrew to Tsaritsyn, and the other to Kalach and Voronezh where it was disbanded. On June 18, 1918 the 2nd Army was created a second time from the detachments of the Orenburg and Ufa groups. It was part of the Eastern Front. In June - July 1918 it fought in the basin of the Kama and Belaya rivers against White Guards troops. On August 5, 1918, units of the 2nd Army launched an offensive and cut off the Nurlat - Bugulma railway, but then came under a White counterattack and retreated to Menzelinsk and Sarapul. In August 1918, because of the Izhevsk‚ÄìVotkinsk Uprising, it retreated to the area around Arsk, Vyatskiye Polyany and Menzelinsk, north of Votkinsk. It participated in the offensive of the Eastern Front 1918-1919 and led the attack in the Kazan and Izhevsk-Votkinsk operations (September-November 1918). The 2nd Army launched an attack on the Sarapul - Krasnoufimsk sector (November 1918), acted against the Perm Group of Alexander Kolchak's Army (December 1918) and fought near Kungur and Osa between December 1918 and February 1919. In March-May 1919, during the Spring Offensive of the White Russian Army it retreated to the area of the Vyatka River. In May-June 1919, the 2nd Army participated in the Counteroffensive of the Eastern front and during the Sarapul‚ÄìVotkinsk Operation, the 2nd Army occupied Izhevsk (June 7) and the Votkinsky Plant (June 11). In the course of the further offensive, it conducted the Perm and Yekaterinburg operations, taking Kungur (July 1) and Yekaterinburg (July 14). The 2nd Army was disbanded on July 16, 1919, and the army administration was transferred to the Southern Front and became the administration of Special Group Shorin.

Members of the group were born in Mainland China and later migrated to Taiwan. The heyday of the group came during the 1960s‚Äì70s, coinciding with the period of the Great Cultural Revolution in Mainland China. The Fifth Moon Group is closely related to and usually associated with the Eastern Painting Group (Êù±ÊñπÁï´ÊúÉ) in membership, artistic works, and exhibitions.  Formation  The idea of the Fifth Moon Group came about as an answer to the group of friends‚Äô growing discontent with the conservative and lackluster art scene in Taiwan. During their first three years of National Taiwan Normal University, the would-be members of the Fifth Moon Group visited the annual Taiwan Provincial Fine Arts Exhibition and found the award-winning artworks to be poorly made and lacking in both diversity and variety. In their fourth year, the group attempted to participate, but they did not get accepted into the exhibition. Motivated by the incident, the group decided to hold their own exhibition; later, they received support from their university tutor. In May 1957, the Fifth Moon Group was officially founded by a group of painters who were graduates from the Art Department at the National Taiwan Normal University (Traditional Chinese: ÂúãÁ´ãËá∫ÁÅ£Â∏´ÁØÑÂ§ßÂ≠∏). The leading figure of the group was Liu Kuo-sung (Liu Guosong, ÂäâÂúãÊùæ), and other core members included Chuang Tse (Zhuang Zhi, ËéäÂñÜ), Feng Chung-jui (Feng Zhongrui, È¶ÆÈçæÁùø), Kuo Tung-Jung (Guo Dongrong, ÈÉ≠Êù±Ê¶Æ), Li Fang-Chih (Li Fangzhi, ÊùéËä≥Êûù), Kuo Yu-Lun (Guo Yulun, ÈÉ≠Ë±´ÂÄ´), Chen Jing-Rong (Èô≥ÊôØÂÆπ), and Ku Fu-Sheng (Gu Fusheng, È°ßÁ¶èÁîü). They were subsequently joined by other artists, including Chen Ting-shi (Èô≥Â∫≠Ë©©) and Han Hsiang-Ning (Han Xiangning, ÈüìÊπòÂØß).  Development = Artistic style = Since their emergence, members of the Fifth Moon Group have been reputed to be pioneers who modernized Chinese paintings and revolutionized the Taiwanese art scene. While artists in the West had been developing and experimenting with new styles since the late 19th and early 20th centuries, artists in China were still largely working in the style of social realism. Many were constrained by the pressure of traditional styles, and very few were able to produce works that could be considered modern. The Fifth Moon Group's emergence and works helped to pitch Chinese painting into the 20th century. Since the 1960s, the group became the pioneering art society in Taiwan, using the new modern style as their visual manifesto. The group's iconic style is a hybridization of bold brushstrokes of Eastern calligraphy tradition and the shapes and colors of Western aesthetics, characterized by an innovative representation of freedom, conceptualization, and format of painting. = Members = The founding members of the Fifth Moon Group include: Chuang Tse (Zhuang Zhi, ËéäÂñÜ), Feng Chung-jui (Feng Zhongrui, È¶Æ Èçæ Áùø), Kuo Tung-Jung (Guo Dongrong, ÈÉ≠Êù±Ê¶Æ), Li Fang- Chih (Li Fangzhi, ÊùéËä≥Êûù), Kuo Yu-Lun (Guo Yulun, ÈÉ≠Ë±´ÂÄ´), Chen Jing-Rong (Èô≥ÊôØÂÆπ), and Ku Fu-Sheng (Gu Fusheng, È°ßÁ¶èÁîü), and they were subsequently joined by other artists including Chen Ting-shi (Èô≥Â∫≠Ë©©) and Han Hsiang-ning (Han Xiangning, ÈüìÊπòÂØß). * Kuo Yu-Lun (Guo Yulun, ÈÉ≠Ë±´ÂÄ´) * Li Fang-Chih (Li Fangzhi, ÊùéËä≥Êûù) * Liu Guosong (Liu Kuo-Sung, ÂäâÂúãÊùæ) * Guo Dongrong (Guo Dongrong, ÈÉ≠Êù±Ê¶Æ) * Zheng Qiongjuan (Cheng Chiung-Chuan ÈÑ≠ÁìäÂ®ü ) * Chen Jingrong (Ch‚Äôen Ching-Jung, Èô≥ÊôØÂÆπ)The Search for the Avant-Garde 1946-69.

The exhibition toured to various locations from 1997 to 1999, presenting the cultural impact of East Asia's rapid urban development in the late twentieth century through a mix of visual art, architecture, and film. The exhibition opened in 1997 at the Vienna Secession in Austria, and then traveled in various forms to MoMA PS1, New York; CAPC Mus√©e d‚Äôart contemporain de Bordeaux; the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Denmark; Hayward Gallery, London; Bangkok; and Kiasma, Helsinki. Overall, it involved more than 150 architects, artists, filmmakers, and designers. According to Asia Art Archive, Cities on the Move was ‚Äúa landmark event in contemporary exhibition- making for its extensive use of urbanism theories, its strong involvement of architects, and its attempt to recreate an ever-evolving city within an exhibition space‚Äù, which included a continuous programme of performances, screenings, and discussions during the exhibition period.  Background  The exhibition's origins can be traced to 1990, when curators Hou Hanru and Hans Ulrich Obrist both moved to Paris, and Hou introduced Obrist to Chinese and Hong Kong art for the first time. Conceived during a period of rapid urban and economic growth in East Asia, the exhibition's first iteration opened just a few months after the beginning of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which saw the economic collapse of multiple countries in the region.  Exhibition Concept, History and Venues  Cities on the Move presented ‚Äúthe dynamic and highly creative situation of contemporary urban visual culture in East Asia‚Äù in the context of the unprecedented growth of cities in the region. The exhibition curators Hou Hanru and Hans Ulbrecht Obrist chose cities as a site to explore themes of modernisation such as consumerism, monumental architecture, traffic congestion, privacy and public space, and competitive urbanism. Over two years and across seven locations, the exhibition's curators and artists experimented with different strategies to respond to the unfolding sociocultural, economic, and political crises in Asia. In each setting, the project took on various forms through new commissions, artists, groupings and themes. = Secession Vienna = Cities on the Move was first installed on the eve of the hundredth anniversary of the Vienna Secession.

The exhibition was a collective endeavour by the Siam Society with the support and artistic contributions of the Asia Europe Foundation, in collaboration with European Union member states and the European Commission. Based on the exhibition concept of Hou and Obrist, the Bangkok exhibition was co-ordinated by Ole Scheeren, Thomas Nordanstad and Albert Paraviwongchirachai, exhibition director of the Siam Society. More than 100 artists and architects from China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Europe took part. Since the city had \\"no museum for contemporary art that could host a show like Cities on the Move\\", the organisers chose the city itself as the exhibition space, turning the life, people, and infrastructure of the city into the content of the exhibition. = Kiasma, Helsinki = The exhibition was staged at the Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki, from 5 November to 19 December 1999.

(Dallas), a leading US manufacturer of women's apparel, and a breeder/owner of Thoroughbred race horses, including Dayatthespa. He would sometimes use the titles of shows, names of actors and songs as eponyms for his horses, such as the mare named after Linda Eder, a star in his Broadway musical, Jekyll & Hyde, and another named after \\"This Is the Moment\\", a song in the same show.  Early life and career  Frankel was born on August 1, 1930 in Queens, New York City. His father, Abraham, was a dress manufacturer. Frankel attended the University of Illinois, where he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism. Frankel's business career began when he started working for his father's garment manufacturing business in New York. In 1964, he founded his own garment manufacturing company, Jerrell Inc., located in Dallas, Texas, and became a leading US manufacturer of women's apparel. A few of Jerrell's popular labels include Selena and Salcedo which was sold at popular department store chains in the US, such as Macy's and J. C. Penney, and the Stonebridge label sold exclusively by Dillard's. Broadway productions Over time, Frankel's interests led him into the business of Broadway production, and in 1997, he co-produced his first Broadway show, Jekyll & Hyde, with Jeffrey Richards (producer). He went on to produce more than 50 shows over the next two decades, several of which won Tony Awards, including Death of a Salesman (1999), Glengarry Glen Ross (2005), Spring Awakening (2006), August: Osage County (2007), Hair (2009), La Cage aux Folles (2010), The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess (2011), Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (2012) and All the Way (2014). His final production was Come from Away (2017). Thoroughbred racing Thoroughbred racing was another of Frankel's passions, believed by some to stem from his love of gambling and willingness to take risks in business. His involvement with the sport as an owner/breeder began in 1974, with the bulk of his lifetime earnings recorded from 2000 forward under his given name, Gerald. Multiple graded stakes winning owner was his best racing class achieved with earnings of $1,907,088.00. He and his brother, Ronald, were partners on several horses, including Dayatthespa, a filly they purchased by private treaty when she was a two-year-old in training. As a yearling, she sold for $50,000 at the 2010 Fasig-Tipton Preferred New York Bred Yearling Sale. She was sired by City Zip, trained by Chad Brown, and co- owned with Bradley Thoroughbreds and Steve Laymon. She won over $2,280,000, including the Yaddo Handicap at Saratoga Race Course in 2013 and 2014, the 2014 First Lady Stakes at Keeneland and 2014 Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf with a 1¬º length victory. Of the notable race horses Frankel bred, Joey Franco was the 2003 California-bred Horse of the year and winner of over $635,000 including the 2003 Triple Bend Invitational Handicap at Hollywood Park Racetrack and Breeders' Cup at Del Mar racetrack. Frankel named Joey Franco after the mispronunciation of his own name when people who didn't know him returned his calls, obviously having misunderstood the fast spoken messages he left for a callback. Frankel sometimes named his horses using eponyms derived from titles of shows, or from the names of actors and songs. A few examples include a mare named after Linda Eder, the leading star in his Broadway musical Jekyll & Hyde, another he named after the song \\"This Is the Moment\\" from the same show, and one he named Osage County, after his play August: Osage County (2007). Personal life and death Frankel resided in Dallas, Texas and Carlsbad, California. His first marriage to Sandra Light ended in divorce. His second wife, Honu Stern, died in 2008. He had a son and two daughters, and at the time of his death had a partner, Mary Casey. Frankel died on November 17, 2018 in Manhattan at age 88.

Orsolano then opened a shop for \\"Cutters and sausages\\", which did not give the expected profits. On February 14, 1834, he raped and killed 10-year-old Caterina Scavarda, disposing of her remains in San Giorgio's countryside. On June 24, he raped and killed 9-year- old Caterina Givogre, beheading her afterwards and throwing the remains into the Piatonia stream. The search for the two missing girls did not yield any result, so the alleged crimes were attributed to packs of wolves that infested the area. On March 3, 1835, during a market day in San Giorgio, Orsolano persuaded 14-year-old Francesca Tonso to follow him to his house with the excuse of buying eggs. There he raped and killed her, cutting the body up with a cleaver, putting the remains in a jute sack and throwing in the same stream. In order not to arouse suspicion, he checked if he had any dirt on his clothes and washed the bag in the river. The girl's aunt and parents reported her disappearance. They directed the authorities to Orsolano's house to ask him questions, as he resembled the man last seen with the girl, according to the aunt. He reacted abruptly and drove them away. The police subsequently discovered the precedents of Orsolano: while examining his house, they found Francesca's clogs, shreds of clothing, bloodstains and a partially dirty bag. He arrested shortly after and taken to the castle of Ivrea, after the inhabitants of San Giorgio had tried to lynch him. He continued to deny the crimes, but got drunk and confessed everything. In addition, an officer assured him that if he confessed and declared himself mad, he would be spared the death penalty. On March 13, at the end of the trial, Orsolano was sentenced to death in Ivrea and hanged four days later in his hometown, at the Sant'Anna fraction.Proceedings of the trial, court of Ivrea , ruling of March 13, 1835 While in the courtroom, Orsolano listened to his sentence with indifference. The University of Turin, on the day of the sentence, sent three surgeons to \\"dissect the corpse\\" and take away the head and testicles, described by doctors as \\"bulkier than usual\\". His skull was then brought to the Museum of Anatomy, and a cast of the head is still preserved at the Museum of Human Anatomy Luigi Rolando in Turin.

It was the only exhibition of the artist collective 'group 1890', hence the only existing record of the group's exhibition history in the 1960s contemporary art in India. The group was an entirely male association with 12 members which 'stood passionately and romantically for values of modernism that signaled change'. The members were Raghav Kaneria, M. Reddeppa Naidu, Ambadas Khobragade, Rajesh Mehra, Gulam Mohammed Sheikh, Jagdish Swaminathan, Himmat Shah, Jeram Patel, S. G. Nikam, Eric Bowen, Jyoti Bhatt, and Balkrishna Patel. All of which participated in this inaugural exhibition. A meeting of the artist group was held from 12 to 14 May 1967 in Baroda to discuss the possibility of having their second exhibition which did not eventually materialise. Geeta Kapur, the noted female art historian, critic, and curator based in New Delhi, was involved in the said meeting and was captured among the male artists in two photographs collected in the Gulammohammed Sheikh Archive, part of The Baroda Archives digitalised by Asia Art Archive.  The exhibition  The GROUP 1890 exhibition was dedicated to the memory of Georges Braque and was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister Sri Jawaharlal Nehru. It presented 8 to 10 works from each of the 12 artists. Artworks on display included oil paintings, drawings, collages, prints, and sculptures. The exhibition was conceptualised as a ground to showcase the members' artistic creation and as a chance to make the group's manifesto public. A full-page manifesto and an introductory article titled 'Surrounded by Infinity...' written by the surrealist poet Octavio Paz on 12 October 1963 in New Delhi was included in the exhibition catalogue, along with the artist biographies. Octavio Paz, the then Mexican Ambassador to India, claimed in the introductory article that the artist collective 'group 1890' signified a will of change and freedom in the field of contemporary art in 1960s India. There he wrote, '...1890, which pretends not to be a school, is a movement. A movement which affirms itself as a will of change...The creative act is based upon a radical criticism. Criticism of the world and criticism of the artist and his means of expression...I affirm that this exhibition is one sign of the new time, a time that will be of criticism as well as creation. Something precious is being born with these artists.' He went on to interpret the spirit of 'group 1890' movement as avant-garde and the inaugural exhibition as a mean to challenge the binary conception of tradition and contemporaneity, 'It is not difficult to find in the works of this exhibition the echoes, the prolongations and influences of universal contemporary painting. These young men, with a full conscience, have grasped modern language. Who will draw to reproach them? There is no other language, it is the only one alive. And how not to see the frequency with which that language ceases to be a prescription and becomes a sign of self? Furthermore, what is called tradition is nothing else but an ensemble or succession of works. That is, of inventions and variations on those inventions, contemplated from an ever-changing point of view: the present. Even if art critics and historians feel themselves installed in eternity. Tradition: change. 1890: breakthrough and restart.' A review of the GROUP 1890 exhibition written by Charles Fabri, Hungarian Archaeologist and Art Historian in India, was published in The Statesman on 21 October 1963  group 1890  The term 'group 1890' was used to describe both the exhibition title, the artist collective, and a movement these artists provoked. 'group 1890' as an artist collective has 12 members, mainly artists from Delhi and Bombay. Many of them were graduated from the University of Baroda and were in their early 30s when the GROUP 1890 exhibition was held at Lalit Kala Akademi. The group was described as progressive and against the Bengal School. Some of the members continued their art practice after the group was disintegrated. These artists became respected names in the field of contemporary art in India. This artist collective was the brain child of Jagdish Swaminathan and formed in a meeting of artists held at Bhavnagar on 25‚Äì26 August 1962. The name 'group 1890' was derived from the number of the house of J. Pandya, where the artists gathered and drafted their manifesto. The 1962 Bhavnagar meeting \\"was the outcome of prolonged discussions through personal meetings and correspondence over a period of two years between like-minded artists on the situation existing in modern Indian art. Having come to a common understanding regarding the vitiating influences which hinder the unfolding of authentic development in art, it was decided to launch the group 1890 movement.\\" The group's manifesto was discussed at the Bhavnagar meeting and later adopted in New Delhi on 19 July 1963, a few months before the group's inaugural exhibition.

Biography=Early years= Francisco Salas was born in Albaic√≠n during its siege by the French. His father died the same year he was born. Thus, the boy had to work hard from early age. A famous tenor Lorenzo Valencia from Madrid came to Granada to sing in some operas, especially those by Rossini. He became Salas's first teacher and protector. In 1829 they went to Madrid, where the seventeen- year-old entered the choir of Teatro de la Cruz. There he studied with Jos√© Reart and tenor Jos√© Valero. In October 1831 Salas made his soloist debut substituting the bass protagonist in I fidanzati, ossia Il contestabile di Chester by Pacini, and had success. From this moment he left the choir to perform \\"partiquinos y suplementos\\", and already in 1833 his name opened the playbill for the Le calife de Bagdad by Boieldieu. Around that time he met , one of the most important singers on the Spanish scene of the period. They married and had three children. At their recitals, apart from the Italian airs, they both sang Spanish music (tonadillas, boleros, dances etc.). =Collaboration with Basilio Basili= B√°rbara's sister, Teodora Lamadrid, an actress too, was married to Basilio Basili, a \\"Spanishized\\" Italian tenor and composer. With him Salas made his first attempt at Spanish lyrical comedy, El novio y el concierto, a sequence of Spanish songs mixed with Italian-stzled airs and recitatives. Although composed by a famous dramatist Manuel Bret√≥n de los Herreros, this comedy went almost unnoticed. Salas' reputation at that time was based mainly on the comedy roles in Italian operas (I due Figaro by Mercadante, Un'avventura di Scaramuccia by Ricci and works by Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti). In 1840 Salas came into possession of the Teatro de la Cruz. With this he began to promote Spanish works by Basili. Notable is El contrabandista, of which the press wrote that it was \\"the first Spanish production of such a class in modern time\\" (la primera producci√≥n espa√±ola de esta clase en los tiempos modernos). Basili composed soon El ventorrillo de Crespo, but this was blamed for being \\"a crude copy of Italian opera with Spanish songs\\" (burda copia de la √≥pera italiana con canciones espa√±olas). In 1842 the theatre's company spent two months in Granada, where also the famous singer Pauline Viardot stayed. She met Salas and even performed some duets with him. Being only 30, Salas was considered the most prominent Spanish bass- baritone. In 1842 he became famous also as a composer, publishing a song, Los toros del puerto, which gained an enormous popularity. Its tune was later used by Franz Liszt in one of his compositions. With some other songs and a new stage work by Basili, La pendencia, Salas arranged with a tenor Ojeda in 1844 a northern tour ending in Paris. They intended to have a performance at an Italian theatre led by Rossini, but for some couldn't to this. Nevertheless they gave some private performances in aristocratic salons. A further opera by Basili, El diablo predicador, gets same accusions of mixing national songs with Italian style. The society felt the request for a typically Spanish theater, and the Academia Real de la M√∫sica created an association to support such attempts. They organized several meetings at the Liceo Art√≠stico, but making little utility. Even the royal family was interested in creating Spanish music, which could compete with Italian: at the wedding fests of Isabella II and infante Francis Spanish music prevailed, and Salas performed some songs during the presentation of Hartzenbusch's La alcaldesa de Zamarramala. =The creation of zarzuela= In 1846 the Teatro de la Cruz was closed, and the leading role in the struggle for the Spanish lyrical theater passed to the Teatro del Circo. Many songs staged there were chosen not because of their musical merits but because they let Salas show his abilities: this was one of the best guarantees for getting the public. In 1848 composer Rafael Hernando with librettist Mariano Pina Boh√≠gas produced Colegialas y soldados at the '. It is considered the first play responding to the future canons of the zarzuela genre. Hernando soon repeated the same features in El duende, staged at the Teatro Variedades. Motivated by these successful works, Francisco Salas encouraged some writers and composers to produce more zarzuelas, both comic and serious. The principal pioneers of the genre became composers Joaqu√≠n Gaztambide, Francisco Asenjo Barbieri, Crist√≥bal Oudrid, and a bit later Emilio Arrieta; they were accompanied by dramatists , Luis Mariano de Larra, Luis de Olona and Jos√© de la Villa.

It shows 8000 labeled plants from all over the world in the open-air displays and several greenhouses. The park and the greenhouses are accessible free of charge during opening hours.  History  The area of today's botanical garden in 1919 with the municipal nursery and the building of 1914, which is now used as an orangery The first botanical garden in St. Gallen was established in 1878 in the municipal park east of the newly built Museum of Nature. The museum's director was the botanist and plant collector Friedrich Bernhard Wartmann, who desired to complement the exhibits of the museum with a living plant collection. He created the 6000 m¬≤ (1.5 acres) garden (which also included an alpine garden) with his friend Theodor Schlatter (1847‚Äì1918), a botanist and teacher.Toni B√ºrgin and Jonas Barandun: Naturmuseum St. Gallen: Gesammelte Natur ‚Äì gestern, heute, morgen. Naturmuseum St. Gallen (Editor), St. Gallen 2003, p. 15. Online The largest part of this display garden was demolished in 1918, to make space for the new Museum of History and Ethnology. The second botanical garden was built near the University of Teacher Education St. Gallen. It was demolished in 1934 due to construction work. The ground- breaking ceremony occurred by turning the first sod on 16 June 1945 in the Stephanshorn area of Neudorf, where the municipal nursery had been for decades. Initially, several school classes from St. Gallen and their biology teachers were involved in creating the garden, including the Head of the Gardening Office Paul Z√ºlli. Subsequently, the expansion was managed and conducted mainly by the City of St. Gallen, who owned the park. In 1993, an architecturally noteworthy alpine house was built in the Botanical Garden. The new tropical house was built in 1998 and expanded in 2007 by erecting the orchid house. The open-air area was substantially refurbished in 2011.  Description = Open-air area = The open-air area is divided in 20 departments, which are connected by walking paths. A pergola and some benches provide space for rest and contemplation. The departments contain cherry blossom and maple trees, perennial plants, an iris garden and flower beds with roses, narcissus plants, ferns and barberry plants, a raised-bed rock garden, a flower pot garden and a water garden as well as flower beds with varying themes. In the crop departments, poisonous and medicinal plants, useful plants and grasslands are shown.  Geographical sections  Vial‚Äôs primrose (primula vialii) In the four geographical departments Alpinum, Europe, America and Asia typical plants of the respective regions are presented. The department Europe shows in terraced beds the diversity of the native Swiss flora and the wide range of flora in the very different European climates. In the America section, an Indian summer can be experienced on a small scale in autumn with the colorfully discolored leaves of the American trees and shrubs planted there. In the geographical section of Asia, 400 plant species grow from the steppe, forest and mountain areas with different Asian climates. In the center of this section there is a Japanese garden with a small pond and a stone lantern, which was modeled after the Imperial Garden. One of the most popular places to stay in the botanical garden is the pergola, which is densely covered with Asian climbing plants. This area is particularly attractive at the heyday of the Vial's primrose (primula vialii), which has its natural location in the Chinese provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan and was planted here in hundreds. The Alpinum department is mostly located on a slight hillside and consists of two different areas. For the Alpinum S√§ntisgebiet, limestone blocks were used to create rock sections for species of the alpine step. Low-growing birch species and subalpine tall perennials grow on the banks of a small pond. In the Alpinum Swiss Alps, on the other hand, older coniferous trees such as Swiss stone pine (pinus cembra) and Swiss mountain pine (pinus mugo) dominate. For alpine plants, which require more neutral to acid soil pH conditions, an area with Verrucano rock was created. Educational departments  The three educational departments with the topics of biology, genetics and systematics are used in practical demonstrations to complement the knowledge that is only theoretically available to most visitors: *The Department of Biology informs with the help of typical living plants about the topics flower biology, distribution biology and special plant nutrition. *In the Department of Genetics, the laws governing the transmission of herbal characteristics to the offspring with the corresponding plants are presented. In the center of the department is the Mendel Garden named after Gregor Mendel with mutations of various trees and shrubs. *The Department of Systematics shows around 500 different plantain plant species from 100 plant families. This area was extensively renewed and rewritten in the years 2013/2014 based on new scientific findings regarding the relationships between the plant species and the resulting renaming. = Greenhouses = Plants of the rainforest, succulents and crops such as cinnamon, coffee or vanilla are shown in a 1998 newly built large tropical green house with two pools and a grandstand. A special attraction is the basin with the Victoria water lily. In 2007, an orchid house was added to the tropical house. In an Alpine house, built in 1993 in an unusual architecture, the alpine flora is housed. Furthermore, there is the small carnivorous planthouse, an extra greenhouse for carnivorous plants, as well as a lithops house, in which living stones are shown. = Orangery = The Orangery is a unique, well-preserved historic building with a red-tiled roof that was built on this site in 1914 along with other buildings for the then municipal nursery. Its special architectural features are the supporting structure made of laminated wooden beams based on the Otto Hetzer principle and the roof lantern mounted on them, which ensures a better light incidence. Between October and May the potted plants spend the winter at the Orangery at a temperature of about 5 ¬∞C. During the summer months, there are exhibitions on natural history topics and other events.  Activities and services  On the first Sunday of each month, public tours of the outdoor area and the greenhouses take place regularly. Special tours can be booked for a fee. Throughout the year, numerous public events such as lectures, readings, exhibitions and courses take place. In addition to a sponsorship association, the association Botanischer Zirkel St. Gallen also supports the organisation and implementation. Once a year, the botanical garden organizes a full-day garden party. Every autumn a public plant exchange takes place. The Botanical Garden of St. Gallen is itself a member of the association Hortus Botanicus Helveticus and participates as such in the BOTANICA Initiative - The last of its kind, a four-week series of events of 20 botanical gardens in Switzerland, with this to draw attention to their contribution to the conservation of biodiversity. During the mushroom season, the Botanical Garden of St. Gallen operates as a public mushroom advisory center at certain times of the day from August to October and offers free provision and control of privately collected edible mushrooms. The grandstand in the tropical house can be rented for private events with up to 50 people.  Charity  One year after the last reconstruction of the botanical garden, the non-profit association Friends of the Botanical Garden of St. Gallen was founded in 1946 with the aim of providing ideal and material support for the institution. This was due, among other things, to its involvement in the financing of new greenhouses and renewal work in outdoor areas. The association supports the botanical garden in its public relations work, finances publications and conducts its own events, the proceeds of which benefit the garden.  Publications  The long- standing director of the institution, Hanspeter Schumacher, published in 2013 a German language guide through the botanical garden entitled The Botanical Garden of St. Gallen: A Place of Rest, Education and Encounter (Der Botanische Garten St. Gallen: Ort der Erholung, Bildung und Begegnung). In addition, the Botanical Garden publishes a monthly information sheet in DIN A4 format. Each of these sheets covers a specific plant topic comprehensively. Each month, a newsletter with past and planned activity reports is also published.  Works of art  Pan by Wilhelm Meier Works of art can be found at various locations in the outdoor area, such as the 1957 sculpture Pan by the Swiss sculptor Wilhelm Meier, whose works can be found in many parts of the city. The entrance area to the botanical garden at the sliding gate at the Stephanshornstrasse was designed with several large artistically crafted Rorschach sandstone shelves.  Planetary path  The botanical garden is the starting point of the 1979 built St. Galler Planetenweg, which leads from here via M√∂rschwil to Obersteinach. Starting point of this long thematic trail is the model of the sun next to the tropical house. The trail leads inside the garden past the scale models of Mercury and Venus to Earth and Moon.Oskar Keller: Unser Sonnensystem. Ein F√ºhrer zum Planeten-Wanderweg St. Gallen- Steinach (Bodensee).

Overview During the Edo period, the ruling Tokugawa shogunate forbid the construction of many bridges for defensive reasons, and travelers even on major highways were forced to resort to fording rivers on foot or on the backs of bearers during periods of low water, or use small boats which could ferry a few travelers at a time. The Ayutaki ferry was such a ferry crossing the Abukuma River, which divided Date District from Shinobu District in southern Mutsu Province. Aside from commercial travelers, the ferry and was used by the sankin-k≈çtai processions of many of the daimy≈ç of the northern domains en route to-and-from Edo. The ferry was abolished in 1875 with the construction of a bridge over the river by the new Meiji government.

His international rugby career was curtailed by the outbreak of the Second World War but he continued to play as part of the British Army team. Personal history Davis was born in Birmingham, England, in 1913. He was educated at Camp Hill School for Boys in Birmingham, and then at Cardiff High School. He ran a tannery. With the outbreak of the Second World War Davis joined the British Army. The Who's Who of Welsh International Rugby Players states that Davis served in the Royal Artillery, but the London Gazette in 1940 lists him in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. In retirement Davis moved to Cirencester where he died circa 2002. Rugby career Davis played rugby for both Camp Hill and Cardiff High while a youth. He joined Cardiff RFC during the 1934‚Äì35 season and remained at the club until the outbreak of war.Davies (1975) p. 401 He played 119 matches for Cardiff receiving his First XV cap during the 1934‚Äì35 season when he represented the club 15 times.Davies (1975) p. 97 In the 1938‚Äì39 season, he was Cardiff's vice captain, under Wilf Wooler.Davies (1975) p. 102 As well as Cardiff, Davis also played for local rivals Penarth RFC and Cardiff High School Old Boys. In 1939 Davis was selected to play for his first international match for Wales. His inaugural game was against England in the 1939 Home Nations Championship. Although Wales lost the opening game, Davis was on the winning side for both of the tournament's remaining matches against Scotland and Ireland. Although the outbreak of the Second World War brought a close to international rugby, Davis continued to play, most often in charity war matches. In 1940 was chosen to represent the British Army, playing against France, and scored a rare try in a heavy 36‚Äì3 victory over the French. As well as the Army team, Davis also played for touring invitational team the Barbarians. His first match for the Barbarians was before the war, playing against the East Midlands county team. He would play a further four matches for the team, all wartime charity matches between 1941 and 1943, against Thorneloe's XV (named after Leicester secretary J.E. Thorneloe who organised the games). After retiring from playing rugby Davis worked as a summariser for the Welsh Home Service during the 1950s. =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), p. 472. * 1939 * 1939 * 1939  Bibliography   References  1913 births 2002 deaths Cardiff RFC players Penarth RFC players Barbarian F.C. players Sportspeople from Cardiff Rugby union props British Army personnel of World War II Wales international rugby union players English rugby union players People educated at King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Boys Royal Artillery personnel Royal Welch Fusiliers soldiers ","title":"Wendy Davis (rugby player)"},{"id":"59144337","text":"The Kursk electoral district () was a constituency created for the 1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election.

History  The graph utility, written by Douglas McIlroy, was present in the first version of Unix, and every later version, for instance: * Unix Version 7, released in 1979 * SunOS 5.10, the Solaris version released in 2005 Its output is a sequence of commands for the plot utility, which creates plots using ASCII graphics. This design demonstrates the Unix philosophy: defining the plot (graph) and drawing it (plot) are separate tools, so they can be recombined with other tools. For instance, plot can be substituted with a different utility, that accepts the same plot commands, but creates the plot in a graphics file format, or sends it to a plotter. Unix v7 also provided device drivers for plotting the results to various graphics devices; this was announced as now standard. The GNU plotutils package provides a free non- exact reimplementation, available for Linux and many other systems. It can create plots in various graphics formats.  Usage  In its simplest use, the graph utility takes a textfile containing pairs of numbers, indicating the points of a line plot. It outputs the line plot. Several options can be supplied to modify its behavior.

On 1 March 2004, the two regional television channels of RBB ‚Äì RBB Brandenburg and RBB Berlin ‚Äì were integrated into the new rbb Fernsehen. History The programme was launched on 1 January 1992 under the name Fernsehen Brandenburg. In the initial build- up phase, the then ARD cultural television programme Eins Plus was taken over from 3 p.m. to 5.15 p.m. and after 9 pm, and for cost reasons there were initially only a few programmes of its own in the programme. For example, the fact that the news programme was broadcast at 8:45 p.m. and the Brandenburg Journal at 7 p.m. was unusual for viewers in Brandenburg. Especially after the fall of communism, many East Germans had oriented themselves to the beginning time of the main news programme of Deutscher Fernsehfunk (DFF) at 7:30 pm. In general, the cooperation with Eins Plus did not lead to any high viewer acceptance. This was soon followed by a programme reform on 1 May 1992. The main news programme Brandenburg aktuell received its slot at 7:30 pm, which is still valid today in the rbb Fernsehen programme. Later, further programmes with a regional character were added to the programme, such as the popular live programme with local audience participation. The ORB Aquarium was broadcast in the night programme from 1992 to 2004. Beginning in July 1993, the station cooperated for several years with N3, the third television channel of Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) and Radio Bremen (RB) in the daytime programme.Chronik der ARD: N3 und Fernsehen Brandenburg mit gemeinsamem Tagesprogramm One of the formats that has received a lot of attention and that still exists today at the RBB is Kowalski trifft Schmidt, a German-Polish programme that was created by Germans and Poles for mutual understanding. The programme, hosted by Ola Rosiak and Max Ruppert, was awarded the German-Polish journalism award in 2001 (hosted at the time by Anna Posnanska and Fabian Maier). From 1 January 1998, the programme was broadcast in analogue form via the Astra 1B satellite and could thus be received throughout Europe. From May 2003 (merger of SFB and ORB to RBB) until the end of March 2004, the programme was broadcast under the name RBB Brandenburg.

Biography  Quaglini was born in 1957 in Mezzanino, near Broni in the Oltrep√≤ Pavese. After graduating as an accountant in Pavia, at 19 she ran away from home to live between Como and Lodi, working occasionally as a cashier, caregiver and cleaning lady. She married and had a son, but her husband became seriously ill with fulminant diabetes and died, causing her to fall into a depression that would accompany her throughout her life, also beginning to drink. Quaglini moved to live in Travac√≤ Siccomario, and after finding a job in San Martino Siccomario, she met Mario Fogli, who would become her second husband. He proved to be an obsessive, closed and jealous alcoholic who occasionally worked as a truck driver. Both Mario and Milena were also activists for the Lega Nord.Milena, the woman who killed violent men Quaglini had two sons from him, but when the bailiffs arrived at their house for an attachment of assets because of the husband's debts, she decided to separate from him and move to Este, with her second daughter. In Veneto, she worked as a concierge for a gym. The money wasn't enough, so Quaglini found work as a caregiver for an elderly gentleman, 83-year-old Giusto Dalla Pozza, who lent her 4 million lires and then tried to blackmail her. On October 25, 1995, Dalla Pozza told Milena that she could repay him 500,000 lires for a month or pay him in another way. When she refused, he tried to rape her. A scuffle broke out, in which Quaglini struck him on the head with a lamp. She then left the house and left the agonized Dalla Pozza, who was still alive, calling an ambulance. He died ten days later. Milena was accused of this murder, and instead was filed as an accidental fall until her confession. For this reason she was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment due to excessive legitimate defense. Quaglini returned to Broni in attempt to reconcile with her former husband Mario Fogli; but the quarrels started again, with Milena returning to drinking and taking antidepressants. On August 2, 1998, after another quarrel, in a state of strong drunkenness, she killed her husband: she waited for him to fall asleep, put the two girls in bed, then snatched a rope from a shutter and wrapped it around Mario's neck to scare him. This resulted in a scuffle in which Fogli tried in vain to overwhelm her. Quaglini hit him with jewelry box and then strangled him with the shutter rope. She then wrapped her husband's body in the bloodstained blankets and then in a carpet, which she put on the balcony. At 4 PM, she called the Carabinieri of Stradella, saying she had killed her husband: the Carabinieri kept her on the phone while she told them the address. After she gave the phone to her daughters, they said with certainty that the carpet with the body was on the balcony. Milena was arrested, and for this murder was sentenced to 6 years and 8 months, also selling her house because her sentence was reduced due to her semi-insanity. Quaglini was sent to a recovery community for alcoholics, but after a few months she started drinking again. She was taken into a new community, where she met -ex-carabiniere named Salvatore who offered her hospitality, but tried to rape her two days later. Quaglini met Angelo Porrello through an announcement. On October 5, 1999, she killed him in his home in Bascap√® after he told her to dress provocatively, which she refused to do. He then slapped her, and proceeded to rape her three times. After the situation subsided, in the early afternoon she prepared a coffee for him, dissolving 20 tranquilizer tablets into it. Porrello fell asleep, and then Milena moved his body into the bathtub, filling it with water. She returned a few hours later to check on him, and he had drowned. In the evening, she moved the corpse to the garden. Drugs found in the home and DNA traces brought her to confess, after Quaglini was arrested in Porrello's car and returned to prison. On October 20, two weeks after the murder, the corpse was discovered in an advanced stage of decomposition.Biography of Milena Quaglini Condemned to serve her sentence in the Vigevano Prison, Quaglini tried to overcome her depression by resuming her passion for painting, but she eventually hanged herself with a bed sheet on October 16, 2001. She found still alive by a guard at 1:50 AM, but she died in the Emergency Room at 2:15 AM. The story of Milena Quaglini had a dedicated episode on La linea d'ombra with Massimo Picozzi on Rai 2, where her story was compared to that of American serial killer Aileen WuornosThe Shadow Line Episode on YouTube, a prostitute who killed seven clients in Florida. In March 2015, Sky Crime dedicated the first episode of Profondo Nero with Carlo Lucarelli to the story of Milena Quaglini. On April 7, 2016, Rai 3 aired the fourth episode of the fourth season of Black Stars conceived and conducted by Marco Marra, dedicated to Milena Quaglini.

Kosarev, A.A. Zvezdov, V.V. Tarakanov and V.S. Gorshkov as some of its candidates. The Omsk Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies appealed to workers and peasants to vote for the Bolshevik list. Bolshevik agitations called for established of soviet power whilst campaigning for the Constituent Assembly ballot.

Ishmaev broke away. However, even after the departure of the leftists the SRs suffered internal divisions. On October 17, 1917 the West Siberian Soviet of Peasants Deputies Executive Committee held a meeting and decided to field the right-wing SR leader P. Derber as candidate for the Constituent Assembly election. But a group of right-wing SRs in the Omsk Provincial SR Party Council opposed Derber's candidature, arguing that his moral standing was questionable. The West Siberian Soviet of Peasants Deputies received a major financial boost from the Ministry of Education, which provided some 3 million Russian rubles for anti-Bolshevik agitation in the lead up to the vote.

It was built for Thomas Playfair during 1882. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  William Davis's tenements extended across the land granted to him in 1836. His Town grant of 12 perches on 29 October 1843 remained vacant except for houses to the rear of the property. Davis erected a shop to the George Street frontage of north corner of his 1836 Town grant in . This brick walled and shingle roofed shop was added to in 1842 by a similar building to the northern side (extending into land grant of 1834) In 1845 the Sydney Municipal Rate Books described the two single storey shops as having two rooms and the northern premises boundaries being wide and deep (no. 123) and the other (No. 125) being wide and deep. Both shops were \\"in bad repair\\". The tenements to the rear of 123 were described in 1863 as \\"old, ruinous and unhealthy\\". Davis's will of 1843 gave J. Edwards the title to property of the 1834 grant plus part of the 1836 grant. J Edwards conveyed the property to Henry Byrns in 1863. In 1870 W. Hooper, a greengrocer occupied No.123 and T. Barry, bootmaker occupied No.125. The shops continued as a greengrocer, J. Paddon and a bootmaker, J. McAuley, until September 1881 when they and the rear buildings were pulled down. Thomas Playfair purchased the properties from H. Byrns and in 1882 erected two two-storey four roomed shops out of brick and stone walls and iron roof on the sites of No. 123 and 125. J. Paddon continued as a fruiterer in the new shop No. 123 and C. W. Danielson, bootmaker in the other. Shop No. 125 became an outfitter and importer outlet in 1885.

Heritage listing  As at 31 March 2011, this pair of shops and residence and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. Numbers 123 to 125 are associated with Thomas Playfair, Mayor of Sydney in 1885. Playfair was involved in the profitable marine trade and invested in property in the local area, of which 121 George Street is one such property. Significant aspects of the building include the architectural form and detail including the original/recreated shopfronts. Internally, the remaining original layout and other features including joinery, fireplaces and stairs etc. which contribute to the significance of the pair. Shop and Residence was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. This pair of shops and residence and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. Numbers 123 to 125 George Street were built in 1882 as commercial premises as part of the business precinct lining the harbour-side of The Rocks, and are associated with the evolving pattern of urban fabric in the area. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Numbers 123 to 125 are associated with Thomas Playfair, Mayor of Sydney in 1885. Playfair was involved in the profitable marine trade and invested in property in the local area, of which 121 George Street is one such property. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The buildings' facades are fine examples of the Victorian Free Classical style, executed to give a sense of decorum to what would otherwise have been simple commercial / residential structures. The buildings have streetscape value as two buildings in a group of three that were designed to appear as one property. The buildings' scale and alignment to the street are typical of that found along the business precinct of George Street in The Rocks area. The street fa√ßades have remained relatively intact since they were constructed in 1882. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The buildings have had a continuous commercial use since they were built in 1882. They have been used as fruit shops, ham and beef shops, smallgoods shops, a wine depot, a bookmaker's, importers' offices, outfitters, and, in 1933, No 123 was used by a pest extermination company. The site retains elements of combined shops and residences, once common throughout both The Rocks and Sydney in general. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The fabric, although somewhat modified, has the ability to yield information on the configuration of late Victorian commercial/residential buildings and aspects of the way of life of the people who inhabited them. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site has high potential to reveal further subsurface archaeological deposits associated with the early European occupation of the site and the surrounding area. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The buildings at 123 and 125 George street are expressive of the close weaving of the social fabric of The Rocks area in the nineteenth century, and demonstrate the close links between the residential and commercial activities of the community.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is believed to have been built during the Cholas period in the 7th century. Shiva is worshipped as Pushpavaneswarar and his consort Parvathi as Soundaranayagi. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a seven-tiered Rajagopuram, the gateway tower. The temple is located on the banks of Vaigai river. The temple is open from 6am - 1 pm and 4 - 8:30 pm on all days. Four daily rituals and four yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Vaikasi Visagam celebrated during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May - June), Aaadi Mulaikattu festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Aadi (August - September), Navaratri during the Tamil month of Purattasi (September - October) and Aipasi Kolattam festival during the Tamil month of Aipasi (October - November are the most prominent festivals celebrated in the temple for Pushpavaneswarar being the most prominent festivals. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend thumb As per Hindu legend, this is one of the 64 places where Shiva performed his Thiruvilayadal, the divine plays. A dancing girl named Ponanaial was a staunch devotee of Shiva and her only aim in life was to make an idol of Shiva made of gold. She was not able to accomplish due to lack of money. Pleased by her devotion, Shiva appeared in the form of metallurgist named Rasavathi who converted iron, bronze and aluminium to make the golden idol. Impressed by the beauty of the idol, Ponanaial pinched the cheeks of the idol, which is believed to be the mark in the idol. The lingam in the temple is believed to have been self-manifested and was worshipped by Surya, Dharmaraja, Nala, Chandra, Thirasanan, Brahma and Vishnu. Since Shiva appeared under Parijatha tree, the presiding deity came to be known as Pushpaveneswarar. Architecture Pushpavaneswarar temple is located in Thirupuvanam, a village located on the banks of Vaigai river, located from Madurai and from Sivaganga. The temple in its current structure built of stone was built by the Chola king Aditya I (870 - 907 CE). The temple has a seven-tiered Rajagopuram, the gateway tower that pierces the rectangular wall that houses all the shrines. The temple tank is located adjacent to the temple. The sanctum sanctorum houses the one of the rare image of Pushpavaneswarar in the form of Lingam, an iconic form of Shiva with three faces, said to be of the very few in India. There is an Ardha Mandapa and a Mukha mandapa, pillared halls leading to the sanctum. The first precinct has the shrines of Vinayakar, Murugan, Durga, Dakshinamurthy and Chandikeswara. The second precinct has a hundred pillared hall. History thumb The exact year of building could not be ascertained from the inscriptions, but the stone structure of Pushpavaneswarar shrine in its current form, is built during the time of Chola king Aditya I (870 - 907 CE). The inscriptions on the two sides of the Southern shrine of the temple indicate an endowment from Aditya for perpetual lighting of lamps in the temple. Theerthavari, the sacred bathing of the presiding deity during the auspicious days in the Tamil month of Puratasi (September - October). The temple has another inscription in the second precinct during the time of Uttama Chola (970-985 CE) for the maintenance and worship of Pushpavaneswarar and Varadaraja Perumal afforded to four able men. During the reign of Raja Raja Chola I (984-1015 CE), a village named Manali was gifted to the temple - the inscription indicates that the temple was built by Sembiyar Mahadevi. The structure of the Vishnu shrine is believed to have expanded during the reign of Rajendra Chola I (1012-1044). It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams. Festival thumb The temple follows Saivite tradition. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaivaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 8:30 a.m., Uchikalam at 11:30 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., and Sayarakshai between 8:00  8:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Pushpavaneswarar and Amirthambigai.There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6am - 12 pm and 4-8:30 pm. Vaikasi Visagam celebrated during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May - June), Aaadi Mulaikattu festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Aadi (August - September), Navaratri during the Tamil month of Purattasi (September - October) and Aipasi Kolattam festival during the Tamil month of Aipasi (October - November are the most prominent festivals celebrated in the temple.

There is a wish tree in the compound having Naga, a snake representation. Childless ladies pray for the attaining child by placing or installing the stone symbols praying Vakrakali. Religious significance Tirugnana Sambandar, a 7th century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated Pushpavaneswarar in ten verses each in Tevaram, compiled as the First Tirumurai. Appar, a contemporary of Sambandar, also venerated Pushpavaneswarar in 10 verses in Tevaram, compiled as the Fifth Tirumurai. The temple also finds mention in the works of Sundarar As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 275 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon.

He competed in the men's middleweight event at the 1956 Summer Olympics. He was one of the top collegiate boxers while attending Idaho State University, and later as a professional boxer, twice fought for the world light-heavyweight championship. Early life Roger Rouse was born in Anaconda, Montana (Deer Lodge County, Montana) on June 3, 1934, and grew up in an area commonly referred to as Opportunity, Montana, a few miles from Anaconda. His parents were James and Mary Rouse. Roger spent his adolescence in Opportunity, growing up with four brothers and two sisters. His father worked as a foreman at the nearby Anaconda Copper Smelter. Rouse attended Anaconda High School and was a standout athlete in both basketball and football and was awarded all- state honors in football his senior year in 1953. Roger Rouse 1953 Rouse started boxing when he was about nine years old, fighting his older brother Don, after their father gave each of them a pair of boxing gloves. Don was two years older than Roger, and regularly gave Roger a thumping. Nevertheless, Roger continued to accept his brother‚Äôs challenges to go out to the barn for some sparing. During his four years at Anaconda High School, Rouse continued to box, where his coach was Jack Lodell, the local probation officer who ran the community‚Äôs local amateur boxing program. Following high school graduation, Rouse accepted a scholarship to play football for the University of Montana. But, shortly after arriving at the University, Rouse injured his knee in practice, and was unable to play football. Changing direction, Rouse accepted a boxing scholarship at Idaho State University. In 1955, Roger Rouse married Lorena Avis Ryan on June 3, 1956, in Pocatello. Idaho. Amateur boxing career Rouse was a collegiate boxer for Idaho State University from 1953 through 1957. During his college career, Rouse compiled a record of 31 wins, 1 loss, and zero draws. In 1954, Rouse won the Golden Gloves title in Chicago , and in 1956, Rouse was crowned champion of the NCAA Tournament in the middleweight division. A year later (1957) Rouse successfully defended his collegiate crown and was awarded the John S. LaRowe Trophy as the most outstanding boxer of the NCAA tournament. Rouse's boxing style was traditional, stand-up boxer, known for his strength and stamina. Recognizing his boxing accomplishments, in 1983 Idaho State University inducted Rouse into the University‚Äôs Hall of Fame. In recognition of his impressive collegiate accomplishments, Rouse was chosen to represent the United States in the middleweight division at the 1956 Olympics held at Melbourne, Australia. Rouse was eliminated in the quarterfinals in what many observers viewed as a controversial decision, given that the French fighter that won the split decision by the judges was forced to drop out of the competition the next day due to the beating he received from Rouse. Professional boxing career In April 1958, Rouse turned pro, and agreed to be managed by Sid Flaherty, a prominent West Coast boxing manager in San Francisco & Portland. Rouse made his professional debut as a light-heavyweight at the Cow Palace in San Francisco which he won. Between 1956 and 1959, Rouse had 13 professional fights, and was undefeated. On March 11, 1960 Rouse fought for the first time at Madison Square Garden in New York City. His opponent was Harold Simmons. The six round bout ended with Simmons defeating Rouse (his first loss) in an unanimous decision by the judges. His first professional fight in his hometown of Anaconda was a matchup against Johnny Persol, a light-heavyweight contender with a record at the time of 12 wins, 1 loss, and 1 draw. Rouse won the contest with a knockout in the first round. After putting together a record of 27 wins (including 13 by KO), 5 losses, and 3 draws, including string of wins ), Rouse, now being called the ‚ÄúOpportunity Kid‚Äù was named the number-one light heavyweight contender in November 1965, and was expected to get a shot at the title in the near future. Roger Rouse 1967 However, it was two years later, in November 1967 that Rouse would get his shot at the light-heavyweight championship in Las Vegas, Nevada. He would fight Dick Tiger, at the time the world champion. Rouse and Tiger would battle for twelve rounds, until Tiger KO‚Äôd Rouse to end the fight and retain his title. Three years later (April 4, 1970), Rouse would again contend for the light-heavyweight title, this time against current title-holder Bob Foster. The 15 round championship fight was held in Missoula, Montana, about 90 minutes from Rouse‚Äôs hometown of Anaconda, Montana. Foster won the contest in the fifth round by technical knockout. The Foster fight was Rouse‚Äôs last attempt to win the light-heavyweight title. After being defeated by Foster, Rouse continued to box, but was never again a contender for the title. Rouse retired from boxing in 1972, with a professional record of 39 wins, 23 loses, and 4 draws. Later life and death After retiring from boxing. Rouse worked at the Copper Smelter in Anaconda, Montana until its closure in 1980, and was active as a boxing coach for the local Police Athletic League for several years. Roger Rouse died in Helena, Montana on March 7, 1999 of Alzheimer‚Äôs. He was survived by his wife Avis, and two sons, Bill and Cash Rouse.

After winning one minor race as a juvenile in 2003 he made steady progress in the following year. He was placed in the Prix Noailles and the Prix Hocquart and went on to win both the Prix Frederic de Lagrange and the Grand Prix de Deauville before producing his best performance when narrowly beaten in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. When transferred to Godolphin in 2005 he won the Gran Premio del Jockey Club. In 2006 he recorded further major wins in the Rheinland-Pokal and the Premio Roma. He was retired from racing at the end of the 2007 season. Background Cherry Mix was a grey horse bred by Lagardere Elevage, a company which managed the bloodstock interests of Jean- Luc Lagard√®re. Lagard√®re died in March 2003 and the colt passed into the ownership of the Lagard√®re family. He was sent into training with Andr√© Fabre. He inherited his grey coat from his sire Linamix, who won the Poule d'Essai des Poulains for Lagardere in 1990 and went on to sire the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Sagamix. Cherry Mix's dam Cherry Moon was bred in California and won four minor races from 21 starts in North America. She was descended from the American broodmare Fairy Day, making her a distant relative of the Belmont Stakes winner Summing. Racing career=2003: two-year-old season= Cherry Mix began his racing career on 28 September when he started 1.5/1 favourite in a twelve-runner maiden race over 1600 metres on soft ground at Fontainebleau Racecourse and won by half a length. Two weeks later he attempted to follow up in a minor race at Longchamp Racecourse but was beaten a neck into second place by Barnacle. =2004: three-year-old season= Cherry Mix's second season began when he finished third when favourite for the Listed Prix Maurice Caillault over 2100 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 18 March. He then ran second to Voix du Nord in the Prix Noailles at Longchamp in April and third behind Lord du Sud in the Prix Hocquart at the same track in May. On 4 July he started odds-on favourite for the Listed Prix Auriban at Saint-Cloud but was beaten a neck by Staramix. Twenty days later the colt was made 1.6/1 favourite against eight opponents for the Listed Prix Frederic de Lagrange over 2400 metres at Vichy. Ridden by Thierry Gillet he tracked the front- running Anabaa Republic before taking the lead 400 metres from the finish and ran on well to win by three lengths. Gillet was again in the saddle when Cherry Mix was stepped back up to Group 2 level and matched against older horses in the Grand Prix de Deauville over 2500 metres on heavy ground at Deauville Racecourse on 29 August. He started at odds of 8/1 in an eight- runner field which included Fair Mix (Prix Ganay), Martaline (Prix Maurice de Nieuil) and Bailador (Grand Prix de Vichy). After racing towards the rear, Cherry Mix went to the front 200 metres out and drew away from his opponents to win by four lengths from Martaline. On 3 October at Longchamp, Cherry Mix, ridden by Christophe Soumillon started a 33/1 outsider for the 2004 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He was always in contention, took the lead in the straight and looked likely to record an upset victory as he opened up a two length advantage. In the final 50 metres however, he was run down by Bago and beaten half a length into second place. The horses finishing behind him included Ouija Board, North Light, Tap Dance City, Warrsan, Blue Canari, Pride and Grey Swallow. In the 2004 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, Cherry Mix was given a rating of 125, five pounds the leader Ghostzapper, making him the sixth best racehorse in the world. =2005: four-year-old season= Before the start of the 2005 season Cherry Mix was acquired by Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation and was transferred to the stable of Saeed bin Suroor. He was ridden all of his races as a four-year-old by Frankie Dettori. Cherry Mix began his campaign with two unsuccessful starts at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse in Dubai. He ran fourth in the third round of the Al Maktoum Challenge on 5 March and came home unplaced behind Phoenix Reach in the Sheema Classic three weeks later. After an absence of more than five months Cherry Mix returned to the track in Germany on 4 September when he was made favourite for the Grosser Preis von Baden but finished fifth of the nine runners behind Warrsan. Starting a 28/1 outsider in his second bid to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on 2 October he reached second place in the straight before fading badly and coming home twelfth behind Hurricane Run. Two weeks after his failure at Longchamp the colt was sent to Italy and started the 1.6/1 favourite for the Gran Premio del Jockey Club over 2400 metres at San Siro Racecourse in Milan. He went to the front after 800 metres and drew away in the straight to win \\"comfortably\\" by two lengths from the German colt Salutino. On his final run of 2005 Cherry Mix was shipped to Sha Tin Racecourse to contest the Hong Kong Vase on 11 December. He raced in second place for most of the way but dropped away in the straight and came home ninth of the twelve runners behind Ouija Board. In the 2005 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings Cherry Mix was rated 113 in the world with a rating of 115. =2006: five-year-old season= Cherry Mix began his 2006 season in Dubai, finishing unplaced in the Dubai City of Gold on 2 March. On returning to Europe he was unplaced in the Yorkshire Cup in May and then finished last of the six runners behind Hurricane Run in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot Racecourse in July. He was then sent to Germany for the Group 1 Rheinland-Pokal at Cologne on 13 August and started the 3.8/1 third choice in the betting behind Collier Hill and the Hansa-Preis winner Egerton. Ridden by the Australian jockey Kerrin McEvoy he tracked the front-running Academy Reward as the pair opened up a lead of eight lengths on the field. He passed the pacemaker 400 metres from the finish and maintained his advantage to win by four lengths from Fracas. In the International Stakes nine days later at York Racecourse he made most of the running but faded in the last quarter mile and finished sixth of the seven runners behind Notnowcato. For his last two races of 2006 Cherry Mix was campaigned in Italy again. On 15 October he attempted to repeat his 2005 success in the Gran Premio del Jockey Club but after leading for most of the way he was overtaken approaching the last 200 metres and finished third behind Laverock and Fair Nashwan. At Capannelle Racecourse in Rome over 2000 metres on 5 November the horse was ridden by Ted Durcan and started at odds of 3.4/1 in a ten-runner field for the Premio Roma. The German horse Soldier Hollow, winner of the race for the last two years started favourite, while the other runners included Fair Nashwan, Distant Way (Premio Presidente della Repubblica), Emily Bronte (Prix des R√©servoirs) and Hattan (Chester Vase). Cherry Mix led from the start and was never seriously challenged, coming home four lengths clear of Hattan. =2007: six-year-old season= Cherry Mix returned as a six-year-old in 2007 but failed to win or place in three races. He finished fourth to Distant Way in the Premio Presidente della Repubblica at Rome in May and was then stepped up in distance a month later for the Ascot Gold Cup in which he came home eighth behind Yeats. After a break of over four months he returned for the Premio Roma on 4 November and finished fourth behind the British-trained four-year-old Pressing.

In 1908 he was elected to the Legislative Council in the Levuka constituency, defeating the incumbent David Robbie. He was re-elected in 1911, again defeating Robbie. Prior to the 1914 elections, the constituency was reorganised and renamed Eastern. Maynard Hedstrom was returned unopposed and held the seat until the 1937 elections; during this time he was returned unopposed again in 1917, after which he became a member of the Executive Council. He was returned unopposed in 1920, 1929, 1932 and only faced opponents in 1923 and 1926, winning easily on both occasions. He did not contest a seat in the 1937 elections, at which point he also left the Executive Council, but was chosen as one of the two nominated European members on the Legislative Council.

The treaty was facilitated by Russian ambassador Artemy Volynsky and Safavid Grand Vizier Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani. Incumbent Tsar Peter I (1682‚Äì1725) ratified the treaty in July 1719. His Iranian counterpart, King (Shah) Sultan Husayn (1694‚Äì1722), ratified it in 1720. It was the first formal bilateral agreement between Iran and Russia. However, at the time of its signing, Iran was in a state of great unrest and therefore its terms were \\"widely disregarded and ignored\\". Rudi Matthee noted: \\"The massive unrest in Iran that followed shortly made practical implementation utterly impossible.\\" A few years later, in 1722, when the Safavid state had already entered the final stages of collapse, Russia used the treaty combination with the deaths of Russian merchants in the 1721 sack of Shamakhi as the casus belli to invade Iran. Background By the first decade of the 18th century, the once-prosperous Safavid realm was in a state of serious decline, with insurrections in numerous parts of its domains. The king, Sultan Husayn, was a weak ruler, and although personally inclined to be more humane, flexible, and relaxed than his chief mullah, he went along with the recommendations of his advisers regarding important state decisions. He reigned as a \\"stationary monarch\\", preferring, apart from the occasional hunting party, to be inside or near the capital of Isfahan at all times, invisible to all \\"but the most intimate of courtiers\\". Having seen not much more of the world than the harem walls, he had quickly fallen under the spell of the leading ulama, most notably Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi. Many of the ambitious Russian ruler Peter the Great's (Peter I) political ambitions were aimed at Iran. One of these was to have full control over Iranian silk exports. Russian rulers before Peter I had tried to spark Iranian interest in exporting Iranian silk to Europe through Russia. Though official orders were issued by Russian rulers to benefit the Safavid Empire's Armenian merchants, they were ineffective. The Armenians continued to carry their silk to Europe through the Ottoman Empire rather than through Russia. In 1711, Peter I decided to issue additional privileges for Safavid merchants, but as with previous Russian efforts they failed to achieve their objective. Embassy Realizing that his efforts had been in vain, Peter I decided to appoint Artemy Volynsky as his new ambassador to Iran in 1715. He tasked Volynsky with gathering information about Iran's military strength, silk producing provinces, and the nation's main agricultural and mineral resources. He was to convince the Iranian King of the advantages of the Russia-trade route over the Ottoman route and to spark his interest in an agreement which would benefit the Russia trade route. Volynsky had to stipulate that to facilitate such an idea, Russian merchants had to be free of obstacles within Iran. In relation to that, he was ordered to mention that Russian merchants were the victim of local Safavid governors, who \\"confiscated their goods without payment\\", and suffered from \\"intrigues\\" by Safavid merchants, especially those from New Julfa (the Armenian quarter of Isfahan). Furthermore, he had to stipulate that Daghestani robbers and bandits targeted Russian merchants, and a number of them had been taken captive in the past. Lastly, he had to demand the Iranian government put pressure on Armenian traders from New Julfa \\"to honor their commitment\\" in relation to the privileges already given to them by Russia. Volynsky departed from Saint Petersburg in 1715, reached Astrakhan after a year, and arrived in Niazabad in the autumn of 1716. He arrived in Isfahan six months later as he was \\"held up\\" in Shamakhi and Tabriz with \\"quasi-autonomous local officials\\". According to his own writings, the treatment he received in the royal capital was \\"little better\\". He became embroiled in disagreements about protocol as he had asked whether he could \\"follow the Russian custom of riding his horse all the way to the Shah's quarters and whether he would be able to hand his credentials to the Safavid ruler in person and in full regalia\\". During his stay in Iran, Volynsky reportedly became the target of \\"endless humiliations\\", for, as Matthee notes, the Iranians had \\"long despised Russians for their uncouthness\\". The negotiations were conducted between Volynsky and Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani, the Iranian Grand Vizier. Fears of Russian military plans grew acute at the same time when it was discovered the Russians, as part of the Bekovich-Cherkassky mission, had recently built fortifications on the eastern littoral of the Caspian Sea. Rumors were spread that Russian ships had been spotted near Gilan. Suspicious of these developments, the Iranians questioned Volynsky about these matters, and Russia's intentions. Concluding that Volynsky was a spy, and concerned that a long stay in Isfahan could allow him \\"to gain a full picture of Iran's lamentable military state\\" negotiations were kept short. Some of Volynsky's requests were declined. In line with policy held since the 1640s, Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani rejected the Russian request to form an anti-Ottoman alliance. The Grand Vizier declined Volynsky's request for \\"retroactive compensation\\" for the economic losses of some of the Russian merchants in the past. But the Vizier did promise protection for Russian merchants in future. Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani stated that the Lezgins were Safavid subjects. Since they did not obey Safavid laws the state was not responsible for past issues with the Lezgins. Fath-Ali Khan also declined Volynsky's spurious requests to grand special rights to the Russian silk merchants and to find a \\"more accommodating harbor than Niazabad\\". According to Fath-Ali Khan, granting the Russian merchants special privileges would make it less likely merchants from the Ottoman Empire and other nations would come to Iran. A different harbor would entail only benefits for Russia. Matthee adds that the Iranians \\"no doubt\\" feared a possible Russian \\"strategic interest in a new harbor\\". Despite the tough talks, Volynsky and Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani concluded an agreement in late July 1717. Terms According to the terms of the treaty: # Russia was allowed to conduct trade in all parts of the Safavid Empire. # Iran promised to guarantee and ensure the protection of Russian nationals within the Safavid Empire against thieves and bandits. # Russian merchants were allowed to purchase silk in Gilan and Mazandaran. # Iran promised to safeguard convoys of Russian merchants travelling between Shamakhi and Niazabad, which was considered to be an unsafe road. # Russia was allowed to establish a consulate in Isfahan (and later in Gilan), thus stationing resident Russian consuls and vice-consuls in Iran (effected in 1720). Assessment and aftermath At the time the treaty was signed, Iran was in a state of great unrest, and therefore its terms were \\"widely disregarded and ignored\\". Prof. Rudi Matthee notes: \\"The massive unrest in Iran that followed shortly made practical implementation utterly impossible.\\" Though the Iranians tried to prevent Volynsky from staying for too long in Iran, he managed to gather the information Peter I had asked him to collect. He had noticed the serious decline of the state and in 1717‚Äì1718 Volynsky reported to Peter I \\"the country was extremely weak and an easy target for an outside power\\". In the words of Matthee: \\"Drawing attention to what he [Volynsky] saw as the inability of the military to defend Iran against domestic rebels and outside aggressors, he presciently foresaw the destruction of the Safavid state.\\" The treaty is considered important in the history of relations between Iran and Russia, for it was the first formal bilateral agreement between the two countries. It also resulted in a large influx of Russian merchants into Iranian commercial markets. The establishment of a resident Russian consul was also important. It was a special right granted to the Russians, and the consul's role in subsequent events stipulated his importance to the regulation of relations between the two countries (in particular in defending the interests of the Russian merchants within Iran). The consul later received vice-consuls who were stationed in other towns in the Safavid Empire (such as in Shamakhi), who were to facilitate Russia's political goals. No provision included the Safavid Armenian merchants and the silk route they used. According to Matttee, Armenian \\"scheming\\" against Volynsky may have prevented this, for the powerful New Julfan Armenian trade monopoly wanted to \\"safeguard\\" their Anatolia route. According to Volynsky, Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani told him \\"he would be unable to force the Armenians to transport all their wares via Russia\\". Four years after the signing of the treaty, in 1721, the Safavid city of Shamakhi was sacked and looted by Lezgin rebels. Volynsky reported to Peter the Great on the considerable harm done to the Russian merchants and their livelihoods. The report stipulated that the 1721 event was a clear violation of the 1717 Russo‚ÄìIranian trade treaty, by which the latter had guaranteed to protect Russian nationals within the Safavid domains. With the Safavid realm in chaos, and the Safavid ruler unable to fulfill the provisions of the treaty, Volynsky urged Peter to take advantage of the situation and to invade Iran on the pretext of restoring order as an ally of the Safavid king. Shortly afterward, Russia used the attack on its merchants in Shamakhi as a pretext to launch the Russo-Persian War of 1722‚Äì1723. The episode brought trade between Iran and Russia to a standstill, and made the city of Astrakhan the terminus for the Volga trade route. By the end of the Zand era (late 18th century), the 1717 treaty became the reference point for all future agreements between Russia and Iran. \\"[T]wo paragraphs from it (concerning the residence of the Russian consul in Iran and free trade of Russians) were included in all subsequent contracts\\".

He is best known for promoting the use of gutta-percha in Europe. This material was an important natural rubber that made submarine telegraph cables possible. Montgomerie was involved in spice cultivation as head of the Singapore botanical experimental gardens and at his personal estate in Singapore. The latter never became economically viable, but he received a Society of Arts gold medal for nutmeg cultivation. He was also responsible for building the first lunatic asylum in Singapore. Montgomerie died at Barrackpore in India a few years after taking part in the Second Anglo-Burmese War as Superintendent Surgeon.  Early life and family  Montgomerie was born in Scotland in 1797.Savage & Yeoh, p. 106 In 1827, he married Elizabeth Graham in Calcutta.Teo, p. 25 A son is mentioned in a newspaper article.Buckley, p. 402 His brother was Major-General Sir P. Montgomerie of the Madras Artillery who fought in the First Opium War.Buckley, p. 402  Career  In 1818, Montgomerie became a medical officer with the East India Company and was posted to India. In May 1819, he was posted to Singapore with the 2nd Battalion of the 20th Regiment of Bengal Native InfantryBuckley, p. 60 with the rank of Assistant Surgeon.The term \\"surgeon\\" was used by the military Indian Medical Service to designate a medical officer's rank. It did not indicate whether or not the officer practiced surgery. Surgeon ranks, in order of descending seniority were; Surgeon-Major, Surgeon, Assistant Surgeon, Sub-assistant Surgeon (Teo, p. 25). Upon his arrival, he took over as senior surgeon of Singapore from a more junior officer, and was given the rank of acting Surgeon. In 1827, Montgomerie was posted back to Bengal. In 1835, the medical department headquarters was moved from Penang to Singapore, whereupon Montgomerie was made the head. He retired to England in January 1844. He was recalled to Bengal some years later as Garrison Surgeon at Fort William, Calcutta, and was Superintendent Surgeon in the field during the Second Anglo-Burmese War (1852‚Äì1853). He died of cholera at Barrackpore,\\"William Montgomerie\\", HistorySG India, on 21 March 1856 and was buried in Fort William. While he was stationed at Singapore, Montgomerie was usually the doctor attending Singapore's leaders. These included Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore, and William Farquhar, who was stabbed by a would-be assassin in 1823. Farquhar had expressed concern over Montgomerie's youth when he arrived in Singapore in 1819. Montgomerie was very young at this point, even younger than the Sub-assistant Surgeon from whom he took over and was now in charge.Teo, p. 25 If anything happened to Farquhar, Montgomerie would have been left in charge of Singapore as the next most senior official. Farquhar wrote to Calcutta asking them to put alternative arrangements in place.Buckley, p. 56 In Singapore, Montgomerie was appointed a magistrate in 1819, head of the botanical experimental gardens in 1823 (where he concentrated on cultivating spicesBuckley, p. 196), and sheriff in 1837.  Agriculture  Montgomerie keenly pursued agriculture in Singapore. He owned the Duxton Hill estate for most of his time there, but never succeeded in making it profitable. It was sold after his death and briefly renamed \\"Woodsville\\". The area is now built-up and the name has reverted to Duxton Hill, a name also preserved in Duxton Road. The primary crop grown was sugar, but later he planted nutmeg trees. The estate was bounded by a river where Montgomerie had a large watermill. A short distance from the mill, the Serangoon Road crosses the river on a crossing known as Montgomerie's Bridge. = Spice cultivation = On his return to Singapore in 1835, Montgomerie found that the government spice plantations had been neglected. The clove crop had been destroyed by blight, but since the nutmeg trees still looked healthy, Montgomerie decided to start his own plantation with seeds procured from Penang.RSA Transactions, p. 40 He believed that enough nutmeg could be grown in Singapore to supply the entire British Empire by 1850, and that the price could be driven down to something affordable by ordinary people. However, he complained that the government land leasing arrangements were not favourable in Singapore, and discouraged farming. He compared this to Ceylon (now known as Sri Lanka, but at the time a British possession) where land could be bought outright.RSA Transactions, pp. 45‚Äì47 In 1842, Montgomerie sent a box of nutmeg and mace to the Society of Arts (later to become the Royal Society) for which he was awarded a gold medal.RSA Transactions, pp. 38, 48  Gutta-percha  Gutta-percha is a natural rubber obtained from the sap of certain trees growing in the Far East. It hardens on exposure to air, but has the useful property of being thermoplastic. It can be moulded to a new shape after boiling in water and will reharden when cool. It is credited with being the first plastic available to manufacturing industry. Montgomerie is sometimes credited with discovering the substance. He is responsible for it coming into widespread use, but it had in fact been known for some time by a few natives who used it to make handles for parangs (Malayan machetes) and other items. However, it was not widely known, even amongst native Malays. Montgomerie said that most people he showed it to could not recognise it. It had even made its way to Europe,As early as 1656, John Tradescant had brought a material to England which he called mazer wood and which is thought to be gutta-percha because of the similarity in its properties (Straits Times, 1884; Baker, p. 89). Jos√© d'Almeida, a Portuguese doctor and trader in Singapore, also brought samples to the Society of Arts around the same time as Montgomerie after seeing native whips made from the material (Oxley, p. 22). but again, was not widely known.Straits Times, 1884 Montgomerie's discovery began in 1822 when he was shown a different natural rubber, gutta girek, and was told of the existence of a harder material, gutta percha. However, he could not obtain a sample at the time and did not get another opportunity until 1842 after he returned to Singapore. In that year a Malay showed him a parang with a gutta- percha handle. Montgomerie purchased the item and requested that more of the substance be provided. After experimentation, he concluded that its thermoplastic properties would be ideal for making many surgical instruments. The natural rubbers used for this purpose at the time were easily damaged by solvents and could not withstand the tropical climate. Montgomerie sent samples to the Calcutta Medical Board with a recommendation for its medical use. The board agreed with him and requested that he obtain as much as possible.Montgomerie, p. 378 Montgomerie also sent samples to the Royal Asiatic Society in London in 1843. He began an investigation into how widespread the tree was. He discovered that it was not only found in Singapore, but all over the Malaysian peninsular and the islands of Indonesia and appeared to be plentiful. However, as early as 1846 Montgomerie was expressing fears that supplies would dry up due to the destructive method of harvesting and large quantities being produced.Oxley also noted the fast depopulation of gutta-percha trees in Singapore (Oxley, p. 24) Trees were cut down and the bark stripped to get to the sap. Montgomerie believed that it was possible to harvest the sap by tapping but did not think it would be possible to persuade the native collectors to use this slower, but more sustainable method.Montgomerie, pp. 378‚Äì379 Besides its use for making medical instruments, Montgomerie proposed several other uses, including as a dental filling (for which it is still used).Montgomerie, p. 379 Numerous other applications were quickly found for the new material, including a much improved golf ball.\\"Gutta Percha\\", PHS However, the most important application was as an electrical insulator. This was essential for the worldwide telegraph network as it made possible the transatlantic telegraph cable and other links across oceans. No better material was available until the invention of polyethylene in the 1930s.  Mental health medicine  It was the custom in Singapore to house 'lunatics' in the jail. Natives and Chinese were confined in this way, while Europeans enjoyed better treatment. It was part of Montgomerie's duties to visit the jail daily to attend to their needs. There had been public disquiet about the lack of proper facilities, but nothing was done until 1840 when one mentally ill inmate murdered another. Montgomerie was tasked with investigating and making recommendations. He recommended a purpose built lunatic asylum and submitted plans and costings. He rejected an alternative idea of sending patients to India. Montgomerie's plan was accepted and the asylum was built.Lee, pp. 386‚Äì387  Singapore Stone  Montgomerie played a minor role in recovering pieces of the Singapore Stone after it was demolished by explosives in 1843.Miksic, p. 19 The stone was a large rock in the Singapore River bearing an ancient and undeciphered inscription. It was destroyed by the Settlement Engineer to clear the river channel. Montgomerie had intended to set up a Singapore museum, but was unable to do so. Instead, he sent the pieces he recovered to the Asiatic Society museum in Calcutta around 1848.Buckley, pp. 91‚Äì94 In 1918, some of the fragments recovered by Montgomerie were returned to Singapore on extended loan and are now in the National Museum of Singapore.Brooke, p. 576 The destruction of the stone horrified many of the colony's officials. One described it as vandalism. The stone was first discovered by Bengali sailors tasked with clearing the vegetation by the port's first Master Attendant. On seeing the strange inscription, they refused to carry on. Montgomerie commented \\"it was a pity that those who afterwards authorised the destruction of the ancient relic were not themselves prevented by some such wholesome superstition.\\"Buckley, pp. 93‚Äì94  Honours  * Society of Arts Gold Medal 1844.Montgomerie, p. 378Oxley, and several other sources, say that Montgomerie got the medal for the discovery of gutta-percha (Oxley, p. 22). This may be an error since the RSA citation flatly contradicts this. The alternative explanation that there were two different medals awarded is not found in any source of this article. If it is an error, Montgomerie himself was under the same misapprehension, since he also says he got the medal for gutta-percha (Montgomerie, p. 378). It is entirely possible that Montgomerie misunderstood the award. He was in Singapore at the time, and the award was collected on his behalf by his brother-in-law, H. Gouger, in London (RSA Transactions, p. 60). In the age before the establishment of the worldwide telegraph, communications were slow and unreliable.

He was part of a commission studying the transmission of influenza within army camps, which was a significant problem at the time. He spent 20 months working with Major Russell Cecil at the Army Medical School, primarily on the production and prevention of bacterial pneumonia in monkeys, the end result being a series of ten papers in the Journal of Experimental Medicine. In 1921, he became the John Slade Ely Professor of Medicine at Yale, where he was named Sterling Professor of Medicine in 1927. At the time of his appointment, he was one of the youngest full professors of medicine in Yale's history. He was dean of Yale's medical school from 1940 until 1947. He was the physician-in-chief of Yale-New Haven Hospital for more than thirty years, from 1921 until his death in 1952. He performed significant research in epidemic diseases and some of the first laboratory and clinical tests on penicillin. He was the doctoral advisor of Thomas Francis Jr., who in turn was the advisor of Jonas Salk. Blake joined the American Association of Immunologists in 1921 and served as its president from 1934-5, after which he was one of its councillors from 1935-9. He was part of the board of editors of The Journal of Immunology from 1936-42, and an associate editor from 1943-52.  Honors and awards  Blake received numerous honors over the course of his career, including the Charles V. Chapin Award (1945), U.S. Typhus Commission Medal (1945), and Medal for Merit (1946).

The group shot to prominence with its interactive Rain Room art installation. Random International creates art installations that investigate notions of human consciousness, perception and instinct. Its work, which includes sculpture, performance and large-scale architectural installations, reflects the relationship between human and machine and centres on audience interaction. Two of its exhibition pieces have now become permanent installations, the first of which was the critically acclaimed and popular Rain Room, now permanently housed in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates (UAE). The group was founded in 2005 by German artists Hannes Koch and Florian Ortkrass. Ortkrass graduated from the Royal College of Art in London in 2005, while Koch graduated in 2004. Its relentless experimentation with digital technologies and reflections of the human form has led it to collaborate with Harvard roboticists on creating 'point studies' that reduce representation of the human form in motion into 15 light points, as well as with architects to create large scale public displays that include covering a German train station with LED lights.  Rain Room  Rain Room, now installed in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, was the first installation of a Random International project in a purpose-built, permanent structure. The work was previously shown at the Barbican, London (2012); MoMA, New York (2013); Yuz Museum, Shanghai (2015) and LACMA, Los Angeles (2015‚Äì2017). Rain Room allows visitors to the installation to walk through a downpour without getting wet. Motion sensors detect visitors' movements as they navigate through the darkened space, becoming \\"performers in this intersection of art, technology and nature\\". The work has been a celebrated Instagram theme: the photo and video sharing platform has been cited as a major source of Random International's popular recognition. In 2015, billionaire Budi Tek, Yuz Museum's founder, announced he would build a 150 square metre Rain Room in Bali. The plan was shelved due to Tek's ill-health. A number of Chinese companies have copied the Rain Room concept and, in 2016, the Chinese Jiajiale Dream Park opened its $15 million Rain Room clone called the Magic Rain Zone. One company offers as many as 12 clones of the installation. Koch estimated that as many as 8-10 companies had produced Rain Room clones.  Instant Structure for Schacht XII  The group's first outdoor installation was Tower: Instant Structure for Schacht XII, created for Urbane K√ºnste Ruhr for the Ruhrtriennale 2013. The work cycled 30,000 litres of water per minute from the former coal mines of Zollverin, a World Heritage site, to create an instantaneous towering structure of water. The mines pump millions of water out each year to maintain the surrounding area's structural integrity.  Self & Other  The first permanent installation in the UK for Random International, Self & Other, is located on the South Bank arts and cultural area of the Albert Embankment. It was launched in July 2018.  Swarm Studies  A series of works based on LED walls that mimic the flocking behavior of birds, fish, and insects, Random International's Swarm Studies have been created ranging from a small version, Swarm Study / XI, at the Park Hyatt New York‚Äôs restaurant Bevy, to the huge Swarm Study / IX, which spans the entire fa√ßade of the train station in Chemnitz, Germany‚Äîthe group's largest installation at the time. The first of these studies, 2010's Swarm Light is in the collection of the Maxine & Stuart Frankel Foundation For Art in Michigan. Commissioned by London's V&A;, Swarm Study / III consists of four cubic forms suspended from the ceiling, each made of a grid of illuminated brass rods. A camera tracks visitors, making the lights of the installation flicker, brighten, and dim in response to their movements.  Everything & Nothing  The group's first solo exhibition in Asia, Everything & Nothing, was on display at Shanghai's Yuz Museum from 20 April ‚Äì 2 September 2018. The exhibition takes its title from the video installation, Everything & Nothing (2016), which attempts to question humankind‚Äôs place in a technological dynamic by showing a steamroller crushing everything in its path. Everything & Nothing is the collective's first work to be created from video alone, a loop of over 6 hours. The piece was originally commissioned for the Wonder Materials exhibition at the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry, where it was displayed in 2016. Everything & Nothing \\"documents the simultaneous decay and progress of the industrialised world in an age of relentless transformation.\\" The collective's newest work at the time of the exhibition was also displayed, Turnstiles (2018), an analogue piece which consists of a maze of barriers. Self & Other, another exhibit, consists of a reflective wall of mirrors, light and glass which reflect the visitor taking a selfie. The exhibition also saw Rain Room return to the museum in a revised and larger format, 1,600 square feet (larger, in fact, than the Sharjah installation). Time Out Shanghai reviewed the exhibition saying, \\"Everything & Nothing is a meditative video installation about how fucked we are in this age of un-tempered technological advancement. 'Turnstiles' tracks the same story, but instead with a matrix of spinny turnstiles that you can navigate while doing your best to avoid serious injury to the groin area.\\"  Previous works  The group has previously held solo exhibitions at Lunds Konsthall, Sweden (2014), Carpenters Workshop Gallery, Paris (2012), and Pace Gallery, New York (2016). Its work is held in the collections of MoMA, Sharjah Art Foundation, Yuz Museum, LACMA and London's V&A;, where its Swarm Study / III is on long-term display. In 2017, its work Zoological debuted at London‚Äôs Roundhouse as part of Wayne McGregor‚Äôs +/- Human. The group's work has also formed part of the Lichtsicht Biennale (2015), Ruhrtriennale (2013), and Moscow Biennale of Contemporary Art (2011).

In 2018 he complained that government agencies were undermining the improvement of transparency by not publishing up to date procurement information on their websites. The Editors Forum of Namibia have criticised Simataa for a lack of commitment to the forum's Code of Ethics and Conduct. In May 2018, Simataa rejected a report by IPPR which stated that government monopolies were one of the leading causes of corruption in Namibia, calling the report 'prejudiced'. When he was not reappointed into cabinet in March 2020 he also resigned his seat in parliament.

This is because a simple model may have a high level of accuracy but be too crude to be useful. For example, if the incidence of category A is dominant, being found in 99% of cases, then predicting that _every_ case is category A will have an accuracy of 99%. Precision and recall are better measures in such cases. The underlying issue is that there is a class imbalance between the positive class and the negative class. Prior probabilities for these classes need to be accounted for in error analysis. Precision and recall help, but precision too can be biased by very unbalanced class priors in the test sets.

After transfer to the Territorial Force it served with the 53rd (Welsh) Division in Palestine in World War I and in North West Europe in World War II. Its successors serve with today's Army Reserve. Volunteer Force The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Volunteer Corps composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8. An Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVC) of two batteries was formed at Newport in Monmouthshire on 4 October 1860. Two additional batteries were raised by 1863: C at Abercarn and Crumlin, Caerphilly, and D at Blackwood, Caerphilly.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 131‚Äì2.Beckett, Appendix VIII. Charles Lyne was appointed Major in command.Army List, various dates. In 1864 the unit was included in the 1st Administrative Brigade of Glamorganshire Artillery Volunteers, but it raised two more batteries at Newport in 1866 and became an independent unit, with Lyne promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. In 1873 the 1st Worcestershire AVC was attached to it, and the following year the 1st Administrative Brigade of Monmouthshire Artillery Volunteers was formed, comprising the two units, with its headquarters (HQ) at Newport and Lyne in command.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 81.Litchfield & Westlake, p.172. However, by 1878, the 1st Monmouths were down to a strength of two batteries, and the admin brigade was renamed the 1st Administrative Brigade of Worcestershire Artillery Volunteers, with HQ moving to Worcester. Charles Lyne retired and became Honorary Colonel of the brigade. His son, Lt-Col C.R. Lyne, became commanding officer in 1883.Lyne Obituary, Evening Express, 8 July 1901 at Welsh Newspapers Online. When the artillery volunteers were consolidated in 1880, the brigade became the 1st Worcester (Worcester and Monmouth) AVC, with the former 1st Monmouthshire reduced to Nos 7 and 8 Batteries at Griffithstown. Recruitment picked up in Monmouthshire during the 1880s, and by the end of the decade it was large enough to be an independent corps once more, with six batteries, and the HQ returned to Newport. 16-Pounder RML gun manned by Artillery Volunteers. The AVCs were intended to serve as garrison artillery manning fixed defences, but a number of the early units manned semi- mobile 'position batteries' of smooth-bore field guns pulled by agricultural horses. However, the War Office (WO) refused to pay for the upkeep of field guns and the concept died out in the 1870s. It was revived in 1888 when some Volunteer batteries were reorganised as 'position artillery' with 16-pounder Rifled Muzzle-Loading guns to work alongside the Volunteer infantry brigades. The six garrison batteries of the revived 1st Monmouthshire AVC were organised into three position batteries, named heavy batteries from 1903.Beckett, pp. 178‚Äì9.Litchfield and Westlake, pp. 3‚Äì6. The 1st Worcesters had formed part of the Welsh Division of the Royal Artillery (RA) from 1882 to 1889, and the Southern Division thereafter. The 1st Monmouthshire was placed in the Western Division on being reformed. In 1899 the Artillery Volunteers were transferred to the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA), the 1st Monmouths becoming the 1st Monmouthshire Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers) when the divisional organisation was abolished in 1902. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the 1st Monmouthshire transferred to the Royal Field Artillery (RFA) as the IV (or 4th) Welsh Brigade, with the following organisation:Litchfield, pp. 181‚Äì2.London Gazette 20 March 1908. 15-pounder gun, issued to the Territorial Force. IV Welsh Brigade, Royal Field Artillery * HQ at Drill Hall, Lime Street, Monmouth * 1st Monmouth Battery at Newport * 2nd Monmouth Battery at RiscaRisca at Drill Hall Project. * 3rd Monmouth Battery at GriffithstownGriffithstown at Drill Hall Project. * IV Welsh Brigade Ammunition Column at Newport The Newport Cadet Corps, RFA, was also affiliated to the brigade. The new brigade unit was part of the Territorial Force's Welsh Division and the batteries were each issued with four 15-pounder guns.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 117‚Äì23.53 (W) Division at Long, Long Trail.Conrad, British Army, 1914. World War I=Mobilisation= The units of the Welsh Division had just departed for their annual summer camp when the order to mobilise was received on 4 August 1914. They then returned home and assembled at their drill halls to mobilise. The 4th Welsh Brigade mobilised at Newport under the command of Lt-Col D.E. Williams, VD, who had been CO since 1911. By 11 August the units had completed their concentration and Territorial Force members were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. Four days later the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units, and on 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate batteries, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those Territorial Force formations being sent overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. =1/IV Welsh Brigade, RFA= 18-pounder preserved at the Imperial War Museum. At the end of August the Welsh Division concentrated at Northampton to continue its training. On 18 November the division was warned for garrison duty in India, but this was cancelled and in December it moved to Cambridge, then to Bedford in May 1915. In July the infantry of the division (now renamed the 53rd (Welsh) Division) embarked for service at Gallipoli, but the divisional artillery remained at Bedford. In October the batteries were re-armed with modern 18-pounder guns and on 8 November they handed over their obsolescent 15-pounders to the 2nd Line unit, which had just arrived at Bedford.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 83‚Äì90. 53rd (Welsh) Divisional Artillery was now ordered to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. It embarked on 20 November and had concentrated at Pont-Remy by 25 November, from where parties were sent to various divisional artilleries for instruction in front line duties. Meanwhile, after suffering appalling casualties at Gallipoli, 53rd (Welsh) Division had been withdrawn to Egypt to refit. On 30 January 1916 the divisional artillery was ordered to rejoin the rest of the division. The batteries entrained at Pont-Remy, embarked at Marseilles on 3 February and disembarked at Alexandria on 11 February. By 22 February the artillery had rejoined the division at Beni Salama. For the rest of the year the recuperating division was stationed in the Suez Canal defences. In May 1916 the Territorial Force field brigades were numbered, the 1/IV Welsh being designated CCLXVIII (268) Bde, RFA, and the batteries became A, B and C. Then on 25 December 1916 the divisional artillery was reorganised: A Bty was broken up between B and C Btys (to make them up to six guns each) and they were redesignated A and B, while B Battery (the former 2nd Glamorgan Bty) joined from the old CCLXV (I Welsh) Bde and became C (Howitzer) Bty, equipped with 4.5-inch howitzers. The brigade itself was redesignated CCLXVI (266) Bde. 53rd (W) Divisional Ammunition Column had remained in France, and was reformed in Egypt by abolishing the Brigade Ammunition Columns.Ward, p. 66. Palestine 4.5-inch Howitzer with 'ped-rails' (sand tyres) around wheels, as used in crossing Sinai Early in 1917 the Egyptian Expeditionary Force launched the Sinai and Palestine Campaign by crossing the Sinai desert and advancing against Turkish forces at Gaza City. The First Battle of Gaza began during the night of 25/26 March when 53rd (W) Division advanced to cross the Wadi Ghuzzeh, with CCLXVI Bde following 158th (North Wales) Infantry Brigade. Despite the darkness and morning fog ‚Äì 158th Brigade lost its way and arrived late ‚Äì the infantry were in position by 08.30 and at 10.10 CCLXVI Bde opened fire on Ali Muntar. However, the attack orders were late reaching the infantry, and the main bombardment did not begin until 12.00. The division's attack went well, with 158th Bde establishing a lodgement at Ali Muntar, but the artillery was too weak to suppress the Turkish fire and casualties were heavy. By 18.30 the division had taken all its objectives and its troops were in the eastern streets of Gaza when the attack was stopped for lack of water. Although 53rd (W) Division consolidated its position, it was withdrawn the following day.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 81‚Äì4.MacMunn & Falls, Vol I, pp. 286‚Äì97, 301‚Äì3, 310‚Äì5. 18-pounder gun in Sinai. For the Second Battle of Gaza, beginning on 17 April, 53rd (W) Division's role was to advance up the coast across Wadi Ghuzzeh, and then attack Gaza after an artillery bombardment. The bombardment was begun by the heavy artillery and warships offshore, then the 4.5-inch howitzers began firing gas shells against Turkish batteries. At 07.20, 10 minutes before Zero, the 18-pounders began engaging the objectives. The infantry attacked punctually at 07.30 and 53rd (W) Division captured Samson's Ridge. However, it could not push on because the neighbouring division was badly held up. Casualties had been high and gains minimal, and the EEF dug in for a summer of trench warfare.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 87‚Äì9.MacMunn & Falls, Vol I, pp. 335‚Äì7, 343, 348. Although the War Office was unable to provide more divisions for the EEF, it could send guns: 53rd (W) Division's batteries were temporarily brought up to a strength of eight rather than six guns, until further troops arrived.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 90‚Äì1, 93. The reorganised EEF renewed its offensive (the Third Battle of Gaza) on 27 October. XX Corps, including 53rd (W) Divisional artillery, moved into position during the night of 30/31 October to capture Beersheba, and the bombardment began at 05.55. After a pause at 07.00 to let the dust settle and determine the effect, the guns reopened. Infantry parties advanced to within of the barrage to finish cutting the barbed wire. They then rushed Point 1069 and the 18-pounder batteries began to move up to more advanced positions. Beersheba had fallen to the Desert Mounted Corps and XX Corps could bivouack on the objective.Falls, Vol II, pp. 44‚Äì7.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 98‚Äì9. On 3 November 53rd (W) Division was ordered to advance to the Tel es Sheria road. It was a difficult march over broken country in hot weather and CCLXVI Bde, escorted by 5th Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers (RWF), made a wide movement out to the east where there was a track over comparatively flat ground. There were several sharp actions with enemy detachments, and 5th RWF was called from escort duty to support the attack on the Khuweilfe heights. Over following days 53rd (W) Division kept up pressure on the enemy in the hills so that the EEF could roll up the main trench lines (the Battle of Hareira and Sheria). Then on 6 November the division assaulted the Khuweilfe position supported by an intense bombardment by all its own guns and a heavy battery. After confused fighting the position was held, with the support of the divisional artillery breaking up Turkish counter-attacks.Falls, Vol II, pp. 84‚Äì7, 94.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 104‚Äì5. 18-pounder with sand wheels. After breaking through the Gaza positions, the EEF pressed on to Jerusalem in appalling weather. The city was to be captured by XX Corps after a rapid advance by a flying column known as 'Mott's Detachment' that included 53rd (W) Division. Preliminary attacks began on 7 December and Jerusalem fell the following day, but there was still heavy fighting to the end of the year as the Turks threw in counter-attacks.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 113‚Äì6.Falls, Vol II, pp. 238‚Äì44. 250‚Äì1, 281‚Äì2. XX Corps renewed its advance in March 1918, 53rd (W) Division pushing forward a little on 2 March, then again on 6 March against only slight opposition, before the whole Corps advanced on 8 March. 53rd (W) Division's main objective was the hill of Tell 'Asur, and it was supported by plentiful artillery as well as its own brigades. The peak was taken, lost, and retaken, followed by four more Turkish counter-attacks. That night the division also took Chipp Hill, which had defied the neighbouring division during daylight, but on 10 March found the wadi in front too steep to climb, only passing over it during darkness on 12 March. The new line was held through the summer months.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 113.Falls, Vol II, pp. 312‚Äì21. In the summer of 1918 the 53rd Division was 'Indianised', with three quarters of the infantry battalions replaced by others drawn from the British Indian Army, but this did not affect the divisional artillery, which retained its composition to the end of the war.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, p. 124. At the climactic Battle of Megiddo 53rd (W) Division attacked late on the first day (18 September), after an hour's bombardment. After more than 20 hours' hard fighting, the main enemy position was taken and the guns could move forward. The pressure was kept up on 20 September and by the end of the next day the Turkish army was shattered.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 129‚Äì34. After the battle the division was withdrawn to Alexandria before the Armistice of Mudros came into effect on 31 October. Demobilisation began on 20 December and was completed in June 1919. CCLXVI Brigade was placed in suspended animation. =2/IV Welsh Brigade, RFA= French De Bange 90 mm gun Although 2/IV Welsh Bde was raised before the end of 1914, the 2nd Welsh Division (68th (2nd Welsh) Division from August 1915) did not concentrate at Northampton until Spring 1915, the brigade joining it on 29 April. It moved to Earlswood on 4 August 1915 and then arrived at Bedford to replace the 1st Line brigade on 2 November. Training of the units was made difficult by the lack of arms and equipment, and the requirement to provide drafts to the 1st Line overseas. In June the first saddlery and horses began to arrive, but no guns until August, when the brigade received four French De Bange 90 mm guns. Some ammunition wagons arrived in September, and eight more 90 mm guns in October. Training began to speed up, with the 90 mm guns standing in for 15-pounders. When the brigade arrived at Bedford it took over 12 x 15-pounders from the 1st Line. In December 1915 these in turn were replaced by modern 18-pounders.RFA at When the Welsh Came to Bedford. 68th (2nd Welsh) Division was assigned a role in Home Defence in November 1915 when it joined First Army (Home Forces) in Central Force, with its units quartered across Eastern England. In May 1916 the brigade was numbered CCCXLIII Brigade (343 Bde) and the batteries became A, B and C. Later in the year CCCXL (Howitzer) Bde (formerly 2/I Welsh Bde) was broken up and its A Bty (formerly 2/1st Glamorgan Bty) joined CCCXLIII Bde as D (H) Bty. The Home Defence divisions continually supplied drafts to units fighting overseas. In the autumn of 1916, A/CCCXLIII Bty was detached tand replaced by a newly-raised 502 (H) Bty, RFA. A Battery was then given back its old Territorial Force title as 502 (2/1 Monmouth) (Howitzer) Battery and left for France, while the new battery in CCCXLIII Bde was renumbered as 545 (H) Bty. 502 (2/1 Monmouth) (H) Bty disembarked at Le Havre on 6 October 1916, left two days later and joined CXXVI Bde RFA in 37th Division on 9 October, becoming its C (H) Bty on 23 October. It was equipped with four 4.5-inch howitzers.Army Council Instruction 2063 of 1 November 1916.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 71‚Äì9. 37th Division had been in France since the middle of 1915, but it had still not taken part in a major operation. Now it was involved in the Battle of the Ancre (the last phase of the Somme Offensive) starting on 13 November. 37th Divisional Artillery was in the line for the whole six-day battle, at first covering the front of 63rd (Royal Naval) Division before 37th Division took over the front. On 25 January 1917, C(H)/CXXVI Bty (the former 2/1 Monmouth Bty) was broken up and its Right and Left Sections used to make up D(H)CXXIII and D(H)CXXIV Btys up to six howitzers each. These two batteries served with 37th Divisional Artillery on the Western Front for the rest of the war. The rest of CCCXLIII Bde had disappeared from 68th (2nd W) Division's order of battle by mid-1917. Interwar The brigade was reformed in the 53rd (W) Division in 1920, initially as 3rd Welsh Brigade, RFA, and redesignated the 83rd (Welsh) Brigade, RFA, when the Territorial Force was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921 (becoming a Field Brigade, RA, in 1924 when the RFA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery). The howitzer battery was formed from a squadron of the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry and a company of the 1st Battalion, Herefordshire Regiment, giving the brigade the following organisation:Titles and Designations, 1927. * HQ at Drill Hall, Mendalgief Road, Newport, later at Lime Street, then at Dock Street * 329 (Monmouthshire) Field Bty at Newport * 330 (Monmouthshire) Field Bty at Cross Keys * 331 (Monmouthshire) Field Bty at Griffithstown * 332 (Radnorshire) Field Bty (Howitzers) at Llandrindod Wells, Radnorshire, later at Knighton The brigade was once more in 53rd (W) Division. Field Brigades were termed Field Regiments from 1938 onwards. World War II=Mobilisation= The TA was doubled in size following the Munich Crisis of 1938, with existing units splitting to form duplicates before the outbreak of World War II. 83rd Field Regiment reorganised as follows:Western Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. 83rd (Welsh) Field Regiment * 329 (Monmouthshire) Field Bty at Newport * 330 (Monmouthshire) Field Bty at Cross Keys 133rd (Welsh) Field Regiment * 331 (Monmouthshire) Field Bty at Griffithstown * 332 (Radnorshire) Field Bty at Knighton Both regiments were in 53rd (Welsh) Division throughout World War II and shared similar histories.Joslen, pp. 87‚Äì8. =Home defence= Parts of 53rd (Welsh) Division were sent to Northern Ireland from October 1939, and the whole division was stationed there from 3 April 1940 to 30 April 1941 as part of VI Corps.Joslen, pp. 346, 348.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex D.Collier Maps 17 and 20. The establishment of a field regiment from 1941 onwards was three batteries, each of two four-gun troops of 25-pounders with Quad gun tractors.Farndale, p. 99. On returning to mainland Britain, the division served under III Corps and Western Command. On 8 April 1942 it was assigned to XII Corps District, then from 15 May 1943 in XII Corps it became part of 21st Army Group training for the Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord).Order of Battle of the Forces in the United Kingdom, Part 2: 21 Army Group, 24 July 1943, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/238. Normandy 25-pounders and Quad tractors advancing in Normandy August 1944. 53rd (Welsh) Division was among the follow-up troops landing after D-Day (6 June). Its units were at sea from 21 June and completed landing on 27 June. On 1 July it relieved 15th (Scottish) Division on the River Odon after the Battle of 'Scottish Corridor'.Martin, pp. 51‚Äì5. 53rd Division was then involved in the Second Battle of the Odon from 15 July, capturing Cahier and holding on to it by hard fighting.Ellis, Vol I, p. 334.Martin, pp. 73‚Äì6. When the breakout from the Normandy beachhead began in early August, 53rd Division cleared the banks of the River Orne and then fought its way towards Falaise to help in closing the Falaise Pocket. By late August its units were across the Seine and driving over open country towards the River Somme.Ellis, Vol I, pp. 408, 440, 470.Buckley, pp. 188‚Äì9.Martin, pp. 108‚Äì9, 118‚Äì9. On 4 September the division cleared St Pol and was working its way through the canal area west of Lille.Ellis, Vol II, p. 6.Martin, pp. 120, 127, 143. On 12 September 83rd Regiment moved into the outskirts of Antwerp, where they were treated with hospitality by the liberated inhabitants, even while engaging enemy targets round the docks in grain elevators, tall buildings and hotels.83 Fd Rgt at RA Netherlands. Netherlands There was a pause at the Meuse-Escaut Canal before Operation Market Garden was launched on 17 September. XII Corps had an important subsidiary role clearing the country west of XXX Corps' main thrust.Ellis, Vol II, p. 44.Martin, pp. 145‚Äì6, 149‚Äì50. 83rd Field Regiment came into action to support 158 Bde's crossing of the Meuse-Escaut Canal, suffering some casualties from Luftwaffe air attack on the night of 18‚Äì19 September while crossing the canal. 133rd came into action and crossed the canal the following day in support of 160th Bde.133 Fd Rgt at RA Netherlands. On 4 October, the 83rd Regiment moved to Sint-Oedenrode in the Market Garden 'corridor' supporting 158th Brigade, and two days later 133rd Regiment moved with 160th Bde into the Nijmegen bridgehead captured during Market Garden. Both positions were under frequent fire: on 13 October the 330 Battery of the 83rd Regiment was shelled as the Germans prepared a counter-attack against 158th Bde; the battery lost seven killed and 12 wounded when the battery command post (CP) was hit by two shells. The CP was quickly re-established and the battery's defensive fire tasks were instrumental in defeating an attack that got within of 158th Bde's positions.83 Fd Rgt Roll of Honour at RA Netherlands. On 16 October 83rd Regiment took part in Operation Winkle: an intense fire programme by all arms rising to a crescendo, followed by loudspeaker appeals to German soldiers to desert to the Allied lines, covered by a smokescreen fired by the regiment. 25-pounders in action during the advance on 's-Hertogenbosch, 23 October 1944. After the failure of Market Garden, XII Corps was ordered to advance westwards towards 's-Hertogenbosch. The regiments left the Nijmegen area on 19 October and took up new gun positions. The attack on s'Hertogenbosch (Operation Alan) began at 06.30 on 22 October, the infantry of 160th Bde advancing behind a timed artillery programme, after which the guns moved forward. After two days' fighting, 158th Bde took up the attack, but it took two more days of house-to- house fighting supported by the artillery to clear the old town.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 123‚Äì4.Buckley, pp. 244‚Äì5.Martin, pp. 173‚Äì4. Next XII Corps was switched to clearing the country between the Wessem and Zig Canals as 21st Army Group closed up to the River Maas.Ellis, Vol II, p. 160. On 14 November the corps carried out Operation Mallard o cross the Wessem Canal. Both regiments fired in support of 51st (Highland) Division's assault crossing (Operation Ascot), followed by 53rd (W) Division's own crossing (Operation Bristol) in the evening.Buckley, pp. 239‚Äì40. On 3 December the guns supported 15th (S) Division in Operation Guildford to clear the banks of the Maas up to Blerick, opposite Venlo. The Commanding Officer of the 133rd Field Regiment was responsible for firing a large-scale smokescreen, which was maintained for over 11 hours during the operation, which was described as 'textbook'.Buckley, pp. 240‚Äì1.Martin, pp. 214‚Äì9. Further operations were halted by winter weather. On 20 January 1945 the division moved to the Eindhoven area to refit and train for a special operation. On the night of 4/5 February the gunners moved into concealed positions near Nijmegen. Operation Veritable The Battle of the Reichswald (Operation Veritable) opened at 05.00 on 8 February with the heaviest concentration of artillery employed by the British Army so far in the war. The bombardment hit enemy gun positions, HQs, and communications. After a pause and dummy attack at 07.40 to induce the Germans to man their guns, the Counter-battery fire was resumed and a barrage was laid down to protect the assaulting columns. At 10.30 the full barrage made its first lift and the advance began. Both regiments supported the advance of 71st Bde. By 15.00, 133rd Regiment was out of range, but it took over 2 hours to extract its guns from their muddy positions to move forward. 83rd Regiment also moved forward at 19.00. 53rd Division's objectives were the Brandenburg and Stoppelberg features in the northern part of the Reichswald. Opposition was not strong but the terrain was difficult. By 02.00 on 9 February the leading units were through the Siegfried Line defences and closing on the Stoppelberg. That feature was taken during the morning and the division pushed on to the edge of the forest, but it was hard to get guns and vehicles along the muddy forest tracks. The regiments deployed on German soil for the first time on 11 February. It took several days for the division to push on through Pfalzdorf towards Goch, mopping up opposition and fending off counter-attacks. Goch fell on 21 February.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 257‚Äì67. 53rd Division was not involved in the assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder) on 23/24 March, but it crossed on 26 March and the next day attacked through Hamminkeln to Dingden. It then took part in the drive to the Elbe.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 293, 305‚Äì6, 310. The German surrender at L√ºneburg Heath, ending the fighting on 21st Army Group's front, came on 4 May. 83rd and 133rd (Welsh) Field Regiments were placed in suspended animation in 1946; 133rd was subsequently disbanded in 1947.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex M. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the 83rd Field Regiment was reformed at Newport as 283rd (Welsh) Field Regiment in 53rd (Welsh) Division.

The battle was fought at Valentia in Spain and ended in a stunning victory for the Pompeian army.Much of what we know of this battle comes from a single sentence from Plutarch's Life of Pompey: Near Valentia he [Pompey] crushed the generals Herennius and Perpenna, men of military experience among the refugees with Sertorius, and slew more than ten thousand of their men. Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18. Background In 88 BC Lucius Cornelius Sulla marched his legions on Rome starting a civil war. Quintus Sertorius, a client of Gaius Marius, joined his patron's faction and took up the sword against the Sullan faction (mainly optimates). After the death of Lucius Cornelius Cinna and Gaius Marius, Sertorius lost faith with his factions leadership. In 82 BC, during the second war against Sulla, he left Italy for his assigned propraetorian province in Hispania.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 6. Unfortunately his faction lost the war in Italy right after his departure and in 81 BC Sulla sent Gaius Annius Luscus with several legions to take the Spanish provinces from Sertorius.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 7. After a brief resistance Sertorius and his men are expelled from Hispania. They end up in Mauretania in north-western Africa where they conquer the city of Tingis. Here the Lusitanians, a fierce Iberian tribe who were about to be invaded by a Sullan governor, approached him. They asked him to become their war leader in the fight against the Sullans. In 80 BC Sertorius landed at the little fishing town of Baelo near the Pillars of Hercules (Gibraltar) and returned to Hispania. Soon after his landing he fought and defeated the Sullan general Fufidius (the aforementioned Sullan governor) at the Baetis river. After this, he defeated several Sullan armies and drove his opponents from Spain. Threatened by Sertorius' success the Senate in Rome upgraded Hispania Ulterior to a proconsular province and sent the proconsul Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius with a large army to fight him.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 68. Sertorius used guerrilla tactics so effectively he wore down Metellus to the point of exhaustion while his legate Lucius Hirtuleius defeated the governor of Hispania Citerior Marcus Domitius Calvinus. In 76 BC the government in Rome decided to send Pompey and an even larger army to help Metellus.Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 17. In the same year Sertorius is joined by Marcus Perpenna, who brought him the remnants of the army of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the rebel consul of 78 BC.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 15. Thus reinforced Sertorius decided to try and take the Spanish east coast (because the cities there support his enemies). His first target was the city of Lauron where he outgeneraled Pompey and massacred a large part of his army (see: the Battle of Lauron).Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 18; Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18; Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.5.31; John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp.226-227; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp.96-101. Prelude In 75 BC Sertorius decided to take on Metellus and leave the battered Pompey to his legates Perpenna and Herennius (probably a Samnite noble). Pompey and Metellus repeated their strategy of the previous year. While Metellus returned through the centre of Spain to the further province, Pompey once more marched his legions south toward the plain of Valentia. This time he met with no serious resistance until he reached Valentia itself. Here he found Herennius and Perpenna holding the line of the river Turia.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.48. The battle Perperna and Herrenius decided to give battle apparently under the impression they could defeat Pompey in a pitched battle.They might have had a low opinion of Pompey, who had been outclassed by Sertorius at Lauron, and underestimated him as a result. They fought in the narrow space which separated the river from the city walls. The battlefield gave no distinct tactical advantage to either side, so what developed was a conventional clash of strength, morale and endurance. Pompey's army of battle-hardened veterans totally outclassed and massacred their opponents.The Sertorian legates seemed to have forgotten Pompey's army was made up of veterans from the Civil War. These we experienced soldiers who knew how to fight and were not likely to break. Herennius himself was among the 10,000 casualties. Valentia was taken and sacked. Aftermath When word reached Sertorius of Herennius and Perpenna's defeat he decided to retrieve the situation in the north himself. He left Hirtuleius in charge of the western campaign against Metellus while he marched north to face Pompey. While Sertorius was en route Hirtuleius made things worse in the south by getting himself drawn into a pitched battle with Metellus near the Roman colony of Italica.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 118. At the Battle of Italica Metellus crushed Hirtuleius' army and immediately marched north in pursuit of Sertorius, he wanted to catch Sertorius between himself and Pompey's army. Pompey and Sertorius, both not wanting to wait for Metellus, met at the river Sucro, where Pompey almost lost his army and his life.Appian, Civil Wars, 1.110; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 19; Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18. Sertorius failed to destroy Pompey at the Battle of Sucro, and with Metellus on the way he had no other choice than to march inland and revert to guerrilla warfare. The war would drag on for another three years and only end when a few of his own men plotted against Sertorius and assassinated him.

The precinct previously contained a commissariat store, Maritime Services Board offices, dockyard and Department of Labour & Industry offices. Buildings in the precinct were developed in various stages since 1797 to date, with heritage-listed buildings dating from 1797 to 1939. The precinct is also known as the Museum of Contemporary Art, Maritime Services Board, Colonial Government naval dockyard, Commissariat Stores, Colonial Hospital, Kings and Queens Wharf and First Fleet Park. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 August 2011.  History  Sydney Cove is located in the country of the Cadigal people of the Eora nation. The absence of an archaeological record for the Cadigal (even allowing for large-scale city development) has led Karskens to believe that Sydney Cove was likely to be border country for the Eora nation and therefore possibly was not inhabited prior to European settlement. =From 1788 to 1799= In 1788 the establishment of the penal settlement at Sydney Cove occurred in the precinct. Early maps and views of the site indicate that alluvial mud flats extended from the mouth of the Tank Stream (at the head of the Sydney Cove) along the western shoreline of the cove approximately far as the present day Museum of Contemporary Art Australia (MCA), formerly the 1952 Maritime Services Board building. It is likely that the First Fleet disembarked on the western side of Sydney Cove, along a foreshore of small sandy beaches and rocky outcrops that extended north from the present day MCA building. For its first forty years the primary function of the colony of New South Wales was a penal settlement. Initially the settlement was provisioned entirely by the Commissariat. The topography of Sydney Cove determined the command structure of the settlement following the arrival of the First Fleet on 26 January 1788. The civil authorities settled to the east of the Tank Stream and the military authorities to the west. The pattern of settlement also determined the control of access to ships, stores and the waterfront. In 1792, Governor Arthur Phillip defined the boundaries of settlement: east of the Tank Stream were the residences of the Governor and civil authorities; west of the Tank Stream were the military barracks, parade ground and hospital. The convicts came to occupy the sandstone ridges (The Rocks) above Sydney Cove's western foreshores. Earliest plans of Sydney show no permanent occupation of the western side of Sydney Cove, other than the colony's first hospital (built 1788 along George Street) and the Hospital Wharf (constructed on the west side of Sydney Cove, close to the hospital). This was the first public wharf in the colony. The 1802 Hospital Wharf was timber framed with rubble infill and probably replaced an earlier wharf that was built by 1791. Governor Phillip's instructions prohibited the construction by private individuals of vessels capable of making contact with established ports within the region, or of trading within the area subject to the East India Company's monopoly. Earliest shipbuilding in the Colony was therefore initially a government activity. Phillip ordered that boats being built by private individuals were to be limited to fourteen feet () in length, to prevent escape attempts by convicts. The Government Wharf was the first wharf built at Sydney Cove, in 1788-90 on the eastern side, close to the present day Customs House. The Government Wharf survived until around the 1840s when Sydney Cove was infilled to create Circular Quay). In 1791 convicts of the Third Fleet were disembarked at the Hospital Wharf. Small boats only unloaded at the Hospital Wharf. Cargoes were unloaded from ships in stream into smaller vessels. By 1793 privately owned passage boats ran between Sydney Cove and Parramatta. Before 1797, shipbuilding was carried out only on the eastern side of Sydney Cove, around the Government Wharf. In 1797 Governor Hunter established the Government Dockyard on western side of Sydney Cove, north of the Hospital Wharf. Construction of the dockyard workshops, storehouse, boat sheds, sawyers' sheds, saw pits, watch house and a room for the clerk, all enclosed by a paling fence commenced the same year. 1797 returns show a dockyard workforce of 16 convicts. These were shipwrights, caulkers, boat builders, labourers and watchmen who repaired and refitted colonial and Royal Navy vessels and built small boats for the colony's settlements. The dockyard workforce increased to 27 convicts in 1799 and peaked briefly at 35 in 1800 before falling back to 27. In 1803 the convict workforce increased again to 42, rising to 49 in 1804 when the dockyard was especially busy. Isaac Nichols (an emancipated convict, later assistant to the Naval Officer, publican, trader and postmaster) built his first house, close to the Hospital Wharf. =From 1800 to 1809= In 1800 Governor King ordered all liquor to be unloaded at Hospital Wharf and no goods to be landed before 6am or after 3pm. In 1800 the stone house for Master Builder completed in the north of the dockyard. Dockyard completed. By 1805, dockyard workforce of around 40. It included apprentices, but few trained shipwrights. From 1805, land granted and leased along the banks of the Tank Stream to its mouth on Sydney Cove. Grants near Hospital Wharf included Isaac Nichols (1791), Mary Reibey (1809), Thomas Jameson & Daniel McKay. Emancipists Isaac Nichols and Mary Reibey were among the first to build residences and commercial premises on the Tank Stream/western Sydney Cove land grants. Land grants on the down slope allotments included the alluvial mudflats with a condition that the land be developed (making these the first sanctioned program of land reclamation in the colony). Due to reclamation and silting up of the Tank Stream, the extent of navigable water had receded by . In 1806 a report to Governor Bligh noted the dockyard was in need of repairs and additional buildings. Repairs and improvements were carried out by 1807. Isaac Nichols built a second, larger residence, facing George Street, between George Street and Hospital Wharf, that was used as Australia's first post office. Nichols also built a large, T-shaped three-storey warehouse building close to his new residence. =From 1810 to 1820= The first Market place, where storeholders and traders sold goods, was located on the western side of Sydney Cove between High (George) Street North and the Hospital Wharf (in present-day First Fleet Park). It was marked on Surveyor Meehan's 1807 map as a triangular public space at the junction of George Street and Hospital Wharf. In 1811 Governor Macquarie relocated the Market place to further south along George Street at the site of the present day Queen Victoria Building, where it was served by a new wharf in Cockle Bay. Mary Reibey built a residence identical to Isaac Nichols' residence and adjacent to his house. This was occupied by Michael Hayes, Irish patriot transported in 1800 for taking part in 1798 rebellion. By 1812 Hayes was a successful small trader. In 1809 the design and construction of the Commissariat Stores by Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Foveaux (the military administrator of the colony of NSW 1808-10, following the deposition of Governor Bligh). In 1810 the completion of the first (4-storey, waterfront) Commissariat Stores building by Governor Macquarie, by convict labour, with associated sandstone quay, steps and seawall. The Commissariat Stores was one of the largest buildings constructed in the colony to date. Survey of the dockyard noted the need for more building repair, some buildings beyond repair, the completion of repairs to buildings and the addition of the new Blacksmiths Shop. In 1812, construction of a provision store, granary and office for the Commissariat Stores on [Lower] George Street to the west of the 1809 Commissariat Store building. Later the 1812 building became known as the Ordnance Stores. Both the 1809 and the 1812 Commissariat Stores buildings were constructed by convict labour. The colony's farmers sold their produce to the Commissariat Stores. From 1812, produce of the Parramatta and Hawkesbury farms was transported by boat down the Parramatta and Hawkesbury Rivers, unloaded at the wharf and stored in the Commissariat. Surpluses were stored to regulate food supply and as a hedge against famine in drought years. The Commissariat Stories provided secure and vermin-proof storage of government provisions such as food (grain and vegetables grown in the colony), clothing, shoes, blankets, imported tools and equipment. These were distributed to the military and convicts \\"on stores\\" from 1788 to the end of the convict era in the 1840s. The Commissary Stores Receipts and Bills of Exchange were used as the colony's only currency until Governor Macquarie introduced regular circulating coinage in 1816. In 1812-1813, Governor Macquarie ordered the removal and replacement of the old Hospital Wharf with a new upgraded wharf renamed the Kings Wharf. Stone steps were built to access the wharf from George Street. In 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria, the wharf was renamed the Queens Wharf. In 1816 completion of the stone Coxswains Barracks (later known as Cadman's Cottage) to the north of the dockyard. This probably involved the demolition of an earlier building used by the boat crews and coxswains. While Cadman's Cottage was part of the Macquarie-era dockyard establishment, it is outside the curtilage of the Sydney Cove West Archaeological Precinct. Following the end of over two decades of war with France, Britain greatly increased the number of convicts transported to the colony of NSW. The colony's convict population more than doubled during the second half of Governor Macquarie's administration. Governor Macquarie considerably enlarged and improved the dockyard. Macquarie's improvements included the construction of: * four repairing docks (three of which were probably capable of dry-dock usage); * new wharfs and quays; * a sail room; * workshops; * boathouses; * offices for the Master Builder and Master Attendant; * a high stone wall around dockyard. =From 1821 to 1855= In 1821 Commissioner Bigge supported Macquarie's improvements to the dockyard and recommended they be completed as soon as possible. Francis Greenway noted that the Macquarie-era building works at the dockyards were carried out partly by convict and partly by contract labour. In the 1822 Macquarie's report to the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, Earl Bathurst (on his return to England) details his works at the dockyard:Historical Records of Australia, 1, 10, 685 This last item was the Coxswains Barracks - later known as Cadman's Cottage - part of the Macquarie- era dockyard establishment. The Government Coxswain supervised shipping from Sydney Cove; rostered boat crews who procured and shipped stores, timber, grass and shells for lime, and provided crews for the Governor's and naval officer's boats). The barracks probably served as office and quarters for some of the boat crews before it later came to be used as family accommodation for the coxswains. During 1822-1823 the storehouse, later known as the Colonial Storekeepers Building, was built at the north end of dockyard, south of the Coxswains Barracks. In 1823 works by S. L. Harris at the George Street (1812) Commissariat Stores building. In 1824, Nichols' 1808 house became the Australian Hotel, later the Liverpool Hotel. Between 1825 and 1828 the dockyard workforce increased from around 70 to around 100 convict men and boys. In 1827 Peter Cunningham described the work undertaken at the dockyards: Between 1830 and 1831 extensions to George Street Commissariat Store building. Necessitated removal of some buildings on south side and south-east corner of the dockyard. New boundary wall built on north side of the enlarged store. In 1831 dockyard activity being wound back and the establishment reduced to a minimum, around 14. Ship building and repairs put out to tender. Dockyard looks after small government boats only. Between 1831 and 1836 the demolition of buildings around the dockyard perimeter wall and construction of two office/residences. In 1833 the dockyard probably closed down. Subsequently, a committee appointed to examine establishment of new wharfage at the head of Sydney Cove. A decision made to infill and reclaim the entire Sydney Cove foreshores. In November 1833, a brig, Ann Jamieson, ignited and exploded while unloading a cargo of gunpowder and bar iron at the Kings Wharf, burnt to water level and sank. Kings/Queens Wharf remained obstructed for eight years, until 1841. Establishment of the colonial Ordnance Department occurred in 1836; which moved into the George Street (1812) Commissariat Stores building. In 1838 work began (starting on the east side of Sydney Cove) on the construction of Circular Quay, initially under the direction of Captain George Barney, colonial engineer and later under the Colonial Architect. From 1838 to 1847, completion of the first stage of the construction of Circular Quay. By 1844 Circular Quay had been completed on the east side of Sydney Cove as far as the mouth of the Tank Stream. The Tank Stream was then covered over and converted to a drain and sewer. The first stage involved convict labour in the reclamation of of mudflats and the construction of a large, stone seawall. The second stage of Circular Quay construction (the reclamation and infilling of the western side of Sydney Cove), from 1847 to 1855, used free men as the workforce. By 1854 work had reached the dockyard. Queen's Wharf was removed (the stone stairs at the wharf were retained). The four docks were infilled and landlocked. On its completion in 1855, Circular Quay was one of the largest foreshore reclamation works of the 19th century. It raised the Sydney Cove foreshore by to overcome the extremes of tides. About the same time Nichols' large warehouse was either demolished or remodelled for redevelopment of the site and the construction of the Oriental Hotel, next to Queens Wharf. In 1847 new walls constructed to north of the Commissariat store (within the old dockyard) and on part of the George Street frontage and the boundary wall rebuilt and there was further reduction in area of former dockyard. The Colonial Storekeepers Building (built 1823) was demolished. The following year the British Navy uses the Commissariat Stores for its stores. Following the end of the convict period, the Commissariat Stores is known as the Mercantile Free Stores and the Naval Stores. In 1849 there was a reduction in the importance of Ordnance Department. All establishments and lands for defence purposes are handed over to the Colony. =From 1856 to 1899= By 1859 Circular Quay was extended to Cadman's Cottage. On the completion of Circular Quay, a stone seawall extended north of the dockyard to Campbell's Cove where a timber wharf was built around that end of Sydney Cove. The foreshore in front of Cadman's Cottage remained tidal until . The land in front of Cadman's cottage was filled and raised 1870-75. Following the reclamation and infill of Circular Quay, development increased along the foreshore. From the 1850s n increasing numbers of ships visit Circular Quay. Silting in Circular Quay from the 1850s increased mud levels. Ships were often moored up to 23 metres from shore. Heavy ramps and gangplanks connected the ships to shore, but these caused the vessels to list. In 1856 the Commissariat and Ordnance stores transferred to the Colonial Government under the Constitution Act. Condition of transfer is that space be available to British Government in the Commissariat Stores for naval or military stores. the north wing of the building is used by the Colonial Storekeeper. In 1859 there were extensive repairs to Commissariat Stores and removal of wall between stores and former dockyard area. The repairs to Ordnance Stores were completed in 1861. From the late 1850s to -1864 Argyle Street was extended eastwards to the new Circular Quay foreshore and over the infilled northernmost and largest of the Macquarie-era docks. The Colonial Storekeepers Building, now separated from the dockyard by the Argyle Street extension, was demolished. The post of Government Coxswain had been abolished in 1846. Cadman's Cottage was now also separated from the landlocked dockyard and was handed over to the Water Police. New stores were built at south-east corner of (Lower) George Street and Argyle Street and the boundary wall rebuilt. During the 1860s and 1870s additional stores were built at the north end of site and some other buildings constructed around Commissariat Stores and in yards. Between the 1860s and 1890s the Ordnance Store continued in use for ordnance, military and Commissariat offices and stores. The Commissariat Store continued in use for Royal Navy stores. Nichols' 1808 house used as shopfront for a bricklayer, then a boarding house, then by Chinese merchants Yee Sang Loong. By the 1850s it was converted to the Australian Hotel. Reibey's house was later a ships chandlers, then a merchants, premises. From the late 1870s ferry services established from the Circular Quay, the first ferry jetty being built opposite the Customs House. During the 1870s and 1880s shipping companies leased permanent berths at Circular Quay. There was an increase in shipping trade and need for rail access saw shipping begin to move away from Circular Quay to Darling Harbour. Other commercial shipping was relocated from the head of Circular Quay to west and east sides. Served by warehouses on quay. Passenger shipping lines (e.g. Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O;)) remained at Circular Quay. From 1882, additional space was required for naval stores. The north wing of the Commissariat Stores surrendered for use by Navy. During 1889 and 1892, demolition (for extensive road widening) of Isaac Nichols' and Mary Reibey's houses along with other buildings on the east side of George Street in the vicinity of Queens Wharf (present day First Fleet Park). The site of the present-day First Fleet Park was cleared of buildings. Metropolitan Fire Brigade No 3 Fire Station was built on part of the First Fleet Park site. In 1890 the triangular land portion at the junction of George Street and Queens Wharf resumed for wharfage and other public purposes. In the 1890s, Circular Quay was dominated by passenger vessels and mail steamers. Around 5 million passengers a year arrived at Circular Quay. It was identified that an upgrade was needed to major wharf facilities. Commercial vessels were removed to Darling Harbour. In naval stores were transferred to Garden Island. The Commissariat Stores vacated. =From 1900 to 1960s= In 1900 the NSW Government resumed land in The Rocks and Millers Point as a result of the bubonic plague in the area. The Government gained control over a major residential, commercial and maritime precinct. In 1901, management of the former Commissariat Stores was transferred to NSW Government under the Sydney Harbour Trust (which later became the Maritime Services Board). The Sydney Harbour Trust was established to administer the land vested in it by government resumption. Queens Wharf was remodelled, widened and renamed Barton Street. Wharf activities relocated to Darling Harbour. Tram lines laid at Barton Street. Between 1901 and the 1930s the Commissariat Stores were leased out to business tenants. Ordnance Stores used to house government offices, including the NSW Taxation Department, Department of Agriculture, and laboratories. In 1904 the Sydney Harbour Trust Headquarters were built at corner of Pitt and Barton Streets, on the site of the Oriental Hotel. In 1908 a Royal Commission for the Improvement of the City of Sydney and its Suburbs was appointed. In 1913 the Town Planning Association of NSW established. John Sulman, an architect, championed the need for planned transport routes, public and open spaces and protection of harbour foreshores. Contemporary urban design schemes were curtailed by the outbreak of World War I. In 1914 an addition to the north end of Ordnance Store (1812 Commissariat building), probably for the Department of Agriculture's Chemical Laboratory. The Department of Labour and Industry also occupied the Ordnance Store. In 1923 a foundation stone was laid for new offices of the Department of Labour & Industry at the corner of George and Argyle Streets (132 George Street, now the Police Station). In 1936 the site for a new head office for the Maritime Services Board was chosen on the west side of Circular Quay in close proximity to the Department of Labour and Industry. The City Council introduced town planning legislation and a City Planning and Improvement Committee, with a precinct sub-committees. The same year the Maritime Services Board (MSB) took over the functions of Sydney Harbour Trust. The following year the Circular Quay Planning Committee (Butters Committee) suggests using the Commissariat and Ordnance Stores site for new MSB head offices. These to be sited in a parkland setting. The MSB building was part of the NSW Government's vision for the redevelopment of Circular Quay which included the construction of a new elevated city railway. The existing MSB offices were to be demolished for the railway. The Circular Quay Advisory Committee approved this recommendation and gave the tenants of the affected buildings three months notice. In 1939 the Commissariat and Ordnance Stores were demolished. This was one of earliest examples of public debate generated by the demolition of a historic building. Hyde Park Barracks was also under threat of demolition. It was instrumental in the formation of the heritage movement in Australia and the establishment of the National Trust of Australia in 1949. Between 1946 and 1952 construction of the MSB head offices on the site of the demolished Commissariat and Ordnance Stores was completed. In the 1950s and 1960s there was extensive foreshore redevelopment with further (and final) shoreline reclamation to the current alignment. The Metropolitan Fire Station and Sydney Harbour Trust building demolished between 1953 and 1956. Their sites and Barton Street were subsumed into a landscaped open park space (Maritime Reserve) south of the MSB building. In 1959 the new Overseas Passenger Terminal opened (north of the former dockyards area and outside the curtilage). In the early 1960s construction of the esplanade at Circular Quay West was completed. =From the 1960s to the present= A contemporary image of the precinct with the MCA building centre, First Fleet Park at left and partially obscured, and promenade. The NSW Government completed a comprehensive landscaping plan for a maritime reserve in 1985. The plan involved the closure and paving of Circular Quay West roadway between Alfred and Argyle Streets to form a foreshore promenade. The park space was extended and greened with plantings. In 1986 a redesign and renaming of the park space as First Fleet Park occurred in advance of the bicentennial celebrations of 1988. In 1990 adaptive reuse of the former MSB building as the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA). Conversion by Peddle Thorp and Walker included the extension to provide shop fronts to George Street and in November 1991 the MCA opens. In 1997 an international design competition held for the proposed MCA extension on the car park site adjacent to the MCA (former MSB building). The winning entry had several basement levels and did not proceed after site testing identified the archaeological remains of the Macquarie-era docks. In 2000 a new design proposal for a building to straddle the northern and middle docks and expose and leave visible some of the archaeological resource did not proceed, partly due to public opposition to the proposed changes. In 2010 works began on MCA extension in the car park area.  Description  The former Maritime Services Board Building (now the Museum of Contemporary Art) was built on the site of the demolished Commissariat Stores buildings, and on part of the old (infilled) government naval dockyard. The site of the former government dockyard continues to the north of the MCA building under the present car park that is the site of the current extension building to the MCA and also the Police Station at 132 George Street. The former dockyard site extends across the eastern extremity of Argyle Street and includes Bligh and Barney Park and land owned by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority immediately in front of Cadman's Cottage's SHR curtilage.. The site includes First Fleet Park to the south of the former MSB (current MCA) building. First Fleet Park is the site of archaeology associated with the Hospital, Queens and Kings Wharfs ( - 1813); the Market Place (-11); Isaac Nichols' houses and warehouse and the colony's first post office (-1808); Mary Reibey's house (1811), and the mouth of the Tank Stream (infilled 1840s). The Sydney Cove West Archaeological Precinct comprises two main elements: * Government dockyards (1797-1859) and associated buildings and structures * Early 18th residential and commercial precinct. These two site elements include the identified, predictive and potential significant archaeology of: # Government dockyards (1797-1859) # Commissariat Stores buildings (1810 and 1812-1939) # Hospital/Kings/Queens Wharf (-1908) # Isaac Nichols and Mary Reibey's houses, warehouse and post office (-1890s). =Government dockyards, 1797-1859= Bounded by George Street on the west and the pre-1859 Sydney Cove shoreline (now under the Circular Quay West promenade) on the east. The southern boundary was the Hospital/Kings/Queens Wharf (located in present-day First Fleet Park, immediately south of the 1952 former Maritime Services Board (MSB) building, now the MCA). The Macquarie-era dockyards extended north to include Cadman's Cottage (the former Coxswain's Barracks). Cadman's Cottage is not included in the curtilage for the Sydney Cove West Archaeological Precinct. During 1797-98 dockyards comprised workshops, storehouse, boat sheds, sawyers sheds, saw pits, watch house and a room for the clerk, were all enclosed by a paling fence. In 1800 a stone house for master builder added which completed the Hunter-era dockyards. An 1804 view of the dockyard shows a long open-fronted building (probably a boat shed) along the George Street frontage. During 1809-10 a new blacksmith's shop was built. By 1816 the Coxswain's Barracks (Cadman's Cottage) at the northern end of the dockyard had been completed. (An earlier building used by the boat crews and coxswains was probably demolished at this time). The construction of Circular Quay landlocked the dockyards by 1859 with the reclamation of the foreshore following the infilling of the docks in 1847. The foreshore in front of Cadmans Cottage was still tidal until the 1870s when a new timber wharf was built. Between 1870-75 the land in front of Cadmans Cottage was filled and raised. Between 1818 and 1822 Governor Macquarie's improvements considerably enlarged the dockyard. Four repairing docks were constructed (three of which were probably capable of dry-dock usage). Also built were new wharfs and quays, a sail room, workshops, boathouses and offices for the Master Builder and Master Attendant. A high stone wall was constructed around the dockyard. The four Macquarie-era docks extended from the north-eastern corner of the 1952 former MSB/MCA building northwards to Bligh and Barney Park. The southernmost dock has been partially identified and is partly located under the north-eastern corner of the MSB/MCA building and partly in the MCA car park. The middle and northern docks have been identified and are located under the present MCA car park which is the site of the approved MCA extensions currently in progress (2010). The northern dock is known to have stepped sides. The largest and northernmost dock is believed to be located partly under the eastern end of Argyle Street and partly in the adjacent Bligh and Barney Park. During 1822 and 1823 the storehouse (later the Colonial Storekeepers Building) was built at northern end of dockyard, immediately south of Cadman's Cottage (within Bligh and Barney Park). In -36 the buildings around the dockyard perimeter walls were demolished and two office/residences were constructed. A new boundary wall was built north of the enlarged George Street Commissariat store. Further reduction in area of the former dockyard occurred during 1847. Four Macquarie- era docks were infilled in the construction of Circular Quay during 1854-55; and land was reclaimed and the seawall built. New walls to north of George Street Commissariat Store (within the old dockyard) and on part of the George Street frontage were completed. During 1859 to 1863 Argyle Street was extended to the Circular Quay foreshore across the largest (infilled) northernmost Macquarie-era dock. Colonial Storekeepers Building was now separated from the dockyard by the street extension and demolished. New stores were built at the south-east corner of [Lower] George Street and Argyle Street. Later they were demolished for the 1923-5 building at 132 George Street. Removal of the wall between the stores and the former dockyard occurred during this period. During the 1860s and 1870s additional stores were built at the north end of the site and some other buildings constructed around the Commissariat Stores and in the dockyard. The construction of semi-Circular Quay landlocked the dockyards by 1859, but the original foreshore remained in front of Cadman's Cottage. Between 1870 and 1875 the land in front of Cadman's Cottage was infilled and raised. In 1914 the Department of Labour & Industry moved onto the dockyard site; and in 1923 a foundation stone was laid for new offices for the Department of Labour & Industry at the corner of George and Argyle Streets. The building later became the George Street Police Station. =Commissariat Stores buildings, 1810 and 1812 to 1939= The 1810 waterfront building was a four-storey stone building, built from cut blocks of sandstone immediately adjacent to the original shoreline. The shallow, U-shaped building had two short wings projecting to the east (the waterfront) from the main building. The wings enclosed a stone paved quay where ships anchored. The two wings had large openings on their eastern facades (that faced the waterfront) each with a cats eye fixed beneath the roof line for loading goods into the warehouse. The hipped roof, was initially shingle or clay-tiled but later re-clad with corrugated iron. The warehouse was timber floored. The 1812 George Street building was constructed as the provision store, granary and office for the Commissariat. Between 1830 and 31 the building was extended and a new boundary wall was built on the north side of the enlarged store. In 1836 the Ordnance Department was established in the colony and assigned the George Street Commissariat Store building which becomes known as the Ordnance Stores. Convict masons who constructed the Commissariat Stores carved their initials into each of the sandstone blocks used in the buildings. Both Commissariat Stores buildings were demolished in 1939 to make way for the new Maritime Services Board building (constructed 1946-52). =Hospital/Kings/Queens Wharf, -1908= The colony's first public wharf (a timber frame with rubble infill structure) was constructed by 1802, probably replacing an earlier wharf dating from at least 1792. It was located on the west side of Sydney Cove, close to the first hospital that was built in George Street in 1788. Storeholders and traders sold goods in the George Street marketplace, close to Hospital Wharf (within present day First Fleet Park). The market place was marked and named on Surveyor Meehan's 1807 map as a triangular public space at the junction of George Street and Hospital Wharf. The market place was relocated by Governor Macquarie in 1810-11 to further south down George Street (the site of the present day Queen Victoria Building) where it was now served by a new wharf in Cockle Bay. During 1812 and 1813 Governor Macquarie ordered the removal of the old Hospital Wharf and its replacement with a new upgraded wharf called the Kings Wharf. Stone steps were built to access the wharf from George Street. In 1833 the brig Ann Jamieson ignited and exploded while unloading a cargo of gunpowder and bar iron at the Kings Wharf, burnt to the water level and sank. The wharf remained obstructed until 1841. In 1837 the Kings Wharf was renamed the Queens Wharf on the accession of Queen Victoria; and in 1854 the Queens Wharf replaced by new public wharfage with the reclamation of land for Circular Quay. Between 1890 and 1908 the NSW Government resumesthe triangular land portion at the junction of George Street and Queens Wharf and, later, the land surrounding the site of the wharf. The former wharf area was remodelled and renamed Barton Street. Tram lines were laid along Barton Street and construction of the Sydney Harbour Trust headquarters at Pitt and Barton Street (on the site of the Oriental Hotel) was completed. =Isaac Nichols' and Mary Reibey's houses, warehouse and post office, -1890s= Between 1798 and 1800 Isaac Nichols constructed his first house, likely the first in the Colony, a whitewashed, gabled roofed cottage with skillion addition built near to Hospital Wharf. In 1808 Nichols constructed a second, large, two-storey house, built facing George Street North. The house was located between the Hospital Wharf and Mary Reibey's (identical) house, built 1811. In 1809 the Commissariat Store building was located close to Nichols house, immediately north of the Hospital Wharf. By the 1850s Nichols' house was converted to the Australian Hotel. Mary Reibey's house was later a ships chandlers then a merchants premises. Between 1843 and 1855 Nichol's large warehouse was either demolished or remodelled and the site redeveloped for the Oriental Hotel. In 1889 both Nichols' and Reibey's houses (with other commercial and residential buildings) were demolished for road widening. = Condition = In 1991, archaeological monitoring was carried out as part of work for the refurbishment of the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) and further investigations were carried out in 1997. These have provided substantial evidence for the survival of rare intact remains and deposits in the area. This was confirmed in 2009 when Godden Mackay Logan carried out a Ground Penetrating Radar survey on the First Fleet Park and MCA Forecourt area which showed large areas of below ground archaeological remains. Summary of archaeological testing, 1997 - 2008=Archaeological assessment of the MCA car park located beneath the northern wall of the present MCA building and the eastern terminus of Argyle Street= Substantial remains of the Macquarie-period dockyard (1810‚Äì22) survive within and to the north of the MCA car park site. It is possible that further remains may survive under, to the east and to the south of the 1952 former Maritime Services Board (MSB) building (the present MCA). Archaeological testing has located remains of three of the four docks built by Governor Macquarie 1818-22 in the Government dockyard. These are the northern, middle and southern docks. A fourth dockyard (the largest of the four) is predicted to the north of the site, located partly under Argyle Street and extending north into Bligh and Barney Park. Testing indicates that substantial portions of the two centre docks (the northern and middle docks) are extant. The line of the western ends of both these two docks and the alignment of most of the walls of the middle dock have been located. Both docks lie beneath the car park that is the site of the MCA extensions. Remains of a portion of the southern dock wall have been identified. This dock lies partly under the north-east corner of the former MSB/MCA building. It is considered that there is limited potential for the survival of the archaeology of other dockyard-period structures as shown on the historic plans. Testing has revealed various work surfaces around the docks which represent levels where the loading, unloading and repair of the ships took place. These work surfaces are likely to retain evidence of machinery bases for davits. ;Northern Dock This dock is known to have had stepped sides. 1997 testing of the southern wall located a row of rough sandstone blocks with stone rubble core and no wall facing. This indicates that the stepped ashlar coursing of this part of the northern dock has been removed. Testing of the western end of the northern dock revealed mortar beds which suggests that the upper ashlar courses have been removed. Testing in 1997 did not locate the northern dock wall. Testing was carried out in 1998 along the northern site boundary to determine the alignment of the northern wall of the northern dock. This revealed that intact stone coursing of the western end wall and north-west corner of the dock remained at lower levels. Above these courses the stonework had been removed leaving the mortar beds on which the stone had rested. Testing along the northern wall indicated that the lower steps were cut into bedrock. 1998 testing also revealed a vertical stone wall that was built on the northern dock wall. This was interpreted as a retaining wall built in the 1850s when Argyle Street was extended eastwards over the infilled dockyard to the newly created Circular Quay waterfront. ;Middle Dock Testing in 1997 located the top of the dressed southern face of the northern wall and the vertical wall face of large ashlar masonry to depth. Testing did not extend to the base of the wall so the dock floor was not revealed. An iron rail was also located, running parallel to the wall (east- west) and likely also to be connected with the dock's function. An iron mooring ring projecting from the northern wall was located. Exposed shell mortar on the upper surface indicated that at least one upper course had been removed. The wall was followed westwards to where it met rising bedrock, indicating that the western end of the middle dock was cut into bedrock with no stonework. The stonework of the southern wall was also located in the 1997 testing. Testing in 2000 revealed stonework of an east-west wall that was built on the northern wall of the middle dock in 1847 (when the dock was infilled and new walls were constructed in the old dockyard). In 2008 test holes determined the alignments of the walls of the middle dock, except for the south-west corner which was obscured by a modern service. Test holes revealed a mortar surface connected with the missing upper coursing of the western end of the middle dock and evidence of a coursing step. North of the middle dock, the level stepped up to what has been interpreted as a sandstone retaining wall running north-south between the middle and northern docks. A compacted cinder surface close to the wall is probably part of a dockyard period work surface. Testing south of the middle dock revealed a truncated wall running east-west with a flat, compacted sandy surface on its northern side which was probably another dockyard working surface. ;Southern Dock In 2000 testing close to the north-east corner of the former MSB/MCA building revealed shell-mortar covered sandstone slabs that are likely to be part of the southern wall of the southern dock. Their lack of shape indicates they were part of the wall core rather than stone facing or coursing which may have been removed. ;Dockyard area outside the three docks Testing in 2000 in the western part of the MCA car park, close to 132 George Street, located a remnant surface at the rear of the middle dock and sandstone footings that probably belonged to a dockyard building shown on a plan (thus a post dockyard feature). The footings butt up to the stonework of the 1847 wall running east- west that was built on the northern wall of the middle dock when the docks were infilled. =Archaeology of the Commissariat Stores= Archaeological monitoring has recorded structural remains of the Commissariat Stores that was demolished to ground level in 1939. Portions of sandstone flagging of the waterfront quay between the two wings of the 1809 Commissariat Stores building were recorded under the former MSB/MCA building and extending to the grassed area to the east of this building. =Archaeology of the Argyle Street terminus and Bligh and Barney Park= Limited testing under this section of Argyle Street has revealed some dressed sandstone slabs that probably belong to the dry dock (the largest of the four docks). The testing was too limited to make an assessment of the integrity of this dock. Other remains, including wall footings and large sandstone slab drains, were located in limited testing under Argyle Street and under the adjoining Bligh and Barney Park. =Archaeology of 1840s and 1850s seawall of Circular Quay= SHFA confirm the identified archaeology of the seawall constructed in the 1840s and 1850s for Circular Quay on the western side of Sydney Cove. Massive stone blocks were encountered at one location during development works to the MCA in 2010. =Cadman's Cottage= Archaeological investigations have identified evidence of the 1788 shoreline on the eastern side of the cottage (within the SHR curtilage for the Sydney Cove West Archaeological Precinct). =Potential archaeology= The potential has been identified for remains of the earliest dockyard buildings (dating from Governor Hunter's dockyard established in 1797) and other structures beneath the archaeology of the two Commissariat Stores buildings (1809‚Äì12). It is considered unlikely that remains have survived of the earlier dockyards that predate Governor Macquarie's enlargements as the four Macquarie-era docks were built into bedrock. There may be some limited potential for archaeology to the west of the docks but this will be remnant structural evidence such as parts of footings. Most of the known dockyard buildings were to the north of the AMP study area (i.e. north of the MCA carpark) or were underneath 132 George Street (within the study area). 132 George Street is cut down below current ground levels so the archaeological potential is low. Few structures are shown on historical plans dated earlier than 1847. =Archaeological testing 1991, 1993 & 2000 and Ground Penetrating Radar Survey, June 2009=Archaeology of First Fleet Park First Fleet Park has been assessed as having high archaeological potential based on archaeological monitoring and testing activities by Casey & Lowe in the 1990s that provided a predictive model for the presence of subsurface remains. This informed the analysis of the remote sensing survey by ground penetrating radar (GPR) undertaken in June 2009 for the First Fleet Park CMS. This information strongly invalidates the site assessment in The Rocks and Millers Point Archaeological Management Plan (1991) which stated that the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) area was likely to be completely disturbed. The construction of the former Maritime Services Board building (the present MCA) in 1946-52 was accompanied by the raising of the ground level of the landscaped and park areas by . This would suggest the retention of archaeological deposits, particularly in the present MCA forecourt area.Casey, 1991. The major upgrade and landscaping program to First Fleet Park for the 1988 bicentenary involved the further raising of its ground level by around one metre. 1991 and 1993 archaeological monitoring programs for stormwater services and street works interpreted the following sub-surface features in First Fleet Park as: # A dry-coursed sandstone seawall which may date to the 1840s reclamation and infill program that created Circular Quay. # Timber piles belonging to the mid nineteenth century Queen's Wharf. # Wall foundations of buildings south-west of the Hospital/Kings/Queens Wharf along George Street that likely included the foundations of Isaac Nichols' 1808 house that was used as the colony's first post office. # Some wall remnants of the demolition layer of early nineteenth century buildings (demolished 1880s) located at the junction of Queens Wharf and George Street. # In the area of the present MCA forecourt, large rough-cut sandstone blocks laid without mortar at around below ground, below which was bedrock at . These were interpreted as a section of the quay floor associated with the 1809 Commissariat Stores building. Remains of brick structures and associated deposits were also identified that were demolished prior to the construction of the 1809 Commissariat Stores. The First Fleet Park CMS (2009) assesses the potential archaeological resource of First Fleet Park as: # Evidence of the original landform; # Aboriginal cultural material; # Earliest post-contact occupation deposits including pre-Commissariat Stores structures; evidence of Isaac Nichols' houses and warehouse (1798-1800, 1808) and Mary Reibey's house (1811); original foreshore warehouses; other uses of the foreshores prior to wharf structures; # Wharves and maritime activity from 1797; # Reclamation and infilling for Circular Quay from the 1840s and associated seawalls; and # Later nineteenth century and early twentieth century occupation relating to demolished buildings and landscape items prior to demolition of the area from 1939. The Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey, undertaken in 2009 to ascertain the likely archaeological resource and service constraints in First Fleet Park, surveyed a total area of . The GPR survey results were limited by the thick layer of clay infill used in the 1980s park redevelopment. This limited the penetration of the radar signal to around depth only. Detection of archaeological remains at First Fleet Park was therefore unlikely as most were located below this depth. The GPR survey did succeed in identifying significant subsurface features. But many of the strongest signals (such as large anomalies at shallow depths of ) were service-related rather than subsurface features. Anomalies at depths of have been interpreted as possibly archaeological in nature. These include: # In the south-west corner of First Fleet Park, a strong linear feature running on a diagonal to the current George Street alignment disappears between . This may be building foundations from the original George Street frontage of early nineteenth century residential, commercial and retail premises. It aligns with Casey & Lowe's interpretation, from its 1993 archaeological monitoring program, of nineteenth century building foundations, potentially those of Isaac Nichols' houses and warehouse (1798-1800 and 1808). # A linear feature running west to east that may be associated with the Kings/Queens Wharf (dating from 1816). # A linear feature running north-south that may be a seawall associated with the 1840s land reclamation and infill for Circular Quay. This was revealed in archaeological monitoring as having been previously disturbed by the laying of telephone cables and other services. # A strongly rectangular anomaly at depth may indicate the foundations or basements of buildings that abutted the north of Isaac Nichols' house, near the Hospital/Kings/Queens Wharf. # The foundations of the Commissariat Stores 1809 building are clearly visible in the Forecourt of the present MCA (former MSB) building. # An extremely strong, consistent signal at depth (strongest at ) running north/northwest across the car park, north of the present MCA (former MSB) building. This corresponds with the remains of the dockyard. # Other strong signals are likely to relate to the docks, wharfage construction (stone quay) or later building foundations. Archaeological testing has revealed that substantial remains of the Macquarie-period dockyard (1810‚Äì22) survive within, and to the north of, the MCA car park site. It is possible that further remains may survive under, to the east, and to the south of the present MCA (former MSB) building. Remains of three of the four stone docks built by Governor Macquarie 1818-22 in the Government dockyard have been located. These are the northern, middle and southern docks. A fourth dockyard (the largest of the four) is predicted to the north of the site, located partly under Argyle Street and extending north into Bligh and Barney Park. Testing indicates that substantial portions of the two centre docks (the northern and middle docks) are extant. The line of the western ends of both these two docks and the alignment of most of the walls of the middle dock have been located. The exposed sections of the middle dock are highly intact. The integrity of the middle dock is higher than the northern dock. Both docks lie beneath the car park that is the site of the MCA extensions. Remains of a portion of the southern dock wall have been identified. This dock lies partly under the north-east corner of the 1952 MCA (former MSB) building. Testing has revealed various work surfaces around the docks which represent levels where the loading, unloading and repair of the ships took place. These work surfaces are likely to retain evidence of machinery bases for davits. It is considered that there is limited potential for the survival of the archaeology of other dockyard-period structures as shown on the historic plans. A section of the 1840s-1850s seawall of Circular Quay has been identified in 2010 development works at the MCA where massive stone blocks were encountered in one location. Overall the site is partly disturbed. Archaeological investigation indicates that there is disturbance to the depth of bedrock on the western boundary between the current MCA (former MSB) building and George Street. However, potential archaeological remains that have been detected in ground penetrating survey (2009) in the landscaped areas between the MCA building and Circular Quay and in First Fleet Park are expected to be better preserved since the ground level here was raised in the mid and later 20th century. = Modifications and dates = *1789-92: Hospital Wharf built on the west side of Sydney Cove. *1797: Governor Hunter establishes the Government naval dockyards on the west side of Sydney Cove. *1798-1800: Isaac Nichol's builds the first house on the west side of Sydney Cove, next to the Hospital Wharf. *1805: First land grants along the Tank Stream banks to its mouth on Sydney Cove. *1808 Isaac Nichols' builds his larger residence that becomes Australia's first Post Office and a large warehouse next to Hospital Wharf and the Commissariat Stores. *1809 and 1812: Commissariat Buildings constructed. *1810-1811: Market Place (near George Street and Hospital Wharf) relocated to site of present-day Queen Victoria building. *1811: Mary Reibey builds her house next to Isaac Nichols' house. *1812-1813: Hospital Wharf replaced with King's Wharf. *1818-1822: Governor Macquarie builds four new docks and generally enlarges and extends the dockyards. *1830-1831: Extensions to the George Street (1812) Commissariat Store building with removal of adjacent buildings and a new boundary wall on the north side of the extended store building. *1831-1836: Dockyards wind down and perimeter buildings are demolished.

Heritage listing  As at 28 July 2010, the Sydney Cove West Archaeological Precinct is a site of exceptional archaeological significance as evidence of some of the earliest colonial and maritime infrastructure of the convict settlement of Australia. The site has outstanding and unique historical significance for the identified, predictive and potential archaeology of: the first Government naval dockyards established in Australia (1797) that were improved and enlarged by Governor Macquarie (1818‚Äì22); the Commissariat Stores buildings constructed by Governor Macquarie (1810 and 1812); the seawall constructed for Circular Quay (1840s-1850s); the first public wharf built in the colony (); the colony's first market place (-11), the first post office (), the Colonial Storekeepers Building (1823) and one of the colony's earliest commercial and residential precincts that included the residences and premises of important early emancipists Mary Reibey and Isaac Nichols (dating from ). The site may also contain remains associated with pre-1788 Aboriginal occupation of the area. The site has state significance as a convict landing place. The general area for the landing of the First Fleet is likely to have been the western foreshores of Sydney Cove, somewhere north of the former Maritime Services Board building. The Third Fleet are known to have landed at the Hospital Wharf in 1791. Sydney Cove West Archaeological Precinct has state significance for its associations with Governor John Hunter, who established the colonial dockyard in 1797; with the military administrator Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Foveaux who commissioned and started the Commissariat Stores building in 1809; with Governor Macquarie who completed the 1810 and commissioned the 1812 Commissariat Stores buildings and improved and enlarged the dockyard in 1818-22 with additional premises and four new docks; with significant early emancipists Isaac Nichols and Mary Reibey who built their residences, warehouse and the colony's first post office on the site of First Fleet Park between 1798 and 1811; with the convicts of the Third Fleet who disembarked at Hospital Wharf in 1791, and with Lieutenant-Colonel George Barney, colonial engineer, for the construction of this section of Circular Quay between 1844 and 1859. Sydney Cove is the iconic marker of European settlement of Australia, and a site of historical significance for earliest contact of the Aboriginal people with European colonisers and of consequent Aboriginal dispossession. The site has social significance for the people of Australia as both a site of dispossession and of settlement, being one of the earliest sites of European settlement of the colony of NSW, and a site of over 200 years of continuous European occupation. The site has social significance for the public debate of 1939 following the demolition of the Commissariat Stores buildings that fostered the beginnings of a public awareness of the heritage of NSW and the formation of the National Trust of Australia, after World War II, in 1949. The site has high research potential through the large extant archaeological remains on the site. Sites containing earliest 19th century (and potentially late 18th century) archaeological remains are very rare in Australia. The Sydney Cove West Archaeological Precinct is a very rare archaeological resource due to the extent of late twentieth century disturbance of most early sites of this nature. It is potentially capable of answering questions about the earliest years of European settlement in Australia and represents a finite, rare and endangered resource. Sydney Cove West Archaeological Precinct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 August 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The item has outstanding and unique historical significance as the site of: the first Government dockyards established in Australia in 1797; the colony's main Commissariat Stores buildings of 1810 and 1812; the first public wharf built in the colony, (dating from ) the colony's first market place (-1811); first post office (dating from ); one of the colony's earliest commercial and residential precincts (dating from ) that included the residences and premises of important early emancipists Mary Reibey and Isaac Nichols, and the first (Semi) Circular Quay construction of the 1840s and 1850s. The documentary, map, pictorial and archaeological evidence demonstrates the exceptional significance of the site's unique historical association with the first decades of European penal settlement, of significant government, private commercial and maritime activity of the convict period, and of the sites continued use as the main dockyard of the colony throughout most of the convict period until at least the 1830s and possibly into the 1850s. The layout and fabric of the Macquarie docks has been preserved to a considerable extent by the transformation of the site in the 1840s and 1850s which saw the four docks infilled and landlocked by reclamation to create the western arm of Circular Quay. Recent archaeological investigations have demonstrated remnant intact fabric of the Government naval dockyards that were improved and extended by Governor Macquarie in 1818-22 from the original dockyards established by Governor Hunter in 1797, and of the 1810 Commissariat Stores building. The site has exceptional state significance for the identified archaeology of two of the four docks built by Governor Macquarie and of the Commissariat Stores building of 1810. This was the largest built work in the colony at the time. It remained a significant example of the earliest colonial infrastructure and in continuous use for 130 years by naval and government departments and commercial tenants until its demolition in 1939 for the Maritime Services Board headquarters (now the Museum of Contemporary Art). The site is also evidence of the construction of (Semi) Circular Quay in the 1840s and 1850s which was a major colonial engineering work of the mid nineteenth century. Recent ground penetrating radar survey of First Fleet Park indicates potential archaeology of the early commercial and residential precinct that included buildings associated with Isaac Nicholls and Mary Reibey. The site has state significance as a convict landing place. The general area for the landing of the First Fleet is likely to have been the western foreshores of Sydney Cove, somewhere north of the former Maritime Services Board building. The Third Fleet are known to have landed at the Hospital Wharf in 1791. It is also significant in the context of Sydney Cove as the location of earliest contact of the Aboriginal people with European colonisers and as a site of earliest Aboriginal dispossession by European settlement. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The site is associated with Governor John Hunter, who established the colonial dockyard in 1797; with the military administrator Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Foveaux who commissioned and started the Commissariat Stores building in 1809; with Governor Macquarie who completed the 1810 and commissioned the 1812 Commissariat Stores buildings and who improved and enlarged the dockyard in 1818-22 with additional premises and four new docks; with significant, early emancipists Isaac Nichols and Mary Reibey who built their residences, warehouse and the colony's first post office on the site of First Fleet Park between c.1798 and 1811; with the convicts of the Third Fleet who disembarked at Hospital Wharf in 1791, and with Lieutenant-Colonel George Barney, colonial engineer, for the construction of this section of Circular Quay between c.1844 and 1859. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The item is not significant under this criterion. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Sydney Cove is the iconic marker of European settlement of Australia, and a site of earliest Aboriginal dispossession. The site has social significance for the people of Australia as both a site of dispossession and of settlement. It is one of the earliest sites of European settlement of the colony of NSW that demonstrates over 200 years of continuous European occupation. It is also one of the earliest sites of Aboriginal dispossession. The demolition of the Commissariat Stores buildings in 1939 (being among the earliest landmark colonial buildings that had survived in use for 130 years) marked one of the earliest public debates on the merit of demolishing historic buildings in the name of \\"progress\\". This demolition fostered the beginnings of a public awareness of the heritage of NSW and the formation of the National Trust of Australia, after World War II, in 1949. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site may contain remains associated with pre-1788 Aboriginal occupation of the area, although it is likely that any remains may have been destroyed by later construction activities. The site contains the identified and predictive archaeology of the first colonial Government dockyard in Australia (dating from 1797 and enlarged by Governor Macquarie 1818-22); the 1810 and 1812 Commissariat Stores buildings, and the 1840s and 1850s seawall constructed for Circular Quay. The site contains the potential archaeology of some of the earliest residential and commercial buildings of the colony (including the first post office) that were associated with prominent emancipists Isaac Nichols and Mary Reibey, as well as the colony's first public wharf (dating from 1798) and the colony's first market place (-11). The docks, in association with other aspects of the Dockyard, are likely to contain archaeological structures, features and deposits that will inform us about early maritime practices associated with shipbuilding, maintenance and repair. These remains may also inform us about the day-to-day activities in the Dockyard and the convicts who worked there.Casey, May 1997 The site has high research potential through the large extant archaeological remains on the site. The archaeological resource has the potential to provide details on many questions that cannot be addressed in any other way. Sites containing 18th century archaeological remains are very rare in Australia and these have the potential to address questions about the earliest years of European settlement in Australia. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The docks are the earliest stone docks built in Australia. This was the first government and naval dockyard in Australia. 18th century archaeological remains are very rare in Australia and this site contains the substantial remains of a dockyard begun in 1797 and enlarged and extended 1818-22. It contains the archaeological remains of the 1840s and 1850s seawall of Circular Quay - a major colonial engineering work of the time - as well as the 1810 and 1812 Commissariat Stores (the 1810 building being the largest building in the colony at the time, which remained in use until 1939). It contains the potential archaeology of the first public wharf, the first post office and the first market place. It is a very rare resource which is potentially capable of answering questions about the earliest years of European settlement in Australia. Due to the extent of late twentieth century disturbance of most early sites of this nature, any area with potential for in situ preservation of relics from nineteenth century Sydney, and particularly the early part of the century or prior to 1800, represent a finite, rare and endangered resource. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The item is unique in the history of European settlement of Australia and is not therefore significant for its representative values.

The small dusty village by the name of the fort is adjacent to the fort. This fort is situated 180 km from Nagpur and 80 km from Chandrapur. History This village is supposed to be established in Dwapara Yuga by a king named Vairacan ( Son from a moon family). The city was ruled by the Mana chiefs, who about the 9th century fell before the Gonds. The Gonds ruled it along with Garbori and Rajgad. Vairagad once possessed diamond mines and are referred in the Ain-i-Akbari of Abul Fazal. on a hill at the foot were supposed to be a mine, now an old Idgah and 108 Musalman tombs appear to be of those soldiers killed in the battle when Ahmad Shah Bahamani of Bahmani Sultanate raided Vairagad in about 1422.

Description  Trachinotus africanus is a very deep bodied fish, silver in colour with blue fins with yellow margins. The fish has a blunt nose and does not have large spots. Distribution Trachinotus africanus has a disjunct distribution with three populations. There is a population in the south-western Indian Ocean along the African costa from Knysna in South Africa to Delagoa Bay in Mozambique; a second population is in the northern Indian Ocean from the Gulf of Aden in Yemen to Karachi in Pakistan; and the thirs population is around Bali in Indonesia. This species was described in 1967 by the South African ichthyologist James Leonard Brierley Smith (1897-1968) with the type locality given as Knysna.  Habitat and biology  Trachinotus africanus is an inshore species of the surf zone which has a tolerance for water with low salinty and will enter estuaries. It is a bottom feeder which prefers the seaward edges of reefs which frequently forages for food in wave formed gullies in sandy substrates and along the edge of the wave zone. It is a solitary species. The fish feed upon rock mussels, sand mussels, sand dollars, crabs, and mole crabs. The fish consumes these with a powerful pharyngeal dentition.  Human interest and conservation Trachinotus africanus is a quarry species for recreational shore and boat angling, spearfishing and subsistence fisheries in South Africa. It is a very popular species for recreational fishing in KwaZulu Natal and its commercial use is banned there, in the Western Cape fish caught in False Bay can be sold. There is a closed season which rules from 1 October to 30 November. The fish is lauded for being excellent table fare, being grilled or prepared on a braai.

It was exhibited at the Harley Gallery and Foundation's Portland Collection from 2016 until it was stolen in November 2018. History Winifred (left) at the anointing of Queen Alexandra, 1902 In 1902, William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland commissioned Cartier to make the tiara for Winifred, his wife, to wear at the coronation of Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. Winifred was one of the duchesses who held a canopy over Alexandra during her anointing ceremony. Afterwards, some of the gems were removed from the tiara to make a brooch. The gems are absent in a 1925 portrait of Duchess Winifred wearing the tiara. In the 1920s, Winifred wore the tiara as a band across her forehead. =Theft= In 2016, the Harley Gallery and Foundation opened the Portland Collection Gallery within the estate of Welbeck Abbey, Nottinghamshire. The tiara and brooch were displayed in an armoured glass case. On 20 November 2018, thieves broke into the gallery at around 22:00, broke into the display case using power tools and took the tiara and brooch. Security personnel arrived 90 seconds after the alarms went off, but they managed to escape. A burnt-out stolen Audi S5 that was found nearby is believed to have been involved with the theft. On 3 December 2018, four people were arrested on suspicion of the burglary. Appearance The tiara is covered with brilliant cushion- and briolette-cut diamonds. The briolettes were supplied to Cartier by the Duke of Portland and probably date from the 17th century. The centrepiece is the Portland Diamond, which dates from the 19th century.

The climate assessment process, with a report to be submitted to Congress every four years, is mandated by law through the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The report, which took two years to complete, is the fourth in a series of National Climate Assessments (NCA) which included NCA1 (2000), NCA2 (2009), and NCA3 (2014). Volume 1 of NCA4, \\"Climate Science Special Report\\" (CSSR) was released in October 2017. In the CSSR, researchers reported that \\"it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.\\" Volume 2, entitled \\"Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States\\", was released on November 23, 2018. According to NOAA, \\"human health and safety\\" and American \\"quality of life\\" is \\"increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change\\". Like the previous reports in this series, the NCA4 is a \\"stand-alone report of the state of science relating to climate change and its physical impacts\\". The authors say that without more significant mitigation efforts, there will be \\"substantial damages on the U.S. economy, human health, and the environment. Under scenarios with high emissions and limited or no adaptation, annual losses in some sectors are estimated to grow to hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century.\\" While the CSSR is \\"designed to be an authoritative assessment of the science of climate change\\" in the United States, it does not include policy recommendations. Background NASA Image of the Day October 26, 2017 Large atmospheric river, a river of rain, connecting Asia to North America. A February 2017 AR that ended California's 5-year drought, is featured on the CSSR NCA4 report's front cover.President George H.W. Bush signed the Global Change Research Act of 1990 into law on November 16, 1990, which established the United States Global Change Research Program with a mandate to understand and respond to global change, including the cumulative effects of human activities and natural processes on the environment, to promote discussions toward international protocols in global change research, and for other purposes.\\" Although the National Climate Assessment was mandated to release a report every four years, there have only been four reports since Global Change Research Act of 1990 was enacted. NCA4 Authors In the preparation of the NCA4, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), one of thirteen federal agencies comprising the USGCRP team, was the \\"administrative lead agency.\\" The other agencies included the DOA, DOC, DOD, DOE, HHS, DOI, DOS, DOT, EPA, NASA, NSF, Smithsonian Institution, and the USAID. The report was produced with the assistance of \\"1,000 people, including 300 leading scientists, roughly half from outside the government.\\" The Federal Science Steering Committee (SSC) for the CSSR included representatives from NOAA, NASA, and DOE, USGCRP and 3 Coordinating Lead Authors.All Federal Science Steering Committee (SSC) members were Federal employees during the development of this report. Process The Obama administration released a review draft of the CCSR with a public review period running from December 15, 2016 through February 3, 2017. Public policy The full text of NCA4, Vol. 1. While the CSSR is \\"designed to be an authoritative assessment of the science of climate change\\" in the United States, it does not include policy recommendations. On August 20, 2017, the Trump administration notified the 15-person Federal Advisory Committee for the Sustained National Climate AssessmentThe 15-person Federal Advisory Committee for the Sustained National Climate Assessment included \\"academics as well as local officials and corporate representatives.\\" Ben Friedman, NOAA's acting administrator \\"informed the committee‚Äôs chair that the agency would not renew the panel\\" on August 18, 2017. that he was dissolving the Federal Advisory Committee. The Federal Advisory Panel translating the NCA's scientific studies and findings into actionable public policy that individual states could implement to reduce emissions. According to an August 20, 2017 article in the Washington Post, the role of the Federal Advisory Panel for the National Climate Assessment was to assist \\"policymakers and private-sector officials incorporate the government‚Äôs climate analysis into long-term planning\\". The panel was tasked with translating dozens of studies and scientific revelations that constitute the National Climate Assessment into policy actions that states could use to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In January 2018 Andrew Cuomo, Governor of the State of New York, part of a coalition of States, reconvened a modified and limited version of the science advisory panel chaired by Columbia University's Earth Institute's Richard Moss. The States' panel cannot \\"replace federal support for science, including maintaining satellites and building better climate models\\" nor will it have any \\"sway over federal climate policy\\". Key findings An article in The Atlantic said that the report \\"warns, repeatedly and directly, that climate change could soon imperil the American way of life, transforming every region of the country, imposing frustrating costs on the economy, and harming the health of virtually every citizen.\\" In the section on mitigation, the report says that without more significant mitigation efforts, there will be \\"substantial damages on the U.S. economy, human health, and the environment. Under scenarios with high emissions and limited or no adaptation, annual losses in some sectors are estimated to grow to hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century.\\" The report cited a 2017 study, published in the journal Science, that estimated the economic damage to the U.S. economy in relation to increases in the global mean surface temperature (GMST). The report said that across the United States damages are \\"intensifying\\". The report which analyzed the \\"effects of climate change by U.S. region\\", emphasize[d] that \\"poor and marginalized communities\\" with be the most negatively \\"impacted by the intensifying storms and weather patterns caused by global warming.\\" =Volume 1= A 2018 CRS cited the October 2017 \\"Climate Science Special Report\\" CSSR: \\"Detection and attribution studies, climate models, observations, paleoclimate data, and physical understanding lead to high confidence (extremely likely) that more than half of the observed global mean warming since 1951 was caused by humans, and high confidence that internal climate variability played only a minor role (and possibly even a negative contribution) in the observed warming since 1951. The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the peer-reviewed detection and attribution literature, including in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report.\\" =Volume 2= According to Volume II, \\"Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States\\", \\"Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century.\\" The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was \\"administrative lead agency\\" in the preparation of the Fourth National Climate Assessment. Chapters (Volume 2) Volume 2 of NCA4 has fifteen chapters: Chapter 1: Our Globally Changing Climate Chapter 2: \\"Physical Drivers of Climate Change\\", Chapter 3: \\"Detection and Attribution of Climate Change\\", Chapter 4: \\"Climate Models, Scenarios, and Projections\\", Chapter 5: \\"Large-Scale Circulation and Climate Variability\\", Chapter 6: \\"Temperature Changes in the United States\\", Chapter 7: \\"Precipitation Change in the United States\\", Chapter 8: \\"Droughts, Floods, and Wildfire\\", Chapter 9: \\"Extreme Storms\\", Chapter 10: \\"Changes in Land Cover and Terrestrial Biogeochemistry\\", Chapter 11: \\"Arctic Changes and their Effects on Alaska and the Rest of the United States\\", Chapter 12: \\"Sea Level Rise\\", Chapter 13: \\"Ocean Acidification and Other Ocean Changes\\", Chapter 14: \\"Perspectives on Climate Change Mitigation\\", and Chapter 15: \\"Potential Surprises: Compound Extremes and Tipping Elements\\". Chapter one provided an overview. \\"Risks are often highest for those that are already vulnerable, including low-income communities, some communities of color, children, and the elderly...Climate change threatens to exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities that result in higher exposure and sensitivity to extreme weather and climate-related events and other changes.\\" Chapter 2, entitled \\"Our Changing Climate: Observations, Causes, and Future Change\\", reported on observed changes in the United States, such as \\"intensifying\\" and more frequent atmospheric rivers of rain that connect Asia with the United States, \\"[h]igh temperature extremes\\", increasing \\"heavy precipitation events\\", retreating glaciers and shrinking snow cover, the decline of sea ice, warming, sea level rising and increasing ocean acidification, more frequent flooding along the coastlines, lengthening growing seasons, and increasing wildfires. Reactions President Trump states \\"I've seen it, I've read some of it and it's fine.\\" and \\"I don't believe it.\\" In a November 26 scrum with reporters in Washington, DC, President Trump told reporters he had seen and read some of the report but he doesn't believe it. The White House dismissed the NCA4 as \\"inaccurate\\". White House spokesperson, Lindsay Walters said that the climate report was \\"largely based on the most extreme scenario\\". Walters called for future NCA reports to have a \\"more transparent and data-driven process that includes fuller information on the range of potential scenarios and outcomes\\". Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist from Texas Tech University said that Walters' claim was \\"demonstrably false\\". Hayhoe confirmed that the report \\"considers all scenarios, from those where we go carbon negative before end of century to those where carbon emissions continue to rise\\". The New York Times reported \\"White House officials made a calculation that Mr. Trump‚Äôs core base of supporters most likely would not care that its findings are so at odds with the president‚Äôs statements and policies.‚Äù Steven Milloy, a climate-change denier who served on Trump's EPA transition team, called the report a product of the deep state, adding \\"We don‚Äôt care. In our view, this is made-up hysteria anyway.\\" He noted that the Administration did not alter the report's findings but rather chose to release it the day after Thanksgiving \\"on a day when nobody cares, and hope it gets swept away by the next day‚Äôs news.\\" An article in The Atlantic called the report \\"massive\\", a \\"grave climate warning\\", and a \\"huge achievement for American science\\". Both the Washington Post and Vox described the report as \\"major\\". The Post described it as the Trump administration's climate report. Vox news described it as \\"dire\\". A November 23, 2018 Reuters article published in The New York Times cited the NCA4: \\"With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century - more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many U.S. states.\\" In July 2019 the Times cited the NCA4 in its own reporting to underscore the threat of sea level rise to the trillion-dollar coastal real estate market. Articles in Reuters/The New York Times, and the BBC, said that the warning issued by the 4th NCA \\"is at odds with the Trump administration's fossil fuels agenda.\\" An article in The Hill described the report as \\"damning\\", 'sounding the alarm' on the impact of climate change and contrasted the findings of NCA4 with doubts about climate change science expressed by President Trump. An article in The Verge called it a \\"bleak black Friday report.\\" An article in the Los Angeles Times said that the release of NCA4 was important in \\"tackling a misconception by many Americans that the changing climate doesn‚Äôt harm them personally.\\" The report shows \\"how climate change is already affecting each one of us, whether we live in Texas or Minnesota or Hawai‚Äôi or Florida.\\" Collin O‚ÄôMara, President of the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) issued a statement in which he called the timing of the Black Friday release by the White House of the NCA4 report‚Äîa month before its anticipated release‚Äîa \\"disgrace\\". O‚ÄôMara said that, \\"It‚Äôs an absolute disgrace to bury the truth about climate impacts in a year that saw hundreds of Americans die during devastating climate-fueled megafires, hurricanes, floods, and algal blooms.\\"The White House announced on November 21 that it would be releasing the NCA4 report findings on Black Friday.Collin O‚ÄôMara, NWF President's press release November 21, 2018: \\"It‚Äôs an absolute disgrace to bury the truth about climate impacts in a year that saw hundreds of Americans die during devastating climate-fueled megafires, hurricanes, floods, and algal blooms. Releasing the National Climate Assessment on Black Friday won‚Äôt obscure the fact that authorities are still identifying bodies in California‚Äôs unprecedented megafires, Florida is still dealing with toxic algae outbreaks fueled by warmer water, and Americans are still picking up the pieces from Hurricanes Florence and Michael and Typhoon Yutu that were worsened by climate change. Following upon the recent IPCC report, this analysis is a clarion call for Congress to address climate pollution and community resilience with absolute urgency.\\" In a November 23, 2018 press release, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) described how the 1,500-page report was based on \\"the best available science\\" and serves to assist the U.S. in \\"understand[ing], assess[ing], predict[ing] and respond[ing] to\\" climate change. It \\"examines the climate and economic impacts U.S. residents could expect if drastic action is not taken to address climate change\\".Brenda Ekwurzel is a NCA4 Report Author and Senior UCS Climate Scientist. In May 2019, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration was planning to make changes in the climate modeling methods used to create the next report which is due in 2022. Rather than project impacts of change to the end of the century as has been done in the past, they will project only to 2040. The administration is also planning to create a climate change review panel that would question the conclusions of the 2022 report. The Times reported that William Happer, who \\"would be a fringe figure even for climate skeptics\\", would head the panel.

After training in medicine and anthropology, he practiced as an emergency-room psychiatrist in Paris and started writing poetry and contemporary art reviews before publishing fiction. An early experience with cancer led him to write three books on the topic of illness: Dans la vall√©e des larmes, Soigner et Se survivre. Dans la vall√©e des larmes relates the experience of a thirty-five year old doctor coming to terms with a lymphoma whose diagnosis had been suddenly announced. Soigner is about a patient in remission who resumes his previous role of doctor and cares for his dying grandfather. Se survivre consists of seven meditations on the state of illness. Since these early writings, his work has developed in new directions: a hidden family drama that unravels during the expulsion of an undocumented person in France (Les Irr√©guliers), the agitation of a tree shaken by a storm as a metaphor for the loss of a loved one (Le grand vivant) and a narrative retracing Autr√©aux‚Äôs personal journey between medicine and literature (La Voix √©crite). Les Irr√©guliers was born out of the experience the author had when seeking news of a detained undocumented friend. Le grand vivant labels itself a ‚Äústanding poem‚Äù which brings to life the dying moments of a beloved grandfather, who until his last breath, had sheltered the presence of his deceased wife and was in the eyes of his grandson, a protective figure.‚Äù Le grand vivant was performed in 2015 the French Avignon theater festival.

Aesopica site Originally it illustrated the theme of friendship, which was later extended to cover political relations as well. The fable A lion keeps watch on a field in which two, three or four bulls are grazing. Knowing that they will group together to defend each other, the lion sows enmity between them so that they separate and he is able to kill them one by one. Early versions of the fable are in Greek, beginning with Babrius,Fable 42 and there is a later latinised version by Avianus.Fable 18 In the 4th century CE the rhetorician Themistius introduced a variant in which it is a fox that brings discord so that the lion can profit from it.Francisco Rodr√≠guez Adrados, History of the Graeco-latin Fable, Brill 2003, Vol.III, p.293 The moral given the story was generally to distrust a foe and hold fast to friends, but in the Syntipas version it was later given a political turn: ‚ÄúThis fable shows that the same is true of cities and people: when they are in agreement with one another, they do not allow their enemies to defeat them, but if they refuse to cooperate, it is an easy matter for their enemies to destroy them.‚ÄùFable 59 A similar sentiment was taken up in the collection illustrated by the English artist Francis Barlow in 1665, where the story is applied to state alliances.Fable 3 The lesson of holding fast to an alliance against the common foe was later repeated in a poem often reprinted during the American War of Independence, where there are 13 bulls in the field, the number of states in revolt.The American Museum, Or Universal Magazine, Vol.4, pp.384-5 A much longer poem, praising friendship and describing how the fox brings division among the bulls through lies and flattery, accompanied the fable of \\"The Four Bulls\\" in Thomas Bewick‚Äôs illustrated edition of 1818.pp.293-9 The poem had been taken from the series written by John Hawkesworth under the pseudonym H.

His case had great prominence in the national media and raised a debate on the question of incapability of criminals understanding the consequences of their acts.  Capture  On November 16, 1994, in Vicenza, Stevanin picked up a prostitute named Gabriele Musger in his Volvo 240, offering her money to have sex and take pictures of her. After several hours of extreme sexual games, the prostitute tried to escape through the window of a bathroom and later refused to take other pictures, resulting in being threatened with a knife by Stevanin. To save her life, she offered Gianfranco all her savings (about 25 million lires) if he let her go,Traces of two disappears in the house of horrors Repubblica.it and the maniac accepted; however, the money was at Musger's house and then the two got into his car to go get it. At toll booth at Vicenza, Stevanin stopped to pay the toll, and at that moment the prostitute managed to get out of the car, go to a police car and report her client for sexual violence.'Used' As a Slave, Saved by Money Repubblica.it. The police arrested him for sexual assault, extortion, and possession of a toy gun without the regular red cap. Following this event, he was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months imprisonment.Stevanin wounded in the throat in the criminal asylum. The farmer in the 'casolare degli horrors', accused of having slaughtered six women, was attacked by an immigrant inmate  Investigations  During searches of his house, investigators found prohibited pornographic material (including over 7000 photographs personally taken by Stevanin and his partners), anatomy books, boxes containing pubic hair and a file containing information on all his partners. Although the police consider Stevanin the only one in the group who violated and attempted extortion, investigators began to suspect more serious crimes after finding objects belonging to a woman named Biljana Pavlovic, whom has been missing since August 1994, and Claudia Pulejo. The two girls were also mentioned in Stevanin's files. The man justified himself by saying that he had short relationships with them and that the clothes were just a token of love that the girls had left him. On July 3, 1995, a farmer from Terrazzo found a sack containing the remains of a corpse in a plot near Stevanin's house. Gianfranco became a murder suspect, and the magistrate sent some bulldozers to look for other bodies. On November 12, 1995, the body of another woman was found; this time the body was also found in a sack,A Plastic Bag Found The Trace That Leads To Assassin Repubblica.it. but on this occasion the discovery took place in a land owned by Stevanin, with the DNA test unequivocally showing that the body was that of Biljana Pavlovic. On December 1, 1995, a third body was found, that of Claudia Pulejo. Archive of lastampa.it. Stevanin was questioned by the investigators but his attitude was controversial: at times he seemed to remember something, and then denied it immediately, claiming that he had an empty memory.Signor Giudice, Parlero Repubblica.it. Other murders attributed to him include the murder of Austrian prostitute Roswita Adlassnig, who had been missing for a few months and present both in Stevanin's photos and his files, and another murder of an unidentified woman with whom he evidently engaged in a sexual act with while she was dead. In September 24, 1996 (after the partial confession of Stevanin), another unidentified body was found in the Adige. After a DNA test, the body was recognized as that of Blazenca Smolijo.  Confessions  On July 19, 1996, Stevanin decided to confess and claimed to have dismembered the bodies of four women, but that their murders weren't premeditated, as they had died during extreme sexual relations,'I Am Death After a Sex Game' Repubblica.it. or, in the case of Pulejo, due a heroin overdose. Regarding the unidentified corpse, he stated that she was a student whose name and face he did not remember, saying he had met her only three or four times. Stevanin later claimed that he acted without knowing what he was doing, as if his actions were just dreams.  Trial  After several sessions of psychiatric examinations, Stevanin was declared processable and able to understand the consequences of his actions, with the experts saying that he was mentally capable, intelligent (with an IQ of 114) and a skilled computist.The Monster of Terrazzo. \\"Stevanin able to understand and want\\" The defense experts tried to challenge the psychiatric report, stating that all the disturbances of Gianfranco Stevanin are due to a previous motorcycle accident that almost cost him his life.

The first sentence by the Court of Assizes of Verona, on January 29, 1998, condemned Gianfranco Stevanin to life imprisonment, of which 3 years in total daytime isolation. In January 1999, Stevanin sold his house and all the land he owned to partially compensate the families of the victims.

The final sentence was announced on March 23, 2001: the Appellate Court of Venice declared that Gianfranco Stevanin was capable of understanding his crimes, which is why his sentence was automatically confirmed to life imprisonment.

He won three Soviet ice hockey championships as a player, and was later an ice hockey referee at eight World Championships. He was the general secretary of the Soviet Union Ice Hockey Federation for 17 years, and negotiated Soviet participation in the Summit Series. He was posthumously inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame. Early life Starovoytov was born 16 December 1915. He started playing ice hockey and bandy as a youth in Smolensk during the 1930s. He later played as a defenceman for HC CSKA Moscow from 1946 to 1951. He was part of the championship team in 1948, 1949 and 1950, and scored 10 goals in 50 games in the Soviet championships. He was coached by Anatoly Tarasov, and played with other notable teammates including, Boris Afanasiev, Aleksandr Komarov, Grigory Mkrtychan, Nikolai Sologubov and Dmitry Ukolov. Starovoytov later served as an ice hockey referee in the top tier of Soviet hockey from 1951 to 1969. He officiated at the Ice Hockey World Championships eight times including, 1955, the 1956 Winter Olympics, 1957, 1958, 1961, 1963, 1965 and 1966. He was named one of the top ten referees in Soviet hockey in 12 different seasons. He was also a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) referee council from 1969 to 1986. Administration career Starovoytov served as the general secretary of the Soviet Union Ice Hockey Federation from 1969 to 1986. During that period, the Soviet Union national ice hockey team won three gold medals at the Winter Olympic Games, and 12 gold medals at the Ice Hockey World Championships. He negotiated with Joe Kryczka of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association for the Soviet national team to play the Canada men's national ice hockey team in what became known as the 1972 Summit Series. The agreement was signed and announced on 18 April 1972, at the Hotel International Prague during the 1972 World Ice Hockey Championships, and approved by Bunny Ahearne and Fred Page of the IIHF. Starovoytov agreed to the eight-game series feeling that his Soviet players would be able to defeat Canadian professionals from the National Hockey League. His confidence was evident from an interview with journalist Red Fisher, where Starovoytov believed his country could win all eight games. Canada prevailed with four wins and a draw in eight games, but he was not deterred in having another competition. During the 1974 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, Starovoytov approached Canadian leaders Jack Devine and Gordon Juckes, regarding having another series. The 1974 Summit Series was agreed to be a six-games series versus professionals from the World Hockey Association, but was later extended to eight games. The Soviets took the rematch with four wins and three draws in the eight games. Later life and honors Starovoytov received the Olympic Order in 1986 for contributions to ice hockey. He was made an honorary life member of the IIHF in 1986, and then was posthumously inducted as builder into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 1997, after he died 22 March 1997. The Kontinental Hockey League annually honors its referee of the year with the Andrei Starovoytov Award, also called the \\"Golden Whistle\\".

Opened in 1870 by the Jersey Railway, it was in passenger operation until the line closed in 1936. History The Jersey Railway first opened in 1870, running services between Saint Helier and Saint Aubin with trains stopping at the three intermediate stations, First Tower, Millbrook and Beaumont. The first trial service ran on 28 September, and on the following day a train carrying 300 invited guests departed from Saint Helier. The line was formally opened to passengers on 17 October with a grand ceremonial opening followed by a banquet at Noirmont Manor, the residence of the contractor, Mr E. Pickering. On the opening day, 4000 single journeys were made on the line. The station as originally built had two platforms under a trainshed. A hotel opened at the station in 1871. In 1885, a third platform was built to serve trains on the extension to Corbi√®re. In 1922 the trainshed was demolished due to its poor condition and replaced with canopies over the platforms. Closure On 15 October 1936, a fire damaged the station and destroyed most of the railway's rolling stock. The company sold all of its land and stations to the States of Jersey for ¬£25,000 in 1937.

The largest and only shareholder is the Covenant of the Merciful Sisters of St. Vincent de Paul and the company bottles around 580 million mineral water products every year. History Around the year 280 AD, according to legend, the spa of Bad Adelholzen was discovered by the Roman preacher St. Primus. On his return to Rome, he was captured along with his brother Felicianus by butchers of Emperor Diocletian and killed. The name of the healing spring is still traced back to the Roman martyr. According to the legend of the saints, Primus, in addition to teaching people in the Christian faith, also healed the sick through prayer and with the restorative power of water. In the 10th century, the spring came into the possession of the archbishops of Salzburg. In 1875, the Adelholzener spring water was first sold and by 1895, the mineral water was being shipped nationwide. At the beginning of the 20th century, the spa and bathing business in Bad Adelholzen went bankrupt and in 1907, the Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy of St. Vinzenz von Pau, based in Munich, acquired the spa and bottling plants. In the following years, the production and administration business was modernized and expanded. In 1919, the first electric bottling plant was completed. After the Second World War in 1946 the place was awarded the official recognition as a spa by the Bavarian State Ministry of the Interior. In 1994, the business was renamed Adelholzener Alpen and two years later, built a new warehouse and administrative building. In 1998, the company began using its first returnable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottling plant and in 2001 was the company launched their oxygenated water range, Active O2, in Germany which was accompanied by the brand's first television commercial. In 2013, a new glass bottling plant was built, with a capacity of up to 28,000 bottles per hour and four years later, Adelholzener's seventh bottling line was opened with a capacity of 35,000 reusable PET bottles per hour. The company has a market presence in more than 20 countries, the largest market being in Germany and Japan. The profit made from the mineral water is used to support charities and social institutions around Bavaria through the work of the Covenant. Sponsorship Adelholzener had sponsored Sauber Formula 1 cars from 2003 to 2005, including on the cars of Felipe Massa, Nick Heidfeld and Jacques Villenueve.
