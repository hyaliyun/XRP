She is a professor of mathematics at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and has been the editor-in-chief of the Pi Mu Epsilon Journal since 1999. Education and career Servatius is originally from Graz in Austria. As a student at an all-girl gymnasium in Graz that specialized in language studies rather than mathematics, her interest in mathematics was sparked by her participation in a national mathematical olympiad, and she went on to earn master's degrees in mathematics and physics at the University of Graz. She became a high school mathematics and science teacher in Leibnitz. She moved to the US in 1981, to begin doctoral studies at Syracuse University. She completed her Ph.D. in 1987, and joined the Worcester Polytechnic Institute faculty in the same year. Her dissertation, Planar Rigidity, was supervised by Jack Graver. Contributions While still in Austria, Servatius began working on combinatorial group theory, and her first publication (appearing while she was a graduate student) is in that subject. She switched to the theory of structural rigidity for her doctoral research, and later became the author (with Jack Graver and Herman Servatius) of the book Combinatorial Rigidity (1993). Another well-cited paper of hers in this area characterizes the planar Laman graphs, the minimally rigid graphs that can be embedded without crossings in the plane, as the graphs of pseudotriangulations, partitions of a plane region into subregions with three convex corners studied in computational geometry. Servatius is also the co- editor of a book on matroid theory. With Toma≈æ Pisanski she wrote the book Configurations from a Graphical Viewpoint (2013), on configurations of points and lines in the plane with the same number of points touching each two lines and the same number of lines touching each two points. Other topics in her research include graph duality and the triconnected components of infinite graphs.

Location The power station would be located across River Tana, in Embu County, sandwiched between Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power Station upstream and Kiambere Hydroelectric Power Station downstream. Karura Power Station, is about downstream of Kindaruma Power Station. This location is approximately , by road, north-east of Nairobi, the capital and largest city of Kenya. Overview The power station is a run of river, hydropower installation, with capacity of 90 Megawatts. The design calls for the waters of River Tana to be diverted through a \\"dug-out channel\\" and then delivered to the power- generation site, thereby reducing the \\"displacement of communities\\". Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen), a company, owned 70 percent by the government of Kenya, is the developer and owner of this power station. The development, decided upon circa 2012, is being developed to stabilize the national electricity grid with increased hydro-power, in view of the increased intermittent sources in the country's energy mix, including solar and wind. Feasibility and ESIA studies were conducted in the 2009 to 2012 time-frame. Karura and Mutonga were two locations that were identified as potential sites for hydro-power station development. Construction timeline , the development was entering the tendering process, after which the construction cost and timeline would be determined. As of January 2020, the dam was in its early planning stage, and was expected to be operational by 2025.

After running unopposed in the primary election, he was the Republican candidate for Illinois's 3rd congressional district in the November 2018 midterm elections, losing to Democrat Dan Lipinski. Early life and career Jones was born in Beloit, Wisconsin, to Lillian Jones, a Sunday School teacher and Arthur Joseph Jones Sr., a factory worker and World War II veteran. He served in the United States Army in the Vietnam War. He studied at University of Wisconsin‚ÄìWhitewater from 1974 and majored in political science and journalism. Jones is an independent insurance broker who worked in commission sales for large insurance companies for 25 years. Politics=Affiliations= Jones was a member of the National Socialist White People's Party for eight years and describes himself as a former leader of the American Nazi Party, the NSWPP's former name. He has also been a member of the Populist Party, a far-right political party active in the 1980s and 1990s. =Candidacy= A perennial candidate, Jones has run for various elected offices since 1976, but has never won an office. In that year, Jones unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1987, he unsuccessfully ran for alderman of the 13th Ward of Chicago. As of 2018, Jones had run for the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican eight times; in 1984, 1992, 1996, 1998, 2006, 2008, 2012, and 2018. In 1989 Jones had attempted to run for mayor of Chicago, but was denied inclusion on the Republican primary ballot due to issues regarding his candidature petition.https://app.chicagoelections.com/documents/Electoral- Board/document_1462.PDF In 2017, Jones declared his intent to run for the Republican nomination for Congress from Illinois's 3rd congressional district in 2018; he was the only declared candidate of that party. His candidacy was repudiated by the Illinois Republican Party and the Republican National Committee. RNC spokesperson Michael Ahrens stated, \\"We condemn this candidate and his hateful rhetoric in the strongest possible terms\\". Jones won the primary unopposed on March 20, 2018 and moved on to face Democratic incumbent Dan Lipinski in the general election. Following his primary victory, Republican party officials encouraged members not to vote for Jones. Despite the GOP disavowing him, 26.2 percent of voters still voted for him in the general election on November 6, 2018, as he lost by more than 47 points.\\"Illinois election results 2018\\" The Washington Post. Jones ran for Congress in Illinois's 3rd congressional district again in 2020 and was described as a \\"fake Republican\\" by the party whose nomination he was attempting to gain. One of the party's digital ads ran with the slogan \\"Say No To The Nazi\\". He came a poor third in the eventual result of the primaries. =Views= Jones is a white nationalist and Holocaust denier. His 2018 candidate website calls the Holocaust a \\"racket.\\" He has claimed that the Holocaust was \\"the biggest, blackest lie in history\\" and \\"nothing more than an international extortion racket by the Jews.\\" Jones does not support interracial marriage or integration in public schools. In 1993, Jones was filmed in a fight with Milwaukee Alderman Michael McGee Jr. on The Jerry Springer Show. Jones also ‚Äúsaluted‚Äù Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan for his views about Jews, as well as referring to Jews as the enemy.https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/12/us/white-supremacists-voice-support- of-farrakhan.html A neo-Nazi, Jones appears in a photo captioned: \\"Jones was a guest speaker at the event organized by the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, based in North Carolina\\"; the image is in a slideshow on his own official candidate website. The same slideshow has another image (captioned \\"Arthur Jones speaking in Harrisburg Penn., on November 5, 2016\\") showing him among black-clothed men who hold a National Socialist Movement banner and carry shields marked with the neo-Nazi circle-cross emblem. The same slideshow has an image showing Jones speaking amid Aryan Nations emblems (caption: \\"Art Jones speaking at the Aryan Nations 2014 World Congress in Converse, La.\\") Jones has attended many rallies commemorating Adolf Hitler or supporting white supremacy. Jones considers himself a \\"white racialist\\" and has stated \\"I will work with the [Ku Klux] Klan, with socialists‚ÄîI exclude communists of course‚Äîany patriotic organization that is in general agreement with my beliefs and principles\\". In 2016, he was a supporter of Donald Trump for president. Jones said in an interview then, \\"I agree with a lot of what Mr. Trump has to say [...] He's his own man. I like the fact that doesn't have to go hat in hand to Jewish billionaires to get money\\". In February 2018, Jones nonetheless said President Trump \\"surrounded himself with hordes of Jews\\", and regrets his 2016 vote. At a neo-Nazi meeting in Kentucky, Jones said that Trump \\"surrounded himself with hordes of Jews including a Jew in his own family, that punk named Jared Kushner\\", and moved on to say \\"I'm sorry I voted for the son of a bitch, pardon my English\\" and that Trump was \\"nothing but a puppet ‚Ä¶ this Jew-loving fool\\", all of which was also captured on video. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, it takes thousands more signatures to get ballot- approved as an independent candidate than as a Republican; Jones therefore ran in 2016 as a Republican, but the party disavowed him and found technical reasons for removing him from past ballots. Again according to the Sun-Times, Jones took countermeasures in 2017 and 2018 for which the party was unprepared, and so he appeared on their ballot despite official Republican disapproval.

Retrieved on February 6, 2018. = Relationship between health and education = One of Glewwe's main research areas concerns the relationship between health and education. For example, he (with Hanan Jacoby) finds early childhood malnutrition - and not borrowing constraints or the rationing of school places - to be the likely cause of delayed enrollment in primary school in Ghana,Glewwe, P., Jacoby, H. (1995). An Economic Analysis of Delayed Primary School Enrollment in a Low Income Country: The Role of Early Childhood Nutrition. Review of Economics and Statistics, 77(1), pp. 156-169. and documents (with Jacoby and Elizabeth M. King) how malnutrition among young children in the Philippines impairs their academic achievements by delaying the age at which they enroll into school and causing them to learn more slowly, though not by decreasing their effort exerted at school (in terms of attendance, homework, etc.).Glewwe, P., Jacoby, H.G., King, E.M. (2001). Early childhood nutrition and academic achievement: a longitudinal analysis. Journal of Public Economics, 81(3), pp. 345-368. Looking into the link between child health and maternal education, Glewwe argues based on evidence from Morocco that mothers' health knowledge, which is generally correlated with (though not necessarily caused by) their schooling, is probably the main pathway how maternal education achieves its strongly positive impact on child health and nutrition in developing countries, which consequently suggests large public health payoffs to female health education in school.Glewwe, P. (1999). Why Does Mother's Schooling Raise Child Health in Developing Countries? Evidence from Morocco. Journal of Human Resources, 34(1), pp. 124-159. = Impact of the quality of the supply of education on learning = Since the early 2000s, Glewwe has used randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in order to investigate the impact of the quality of the supply of education, e.g. in terms of school supplies or the quality of teaching, on learning outcomes. For example, Glewwe finds (with Michael Kremer, Sylvie Moulin, and Eric Zitzewitz) that in Kenya neither the provision of textbooks nor of flipcharts was effective in raising average student scores and that generally only the best students were able to take advantages of the improvement in school supplies. This in turn raises the question of whether the emphasis of many developing countries' (strongly centralized) education systems on top-down improvements to the supply of education may be guided rather by elite bias than by a concern for broad increases in students' learning outcomes.Glewwe, P. et al. (2004). Retrospective vs. prospective analyses of school inputs: the case of flip charts in Kenya. Journal of Development Economics, 74(1), pp. 251-268.Glewwe, P., Kremer, M., Moulin, S. (2009). Many Children Left Behind? Textbooks and Test Scores in Kenya. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 1(1), pp. 112-135. In another RCT, Glewwe (with Michael Kremer and Nauman Ilias) finds that rewarding primary school teachers in Kenya based on students' test scores and penalizing them based on their students not attending the exam leads teachers to increase the number of test preparation sessions (but not teacher attendance or homework assignments), which then increases students' test scores and exam participation, but is ineffective in reducing dropout rates.Glewwe, P., Ilias, N., Kremer, M. (2010). Teacher Incentives. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 2(3), pp. 205-227. Earlier on, having found school characteristics in Ghana to be highly correlated with student achievement, e.g. via average grade attainment, Glewwe (with Jacoby) had argued that improvements to school quality, such as repairs of classrooms, may be a cost-effective investment into education in Ghana relative to the provision of more teaching materials and better trained teachers.Glewwe, P., Jacoby, H. (1994). Student Achievement and Schooling Choice in Low-Income Countries: Evidence from Ghana. Journal of Human Resources, 29(1), pp. 843-864. = Returns to schooling, determinants of household vulnerability, and willingness to pay for education = Glewwe's other findings include the following: * That many pre-1990s estimates of rates of returns to schooling are significantly biased because they fail to account for differences in ability and school quality and, even if accurate, may provide poor guidance to education policy compared to rates of return to investments in school quality;Glewwe, P. (1996). The relevance of standard estimates of rates of return to schooling for education policy: A critical assessment. Journal of Development Economics, 51(2), pp. 267-290. * That the vulnerability of households in Peru to welfare decreases during macroeconomic shocks decreases in education and access to foreign transfer networks, increases if households are headed by women or have more children, and is hardly mitigated by Peru's social security programme (with Gillette Hall);Glewwe, P., Hall, G. (1998). Are some groups more vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks than others? Hypothesis tests based on panel data from Peru. Journal of Development Economics, 56(1), pp. 181-206. * That the willingness to pay for schooling in households in rural Peru is high enough at all income levels to cover the operating costs of new schools in their villages, thus suggesting that increasing school fees to raise revenue for educational improvements in developing countries may be feasible (with Paul Gertler).Gertler, P., Glewwe, P. (1990). The willingness to pay for education in developing countries: Evidence from rural Peru. Journal of Public Economics, 42(3), pp. 251-275. = Views on priorities for education policy in developing countries = Finally, taking stock of the literature on the supply of education in developing countries, Glewwe (with Michael Kremer) criticizes that, although school enrollment rates have risen rapidly in the developing world between 1960 and 2000, dropout rates remain high and learning outcomes disappointing, and thus argues that the primary policy question should be which policies most effectively improve learning, with RCTs as the preferred tool to conduct that investigation.Glewwe, P., Kremer, M. (2006). Schools, Teachers, and Education Outcomes in Developing Countries. In: Hanushek, E., Welch, F. (eds.). Handbook of the Economics of Education (vol. 2). Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 945-1017. More recently, Glewwe has emphasized (with Karthik Muralidharan) that educational spending in developing countries could be much more cost effective, as improvements to pedagogy (e.g. remedial classes for children lagging behind) as well as improvements to school governance and teacher accountability tend to be much more cost effective than mere (yet widespread) increases in \\"standard\\" school inputs (e.g. more books); by contrast, interventions aimed at increasing the demand for education by raising students' returns to (or decreasing households' costs of) school enrollment and effort are also generally effective in improving learning outcomes, but vary widely in terms of cost effectiveness.Glewwe, P., Muralidharan, K.

As of June 2019, the firm was reportedly managing $8.5 billion in structured products and other credit instruments. History The firm was co-founded in 1994 by Mike Vranos and Laurence Penn with funding from Ziff brothers investments. By the end of 1995 the firm had become a three-fund operation with a variety of assets. Ellington was affected by the Long-Term Capital Management debacle in 1998. For a few days in mid-October, the firm sold mortgage securities to lower its funds' leverage. The firm issued a public statement describing its borrowings to quell public fears, which was considered unusual for hedge funds at the time. It clarified that although it was meeting margin calls by unloading hundreds of millions of dollars in assets over a two-day period, losses were limited. One report suggests some of Ellington's hedge funds may have temporarily lost around 25% of their value as they liquidated $2 billion in assets after allegedly missing a margin call from UBS. However, from its December 1994 inception through April 2004, the firm delivered a composite annualized return of 15.4%, after fees. Notable investments Various of Ellington's funds have invested in distressed mortgage-backed securities over time. By 2004 their $3 billion in hedge fund assets included mortgage derivatives. In October 2007, as the future credit performance of residential mortgages became increasingly uncertain, one of the funds is reported to have fallen in value by 22% and to have temporarily suspended redemptions pending greater clarity around valuations. As of 2007, Ellington Management's assets included $1.2 billion in a managed account, $5.4 billion in hedge funds and private accounts, and almost $23 billion in collateralized debt obligations. In 2014 an office was opened in London, England in order to expand into the European market. Subsidiaries In June 2007, Ellington Financial LLC was launched. The offering primarily targeted investments in non-agency mortgage-backed securities. The deal was underwritten by Friedman Billings Ramsey and although originally slated for a $750 million offering, evolving market conditions only allowed for a $250 million capital raise. Before the private placement, a New York Times columnist noted that a portion of the private placement might be used to purchase risky tranches from bankrupt subprime lender New Century Financial Corporation and noted the potential difficulty in valuing such instruments. In October 2010, Ellington Financial LLC went public, debuting on the NYSE. According to its public filings, Ellington Financial invests primarily in non- agency mortgage-backed securities, but also holds agency pools and other mortgage-related securities, and had a total return of 59% between its August 2007 inception and the end of 2011. Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT, chaired and founded by Mike Vranos, went public on the NYSE after its IPO in late 2013, trading under the ticker symbol EARN.

Since the magazine was released with either a cassette or a CD, its tagline was \\"The marriage of music and magazine\\". History The magazine was conceived by free-lance music journalist Ric Levine in early 1985 while at a restaurant. The magazine contained interviews, reviews, and opinions regarding musicians associated with progressive rock, jazz fusion, and new age, though the magazine would stray to other categories deemed \\"innovative\\". The magazine also contained a complimentary cassette that includes the music covered within the magazine. In regards to the Magazine's packing, Levine told Guitar Player that the packing for the first issue \\"looks like a videocassette box, which caused some confusion\\" and that the packing was expensive at the time; the subsequent issues featured a blister pack where both the magazine and cassette are visible. Levine, alongside his wife Deborah, attempted to publish the magazine nationwide. At the peak of the magazine's run, Cymbiosis was available in 37 states and in 13 countries. However, in 1988, Levine put the magazine out of the market after four issues to rethink his efforts. In December 1988, Levine reintroduced the magazine format with CDs instead of cassettes, released the magazine as a CD booklet, and increased the length of the magazine from 48 pages to 130 pages; the magazine was also distributed by A&M; Records. Only one issue was released under the new format. Reception Flipside wrote that the magazine's steep cover price would \\"appeal only to yuppies who could afford it\\" and that the magazine features \\"very few strong hooks\\". However, Flipside opined that the musicians featured in the magazine are great for their genre.

It is the 25th overall episode of the series and is written by Lakshmi Sundaram and directed by Rebecca Asher. It aired on Fox in the United States on October 12, 2014. The show revolves around the fictitious 99th precinct of the New York Police Department in Brooklyn and the officers and detectives that work in the precinct. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is an immature yet very talented detective in the precinct with an astounding record of crimes solved, putting him in a competition with fellow detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). The precinct's status changes when the Captain is retiring and a new commanding officer, Cpt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) is appointed as the newest Captain. This creates a conflict between Jake and Holt over their respective methods in the field. In the episode, with Holt and Terry off due to a meeting in a plaza, the gang decides to assemble their annual \\"Jimmy Jab Games\\" with Jake wanting the number of Rosa's friend if he wins. Meanwhile, Boyle and Gina discover that Hitchcock has a tape that reveals their relationship and set to take it from him. The episode was seen by an estimated 4.51 million household viewers and gained a 2.2/6 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised the episode's similitude to Office Olympics from The Office and Andy Samberg's performance. Plot Holt and Terry (Terry Crews) are assigned to a meeting at 1 Police Plaza, leaving the precinct without them for a few hours before they are to defend the President of Serbia's motorcade. The gang then decides to do the \\"Jimmy Jab Games\\". The competition's name comes from Jake's mispronunciation of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who Jake also believed was the \\"King of Iraq\\" rather than President of Iran. Jake makes a bet with Rosa (Stephanie Beatriz): if Jake wins, he gets Rosa's friend's phone number (which she had earlier refused to give to him); if he loses, he will pay $200 to Rosa and never ask for any more phone numbers. In the first game the participants must eat expired Chinese food. Boyle is the first one eliminated, and Scully (Joel McKinnon Miller), the winner, leaves due to food poisoning. The second game, a foot race in anti-bomb suits, ends with Hitchcock (Dirk Blocker) eliminated. The next task involves Jake, Rosa and Amy going undercover before anyone recognizes them. Amy seems to have lost, but Rosa fails to convince a single person, eliminating herself. However, Rosa offers Jake to cancel the bet as it's clear he's in love with Amy. Jake rebuffs this. The final task involves them running through the precinct to complete various activities. Jake gets stuck in the final activity, giving Amy the victory. Her victory is interrupted by Holt's and Terry's return, and Holt orders them to stop. Jake later reveals to Rosa that he purposely let Amy win, to which she decides to give him her friend's number in order to help him move on from Amy. While away from the office, Holt faces his nemesis Deputy Chief Wuntch (Kyra Sedgwick) to get $1200 for new kits to help combat a new, more potent form of ecstasy. Wuntch tricks Holt into asking for and accepting a high budget for a drug task force that will end up at a loss if the operation goes awry. Meanwhile, Gina (Chelsea Peretti) orders Boyle to snare a tape that reveals their relationship from an oblivious but ultimately vindictive Hitchcock. After fighting with him, Boyle gets the tape and destroys it. Reception=Viewers= In its original American broadcast, \\"The Jimmy Jab Games\\" was seen by an estimated 4.51 million household viewers and gained a 2.2/6 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a 36% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 3.31 million viewers with a 1.6/4 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 2.2 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 6 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, Brooklyn Nine-Nine was the third most watched show on FOX for the night, beating Mulaney and Family Guy but behind The Simpsons, fifth on its timeslot and fifth for the night, behind Once Upon a Time, The Simpsons, The OT, and NBC Sunday Night Football. =Critical reviews= \\"The Jimmy Jab Games\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. LaToya Ferguson of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"A-\\" grade and wrote, \\"'The Jimmy Jab Games' isn't a revolutionary episode of television. But it is consistently funny, and sometimes it's important to remember that 'funny' is the true end goal of sitcoms. (It has something to do with what the 'com' in sitcom means, I think.) Even with the Peralta/Amy situation in full effect, it never actually slows down the episode as much as it draws attention to the show's possible flaw. It does allow for more Peralta/Diaz interaction, which has always been welcome, especially in a post 'Pontiac Bandit' world.\\" Jackson McHenry of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \\"'The Jimmy Jab Games' manages to grow out of The Offices shadow by letting its characters be self-aware in a way that the employee‚Äôs of Dunder-Mifflin never were. Jim and Pam were both afraid to tell anyone about their feelings, but Jake and Amy discuss theirs openly, with their friends and each other. By the end of this episode, Jake knows what he wants, but he also knows what is the more grown-up thing to do. Brooklyn Nine-Nines less about realizing what's right there in front of you, and more about learning that no matter how much you want them, some things are out of your control.\\" Allie Pape from Vulture gave the show a 3 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \\"Some of my favorite B99 episodes so far have been the ones without any crimes involved ('The Party,' 'Tactical Village'), just letting the cast play with each other. This is how you get Peralta lighting a bagel on fire as Scully, attired in a Viking hat and carrying a hockey stick, sings opera. Every episode of this show could consist of new Jimmy Jab events, and I probably wouldn‚Äôt get bored.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, \\"'Jimmy Jab Games' is a pretty straight lift of the plot of 'Office Olympics' from The Office season 2, but I‚Äôm okay with that for a few reason. First, Mike Schur wrote 'Office Olympics,' so if he wants his writers here to import the nine- year-old idea into the Brooklyn Nine-Nine universe, more power to him. Second, this episode expanded on the idea by incorporating more of what we know about the ensemble and their gifts (like Scully's opera singing) and by acknowledging all the weird toys a bored detective squad would have to play with.\\" Andy Crump of Paste gave the episode a 7.1 and wrote, \\"Fortunately, 'The Jimmy Jab Games' finds plenty of opportunity to make up for its cathartic lapses with hijinks. It is amazing that anybody manages to get anything done in the 99th, but that's nothing new to us; slightly less familiar is the notion of stakes, at least not the sort of stakes that require the prank wars, and this general lackadaisical approach to work might need to come to an end. Brooklyn Nine-Nine isn't a dramatic cop show, of course, so it's allowed a bit of leeway as far as it concerns reality, but we're back on track with the through line about Holt's attempts to whip his crew, and his legacy, into shape. Too bad that won't involve Sedgwick from here on out, but it‚Äôs heartening to see the show commit to its arc all around.\\" ReferencesExternal links 2014 American television episodes Brooklyn Nine-Nine (season 2) episodes ","title":"The Jimmy Jab Games"},{"id":"56509129","text":"The M89 class were a planned series of destroyers (torpilleur d'escadre) for the French Navy (Marine Nationale). Although initially designed in 1913, the scheduled construction of the two new destroyers was suspended due to the outbreak of World War I before either ship could be laid down. The two destroyers had not yet been given names, being known only by their planned construction numbers, M89 and M90. Design and development The design of the M89-class destroyers originates in the promulgation of the Statut Naval (Naval Law) of 1912 by the French Minister of Marine on 30 March 1912. The new law set out restructure and strengthen the French navy in the face of the rapid developments in naval technology and fleet size by France's continental neighbours, Germany and the United Kingdom with an emphasis on new classes of ship such as \\"super-dreadnought\\" battleships, light cruisers and larger, more heavily armed destroyers. All types of ship the French navy lacked. The Naval Law set out an ambitious goal for twenty-eight battleships, ten scout cruisers, fifty-two destroyers (fleet torpedo boats), ninety-four submarines and ten vessels for distant stations to be in service by the year 1920. Originally the fifty-two fleet torpedo boats was planned to include the ten 300-tonne and the 450-tonne , , and destroyers. This troubled the Chief of the French Naval General Staff (Directeur du Service des travaux), Vice Admiral Pierre Ange Marie Le Bris. There were serious concerns about the seaworthiness of the 300 and 450-tonne class destroyers to act as far-ranging 'fleet' vessels. It also meant that after the completion of the twenty (eventually twenty-one with the addition of ) 800-tonne , and ships, there would be no new French destroyers built for several years, which would likely create another technological gap between France and her neighbours. The Naval General Staff proposed a new class of 1,500-tonne destroyer, nine initially to complete the required fifty-two ship strong destroyer fleet mandated by the 1912 Naval Law. A further twenty-three would be built to eventually phase out the 300 and 450-tonne classes of destroyers by 1920 while maintaining a fleet of fifty-two destroyers. =1914 project= Design work began in 1913 by the Naval Constructors Department (Service technique des constructions navales, STCN) on a new 1,500-tonne torpilleur d'escadre (fleet torpedo boat). The design focused on combat with other destroyers, an emphasis was placed on an expected combat distance of , with fast, unstable, and unarmoured ships. The STCN committee recommended above all else, larger calibre guns compared to previous French destroyer designs, a gun was preferred. In the Spring of 1914, French arms manufacturer, Schneider-Creusot proposed production of a short /25 gun, with a sliding breech for the new ships. Other common areas of protection such as the conning tower and deck armour thickness are not known. The final study was approved by the STCN on 9 June 1914. The final design was for a 1,530-ton ship, nearly twice as heavy as France's previous batch of 800-tonne destroyers. The armament would consist of two single mounted Schneider cannons, mounted fore and aft. Torpedo armament would consist of a total of eight torpedo tubes, two central, triple mounted launchers abaft the funnels and two single launchers mounted abeam the bridge. A four boiler, geared steam turbine was suggested, with an estimated required to achieve the requested speed of . The crew was to consist of five officers and one hundred-fifty sailors. Two ships of this specification, designated M89 and M90 were pencilled into the projected 1915 building programme and were expected to be completed by 1917. In the Spring of 1914 the Navy Minister refused to incorporate the ships into the 1915 programme. This came as a surprise to the Navy, as they had already ordered the torpedoes for the expected ships. In the interim, the last 800-tonne destroyer, Enseigne Gabolde, would receive the M89 class' planned propulsion system and torpedoes. Studies on revamping the destroyer design continued until August 1914 and the start of World War I, but all naval construction plans into abeyance. The project would only be revived in Spring 1917. =1918 project= Work on the destroyer design resumed in the Spring of 1917. While the 1914 requirements were officially reiterated, nearly three years of combat experience and advances in technology led to changes in the design. A renewed focus on sea-keeping was placed on the project along with French experience from her Triple Entente allies. The designs of the Regia Marinas and the Royal Navy V class were particularly influential on the evolution of French building plans. Based on wartime experience, rather than merely , combat was now expected at , which was now the maximum range of newly developed torpedoes. The armament was increased to three /25 guns, from the original two. The two single mounted torpedo launchers were eliminated, bringing the total amount of torpedo tubes down to six, but instead of the torpedoes, the ships would now carry newly developed torpedoes. Other wartime technologies also began to leave their mark on the destroyer design. With the new threat of enemy aircraft, staff requirements requested two (eventually, one) high-angle /50 anti-aircraft guns. The French navy also planned to adopt the British practice of a parallel flotilla leader (conducteur d'escadrille) sub-class of destroyer. These ships would be slightly larger to accommodate and additional gun, and the larger staff and additional equipment of a fleet commodore. All these design changes and improvements though came at a cost. To accommodate these changes, the dimensions of the ship would have to be enlarged and the normal displacement increased to 1,650 tons. The machinery was changed to a -shaft geared, it was hoped that the single reduction geared turbine would deliver increased endurance. Power was increased to . These changes in propulsion were estimated to give the destroyers a trial speed of , a full load speed of and an endurance of at . Shortly after the end of the war, on 28 November 1918, the STCN made their final staff requirements. These, in addition to those changes already mentioned, a flared bow with sheer was requested along with a more spacious bridge. The complement was finalized at seven officers and one hundred-sixty nine sailors. By 25 February 1919, the Chief of the French Naval General Staff, vice admiral Ferdinand-Jean-Jacques de Bon (fr) pointed out that between 1914‚Äì1918, the French Navy had built three destroyers. In comparison, the Kingdom of Italy, France's erstwhile ally and potential Mediterranean rival, had built twelve flotilla leaders and forty torpedo boats. On 12 March 1919, de Bon immediately placed priority on destroyer construction, followed by light cruisers, and lastly, capital ships. The proposal was officially accepted by Minister of Marine, Georges Leygues on 4 March 1919. =End of project= Concerns about the main armament lingered with the Naval General Staff though, the Schneider /25 were not designed to operate at the newer, longer ranges expected in destroyer warfare. On 12 March 1919, Vice admiral de Bon approved Note sur les destroyers (Notes on destroyers). These notes was a major departure from previous French naval doctrines, which unusually, used the English term 'destroyers' rather than the French term torpilleur d'escadre. The Notes laid down two separate roles, the traditional torpilleur d'escadre role, which had the primary mission of attacking the enemy line of battle and the secondary mission of disrupting attacks on the French battle line by enemy torpedo boats. The second role called for a larger, more heavily armed ship. This became the contre- torpilleur (literally 'Counter torpedo boat'), a ship whose primary role was scouting, and a secondary role of protecting the battle line against other destroyers. A distant tertiary objective, was attacking the enemy battle line with torpedoes and gunfire. These two ship roles eventually led to the development of the torpilleur and the contre-torpilleur (cancelled in 1920), which led to the .

Distribution  T. anomala is found in the Indo- West Pacific region. It is the most common decapod crustacean in the Sundarbans in India and Bangladesh, though it is often overlooked in traditional sampling efforts.  Ecology and behavior  Its habitat includes littoral and supralittoral zones such as those in mangroves and estuaries.

In the monsoon season, its muddy nest becomes saturated with water and submerges, and the lobster is exposed, allowing it to be easily caught. T. anomala is considered of high importance ecologically, as its nightly burrowing pushes deep soil to the surface, while also helping the import of aerated tidal water up to 2.5 meters deep. The mud mounds provide habitat for other animals including Odontomachus malignus (an ant), termites, Episesarma singaporense (tree- climbing crab), Wolffogebia phuketensis (mangrove mud shrimp), Acrochordus granulatus (file snake), and plants such as the tree Excoecaria agallochoa and ferns.

It was first described in 1895 by Clinton Hart Merriam. It was considered to be a subspecies of Merriam's pocket gopher (Cratogeomys merriami) in the late 20th and early 21st century but has been reinstated as its own species. The IUCN Red List has evaluated it to be of least concern. Description C. fulvescens is mid-sized for the genus Cratogeomys and exhibits sexual dimorphism in size. Adult males weigh of and adult females weigh . Its fur coloration is \\"grizzled yellowish-brown\\" with \\"a strong mixture of black-tipped hairs\\"; the underside is paler than the dorsal fur. The cranial width of its skull is typically less than , making it small for the genus. The dental formula is . Each upper incisor has a longitudinal groove along its anterior surface. The total body length is . Distribution This species is endemic to a small region in the southern half of Mexico. Its range is in the Oriental Basin of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, and is within the Mexican states of Puebla, Tlaxcala, and Veracruz. The elevation in its distribution spans . Merriam noted the type locality as: \\"Chalchicomula, State of Puebla, Mexico\\"; this city is now known as Ciudad Serd√°n. The type locality for the formerly-recognized subspecies C. f. subluteus is Perote, Veracruz. Taxonomic history The American zoologist Clinton Hart Merriam wrote the species description for C. fulvescens in 1895. Merriam based his description on eleven specimens from Puebla and Veracruz, Mexico. In Merriam's classification of Cratogeomys, C. fulvescens was grouped with C. castanops on the basis of cranial morphology. In 1968, Robert J. Russell reclassified Cratogeomys to be a subgenus of Pappogeomys. Russell also analyzed Merriam's C. fulvescens as being a subspecies of what was in his work called Pappogeomys Cratogeomys merriami. Russell stated that of the seven subspecies he recognized for P. (C.) merriami, \\"the most divergent\\" was P. (C.) m. fulvescens due to differences in coloration, size, and cranial morphology. This classification in E. Raymond Hall's 1981 The Mammals of North America also used the combination P. (C.) m. fulvescens for this taxon. Cratogeomys was reinstated as a genus in 1982; the third edition of Mammal Species of the World refers to this taxon as C. m. fulvescens. C. fulvescens was reinstated as its own species in 2005 due to a genetic and morphological study by Mark S. Hafner and colleagues. They placed it in the C. castanops species group. No subspecies are presently recognized. A subspecies, C. f. subluteus had been described in 1934 by Edward William Nelson and Edward Alphonso Goldman. This subspecies was also known by the common names \\"yellow pocket gopher\\" and \\"fulvous pocket gopher\\". The holotypes for C. fulvescens and for C. f. subluteus are both in the collections of the U.S. National Museum of Natural History, Washington, DC. Each specimen consists of its preserved skin and its skull. Nelson and Goldman collected both holotypes: The C. fulvescens holotype was collected in 1894, and the C. f. subluteus holotype was collected in 1893. The specific epithet (, \\"yellowing\\") is the Latin present participle of the inchoative form of the verb meaning \\"to become tawny\\". The epithet of its formerly recognized subspecies, (), is a Latin adjective meaning \\"yellowish\\". The common name for the species, Oriental Basin pocket gopher, refers to the Oriental Basin in Mexico, where it is found. Its common name in Spanish is . Biology G. fulvescens paratypes in the Natural History Museum, London C. fulvescens's diet consists of rhizomes, bulbs, and roots. Pregnancy has been observed from December through February. Because pregnancy was not observed in July, it is thought they only have one litter each year. Two species of chewing lice in the genus Geomydoecus have C. fulvescens as a host: G. fulvescens and G. veracruzensis. Both species were described in 1971 by Roger D. Price and K. C. Emerson. The flea species Dasypsyllus megasoma and Meringis altipecten were also observed on C. fulvescens; although it is thought the presence of M. altipecten is thought to have been accidental rather than due to being a typical ectoparasite for the species. The nematode species Vexillata convoluta is also a parasite of C. fulvescens. Genetics Its diploid number is 2n=40 and its fundamental number is FN=72. C. fulvescens contains an autapomorphic allele for the gene RAG1 distinguishing it from C. perotensis and C. merriami. Conservation status and relationship with humans The IUCN Red List has classified this species as a least-concern species, and SEMARNAT did not include it in its 2010 list of threatened or endangered mammals of Mexico. Although its observed habitat is less than , it is believed to be \\"common and adaptable\\". Part of its range is affected by habitat loss due to human expansion. C. fulvescens were found as roadkill along a highway going through its range. Mark S. Hafner wrote there ought to be further studies on its conservation status, particularly as its geographic range is smaller than that of other Mexican pocket gophers. C. fulvescens have been observed in farmland and might be considered to be a pest as they destroy crops including wheat, corn, and beans.

The work was commissioned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for their renowned low brass section and co- commissioned by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and the Philadelphia Orchestra. It was composed in 2017 and was first performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Riccardo Muti on February 1, 2018. Composition The Low Brass Concerto is cast in one continuous movement in alternating slow and fast sections. It has a performance duration of approximately 17 minutes.Higdon: Low Brass Concerto. Chicago Symphony Orchestra. February 6, 2018. =Instrumentation= The low brass soloists consist of two tenor trombones, bass trombone, and tuba. They are accompanied by a large orchestra consisting of two flutes, two oboes, clarinet, bass clarinet, bassoon, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, timpani, percussion, and strings. Reception Reviewing the world premiere, John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune wrote, \\"The new work harnesses the signature strength of [the CSO's low brass section] in imaginative ways that allow them to function as a unit, duo, trio and individual voices, before her 17-minute, single-movement concerto charges to a rousing close.\\" He added, \\"This is a big-shouldered Chicago brass blowout if there ever was one ‚Äî beautiful, accessible, inventive, impeccably crafted ‚Äî drawing not so much on its muscular might as on its ability, less often recognized, to play softly and lyrically.\\" Hedy Weiss of the Chicago Sun-Times similarly described the concerto as a \\"wonderfully accessible, richly melodic new work ‚Äî one propelled by exhilarating rhythms, vibrant orchestral color, and an ingenious use of strings, woodwinds and percussion.\\" Despite lauding the concerto, Lawrence A. Johnson of the Chicago Classical Review was more critical of the piece, noting, \\"It's probably a good thing that the concerto feels too short rather than too long. If there is a complaint, it's that one wishes there were more standout solo opportunities for each of the four players.\\" He added, \\"Granted, in a work this short there's not a whole lot of space for four players to chart their own varied paths. (The premiere performance ran 20 minutes, slightly longer than the 15 to 17 minutes indicated in the score.) Perhaps some revision and judicious expansion to Higdon's likable concerto might allow each of the four soloists to stand out a bit more and differentiate their instruments more than is currently the case.\\" This criticism was shared by David Patrick Stearns of The Philadelphia Inquirer, who remarked, \\"So the concerto isn't exactly written for four players, but for four players acting more or less as a single entity. Mostly. Individual instruments occasionally pop out in solos or duets. Thus, the foursome has many of the lyrical and dramatic possibilities of any concerto soloist, though not the agility that one associates with, say, a violinist who leaps into the ozone during the cadenza.\\" See also *List of compositions by Jennifer Higdon References Concertos by Jennifer Higdon 2017 compositions Concertos for multiple instruments Music commissioned by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra Music commissioned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Music commissioned by the Philadelphia Orchestra ","title":"Low Brass Concerto"},{"id":"56509319","text":"Abiathar or Eviatar or Evyatar ( ‚ÄôE·∏áyƒÅ·πØƒÅr, \\"the father is great\\") is the name of a person described in the Hebrew Bible.

Moveable Type assembles a database consisting of articles from the first newspaper in 1851 to the present day, specialty collections of Times' content including the crossword puzzles and the recipes, and Web commentaries from Times' readers. The piece then creates choreographed displays of data, divided into scenes, each scene devoted to some aspect of the day's news. =Shakespeare Machine= Ben Rubin, Mark Hansen, Jer Thorp, Michele Gorman.Shakespeare Machine Hansen collaborated with Ben Rubin, Jer Thorp and Michele Gorman for the Shakespeare Machine project in 2012. Over the bar in the center of the lobby of the Public Theater in New York City, the team constructed a chandelier, a digital display consisting of 37 LED panels, one for each of Shakespeare's plays. The piece finds and displays phrases from Shakespeare‚Äôs work that share common rhetorical structures. =Shuffle and A Sort of Joy= Hansen and Rubin collaborated with the Elevator Repair Service and Rebecca Mead to create the theatrical performance Shuffle drawing from the texts of The Great Gatsby, The Sun Also Rises, and The Sound and the Fury, each used previously as a script for an ERS production. Shuffle debuted at the New York Public Library. As the Office for Creative Research, Thorp, Hansen and Rubin produced a second piece with the Elevator Repair Service through the Museum of Modern Art's Artist's Experiments Program. Using MoMA's collections database, A Sort of Joy (Thousands of Exhausted Things) was performed in the museum's second floor galleries. ERS actors received randomized scripts drawn from the titles, artist names, materials and dimensions of the artworks in MoMA's collection. =Timescape= Hansen collaborated with Ben Rubin, Jer Thorp, and Local Projects to create Timescape, an installation in the 9/11 memorial museum. The installation pulls articles from over 100 news sources to create an ever-evolving timeline of the social, cultural, political and economic impacts of the 9/11 attacks that are still felt today. =The Brain Index= The Brain Index is a collaboration between Hansen and Laura Kurgan of the Center for Spatial Research at Columbia University. It allows users to interact with data about the human brain, distributed across many large scale displays. Journalistic work Hansen's art work and journalistic work often intersect. In 2010, Hansen collaborated with Jer Thorp and Jake Porway to create Project Cascade, a tool to visualize connections between articles shared on Twitter. The project grew out of Hansen's work with the New York Times R&D; labs. Hansen's Computational Journalism course at Columbia Journalism School contributed reporting on the 2018 New York Times piece, The Follower Factory, which exposed the wave of fake Twitter followers being bought and sold online. That article was ultimately cited by Twitter as the reason for its July, 2018 \\"purge\\" of tens of millions of suspicious accounts.

He has collected and documented Nardozzi's poetry since 2006. Yasko sometimes uses the tools of graphic design in art installations. This work has been shown at Mattress Factory (The day was today., 2008 and For everything I‚Äôve done and for everything I‚Äôll do., 2009), 709 gallery (This one works best with two people., 2012), Three Rivers Arts Festival (Market Square, 2007) and the Cultural District (For Nate & Jakob, 2015). In 2015, Yasko invited 252 Pittsburgh artists to each make a portrait of the same person: his friend John Riegert. Yasko documented the year-and-a-half process in photographs while Eric Lidji did the same in writing. An exhibition, John Riegert, opened at SPACE gallery in 2016 and a 700-page book of the same name was published in 2017. Also in 2017, Julie Sokolow produced a documentary on the project entitled The John Show. Yasko is married to Sarah Sirlin. They live in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh with their two sons.

Khan is a co- founder of Black Lives Matter Toronto as well as an international ambassador for the Black Lives Matter Network. Khan identifies as black, queer, and gender-nonconforming. Much of their work analyzes intersectional topics including the Black Lives Matter movement, queer theory, Black feminism, and organized protest strategies. Personal life and education Khan was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. They received a Bachelor of Arts from York University, graduating with an honours degree in English language and literature. Khan currently resides in Los Angeles serving as program director for Color Of Change and as a speaker with Keppler Speakers Bureau.https://www.kepplerspeakers.com/speakers/janaya-khan They are married to Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors. Besides activism, Khan is an author and amateur competitive boxer. Activism Khan believes that the sole responsibility of the police is to manufacture criminals and that the police do not keep people safe. They would rather have \\"rapid response justice teams\\" in the place of police. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjIEZf8Skx4 In a 2016 interview with Maclean's magazine, they recalled the difficulty of growing up with an intersectional identity in a society with limited resources and knowledge on intersectionality and transfeminism. Khan states that actions like carding (a Canadian police policy where people are stopped and questioned not in relation to a specific offence) made them realize how normalized their community had been to a heavy police presence accompanied by biased questioning. Incidences like this initiated their path into activism and the ultimate inception of Black Lives Matter Toronto. In October 2014, Khan and fellow Black Lives Matter Toronto co-founder Sandy Hudson organized an action of solidarity following the killing of 33-year-old Jermaine Carby, who was shot and killed during a routine traffic stop in Brampton, Ontario on September 24, 2014. This incident occurred a month after the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown in the United States. After announcing the protest, around 4,000 people gathered to demonstrate in solidarity outside the US Consulate. Wanting to build off this momentum, they decided to meet with Los Angeles- based Patrisse Cullors, one of the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States. This meeting launched the foundations for the Black Lives Matter to become an international movement rather than one based only in the United States. Khan has led a number of demonstrations and events in Toronto, mainly based on instances of police brutality in the United States and Canada. In July 2016, they helped organize a sit-in during Pride Toronto, where protesters came prepared with a list of demands including more representation of minority groups and no uniformed police presence during Pride. Lectures Khan has presented across Canada at a number of institutions, including the University of Toronto and York University. They have also given talks at many campuses in the United States, including Bryn Mawr College and Emerson College. In 2016, they were joined by Black Lives Matter co-founder Opal Tometi to speak at Smith College's \\"When and Where I Enter\\" symposium. Recognition and awards Khan is the recipient of multiple awards, including the 2015 Bromley Armstrong Human Rights Award from the Toronto & York Region Labour Council,http://www.labourcouncil.ca/equity.html and was named one of \\"Toronto's Most Influential\\" by Toronto Life in 2016.

History  The monastery was founded by the holy princess Euphrosyne of Polotsk in 1125, when she settled near the Transfiguration church in Selce. Over time, the sisters of St. Euphrosyne were tonsured: the native Evdokia (in the world of Gordislav) and the cousin Evpraksia (in the world of Zvenislav) - the only daughter of the Polotsk prince Boris Vseslavich. In 1161, with the zeal of St. Euphrosyne the Monk the stone Transfiguration Church was erected, the best preserved monument of the ancient Polotsk architecture. Mother Euphrosynia in 1161 donated a gilt cross to the church. This cross known as the Cross of Euphrosyne of Polotsk had relics of many saints and was carved in wood which is claimed to come from the Life-giving Cross of Christ. The cross was carved by the local master jeweler Lazar Bogsha. In the XIII century the cross was taken from Polotsk, but again returned to the monastery Ivan the Terrible in 1563 after the successful siege of the city. In 1580, the monastery was given to the Jesuits after the capture of Polotsk by Stephen Bathory. In 1654, it was returned to Orthodoxy but in 1667, was again taken over by the Jesuits, who kept it until 1820, when they were expelled from Polotsk. In 1832 the monastery was transferred to the orthodox church and in 1840 it was restored. In 1841 the Cross of the Euphrosyne of Polotsk was returned to the Transfiguration Cathedral. In the 1840s, the ancient monastery was ranked first-class. In the walls of the monastery the Saint Euhrosyne women's spiritual school was located . In 1847, with the Abbess of Claudia Schepanovsky, the construction of the Euphrosyne Refectory Church was started. It was opened on 5 June (23 May o.s.), 1858. In 1897, under the abbess Yevgeniya Govorovich, a monumental five-domed Cross Exaltation Cathedral was erected, designed according to the design of architect V.F. Korshikov in the neo-Byzantine style . In 1921 the monastery was closed, the cross requisitioned, in 1928 was transported to Minsk, in 1929 to Mogilev. In 1941, during the Great Patriotic War, the Cross of Euphrosyne of Polotsk disappeared without a trace and has not yet been found. ¬¥ Abbesses of the Monastery  # Abbess Euphrosyne, Princess of Polotsk (‚Ä† 23 May / 5 June 1173) # Abbess Yevdokiya (the sister of Euphrosyne), Princess of Polotsk (‚Ä† c1180)) # Abbess Paraskeva (Paraskevia), Princess of Polotsk (‚Ä† 1239) # Abbess Ulyaniya (Ulyana) (mentioned in 1552 and 1580) # Abbess Akilina (Oculina) (‚Ä† 10 / December 23, 1577) # Abbess Natalia (‚Ä† late 16th century) # Abbess Innokentiya (Kuleshov) (1841) # Abbess Yevfrosyniya (Dekhtyaryova) (1842-1843) # Abbess Claudia (Schepanovsky) (1843-1854) # Abbess Yevfrosyniya (Serbinovich) (1854-1878) # Abbess Yevgeniya (Govorovich) (1878-1900) # Abbess Olympiada (1900-1903) # Abbess Yevfrosiniya (Sladkevich) (1904-1905) # Abbess Ilariona (Chyornykh) (1905-1910) # Mather Angelina (Petrochenko) (1911-1913) # Abbess Elena (Volkova) (1913-1928) (?) # Abbess Ananias (Trofimova (?) # Abbess of Eleutheria (Novikov) (194 (?) - 1959) # Abbess Yevfrosiniya (Maksimchuk) (1991-1995) # Mother Natalia (Skinner) (1995-1997) # Abbess Anfisa (Sheverdyaeva) (1997-2004) # Abbess Yevdokiya (Levshuk) (2004‚Äìpresent)  Notes  From Russian and Belarus Wikipedia Eastern Orthodox monasteries in Belarus ","title":"Saint Eufrosyne Monastery"},{"id":"56509649","text":"In category theory and related fields of mathematics, a refinement is a construction that generalizes the operations of \\"interior enrichment\\", like bornologification or saturation of a locally convex space.

Helen Razer of the Daily Review also gave the TV series a negative review, disparaging it as \\"a poor attempt at promoting favourable propaganda about Australia‚ÄìUnited States relations\\". Razer also criticized what she regarded as the tokenistic use of Aboriginal characters. Pat LaMarco of The Daily Free Press described the series as a \\"dull and sluggish attempt at a thriller\\". He also viewed the show's release on Netflix as a sign of what he regarded as the deteriorating quality of the streaming company's content. By contrast, Genevieve Burgess of Pajiba gave Pine Gap a favourable review, describing it as a \\"spy thriller for people who don't like spy thrillers.\\" She praised the series for its realistic low-stakes political thriller plot and for defying conventional Hollywood spying tropes by exploring the everyday challenges of its main cast members.

Biography = Early life and comics career = Sal Trapani was born in Brooklyn, New York City in 1927. He attended the School of Visual Arts and counted school co-founder Burne Hogarth among his early influences. His earliest recorded comic book credits include short filler pieces in Airboy Comics in 1949. at the Grand Comics Database. Through the following decades, Trapani racked up credits on hundreds of comic book stories for Gillmor, Charlton, Dell, Gold Key, ACG and others. His most notable credit is as co- creator of the character Nukla. Trapani replaced character co-creator Ramona Fradon for an extended run on the superhero title Metamorpho at DC Comics, beginning in 1966. Trapani also provided inks for many Steve Ditko-illustrated stories published by Charlton, ACG, and Dell, and regularly used Ditko as one of his many ghost artists. Trapani was also a prolific inker for Marvel Comics in the 1970s, providing embellishments for The Incredible Hulk, The Defenders, Ghost Rider, Man-Thing, and many others. Trapani provided the inks on the Man- Thing story that first introduced Howard the Duck, in Adventure into Fear #19, written by Steve Gerber and pencilled by Val Mayerik. =Animation= Trapani also worked as a designer and storyboard artist for animated cartoons. In the 1960s he was employed by Cambria Productions in Los Angeles. From 1962 to 1964 he is credited as art director on 29 episodes of Cambria's Space Angel TV show. The famously low-budget animation process patented by Cambria was basically an animated comic strip with film of actors‚Äô mouths speaking their lines superimposed over the still images. The images were largely created by cartoonist Alex Toth and inked by Trapani. = Involvement in Old Time Radio Fandom = Trapani was a lifelong enthusiast of the Golden Age of Radio and as a fan and collector of radio dramas he was instrumental in kickstarting the organized fandom for so-called Old Time Radio. He helped to organize one of the first OTR conventions and gifting 100 radio shows to convention organizer Jay Hickerson: \\"In 1970, at one of the parties, a guest told me of a friend, Sal Trapani, who had recordings of those radio shows, which intrigued me. I contacted Sal, and we subsequently met. After that initial meeting, Sal gave me 100 shows on 4-1/4 track reels. Thus, my collection of old-time radio shows began.\\" According to brother-in-law Dick Giordano, Trapani also created a radio studio in his garage and produced programs with friends.The Thunder Agents Companion, Jon B.

Composition and materials = Pigments = The pigments that were primarily used in the frescoes at Pompeii were mostly naturally occurring earth pigments such as: * Red and yellow ochres * Green earth * Calcium carbonate (chalk) * Black produced from soot or charcoal * Egyptian blue (artificial pigment consisting of ground blue glass frit) * Bright red cinnabar (toxic mercuric sulfide) = Application = Pompeian frescoes were executed in the buon fresco (true fresco) technique, in which the pigments were painted onto a freshly applied, damp/wet plaster ground. The plaster contains liquid lime (calcium hydroxide). In the process of drying, the liquid lime in the plaster combines with the paints and turns into carbonate of lime, which is chemically equivalent to limestone or marble. Upon drying and setting, the pigments permanently fuse to the plaster to form a solid, durable painting.  Examination and analysis of frescoes  After the Irpinia earthquake in 1980 caused further weakening of Pompeii's crumbling walls, systematic initiatives were put into place to evaluate the damage. The excavation team took documentary photographs, conducted a systematic survey, and recorded the qualitative data through a computer processing system. From these findings, Mariette de Vos calculated that the number of existing paintings made up only ten percent of what was originally found in earlier excavations, while another ten percent was only known through drawings and photos. For the first time, the team was able to show that Pompeii had indeed been over-excavated, and provide a comprehensive view of how, where, and to what extent conservation and restoration was needed. With innovative advances in technology, conservationists and archaeologists have now been able to reconstruct navigable 3-D models of the ancient Pompeian buildings and the rooms that held the frescoes. Through virtual models, and the introduction of digital architectural line drawings, missing parts of the frescoes have been virtually filled in. The use of archival photographs of the frescoes from past excavations and reconstructions have also aided in the digital reconstruction of the paintings, and have allowed for their digital preservation for the future.Watts-Plumpkin, E.

PIA Journal, 22, 115-136. https://dx.doi.org/10.5334/pia.406  Agents of deterioration = Physical = During the beginning of the excavation of Pompeii, inexperienced and untrained excavators cut out pieces of fresco they found without the use of linen and other facing materials to protect the plaster, resulting in many frescoes being broken into multiple fragments. Wall painting scenes that were considered worthy of detachment were brought to the Palazzo degli Studi in Naples, today known as the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, after 1827. Roman fresco Villa dei Misteri Pompeii The frescoes have been affected by rain and groundwater, which have caused water damage and rising damp, resulting in deteriorating and collapsing walls.Ministero dei Beni e delle Attivita Culturali e del Turismo.

Retrieved from https://whc.unesco.org/en/documents/155410 Frescoes are part of an open physical system in which they are in contact with contiguous structures‚Äîsuch as walls, roofs, and the ground‚Äîthat are dynamically involved in a series of chemical and physical events, such as the capillary movement and rise of moisture.Matteini, M. (1987). In review: An assessment of florentine methods of wall painting conservation based on the use of mineral treatments. In S. Cather (Ed.), The Conservation Of Wall Paintings (137-149). Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/wall_paintings.pdf) Catastrophic physical forces such as earthquakes‚Äîwhich have been causing structural damage to the buildings and cracks in the walls since A.D. 62 ‚Äîand the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, have contributed to the deterioration of the frescoes. The frescoes of Pompeii were both damaged by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius from heat and falling debris, which scratched and loosened the plaster and paint, and simultaneously preserved by the volcanic ash until their discovery. In addition, the frost of 1816 entirely destroyed murals in the Amphitheatre in the Villa of Cicero at the Praedia of Julia Felix. Restoration efforts in the late eighteenth century resulted in poorly supported walls and masonry that have proven insufficient for the protection of the wall paintings and have contributed to their rapid degradation. Plaster was fixed with heavy metal clamps, which have gradually come away and left holes and other damage, and the edges of the paintings were smeared with ordinary mortar that has yet to be replaced. Mass tourism that has taken place at Pompeii is another contributing factor to the deterioration of the frescoes. Wear and breakage have occurred due to people leaning on and touching the frescoes, as well as abrasions from bags and other objects rubbing against the frescoes in crowded areas. Vandals have also defaced the frescoes with graffiti. In addition, the frescoes at Pompeii have deteriorated due to poor management, decreased internal maintenance, and a lack of sustainable methods for restoration and conservation.Wollner, J.L. (2013). Planning preservation in pompeii: Revising wall painting conservation method and management. Studies in Mediterranean Antiquity and Classics, 3:1. Retrieved from http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&context;=classicsjournal = Chemical = The constituent materials of wall paintings have a high and open porosity. Because of this, they are easily accessible to liquids and gases including: salt solutions, atmospheric pollutants, water vapor, solutions of materials used for conservation, etc. Build-up from pollutants and contaminants such as waxes and gasoline‚Äîwhich were used in previous restoration attempts as cleaning agents‚Äîvarnishes, and dust have caused the pigments in the frescoes to darken and discolor, and the figures to blur over time. Many of the frescoes were covered with varnish to protect them at their creation, in which the fragments were first washed with water and then covered with gum arabic thinned with aqua regia. However, this practice was later stopped once it was discovered that it bleached and damaged the pigments, though most of the fragments at the Museo Archeologico Nazionale are still covered in the gluey film. Experiments with hot wax were conducted by the ancient Pompeian painters. Painters either prepared the surfaces with melted wax or painted with pigments combined with wax that would then be burned into the plaster, which made them sturdy and durable. This same technique was tried in order to restore the frescoes in the late eighteenth century. While at first this made the paintings more lustrous and clear, years of heat and humidity and the restriction of normal evaporation for the paintings in situ turned the wax white and deteriorated the painted surfaces. In the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, though they didn't suffer from the same climatological effects, they still became white/crusty. The pigments used in the frescoes are of a very fragile nature and have faded as a result of exposure to UV rays, oxygen, and the environment/elements‚Äîespecially those left in situ. Disintegration of plaster, and lifting and detachment of the paint has also been caused by the crystallization of soluble salts, such as sodium nitrate, in the surface layers of the frescoes as a result of fluctuating temperatures and humidity, and exposure to atmospheric pollutants. = Biological = Invasive vegetation such as roots, moss, weeds, and grass have sprouted from the cracks in the eroded floors and walls of the rooms where the frescoes are located.  Preventive conservation  Conservators and leadership are working to better understand the current situation of the Pompeian frescoes in order to avoid further damage and deterioration. The Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di Napoli e Pompei is working on a major reorganization and implementation of new policies and maintenance plans for the entire site of Pompeii. Attention has been given to non-intrusive and reversible reinforcement of the walls, structures and roofs of the buildings that house the frescoes. Recommendations have been made for the reconstruction of the building infrastructures using safe and sturdy materials, and light, modern supports, unlike the previous heavy materials placed in the walls, which caused significant damage. Recommendations have also been made for roof reinforcement structures and other conservation interventions that block ventilation and rain infiltration, and allow for humidity regulation to prevent the plaster of the frescoes from peeling off the walls. Plans for engineering new drainage and sewer systems are also being made. Excavations of Pompeii have been significantly reduced, and barricades, fences, and locked doors have been placed to keep visitors out of vulnerable areas and buildings. Select insulae are also being considered for re-burial in order to protect them from further vegetal growth, weather conditions, earthquake damage, and volcanic eruptions. As an open, reactive system, frescoes require more surveillance after conservation The use of high-tech monitoring tools is also being put into place. An agreement was made with Italian technology and defense company, Finmeccanica, for their donation of services concerning: protection of the artistic heritage from deterioration, pollution, hydrogeological and seismic risks; efficiency, sustainability and safety of the spaces dedicated to culture; and accessibility and fruition of the artistic heritage. The project includes an interferometric monitoring service that provides data on the shifts/movements of the grounds and buildings in Pompeii, and comes equipped with radar sensors that shoot daytime and nighttime pictures. Finmeccanica has also provided a ground-based remote sensing service that employs hyper-spectral imaging devices for the acquisition of images and the spectral signatures of the various materials and chemical components present in areas identified as critical.  Current conservation treatment techniques and methods  Efforts are being made to stabilize the frescoes' chemical and biological degradation and perform long- lasting restoration. In a holistic approach to conservation, the causes of decay are being addressed while increasing the site's ability to prevent or slow future decay. Routine cleaning of all previously restored works and constant upkeep practices are being put into place. Conservators and restorers are meticulously stripping away layers of paraffin, dirt, and varnish with cotton swabs that restorers applied between the 1930s and 1970s to prevent the paints from cracking and flaking. Laser tools are being used to melt away wax and gasoline buildup while leaving the paint untouched. Other conservation treatments include the consolidation of brittle plaster and paint layers, the removal of inadequate inpainting of losses, and improving old fills that were used with cement.  The Great Pompeii Project (Grande Progetto Pompei)  The Great Pompeii Project (GPP) is a ‚Ç¨105 million project funded by the EU and Italian Government that began in 2012.

Their Head Office was based at 225-31 Queen Street, Melbourne. The company's products were divided into divisions, but they were further divided into state-level branches/subsidiaries and foreign limited companies.  History  In December 1981, the Canberra Times reported that the company's profits only had a 1 per cent rise. This small amount was attributed to high interest rates, decreasing building industry activity and industrial unrest. = Factories = In 1958, a new factory was erected in Brisbane, beginning production in March, and the company established subsidiary Sidney Cooke (Qld.) Pty. Ltd., to focus on activities in that state.  Divisions = Printers' supplies division = This division offered printing machinery. = Printing inks, metal coatings, and adhesives division = This division produced inks, resins, varnishes and adhesives. The company's oil-inks factory buildings in Melbourne and Sydney were sold in approximately 1961, and replaced by larger factories in Brooklyn, Melbourne and Mascot, New South Wales respectively. In November 1962, there was a fire at the Brooklyn flexographic and gravure factory, and it was later rebuilt and expanded. In 1966, they established a warehouse in Perth for the storage and display of printing machinery. In approximately 1966, the organisation established three new plants: the Resin Complex (which worked in conjunction with the American-based Interchemical Corporation), the Angier Adhesives Plant (producing rubber-solvent adhesives) and the Tyton Adhesives Factory (based at Mascot, New South Wales). In October 1971, the company set up a factory in Jakarta, Indonesia. In July 1976, Sidney Cooke Ltd. announced its intention to acquire Gollin and Co. Ltd's graphics division. In April 1978, as part of a proposal for a Joint Committee on unemployment in Australia, politician Mick Young highlighted Sidney Cooke Ltd as one of the firms within industry in the preceding five [sic] years to have been \\"...attracted solely to Indonesia.\\" He stated that one of the reasons was Indonesia offering investment opportunities. In 1988-89, Sidney Cooke's printing supplies business was purchased by SICPA (Switzerland).  Chemicals subsidiary  In November 1982, the Australian Government approved a merger between Australian Chemical Holdings Ltd. (engineering) and Sidney Cooke Ltd. The merger was considered in scope of foreign investment policy as the American-based Hercules Inc. had a controlling interest in Australian Chemical Holdings. The governmental press release from then-treasurer John Howard, noted Sidney Cooke's association with Adelaide Steamship Company Ltd. (also known as Adsteam). In March 1984, Sidney Cooke Ltd. was described as being a wholly owned subsidiary of Adsteam, and was sold by the company prior to March 1989. However, in an October 1989 issue of the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, the Adelaide Steamship Company Limited's subsidiaries were listed as including Sidney Cooke Ltd, Sidney Cooke Investments Pty Ltd, Sidney Cooke Chemicals Pty Ltd (of Queen Street, Melbourne); and Sidney Cooke Chemicals, Sidney Cooke Graphics (of New Zealand). In December 1997, notice was given that Sidney Cooke Chemicals Pty Ltd had convened and proposed to be wound up voluntarily, and in January 1999, PricewaterhouseCoopers advised that the company would be liquidated during the following month in Melbourne. = Wire and Metal Products division = This division produced and sold screws, roofing nails, rivets and fasteners. In December 1946, John Dedman replied to Thomas Sheehy's question on notice in the Australian Parliament about the shortage of 1/2 inch blue upholsterers' tacks in South Australia. It was advised that Sidney Cooke Pty. Ltd., as one of the two Australian manufacturers, was lacking plate, pending the arrival of a large shipment. In December 1961, with a view to expanding factory space, the company purchased land alongside their existing factory in Nicholson Street, East Brunswick.  Fasteners division (merged)  On 30 April 1963, they established a new subsidiary company, Sidney Cooke Fasteners Pty. Ltd.. This merged the various state-based wire and metal products subsidiaries into one Australian incorporation, spanning three Victorian factories, two N.S.W. factories and one South Australian factory. That same year, they built a more modern nail factory in East Brunswick. Some of the final liquidations of the subsidiaries were not completed until the financial year ending 30 April 1965, including companies in Victoria (F. Golds Nail Pty. Ltd, John R. Bell & Co. Pty. Ltd.), New South Wales (Sidney Cooke (United Nail) Pty. Ltd, Australian Wire Mills Pty. Ltd.) and South Australia (Sidney Cooke (Wire Products) Pty. Ltd.). Products were created at factories based at Brunswick, Sydney, Adelaide and Suva, Fiji. The Fijian factory began production of nails and fencing materials such as barbed wire in April 1963, and was part of the Sidney Cooke (Fiji) Ltd. subsidiary. On 3 July 1964, they formed a new metal fastenings manufacturing company, Sidney Cooke (N.Z.) Limited, in association with New Zealand's Consolidated Metal Industries Ltd.. This association was created to combat increased tariff restrictions in New Zealand. In 1966, the company received a licence to produce the \\"Stronghold\\" Blind Rivets (Independent Nail Corporation) and \\"Taptite\\" Screws (Continental Screw Company). Another specialised product was the \\"Huck\\" fasteners (or, \\"Huck-bolts\\"). In 1968, they purchased and transferred the stock of the Nail Division of A.E. & F. Tame Pty. Ltd to the Brunswick Factory.  Further reading  (1972). Sidney Cooke Limited 1872-1972. Sidney Cooke Limited [Melbourne].

Prior to becoming consul, Avitus is known to have been governor of the imperial province of Gallia Aquitania, in an unknown year. However, his tenure as governor of Germania Inferior is better known, which he held from 58 to the year 60. Tacitus records his military activities in the year 58. After the Frisii unsuccessfully attempted to migrate into the province and settle on some uninhabited lands, the Ampsivarii, one of the Germanic tribes, likewise attempted to relocate there. Avitus' official response was to command them to submit to Roman rule; unofficially he told their king Boiocalus, an old personal friend, that he was willing to cede to them the lands to live on. However, the Ampsivarii took offense to this response, and called to their old allies to aid them to invade Germania Inferior. Avitus responded to this threat by writing to Titus Curtilius Mancia, governor of Germania Superior, and asking him to campaign on the further side of the Rhine. This demonstration of force cowed the allies Boiocalus had called on, and the Ampsivarii were forced to retreat to the lands of the Usipii and the Tubantes. These tribes did not provide them shelter for long, and the Ampsivarii were forced to seek shelter from other peoples.

Fightcade utilizes networking middleware GGPO to mitigate the effects of network latency on gameplay, and functions as a successor of GGPO's now-defunct matchmaking client. History GGPO, the networking middleware which Fightcade uses for facilitating online play, was created by Tony Cannon in response to the poorly-received netcode of the 2006 Xbox 360 re-release of Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting. GGPO was originally bundled with a client that enabled users to play networked multiplayer games via an embedded emulator. The GGPO client supported a wide variety of popular arcade games, such as Street Fighter II, King of Fighters, and Metal Slug. Pau \\"Pof\\" Oliva, one of Fightcade's major contributors, noted that the GGPO client often suffered from intermittent service, sometimes going offline for several days at a time. Expressing concern over the future of GGPO, Oliva began work on Fightcade during a prolonged GGPO service outage. Oliva originally intended to only use the Fightcade client amongst friends, but positive reception from beta testers encouraged him to publicly release the client. Fightcade launched into beta in late 2014, during a period where other contemporary netplay clients were noted to be largely unsupported by their creators, suffering from either lengthy outages or financial distress. Following the discontinuation of the GGPO client, Fightcade now functions as the GGPO client's de facto successor. A significant portion of Fightcade's functionality was developed through reverse-engineering GGPO's client; Fightcade would go on to inherit many of the GGPO client's features. New features exclusive to Fightcade were also implemented, such as network hole punching, which forgoes the need to port forward when connecting to other users, and replays, which enable users to re- watch their game matches at a later time. In October 2017, Fightcade 2.0 was released through a limited public beta. Features added in 2.0 include an overhauled GUI and an updated version of the bundled emulator, which enables Fightcade to support a broader range of arcade and console hardware. Design Fightcade contains a built-in emulator, \\"FinalBurn Alpha\\", which it uses to run supported games. GGPO is utilized for online multiplayer play, affording Fightcade the same \\"rollback\\" lag mitigation techniques present in GGPO's original client. The software client supports a large variety of arcade hardware, including many Capcom boards (CPS-1, CPS-2, CPS-3) and SNK's Neo Geo. With the beta release of Fightcade 2.0, Fightcade features preliminary support for the Sega Genesis and TurboGrafx-16.

The album was recorded in Denmark and released in 1990 via GNP Crescendo label. Background The album contains recordings performed by the two musicians in the studio of the Danish broadcaster on 29 March 1990. Burton and Bley were in Denmark at the request of the Danish Jazz Center. Each played there with his own ensemble, but for this album they played only as a duo. The binding factor for Burton and Bley is jazz composer Carla Bley. Burton played her pieces relatively often, and Paul Bley was her husband. The album contains solo pieces for vibraphone (tracks 3 11) and piano (tracks 6 7 8); the other recordings are the duets. Reception Scott Yanow of Allmusic stated \\"Although they have utilized the talents of some of the same musicians through the years (most notably Steve Swallow) and both recorded for ECM, vibraphonist Gary Burton and pianist Paul Bley had not recorded before this 1990 Copenhagen session. The combination generally works, with some of Burton's romanticism and melodic approach rubbing off on Bley during the date (the usually somber pianist actually sounds a little lighthearted during \\"Isn't It Romantic\\") while the vibist sometimes emulates Bley's emphasis on space. On their six duets, Burton and Bley do not take turns soloing per se as much as alternate being the lead voice. Their unaccompanied features (three apiece) are generally in the same introspective but exploratory mood, making this a quiet program of thought- provoking if occasionally sleepy music.\\" Track listingPersonnel Band * Paul Bley ‚Äì piano * Gary Burton ‚Äì vibraphone Production * Lars Palsig ‚Äì engineer * Jan Persson ‚Äì photography * Ib Skovgaard ‚Äì producer ReferencesExternal links and sources * 1990 albums Gary Burton albums Paul Bley albums ","title":"Right Time, Right Place"},{"id":"56510349","text":"Isa bek Hajinski House or the House of Hajinski is located near the Maiden's Tower in Sabail, Baku. It survived a period of rapid prosperity, met with the aggressive fury of the Dashnaks and Bolsheviks, endured total nationalisation, and has absorbed the whole turbulent history of the past century.  Architecture  Maiden Tower in left The Hajinski residence reflected the status, position and colossal authority of its owner. The lightness and airiness of its shape, emphasised by the seven spires of different height, the brilliantly designed corner fa√ßade, with its colourful tower and rich architectural d√©cor carried out in the best traditions, and mosaic works in the style of ancient Assyria create a fantastic impression and take you to a fairytale world. The irrepressible fancy of the owner, the refined taste of the architect and the high quality of the construction created an authentic masterpiece of pure Baku architecture which managed to absorb and organically synthesise the influences of very different cultures. The Hajinski residence became separated apartments during the Soviet period. It is comforting that today the fa√ßade of the Hajinski House is decorated with memorial plaques dedicated to its outstanding inhabitants and guests. However, today no original reminders of the owner of the house survive, although in old photos, it is possible to see Arabic and Cyrillic script, which displays the name of Isa Bey Hajinski carved on the stone on two of its facades. These elements of the d√©cor completely disappeared in Soviet era, and have never been restored. Until recently the Hajinski House was in a deplorable state. In the 2007 repair work, some mosaic adornments and elements of the d√©cor were partly reconstructed. Unfortunately, this restoration did not affect a number of the important elements of the fa√ßade, such as the triangular balconies of the second floor of the apartment, where De Gaulle and Mammadaliyev resided. The inscriptions of the name of the owner and the colourful tiles of the central tower were changed into monotonous metallic sheets of a silver colour, which do not at all enhance the fa√ßade. Prior to the 1940s, the building was renamed as \\"Hacinski's House\\". But priorities change, and later, as analogues of the Stalin buildings in Moscow (although these houses are built in a different style, they have common features in terms of luxury), it was called a \\"coastal home.\\" Famous occupants In November 1944 during the Second World War, General De Gaulle stayed in the Hajinski House on the way from Tehran to Moscow and in a later period the same apartment was inhabited by the family of the outstanding scientist and chemist and twice President of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan Yusif Heydar oghlu Mammadaliyev, whose hundredth anniversary was formally celebrated by UNESCO in 2005. It was mostly occupied by middle-class party workers, as well as several petrochemical scientists. The famous corner of the building was empty - it was reserved for special guests. In 1944, one of the special guests was Charles de Gaulle, the temporary head of the French government at that time. At that time, the Soviet Information Bureau wrote: \\"On 14 November, the Chief of the French Government, General de Gaulle arrived in Baku together with the accompanying persons, including the members of the Government of the USSR and General of the Collective Security Treaty Organization and an honorary guard at the airport decorated with the flags of France and the Soviet Union, and the orchestra performed the hymns of France and the USSR, and General de Gaulle watched the Koroglu opera at the Azerbaijan Opera Theater. There is another memorial in the building. There was outstanding scientist and first academician Yusif Mammadaliyev in the field of chemistry. At that time, Mammadaliyev was the one who created the best high-flammable fuel and thus made a great contribution to science. He took his apartment here in the years after the war. The point is that Mammadaliyev, who studied and worked at the Moscow State University before the war, returned to the Azerbaijan Institute of Oil Research after returning to Baku. Here, he has made some of the most significant inventions for the front. An example is the improvement of the quality of Soviet fuel. Thanks to this fuel, the famous T-34 tanks have become the fastest tanks of the Second World War. Soon, Mammadaliyev was provided with a flat from the third floor of the coastal house, as the head of the laboratory. The scientist lived all his life there. In the 50s, Mammadaliyev began his education at the Azerbaijan University named after Kirov, first assistant professor, then professor, chief of the department and finally rector (1954-1958).

He was the eldest son of William Butler Lloyd (1825-1874), a banker, of Monkmoor Hall, Shrewsbury, and Preston Montford, Shropshire, and his wife Jane Amelia, who was fifth daughter of the Reverend George Hunt of Wadenhoe, Northamptonshire, and sister of George Ward Hunt, who became a cabinet minister under Benjamin Disraeli. He was born at Monkmoor Hall in 1854, and was educated at Marlborough College and St John‚Äôs College, Cambridge. He entered his family's banking firm of Burton, Lloyd and Company which in 1886 became absorbed by another Shrewsbury bank, Rocke, Eyton and Company to form Eyton, Burton, Lloyd and Company, also known as the Salop Old Bank, of which Lloyd became Senior Partner. In 1907, it was bought by the Capital and Counties Bank, which made him a director. In turn this was taken over in 1918 by Lloyds Bank Limited, which also made him director. He was also director of the Birmingham branch of the Northern Assurance Company Ltd and deputy chairman of the Sentinel Waggon Works Ltd of Shrewsbury. Butler Lloyd was a magistrate for the county of Shropshire and Borough of Shrewsbury and held posts in a number of other bodies including: Chairman of Shrewsbury Borough Education Committee in 1907, governor of Shrewsbury School, Deputy Treasurer of the Royal Salop Infirmary, Treasurer of the Atcham Poor Law Union, Shropshire and West Midlands Agricultural Society and Secretary of the South Shropshire Hunt. Butler Lloyd served as Mayor of Shrewsbury in 1886-87 and 1888‚Äì89 and was an Alderman of Shrewsbury Borough Council from 1909 to 1920. He was also a member of Shropshire County Council, on which he represented Shrewsbury Welsh Ward from 1912 to 1925. He was elected as Member of Parliament for Shrewsbury, then a borough constituency in a by-election in 1913, following the death of the previous incumbent, Sir Clement Lloyd Hill. He had intended to only stay until the next general election, due no later than the end of 1915, and in February 1914 the parliamentary candidacy of his party had been accepted by (unrelated) George Ambrose Lloyd, at the time Member of Parliament for West Staffordshire. However both the election and the latter's candidature were forestalled by the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. When the first postwar general election of December 1918 was held, George Ambrose Lloyd had been appointed Governor of Bengal while Butler Lloyd stood for election for the new county constituency the Shrewsbury seat had become, as Coalition Coupon candidate. He stood down at the 1922 general election. He married in 1880 Constance Mary, daughter of Colonel Richard Jenkins, late 1st Bengal Cavalry, and had two sons and two daughters who survived him. His home for most of his life was at Shelton Hall, near Shrewsbury. Butler Lloyd died at Shelton Hall on 28 March 1930 aged 76 and was buried on 31 March at Shrewsbury General Cemetery in Longden Road.

It stands north of Trier and the same east of Luxembourg. The hill castle was built in the early 14th century by the Archbishop of Trier, Diether of Nassau as the successor to a fortified manor farm. From then on, it was a fief castle of the Electorate of Trier which was enfeoffed (subleased) to electoral subjects and cathedral deans. During the War of the Palatine Succession, the castle was occupied by French troops and largely blown up in 1689. The great damage was not repaired. However, tall sections of curtain walls, elements of corner towers and almost of all the exterior and the stone staircases of its medieval tower house stand. Three larger-footprint modern buildings including a hotel-restaurant are on the southern part of the east-facing promontory. The hotel's outdoor terrace overlooks the lightly or densely wooded valley, depending on direction views. Fields have likely long stood next to the near-bend of the river enabling a clear view to the impassably sheer hillside (on horseback) on the opposite bank and intervening north-south route.  History  In the early 10th century, Archbishop Radbod of Trier had a fortified house () built on a rock near Kordel on the site of an older predecessor building () and pledged it around 926 to his vassal Vollmar for life. This manor house of an agricultural estate was the predecessor of the present Ramstein Castle and is referred to in the records as Runnesstein or Castrum Ruynstein. The present name of the site did not appear until around 1600. Until the beginning of the 14th century there is no further record of the castle complex, because it was not until this time that Diether of Nassau, Archbishop of Trier began work on a castle here, whose construction lasted from 1300 to 1307. The castle was thus located on the Roman road from Trier to Andernach and not far from the old Roman road from Trier to Cologne. However, the castle had to be finished under Diether's successor, Baldwin of Luxemburg. The exact date of its completion not known, but it can be assumed that the building work was completed in 1317, because Baldwin sealed a deed at the castle that year. By 2 July 1310 he had transferred the still unfinished building to his confidant and teacher, John of Bruch (Johann de Bruaco) as a fiefdom. John was a cathedral dean in Trier, and the feudal treaty provided that, from now on, the respective holder of this office should always be the feofee of Ramstein Castle. However, this provision was not complied with. Walls of the tower house, interior view The construction of the castle did not proceed without controversy. The knight, Arnold of Pittingen, a high Luxembourg nobleman and his representative, Vogt of Butzweiler, objected to the castle. He took his case to the Roman-German King, but Archbishop Baldwin was able to prove that Ramstein had been built on archiepiscopal land. Although records of the outcome of the trial have not survived, it is likely that Arnold lost his case 13 March 1310, as Baldwin continued the expansion of the castle soon afterwards. In 1328, John of Fels (Johann von der Fels) and his wife, Jutta of Reuland, and Jutta's son from their first marriage, William of Manderscheid, each received half of Ramstein Castle as a fief. Baldwin, however, reserved right of access (√ñffnungsrecht). Both the married couple and William pledged their shares several times during period that followed. Baldwin's successor, Boemund II of Saarbr√ºcken, transferred the castle on 1 July 1358 to his Palastmeister and Sch√∂ffenmeister, Johann Wolf, on the condition that he kept it in good order and employed enough guards to secure it. Only a short time later, Archbishop Cuno II of Falkenstein, enfeoffed Ramstein to the Abbess of Trier monastery of St. Irmina, Irmgard of Gymnich. From 1402 onwards, she was followed by the cathedral canon and chorbishop, Rupert of Hoheneck, as vassal. He, too, was required to maintain the castle and had to undertake to live there himself. Some time after Rupert's death in 1417, Bernard of Orley occupied the castle, claiming ownership. As a result, Archbishop James I of Sierck had Ramstein Castle besieged. The dispute was finally settled by an arbitration court, which ruled in favour of the Archbishopric. The castle had suffered from the prolonged conflict and was in a bad condition. However, as the necessary financial resources were lacking, the damage was not repaired for the time being and the buildings gradually deteriorated. It was not until 28 May 1488 when Chorbishop Dietrich of Stein was given the lifetime fee of Ramstein that renovations took place. He had the castle rebuilt in accordance with the stipulations of the feudal agreement. After Dietrich's death in 1500, Henry of Hartenrode succeeded him that year: Archbishop John II of Baden appointed him the lifelong Burggrave of Schloss Rumstein. In the 16th century, Archbishop and Prince-Elector Richard von Greiffenklau zu Vollrads probably lived in the castle himself. He solved the problem of water supply by building a clay pipe from a forest spring to the castle. The so-called \\"Brunnenstein\\", a memorial stone that commemorates this event, is still preserved today and is exhibited in the foyer of the inn situated within the castle grounds. The inscription reads: :RICHART GRIFFENCLAE VONN VOLRACZS ERTZBISCHOFF ZW TRIER VUN CHOERFVUERST HAIT MICH THOEN DRINGEN VSZ DIESSEM FILSCHEN SPRINGEN ANNO XV XXVII [(1527)] The archbishop was succeeded by cathedral dean, Bartholom√§us von der Leyen as owner from 1578 onwards. Afterwards, the estate went as a fiefdom to the cathedral deanery and remained so until it was seized as part of Napoleon's secularization drive at the beginning of the 19th century. However, the deans did not live in Ramstein Castle themselves, but had them managed and administered by a courtier (Hofmann; Lat.: villicus). During the Franco-Dutch War, Ramstein ended up in French hands for a year from 1674 until it was liberated by imperial troops. Afterwards the castle was further fortified. Warlike conflicts during the War of the Palatine Succession finally put an end to Ramstein Castle. On 18 September 1689, it was set on fire by French soldiers and two corners were blown up. Since then it has been a ruin. After the destruction of the tower house, the Hofmann moved into the farmhouse belonging to the castle estate, which had already burned down on 19 April 1675. It was subsequently rebuilt and destroyed by another fire in 1786. The then lord of the castle, cathedral dean, Anselm of Kerpen, planned the rebuilding of a larger house, but since the costs estimated by the architect were too high, it was rebuilt on the old, surviving foundations. After the occupation of the Rhineland by the French under Napoleon the ruin was confiscated and, in the course of the secularisation, auctioned on 21 Frimaire XII, i.e. on 13 December 1803, to Trier lawyer, Wilhelm Josef Fritsch, for 9,000 francs. On 30 November 1826 Fritsch's heirs sold the castle to the Trierbrewer and red tanner (de), Franz Ludwig Bretz (also Britz), whose son Nikolaus opened a restaurant there in the 1870s. His descendants still own the castle and run a fifth-generation hotel-restaurant there. The first restoration work was carried out in 1928. The eastern wall of the castle was strongly reinforced. In summer 1930, safety measures were carried out on the crown of the wall. Towards the end of the Second World War, however, the ruin suffered heavy damage from artillery fire and had to be repaired and made safe in 1987. The castle of Ramstein can be visited by appointment as part of a guided tour (contact the Society for the Preservation of Ramstein Castle - F√∂rderverein Burg Ramstein ).  Description  Ramstein Castle consists of an inner bailey and its associated domestic buildings on an oval area measuring roughly 37 √ó 57 metres. Of the former enceinte (curtain walls and corner towers) few remains survive. The Gothic castle is a tower house with a trapezoidal ground plan measuring 13 √ó 10.8 metres. It is estimated that its outer walls, 1.35 metres metres thick and made of rubble stone, were once 25 metres high and had four storeys. Of the latter, only two and parts of another survive; the maximum height is 18 metres. On the inside of the walls, holes for the former ceiling beams and the remains of seat niches and chimneys can be made out. The embrasures are made of grey and red sandstone quarried locally. Most of the tower windows have Gothic trefoil surrounds. Very well preserved is the 1.55-metre-wide and 2.45-metre-high western entry portal of the tower which is separated from the outer bailey by a 4.70-metre-wide throat ditch. This probably used to be bridged by a wooden drawbridge. At one time entry from the outer bailey was from a stone staircase hewn in the rock, traces of which can still be seen. The storeys of the tower can be reached via a helical staircase in two, round staircase towers made of hewn rock (Haustein) on the northeast corner and the outside of the south wall near the main entrance. On the ground floor is the largest fireplace of the house, which is why it is believed that this was where the kitchen was. There are 3 other fireplaces on the first floor, which was riven in two by a timber-framed wall. Perhaps the private living rooms of the lords of the castle were here. The second floor had a single large hall, which was presumably used for festivals, receptions and meetings. Missing fireplaces on the third floor and so the option of heating, indicate that this was the servants' floor.  References  Backes (1960), 45. Thon and Ulrich (2007), 111. Ost (2006), 10.

Description The 7-foot tall, 800-pound bronze statue was created by sculptor Sean Hedges-Quinn and cast in a foundry in London. It stands on a 4-foot granite plinth and was erected near to the spot Hawkins would have stood when she addressed the public on the topic of women's suffrage. It portrays Hawkins speaking and gesturing with her right arm raised. History=Campaign and funding= The statue is the first statue of a named woman in the county of Leicester. The statue campaign was initiated and led by city Councillor Adam Clarke from 2012. Clarke formed the 'Alice Hawkins Legacy Group' alongside Hawkins' great grandson Peter Barratt. The group had the sole aim of fundraising for the statue. City Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby committed to the council's funding of a plinth and ongoing maintenance. Funding provided by trade unions supported a design competition that led to the commissioning of sculptor Sean Hedges-Quinn. The statue itself was funded (¬£62,400) by local businessman Jamie Lewis' charitable fund. Lewis' student accommodation portfolio includes the sensitively converted factory 'Equity Works', where Alice was employed as a shoe machinist. =Unveiling= The sculpture in 2018 The statue was unveiled on 4 February 2018, in a ceremony attended by thousands of people, including some of Hawkins' descendants. The unveiling was preceded by a march from Humberstone Gate to the city's new market square. The head of the march included Helen Pankhurst, great-granddaughter of suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst. Elaine Pantling, actress and writer of 'Alice in Her Shoes' appeared on the front page of The Guardian and The Scotsman on 5 Feb 2018 leading the march. Images of the unveiling featured in several other national newspapers. The march and unveiling ceremony were covered by BBC, ITV and Sky News and covered live on local radio. Several speakers including Lord Willy Bach (great-nephew of suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst), city mayor Sir Peter Soulsby and Alice's great grandson Peter Barratt addressed the crowds. The DMU Gospel Choir sang 'Rise Up'. The statue was unveiled by Alice's great great grand-daughter Kate Barratt, health campaigner Alice Gibbs, Cllr Manjula Sood MBE and Rt Hon Liz Kendall MP. TV and radio arts and news broadcaster Geeta Pendse hosted the ceremony. The statue was unveiled in the week prior to the centenary of the royal assent of the Representation of the People Act 1918, and was the first of several statues across England to be unveiled during the centenary year.

Mohammed al-Baqir's third son, Ibrahim Isa, was buried in Goy Imamzadeh (in 739), 7th km of the city of Ganja. This monument is similar to the monument \\"Char Minar\\" in Bukhara. A.A.Bakikhanov also noted in his Gulistani-Iram work that this was a sacred place of pilgrimage in Barda. The fact that this place is a sanctuary also confirms that there is no mosque in Imamzadeh. Figured layout of the bricks of Imamzadeh mosque, coordination of stone and brick in construction, and the use of tiles appear to be influenced from Barda Mausoleum (built in 1322). The monument was rebuilt in 1868 by the famous architect Karbalayi Safikhan Karabakhi (1788, Ahar-1910, Shusha). He served in the development of Karabakh architecture. Karbalayi Safikhan Karabakhi linked the architectural elements of the eastern architecture with local traditions, especially in the mosques he built. Restoration of Imamzadeh Mosque in Barda (1868), Aghdam Mosque (1870), Ashagi Mosque in Shusha (1874-75) and Govharaga Mosque Restoration (XIX century), as well as the Tatar Mosque in Odessa (1870), Garabaghli Mosque (1880) in Ashgabat Safikhan are among works of Karabakhi. Believers died in other places but were buried in a cemetery around the Imamzadeh mosque in Barda, according to their testimony. There are several historic monuments around the Imamzadeh Mosque. 20 meters to the north of the mosque, Bahman Mirza Qajar Mausoleum and to the east, ruins of Akhsadan Baba Mausoleum, which was built in XIV century, are located.

The flooding of the tunnels between the Bishan and Braddell MRT stations was caused by heavy rain and a faulty maintenance pump. The flooding of the tunnels made the passage impassable, and bridging bus services had to be deployed while the Singapore Civil Defence Force and maintenance staff removed the water from the tunnel. The incident caused more than S$2 million in damages and lost revenue for the operator SMRT and led to the firing of eight maintenance employees. Background The section of flooded tunnels between Bishan and Braddell was part of the first section of the system to open. At the time of the incident, the system was going through a turbulent period plagued with multiple disruptions and delays which caused much public displeasure, and this incident further aggravated the situation. Earlier in the day, there was a lunchtime delay on the North East line, and in the previous month, service on the Bukit Panjang LRT line was disrupted. Incident At 5.33 p.m. on 7 October 2017, heavy rain flooded the tunnels between the Bishan and Braddell MRT stations. In addition, a small trackside fire, whose cause is still unknown, was spotted by a train driver between the Raffles Place MRT station and the Marina Bay MRT station. This prompted the trains operator, SMRT, to suspend all service from Ang Mo Kio to Marina South Pier. SMRT provided free bridging buses along the affected stretch of stations. At 7.07 p.m., the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) received a call from SMRT about a flooding situation in the tunnels between the two affected stations. SMRT then officially reported the flooding on social media at 7.30 p.m. Train service between the Newton MRT station and Marina South Pier was restored, but service between Newton and Ang Mo Kio remained down. SMRT also mentioned that its engineers were working with SCDF personnel to pump water out of the affected stretch of tunnels. At 1.50 p.m. the next day, SMRT said that the water had been cleared and that service would resume, and test trains were deployed to ensure passenger safety. This resulted in almost 20 hours of disruption. Investigation Following the incident, SMRT and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) launched a joint investigation into the incident. The initial report delivered by the LTA listed three possible causes for the failure. The investigation led to the uncovering of falsified maintenance records and lack of maintenance of the water pumps. Aftermath As a result of the incident, SMRT suffered S$2 million in damage to trackside equipment and trains. The incident prompted a check of other similar pumps around the system, two of which, at Lavender and Kembangan, were also found to be faulty. SMRT also fired eight employees from their maintenance crew ‚Äî including a senior executive, two managers, and five members of the technical staff ‚Äî as a result of the incident.

Issued by the Infrastructure and Projects Authority in December 2017, its aim is to improve productivity in the sector and make savings of ¬£15 billion per year. It proposes to do this by increasing innovations like off-site construction and new digital technology, improving government procurement procedures, and improving integration and collaboration. It is seen as a welcome initiative by the industry, and early implementation of its aims has been incorporated into the water industry's 2019 price review.  Aims  The British construction industry has been in a period of stagnating productivity, and the Transforming Infrastructure Performance (TIP) report is seen as an opportunity to tackle this. Productivity in the rest of the UK economy has been improving at a greater rate than that in construction for some time. Research and development expenditure in that sector is reasonably high, but it has often been spent in an uncoordinated and unfocused way with poor returns. The existing business model of project-by-project transactional delivery has made cost the primary factor in determining the supply chain rather than a consideration of what is best for the project or client. The TIP report was issued by the British government's Infrastructure and Projects Authority (IPA) in December 2017 and outlined three key aims for the ten years following publication: *Ensuring investment is made in the \\"right\\" projects *Improving the construction sector's productivity *Maximising benefits of investment in infrastructure These aims require improvements in the planning, procurement and delivery of projects. The report recognises that significant improvement has been made in long-term strategic planning since the 2015 establishment of the National Infrastructure Commission and the 2016 issue of the National Infrastructure Delivery Plan. This includes switching major infrastructure bodies such as Highways England, Network Rail, HS2 and the Environment Agency from annual budgets to multi-year spending plans. The government intends to save the industry ¬£15 billion per year by implementing TIP. The programme was announced alongside details of new construction projects valued at ¬£600 billion over the next 10 years.  Proposed delivery  The IPA was given responsibility for delivering TIP with oversight by HM Treasury. Delivery would be supported by using the purchasing power of the government, implementing initiatives across all government departments and working closely with industry through the Construction Leadership Council, the Infrastructure Client Group and the Construction Industry Training Board. Priorities for the first two years following the report are: *Establishing benchmarking of current major project cost and performance in the UK, the G20 and the OECD *Expanding use of the cross-sector integration approach pioneered on the Cambridge ‚Äì Milton Keynes ‚Äì Oxford corridor to other regional initiatives, such as the Northern Powerhouse, Midlands Engine and Thames Gateway *Supporting the implementation of the Crown Commercial Service Procuring for Growth Balanced Scorecard *Supporting a move to off-site construction methods as announced in the November 2017 United Kingdom budget *Supporting implementation of the Construction Sector Deal to improve the level of innovation and skills in the industry *Driving the implementation of digital technology in the sector, such as through the Digital Built Britain programme and the Infrastructure Industry Innovation Platform, to build on recent examples of good practice in this field, such as the Highways England Smart Motorways programme *Focusing on the IPA's core role of advising ministers in planning and procurement of major projects, and refreshing the government's construction strategy in 2018 The IPA cautioned that the plan should not be seen as a means of driving down construction costs but rather that better whole life performance needed to be realised. A new benchmarking team will be established at the IPA to monitor the delivery of British infrastructure projects against global benchmarks. The report cites the Institution of Civil Engineers' Project 13 as an example of how change can be driven in the industry. Project 13 seeks to alter the behaviour and processes of organisations to implement better assessment and incentivisation of productivity and to move from project-by-project delivery to more long-term and integrated approaches. One of its key aims is to improve collaboration in the industry. One of the IPA's predecessor organisations, Infrastructure UK, launched a similar Infrastructure Cost Review in 2010, which achieved its aims of saving ¬£3 billion in infrastructure spending by 2015. The TIP initiative has been linked to a rewrite of the government's construction strategy, the current version of which is the Government Construction Strategy: 2016‚Äì2020.  Reception and implementation  There was a good reception for the report in the construction industry, though there was a desire for actual change to be implemented rather than for continual reviews and reports. Early adopters included Ofwat, which implemented direct procurement‚Äîtendering projects for its whole lifecycle, including finance, design, build and operation, rather than just construction‚Äîin its 2019 price review. An earlier scheme to have adopted this was Thames Water's ¬£4.2 billion Thames Tideway Tunnel. Constructing Excellence, the sector-wide industry reform organisation, welcomed the report stating that it was a \\"positive step\\" for UK infrastructure and that improved collaboration would \\"achieve better performance through delivery, whole life asset performance and ultimately outcomes for customers\\". Andrew Jones, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, said that the government would use its role as a client in 25% of all UK construction to implement the plan. He was keen that the industry reaps the benefits of off-site construction, which can reduce waste by 90% and speed up delivery by 60%. He cited examples of schools which could be completed in around 4 months, rather than in 12 months by traditional construction. Deputy Chair of the National Infrastructure Commission Sir John Armitt welcomed the report and the potential for investment to be made on new High Speed 3 and Crossrail 2 railways. However, he stated that the government needed to provide a clearly defined strategy for the coming decades and not just for the short- term. New Civil Engineer, the magazine of the Institution of Civil Engineers, stated that the industry needs to improve how it manages and releases data, particularly that related to productivity and risk assessment. It called for standardisation, transparency and better benchmarking of good performance to allow proper assessment against the TIP targets.

Background The A S·∫ßu Valley was a vital corridor for moving military supplies coming from the Ho Chi Minh Trail and was used by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) as a staging area for numerous attacks in northern I Corps. Three months after the conclusion of Operation Delaware, MG Richard G. Stilwell, the U.S. Army deputy commander of III Marine Amphibious Force decided to mount another operation against the valley to disrupt the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) logistics network and forestall any attacks in I Corps. Operation A Radio repairman from HQs 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry, 101st Airborne Division, tests an AN/PRC 77, 7 August 1968 The assault into the A S·∫ßu Valley was preceded by an artillery bombardment from Firebase Berchtesgaden and Firebase Georgia and B-52 and tactical fighter-bomber strikes while tear gas was dropped at three routes into the valley from Laos. On 4 August 1968 helicopters operating from Firebase Birmingham landed the first elements of the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division in the valley near the abandoned A L∆∞·ªõi Camp. Resistance was light with only one helicopter gunship being forced down by PAVN fire. On 5 August elements of the ARVN 1st Division were landed in the southern part of the valley and on 6 August the elite ARVN Hac Bao (Black Panther) Reconnaissance Company arrived in the valley completing the deployment of forces. The U.S./ARVN forces proceeded to search the valley meeting only scattered resistance until 10/11 August when the ARVN 3rd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment was attacked by elements of the PAVN 816th and 818th Main Force Battalions. Air and artillery support was called in and the PAVN retreated into the jungle losing several dozen killed. Also on 10 August a misplaced air strike hit Company D, 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, killing seven and wounding fifty-four men. On 16 August, two Long-range reconnaissance patrol teams and elements of Company C, 326th Engineer Battalion, laid delayed fuse mines and sensors (connected to Firebase Berchtesgaden) at the western passes into Laos to impede and monitor PAVN movement. On 17 August the U.S./ARVN force began to be lifted out of the valley and this proceeded without PAVN interference, concluding on 20 August. Aftermath U.S. losses were 7 killed, while ARVN losses were 11 killed, 8 of which were from a U.S. artillery round that fell short. US/ARVN forces claims the PAVN losses were 181 killed and 4 captured. Only a modest amount of supplies were located and destroyed, which suggested that the PAVN had still not recovered from the effects of Operation Delaware.

Career Born in Clermont-Ferrand, Puy-de-D√¥me, Pladner won a gold medal at the 1925 European Amateur Boxing Championships, and made his professional debut in January 1926 with a win over Rene Boriello. He won his first 13 fights before being held to a draw in January 1927 by Kid Socks. Awarded the French flyweight title after opponent Francois Moracchini withdrew at the last minute, he defended it successfully against Moracchini in February 1927, and over the course of that year added wins over Michel Montreuil, Alf Barber, Nicolas Petit-Biquet, and two further wins over Moracchini. He suffered the first defeat of his career in December 1927 when he lost a points decision to Johnny Hill at the National Sporting Club in London. Pladner had been due to challenge Victor Ferrand for the latter's European title, but when the champion pulled out, Pladner was awarded the title. Pladner was beaten again by Hill in March 1928 in a fight incorrectly reported in some places as for the European title. He made a successful defence of his French and European titles in May 1928, knocking out Marcel Josie in the twelfth round at the Salle Wagram. Pladner beat French featherweight champion Robert Tassin in October 1928, and Ernie Jarvis in December, and in February 1929 faced Hill again, this time beating the Scotsman via a sixth-round knockout, the only defeat of Hill's career.\\"Johnny Hill, Scotland's first boxing world champion 1928\\", BBC, 16 October 2014. Retrieved 6 February 2018 In March 1929, Pladner challenged for Frankie Genaro's IBU and NBA world titles at the V√©lodrome d'hiver, Paris. Pladner knocked Genaro out with a body shot within the first minute of the first round to become world champion. Pladner and Genaro met again the next month, with Genero regaining the world title after Pladner was disqualified for a low blow. Pladner expressed an intention to move up to bantamweight, but in June 1929 defended his European and French flyweight titles against Eugene Huat. Huat stopped him in the fifteenth and final round to take the titles. Pladner won his first fight at bantamweight, beating Kid Socks on points in October 1929. In December 1929, Pladner beat European bantamweight champion Carlos Flix in a non-title fight. After losing to Huat again in May 1930, he put together a run of eleven fights unbeaten, before losing a points decision in April 1931 to Benny Sharkey. In May 1931, he beat Francois Biron on points to take the French bantamweight title, making a successful defence against Biron in September. In 1932 Pladner travelled to Canada for a series of fights, including a tournament to find a challenger for world champion Panama Al Brown. Pladner won five of these fights, the last a win over Newsboy Brown, with one drawn, and in September 1932 faced the world champion at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto. The fight was a short one, with Brown knocking Pladner out in the first round. His Canadian adventure over, Pladner was beaten again by Brown in Paris in November 1932, and was beaten by Young Perez in Tunis in January 1933. Over the next two years, Pladner lost only two fights (to Perez and Kid Francis), a period that included successful defences of his French bantamweight title against Joseph Decico, Frank Harsen, and Huat. He lost the title in April 1935, Decico taking a points verdict. In July 1935, the IBU recognised Pladner as the European bantamweight champion. In October 1935, Pladner lost his European title to Maurice Dubois, losing on points. He retired in 1936 with a final record of 104 wins, 16 losses, and 13 draws.

Life and work  He was born on 23 May 1905 in Berlin where he spent his youth and his first creative phase. In 1945, his studio and entire work were destroyed in the bombing raids of Berlin. He found refuge in Austria. In 1949, he moved in to the Hohensalzburg Castle, high over the roofs of the city of Salzburg, where he made his studio and lived for the rest of his life. Lehmann is well-known for his animal sculptures. He experimented with techniques, forms and glazing and created his own distinctive style. In the late 1950s, he was inspired by abstract art. He incorporated the ideas of cubism and used also metal, wire, wood and paper in his artworks. Arno Lehmann belongs to the greatest ceramicists of the 20th century. In 1955, Lehmann's ceramic sculpture of a gazelle was part of the exhibition Chefs-d'oeuvre de la c√©ramique moderne in Cannes and was awarded the gold metal by the International Academy of Ceramics (the jury was chaired by Pablo Picasso).

As a result of this, he has dedicated some of his compositional endeavors to American countries, such as his first symphony. The Double Concerto was finished in 2010, and it features the composer's most recognizable trait: a fluctuation between his avant-garde style and folk music. In this case, he uses two very well known Mexican folk melodies. The concerto was commissioned by Rudy Weingartner and is dedicated to him, to Eleanor Weingartner, a clarinetist, and Miguel Salazar, an oboist. Balada also made a reduction for two soloists and piano in 2010. The premiere was given by all three dedicatees with the Orquesta Filarm√≥nica del Estado de Quer√©taro on July 8, 2011. The concerto was published by Beteca Music.  Structure  The concerto is only in one movement and has a total duration of about 18 minutes.

The present ruins date from at least the end of the 18th century with structural evidence for six phases of development that finally ceased when the mill closed circa 1950. The mill was a two storey building, developed to become 'T' shaped complex when at a later stage a grain kiln was added. History Milbanck (sic) is recorded on Blaeu's maps of 1654 and 1662-5 although a mill is only suggested by the name itself. In 1796 the mill is depicted on a map by John Ainslie with the mill dam and mill pond located far up the glen at a 'T' junction of the lane that once ran to Auchenhane (sic) rather than the later location near the mill itself. The mill at that time is shown with two buildings above. The miller's dwelling may have doubled as a small farm as most millers had a second occupation in between the busy post- harvest times when the majority of milling took place. At Millmannoch near Coylton the miller also worked as a blacksmith when milling was not required. A Robert Or of Mylbank (sic) is mentioned in a 'Warrant for a Respite' in 1526 and another Robert Orr is recorded in the Poll Tax Register at Myllnebanck (sic) in 1695 with his wife Tean Breadine, daughters Isobel, Margaret and Jean with servants William Allan and Isobel Riddell.

Thirlage was the feudal law by which the laird (lord) could require all those farmers living on his lands to bring their grain to his mill to be ground. Additionally, they had to carry out repairs on the mill, maintain the lade and weir as well as conveying new millstones to the site. The width of some of the first roads was determined by the requirements of at least two people on either side of a grindstone with a wooden axle called a 'mill-wand'.Ferguson, Robert (2005). A Miller's Tale. The Life and Times of Dalgarven Mill. .Gauldie, Enid (1981). The Scottish Miller 1700 - 1900. Pub. John Donald. The Thirlage Law was repealed in 1779 and after this many mills fell out of use as competition and unsubsidised running costs took their toll. This may explain why so many mills went out of use whilst mills such as Millbank thrived due to their location and natural resources. Millbank Mill The corn mill was originally powered by the waters of the Millbank Burn that were originally stored behind a dam then located at the top of the glen, however sometime later a concrete dam was built closer to the mill and a sluice controlled the flow via a lade or mill race to the overshot waterwheel situated within the building. It is unclear as to how the water was delivered to the wheel previous to the concrete dam being built (prior to 1857), as a direct powering from the burn seems unlikely given the location. The dam remains in good condition and looks to be of no great age. A spillway or overflow was located between the sluice and the wooden section of the lade, the elevated head race that directed the water onto the top of the waterwheel inside the mill building. The section of the mill that housed the waterwheel. The mill had two sets of millstones that were composite, bound together with metal bands and possibly formed of Paris or French burrstone that was used for finer grinding and composed of sections that were cemented together with plaster. Well known millstone quarries were located at Kaim Hill near Fairlie in North Ayrshire. One millstone removed the husk from the grain and the other ground the corn down to meal. The waterwheel was 1m by 6m and had eight wooden spokes and wooden buckets. It had an iron axle and iron rings, the wheel pit and the wheel being enclosed within the two storey high stone walls of the main mill building. In 1910 the OS map shows that a lean to extension had been added to the gable end of the main mill building. By 1910 the Lochwinnoch 'Loop Line' had been built and it cut across the lane to East Lochhead with the railway crossing by an overbridge. A limestone quarry was located on the western side of the Millbank Burn accessible from the lane near Millbank Bridge and with a track leading into the nearby field. A short lade-like water channel still stands to the east of the Millbank Bridge running as a wall for a short distance parallel to the lane above. It was not present in 1857 and may have supplied water to the machinery of some sort, such as a water pump. This lade is shown on the 1895 OS map and on the 1910 map. It ends abruptly without re- joining the burn. Meikle Millbank Farm was the location of the miller's house and a dwelling has been recorded near Millbank Glen since at least the 17th century. Transport A lane ran from East Lochhead Farm to the mill over a well-built stone bridge and then joined the lane that runs to what is now Meikle Millbank Farm. A network of country lanes ran to nearby Lochwinnoch via the Leffox Bridge and to Kilbirnie via the Kerse and Hole farms. Micro- history In 1828 the 'Paisley Magazine' recorded that the minor poet Alexander Wilson, who lived at Auchenbathie Tower, wrote a poem \\"Rabbie's Mistak\\" concerning the hunting exploits of Robin Stirrat from Lochhead, the setting being Millbank Glen. In 1814 a scheme was carried out to drain the Barr Loch however the water level at the lowest point of the loch was too low to drain away naturally into the canal so a water-driven pump was installed at Hole of Barr to raise the water from the loch bed into the canal. Later this was converted to steam power and a tall chimney built. The ‚ÄòBarr Meadows‚Äô was around 170 acres and were used for growing oats or for rough grazing until in 1946 a lack of maintenance of the sluices led to the loch bed flooding once more.

Such types of tests are highly significant in regard to road safety. Testing is an indispensable step prior to manufacturing newly developed braking systems and enabling their utilization under real traffic circumstances. The effects of all factors other than human factors influencing the process of braking can be thoroughly tested in a testing environment designed to this end, i.e. on a braking test track.  Structure and characteristics  Several lanes enabling braking under different material characteristic conditions are necessary for testing as many of the circumstances that directly influence the braking effect as possible. Consequently, most of the traditional or so-called classic test tracks have several (5 to 8) differently paved braking lanes. Most test tracks attempt to provide surfaces with both higher and lower grip coefficients for the testing and developing companies. Asphalt (with a higher and lower coefficient), basalt, ceramic and concrete are frequently used materials for surface paving. Certain test tracks even have chequer surfaces with alternative tiles of higher and lower coefficients, increasing the challenge for intelligent braking systems. The number of settings provided by the available surfaces may be doubled by wetting them, for which mostly a 1‚Äì2 mm thick water coating is used. So-called aquaplaning lanes are also frequently provided for testers. The triggering of the phenomenon of aquaplaning, however, requires the provision of higher water levels. It is also important to provide for the collecting of the water spilled onto the wettable braking surfaces, which is in most cases managed by using ditches. In order to enable the testing of extreme braking situations, e.g. emergency braking from high speed, it is necessary for the lanes to be designed with a length of typically 150‚Äì250 m. Additionally acceleration lanes with the appropriate length are also required for reaching high speed, which enable even heavy-duty vehicles to reach 100 km/h. This way it becomes possible to test the braking systems of trucks and buses. An adequate amount of data and test results are necessary to draw the conclusions, which can be achieved by repeated tests. In order to perform repeated tests fluently and safely it is necessary to design a route separated from the test (braking) zone that allows the test vehicle to return to the beginning of the acceleration lane quickly and safely.  Goal and utilization = The significance of braking system testing = The braking systems of vehicles, especially those of motorised vehicles play a highly important role in road safety. The activation of the braking systems decelerates and stops the vehicle (or keeps it in an immobile standing position, e.g. with the handbrake). Depending on the country, different national or occasionally international regulations apply to braking systems. The braking effect of an installed system depends on several factors, e.g. on the human factors (routine, health condition and mental state of the driver), technical factors (structure of the system, technical condition of the individual components), weather (e.g. wet, icy surfaces), and the condition and quality of the pavement. Braking test tracks enable the testing of such technical, meteorological and pavement factors. = Traditional tests = Most traditional test tracks are equipped with surfaces suitable for testing ABS, ATC, ESP systems as well as brakeforce intervention systems connected to all braking systems. At the same time such surfaces are also suitable for the testing of other active systems. = Automatic Emergency Braking System tests = The number of necessary vehicle industry tests has multiplied with the implementation of ADAS (advanced driver-assistance systems). The combining of several functions has made the planned tests more complex too. Recently an increasing number of cars are equipped with emergency braking systems. Such systems need to be capable of sensing an obstacle which triggers the command that initiates the braking; at the same time, however, the appropriate intervention (braking) is also indispensable. Protocols for such tests, which all developers strive to comply with (Euro NCAP active safety system tests), already exist; these tests are conducted, however, under highly limited, well predefined circumstances. It is practical to carry out such tests on several different surfaces. = Platooning tests = Platooning tests, i.e. testing vehicles advancing in convoy pose a further challenge. A typical situation to be tested is when the first vehicle produces a signal for intervention (which could even be an intervention based on sensing), and then transmits it to the following vehicles, which need to receive and process the signal with the least possible latency, and initiate the necessary intervention. = Other tests = It is not unusual to use a braking test track for testing the efficiency of the braking system of a vehicle crossing several different lanes angularly.  Braking test tracks on existing proving grounds  Most proving grounds in Europe have braking test tracks. The most well-known examples are the Boxberg Proving Ground constructed by Bosch (Germany), Automotive Testing Papenburg GmbH constructed by Daimler (Germany), Applus Idiada (Spain), Aldenhoven Testing Center (Germany). The Zalaegerszeg Test Track currently under construction in Hungary will also feature a braking test track. = Boxberg Proving Ground, Boxberg, Germany = The braking test track of the Boxberg Proving Ground provides testing opportunities under various grip conditions on its seven lanes differing in quality and grip and its track sections equipped with track wetting functions. The surface of the braking test track is partially shared with one of the acceleration lanes of the dynamic platform. Available lanes: chequered lane, asphalt, ceramic, basalt (polished), concrete, aquaplaning lane, basalt concrete. = Automotive Testing Papenburg GmbH, Papenburg, Germany = The 300 m long braking test track of the Papenburg Test Ground provides testing opportunities on eight lanes differing in quality and grip, which can be wetted as preferred; furthermore which are connected through a 280 long and 30 m wide acceleration lane to the oval platform, thus enabling acceleration to higher speeds. The braking test track is closed with a 150 m long asphalt safety surface. Available lanes: chequered lane, asphalt (100 m aquaplaning lane), mixed basalt & asphalt, basalt (polished), asphalt, concrete, ‚Äúblue asphalt‚Äù. = Aldenhoven Testing Center, Aldenhoven, Germany = The length of the braking test track at the Aldenhoven Testing Center is 150 m, which contains an asphalt and a ceramic pavement lane. Both lanes are 4 m wide and may be wetted as preferred. The braking test lane is surrounded on both sides by a safety zone. A 200 m access acceleration lane is also part of the braking test track. = Applus Idiada, Spain, Tarragona = The braking test track at Applus Idiada is divided into two separate zones. Zone 1 may be used only by one a vehicle at a time. The surface used for the braking tests is 250 m long and has five lanes with different kinds of pavement. The lanes may be wetted as preferred. The braking test track is closed with a safety area. Lanes: concrete, basalt, asphalt, ceramic, aquaplaning lane Zone 2 may be used by two vehicles simultaneously, as there is a dividing area between the two lanes used for braking tests. Both lanes are 250 m long and 5 m wide and are paved with asphalt; one of them, however, is not wettable. = Zala ZONE Vehicle Industry Test Track, Zalaegerszeg, Hungary = The braking test track under construction at the Zala ZONE Vehicle Industry Test Track is designed for testing ABS, ATC and ESP systems; it has six special, differently paved and lanes, which can be wetted separately by the inbuilt wetting and draining system. Its 700 m acceleration lane and 200 m long braking surface enables the testing of longer combination vehicles as well.

Early life Watson was born at 11 Vennel, Edinburgh on 13 July 1900, the daughter of Agnes Newton and Horatio Watson, a bookbinder for George Watson's printing company. Watson was encouraged to take up piping at the age of seven or eight as her parents hoped it would strengthen her lungs against tuberculosis after her aunt Margaret died of the disease. Her first set of pipes was a half sized set made by Robertson, the pipe maker.  Involvement with suffragette campaign  After seeing an advert for a pageant of historical Scottish women organised by Flora Drummond and the Women's Social and Political Union, Watson and her mother joined the WSPU and Watson, at the age of 9, was invited to play the pipes in the pageant. The procession, which celebrated ‚ÄòWhat women have done and can and will do' took place in Edinburgh on 9 October 1909 and marched down Princes Street before gathering for a rally led by Emmeline Pankhurst at Waverley Market. Watson rode on a float beside a woman dressed as Isabella McDuff, Countess of Buchan in her cage. Several weeks later when Christabel Pankhurst came to Edinburgh to attend a meeting in the King's Theatre, she presented Watson with a brooch depicting Boudica in her chariot. In 1979 Bessie gave this brooch to Margaret Thatcher, the first women to be elected as Prime Minister of the UK. Two years after the pageant Watson was invited to lead the Scottish 'lady' pipers at the Great Pageant in London on 17 June 1911. Later the same year, when King George V came to Edinburgh on a state visit, Watson led the 2nd Edinburgh Company of the Girl Guides and was recognised by the King as she raised the salute. Watson continued to be actively involved in the Suffragette movement and wore hair ribbons in the colours of the Suffragette campaign to school. She played the pipes on the platform of Waverley Station as trains departed taking convicted women's rights campaigners to Holloway Prison, and she piped outside Calton Jail to encourage the Suffragettes imprisoned there. A century later this location is now St Andrew's House, home of the Scottish Ministers and civil servants. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on 1 August 2019 unveiled a memorial plaque to Watson at her home in the Vennel, saying \\"I go into work in the morning to the place where Bessie would have played and knowing that I go in there now as the first woman to be First Minister of Scotland.\\"  Piping career  Watson became the only female member of the Highland Piper's Society at the age of 14, and won a number of piping awards. She also founded the Broughton School Pipe Band, which she led for 27 years. Watson continued to play the pipes daily into her late 80s. Watson studied French at the University of Edinburgh, and taught violin and modern languages in schools across the city. In 1926 Watson moved to Trinity, Edinburgh with her parents, and in 1945, at the end of World War II, she married John Somerville an electrical contractor. Watson died in Edinburgh in 1992, two weeks before her 92nd birthday. She left her autobiography, practice chanter and pipes to the College of Piping in Glasgow.

It was a short line, and it opened in 1856. It was not commercially successful, and the directors sought a means of connecting Stamford directly to Peterborough. This was the Sibson Extension, opened from Stamford to Wansford in 1867, but the junction there did not facilitate through running to Peterborough, and the Sibson Extension was even less successful than the first line. It was closed in 1929. The company had a separate Stamford station from the Midland Railway's through station, and after nationalisation the Essendine trains ran into the MR station, from 1957. Nevertheless the Essendine line was greatly loss-making and the passenger service closed in 1959, followed by the complete closure of the line in 1963.. Railways at Stamford The Stamford and Essendine RailwayIn the nineteenth century Stamford was an important market town on the Great North Road. The Midland Railway opened its line from Melton Mowbray to Stamford on 20 March 1848 for goods traffic and 19 June 1848 for passengers. The line was soon extended to Peterborough. The Great Northern Railway was not so early to reach the area, but it opened its main line from Werrington Junction, north of Peterborough, to Retford on 15 July 1852 for goods traffic and 1 August 1852 for passengers. The Great Northern Railway main line, destined to be the important trunk route forming the East Coast Main Line, by-passed Stamford, although it originally planned to run through the town. Goodman, writing in 1908, said that it \\"seems inexplicable that the main line... should be so planned as to pass by a prosperous market town of 8,000 inhabitants at a distance of barely 4 miles\\". Seeing themselves at a disadvantage, local people, led by the Marquis of Exeter, formed the idea of making their own branch line from Stamford to the GNR main line at Essendine. The Marquis of Exeter had his seat at Burghley House in Stamford. Stamford and Essendine Railway authorised Stamford S&ER; station frontageThe scheme for a railway connection went to the 1853 Parliamentary session, and the Stamford and Essendine Railway obtained authorisation on 15 August 1853. The Midland Railway bitterly opposed the scheme. Their hostility was magnified because the Act authorised the S&ER; to make a connection to the Midland Railway station at Stamford and to secure running powers into it. The capital of the S&ER; was ¬£50,000. A contract for the construction was let on 21 August 1854. Midland Railway hostility had been so violent during the process of land acquisition that for the time being the S&ER; company decided to make an independent station at Stamford to avoid use of the Midland Railway station. In 1856 the line was considered to be ready for opening, and Lt Col George Wynne made a visit for the purpose of the Board of Trade inspection, which was required for passenger operation. He visited on 12 September 1856, but he refused the authorisation for a number of reasons; chief among these was that the ballast under sleepers was only 3 to 7 inches in depth at trial holes he had taken out. The company made the required improvements and Wynne visited again on 14 October 1856; this time he was satisfied, and approval for the opening of the line was given. Opening Stamford GNR stationThe line opened for traffic on 1 November 1856; the train service was four trains each way daily; the Great Northern Railway had agreed to work the line for 50% of gross income. The line ran to Essendine station on the GNR main line; the junction faced northwards there. There were no intermediate stations, and the line was single; Stamford passenger trains used a bay platform at Essendine. At this period the small town of Bourne also sought a connection to the Great Northern Railway. The Bourne and Essendine Railway was incorporated by Act of Parliament of 12 August 1857, with capital of ¬£48,000. S&ER; receipts for the half year ending December 1858 were reported to be ¬£1,418. This was considered satisfactory, and encouraged the directors, led by the Marquis of Exeter, to plan the provision of double track. The formation had been made for double track, and a second track was quickly laid, except for a distance of 400 yards approaching Essendine: there was not enough space close to the junction with the GNR. Nevertheless the Board of Trade were requested to inspect the line for opening as a double track, even though the second track was not connected at Essendine, and no signalling had been provided for it. The directors were unable to state what method of safe working they proposed. The Board of Trade inspecting officer made three further visits in 1859; in every case he was unable to authorise opening of the second track, and eventually it was removed, and the proposal forgotten. The Bourne and Essendine Railway opened for traffic on 16 May 1860, with intermediate stations at Braceborough Spa and Thurlby. Its junction at Essendine also faced northwards, like the S&ER; junction, but on the east side of the GNR main line. It had been contemplated that through trains could be run from Stamford to Bourne and on to Spalding. However the junctions at Essendine were such that the Stamford line and the Bourne line entered bay platforms on their respective sides of the GNR main line, and through running would have involved a backshunt crossing all the GNR tracks. That was ruled out by the GNR as unsafe and likely to cause delay to main line running. An alternative proposed was for the Bourne line to enter Essendine from the south directly to the S&ER; platform, but it would still need to cross all the GNR lines, and that too was unacceptable operationally. Sibson extension Passengers travelling from Stamford to London found that taking Midland Railway trains to Peterborough and changing there was more convenient than changing at Essendine. There were more connections available at Peterborough. This led the S&ER; to consider construction of an independent line to Peterborough, but this would have been unaffordable, running alongside the hostile Midland Railway all the way. As an alternative the S&ER; considered building a line from Stamford southward to Wansford, forming a junction there with the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) line from Oundle to Peterborough.If this was intended to attract Stamford to London passengers away from the Midland route to Peterborough, it is difficult to see how it could have been successful. The LNWR trains ran into the GER station at Peterborough, not the GNR station, and running powers for S&ER; trains to Peterborough were not granted. Accordingly passengers from Stamford to London using the route would have had to change trains at Wansford, and change stations at Peterborough. A Bill was presented in the 1862 session; the issue of the connection to the Midland Railway station at Stamford was also included. The Midland Railway offered such determined opposition that the whole Bill was thrown out. At this time the Marquis of Exeter offered to sell the S&ER; line to the GNR for ¬£100,000; this was more than the assessed capital value of the line and the offer was refused. The Bourne and Essendine Railway was faring badly financially, and the GNR threatened to stop working it on the grounds that they were losing money, but the working charge was increased to 60%, and they agreed to continue. The GNR absorbed the almost- worthless Bourne and Essendine Railway company by Act of 16 May 1864. The S&ER; extension to Wansford became known as the Sibson Extension, and was presented in Parliament once again. It fared better this time; the issue of the connection at Stamford to the Midland Railway had been omitted and as a result the Midland Railway did not oppose the scheme. The Royal Assent was given on 25 July 1864; an additional share issue of ¬£75,000 was authorised to pay for the work. Running powers to Wansford LNWR station were granted under the Act, but onwards to Peterborough was not included. Moreover if the junction at Essendine had wrongly been formed facing away from Peterborough, the error was repeated at Wansford, where the junction faced away from Peterborough. The GNR had agreed to work the S&ER; original main line for 50% of income, but (as on the Bourne line) the work was loss-making to them. The original working agreement was due to expire on 1 November 1864, and the GNR demanded a higher payment, but the Marquis of Exeter said that the S&ER; would work the line themselves, and gave notice that they would do so from the due date. GNR asked ¬£10 annually for use of Essendine station. Connecting the Midland Railway at Stamford In 1866 the Midland and Eastern Railway was formed by amalgamation of the Lynn and Sutton Bridge Railway and the Spalding and Bourne Railway. The intention had been to build westward from Bourne to Saxby to join the Midland Railway there (as was done later in forming the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway). The GNR opposed this scheme, and in negotiation offered the Midland through running at Essendine over the Bourne and Essendine Railway, which by then had been over by the GNR) and the S&ER.; The Midland Company sought this access eastwards, and found that it was in its own interest to facilitate the junction at Stamford. There was a technical issue: the MR were concerned that the end of the junction tracks would be on an S&ER; viaduct considered to be in poor condition, and they insisted on its conversion to an embankment. That work was done and the junction came into use on 1 July 1867. The difficulty over through running at Essendine was also overcome, as the GNR ran three mixed trains daily from Stamford to Lynn via Bourne and Spalding. The Stamford and Essendine Railway in 1867The Sibson Extension was inspected by Captain H W Tyler on 3 July 1867, and the following day he looked at the Stamford connection. He considered that several minor issues were still unresolved, and more seriously there was no statement of the intended method of working the Sibson line, so he declined permission to open to passenger operation. He made a second visit on 19 July 1867, but he was still not satisfied, mainly due to signalling shortcomings. He made a third visit on 2 August 1867, and this time he approved the opening, which was \\"officially opened\\" on 8 August 1867 (probably a ceremonial opening) and a public opening to passengers and goods took place on 9 August 1867; there were five trains each way. Withdrawal from Wansford The receipts of the Sibson Extension were very disappointing, and the S&ER; considered the charges made by the LNWR for the use of Wansford station to be excessive. The LNWR was intransigent and the S&ER; decided to stop using Wansford station and use a new temporary station north of the junction, on its own line. The new station, named Sibson, opened on 1 January 1870, and S&ER; trains ceased to run on to Wansford. Once again the Marquis of Exeter attempted to sell the line to the GNR, but they were still not interested. They agreed to work the line for 50% of receipts in the case of the Essendine line, and 70% in the case of the Sibson line. This was agreed and they resumed working the line from 1 January 1872. In December 1877 the Sibson connection had been reinstated and was stated to be ready for inspection; Col Yolland visited for the necessary Board of Trade inspection, but he was dissatisfied with the signalling arrangements. Remedial work was carried out and everything was ready at the end of February 1878. Trains ran through from 1 March 1878, and the Sibson station closed. Lease to the Great Northern Railway The GNR agreed a lease of the S&ER; lines on 15 December 1893; it was to be a lease in perpetuity from 1 January 1894 at a rent of ¬£3,000 for ten years, and then ¬£3,500 annually. By 1914 the Essendine line had fifteen return trains daily, while the Sibson Extension had eight. The \\"grouping\\" of the railways took place in 1923, following the Railways Act 1921. The Great Northern Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). There were complications due to the terms of the perpetual lease, which contained a clause that elevated the lease charge if the line was connected to a through route. The S&E; shareholders got LNER 4% debentures \\"at good value\\". The LNER later reviewed the profitability of the Stamford to Wansford line: it was operating at a loss of ¬£2,956 a year, and closure was proposed. The decision was ratified and the line closed to all traffic on 29 June 1929. The railways were nationalised in 1948, and the LNER lines as well as the former Midland Railway lines became part of British Railways. Under unified management the duplication of the Stamford stations was reviewed; it was obvious that the separate Stamford East station was wasteful, and it was closed to passengers on 4 March 1957. Passenger trains were handled at the Midland Railway station. Closure Passenger usage of the Stamford to Essendine line was very light; most passengers who used the line changed trains at Essendine to reach Peterborough or London, and it was obvious that those passengers could use the former Midland line to Peterborough instead. Closure to passengers was proposed, and the passenger service ceased on 15 June 1959. On the same day Essendine and other intermediate stations on the former GNR main line closed. The East Yard at Stamford closed to goods on 4 March 1963.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. History Portland was first settled in the 1830s. Milling operations began along the Looking Glass River near this district in 1836, and the first portion of the village of Portland was platted in 1837. The section of Portland encompassing the business district was platted in 1838. Around the same time, the first building in the district was erected by William R. Churchill at what is now the east corner of Kent and Bridge Streets. The building was soon occupied by Joshua Boyer, who opened the Mansion House, a tavern and hotel. Some additional buildings were constructed in the district in the 1840s, as well as a bridge across the Grand River, and more at the village grew in the 1850s; although documentation is sparse, it is clear that by the late 1860s that Portland had a substantial business district. In 1869, the first railroad (what was later the Detroit, Lansing and Northern Railroad) was constructed through Portland, and with it came a rush of prosperity. The three-story Knox & White block opened in the downtown, marking the start of a building boom that saw the downtown transformed. The oldest still extant buildings, the Bowser Brothers Building at 160 Kent, and two wooden buildings at 143 and 147 Kent, were constructed in 1872. Major fires in 1872 and 1877 destroyed many of the older wooden buildings, and in 1877 the village mandated that further construction within the district be brick. These fires, along with later ones in 1879 and 1885, made way for the new Victorian construction on the commercial district. Portland's population growth slowed after 1880, but the business district slowly grew, extending southwestward down Kent Street to Academy by the late 1910s. Many older buildings had street-front renovations in the first few decades of the 20th century. In 1919 and 1920, Grand River Avenue was developed as an automotive trunkline connecting Grand Rapids and Lansing, and the section running through Portland was redeveloped from liveries and blacksmith shops to new automobile- related businesses. However, the onset of the Great Depression halted building in the village. After World War II, more of the commercial buildings in the district were refurbished, and some new construction took place, notably the 1948-49 Sun Theatre at 227 Maple Street. However, most of the district retains a late-nineteenth century ambiance. Description The Portland Downtown Historic District includes most of Portland's central business district. It contains 49 buildings, as well as the 1890 Bridge Street bridge. Many of the buildings are late Victorian commercial blocks constructed in the 1870s and 80s. However, the district is notable for the variety of buildings present, including modernized wooden falsefront buildings, the brick Late Victorian blocks, a Neoclassical bank, early 20th century Commercial Brick buildings, a Moderne movie theater, and an International Style bank. Significant structures in the district include: * Bridge Street Bridge: Built in 1890 by the Groton Bridge and Manufacturing Company, the bridge is a two-span metal Pratt through truss structure with pinned connections. It is 210 feet in length and 24 in width, with a sidewalk. The bridge was rehabilitated in 1990, and is still open to traffic. * William R. Churchill House/Neller Funeral Home (210 Bridge): This two-story hip-roof frame Italianate house was constructed in the 1860s for one of Portland's first businessman, William R. Churchill. It was converted into a funeral parlor in 1932. * Opera House Block (136 Kent): This three-story two-storefront building was constructed in 1880. The facade is of red brick, with five yellow-buff brick piers running the full height of the building. The second floor contains the opera house and ticket booth, with a flight of stairs up to the balcony. * Bowser Brothers Block (160 Kent): This two-story brick ltalianate commercial building was built in 1872, and is the oldest solid brick-wall building in Portland's business district. * Doctors' Offices (226 Kent): This one-story wooden commercial building with false front was constructed in the late 1870s. * Decker (Powers) Building (131 Kent): This two-story frame gable-front building was constructed in the 1860s/70s, and is likely the oldest commercial building in the downtown. During the 1900 and 1913 timeframe the building housed what may have been Portland's first movie theater. *Maynard-Allen State Bank (175 Kent): Built in 1950/51, this is a two-story International Style commercial building produced by renovating two earlier buildings. * Sun Theater (227 Maple): This rectangular concrete and cinder block Moderne movie theater building was built in 1948/49. It is a highly intact example of the simple Moderne movie theaters once common in Michigan.

It is an instance of the popular Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm that extends its use to cases where the target density is not available analytically. It relies on the fact that the Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm can still sample from the correct target distribution if the target density in the acceptance ratio is replaced by an estimate. It is especially popular in Bayesian statistics, where it is applied if the likelihood function is not tractable (see example below).  Algorithm description  The aim is to simulate from some probability density function \\\\pi(\\\\theta) . The algorithm follows the same steps as the standard Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm except that the evaluation of the target density is replaced by a non-negative and unbiased estimate. For comparison, the main steps of a Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm are outlined below. = Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm = Given a current state \\\\theta_n the Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm proposes a new state according to some density \\\\theta'\\\\sim Q( \\\\cdot \\\\mid \\\\theta_n). The algorithm then sets \\\\theta_{n+1} = \\\\theta' with probability :a(\\\\theta_n, \\\\theta') = \\\\min\\\\left(1,\\\\frac{\\\\pi(\\\\theta')}{\\\\pi(\\\\theta_n)}\\\\frac{Q(\\\\theta_n\\\\mid\\\\theta')}{Q(\\\\theta'\\\\mid\\\\theta_n)}\\\\right) otherwise the old state is kept, that is, \\\\theta_{n+1}=\\\\theta_n. = Pseudo- marginal Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm = If the density \\\\pi is not available analytically the above algorithm cannot be employed. The pseudo-marginal Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm in contrast only assumes the existence of an estimator \\\\hat{\\\\pi}_\\\\theta with \\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\hat{\\\\pi}_\\\\theta] = \\\\pi(\\\\theta). Now, given \\\\theta_n and the respective estimate \\\\hat{\\\\pi}_{\\\\theta_n} the algorithm proposes a new state according to some density \\\\theta'\\\\sim Q( \\\\cdot \\\\mid \\\\theta_n). Next, compute an estimate \\\\hat{\\\\pi}_{\\\\theta'} and set \\\\theta_{n+1} = \\\\theta' with probability : a(\\\\theta_n, \\\\theta') = \\\\min\\\\left( 1, \\\\frac{\\\\hat{\\\\pi}_{\\\\theta'}}{\\\\hat{\\\\pi}_{\\\\theta_n}} \\\\frac{Q(\\\\theta_n\\\\mid\\\\theta')}{Q(\\\\theta'\\\\mid\\\\theta_n)}\\\\right) otherwise the old state is kept, that is, \\\\theta_{n+1}=\\\\theta_n.  Application to Bayesian statistics  In Bayesian statistics the target of inference is the posterior distribution :p(\\\\theta \\\\mid y) = \\\\frac{p_\\\\theta(y)p(\\\\theta)}{p(y)}, where p_\\\\theta denotes the likelihood function, p is the prior and p(y) is the prior predictive distribution. Since there is often no analytic expression of this quantity, one often relies on Monte Carlo methods to sample from the distribution instead. Monte Carlo methods often need the likelihood p_\\\\theta(y) to be accessible for every parameter value \\\\theta. In some cases, however, the likelihood does not have an analytic expression. An example of such a case is outlined below. = Example: Latent variable model= Consider a model consisting of i.i.d. latent real-valued random variables Z_1,\\\\ldots,Z_n with Z_i \\\\sim f_\\\\theta(\\\\cdot) and suppose one can only observe these variables through some additional noise Y_i \\\\mid Z_i = z \\\\sim g_\\\\theta(\\\\cdot\\\\mid z) for some conditional density g. (This could be due to measurement error, for instance.) We are interested in Bayesian analysis of this model based on some observed data y_1, \\\\ldots, y_n. Therefore, we introduce some prior distribution p(\\\\theta) on the parameter. In order to compute the posterior distribution : p(\\\\theta \\\\mid y_1, \\\\ldots, y_n) \\\\propto p_\\\\theta(y_1, \\\\ldots, y_n) p(\\\\theta) we need to find the likelihood function p_\\\\theta(y_1, \\\\ldots, y_n). The likelihood contribution of any observed data point y is then : p_\\\\theta(y) = \\\\int g_\\\\theta(y \\\\mid z)f_\\\\theta(z) \\\\, dz and the joint likelihood of the observed data y_1, \\\\ldots, y_n is : p_\\\\theta(y_1, \\\\ldots, y_n) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^n p_\\\\theta(y_i) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\int g_\\\\theta(y_i \\\\mid z_i)f_\\\\theta(z_i) \\\\, dz_i. If the integral on the right-hand side is not analytically available, importance sampling can be used to estimate the likelihood. Introduce an auxiliary distribution q such that g_\\\\theta(y\\\\mid z)f_\\\\theta(z) > 0 \\\\Rightarrow q(z) > 0 for all z then : \\\\hat{p}_\\\\theta(y_i)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{k=1}^N \\\\frac{g_\\\\theta(y_i \\\\mid Z_k)f_\\\\theta(Z_k)}{q(Z_k)}, \\\\qquad Z_k \\\\overset{i.i.d.}{\\\\sim} q(\\\\cdot) is an unbiased estimator of p_\\\\theta(y_i) and the joint likelihood can be estimated unbiasedly by : \\\\hat{p}_\\\\theta(y_1, \\\\ldots, y_n) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\hat{p}_\\\\theta(y_i) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{k=1}^N \\\\frac{g_\\\\theta(y_i \\\\mid Z_{i,k}) f_\\\\theta(Z_{i,k})}{q(Z_{i,k})}, \\\\qquad Z_{i,k} \\\\overset{i.i.d.}{\\\\sim} q(\\\\cdot).

It consists of numerous Pleistocene basaltic andesite lava flows, as well as cinder cones with Holocene basaltic lava flows. Most centres are roughly aligned in northeast-southwest direction. The volcanic field lies in the Puna, a high plateau generated by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate. The terrain consists mainly of Miocene volcaniclastic rocks with a single outcrop of Ordovician granodiorite. Parts of the area are covered by Quaternary alluvium and conglomerates. The basement rocks are influenced by normal faulting. The volcanism in the field has been explained by lithospheric delamination, a process by which part of the lower lithosphere founders into the mantle. Such a process is accompanied by uplift of the abovelying crust and often by volcanism of mainly small volume. Seismic imagery has been used to argue for the existence of delaminated crust in the mantle above the downgoing Nazca Plate slab beneath the Arizaro region. The age of the lavas has been determined by argon-argon dating. The northernmost lava flow has yielded an age of 80,000 ¬± 60,000 years before present, while a southern lava flow has been dated to 130,000 ¬± 10,000 years before present and a date of 2.52 ¬± 0.05 million years ago was found on a central lava flow; this last lava flow shows evidence of younger faulting.

They were executed on December 2, 1603 in Place de Gr√®ve in Paris for adultery and incest. Background Julien de Ravalet was born in 1582 and Marguerite de Ravalet was born in 1586 in a family of eleven brothers and sisters. They grew up in Le Ch√¢teau des Ravalet, now more commonly known as Ch√¢teau de Tourlaville, located in Tourlaville. History Since childhood, Julien and Marguerite were close friends and confidants, preferring to spend time with each other as much as possible rather than with anyone else. By the time they reached adolescence, this intimate friendship raised suspicions with their parents, who felt it was appropriate to separate the siblings. They sent Julien to the college of Coutances at age thirteen but upon his return three years later, they continued to conspire to keep their children apart and began arranging a marriage for their daughter. On March 20, 1600, thirteen-year-old Marguerite was married to Jean L√®fevre de Haupitois, a nouveau rich nobleman who was thirty-two years-old, at the Notre-Dame de Tourlaville church. Although he lacked the noble rank of the de Ravelet family, L√®fevre built his wealth from the collector's charge of royal tax. Meanwhile, Julien was sent to Paris to pursue theological studies. In August 1601, Marguerite gave birth to a daughter, Louise, but her and L√®fevre's marriage was an unhappy one. L√®fevre was prone to moments of unprovoked rage and jealousy, and he was physically abusive towards his wife. Marguerite was desperate to escape from her loveless marriage but she received no sympathy from her parents, who encouraged her to stay with her husband. Ultimately, in early 1602, she fled back to Tourlaville, leaving her husband and daughter behind. Julien happened to be visiting Tourlaville at the same time. For a short time, the brother and sister were happy and unsuspected of their relationship. However, rumors began to spread among the chateau; their intimate jokes, silly games, and disappearing together for hours raised suspicions of an intimate relationship. A servant even caught the two sharing a bed at one point. Lef√®vre alerted the authorities of his wife's abandonment and sent a letter to the chateau, accusing the siblings of engaging in an incestuous relationship. They denied the charges and, on December 2, 1602, they ran away to Fougeres, 120 miles away from their ancestral home, where they lived together for a few months. During this time, it is believed they began a romantic and sexual relationship, treating each other as husband and wife. Within weeks of arriving in Fougeres, Marguerite became pregnant. Towards the end of August 1603, they heard Lefevre may have discovered their whereabouts and they set out for Paris, arriving on September 7 and taking separate hotels. Two days later, Lef√®vre filed a complaint at the Grand Ch√¢telet, accusing Marguerite and Julien of adultery and incest. Commissioner Cassebras followed up on the accusations immediately, and the siblings were apprehended and arrested.Paul Le Cacheux Le proc√®s des Ravalet archive Saint-L√¥ 1911. Accompanied by a sergeant and guards, Lef√®vre and the Commissioner surprised a clearly pregnant Marguerite in bed at her hotel, alone. The siblings were charged with adultery and incest, both punishable by death at the time. Trial On September 19, 1603, the trial of Julien and Marguerite de Ravalet began at the Parlement de Paris. Marguerite, who was heavily pregnant and had been separated from her husband for over a year, was questioned on who the father of her child was. Marguerite denied the charges and alleged her pregnancy was the result of a rape by a traveling tailor, who attacked her during her stay in Tourlaville. She claimed she had gone to Paris to follow a religious vocation. Julien's defense against the charges was his claim of saving his sister from an unhappy marriage and that the incest accusation stemmed from a jealous husband who misinterpreted a hug between the two. Between September 20 and 25, Marguerite gave birth to a son named Julien II de Ravalet, who was swiftly removed from her care and placed with their older brother, Philippe, and ended up being raised by Julien and Marguerite's parents. The evidence presented against the siblings was a series of letters exchanged between the two over a three-year period of 1600 through 1603, detailing intimate conversations that strongly hinted at a passionate and sexual relationship. Between November 24 and 27, the letters were read in a public hearing. Witnesses, varying from servants, acquaintances and L√®fevre all testified Marguerite wanted to stay with her brother at all times and the two appeared to be in love, and dates regarding the conception and birth of Marguerite's child corresponded with the time period in which she was traveling with Julien. On December 1, the court found them guilty on all charges and sentenced them to death. Their father, Jean de Ravalet, petitioned King Henri IV at the Louvre for a pardon. Henri was sympathetic but L√®fevre was adamant that the sentence be carried out. Henri ultimately rejected Jean de Ravalet's pleas for clemency because, as a married woman, Marguerite's crime of adultery and her pregnancy were crimes against God. In his decision, the king was quoted by contemporary writer Pierre de L'Estoile to have said: \\"If the woman would not have been married, I would have gladly given her pardon, but as she is, I could not.\\" Henri did make one concession: after the execution their father was given the corpses of his children. They would not be exhibited at the Montfaucon gallows as was customary. On December 2, 1603, Julien and Marguerite arrived at the Place de Gr√®ve for execution. They were each given a chance to confess and Marguerite, in a desperate attempt to save her brother, confessed she was solely guilty and she had bewitched him. Julien refused to confess nor implicate his sister. As the execution was beginning, a crowd of people began to gather in support of the siblings and pleaded for them to be spared. Nevertheless, they were executed by decapitation. Marguerite's final words were \\"In your hands, Lord.\\" Julien was 21 and Marguerite was 17. The siblings were entombed in the church of Saint-Jean-en-Gr√®ve, in Paris, bearing the epitaph ‚ÄúHere lie the brother and sister. You who pass by, do not inquire as to the cause of their death, but go and pray to God for their souls.‚Äù Aftermath After the execution, Marguerite's two children, Louise and Julien II, were later declared beneficiaries to the chateau of Tourlaville. However, in the few years that followed, Jean de Ravalet gave away large sums of his wealth in endowments to local churches for the benefit of the poor. In 1625, Jean de Ravalet made a large donation to a Benedictine convent in Cherbourg. In 1653, Jean de Ravalet died and left the chateau to a nephew, but having given all his fortune to charity, the estate was penniless. The chateau was sold, and the remaining de Ravalet family members relocated to various areas across Europe. The church the siblings were entombed in was demolished between 1797 and 1800. Legacy The tale of Julien and Marguerite de Ravelet is said to have inspired John Ford‚Äôs 17th century play 'Tis Pity She's a Whore. A French film, Marguerite & Julien, was directed by Valerie Donzelli and released in 2015. It depicts a modern version of the story and retains historical elements to it.

V. (Union of Sparda-Banks). Traditionally they are specialized in the private banking business. The eleven, legally independent banks operate according to the regional principle, which means that each bank is responsible for a set business area and only accepts customers from that area. Development The oldest Sparda-Bank was founded on 6 May 1896 as Spar- und Vorschuss-Verein der badischen Eisenbahnbeamten (Savings and Imprest Association of the Baden Railroad Officials) in Karlsruhe. Based on this model equal cooperatives were founded in other places, which, in the spring of 1906, consolidated in the Revisionsverband der Eisenbahn-Spar- und Darlehnskassen (Revision Federation of the Railroad Savings and Loan Associations) in Kassel. In 1969 the railroad savings banks were opened for staff of other public services and in 1974 for all employees (steady income in the salary account is expected). Since 1978 the banks uniformly call themselves Sparda-Banks. In the center of its business activities is the standardized private banking. Customers purchase at least one cooperative share (the amount and the maximum of available shares is determined individually by each bank in a statute) and are therefore, together with other customers, members and part owners of the bank. For the cooperative shares an annual dividend is paid (at the Sparda-Bank S√ºd-West currently 3%, at the Sparda-Bank Baden-W√ºrttemberg 3.5%). Check account The Sparda-Banks check account (excluding Sparda-Bank Berlin since October 1, 2017) is free of charge for members as wage, salary or retirement account. However, since 2015, Sparda-Banks charge annually different amounts for the Bankcard. Cooperative The following Sparda-Banks are consolidated in the Verband der Sparda-Banken e. V. (Union of Sparda-Banks) which as auditing association is responsible for the statutory audits according to the cooperative bill: * Sparda-Bank Augsburg * Sparda-Bank Baden-W√ºrttemberg (in Stuttgart, fusion with Sparda-Bank Karlsruhe) * Sparda-Bank Berlin * Sparda-Bank Hamburg * Sparda-Bank Hannover * Sparda-Bank Hessen * Sparda-Bank Munich * Sparda-Bank N√ºrnberg * Sparda-Bank OstBayern (in Regensburg) * Sparda-Bank S√ºdwest * Sparda-Bank West (fusion of Sparda-Banks in Essen, Wuppertal and Cologne) The Sparda-Banks are members in the National Association of German Cooperative Banks (BVR) and its protection scheme.

A few Sparda-Banks have agreements for a free of charge cash withdrawal at Postbank ATMs. Business figures In sum the total assets of all Sparda-Banks was 68.9 billion Euros in 2016. At the end of 2016 the number of all members of Sparda-Banks was 3.6 million.

Design This architectural monument is one of the rare types in Arran's architectural style to be built with baked bricks. Its domes are consolidated from both inside and outside. Bahman Mirza Qajar was buried in the third room from entrance, which is also middle of the last room. The grave is built of a kind of tomb style. There are six inscriptions on the black marble on the inner walls of the dome. The texts are written in plain text, and the texts are related to the verses of the Koran: The life of the buried man is described as full of agony, frustration, longing, and shaking. Bahman Mirza The person buried in the grave is Bahman Mirza Qajar, scientist and historian from the Qajar dynasty. Bahman Mirza bin Naib As-Sultan Abbas Mirza, was the son of a prince. According to Raudet Uc-Safayi Nasiri, he was fourth in the age group of 26 surviving sons of Abbas Mirza. He was born in 1810. In his work, Tazgireyi Mohammed-Shahi, it is noted that at the time of his youth, his father appointed him ruler of Ardabil. According to the author's own note, this book was written with the request of his brother, Mohammad Shah Qajar, in 1835‚Äì1836. There is also a few poems left in the Persian language. According to some sources, Bahman Mirza had been the ruler of Persian Azerbaijan since 1842. He didn't stay in this post for a long time. His nephew Naser al-Din Shah Qajar was appointed to this post. In the meantime, Nasiraddin, the new ruler of Azerbaijan ordered the removal of eyes of Bahman Mirza. Having seen the situation, Bahman Mirza rushed to the Russian navigator and wanted shelter from him. The ambassador received him very well and allowed Bahman to live in Russia. On May 12, 1848, he arrived in Baku with the Lankaran ship. On May 15, he went to Shamakhi from Baku. Bahman Mirza, who was looking for a permanent place of residence, didn't stay here, came to Tiflis on May 20 to live. At that time, his work ended in the Iranian era, the era of Azerbaijan began. On May 28, his 7 wives and 19 children from these wives were brought to Nakhchivan, after which they were sent to Tiflis, to heads of the family. According to some reports, seeing him expatriate, his nephew, Naser al-Din Shah, understood his mistake, pardoned him, and asked him to return. But Bahman did not come back again. Bahman Mirza was unable to live in Tiflis for a long time and bought the property of Malikbekov, who moved from Shusha on October 4, 1851, and stayed there with his family and lived in this city. Though he lived in Shusha, he took an active part in the cultural events of Karabakh. He often came to Barda, one of the oldest cities in Azerbaijan. During his 24 years in Karabakh, he began to write his new novel \\"Shukurnamei Shahanshahi\\". In this work, he described the sequence of historical events of the period from Genghis Khan to the XIX century. The work was completed in 1871. Having seen the old age, the scientist built a mausoleum for himself in Barda, 1880, and ordered his sons to bury him in the mausoleum. He died on February 11, 1884. His sons buried him in the mausoleum that was 25 meters east from Imamzadeh. Bahman Mirza's had library of about 38,000 books. Currently, some of these books are kept in Tbilisi, and the rest are kept in libraries in Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Yerevan. Several books from his library are in the Institute of Manuscripts of the Azerbaijani Academy of Sciences. Manuscripts of Bahman Mirza's \\"Tazgireyi Mohammed - Shahi\\" and \\"Shukurnamei - Shahshanshah\\" are preserved there. Those books and manuscripts have been confirmed by Bahman Mirza's own seal and signature. At present, the villages of \\"Boyuk Qajar\\" and \\"Bala Qajar\\" in the Barda region are formed of his descendants. Later his sons served as high-ranking officers in the Russian army. His four generals and four colonel sons were in military service in Russia and Iran. His son, who died in the Russian-Japanese war in 1904, was buried next to his father, Bahman Mirza Qajar. In recent years, the mausoleum has been restored.

Life and family Born into a family of the Unitarian faith, his father Samuel Snr was the Coventry prison keeper for many years and his mother Jane was the daughter of Josiah Corrie Snr, a minister in Kenilworth. He attended the school of his uncle John Corrie FRS, who was long-time President of the Birmingham Philosophical Institution. Marrying Sir Francis Ronalds' youngest sister Maria in 1833, they had four children: Alexander, Hugh, John Corrie and Jane. In the 1855‚Äì1875 period, they resided at Battle in a substantial estate called Quarry Hill. Samuel died in London, and was buried in the family vault in Kenilworth. Railway solicitor Samuel had been articled to his uncle Josiah Corrie, a lawyer in Birmingham, and their partnership was appointed as solicitors to the proposed London and Birmingham Railway (L&BR;) in 1830. They also acted as solicitors to various lines that were planned to connect other communities with the new trunkline. One was the Birmingham and Derby Railway (B&DR;) to which Corrie & Carter was appointed in 1835. B&DR; joined with other companies in 1844 to form the Midland Railway, with Carter being one of the solicitors to the amalgamation bill (Corrie having died). Some sources suggest that Carter was instrumental in the decision to establish the Railway Clearing House in 1841, when he and his good friend Robert Stephenson advised the directors of L&BR; and B&DR;, two of the founding members, on its merits. Carter was also a solicitor to the bill enabling L&BR; to amalgamate with other companies to form the London & North Western Railway (L&NWR;) in 1846. By now he had opened a second office in London and he soon acquired a home near Hyde Park. He later purchased a property at Battle. L&NWR; and Midland Railway were quite commonly aligned in the years following and he was able to represent them jointly. This happened for example with the Worcester and Hereford Railway, where he spoke on behalf of both companies at shareholder meetings and served as solicitor to its parliamentary bills. The 1845‚Äì1846 parliamentary session saw the peak of Railway Mania and the beginnings of the Battle of the Gauges, in both of which Carter was much occupied. He and Isambard Kingdom Brunel apparently negotiated a territorial boundary in early 1846 between Brunel's Great Western Railway (GWR) and its affiliates on the broad gauge, and the standard gauge L&NWR; and Midland companies, but it was overturned. Thereafter, Carter fought the spread of the broad gauge in various contests in parliament and the courts. He and Stephenson cited the dangers of rival companies using the same infrastructure on different gauges, requiring GWR to build its own stations in Birmingham and elsewhere. Some of his last parliamentary contests enabled Midland to build its own routes into London to its new St Pancras station and to Scotland on its Settle-Carlisle Railway. Member of parliament Carter was a staunch Liberal in his politics and had participated in the Birmingham Political Union in the 1830s. In a by-election in March 1868, he was elected to parliament for Coventry, which triggered his retirement from railway business. His maiden speech in the house was in support of the proposed Irish Church Act to disestablish the (Anglican) Church of Ireland. He had only a very short parliamentary term however as he and his Liberal colleague Henry Jackson were defeated in the general election in November 1868. He lost again in 1874. Benefactor to Coventry Carter funded the building of the Coventry School of Art, laying the foundation stone in 1862. He also donated ¬£1,000 towards the Free Library. Publications Carter published several pamphlets in the 1870s illustrating to railway shareholders that the new Railway Commissioners had been given powers to reduce rates and tolls from the amounts permitted in the companies' acts of parliament, thereby jeopardising their investments. His warnings created little consternation at the time but there was uproar a decade later when these powers became more explicit in the 1886 Railway and Canal Traffic bill.

He attempts to deliver a letter to a well-known writer named Franz Weidel, only to discover that Weidel has killed himself in a hotel room. He takes Weidel's last manuscript and identity documents, which promise him safe harbor in Mexico. He attempts to flee to Marseille via train with his injured friend, Heinz, but Heinz dies en route. In Marseille, he brings news of Heinz's death to his deaf wife Melissa and son Driss, both of whom are residing in the city illegally. Georg befriends Driss. When Georg attempts to turn in Weidel's papers to the Mexican consul, he is mistaken for Weidel and impersonates him, and is given transit visas for himself and Weidel's wife, Marie. He learns that Marie had left Weidel, but wishes to reunite with him and has been waiting in Marseille so they can flee together. Driss has an asthma attack, and Georg fetches a doctor, Richard, to care for him. Georg meets the doctor's mistress, who he learns is Marie. Richard wishes to flee, but is consumed by guilt over abandoning Marie. However, when Georg offers her a transit visa, Richard goes ahead and tries to board a departing ship, but is forced to give up his spot for French soldiers. Georg and Marie develop a romantic relationship, and he wrestles with whether to tell her the truth about her husband, coming close to doing so, but being unable to do so because she so adamantly believes him to be alive. He learns that Melissa and Driss have fled, and witnesses the suicide of a fellow refugee he had known as an acquaintance. Georg and Marie hail a taxi for the harbor to board their ship, the Montreal, but Georg exits, claiming he has forgotten something. He goes to Richard and sells him his place on the ship. While recounting his story to a bartender, to whom he entrusts Weidel's manuscript, he sees a woman who looks like Marie, but she disappears. He goes to the port to confirm that she boarded, but is told that the Montreal hit a mine and sank with no survivors. He returns to the bar, where he waits for Marie as the French police start sweeping the city to purge it of refugees.

Her face may be based on that of Caterina Cornaro, who at that time headed a lively court full of artists and writers in Asolo. If this is correct, she may have commissioned it or it may have been commissioned by someone wishing to praise her. Witnessing the vision are Antony the Great to the left and Louis of Toulouse to the right - the Battuti ran a hospital for the poor and sick so Antony (often prayed to for cures) and Louis (who renounced all worldly honours, including the throne of France) are apt choices.

Early life  London-based men's wear designer Lou Dalton was born in Shropshire and grew up in Hodnet. She was inspired to become a fashion designer after seeing an episode of \\"This Is Your Life\\" starring Zandra Rhodes when she was 12 years old. She left school at age 16 in 1989 to start an apprenticeship at Pardie Clothing, a tailoring business in Market Drayton, where she worked as a bespoke menswear tailor making shooting garments. She returned to education in 1996 to study menswear at the Royal College of Art, where she became friends with womenswear designer Holly Fulton. She worked at Charlie Allen as a design assistant while studying for her Master of Arts at the RCA, graduating in 1998.  Career  After graduating from the Royal College of Art with a Master's degree in Fashion Menswear in 1998, she held design roles at Cruciani knitwear, Stone Island, Iceberg and Japanese brand United Arrows, until she launched her own brand in 2005. She is currently a teacher at the Royal College of Art in London on the Menswear and Accessory Design courses and shows her eponymous collections during London Fashion Week: Mens.  Collaborations  In 2015, Dalton created a short fashion film with Italian label Cerruti. Directed by Nick Leary, the black-and-white film was shot at the Lanificio Cerruti textile mill in Biella, Italy, and at Dalton‚Äôs studio in London. It depicts Nino Cerruti's work with wool, and illustrates the bonds between Nino Cerruti, the mill and Dalton. In January 2016 she collaborated with Jaeger on a men‚Äòs collection for autumn 2016. The collection was shown during the London Fashion Week: Men's shows and was inspired by items from Jaeger‚Äôs archives, including some that Ernest Shackleton wore for his famous 1914 Endurance Expedition to Antarctica. The partnership continued for a second spring 2017 collection in June 2016. She collaborated with British high street retailer River Island on a 13-piece menswear collection in 2016. In January 2016, Dalton collaborated with British knitwear brand John Smedley on a collection for fall 2016 that included a sweater featuring a topographical map that was promoted by Dalton's friend and actor Russell Tovey.

In 2012 he was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society. Research Jacques Neveu is one of the founders of the modern theory of probability. His research deals with Markov processes, Markov chains, Gaussian processes, martingales, ergodic theory, random trees (especially Galton-Watson processes and Galton-Watson trees), and Dirac measures, as well as applications of probability theory to statistics, computer science, combinatorics, and statistical physics. In 1986 he introduced the concept of arbre de Galton-Watson (Galton-Watson tree) within the framework of discrete random trees; within the mathematical formalism of Galton-Watson trees, the ' is named in his honor.

Galvin (August 7, 1894 - January 27, 1993) was a lawyer and Deputy Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus.  Personal life  Galvin was born in Pierceton, Indiana on August 7, 1894. He later settled in Hammond, Indiana after beginning his law career. During World War I, after serving as a Knights of Columbus secretary at Camp Greene in North Carolina, he joined the American Expeditionary Forces in July 1918, and returned a year later. Galvin married Mary Graziella Chevigny, who predeceased him in 1947, and together they had a daughter and two sons, Mary Anne, Timothy P., Jr., and Patrick Joseph. Both sons attended Notre Dame. He had a brother, Francis Joseph Galvin, Sr., with whom he had a law practice, another brother, Edward, and two sisters, Nell and Catherine.  Early career = Notre Dame = Galvin was a member of the Class of 1916 at the University of Notre Dame. As a student, he was an editor of the Notre Dame Dome and was on the debate team. In the 1930s, Galvin was president of the Notre Dame Alumni Association. Beginning in 1946, he served as a University lay trustee. = Career = Galvin began his law career in the office of the Daniel E. Celly in Valparaiso in September of 1916 before moving his practice to Hammond in 1923. There he was a partner in the firm of Tinkam and Galvin. He was a senior partner at the law firm of Galvin, Galvin and Leeney (established 1934) with his brother, Francis, and Edmond J. Leeney. Prior to this, he was a member of the firm of Tinkham & Galvin. As an attorney, Galvin was admitted to the Supreme Court of the United States bar on November 18, 1943. Galvin was a president of the Hammond Chamber of Commerce, a director of the Mercantile National Bank of Hammond, and of the Citizens Federal Savings and Loan Association of Hammond.  Later career = Knights of Columbus = He joined the Knights when he turned 18, and became grand knight of Valparaiso Council before becoming a district deputy in the area. Galvin was state deputy of Indiana from 1925 to 1928. Galvin was first elected to the Supreme Board in 1933 and served as Supreme Master of the Fourth Degree of the Knights from 1941 to 1945. In 1945 he was elected Deputy Supreme Knight and resigned from that post and from the Board of Directors in 1949. Galvin was elected Deputy Supreme Knight during a power struggle for control of the Order between his close personal friend and future Supreme Knight, Luke E. Hart, and the then-Supreme Knight, Francis P. Matthews. Over several years, Supreme Advocate Hart had orchestrated the election of directors who had a different vision for the future of the Order than Matthews. Matthews opposed having a convention in 1945 to preserve hotel space for returning WWII soldiers, but a convention was called anyway in the expectation that something could be worked out. The convention assembled in Montreal but, upon determining that a convention there would not be feasible, they adjourned to Plattsburgh, New York. Matthews felt such an action was illegal, declared himself not a candidate, and Hart's slate of officers were all elected, including Galvin and Supreme Knight John E. Swift. In recognition of his service to the church, he was made a Knight of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great, one of the five Orders of Knighthood of the Holy See, by Pope Pius XII in 1942. The Timothy P. Galvin K.S.G. Outstanding Catholic Layman Award is awarded each year by the Indiana State Council in his honor. As Deputy Supreme Knight during World War II, he argued that the United States was \\"fighting to uphold the doctrine at all men are created equal in the sight of God.\\"  Volunteer work  Galvin also served on the board of the Gibault School for Boys, an institution established by the Indiana Knights, for several decades, and as a trustee of Our Sunday Visitor. He was also on the Lay Advisory Board of St. Joseph‚Äôs College, Calumet Center, and served as a Trustee of All Saints Parish, Hammond. Galvin was the first commander of the Charles Pratt Post of the American Legion in Valparaiso. During the Second World War, Galvin was a member of Lake County's Selective Service Board No. 4. He also was a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks was active with the American Legion. In 1957, B'nai B'rith of Hammond honored Galvin as the outstanding citizen of that city.

Career After making his professional debut in 1926, Huat had some notable wins in his first three years as a pro, beating Maurice Huguenin in January 1927 and November 1928, Rene Chalange in April 1927 and February 1929, Praxille Gyd√© in November 1927, Kid Oliva in December 1928, and Ernie Jarvis in January 1929. In June 1929 he beat √âmile Pladner on points at the Cirque de Paris to win the French and European flyweight titles. Towards the end of the year he travelled to the United States to take part in a tournament to content the vacant NYSAC world flyweight title; Huat beat Corporal Izzy Schwartz,\\"Eugene Huat Uncovers Real Wallop in Beating Izzy Schwartz\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, 5 November 1929, p. 24. Retrieved 6 February 2018 before losing to Eladio \\"Black Bill\\" Vald√©s in the semi-final. While in the US, Huat moved up to bantamweight, losing his first fight at the weight to Archie Bell. Huat beat Nicolas Petit-Biquet in April 1930, and Pladner in May, and in October faced Panama Al Brown in Paris for the IBU world bantamweight title, losing on points.Roberts, James B. (2006) The Boxing Register, McBooks Press, , p. 79 In July 1931, Huat challenged for Pete Sanstol's Canadian Boxing Federation & Montreal Athletic Commission-recognised world bantamweight title in Montreal, again losing on points. While still in Montreal, he lost to Newsboy Brown in September 1931, but won a return fight a month later. Three weeks after the second fight, Huat challenged Brown again, with the National Boxing Association world title at stake. Huat again lost on points. Back in France, Huon put together six straight wins, including victories over Francois Biron, Lucian Popescu, and Len Beynon, before losses to Kid Francis and Panama Al Brown. Later in 1932, Huat travelled again to North America for a largely unsuccessful series of fights. Huat won the French bantamweight title in August 1933 with a points win over Eugene Lorenzoni, losing it in his first defence to Joseph Decico in March 1934, also losing a rematch three months later. Despite poor results in the preceding two years, Huat got a fourth world title shot in August 1934 when he challenged for Sixto Escobar's Montreal Athletic Commission title in Montreal. Escobar took a unanimous points verdict. In January 1935 Huat challenged Pladner for the French title, Pladner stopping him in the seventh round. Over the next three years, Huat continued to fight quality opponents, with wins over Gaston Maton, Young Perez, and Georges Bataille, but also suffered losses to Perez, Peter Kane, and Little Pancho. Huat was out of the ring for almost three years from June 1938 before making a return in May 1941. He continued to fight until 1942, his penultimate fight a defeat at the hands of Valentin Angelmann. He finished with a record of 80 wins, 44 defeats, and 9 draws. After retiring from the ring, Huat went into management, working with boxers such as Pierre Montane, Tony Toniolo, Pierre Langlois, and Jean Jouas.\\"Eugene Huat Hard Taskmaster\\", Sporting Globe, 26 January 1949, p. 12.

England's first competition organized by a national body, the FA Cup, began in the 1871‚Äì72 season, making it one of the oldest football competitions in the world. Arsenal hold the record number of wins, 13. League football began in the next decade with the founding of The Football League in 1888‚Äì89. The name First Division was adopted in 1892, when The Football League gained a second division. The First Division remained the highest division of the English football league system until 1992, when the Premier League was founded. Manchester United have won the most top division titles, with 20. The English equivalent of the super cup began in 1898 with the inauguration of the Sheriff of London Charity Shield, pitting the best professional and amateur sides of the year against each other. The trophy would develop into the FA Charity Shield in 1908, which was later renamed the FA Community Shield in 2002. The Football League created its own knockout competition in 1960, the League Cup. The Anglo-Italian League Cup was created in 1969 to match English cup winners against the winners of the Coppa Italia, and was permanently disbanded in 1976. In 1985, the Full Members Cup and Football League Super Cup were created as substitutes for UEFA competitions after UEFA responded to the Heysel Stadium disaster by banning English clubs. They finished in 1986 and 1992 respectively. The Football League Centenary Trophy marked The Football League's 100th birthday, in the 1988‚Äì89 season. In the history of English football various subordinate competitions have also been organized, for those clubs ineligible for higher competitions. By 1893, professional teams had come to dominate the FA Cup, so The FA created the FA Amateur Cup for the 1893‚Äì94 season. This competition was discontinued in 1974, with the abolition of official amateur status and the creation of its partial successor the FA Vase. Sunday league football clubs play in the FA Sunday Cup, begun in 1964. The FA Trophy commenced in 1969 for those participants in Steps 1‚Äì4 of the National League System (tiers 5‚Äì8 of the overall English football league system). The Watney Cup, active from 1970 until 1973 was one of the first of these to have top division participants, though only for clubs that didn't qualify for UEFA competitions. The Anglo- Italian Cups, also begun in 1970, ran on and off in various formats until 1996. A third competition begun in 1970 was the Texaco Cup. It had entirely top division participants apart from the final season, and was one of the few competitions featuring clubs from different nations of the United Kingdom and Ireland, however, it only admitted clubs that didn't qualify for UEFA competitions. It shrunk in 1976 to become the Anglo-Scottish Cup, and shrunk again in 1981 to become the Football League Group Cup. In 1983, this was replaced by the Associate Members Cup, which featured clubs from League One, League Two. In 1992, when lower division clubs became full members of the Football League, the Associate Members Cup took the name Football League Trophy, before being renamed again in 2016 as the EFL Trophy. Since the 2016‚Äì17 season, sixteen Clubs with Category One academies from Championship and Premier League have taken part in the competition. The first clubs to receive an invitation will be the sixteen clubs that will be participating in the Premier League in the current season and which operate a Category One Academy and the order of priority will be based on first team finishing position in the immediately preceding season (across both the Premier League and Championship Division of the League).

Early life and family Then Thomas was the second son of Rees Goring and Sarah Goring (n√©e Sarah Hovel). He studied at Tooting School in Cheam, Surrey, and then went on to study at Trinity College, Cambridge where he graduated with a BA in 1824, and an MA in 1827. He was then called to the Bar at Inner Temple in 1827. He married Louisa Frances Dalrymple, only child of John Apsley Dalrymple, in 1835, but they had issue. On 11 November 1856, he eschewed the surname 'Thomas', replacing it by deed poll with the old family of 'Treherne'. Political career Treherne stood multiple times for parliament during his life ‚Äì in 1832, 1833, 1835, 1837, 1857, and 1859 ‚Äì contesting Coventry each time. He was eventually elected for the seat at a by-election in 1863 and held the seat until his death in 1867.

Mariolina Olivari, Giovanni Bellini, in AA.VV., Pittori del Rinascimento, Scala, Firenze 2007. It is his earliest surviving portrait and one of the first works in oil (rather than tempera) by an Italian artist. It can be securely dated due to an inscription on its reverse (removed during an early 20th century restoration) reading \\"Jeorg Fugger a di XX di Zugno MCCCCLXXIIII\\" (\\"Georg Fugger on 20th June 1474\\"). He was the head of the Nuremberg branch of the German Fugger bank, which was heavily involved in the Fondaco dei Tedeschi in Venice. He wears a garland and his individual features are shown in detail, although the work lacks the psychological elements introduced to Venice in 1475 by Antonello da Messina. A copy after the work is in a private collection in Milan. It was recorded in the collection of Johannes, Count of Fugger-Oberkirchberg at Schloss Oberkirchberg in Ulm. It was sold by Walter Schnackenberg on 10 December 1926 to the art dealer Franz Kleinberger and Co., who sold it on to count Alessandro Contini-Bonacossi for $40,000 on 17 May 1928. It passed to his heirs and finally passed from Lorenzo Papi of Florence to its present owner in 1969.

Originally built as a family cemetery by Nathan Newlin in 1812, the cemetery was renamed Dravo Cemetery after being acquired by Reverend Dravo who built the Dravo Methodist Church on the property in 1824. The church burned down twice and the property was eventually abandoned. The cemetery has been maintained by the Elizabeth Township Historical Society since 1986. Overview The cemetery contains 708 graves dating back to 1812. Only 81 of the graves are identified. Among the graves are many graves of children, demonstrating the effect that childhood disease had on the community. Ten war veterans are buried here: 9 veterans of the Civil War and 1 veteran of the War of 1812. History The cemetery was first built by European immigrant Nathan Newlon in 1812. Newlon worked as a farmer in the land west of the Youghiogheny River. Newlon eventually earned enough money to buy additional land along the river, and converted part of the land he acquired into a cemetery for the members of his family who had died. Newlon himself was buried in the cemetery after his death in 1820. Reverend William Dravo then purchased the land to build a larger church for the local community. His church, called the Dravo Methodist Church, was built in 1824, and took ownership of the cemetery on the property. Around the turn of the century, the church burned down for reasons that were unclear at the time. The church was rebuilt and services resumed. In 1924 the church burned down again, this time under suspicion of arson. The police investigation determined that the church had been set on fire by sparks from the nearby train tracks. Due to the discovery, the church was abandoned for fear of burning down again and parishioners attended different nearby churches. A newspaper article in 2001 about the cemetery generated new interest, and caused more local residents to visit the cemetery.

Early life Dora Lynnell Wilson was born on 31 August 1883 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Her parents were James Wilson, agent, and Annie Maria, n√©e Green. The family emigrated to the state of Victoria in Australia in 1884, when Dora was a year old. Education Wilson was educated at Somerset School and Methodist Ladies' College in Melbourne. From 1901-1906 she studied at the National Gallery under Bernard Hall and Frederick McCubbin, forming friendships with fellow artists Ruth Hollick, Gwendolyn Grant, , and her partner Pegg Clarke. She also took lessons from John Mather with Jessie Traill and Janie Wilkinson Whyte. Artistic career Wilson was best known for her etchings, pastels and oils of still lifes and nudes. Her work was praised for her 'strong sense of colour' but also critiqued for demonstrating a 'chocolate box prettiness'. Her work was included in a number of notable exhibitions, including the Australian Exhibition of Women's Work in Melbourne, a Royal Academy exhibition of Australian art in London. In 1923 her work, 'Reve d'Or', was reproduced on the cover of Women's World and exhibited at the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais in Paris. Her studio at Collins Street West was the meeting place of ex-Gallery School students who exhibited in 1913-14 as 'The Twelve Melbourne Painters.' This group included Jessie Traill, Janet Cumbrae Stewart, Norah Gurdon, Penleigh Boyd, and Lindsay Bernard Hall. Wilson was also a member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. From the 1920s onwards she concentrated largely on street scenes, and in 1923 she was commissioned by Sir Baldwin Spencer to undertake a series of paintings of European landmarks, which saw her travelling around Europe for over two years, accompanied by the photographer Pegg Clarke. In 1928 these works were exhibited at the Beaux Arts Gallery, London, and the following year at Australia House. In the early 1930s she focused on historical scenes from Melbourne's history, with an exhibition entitltled 'Milestones of Melbourne' held at the Fine Art Society Gallery in March 1935. Her work was received favorably by Arthur Streeton for being \\"fresh in colour and treatment and free from the depressing appearance of black paint.\\" File:Dora L Wilson - Exterior view of single story house with steep gabled roof.jpgExterior view of single story house with steep gabled roof, [between 1900 and 1910] File:Dora Wilson - Unidentified light house on a cliff.jpgUnidentified light house on a cliff', [between 1900 and 1910]'' File:Dora Wilson - Ships at anchor.jpgShips at anchor', [between 1900 and 1910]'' Death Wilson died of cancer on 21 November 1946 and was cremated at Springvale Cemetery, Melbourne.

The novel tells the story of Ella Wallis, an abused 14-year-old girl living in Bristol, England, who develops telekinesis, levitation, and other psychic powers and achieves fame while at the midst of a power struggle between adults who want to control her. Background The book's themes marked a change for Geller, moving his focus away from illusions such as spoon bending and onto the power of prayer. As part of his research for the novel, Geller spent two days at Saint Catherine's Monastery, at the foot of Mount Sinai. Geller said in an interview with Heise Online that he gave powers to Ella that he did have, but always wanted, and noted that a lot of the plot within the book that covered poor public relations stunts and bad press was inspired by the reactions he himself had received over the years, as was the criticism made by the book of skepticism. He expressed his hope to The Times that Ella would be made into a movie, but as yet this has not been the case. The Guardian suggested parallels between Ella's and Geller's lives, with the darkness in Geller's life being reflected in much of the plot of the book. Plot The story concerns a fourteen-year-old girl named Ella Wallis, who lives in Bristol with her parents. She is bullied at school due to her family's poverty, and is abused at home, both physically by her fundamentalist Christian father, and sexually by his brother, Ella's uncle. Her French mother is an alcoholic. The stress and upset in her life result in Ella developing bulimia, and subsequently paranormal powers, beginning with pyrokinesis, when she sets a Nativity scene alight at school. She then develops telekinesis in a response to her uncle trying to exorcise her, moving books with her mind. As Ella's abilities become more widely-known, a series of people try to exploit her, including Icelandic psychic researcher Peter Guntarson, Spanish public relations specialist Jos√© Miguel D√≥la, and her own family, who realise the money-earning potential of Ella's abilities. Over time Ella develops further powers, including levitation, teleportation, remote viewing, and psychic healing. She gets ever thinner, from the ongoing impact of her eating disorder, and eventually appears to die live on television, with her final act being to heal the sickness of everyone in the world, with something known as the \\"Ella Effect\\". The book hints that she was actually transformed into an angel. Reception Publishers Weekly described the book as an \\"acerbic portrait of the sensationalist media, [which] adds a new twist to this predictable but engaging tale\\". In a highly critical review, The Jerusalem Post said that \\"There is not a single redeeming feature in any one of the ugly, unpleasant, and indeed revolting characters in this book\\", and that \\"as a thriller writer, Geller is a flop.\\" 10 years later, in 2008, Geller was still upset by the Post's review, and blamed it on the \\"intelligentsia\\" not accepting him.

Early life William Kent was born in 1884, the youngest son of Richard Kent, the Wesleyan owner of Kent and Matthews, a printing firm, in Lambeth. He was raised in Tradescant Road, Lambeth, south London, and attended the Wheatsheaf Hall where he taught Sunday school and was highly involved in young Methodist activities. He also watched a great deal of cricket at the nearby Oval and later wrote a book on the sport. Later his family moved to Norbury, where his father ran a stationery business. He lost his religious faith in his early adulthood some time after reading the work of Thomas Huxley on agnosticism. Career Kent wrote many works on the history of London, notably his very successful Encyclopaedia of London, first published in 1937, and London Worthies, 1939. His memoirs were published in 1938 as The Testament of a Victorian Youth. His study of John Burns, whom his father had known as a boy, is his most important other work, offering a critical but witty and not unsympathetic picture of the former labour leader and cabinet minister, whom Kent often visited in the last years of Burns's life. At this time he was living in Union Road, Clapham. He was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, elected by ballot on 5th February 1948. Death and legacy Kent died on 9 May 1963 at Tooting Bec Hospital, London. His home at the time of his death was 76 Brodrick Road, London SW17.

Rhea is a regular performer on Chinese music and entertainment programs, having made appearances on China Central Television, China Education Television, Jiangsu TV, Beijing TV, Inner Mongolia TV, Yunnan TV, Anhui TV, as well as other local and provincial stations across China. Rhea performs in Chinese (primarily Mandarin, but also in Shaanxi dialect), Mongolian, and English. While he rose to prominence in China for singing traditional Chinese folk tunes, he also writes and sings Chinese pop and educational music and performs a variety of English-language material including American jazz standards and rock-and-roll. Rhea has been referred to in Chinese and international media as a cultural ambassador and \\"musical diplomat\\" because of his background in international relations and dream to improve U.S.-China relations through his music and performances. Rhea additionally credits former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, whom he met and sang for in 2016, as an inspiration to pursue a career in cultural diplomacy. Rhea lives in Beijing and, in addition to his entertainment career, holds a position as lecturer in English and International Studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University. Childhood and education Rhea was born and raised in Alexandria, Louisiana, where he was first singled out to sing solos in his Catholic church choir and learned piano and violin in local music programs. He was enrolled in the Boy Scouts of America from grade one and earned the rank of Eagle Scout at age 13. He graduated from the Louisiana School for Math, Science and the Arts in Natchitoches, Louisiana before attending the University of Oklahoma as a National Merit Scholar, where he earned dual bachelor's degrees in Chinese Language and Literature and Asian Studies. He attended the Johns Hopkins University-Nanjing University Center for Chinese and American Studies in Nanjing, China, where he studied, wrote and defended a 100-page thesis in Mandarin and earned dual master's degrees in China Studies and International Politics from Johns Hopkins University and Nanjing University while first performing on Nanjing-based Jiangsu TV. Connection to Xi'an, Shaanxi folk songs, and biangbiang noodles Rhea writes and explains a \\"biang\\" character on Xi'an TV. Rhea has a close connection with the ancient Chinese capital of Xi'an (and Shaanxi Province) and its culture, having first visited the city and established connections there in 2010. Rhea often sings North Shaanxi folk songs, which he first heard and fell in love with on his first visit to China. His connection to Xi'an and Shaanxi Province is often discussed in his TV appearances, including his love of Shaanxi's distinctive cuisine, including roujiamo (\\"Chinese hamburger\\"), liangpi (cold noodles), yangrou paomo (lamb stew with bits of crumbled flatbread), fried persimmon cakes, and, most prominently, biangbiang noodles (Shaanxi's famous 'thick-as-a-belt' handmade noodles). The \\"biang\\" in biangbiang noodles is known for being one of the most complex Chinese characters; and Rhea made front-page news in Shaanxi province's Chinese Business View when he first wrote the character on CCTV. Show hosts and guests often \\"test\\" Rhea's ability to write it, and as a result, Rhea has since been associated with the character in Chinese media. For instance, CCTV host Zhu Jun demonstrated to him how Shaanxi people crouch down to eat the noodles (a folk custom in Shaanxi); in other cases, Rhea has taught other TV personalities, for instance Hong Kong singer Leo Ku, to write the character while reciting a mnemonic poem for remembering the character's 43 strokes.

The OPSA team operate on facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate.  Foundation  OPSA was founded in 1998 by Nick Hart who, after travelling to Pakistan with a surgical team to carry out facial operations on young children, returned to Hull in Northern England to set up OPSA. Starting out in a small local hospital in Gujrat, a purpose built hospital, called The Cleft Hospital, was soon built to meet the growing demand. OPSA have worked out of The Cleft Hospital ever since.  Activities  The OPSA team travel from the UK, Ireland and Turkey twice a year to operate and teach at The Cleft hospital in Gujrat. The yearly trips to Pakistan were increased to twice annually in 2008. Working with medical teams in Gujrat, including Dr Ijaz Bashir, OPSA teach and train local doctors to carry out some of the work year round. Patients travel from all over Pakistan in the hope of receiving advice and treatment from the specialist UK surgical team.  Facts & Figures  Cleft palate occurs in around 1 to 2 of every 1000 births around the world. In Pakistan, up to 10,000 babies are born each year with cleft conditions, with the majority not being able to afford to pay for operations. As of the end of 2017, the OPSA team have operated on more than 3000 patients. Approximately 100 to 150 patients receive surgery at each OPSA camp, which last for 7 days.  Medical Team  Nick Hart is a British doctor and plastic surgeon and the founder of OPSA. Hart was the dedicated cleft lip and palate surgeon for the Hull & East Yorkshire region until 2000, when the service was moved to Leeds. Hart led all of the surgical teams to Pakistan for OPSA, but in 2015 retired from surgery, staying on as the charity's chairman. Penelope McManus is consultant oncoplastic breast surgeon based at the East Riding Hospital in East Yorkshire. McManus joined OPSA surgical team in 2013 to aid with the diagnosis and care of breast cancer patients. Pakistan has a high rate of breast cancer and few specialist services to care for patients. Dr Bashir installed a mammography machine at The Cleft Hospital so that Dr McManus can treat patients as well as train local doctors and nurses. Annette Middleton is a Yorkshire-based theatre nurse who first travelled to Pakistan with OPSA in 1999. Middleton still annually attends the camps in Gujarat, Pakistan to aid with teaching and operations. Chris Hill is an Consultant Plastic & Reconstructive Surgeon based in Northern Ireland who has been volunteering for OPSA since early 2015. He is the only cleft lip and palate surgeon in Northern Ireland, and carries out 250 operations a year at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children. Like the rest of the OPSA team, Hill gives up his free time to travel to Pakistan to operate and teach. Dr Zahid Rafique is a consultant anaesthetist at Hull & East Yorkshire NHS Trusts. Dr Rafique has been travelling to Pakistan with the OPSA team for 12 years and is in charge of procuring all medical supplies and equipment for the camps.  Ambassadors  Ambassadors for the charity include England & Yorkshire cricketer Adil Rashid, BBC journalist Kate Adie CBE, actresses Stephanie Cole and Debra Stephenson.

Pieter Bladelin (born Pieter de Leestemakere in or before 1408, Bruges - 8 April 1472) was an important financial advisor and civil servant to the Burgundian State. He was lord of Middelburg and built the Hof Bladelin in Bruges. Life=Early life= He was the son of the crane- operator Pieter de Leestemakere (died 1433) and Elizabeth Hugheleins (died before 1418). His father worked as a crane-operator in Bruges, although the family was from Veurne. In 1430 Bladelin was recorded as the eleventh member of Bruges' city council and four years later he had risen to its fifth member. In or around 1435 he married Margaretha van de Vagheviere (1414, Bruges - 5 May 1476, Middelburg), daughter of Jan van de Vagheviere and Margareta de Vrient - the marriage proved childless. He built Hof Bladelin on Naaldenstraat in Bruges from 1435 onwards. From 1436 to 1438 he was Bruges' city treasurer, but in 1436 he also acted as an intermediary between the city and Philip the Good after it revolted against the Duke. In 1438, towards the end of the revolt, he was granted gros briefs by the Duke and on 1 January 1441 he was recorded as his general recipient of finance. In 1444 he is recorded as the duchy's treasurer and governor of finance - he was now also on the Grote Raad as a financial advisor. In 1447 he was named the next treasurer of the Order of the Golden Fleece and took on the role four years later on the death of its previous holder, Guy de Guilbert. =Burgundy= Portrait of Bladelin on the altarpiece by van der Weiden The Duke often appointed him as a commissioner to chair committees on legal reform in the cities. He also maintained his diplomatic skills, mediating between the Duke and Ghent when it rebelled in 1452-1453 and between Bruges and Brugse Vrije. He was also sent to England and France on diplomatic business and became a major patron of the arts. His sister Margareta (died 1449) was married to Colaard de Fever, who was from a family of wealthy money changers and royal officials and who bought properties and lands belonging to Middelburg Abbey in 1433, in an economically-important area on the road between Bruges and Aardenburg. Bladelin bought these from Colaard in 1440 and also expanded them by buying adjacent plots. In 1444 Philip the Good promoted Bladelin's lands into a lordship and Bladelin built a castle, which became his summer residence from 1450 onwards and appeared in the background of the 1460 triptych he commissioned from Rogier van der Weyden. He also began construction on the new town of Middelburg in 1452, which was largely completed by 1465. He built it a collegiate church, dedicated in 1460, to which he donated a relic of the True Cross he had obtained from Wouter Utenhove, hoping to turn the church into a pilgrimage site. He also built the town a monastery, guesthouse, rampart and drainage canal to the and in 1458 was authorised to appoint a town council of seven aldermen and a mayor, followed by permission to hold a free annual market seven years later. He even hosted Charles the Bold, Margaret of York and Mary of Burgundy in the town for a few weeks in June 1470. =Death= He was usually entitled a 'high and mighty lord', a title used only by members of the high nobility, but his lack of children meant he had nobody to pass his lordship onto. He was buried in front of the high altar in the church he had built in Middelburg, joined a few years later by his widow, who had been allowed to continue ruling the lordship by Charles the Bold. On her death Bladelin's will of 13 March 1472 came into effect, passing the estates in Middelburg to the descendants of Margareta and Colaard. Margareta had two daughters, Margaretha, who was married to Jan III de Baenst, and Elisabeth, who was married to Joos I van Varsenare. Joos I's son Joos II and Jan III could not agree how to divide the property and took the dispute to law. However, the dispute became so desperate that immediately after the death of Margareta the elder they agreed to sell Middelburg to William Hugonet, chancellor of Burgundy. Nothing remains of the town of Middelburg except the church, which contains a copy of the van der Weiden altarpiece by Jan Ryckx - the original is now in the Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin. Baron Philippe de Merode later gave the church's relic to Albert VII, Archduke of Austria and his wife Isabella, who thanked him by making him Count of Middelburg. Isabella left it in her will to St Gudula, Brussels, which eventually sent a tiny sliver back to Middelburg. Hof Bladelin in Bruges was sold to the Florentine Medici family, who set up a branch there under the management of Tommaso Portinari and put in medallions showing family busts. Bibliography * K.

He attended Rugby School and then Brasenose College, Oxford. Mainwaring married Anna Maria Salusbury, the eldest daughter of Colonel John Lloyd Salusbury of Galltfaenan Hall, in February 1837, at which time Mainwaring was living at Marchwiel Hall. The couple went on to have two sons ‚Äì Charles Salusbury Mainwaring and Reginald Kynaston Mainwaring ‚Äì and two daughters. Political career Mainwaring became a magistrate in December 1837. Subsequently, he became the first of his family to be elected MP since George Mainwaring (1642-1695). Described as a Liberal Conservative and a Peelite, he was first elected for Denbigh Boroughs in 1841 but stood down at the 1847 election.

Much of this research involves the model organism C. reinhardtii, an important organism in biofuel research due to its tendency to accumulate triacylglycerols. The Hicks Lab has studied the phosphoproteome of C. reinhardtii in order to examine underlying biological processes. Work has also been done to understand cell regulatory pathways, especially the algal analog of the mammalian TOR pathway. To a similar end, Dr. Hicks' group has extended its work to examine how the reversible oxidation of thiols plays a role in signaling and effector-triggered immunity. The increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance has produced a need for novel antimicrobial agents. The Hicks Lab has investigated antimicrobial peptides as a potential source for new antibiotics. Recent work has involved the development of a comprehensive analytical approach using LC-MS for the identification of novel antimicrobial peptides from botanical, fungal, and bacterial sources.

His research interests are focused on electrochemistry, molecular designs, and sensors. He has over 440 publications in analytical, physical, inorganic, and materials chemistry, and has trained 72 Ph.D students, 16 master‚Äôs students, and 58 postdoctoral fellows, 45 of whom have gone on to university faculty positions. He was named a fellow of the American Chemical Society in 2012, and holds three patents related to surface-modified electrodes. *  Biography  Royce W. Murray grew up in Birmingham, Alabama on January 9, 1937. He worked at the electrical shop run by his father, who was an electrician for the Alabama Power Company. Here he became familiar with electrical meters, generators, lathes, wiring diagrams, and insulating materials, as well as scrap metal from the War, 50-call ammo, and gunpowder, foreshadowing his career in electrochemistry. Murray graduated from Birmingham Southern College with a focus in chemistry, having switched from the pre-ministerial program. He then attended graduate school at Northwestern University, where he worked with Richard Bowers and Don DeFord, and began tinkering with chronoamperometry and chronopotentiometry. After graduating from Northwestern in three years, Murray became an instructor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Murray was promoted from Instructor to Assistant Professor in 1961, and Associate Professor in 1966. At roughly the same time as his promotion to Full Professor (1969), he was made an Alfred P. Sloan Fellow. In 1980, he was named a Kenan Professor of Chemistry and, in 1996, a Kenan Professor of Applied and Materials Sciences.  Contributions  In 1967, Murray was made Building Committee Chair for construction of the new Kenan Laboratories of Chemistry. This initial service role led him to the position of Acting Chair and Vice Chair of the UNC Chemistry Department in the early 1970s, Director of Undergraduate Studies, and then on to Chair of the Department in the early 1980s. His service to UNC then expanded beyond the boundaries of the Department, as witnessed by his roles as Chair, Division of Basic and Applied Natural Sciences; Chair, Curriculum in Applied and Materials Sciences; and Vice Chair, Division of Basic and Applied Natural Sciences. He was also the Chair, Task Force for Planning the Science Complex at UNC, a role that is quite similar in nature to his role in 1967 with the Kenan buildings. Murray's service positions have included roles as the National Science Foundation‚Äôs first ‚Äúrotator‚Äù in the Chemistry Division in the early 1970s and a key participant in subsequent NSF activities, and with the American Chemical Society in roles relating to the Subcommittee on Graduate Level Analytical Chemistry Examination, Division of Chemical Education (1964‚Äì74, Chair, 1970‚Äì74); Division of Analytical Chemistry, Alternate Councilor (1978‚Äì79), Councilor (1980‚Äì82); Canvassing Committee, ACS National Awards (1984‚Äì86); Advisory Board, Analytical Chemistry (1979- 1981); Division of Analytical Chemistry (1985-1989); Committee on Publications (1985‚Äì90); and Executive Committee, Division of Analytical Chemistry (1991‚Äìpresent). He was also the Editor-in-Chief of Analytical Chemistry from 1991 to 2011. He received The Thomas Jefferson Award at the University of North Carolina in 2001, and the state of North Carolina presented Royce with the North Carolina Award in Science in November 2001.

She was launched in 1882 in Cleveland, Ohio as hull number #4, and sank on September 14, 1915 in Lake Superior near Knife River, Minnesota. Onoko is thought to be the prototype for every single steel hulled Great Lakes Bulk carrier that ever sailed. These vessels made possible the cheap transport of bulk cargoes such as iron ore, coal and limestone. Her wreckage still remains on the bottom of Lake Superior and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. History=Construction= The plans for Onoko Onoko (Official number 155048) was built at Radcliffe's yard in Cleveland by the Globe Iron Works Company and was launched on February 16, 1882. She had a length of 302.6-feet, a beam of 38.6 feet and a height of 24.8-feet. She was powered by a 900-horsepower compound steam engine and fueled by two Scotch marine boilers She was commissioned by Phillip Minch of Vermillion, Ohio for the Minch Transportation Company of the Kinsman Steamship Company and a syndicate of other investors. The ship was built to take advantage of the channels opened in 1881 when the new Weitzel Lock was built at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. The superintendent of Onoko construction was John H. Smith, who learned iron shipbuilding technology and techniques on the River Clyde in Scotland. Smith worked for the newly founded Globe Shipbuilding Company of Cleveland, Ohio, successors to an old and respected boiler and engine building company. On February 16, 1882 the day Onoko was scheduled to be launched, about five thousand people came to watch the launching despite the rough weather conditions. With all the preparations completed Smith gave the launch signal at 3 p.m.. The ropes that were tied to Onoko were cut at each end enabling her to slide into the water. During the next few months Onoko was outfitted and rigged. Although most of the vessel's machinery had been fitted before her launching, her masts at least were installed later. This was done by the Messrs, Upson, Walton & Company. =Service history= On her maiden voyage Onoko sailed from Cleveland on April 19, 1882 leaving port at 11 p.m. and arriving in Chicago around 2 p.m. the next day. She was carrying 2,536 tons of coal. Onoko captain, W.H. Pringle, said that Onoko \\"behaved splendidly and steered like a yacht\\". By April 25, Onoko had been loaded with a cargo of wheat bound for Buffalo, New York and left at 3:30 p.m. She discharged 88,140 bushels of wheat at the Niagara B Elevator. Not a bit of the cargo was wet. It was thought that Onoko could carry 115,000 to 120,000 bushels of wheat. Onoko capacity to carry oats was believed to be at around 155,000 bushels. The Buffalo Courier provides an accurate account of when Onoko arrived in Buffalo. It said that \\"About noon on Saturday the new iron steamer Onoko arrived here with something over 88,000 bushels wheat. She left Chicago last Tuesday at 4:20PM and her time in coming down was three days and nineteen and a half hours\\". On May 2, 1882 the writers of the Buffalo Courier wrote a rather unpleasant report about the looks of Onoko: > The Onoko is the largest vessel afloat on the lakes - and by far the > homeliest. She looks very like a huge canal boat with a smokestack and four > sticks. Her model is really frightful; her upper works are without decent > shape, and to cap all her painting is but a daub. For a new vessel she is > the worst looking sight that ever appeared on our inland waters. She could > have been given a respectable appearance without much interfering with her > carrying qualities. One of these days we will show those Cleveland fellows > an iron steamer that will be worth looking at. The Onoko is an eye-sore. The Buffalo Courier criticizing the appearance of Onoko didn't go down with her owners. On May 5, 1882 the Cleveland Herald responded to the accusations with this reply: > The Buffalo papers took occasion when the steamship Onoko was there a few > days ago to speak disparagingly of her qualities, especially her homeliness, > and wound up by calling her an \\"eye-sore.\\" This is ridiculous, in view of > late developments. A Buffalo party has been in this city the past few days > negotiating with the owners of the Onoko with a view to her purchase. He was > anxious to secure her, \\"eye-sore\\" and all, at a price considerably above the > cost of building. There was a disposition on the part of some of her owners > to accept his terms, but the others would not part with their interest, and > the arrangement fell through. The owners are well satisfied with the way the > boat works. Onoko had proved herself to be a success in her first two years of carrying bulk cargoes on the Great Lakes. On August 22, 1884 the Cleveland Herald reported that Onoko had \\"proved even more successful than her owners hoped for\\". Onoko underway circa 1910 In 1895 two of Onoko mast were removed, her wooded forecastle was replaced with a steel deck and steel pilothouse structure. In 1896 she had her boilers replaced with two 12 x 12.5 foot Scotch marine boilers. On May 16, 1896 Onoko collided with the schooner Mary D. Ayer in heavy fog on Lake Michigan. Five sailors on Mary D. Ayer died. Onokos wooden spar deck was replaced with steel in 1901. Later that year the principal owners of Onoko, the Nicholas Transportation Company, bought out all the lesser stockholders to become sole owner of Onoko. Onoko had steel aft cabins installed in 1907 through 1908. In 1910, Captain Harry Stewart was appointed as the master of Onoko. On the night of December 1, 1910 Onoko ran aground on Southeast Shoal during a snow storm 60 miles below Amherstburg, between Point Pelee and Wheatley, Ontario. She was released with three tugs, including Harding and Rescue were sent to rescue Onoko. She was carrying coal at the time. On December 2, 1910 the Duluth Herald wrote an article saying Onoko was not in any serious danger. The tugs succeeded in refloating her without serious damage to her hull. On October 7, 1912 Onoko sprang a leak and was intentionally beached in the Apostle Islands. The cost to patch her hull was minimal. Final voyage In early September, 1915, Onoko grounded while departing a grain elevator in Duluth, but freed herself and cleared the harbor safely. It is thought that this is what caused the leak that sank her a few days later. On September 15, 1915 Onoko departed Duluth, Minnesota with 110.000 bushels of wheat bound for Toledo, Ohio. She sprang a major leak off Knife Island about 15 miles from Duluth, Minnesota. On September 15, 1915 the Duluth Herald wrote an article saying: > All went well and the sea was smooth, when while on the regular course, > about nine miles off Knife island, the engineer, J.J. Higgins, reported to > the master, Capt. W.R. Dunn, that the vessel had sprung a leak under the > engines and that the water was coming in fast. When Capt.

Onoko today The wreck of Onoko was discovered on April 10, 1988 by Jerry Eliason of Scanlon, Minnesota and Kraig Smith of Rice Lake, Wisconsin after they conducted a thorough search using a depth finder. Her wreck rests upside down in 220-feet of water with her stern buried almost completely in mud. Her hull is broken nearly in two, with the split in her hull right in front of her boilers. Her wreck is surrounded with a lot of artifacts from inside and outside her hull. Her cargo of grain is still in her cargo hold. It is illegal to remove artifacts from her wreck without permission because she is protected by the State of Minnesota.

The Carbon Canal is an irrigation canal in the central portion of Utah, United States. The canal was constructed by the Carbon Canal Company between 1907 and 1909 to provide water to agricultural fields west and south of the Price River.  Description  The Carbon Canal is a 28-mile long canal containing lined and unlined (i.e., earthen) sections. It begins at a weir on the Price River near the Spring Glen turn-off on U.S. Highway 6 and extends through Carbonville and the community of Price into Emery County to a point northeast of Elmo. It contains numerous flumes that carry the canal over rolling terrain.  History  From the beginning of Euro-American settlement in Carbon County, the Price River was one of a few perennial freshwater sources on which pioneers could rely. The river‚Äôs drainage was first permanently settled by Mormon pioneers in the late 1870s at Spring Glen. Within three years, other small settlements appeared at Carbonville, Price, Wellington, and Helper. With the exception of Helper, which was established to support trains making the climb over Soldier Summit, these communities depended on agriculture for basic subsistence. Thus, their dependence on freshwater sources‚Äîparticularly the Price River‚Äîfor more than culinary water was strong and deep. Crop production on the dry uplands was limited by a lack of facilities to carry water from the river. The first settlers reportedly carried water from the river in wooden barrels and tanks to their fields.Johnson, Jane Lyman. 1994. ‚ÄúPrice‚Äù in Utah History Encyclopedia, Allan Kent Powell, editor, pg. 444. University of Utah Press, Salt Lake City. This lasted until the settlers dug a series of small ditches to convey irrigation water to their fields. The ditches proved generally sufficient to serve the needs of the limited settler population until 1883, when the Denver & Rio Grande Western (D&RGW;) Railroad was completed through Utah. The railroad passed through the Price River communities on its way north through Spanish Fork Canyon and on to the Wasatch Front. The completion of the railroad transformed the communities from isolated farm towns to a booming railroad region almost overnight. The arrival of the railroad coincided with the discovery of vast coal reserves in the area, and within a few years, the communities of the Price River bustled with hundreds of miners, railroad men, and entrepreneurs, forever changing the sleepy Mormon bergs into Utah‚Äôs mecca of ethnic and religious diversity. The arrival of the railroad and mining industries saw a concurrent increase in the general settler population of the area as the economy grew sufficiently to allow for a community of supporting commercial enterprises. Most settlers not directly involved in the mining and railroading industries as laborers at least supplemented their household economy with agricultural pursuits if not relying entirely upon them. As the population grew and the demand for irrigation water increased, early ditches reached the limits of their capacity. It soon became clear to area farmers that a more extensive system was needed. The first large-scale effort to develop an irrigation system occurred in the late 1880s, when the newly formed Price Water Company completed what became known as the Price Canal. The canal, which was fed by a diversion on the Price River near the Spring Glen turn-off on SR-6, was completed in 1888. The canal‚Äîstill in use today‚Äîcarries water east and north of the Price River, skirting the northern and eastern parts of the Price community and ending several miles east of Wellington. = Initial construction = As the new century of the 1900s dawned, area farmers had reached a tipping point‚Äîeither acquire more water or forever limit agricultural production. By 1906, several representatives of the community joined together to incorporate the Carbon Canal Company (known over the years by other names). In August of that year, the company, represented by R. W. Crocket, applied to the State of Utah for water rights on the Price River for the purpose of constructing a canal that would carry irrigation water to lands west and south of Price and lands south of Wellington and the river.Application to Appropriate Water, # 91-3. 1906. Copy on file at the Carbon Canal Company, Price. The water right was granted on August 30, 1906 and received final approval in March 1907. The Certificate of Water Rights allocated 125 cubic feet per second (cfs) of Price River water to the Carbon Canal Company. According to the certificate, the diverting works on the river were to comprise ‚Äúa concrete diversion dam ‚Ä¶ and a canal measuring 149,737 ft. long, 5 to 18 ft. wide on top, 4 to 12 ft. wide in the bottom, having an effective depth from 2 to 6 ft.‚ÄùCertificate of Appropriation of Water. 1932. Certificate #2080. Utah State Engineer, Salt Lake City. The length of the canal would carry it through the southern part of Carbon County and into the now-abandoned northern Emery County town of Victor. The diversion dam was to be located roughly 4 miles north of Price. The water right granted to the Carbon Canal Company provided for agricultural water use through the system between April 1 and September 30 each year ‚Äúto irrigate 7,973.46 acres of land‚Ä¶‚Äù The certificate also allowed the company to divert up to 25 cfs from October 1 and March 31 each year for ‚Äúdomestic and culinary purposes‚Äù as well as the winter watering of domestic livestock. Work on the Carbon Canal began shortly after the granting of the water right. By January 1908, the Emery County Progress newspaper reported that work on the canal was ‚Äúwell under way‚Äù by the firm of Snow, Waterman and Williams of Spanish Fork, Utah.Emery County Progress. 1908. ‚ÄúWork on Big Canal Under Way.‚Äù January 25. The newspaper noted that numerous construction camps had been established along the proposed route of the canal and 100 men and 60 livestock teams were on-site. Lumber and cement were reportedly being brought in by rail to Helper and then transported to the work sites, presumably by wagon teams or truck teams. No other information could be found regarding the initial construction of the canal. The canal was completed in 1909 and included six wooden flumes‚ÄîGordon Creek, Garley Wash, Pinnacle Wash, Drunkard‚Äôs Wash, Miller Creek, and Olsen‚Äôs Wash‚Äîand a 280-foot tunnel.Watt, Ronald G. 1997.

The flume at Olsen‚Äôs Wash was later replaced with an undershoot. = Expanding the irrigation network = Farmers in the area then constructed a network of smaller ditches to carry water from the canal to their agricultural lands, including fields south of the Price River. The completion of the canal, with its weir upstream of the community of Price and its lack of diversions south of Wellington, finally provided a relatively reliable supply of irrigation water to farmlands south of the Price River. The irrigation water supply to Wellington was supplemented by water from the Price Canal, a 5.5-mile extension of which was completed into Wellington the same year as the completion of the Carbon Canal and irrigated lands north of the river. Because the Price Canal had many diversions and water users along its route to Wellington, the water supply was often lower than anticipated‚Äîupstream users having used more water than their allocated water right. The first major effort to impound water on the Price River drainage had started in 1896 with the forming of the Mammoth Reservoir Company. The company was specifically organized to develop water storage facilities in the mountains northwest of Price, at the site of present-day Scofield Reservoir.Stene, Eric A. 1995. Scofield Project. Bureau of Reclamation. Retrieved online April 17, 2017 at: https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=424 Shortly thereafter, several farmers in Sanpete County acquired the reservoir company‚Äôs water rights to allow them to divert water to their lands. In 1902, they sold their water rights to the Irrigated Lands Company, which began construction of the Mammoth Dam in 1907. In 1911, the Irrigated Lands Company reorganized as Price River Irrigation Company. On June 25, 1917, the partially completed dam collapsed, releasing 11,000 acre-feet of water downstream and causing an estimated $1 million in flood damage throughout the drainage. Shortly thereafter, the Price River Irrigation Company abandoned the project altogether. Still needing water storage in the region, the Price River Water Conservation District (PRWCD) formed in 1921. The PRWCD oversaw the construction of the Scofield Dam between 1925 and 1926, funding it through a bonding effort. The PRWCD contracted with a number of ditch companies to deliver reservoir water through their canals. = Reconstructing the flumes = As the Carbon Canal continued to provide irrigation water to southern Carbon County and northern Emery County, the canal structure began to degrade from the use. Lacking deep financial reserves, the canal company applied for a loan from the state land board (part of the present-day Department of Natural Resources) to complete much needed repairs. In 1926, the land board authorized a loan of $20,000 to the canal company, with $5,000 of the funding to be used to replace the wooden sidehill flume at Drunkard‚Äôs Wash (i.e., Drunkard‚Äôs Creek) with a concrete-lined canal resting on newly placed earthen fill.News Advocate. 1926a. ‚ÄúWork on Carbon Canal Company Ditch Under Way.‚Äù September 16. Additional work to be conducted under the loan included ‚Äútearing out the sluice gate at what is known as Sand wash‚Äù and replacing it with a series of dykes and iron pipes. Work at the flume commenced in September 1926, after the end of the irrigation season. One caveat of the loan from the state land board was that all work conducted with the funding had to be overseen by the Utah State Engineer, George M. Bacon, and according to his repair plan. It appears, however, that such oversight and adherence to a plan not of their making did not sit well with the board of the canal company, despite their signing off on the requirement in the loan agreement. Within a few days of starting the repair work at Drunkard‚Äôs Wash, the canal company (known at that time as the Carbon County Land and Water Company), sent a telegraph message to the state engineer‚Äôs office protesting the plan of repair outlined by Bacon and stating that they would not allow any further expenditure of loan funds on the work until such time as they had been granted a meeting with the state land board to discuss their objections to the repair plans.Salt Lake Telegram. 1926a. ‚ÄúCanal Repairs Held Up for Agreement.‚Äù September 17. The dispute between the canal company, the state land board, and the state engineer roiled for nearly two months, as the canal company proceeded with repairs according to their own plans‚Äîignoring those of the state engineer‚Äîand the state engineer condemning the work.News Advocate. 1926b. ‚ÄúLabor on Carbon Canal Condemned by State Engineer.‚Äù November 4. State Engineer Bacon contended the work done by the canal company violated the terms of the loan agreement and jeopardized the ability of the canal to provide irrigators with reliable water in the upcoming irrigation season. The dispute went so far as to result in Bacon withholding ‚Äúthe last payroll for work done‚Äù until the state land board had resolved the issue and provided him with written direction to approve the expenditure. The land board appears to have attempted to resolve the dispute by asking Bacon to adopt the canal company‚Äôs repair plan over the one he himself had developed, but Bacon had declined, presumably due to specific engineering concerns though Bacon himself would note that the work at Drunkard‚Äôs Wash ‚Äúlooks like a first class job.‚Äù As the impasse continued, the canal company had reached a point of no return in terms of physical changes to the canal. By early November, the entire original flume at Drunkard‚Äôs Wash had been demolished and the earthen embankment upon which the new concrete-lined canal would rest had been constructed. The cost for that work had already reached $7,000, two-thousand dollars more than the original allocation under the loan. Bacon noted that no one involved on the canal company‚Äôs side could provide an estimate of the final cost to complete the canal section in question. Elsewhere, the canal company had commenced on the construction of a new concrete flume at Gordon Creek. Roughly one week later, on November 11, 1926, the News Advocate newspaper reported that a resolution of the dispute was reached. Ultimately, the newspaper stated, the canal company board would accept the repair plan outlined by Bacon and the loan requirement that all work be approved by him.News Advocate. 1926c. ‚ÄúFight over Work on Carbon Canal is Finally Ended.‚Äù November 11. The canal company board agreed not to interfere with Bacon as the work progressed, and all foremen of work crews were directed to take ‚Äúorders only from the state engineer.‚Äù As a final component of the resolution, Bacon was absolved on any responsibility or liability for the work done on the Drunkard‚Äôs Wash flume. The canal company board did request, however, that Bacon review, and depending on his findings, approve the work on the flume. They agreed that if Bacon did not approve the work, they would not use funding from the state land board loan to cover the cost but would, instead, raise funds with a special assessment (a fee) on the water users. Two weeks later, on November 25, 1926, the News Advocate reported that water had been turned into the Drunkard‚Äôs Wash section of the canal and initial indications were that the work completed there was satisfactory.News Advocate. 1926d. ‚ÄúSide Hill Work on Improved Carbon Canal Tested Out.‚Äù November 25. Financial challenges continued to plague the canal company. Flooding in August 1927 caused severe damage to many of the flumes and other structures along the canal. Lacking sufficient in- house funds for the repair work, the company sought another loan from the state land board‚Äîthis time for $51,000.Salt Lake Telegram. 1928a. ‚ÄúCarbon Canal Co. Obligations May Be Paid at Once.‚Äù January 9. The Salt Lake Telegram reported that the state was willing to authorize the loan, adding it to an existing $67,000 debt owed by the canal company on prior loans so long as an existing second mortgage held by the Utah Savings and Trust Company was paid first. A bonding group associated with the canal company paid Utah Savings and Trust the sum of $18,000, clearing the way for the $51,000 loan from the state land board.Salt Lake Telegram. 1928b. ‚ÄúCarbon Canal Mixup is Ended‚Äù January 10. The loan reportedly brought the total debt owed to the land board by the canal company to $118,000 (the equivalent of approximately $1.65 million in 2017). Repairs commenced shortly after the authorization of the loan with the Whitney-Reynolds Company selected as the contractor. The work, which included cleaning out the entire canal channel, was essentially complete by April 30, 1928, when water was turned into the newly built flumes.Salt Lake Telegram.1928c. ‚ÄúCarbon Canal Water Turned In.‚Äù April 30. = Great Depression and World War II development = The Great Depression started the year after the flood repairs, and a severe drought gripped Utah beginning in 1931. Across the state, low crop yields, coupled with weak markets, led many water users to default on their payments to canal companies. The Carbon Canal Company appears to have struggled with their continued financial woes, and the State of Utah assumed ownership of the Carbon Canal assets in early 1932 due to the outstanding debt of the canal company.Salt Lake Telegram. 1934. ‚ÄúRuling Promised on Debt Request.‚Äù October 10.Salt Lake Telegram. 1937a. ‚ÄúCarbon Canal Shift Planned.‚Äù August 10. A 1934 Salt Lake Telegram article refers to the canal as the ‚Äústate controlled Carbon canal (sic)‚Äù and notes that the canal company still owes the state $65,000. Despite the challenges, the canal company soldiered on, attempting in 1937 to raise money through an additional assessment on its water users to complete what was referred to as ‚Äúthe Miller Creek flume project.‚Äù Salt Lake Telegram. 1937b. ‚ÄúCarbon Canal Work Conference Called.‚Äù June 17. The project was expected to cost $6,000, but the contribution of labor by the Soil Conservation Service (the modern predecessor to the Natural Resources Conservation Service) reduced the anticipated cost to users to approximately half that amount. In 1937, the Utah legislature passed a bill to address ownership of the canal. The state proposed that the Price River Water Conservation District (PRWCD), which was formed in 1921 to develop water storage along the Price River, would assume control of the assets from the state. In the same session, the legislature also voted to cancel the reported $140,000 debt owed by the canal company as part of transferring the canal to the PRWCD. It appears from historical meeting minutes that the canal company recovered its ownership of the canal during the 1940s. Financial difficulties weren‚Äôt the only challenge faced by Price River water users during the years of the Great Depression. By the late 1920s, the dam at Scofield was beginning to fail, threatening a catastrophic flood and damage or destruction of extensive mining operations, the D&RGW; railroad, and other facilities. Also during this time, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) began planning the Gooseberry Project‚Äîwhich would replace the Scofield Dam and reservoir‚Äîto irrigate lands in Carbon County and Sanpete County. The announcement of these plans kicked off decades of litigation that continued for more than 80 years. The project has yet to be constructed. Company records indicate the 1940s were largely spent repairing or replacing components of the canal system. This included repair or replacement of the Drunkard‚Äôs Wash flume around 1944 or 1945. Additional improvements during the period appear from company records to have included construction of a drop structure known as the Marsing Drop, changes to the Gordon Creek flume, and consideration was given to the installation of 153 Parshall flumes along the canal.Carbon Canal Company, 1948. Minutes of the Carbon Control Committee, April 7, 1948. Upstream from the canal, much activity was underway during the 1940s to address the challenges at the Scofield Dam. As noted above, the dam had started to deteriorate significantly during the late 1920s. The outlet tunnel had failed numerous times, and an embankment was eroding away. On May 21, 1928, a beaver tunneling into the dam nearly caused the entire dam to fail. In an emergency effort to decrease the pressure on the dam, the spillway was lowered several feet; it was lowered another 7.5 feet a few years later and then again in 1942. The looming failure of the Scofield Dam posed a national threat as the U.S. entered World War II. Wartime demand for the mineral resources of Carbon County and the transport power of the D&RGW; railroad placed these resources in the national spotlight. The potential loss or temporary shut-down of the mines and railroad created an unacceptable risk to the U.S. war effort at home, prompting the federal government to get involved. The complicated web of water rights to the existing reservoir and Price River watershed created numerous challenges to addressing the issues as the Scofield Dam. The situation ultimately prompted then-President Franklin Roosevelt to authorize construction of a new Scofield Dam project on June 24, 1943 under the provisions of the Water Conservation and Utilization Act of 1939. Construction of the new dam began September 13, 1943 and was sufficiently advanced by November 1945 for water to be impounded in the reservoir. Final construction was completed in October 1947. On April 1, 1949, the Carbon Water Conservancy District, which was formed in 1943 and which signed a repayment contract with the BOR for $216,000, assumed responsibility for the maintenance and operation of the Scofield Dam. = The Post-War Period = No major system upgrades appear to have been carried out on the Carbon Canal during the remainder of the historical period (i.e., up to ca. 1970). Routine maintenance and flood prevention projects were carried out, including revetment work done in 1953 at Gibbs Cut, south of the Carbon Country Club, to protect the Carbon Canal from damage. The revetments consisted of 65-pound steel rails and cedar timbers.Carbon Canal Company. 1953. Contractor agreement between the Carbon Canal Company and Thomas E. Lamph and John Bene. On file at the Carbon Canal Company, Price. In 1957, the canal company borrowed $4,000 (at 7% interest) from the Carbon Emery Bank of Price to pay for raising the flume and replacing the abutments where the Carbon Canal crosses Pinnacle Wash.Carbon Canal Company. 1957. Minutes of the Board of Directors Meeting, October 3, 1957. On file at the Carbon Canal Company, Price. The debt was to be repaid by November 1 of the following year. In 1966, the canal company board introduced a resolution to borrow additional funds to partner with the Carbon Country Club to enlarge and re-align the course of the Price River directly below the diversion point of the Price Canal to address anticipated flood damage to the Carbon Canal diverting works a short distance downstream.Carbon Canal Company. 1966. Minutes of the Board of Directors Meeting, February 14, 1966. On file at the Carbon Canal Company, Price. It is unclear if that work was ever completed. Two years later, in 1968, the flume at Drunkard‚Äôs Wash was lined with fiberglass to prevent water leakage and address other damage, some of which was apparently caused by the use of the flume as a swimming location by local youth.Carbon Canal Company. 1968. Contractor agreement between the Carbon Canal Company and Val E. Rigby. On file at the Carbon Canal Company, Price. Operations during the 1950s included at least two water use agreements entered into by the Carbon Canal Company to supply a portion of its allocated water rights in the Price River to other parties. Specifically, in 1956, the canal company entered into a water use agreement with Utah Power & Light (UP&L;) to furnish water to UP&L;‚Äôs power plant at Castle Gate (i.e., the Carbon Plant).Carbon Canal Company. 1956a. Minutes of the Board of Directors Meeting, May 8, 1956. On file at the Carbon Canal Company, Price. The canal company was to provide up to 1600 acre feet of ‚Äúdirect flow of water‚Äù to the plant. The water was to be furnished via the canal company‚Äôs existing water rights on the Price River and not from the Carbon Canal itself. UP&L; paid an initial sum of $10,000 for use of the water and an annual fee based on the specific amount of water used that year.Carbon Canal Company. 1956b. Correspondence from Therald N. Jensen, Attorney for the Carbon Canal Company, to the Utah Power & Light Company. On file at the Carbon Canal Company, Price. The price per acre foot of water used by UP&L; was set at $4.00.Carbon Canal Company. 1956c. Agreement between the Carbon Canal Company and the Utah Power & Light Company. On file at the Carbon Canal Company, Price. In December of the following year, 1957, the canal company entered into a short-term agreement with the Shell Oil Company to provide water from their canal to the oil company‚Äôs drilling operations in the ‚ÄúMiller Creek Area‚Äù until the start of the 1958 irrigation season.Carbon Canal Company. 1958. Correspondence between the Carbon Canal Company and Shell Oil Company, April 8, 1958. On file at the Carbon Canal Company, Price. The oil company was to receive 1 acre foot of water per day for the daily rate of $20.00. The 1960s saw the Carbon Canal Company in the throes of a series of lawsuits over individual water rights, company water rights, and water rights priorities with a number of different parties. Much of the litigation centered around the proposed Gooseberry Project and the potential diversion of water from the Price River drainage to Sanpete County. Lawsuits over the proposed Gooseberry Project began almost as soon as the project was proposed by the Bureau of Reclamation in the 1930s. Over the ensuing decades, various water users, including the Carbon Canal Company, had filed suits over the distribution and priority of water rights in the Price River. The lawsuits filed by the canal company appear, at least in part from available documents, to have focused on procedural failings in the granting of water rights to users in Sanpete County, particularly the Sanpete Water Users Association (SPWUA). In 1960, the Utah Supreme Court upheld an earlier district court decision, which had been challenged by the Carbon Canal Company, allowing additional time for potential Sanpete County water users of the proposed Gooseberry Project to develop plans for storage facilities and water tunnels to carry irrigation water from the Price River drainage into the Sanpitch River drainage.Manti Messenger. 1960. ‚ÄúGooseberry Decision Upheld by Utah Supreme Court.‚Äù July 7. A few years later, in 1965, the Carbon Canal Company filed a lawsuit against the Cottonwood‚ÄìGooseberry Irrigation Company and others over water rights to the Price River drainage. This case, as with the 1960 court decision, did not turn out in favor of the canal company. In a 1967 Utah Supreme Court decision on cases of the Carbon Canal Company and the Price River Water Improvement District (PRWID) against the SPWUA, the court found in favor of the canal company that their water right claim of 1937 had priority over a 1924 claim by the SPWUA because the SPWUA had missed deadlines for filing their claim and making subsequent filings.Utah Supreme Court Case No. 10122 and 10123. August 1967. Copy on file at the Carbon Canal Company, Price. Unfortunately for the Carbon Canal Company, the litigation over the Gooseberry Project continued well into the modern era. Throughout its history, the Carbon Canal has been a vital component of rural agricultural life in Carbon County. To some, the canal is nothing more than a simple ditch in the ground. But to many, its trenches and dugways, its flumes and diversions, are a constant reminder of tremendous effort of the settlers of the early 1900s to bring water to the dry lands of the area and sustain an agricultural way of life for generations to come. The canal remains in use today, continuing its more than 100-year-old job of delivering water to a parched land. = Modern era = Over its long history, the Carbon Canal has quietly and consistently done its job with the help of Carbon Canal Company, which maintains and repairs the aging infrastructure. Periodic flood events, particularly flash floods, have taken their toll on the canal and often overwhelm the diversion structure on the Price River. To address this issue, the canal company, in cooperation with the Natural Resources Conservation Service, is embarking upon an effort to repair and replace the diversion dam and intake structure at the headwaters of the Carbon Canal. This effort, which should be completed in 2018, will leave portions of the original dam in place. These remains will stand as a reminder to future generations of the efforts of early pioneers to harness the water of the Price River and create an agricultural industry in their Carbon County settlements.

He was the nephew of Simon Chevrot, abbot of Goailles, counsellor to the duke and president of the council - Simon took a keen interest in Jean's education and also collaborated with his friend Jean Chousat to get Jean Chevrot onto the duke's counsel. He began his political career in the decade after 1433. He was sent to England in 1433 and 1434 as one of the ambassadors aiming to convince Henry VI of England to conclude a general peace treaty and release Charles I of Orl√©ans. He accompanied Philip the Good to Nevers then to Paris to attend the peace talks which culminated in the Treaty of Arras. After a long and complex struggle with Jean d'Harcourt, Jean Chevrot became bishop of Tournai on 5 November 1436 and was installed in his cathedral on 12 January 1440, accompanied by Isabella and several gentlemen. =Later years= When Philip edited his will on 8 December 1441 he put Isabella in charge of the duchy and Philip's successor Charles, with Jean Chevrot as her deputy. Between 1444 and 1457 Chevrot began to retire from the Aulic Council, but continued to fulfil his everyday functions as bishop. However, he was now only entrusted with other tasks in exceptional circumstances, giving way to Jean de Thoisy and Guillaume Fill√¢tre, the duke's favoured councillor.

Civilian life  Mareseva was born on 20 June 1923 to a Russian family in Cherkaskoe village, located within present-day Volsky district of the Saratov Oblast; her father was a shepherd on a collective farm. After graduating from secondary school she attended medical courses until being transferred to work at a cement plant due to the start of the war.  Military career  When Mareseva's father was sent to the front lines after the start of Soviet involvement in the war she repeatedly applied to join the ranks of the military after her medical training was ceased but was initially rejected. Eventually she entered military nursing courses, joining the Red Army in 1942 after graduating from her brief medical training. She was sent to the Eastern front in late November that same year as part of the 38th Rifle Division, which later received the Guards designation and became the 73rd Guards Rifle Division.Heroines, Issue. II. (Essays on Women - Heroes of the Soviet Union). M., Politizdat, 1969. She fought on the Stalingrad, Voronezh and Steppe fronts as a medic, and for her actions in battle on 8 February 1943 she was awarded the Medal \\"For Battle Merit\\", and was awarded the Order of the Red Star after rescuing 38 injured soldiers in the Battle of Kursk. On 1 August 1943 her regiment was ordered to cross the Donets river to reach Southern Belgorod. The crossing, between the cities of Solomino and Toplinka, involved dodging heavy artillery fire and avoiding two Nazi infantry divisions worth of enemy troops; the right bank of the river contained large numbers of landmines and was fully controlled by the Axis. After a prolonged battle the Soviet Guardsmen were able to take control of a small portion of the bridgehead on the right bank, and despite heavy losses from shelling, bombings, and mortar attacks, the unit continued to proceed with the offensive. Throughout the battle, Mareseva treated wounded soldiers, and when the gunfire ceased upon nightfall she carried the wounded soldiers to the safety of the trenches on the left bank of the river. On 2 August, after numerous casualties due to persistent Axis counterattacks, after the eighth counterattack, Soviet forces were weakened to a point that an Axis unit managed to bypass their stronghold at the left bank of the river. Heavily outnumbered, Soviet forces began to retreat, which was illegal under Order No. 227, known for enforcing the catchphrase \\"Not one step back!\\"; Mareseva, noticing the Nazi approach towards the trenches where the injured soldiers remained, and convinced the retreating soldiers to turn around and continue fighting, having grabbed her pistol and started running towards the approaching enemy fighters. In the confrontation led by Mareseva, over 150 enemy combatants were killed, and they managed to seize eight machine guns, two mortars and 20 grenade launchers. After leading the attack, she carried the injured off the battlefield and continued to treat the wounded. With their victory, the Soviets managed to improvise a safer pedestrian bridge for the transport of the wounded to the left bank as opposed to having to use a boat, but the bridge was destroyed by enemy fire overnight. On the morning of 3 August, while transporting wounded soldiers to the safety of the trenches on the left bank by boat, she used her body as a human shield to defend her fellow soldiers from a mortar attack, and died from her injuries three days later. She was posthumously declared a Hero of the Soviet Union on 22 February 1944 for her bravery in the crossing of the river, during which she treated 64 wounded soldiers.

He was suffect consul in the nundinium of November to December 55 as the colleague of Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus.Paul A. Gallivan, \\"Some Comments on the Fasti for the Reign of Nero\\", Classical Quarterly, 24 (1974), p. No other senator with his gentilicium is known, so Mancia seems to have been a homo novus.Ronald Syme, \\"Personal Names in Annals I-VI\\", Journal of Roman Studies, 39 (1949), pp. 6‚Äì18. His origins are not known for sure; however, there are several indications that he came from Gallia Narbonensis. At this time several senators came from this province, probably due to the influence of Nero's advisor, Sextus Afranius Burrus. In addition, his daughter married Gnaeus Domitius Lucanus, a member of the Narbonensian aristocracy.Werner Eck, Die Statthalter der germanischen Provinzen im 1.‚Äì3. Jahrhundert (K√∂ln/Bonn: Rheinland-Verlag in Kommission bei Rudolf Habelt, 1985), p. 25 His granddaughter, Domitia Lucilla Major, was, through her eponymous daughter, grandmother of the emperor Marcus Aurelius.  Life  Details of Mancia's life are known only after his consulate. According to the ancient writer Phlegon of Tralles he was governor of the imperial province of Germania Superior by the year 56 as the successor of Lucius Antistius Vetus.Phlegon of Tralles, De mirabilibus 27 (Fragmenta historicorum Graecorum, Volume 3, Fragment 56) He still held this office in the year 58, for Tacitus attests that his colleague in Germania Inferior, Lucius Duvius Avitus, asked him this year for military support for the campaign against the Ampsivarii. Mancia appears to have agreed to Duvius' request and campaigned with an army beyond the Rhine.Tacitus, Annales, XIII.54-56 It is not known when Mancia resigned the governorship; he possibly remained in Germania Superior until the appointment of Publius Sulpicius Scribonius Proculus, in the year 63.Eck, Die Statthalter der germanischen Provinzen, p. 26 Several ancient inscriptions attest to the Lex Manciana, a law on the administration of state and imperial land ownership in the province of Africa. Various scholars have assumed from its name that Titus Curtilius Mancia enacted it. In turn, they have argued that he had been either governor or extraordinary legate of the emperor in that province, either during the reign of Nero or the Flavian dynasty.An example is Eric Birley, in his review of Bengt E. Thomasson, Die Statthalter der R√∂mischen Provinzen Nordafrikas von Augustus bis Diocletianus, Journal of Roman Studies, 52 (1962), pp. 219‚Äì227 Ultimately, however, it is not certain whether Mancia is connected to the law, nor whether it was created at all during his lifetime. Pliny the Younger reports in one of his letters that Mancia disliked his son-in-law, Domitius Lucanus. For this reason, he left his inheritance to his granddaughter on the condition that Lucanus release her from his power as paterfamilias; this would prevent Lucanus from benefiting from the inheritance. This Lucanus did, only to have his brother Gnaeus Domitius Tullus adopt her, allowing both brothers to benefit from her inheritance.Pliny, Epistulae, VIII.18.4  References  1st-century Romans Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Roman governors of Germania Superior ","title":"Titus Curtilius Mancia"},{"id":"56513708","text":"Jean de Harcourt (died 13 June 1452) was a French priest and bishop.

His nomination to Tournai displeased Philip the Good, who held back the bishopric's revenues. The Pope gave in and instead made him bishop of Narbonne in 1436, although he did not accept that bishopric, feeling he was being forced to do so by the king of France. The inhabitants of Tournai were so supportive of de Harcourt that they tore apart the count of Estampes in the episcopal chair - he had been sent by the duke to take possession of the see.

The song \\"Paskutinƒó kulka\\" is dedicated to Lionginas Baliukeviƒçius-Dz≈´kas, while \\"Broliai aitvarai\\" was inspired by the insights found in his diary on his brothers-in-arms who no longer feared death (\\"broliai, nugalƒójƒô mirtƒØ\\", brothers who have defeated death).

As a two-year-old in 1913 she failed to win a race but was very consistent, finishing placed in seven of her eight starts. In the following year she was probably the best three-year-old filly in England, winning both the 1000 Guineas and the Epsom Oaks. She was retired at the end of the 1914 season and had modest success as a broodmare. Background Princess Dorrie was a brown mare bred in England by Jack Barnato Joel who also owned her during her racing career. She was trained by Joel's private trainer Charles Morton at Wantage in Berkshire. She was one of the best horses sired by Joel's stallion Your Majesty who won the Eclipse Stakes and St Leger Stakes in 1908. Her dam Doris showed little ability as a racecourse and was given to Joel by his brother Solomon who commented \\"I don't think she's much good, you can have her if you like.\\" Doris became an exceptional broodmare who also produced Sunstar, Bright (second in the Oaks Stakes) and the Dewhurst Stakes winner White Star. Racing career=1913: two-year-old season= Princess Dorrie ran eight times as a two-year-old in 1913, and failed to win a race although she was matched against very strong competition. She finished unplaced in the Windsor Castle Stakes at Royal Ascot, second to The Tetrarch in a Rous Memorial Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse, second to Mira in the Acorn Stakes at Epsom, second to Lord Derby's filly Glorvinda in the Mersey Stakes at Liverpool, third in the Prince of Wales Nursery, second to First Spear in the Bretby Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse and third to Vaila in the Moulton Stakes at the same track in October. =1914: three-year-old season= Princess Dorrie began her second season by finishing third to the colt My Prince in the Tudor Plate at Sandown Park in April. On 1 of May Princess Dorrie started at odds of 100/9 (11/1) for the 101st running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket. The favourite Torchlight went to the front around half way but Princess Dorrie, ridden by the Australian jockey Bill Huxley, took the lead in the closing stages and won three quarters of a length and a neck from Glorvina (later to win the Queen's Vase) and Torchlight. Georges Stern, who rode the favourite, appeared to ride a poor tactical race: he was criticised for going to the front too early, panicking when challenged by Princess Dorrie, and then easing his filly down to lose second place on the line. Princess Dorrie was stepped up in distance for the 136th Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 29 of May and with Huxley again in the saddle, started 11/4 favourite ahead of Glorvina and Torchlight in a twenty-one runner field. After looking unlikely to obtain a clear run in the straight she produced a \\"fine burst of speed\\" and won comfortably by two lengths from Wassilissa with a gap of four lengths back to Torchlight in third. Wassilissa was ridden by E. Huxley, the brother of the winning jockey. The race was a rather rough one, and the winner returned to the paddock bleeding from cuts to her heel and hock. Some early telegraph reports of the race confused the filly's odds with the weight she had carried and stated that she had won the race under 11-4 (158 pounds). One commentator in New Zealand drily remarked that she \\"must be a pretty useful mare if she can carry 32lb overweight and then win comfortably\\". In October Princess Dorrie was matched against older horses in the Cesarewitch Handicap over two and a quarter miles at Newmarket. She started second favourite but never looked likely to win and finished unplaced behind the outsider Troubador. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Princess Dorrie an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas and a \\"poor\\" winner of the Oaks. Breeding record At the end of her racing career, Princess Dorrie became a broodmare for her owner's stud. She produced at least five foals between 1917 and 1922: *Queen of Jest, a brown filly, foaled in 1917, sired by Black Jester *Black Queen, brown filly, 1919, by Black Jester *Queen of Diamonds, chestnut filly, 1920 Polymelus. Female- line ancestor of Knock Hard and Thirteen of Diamonds (Irish Derby). *Glorious, chestnut filly, 1921, by Gay Crusader *Magnus, bay colt, 1922, by The Tetrarch. Winner.

King was widely and popularly known under the nom de plume of ‚ÄúMarguerite‚Äù. She wrote for the Dundee Evening Telegraph on topics of dress, men, women, and manners. Early years and education Jessie Margaret King was born at Bankfoot, in the parish of Auchtergaven, Perthshire, in 1862, and received her education at the village school there. She was delicate as a child, but was very studious, and a great reader. Her father encouraged her in her studies; and every now and then a box of miscellaneous reading magazines, reviews, and so forth would come on a carrier's cart from Perth, where her uncle, James Sprunt, was editor of the Perthshire Advertiser. At school, she was a good pupil, carrying off many prizes and the girls‚Äô dux medal. Preparing herself for a career as a teacher, but she had been only just entered at Sharp's Institution, Perth, when her father fell ill, and this altered all the family plans. After a long illness he died. Career After her father's death, King began working in an office in the village. While there, the Free Church ‚ÄúWelfare of Youth of the Church Scheme‚Äù came into existence, and in the paper's ‚ÄúEssay Section‚Äù she found a place for her budding literary energies. The first year, she was seventh on the list, the next, she was first in the senior section and third in the junior. The following year, she again competed for both essays, and then carried off the first prize in the junior and senior sections. She continued to compete in connection with this ‚Äúscheme‚Äù up to 1885, and gained four first prizes ‚Äî‚Äî a medal accompanying each, including Junior Section first place with medal in July 1882, for her essay on \\"Elijah\\". After being two years in the Bankfoot office, King received an appointment in the Dundee Advertiser office, and shortly afterwards, attained a responsible and important position on the staff of the Dundee Evening Telegraph. It was not until about 1884 that King began to write verse. Her first attempt, a poem entitled, ‚ÄúCloudland,\\" was printed. For a year or two, she wrote very frequently with most of her poems appearing under various pen-names in the Telegraph and Friend. Style Her style was characterized as exceedingly attractive, terse, clear, and apt, while her original comments and reflections were judiciously and racily intermixed. She had a graphic pen, and possessed the faculty of always being able to seize upon points of interest and importance, and of giving due proportion and symmetry to the various phases of her subject. Her poetry was highly imaginative, frequently lively, and sparkling and vivid in expression. There was felicity in her choice of subject, and an elevating method of treatment peculiarly her own. Her poems were marked by a high moral tone and deep human feeling, and they evinced power and facility over the difficulties of rhyme and versification.

Life The Correr family was an old patrician family in Venice. Teodoro's father was Giacomo and his wife, the Neapolitan noblewoman Anna Maria Petagno, daughter of Andrea, from the princely family of Trebisaccia. Teodoro was the first of nine brothers and aged ten was sent to school with the Teatini at San Nicola da Tolentino. He only stayed there a year before moving to the San Cipriano college on Murano, which he left aged twenty-one in 1771. Even as a youth he became interested in collecting objects and artworks relating to Venice and its history. When they reached twenty-five all Venetian patricians were required to take up minor magistracies and Correr reluctantly followed suit. In 1775 he entered the High Council and the same year was elected 'savio' to the Orders. The following year he was made provider of the Pompe and in 1778 he was re-elected 'savio' and made provider of the Comun. In 1787 he was elected Podest√† and captain of Treviso, but he immediately gained dispensation from taking up this office. In 1788 he became podest√† procurator at Verona. He only half-heartedly held public office and finally eschewed it altogether by becoming an abbot in 1789. He even declined to serve in the Civic Guard on health grounds during the Fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797 and instead paid a cash fine in monthly instalments. After his parents died, he was able to commit himself to collecting full-time, though he had already begun forming a collection of paintings, relics and documents relating to Venetian history whilst still a young man. His collecting peaked during the years immediately after the Republic's fall and the resulting decision by many patrician families to sell off their whole art collections. Despite his limited means, he used his connections to other patrician families to buy and exchange paintings, coins, archaeology. majolica, glassware, books, engravings, gems, enamels, medals, curiosities, weapons, antiquities, bronzes and manuscripts. He installed his growing collection in his family palazzo in the San Giovanni Decollato district of the Santa Croce sestiere. Entrance to the Museo Correr. In old age he wondered how to ensure his collection stayed together after his death, rather than being dispersed by his brother. He wrote his will on 1 January 1830, stipulating: This marked the beginning of Venice's city museums and formed the foundation stone for the current museum network in the city. Correr's collection formed the nucleus for the present-day Museo Correr, which moved in 1879 to the neighbouring Fondaco dei Turchi (now the Museo di Storia Naturale) then to the former Palazzo Reale (or Procuratie Nuovissime) on Piazza San Marco in 1922, where it still remains.

Each chapter title is a question about race in contemporary America. Oluo outlines her opinions on the topics as well as advice about how to talk about the issues. The book received positive critical reception, with renewed interest following the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, after which the book re- entered The New York Times Best Seller list. Background Author Ijeoma Oluo was an editor-at-large at The Establishment. So You Want to Talk About Race is her first book. Oluo was convinced into writing a book by her agent, who conceived of a \\"guidebook\\" in which Oluo answered questions she regularly received on social media or addressed in her essays. Oluo was reluctant to spend so much time writing about race, but was inspired after beginning to ask people what issues they face when talking about race and hearing the responses of people of color. The book was published by Seal Press. Synopsis The book is about race in the contemporary United States, each chapter titled after a question. Oluo makes the argument that America's political, economic and social systems are systematically/institutionally racist. The book provides advice for readers when discussing race-related subjects, such as how to avoid acting defensive or getting off-topic. Statistics are used to support the book's arguments. Oluo also describes her upbringing and experience living in Seattle, Washington. She was raised by a white single mother and became a single mother herself to two mixed-race sons at a young age. The book also covers topics including affirmative action, cultural appropriation, intersectionality, microaggressions, police brutality and the school-to-prison pipeline. Oluo argues that use of the word \\"nigger\\" or other racial slurs by white people is not appropriate even if the intention is ironic or the motive anti-racist. Reception The book received renewed attention following the killing of George Floyd in May 2020. Having been listed for one week previously, it re-entered The New York Times Best Seller list in the category Combined Print & E-book Nonfiction on June 14, 2020, peaking at position #2 on June 21. It remained on the list until September 13 and reappeared October 4. =Critical reception= Bustle named So You Want to Talk about Race to a list of 14 recommended debut books by women, praising Oluo's \\"no holds barred writing style\\", as well as to a list of the 16 best non-fiction books of January 2018. Harper's Bazaar also named it to a list of 10 best new books of 2018, saying \\"Oluo crafts a straightforward guidebook to the nuances of conversations surrounding race in America.\\" The New York Times listed the book in its \\"New & Noteworthy\\" column. Publishers Weekly praised Oluo's commentary as \\"thoughtful\\", \\"insightful\\" and \\"not preachy\\". Jenny Ferguson of the Washington Independent Review of Books found Oluo's style to be \\"intellectually sharp and even funny\\", praising the \\"punchy one- and two- liners\\". She thought that white readers would \\"gain insight\\" on the book and found that the book's tone and use of direct address made reading an \\"intimate experience\\". Salons Erin Keane reviewed that the book is \\"accessible and approachable\\" and recommended it as \\"a highly productive book-in-common for high school seniors in America\\". Jenny Bhatt of The National Book Review wrote that the book is \\"a comprehensive conversation guide\\" with arguments presented \\"thoroughly and rationally\\". Bhatt found \\"no ambivalence or soft-pedaling\\" in the book, praising Oluo for being \\"even-keeled\\" when discussing her personal experiences. Ferguson criticised the use of the term \\"Indigenous American\\" in the book as an example of \\"Oluo's own basic assumptions that create an inhospitable climate for other racially marked bodies\\". Oluo responded that future editions of the book would instead use the term \\"indigenous peoples\\". Bhatt suggested that a further reading list would have improved the book.

The company was Spotify‚Äôs first partner in the offline streaming music space when they publicly launched in July 2017.  Products = Mighty = Mighty Audio is one of two official partners of Spotify in the offline streaming space, the other being Samsung. The first product Mighty is 1.5 x 1.5 inches, 0.6 ounces, drop and water resistant, Bluetooth and WiFi enabled, has an 8GB storage capacity, and up to 5 hours of battery life. Mighty Audio offers a mobile app for iOS and Android that is used to wirelessly sync Spotify Music to the Mighty via the player‚Äôs Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Once the app is installed on your phone, the rest of the setup process takes about 10 minutes. That includes creating a Mighty account, renaming your device something only you will understand, connecting it to WiFi, downloading updates and linking your Spotify account. Once all of that is done, all you have to do is select which playlists to sync from Spotify to Mighty. Once the music is stored on Mighty, the user no longer needs a phone or Internet connection for music playback. Mighty has a 3.5mm headset jack and also works with Bluetooth headphones. Mighty makes Spotify mobile without using any of your phone's storage, battery or data.  History = Development = The company was founded by Anthony Mendelson, an ex- Google employee. The original Mighty was designed based on the idea that running or working out with a smartphone was not a great experience with no solution at the time to listen to streaming music outside of the phone. The product has also been called the ‚ÄúiPod Shuffle for Spotify‚Äù, especially as the Shuffle was discontinued by Apple. = Funding = Mighty Audio raised $300,101 through a Kickstarter campaign running from February 22, 2016 to March 23, 2016. The company followed this by raising an additional $295,702 on Indiegogo and sold an additional $300,000 in pre-orders from November 12, 2016 to June 23, 2016. The company raised a Friends and Family round of $125,000 in November 2015 and a seed round of $2M in February 2017. On February 1, 2018, it was announced that the company was part of the Techstars Music Class of 2018. = Release Delay = Although the release date of Mighty for its Kickstarter and Indiegogo backers was November 2016, the product was not released until July 2017. The company had to rebuild the product alongside Spotify and go through the Spotify certification process, which lasted 8 months.  Reception = Spotify = The device is currently limited to Spotify content and users with a Spotify Premium account. Mighty can only currently sync playlists, not albums or individual tracks. The workaround is to add albums or songs to a playlist and sync the playlist. = Shuffle = The device was met with criticism when it first launched as it did not have a shuffle feature. Shuffle functionality was added in September 2017 via a software update. = Connectivity = Users setting up their Mightys with the mobile app experienced connectivity issues. The company released software updates to address these connectivity issues. = Software Releases = The company released several minor software updates and a major 1.0 software update in September 2017. Items included in this update were shuffle functionality, aux cable support for speakers, improved battery life, connectivity stability fixes, the ability to sync individual playlists rather than everything loaded onto Mighty, and automatic playlist updates to the device, dubbed ‚ÄúStay Fresh‚Äù by the company.

He was Abbot from around 1294 to approximately 1307. His abbacy occurred at a time of tribulation for the abbey, mostly due to poor relations with the local populace.  Walter is in portrayed (perhaps unsurprisingly) in his Abbey's later chronicler in superlatives. He is described as \\"greatly venerable in life and always and everywhere devoted to God and the Blessed Virgin Mary\\" and as > A man of most beautiful appearance, as regards externals...and in good works > also he fought a good fight for Christ, for he used a hair shirt to conquer > the flesh, and by this discipline subdued it to the spirit. He rarely or > never ate meat. A chronicle of Vale Royal Abbey‚Äîprobably written in the 1330s‚Äîstates that the early abbots were under almost continual assault from a disgruntled populace. Abbot Walter spent much of his tenure defending the rights and prerogatives of his house (even, in 1302, securing the rights to all the dead wood on the ground within Peak Forest and at the same time petitioning parliament for the payment of arrears needed to pay for the ongoing works at the Abbey). The Abbey were granted the rights to hold a five-day long market and fair at their Kirkham manor in 1287. This was disputed by a member of the local gentry, Sir Theobald Butler, who claimed the hereditary grant of the church at Kirkham (and therefore all the associated rights and rents) from the time of King Richard I. Walter also requested that the King inform the Justices of the Eyre to aid the Abbey in its enforcement of its previous royal charters and successfully proved his Abbey's rights to the Kirkham fair and market before a commission of Quo Warranto. Abbot Walter also, for good measure, obtained from Otton de Grandson‚Äîthe English Ambassador to St Peter's‚ÄîPapal confirmation that the advowson of Kirkham was vale Royal's in perpetuity. As Peter Coss has said, however, even \\"the Abbey's own chronicler cast some doubt on the justice\\" of the original grant. Abbot Walter was also able to hold back an armed force that tried to force its way through the Abbey precinct. Abbot Walter continued to maintain the Abbey's claim to villeinage over the local tenantry as his predecessors had, for example in 1307, when one Richard Payne declared himself to be a freeman, and not a nativi of the Abbot as feudal lord. He also robustly defended his house against the King's own local Justiciar (whom the Abbey's chronicler labels a \\"tyrant\\") A mention of Walter in the Calendar of Fine Rolls confirms him to have been still living in November 1311, but as being by now a former Abbot.

Valenti shares personal stories recounting her childhood and adolescence regarding her treatment as a sex object and the pernicious influence of sexism in her daily encounters. She paints an image of an adult whose identify has been shaped by these experiences. Valenti argues that most women face a similar reality of being shaped by‚Äîand making everyday decisions to minimize‚Äîmale aggressions and sexual assault. Valenti was able to use Sex Object: A Memoir as a platform to focus on sharing experiences with readers, helping them understand how prevalent sexism is for young girls and women, and shedding light on the sheer size of this cultural problem. In addition to being an author, Valenti works professionally as a feminist writer, focusing on discussions of current events, and advocating for women's rights and transgender rights, including reproductive justice.  Publication history  Valenti published Sex Object on June 1, 2016 with Dey Street. Valenti selected the title despite fear of backlash, some of which came to fruition with the book's publication. Speaking to Emma Gray at HuffPost, Valenti said: > \\"People say, 'Oh you‚Äôre too ugly to call yourself a sex object' ‚Äî as if > calling yourself an object is a compliment, which completely misses the > point. But I decided that I can‚Äôt let harassers determine the content of the > book. At the end of the day, this is a book about objectification and > dehumanization. So that was the most accurate term.\\"  Summary  The 224-page book is divided in 21 chapters chronicling Valenti's encounters with street harassment and other forms of sexual assault, sexism, and poor treatment from sexual partners. Valenti promotes the idea that men can start mitigating women's daily experience of sexism by listening to women and believing their experiences.  Reception  Reviewing the book in The New Republic, Rafia Zakaria described the book's strength in Valenti's reappraisal of her own experience with objectification, including her prior blindness to the phenomenon; Zakaria compared Valenti's critical reassessment of her own experiences to Adrienne Rich's observation that for women \\"'revision‚Äîthe act of looking back, of seeing with fresh eyes, of entering an old text from a new critical direction is more than an act of cultural history; It is an act of survival.'

Already the author of four books, Valenti wrote the book during her first year of motherhood, after giving birth to her first child via C-section three months before her due date. The book discusses motherhood from Valenti's third-wave feminist perspective, diving into gender roles and increased individualism in parenting. The book was called \\"a politicized, anti-What to Expect When You're Expecting\\" by Publishers Weekly. It is Valenti's fifth book. Background Valenti got the idea to write the book while pregnant with her daughter in 2011. Two days after first discussing it with her editor, she was rushed to the hospital and delivered her daughter prematurely at just 28 weeks, the baby weighing just two pounds. The birth left Valenti with a sense of failure about not living up to the ideal of a healthy birth and a healthy baby.

Several variants have been developed using directed mutagenesis. The original was isolated from Discosoma, and named DsRed. Others are now available that fluoresce orange, red, and far-red. RFP is approximately 25.9 kDa. The excitation maximum is 558 nm, and the emission maximum is 583 nm. The first fluorescent protein to be discovered, green fluorescent protein (GFP), has been adapted to identify and develop fluorescent markers in other colors. Variants such as yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) were discovered in Anthozoa. Issues with fluorescent proteins include the length of time between protein synthesis and expression of fluorescence. DsRed has an maturation time of around 24 hours, which can make it unusable for many experiments that take place in a shorter time frame. Additionally, DsRed exists in a tetrameric form, which can affect the function of proteins to which it is attached. Genetic engineering has improved the utility of RFP by increasing the speed of fluorescent development and creating monomeric variants. Improved variants of RFP include mFruits (mCherry, mOrange, mRaspberry), mKO, TagRFP, mKate, mRuby, FusionRed, mScarlet and DsRed-Express.

Brief history During the Pre-Columbian era, the area was occupied by Sinagua people who built their dwellings in the cliffs of the Verde Valley Mountains between the years of 1100 and 1425 AD. In 1583, Captain Antonio de Espejo and the Spanish conquistadors took possession of the Verde Valley.Overview of the town of Camp Verde In the 1860s settlers began to migrate into the Verde Valley to work in the mining industry. The United States Army established a minor post overlooking the farms which the settlers established in West Clear Water. A post called Camp Lincoln, which later was renamed Camp Verde, was established.Camp Verde History By 1879, a number of families from the mid-western area of the United States arrived in the area. Among them was Charles D. Willard and his family. He named the area Cottonwood because there was a circle of sixteen large cottonwoods growing about one- quarter of a mile away from the Verde River. Willard, who founded the town, is considered to be the \\"Father of Cottonwood.\\" The area became a farming settlement.Cottonwood History Cottonwood also has a commercial district which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 (ref.#00000497) as the Cottonwood Commercial Historic District.

The guanzi (), was a Song dynasty era form of paper money that served as promissory notes that could be traded for goods and services where the seller that received these notes could go to an issuing agency and redeem the note for strings of coins at a small exchange fee. They were originally introduced as a form of payment to the military at which time the notes were known as jianqian guanzi (Ë¶ãÈå¢ÈóúÂ≠ê), and circulated alongside the contemporary jiaozi and huizi notes. After 1190 the records stop mentioning guanzi notes until 1264, an indication that jiaozi and huizi notes had superseded the guanzi in importance. From 1264 new guanzi notes were introduced such as the copper backed tongqian guanzi (ÈäÖÈå¢ÈóúÂ≠ê), the silver backed yinguan (ÈäÄÈóú), and the gold backed jinyin jianqian guanzi (ÈáëÈäÄË¶ãÈå¢ÈóúÂ≠ê), which were all introduced to combat the inflationary policy that had plagued the Huizi. The exchange rate between guanzi banknotes and copper cash coins was 1 gu√†n for 770 w√©n while huizi notes of the eighteenth production period were valued at 3 gu√†n for 1 w√©n. Despite these exchange rates the new guanzi banknotes did not stop the inflation that had plagued the Southern Song dynasty during its waning years. In the modern era not a single guanzi note survived regardless of the fact that many of them produced during the Southern Song era, in the modern era only the printing plates that were used to produce guanzi notes still exist and of the ten printing plates created by the Song government a total six are owned by the Administration Institute of Cultural Relics of Dongzhi County, two guanzi printing plates are in a private collection, and two of the printing plates have yet to be found. There were 5 different denominations of guanzi notes.  History  During the Tang dynasty there was a form of promissory notes known as jindai guanzi (ÈáëÂ∏∂ÈóúÂ≠ê) that were exclusively exchanged between the nobility but became a more common form of currency over time as the transportation of large strings of copper cash coins was considered troublesome as they were heavy. During the Southern Song dynasty the military were paid in guanzi banknotes that could be converted into cash coins at a fee of 10 w√©n per gu√†n. The guanzi notes mostly circulated in and around the capital city of Lin'an and were specifically made for Wuzhounese tea merchants. Members of the court sought to discourage the introduction of the Sichuanese Jiaozi because it wasn't backed by copper coins in sufficient numbers like the guanzi were, which is why after 1131 the guanzi, alongside the Huizi, would remain the paramount form of paper money in Southeast China. The central government had issued a number of guanzi valued at 800,000 m√≠n in 1159 which were planned to expire and be replaced after 3 years. The region of Huaidong had only printed 400,000 m√≠n in guanzi that were referred to as Gongju (ÂÖ¨Êìö) in 1159 but these already expired after 2 years.

After a distinguished career as a journalist, where she was honored with two Seprod Awards from the Press Association of Jamaica and as an officer in the Order of Distinction, Gloudon began working as a scriptwriter for the Little Theatre Movement (LTM) and writing radio drama. She hosted a radio talk show for thirty years and became chair of the LTM. Having received numerous awards and honors, Gloudon was granted the Order of Jamaica in 1992 and in 2012 became a fellow of the Institute of Jamaica. Early life Barbara Joy Goodison was born in Malvern, Saint Elizabeth Parish, Jamaica to Doris (n√©e Harvey) and Vivian M. Goodison. Her father worked as a chauffeur and mechanic and Goodison grew up in a middle-class family. One of her sisters became the first female Poet Laureate of Jamaica, Lorna Goodison. She attended St. George's Elementary School and went on to further her education at St Andrew High School for Girls in Kingston, as well as completing an international writing studies program at the University of Iowa. While in high school, she participated in theatrical performances and studied drama with Jean Watson. Career In 1953, Goodison began her career at The Gleaner newspaper, working as a reporter. Simultaneously, she also worked as a columnist, using the pseudonym \\"Stella\\" at the Jamaica Star. On 23 April 1960, Goodison married the chemist and food technologist, Ancile Gloudon a native of Port of Spain, Trinidad. The couple would subsequently have three children, Lisa, Jason and Anya and work together to build their first home. She would work as a features editor, editor and reporter at both The Gleaner and The Star until 1978. In 1964, the inaugural year of the Seprod Awards for Journalism, and again in 1968, Gloudon won recognition from the Press Association of Jamaica. One of the regular beats she covered was the arts and theater. Showing a particular talent for reporting on the cast, as well as the event, Gloudon was invited by the government to cover the art revolution in Britain in the 1960s. Upon her return to Jamaica, after nearly a month in the UK in 1969, Gloudon was invited by Greta Fowler, who with her husband Henry had founded Jamaica's Little Theatre Movement (LTM), to write a script for the annual pantomime production. Since the Americans had just landed a man on the moon, Gloudon wrote Moonshine Anancy. Selected for production, the piece marked a turning point in the LTM productions, as before Moonshine Anancy, they were more British than Jamaican. The first entry into the annual invited submission contest was followed by more than 30 scripts submitted for the National Pantomime event. She was honored as an officer in the Order of Distinction in 1975 for her journalistic services. Leaving journalism in 1978, Gloudon worked until 1981 as the director of the Jamaica Tourist Board and then opened her own public relations firm. From the late 1980s, she hosted a radio talk-show, Hotline, broadcast by Radio Jamaica Rediffusion (RJR 94 FM). The show focused on personal, local, and international problems in a thought-provoking commentary on cultural and social issues and Gloudon broadcast it until 2015. In addition to her broadcasting and writing, Gloudon traveled regionally discussing Caribbean themes, and specifically focused on the cultural and socio-economic concerns of women. In the 1990s, Gloudon became the chair of the LTM and directed the annual Boxing Day debut of the National Pantomime. In 1992, Gloudon was honored with the Order of Jamaica which was recognized at the Caribbean Media Awards ceremony hosted by the Caribbean Publishing and Broadcasting Association and Caribbean Broadcasting Union. She was elected as vice-chair of the International Programme for the Development of Communication in 1996 and served in that capacity until 1998, when she was elected IPDC's rapporteur. She was re-elected as rapporteur in 2000. Gloudon was awarded 2006 Gleaner Honour for her contributions to art and culture. In 2012, she and Sylvia Wynter were elected as fellows of the Institute of Jamaica, the organization in Jamaica which recognizes people who have distinguished themselves as representatives of the country's culture, history or science. Gloudon was inducted into the Jamaican Press Association Hall of Fame in 2013 and continues to write as a journalist for The Jamaica Observer in addition to her role at the LTM.

The float, named \\"Come Sail Away,\\" was modeled after the ship and contained trampolines and played upbeat music. On 18 July 2019, she completed her sea trials in the Adriatic Sea. On 29 October, Fincantieri officially presented Carnival Panorama to Carnival Cruise Line at the Marghera shipyard. To travel from Marghera to California for her christening and debut, Panorama embarked on a 38-day journey that took her across the Atlantic Ocean and through the Strait of Magellan to sail up the western coast of South America, making stops in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Montevideo, Santiago, and Puerto Vallarta. She arrived at her initial destination of the Port of Los Angeles in the early morning of 8 December for final preparations. On the afternoon of 9 December, Carnival Panorama moved to her home port, the Port of Long Beach, for her welcoming ceremonies and docked there for the first time early that evening. The ship was christened the following day by her godmother, Wheel of Fortune hostess Vanna White. Carnival Panorama is currently homeported at the Port of Long Beach. She embarked on her three-day inaugural voyage to Ensenada on 11 December 2019. Upon returning to Long Beach, she began sailing 7-day Mexican Riviera cruises to Cabo San Lucas, Mazatl√°n, and Puerto Vallarta on a year-round basis, taking over Carnival Splendor's itinerary. =COVID-19 pandemic= When Carnival Panorama returned to Long Beach on 7 March 2020, a female passenger was reported to be ill. As a result, the debarkation was halted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Long Beach Fire Department until the woman could be tested for COVID-19 at a nearby hospital. Initial reports stated that the ailing guest did not meet the criteria for coronavirus, but the CDC wanted to take \\"extra precautions\\". The CDC confirmed later in the evening that the guest tested negative for COVID-19, but the rest of the passengers spent the night onboard and disembarked the following morning. Due to the CDC holding Carnival Panorama one day late, her subsequent voyage was cut short to six days. The ship was returning from a trip to Mexico with scheduled stops at Cabo San Lucas, Mazatl√°n and Puerto Vallarta, which were also scheduled stops for Grand Princess during the previous month.https://book.princess.com/images/cc/brochure/downloads/hi-mex-cal-coast- brochure-2019-20-v2.pdf Carnival Panorama is the third Carnival ship (the others being the Australia-based Carnival Splendor and Carnival Spirit) to transport crewmembers back to their respective countries. She will be the only ship sailing from her homeport until April 2021, when Carnival Radiance will sail the itineraries previously served by Carnival Imagination and Carnival Inspiration.

The British government aimed to make savings of up to ¬£3 billion per year on current expenditure by 2015, primarily in the pre-construction phase. The report made a series of recommendations for changes in government procurement and planning. Cost savings were quickly realised and Infrastructure UK reported savings of ¬£1.5 billion at the end of the first reporting year and ¬£3 billion by 2014. The programme was projected to have saved ¬£50 billion in expenditure by the end of the 2010s. Infrastructure UK was absorbed into the Infrastructure and Projects Authority which launched its Transforming Infrastructure Performance in 2017 which aims to make ¬£15 billion in annual savings.  Background  The incoming Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government made a commitment in the June 2010 United Kingdom budget (dubbed an \\"emergency budget\\") to launch an investigation into how to reduce the cost of major infrastructures and to report back by the end of the year. The report was issued in December 2010. The government had committed to spending ¬£200 billion on infrastructure projects over the following five-year period.  Findings  The report showed that no single factor was driving excessive costs - though they were mainly incurred in the pre-construction phases - but rather a combination of factors: *Stop-start investment with a poor pipeline of guaranteed future works *Lack of clarity in planning and design decisions with projects often starting before design is complete *The perception that the contingency budget forms part of the overall budget and is available to spend *Over-specification and use of bespoke designed solutions rather than off-the-shelf products *Overly complicated bidding procedures *Lack of strategic thinking by the supply-chain *Lack of investment in skills and training The report showed that increasing fragmentation of the construction industry and a shift towards greater use of sub-contracting had also led to cost increases. The report writers considered that there was an opportunity to make savings of around 15% in infrastructure spending (¬£2-3 billion per year).  Objectives  The report set five objectives in an attempt to improve cost efficiency: *Publish a National Infrastructure Plan to provide forward visibility of work and continuity of investment *Provide for clear ownership of responsibility for key decisions in public sector management of projects *Allow for increased challenges to specifications and cost estimates, rather than accepting them upon submission *Allow procurement options to vary depending on the risk profile of the client *Allow for cost savings and value engineering for projects to be proposed by the industry  Reviews  The benchmarking process began in March 2011. At the time of the one-year review in March 2012 Infrastructure UK estimated that their measures had already saved ¬£1.5 billion. This included a 20% saving on 20 major projects being delivered by the Highways Agency and ¬£400 million saved on London Underground works. Commercial Secretary to the Treasury Lord Sassoon said: \\"Every pound saved through this Cost Review programme is a pound more that can be spent on new infrastructure for the UK\\". In 2013 Infrastructure UK claimed in a year which saw significant infrastructure projects being developed such as HS2 and the Thames Tideway Tunnel. An estimated 25% saving was made on Highways Agency and Environment Agency projects, 4.9% savings on the Network Rail renewals programme and more than ¬£1 billion on HS2 phase 1. The progress towards more collaborative behaviours was more notable in the rail, highways and water sectors than in energy, waste and telecoms. The final review period ending in 2014 showed annual savings on infrastructure spending and reached the target of ¬£3 billion. Infrastructure UK estimated that the efficiencies achieved as a result of the report would save the taxpayer more than ¬£50 billion in the following decade. Commercial Secretary to the Treasury, Lord Deighton stated that \\"The Infrastructure Cost Review programme has helped to establish a refreshed relationship and more open dialogue between government and industry. This has been a success for the third year running. However, we cannot be complacent. As the economy recovers, we will redouble our efforts to ensure that we have the necessary skills, capacity and innovation to embed cost and efficient delivery\\". The programme concluded in 2014 and Infrastructure UK was amalgamated with the Major Projects Authority in 2016 to form the Infrastructure and Projects Authority (IPA). The IPA launched the Transforming Infrastructure Performance report in 2015 aimed at saving ¬£15 billion annually in the industry.

Stark (born September 14, 1962) is an American archaeologist whose field experience and emphasis of studies have included locations in North America, the Near East and Southeast Asia. She is currently a professor of Southeast Asian Archaeology at the University of Hawai‚Äôi-Manoa, a position she has held since August 1995. Having first received her B.A. from the University of Michigan, she went on to complete her M.A and PhD from the University of Arizona. Stark has co-directed the Lower Mekong Archaeological Project (LOMAP), located in southern Cambodia for the past 12 years. Her research focus not only includes the various aspects of political economy, but also on the process of state formation. From 2000 until 2006, Miriam T. Stark edited the Asian Perspectives and from 2007 until present, she has directed the Luce Asian Archaeology Program, with funding from the Henry Luce Foundation Initiative in East and Southeast Asian Archaeology. Prior to her current research in Cambodian archaeology, Stark conducted ethnoarchaeological research in the Philippines. Miriam Stark has also conducted fieldwork in various locations such as Israel, New Mexico, Turkey and Thailand. Stark is a proponent of citizen science, or public support, for fieldwork and research conducted in various locales. She has been quoted as saying, \\"citizens become better stewards for our shared archaeological past by experiencing it directly. Archaeological fieldwork also requires many hands.\\"  Research = Cambodia = Beginning with her work co-directing the Lower Mekong Archaeological Project, in 1996, Stark has since conducted nine archaeological field seasons around Angkor Borei, between the years of 1996 and 2009. Her work actively blended research with student training, with over 50 students from various countries from Southeast Asia, including Cambodia, participating in the work. This work was centered on understanding why the Mekong Delta is critical to understanding Southeast Asian state formation. The Mekong Delta region was first noted in ancient Chinese accounts and may have been associated with the Funan kingdom. Stark stated that her goal in research conducted in this region was to \\"heighten public commitment to preserving the Cambodian archaeological heritage\\". Additionally, particularly in the Angkor Borei region, her goal was to better understand not only the impact of human beings on the landscape, but also political and economic organizations within the region. Beginning in 2010, Miriam T. Stark joined the third phase of research investigating what was deemed the ‚Äúdemise of Angkor‚Äù. This research project was conducted by the University of Sydney and was labeled as the Greater Angkor Project. The study examined occupational patterning in the Greater Angkor region and focused on locations such as the Angkor Wat temple. In both 2010 and 2012, Stark worked as a GAP III co-investigator in the Greater Angkor region, testing habitations in an attempt to determine residence of Angkorian and Post-Angkorian societies. Locations studied and tested included but were not limited to Angkor Wat, Ta Prohm, Wat Athvea, and Wat Prei Einkosei. Prior to this research, very little work had been done in regards to the study of residence in these regions. In 2013, more extensive work was done in the region with excavations conducted in and around Angkor Wat. This is of particular interest due to the utilization of LiDAR imaging to document the landscape. = Philippines = In 1987, Stark joined Bill Longacre's Kalinga Ethnoarchaeological Project, located in the Pasil municipality in the province of Kalinga, Philippines. There, she focused her study on the village of Dalupa, a moderately-sized village within Pasil with about 400 villagers. In Dalupa, the practice of pottery-making is a part-time specialization for its female inhabitants. Her work examined the uses, distribution, and production of the pottery across Kalinga as well as the social boundaries, household economies, and technological shifts in the lives of Kalinga's residents. This field-based research formed the basis of her doctoral dissertation work.  Projects = Lower Mekong Archaeological Project (LOMAP) = The Cold War turmoil from 1965 to 1989 damaged Cambodia's archaeological sites suffered and nearly destroyed the country's archaeological community. Archaeological research and historic preservation activities halted for several decades. As the violence concluded, restoration slowly restarted with the help of UNESCO, the World Monuments Fund, and specialists from around the world. Demand for local expertise in Cambodian archaeology was high, so training local Cambodian archaeologists for future generations has been integral to preserving Cambodia's archaeological heritage. The Lower Mekong Archaeological Project that Stark established with His Excellency Chuch Phoeurn (Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts, Kingdom of Cambodia) was a direct outgrowth of the University of Hawaii/East-West Center/Royal University of Fine Arts Cambodia Project initiated in 1994 by Dr. Judy Ledgerwood (then of the East-West Center and Dr. P. Bion Griffin (Department of Anthropology, University of Hawaii). Funding for the project was initially provided by the East-West Center, and the Cambodia project was envisioned as the foundation for long-term research programs by faculty from the University of Hawaii‚Äô that involve training graduates of the Royal University of Fine Arts (Phnom Penh) in archaeology, art history, cultural anthropology, and historic preservation. Training archaeology students has been a primary goal of the Royal University of Fine Arts (Phnom Penh) for more than a decade, since the temples of Angkor are the leading tourist attraction in Cambodia and the country lacks trained specialists to manage them. One of the many tragedies of the Khmer Rouge era was the disappearance of most of Cambodia‚Äôs archaeologists; it is said that only four trained archaeologists survived that era. They recognized the urgent need to train the next generation in archaeology to provide preservation specialists for the country‚Äôs archaeological heritage, and have actively sought international cooperating institutions to support this goal since the early 1990s. = Luce Asian Archaeology Program = Stark directs the Luce Asian Archaeology Program (LAAP) at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, which was launched in July 2008. The project is funded by The Henry Luce Foundation's Luce Initiative on East and Southeast Asian Archaeology and Early History as well as other participating entities of the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa. These include the Department of Anthropology, Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Art & Art History, American Studies, History, Asian Studies, and Center for Chinese Studies. The LAAP is primarily aimed toward helping archaeological professionals at the junior-level to develop the skills required for grant seeking and international collaborative research. The program has three specific objectives: to enhance the English skills of participating students, so it can lead to their international collaboration in the archaeological field; to provide archaeological training within the class setting to prepare students for a variety of subjects that enhance professional development; and to provide field experience after completing the academic training at the university through field training . A total of 12 East and Southeast Asian archaeologists participated in the LAAP from 2009-2012; many have continued their training in postgraduate archaeology programs internationally. = Greater Angkor Project III = From 2010 to 2014, Stark was involved with the Greater Angkor Project (GAP) Phase III, which was funded by the Discovery Project of the Australian Research Council. This project sought to investigate the habituation patterns of the Angkor civilization, which, as the capital of Khmer founded in the 9th century CE, was one of the world's biggest pre- industrial civilizations. The capital was abandoned around half a millennia ago; the period, rate, and processes of its collapse is largely unknown. Prior research had primarily focused on the inscriptions, monuments, and sculptures of Angkor; however, GAP III was focused more upon the habituation locations and well-known temple enclosures, including research done at Angkor Wat in 2013. The three objectives of the project are: # To identify the ancestry of Angkor's spatial and social organization in the first millennium BCE. # To explore how the Angkor urban complex operated. # To discover how, when, and why the region was abandoned, and to explore its transformations through the 16th and 19th centuries which resulted in the modern landscape seen today. =Khmer Production and Exchange= Miriam Stark has worked with colleagues Peter Grave, Lisa Kealhofer and Ea Darith since 2012 on the Khmer Production and Exchange Project, whose goal is to understand Angkorian political economy through studying the production and distribution of Khmer stoneware ceramics. Working with colleagues across projects to develop a robust sample of kiln- based and consumption-site stonewares that establishes a set of geochemical signatures for Angkorian kilns (production centers) against which to compare geochemical patterning in geographically discrete areas of the Angkorian state (consumption centers. Currently identified Angkorian kilns cluster in the hinterland of Angkor, in and around Kulen, in NE Thailand (in provinces just north of the Dangrek Mountains), and in the Phnom Penh region. Scholars agree that most major Angkorian provincial temples probably had associated kilns, from long-used ritual localities like Sambor Prei Kuk and major provincial centers like Phimai to secondary provincial temples. Ultimately our work should bring together geochemical, radiometric and vessel form information on Khmer stonewares and their kiln complexes.  Service = Community Service = Miriam Stark has also served on the Committee on the Status of Women in Archaeology for the American Anthropological Association from 1997-2000 as well as multiple roles for the Society of American Archaeology, including Committee on Meetings Development, Committee for Excellence in Archaeological Research and Analysis, and Board Member at Large. From 2013-2016, Stark served on the Cultural Heritage Policy Committee of the Archaeological Institute of America, which primarily based its focus on the area of Southeast Asia. The committee sought to stop global trafficking of illegal artifacts, particularly of pre-Angkorian and Angkorian art in Cambodia. She is a member of the Society for American Archaeology, the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association, Sigma Xi, Phi Beta Kappa, American Anthropological Association, American Women in Science, Archaeological Institute of America, and the American Association of University Women. She has facilitated training workshops in the US and in Cambodia since 2012 and organized sessions and symposia at major conferences for more than 25 years. She currently serves on eight editorial advisory boards for international journals and was an Archaeological Institute of America national lecturer twice (2013-1014, 2015-2016). Dr. Stark currently directs the University of Hawai'i's Center for Southeast Asian Studies. = Teaching = Stark serves as undergraduate advisor in the department of anthropology at the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa, and has served in university service roles for the UHM College of Social Sciences Research Council, UHM/CSEAS Foreign Language Area Fellowships Committee, and the UHM Center for Southeast Asian Studies Executive Board. She teaches introductory courses in the four field approach of anthropology, in addition to archaeological courses such as Archaeological Theory and Interpretation, and Landscape Archaeology. Her emphasis on Southeast Asia is present in courses such as Southeast Asian Archaeology, Asian Archaeology, and East Asian Archaeology. Miriam Stark advises graduate students as well as Ph.D candidates specializing in Southeast Asia, particularly in research involved in Cambodian and the Philippines. As recently as February 2018, Stark has conducted several lectures regarding Angkorian Khmers in the Mekong Delta at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), the University of Southern California (USC) and various other institutions. = Spreading the Research = Dr. Stark has made major contributions to Southeast Asian archaeology, so in order to spread the word, she gives lectures about her team's findings. Stark and her team have done extensive research in Angkor, and have actively gone out to teach others about what they have done. The following contains her research from recent lectures. She proposed that the Mekong Basin was a watery world, which lead to distinct patterns that made up everyday life there. The land surrounding the area where the Mekong River meets the sea, flooded for as long as four months per year. This led to the flooding of houses, which required rafts to provide transportation for the 17 million people who lived there. Due to salt water intrusion, farming was made difficult and nearly impossible. The Tonle Sap, another one of Cambodia‚Äôs major rivers connected to the Mekong River, also experienced floods over both its river and lake components. Despite Cambodia's monsoon filled climate, Stark claims that the discovery of speleothems are the first records of droughts existing in Cambodia. This discovery was long before the drought experienced in the present day region. Furthermore, the culture of these people considered water to be divine. They believed water management consisted of the belief that water came down from the source, and it was blessed by one of the gods (i.e. Shiva). Dr. Stark's research contains evidence that the Angkorian Khmers lived in, worshiped, and managed a watery world. More of Stark's research describes the cosmology of water became part of this region‚Äôs culture, thereby elevating the importance of this natural element in Angkor. The region had various religious practices regarding the use of water. Before Buddhism became the central religion, these practices included the washing of religious statues with perfume water, making offerings to the temple that resulted in the spiritual spray of water, and the belief in spirits from the lakes and rivers that were derived from animism. The reintroduction of the Khok Thlok origin story tells the story of the Naga Princess, also known as the serpent princess, and her marriage to a foreign prince after taking him to her underwater kingdom. This further highlights how important water was to the sacred origins of the Angkorian Khmers. Dr. Stark‚Äôs main project as of 2018 is the Greater Angkor Project and the epistemology that surrounds Angkor‚Äôs water system. She has described the 20 year process of making the Angkorian Urbanism Archaeological Map of Greater Angkor that has allowed archaeologists to understand urbanism and residential patterning in Southeast Asian states. Some of the information derived form this source is the possibility of low density urbanism, the widespread and long term rural settlement configuration with deep historical roots, and the presence of a hamlet based pattern centered on a prasat shrine in Angkor. Living situations have also been described as a systematic map of mounds and depressions where temples served as magnets with people living around them in order to support these sacred buildings. For example, the spirits housed in these temples had to be fed daily, thus the need for support staff to live nearby. Households were also organized around ponds, and these ponds were critical to the living experiences of those who called Angkorian Cambodia home. Additionally, to be a king in this historical region, Stark has stated that contenders had to be able to use water storage as a form of protection for the people and as a replication of the cosmos. Stark has found evidence for the reconstruction of the water system in this region that began in the 8th and 9th centuries. The Khmers began working with the rivers that already existed, and it eventually evolved into the 12th century elaborate manipulation of water. The manipulation included the use of moats to keep water away from the city.  Select publications = Articles = Murphy, Stephen A.; Stark, Miriam T.

He used his spare time to pursue his interest in paleontology, and authored or coauthored several important works on the geology and paleontology of France and Algeria. Life Pierre-Alphonse P√©ron was born on 29 November 1834 in Saint-Fargeau, Yonne. He attended the Coll√®ge d‚ÄôAuxerre for his secondary education, then in 1853 entered the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr. After graduating in 1855 he was posted to a series of different garrisons. He was assigned to Corsica in 1860, and later transferred to Algeria. In both places he was able to pursue his growing interest in geology, which absorbed much of his spare time for the rest of his life. In 1867 he was promoted to captain. During the Franco-Prussian War P√©ron was seriously wounded at the Battle of Sedan in September 1870. After recovering he was posted to Montauban, Tarn-et-Garonne, from 1871 to 1875. He was promoted to sub-intendant in 1875 and moved in turn to Reims (Marne), Toul (Meurthe-et-Moselle), Joigny (Yonne), Troyes (Aube) and then in 1883 to Bourges (Cher). He was sub-intendent from 1875 to 1890, then military intendent from 1890 to 1896. Alphonse P√©ron died on 2 April 1908 in Auxerre, Yonne, aged 73. Geology and paleontology Geological map of Corsica by P√©ron (1886) P√©ron's interest in geology and paleontology was kindled by fossils that he observed in Corsica in 1860. In Algeria he studied the geology around Aumale (Sour El-Ghozlane) and the Kabylie. In 1873 P√©ron contributed to the geological study of Tarn-et-Garonne. He went on to make observations of the Late Cretaceous formations of Southern France. P√©ron joined the first rank of gifted amateur geologists in France in the second half of the 19th century, others being √âdouard de Verneuil, Gustave Cotteau, Antoine Passy, Gustave Dollfus and Auguste Viquesnel(de). P√©ron collaborated with Victor-Auguste Gauthier in writing the Description des Echinides fossiles de l'Alg√©rie under the direction of Gustave Cotteau. This was a significant work, of which the first two chapters were published in the Annales des Sciences g√©ologiques (1873) and in the Biblioth√®que des Hautes √©tudes (1875). They were subsequently revised in 1883‚Äì84 to form part of the first volume of this great work. From 1873 to 1891 Gauthier worked constantly on the descriptions of the Algerian fossil Echinidae for which Peron provided most of the materials, wrote the stratigraphic notes and collaborated with Gauthier on some of the descriptions. Cotteau retained overall responsibility and his opinion prevailed in questions of interpretations of genera and species and in general classification. In 1852 the Mines department was charged with drawing a geological map of the three Algerian provinces. The map of Algiers Province by Ludovic Ville was ready for the Exposition Universelle of 1867, as was the map of Oran Province, and Jules Tissot's map of Constantine Province was exhibited at Vienna in 1873. New versions of the maps were presented at the Exposition Universelle of 1878. The idea of a general geological map of Algeria was floated in 1881, when the Association fran√ßaise pour l'avancement des sciences met in Algiers. P√©ron's 202-page Essai d'une description g√©ologique de l'Alg√©rie (1883) was thus the culmination of thirty years of work. In 1902 the Ministry of Education proposed that Georges Rolland should write up the results of the Tunisian Scientific Exploration Mission (1885‚Äì86), but he refused for health reasons. The task was given to Philippe Thomas, who was now in retirement. He wrote the Essai d'une description g√©ologique de la Tunisie with the support of Jean Albert Gaudry, Alphonse P√©ron and Paul Bursaux, technical director of the Compagnie des phosphates de Gafsa. The first part, an Overview of physical geography, was published in 1907. The second part, Stratigraphy of the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic terrains, was published in 1908. P√©ron was President of the Soci√©t√© g√©ologique de France (SGF) in 1905.

He lived for most of his life in Manchester, England, where he immersed himself in the radical politics prevalent there at the time.  Early life  William McKerrow was born on 7 September 1803. His parents were William and Elizabeth McKerrow, both of whom were very involved with the United Secession Church, which was a small sect formed from a schism of the wider Presbyterian church. He was schooled at Kilmarnock Academy and then attended the University of Glasgow between 1817 and 1823. In 1821, he had joined the Divinity Hall of the United Secession Church and in 1826 he was licensed to preach. A year later, in May, he moved to Manchester to take a position in the Lloyd Street Presbyterian chapel, with which he remained associated for the rest of his life. He was ordained on 7 September 1827.  Church work  McKerrow did much to bring together the Presbyterian church in Manchester and the surrounding areas. He assisted in the foundation of several new churches and also in the creation of the Lancashire presbytery in 1831, as well as in the subsequent establishment of the United Presbyterian Church in 1847. Later, in 1863, he was involved in forming the English synod of that church, of which he served as moderator in 1866‚Äì1867, and later still he had involvement in the 1876 union from which emerged the Presbyterian Church of England. McKerrow acted as moderator of this latter organisation in 1877‚Äì1878. In addition to these efforts, he also had a significant role in the move of the Lloyd Street Chapel congregation to new premises on Brunswick Street, from which base it became, according to biographer Ian Sellers, \\"one of Manchester's most influential churches.\\"  Social and political work  Sellers says that McKerrow was \\"moved by a sense of political and social injustice\\", perhaps inspired by the environs of Lloyd Street Chapel, which occupied a site in a deprived area opposite Manchester Town Hall. In 1834, following an argument with Hugh Stowell, an evangelical cleric of the Church of England with whom he had disagreed in the columns of the Manchester Courier and Manchester Times newspapers, McKerrow helped form the United Committee of Manchester Dissenters. He was later involved in the establishment of the Manchester Voluntary Church Association in 1839, which was initially based at Lloyd Street Chapel and went on to support Edward Miall and The Nonconformist newspaper. Aside from these church-related organisations. McKerrow was prominent locally in organising a campaign for the civil registration of births, marriages and deaths in 1837. He was also among the seven founders of the Manchester Anti-Corn Law Association in 1838, all but one of whom were members of his congregation. During the earlier part of the 1840s, McKerrow campaigned against proposals in Sir James Graham's 1843 Factory Education Bill and also against the Maynooth Grant. He was among the co-founders of the Manchester Examiner newspaper in 1846, with his colleagues including Thomas Ballantyne, John Bright, Alexander Ireland, and Edward Watkin. This newspaper was intended to promote the radical ideas of Manchester Liberalism which were less favoured by the more mainstream Manchester Guardian. Later in the 1840s, McKerrow was involved with the Peace Society and the United Kingdom Alliance. He was among the founders of the Lancashire Public School Association in 1847, which also began in the Lloyd Street Chapel building and in December 1850, with the assistance of Richard Cobden, became a national body. Other involvements in educational matters included promotion of a model secular school in Jackson's Row, Manchester, and in 1853 he gave evidence on education to a parliamentary committee. He also took part in deputations to parliament. He had been awarded the degree of D.D. by the University of Heidelberg in 1851. In 1857, McKerrow stood in for Cobden, who was ill, to lead the unsuccessful election campaigns of Bright and Milner Gibson, both of whom were radicals and pacifists. His lectures in 1861 for the Liberation Society, which campaigned for dis-establishment of the Church of England, led to a row with James Bardsley of the Manchester Church Defence Association and in the early years of the same decade he was involved with local relief efforts necessitated by the cotton famine. McKerrow semi-retired from his church work in 1869 and resigned his pastorate in 1871, having moved to Bowdon, Cheshire, in 1870. Around this time, he was a member of the Manchester Education Aid Society and in 1870 he was elected to the Manchester school board as an \\"unsectarian\\" candidate. He was re-elected in 1873 and 1876. He also established a scholarship to enable board-school children to attend secondary schools, funding it with money given to him at a dinner celebrating his jubilee in the ministry.  Personal life  McKerrow married Anne, daughter of John Begg of Rusholme, Manchester, on 6 March 1829. Having borne him eight children, she died in 1863. McKerrow himself died on 4 June 1878 in Bowdon of congestion of the lungs and was buried at Ardwick cemetery in Manchester. Among his children were the Reverend James Muir McKerrow, who wrote a biography of his father, and John Begg McKerrow, who became an alderman of Salford. The Shakespeare scholar and bibliographer Ronald Brunlees McKerrow was among his grandchildren.

The epicenter was on the coastline near Hualien, which was the most severely affected area, with a maximum felt intensity of VIII (severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale. At least 17 deaths were reported, with 285 injured. The maximum foreshock was recorded on 4 February 2018, at 21:56:40. The epicenter was located at Hualien County, Taiwan, reaching a scale of ML 5.8. Tectonic setting Taiwan has a history of many strong earthquakes. The island is located within a complex zone of convergence between the Philippine Sea Plate and Eurasian Plate. At the location of the earthquake, these plates converge at a rate of 75 mm per year. To the south of Taiwan, oceanic crust of the Eurasian Plate is subducting beneath the Philippine Sea Plate creating an island arc, the Luzon Arc. At Taiwan the oceanic crust has all been subducted and the arc is colliding with continental crust of the Eurasian Plate. To the north of Taiwan the Philippine Sea Plate is in contrast subducting beneath the Eurasian Plate, forming the Ryukyu Arc. Earthquake The earthquake formed the largest of a sequence of events that have affected the area over a period of days, with 11 foreshocks of M 4.6 and greater, starting on 3 February with an M 4.8 earthquake and including an M 6.1 event on 4 February, within a few kilometres of the event that took place on 6 February. 6 February earthquake was a result of oblique- slip faulting. The earthquake occurred on the second anniversary of the 2016 Taiwan earthquake in Tainan that had killed 117 people. The earthquake was followed by a series of aftershocks, with the largest being an M 5.7 event on 7 February at 23:21 local time, 19 km northeast of Hualien city, which reached a maximum intensity of VI (strong).

Aftermath President Tsai Ing-wen (center) inspects a collapsed building and addresses the press in Hualien City. = Casualties = As of 11 February 17 people were reported dead and a further 285 injured. Of the reported fatalities, 9 were from People's Republic of China, 5 from Taiwan, 2 from Hong Kong of Canadian nationality, and 1 from the Philippines. 14 of them were in The Yun Men Tsui Ti building. = Damage = Many buildings in the city of Hualien were damaged, including four that had partially collapsed or were severely damaged. The lower floors of the Marshal Hotel collapsed, killing two people. 14 deaths were also reported from the twelve-story Yun Men Tsui Ti residential building, which was severely tilted due to the collapse of some of the lower floors. Large beams were placed by cranes on one side of the building in an effort to prevent further tilting during the continuing rescue efforts. Many homes were left without water. Bridges and highways remaining closed due to damage from the earthquake. Hundreds of firefighters and military personnel stayed onsite to support efforts to rescue people trapped in damaged buildings. = International response = Humanitarian aid sent by a C-130 Hercules of the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) to Hualien Airport after the earthquake. The Taiwanese government said that several countries offered to provide aid following the earthquake but stated that it had to \\"politely decline\\" such offers, including an offer from People's Republic of China reasoning that Taiwan has no shortage of relief workers and supplies. It decided to accept a Japanese contingent since they possess body- heat detection equipment, a technology Taiwanese authorities do not possess. The Japanese specialized rescue team arrived on 9 February to provide assistance for the search efforts. The Japanese team was the first international search-and-rescue team to arrive in Taiwan.

It is the only species in the monotypic genus Cryptoteuthis one of the cirrate octopuses of the family Opisthoteuthidae, the umbrella octopuses. It is known from a single specimen which was collected in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. It has characteristics which are shared with two other genera in the Opisthoteuthidae, Opisthoteuthis and Grimpoteuthis, but is sufficiently distinctive from either of these to warrant the erection of a new genus. Description Cryptoteuthis brevibracchiata is a bell-shaped octopus with a semi-gelatinous, semi-transparent body, except for the dark tips of the oral web and the tipes of the fins. The fins are small and round, and their length is equal to half the width of the head. It has short arms, each with a single row of small, broad suckers and with a double row of cirri which are of moderate length, with each cirrus just longer than the diameter of the suckers. The longest arm has 48 suckers and the web is around half the length of the arms. The eyes are laterally positioned and the optic nerve passes through the white body in a single bundle. There are no posterior salivary glands, radula or ink sac. The digestive gland is entire. It has a simple U-shaped shell. The gills have 7 primary lamellae. The mantle length 35 mm and the total length is 121mm. Distribution and habitat Cryptoteuthis brevibracchiata was described from a single specimen, an immature female, collected in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean near the Porcupine Seabight at 49¬∞54 N, 12¬∞21 W from a depth of between 2,274 and 2,300m, south west of Ireland.

Oakland Museum of California Art, 2003, He was a driving force of the Bay Area art scene from the mid 1950s until his recent retirement from the San Francisco Art Institute. In addition to his artistic practice, Martin is widely known for his work as a longtime administrator and Professor Emeritus at the San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI).  Early life and education  Fred Martin was born in 1927 in San Francisco, California, where his parents lived in an apartment on Geary Street. His father was an electrical engineer, his mother a homemaker. A year after his birth, the family moved to nearby Alameda, and later to Oakland, where he attended school. In his final year of high school, Martin decided to major in Decorative Art at University of California, Berkeley after a teacher determined his interests were more creative than scientific, although he originally hoped to pursue a degree in Physics. It was during this time that he was first exposed to ancient Chinese art and visual culture, which have deeply influenced his own art.Martin, Fred. \\"Chronology as a Catalog Essay, Part One,\\" Oakland: Green Gates Press, 2017. Martin received a Bachelor of Art degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1949, at a time when painters Sam Francis and Jay DeFeo were also students in the art department. There, he studied with painter and theorist Erle Loran and WPA era painter Ray Scepter Boynton. Between 1949 and 1950, Martin studied with David Park, in addition to Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still, who were visiting instructors, at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute). He returned to UC Berkeley a few years later and obtained a Master of Art degree in 1954.Foley, Suzanne. \\"Fred Martin: Paintings Collages, Drawings, Prints\\". San Francisco Museum of Art, 1973.  Arts administrator career  Shortly after completing his graduate education, Martin was hired as the registrar of the Oakland Museum of Art, where he was also enlisted to help with various installation tasks. During his time there, he informally helped build its world-renowned collection of California art, and encouraged then director Paul Mills to identify and exhibit a school of local artists. Martin suggested his friends David Park, Elmer Bischoff and several other artists, who Mills eventually grouped together as leaders of the Bay Area Figurative Movement in a historic 1957 exhibition.Tooker, Dan. \\"Dan Tooker Interviews Fred Martin\\". Art International Volume XIX/9, November 20, 1975. In 1958 Martin became the Director of Exhibitions at the San Francisco Art Institute, where he oversaw the Art Bank, an innovative, membership-based initiative that supported the work of several generations of artists in the Bay Area. Assembling the works of painters, sculptors, and printmakers, including Otis Oldfield, David Park, Richard Diebenkorn, Bruce Conner, Joan Brown, Jay DeFeo, and Wally Hedrick, Martin organized exhibitions of Bay Area artists at local and national galleries and museums between 1958 and 1965.Aukenman, Anastasia. \\"Welcome to Painterland: Bruce Connor and the Rat Bastard Protective Association\\". University of California Press, 2016. In addition to serving as Director of Exhibitions at the San Francisco Art Institute between 1958-1965, Martin was Director of the College between 1965-1975; Dean of Academic Affairs between 1983-1992; and Vice President and Dean of Academic Affairs Emeritus 1992-2016. Martin's decades-long tenure at SFAI has placed him at the center of the Bay Area Art scene as an influential artist and mentor.Villa, Carlos. \\"Interview with Fred Martin\\". http://rehistoricizing.org/fred-martin/,  Artistic style  When Martin began painting in the late 1940s, he used oil paint or house paint to create semi-abstracted scenes based on real and imagined imagery. At times these works ventured into action painting; other works, however, were created with a Chinese sumi brush, and focused more on calligraphic brushstrokes as figures and objects developed among various textures. Writing on Martin's work in a 1973 SFMoMA catalog, curator Suzanne Foley notes that his artistic style developed as he was studying with David Park, who emphasized \\"compositional simplicity\\", while also receiving \\"the greatest direction\\" from the \\"'beat' ambiance\\" of the time, which spoke to \\"Fred Martin's sensitivity\\".Foley, Suzanne, \\"Fred Martin: Paintings, Collages, Drawings, Prints\\". San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, 1973. Martin's work reflects his broad and diverse range of interests, including Jungian psychology. Over the years, much of his art has contained autobiographical details often in the form of symbols or anthropomorphic imagery. Poppies, for example, represent his first wife, Jean, who was also an artist, while grain, seeds, and phallic symbols allude to regeneration.China Academy of Art Museum. \\"The Art Works and Note Books of Fred Martin\\". CAA Art Museum, 2016.  Partial bibliography = Artist's books = Throughout his career, Martin has often incorporated text in his paintings, drawings, collages, and lithographs. At times, these experiments have led to limited edition artist's books such as: *Belulah Land (San Francisco: Crown Point Press, 1966). According to Martin, this book of etchings is titled after the place where \\"the good go to wait outside heaven\\" in John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress *Log of the Sun Ship (San Francisco: Crown Point Press, 1969) *Liber Studiorum, (Oakland, Green Gates Press, 1973) *A Travel Book (San Francisco: Arion Press, 1976) *From an Antique Land (Oakland: Green Gates Press, 1979) = Art criticism and writing = In addition to creating artist's books, Martin worked as a columnist for ARTWEEK magazine, where he was a consulting editor from 1976-92. He began writing on art early on in his career. In the 1960s, for example, he contributed reviews, features, and essays for leading art periodicals like Artforum, Art International, and Art Journal. Throughout his career as an arts administrator and educator, Martin also supported other Bay Area artists by writing on their works for various publications, and continues to be cited by curators and researchers who are revisiting the region's twentieth-century artistic circles.Nadel, Dan. \\"Karma Presents Works By Four Bay Area Artists\\". Karma New York, 2017. For instance, Martin wrote on Wally Hedrick's work for an exhibition catalog coinciding with his show at Pavilion Gallery (1967) and later contributed the main essay for the book published in conjunction with Jay DeFeo's 1969 exhibitions at the Pasadena Art Museum and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.Martin, Fred. \\"Jay DeFeo: The Rose\\" Pasadena Art Museum, 1969.  Howl reading and the Six Gallery  In the late 1950s, Martin was loosely associated with a group of artists who were living and working in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco such as Jay DeFeo and Wally Hedrick, who were married, Joan Brown, Manuel Neri, Bernice Bing, and Deborah Remington. In 1954 Hedrick and Remington co-founded the Six Gallery, with four other artists and poets. A year later, Martin was invited to exhibit there. His first solo show of three at the independent art space included mixed-media abstract sculptures that poet and Six Gallery co- founder Michael McClure described as \\"pieces of surrealist furniture,\\" miniature oil paintings on masonite, and a few larger paintings.Solnit, Rebecca. Secret Exhibition: \\"Six California Artists of the Cold War Era,\\" San Francisco: City Light Books, 1990. While Martin's exhibition was on view, the gallery hosted an evening of Beat poets, including Allen Ginsberg, who debuted his seminal poem Howl. Martin's paintings had been taken down for the night but his sculptures remained on the makeshift stage where each poet read. According to writer Rebecca Solnit, who interviewed Martin, the tiny paintings were in response to \\"his feeling that making large-scale paintings was too much like painting walls.\\" Martin's small-scale paintings were priced between 50 cents and $1.50, and DeFeo wrote the prices on the back of each painting. Several of his friends, David Park, Elmer Bischoff, Joan Brown, and Manuel Neri, among others, purchased works from the show.

Research  Udry's research concentrates on economic activities in rural Sub-Saharan settings, with a particular emphasis on rural financial markets in developing countries. According to IDEAS/RePEc, he belongs to the top 2% of most cited economists. Udry's most cited research includes the following findings: = The use of credit as insurance in rural credit markets= Contrary to prevailing wisdom about credit markets in developing countries, which predicts these markets to be affected by moral hazard and adverse selection because of incomplete contracts and imperfect information, Udry finds information asymmetries between borrowers and lenders to be unimportant in rural credit markets in northern Nigeria, with information flowing freely between communities. By extension, the standard instruments used to address moral hazard and adverse selection in financial systems - collateral and interlinked contracts - are largely absent. Instead, households use credit as a form of insurance: by finetuning the repayment of loans to compensate for random production shocks affecting the borrower and/or the lender, households are able to pool risks. For example, if a borrower's household experiences an income shortfall in a given month due to e.g. an income earner being sick, the debtor household will reduce its monthly repayment.Udry, C. (1990). Credit Markets in Northern Nigeria: Credit as Insurance in a Rural Economy. World Bank Economic Review, 4(3), pp. 251-269.Udry, C. (1994). Risk and Insurance in a Rural Credit Market: An Empirical Investigation in Northern Nigeria. Review of Economic Studies, 61(3), pp. 495-526. = Consumption smoothing with agricultural assets= How do farm households address the risk of income fluctuations and smooth their consumption? In northern Nigeria, Udry finds that households react to harvest shortfalls on their upland farm plots by selling their grain stocks (rather than their livestock) and prepare for such adverse shocks expected to occur in the near future by increasing their current saving.Udry, C. (1995). Risk and Saving in Northern Nigeria. American Economic Review, 85(5), pp. 1287-1300. Similarly, Udry (with Marcel Fafchamps and Katherine Czukas) finds that, unlike hypothesized by the academic literature, livestock plays only a minor role in Burkinab√© households' consumption smoothing, as livestock sales compensate only ca. 15-30% of the shortfall in household income attributable to village-level shocks such as droughts.Fafchamps, M., Udry, C., Czukas, K. (1998). Drought and saving in West Africa: are livestock a buffer stock? Journal of Development Economics, 55(2), pp. 273-305. More particularly, Udry finds (with Harounan Kazianga) that rural Burkinab√© households appear to have been generally unable to effectively buffer their consumption against drought in 1981-85, with standard risk-coping strategies such as risk sharing and the use of assets as buffer stocks being either absent or insufficient.Kazianga, H., Udry, C. (2006). Consumption smoothing? Livestock, insurance and drought in rural Burkina Faso. Journal of Development Economics, 79(2), pp. 413-446. = The adoption and diffusion of agricultural technologies= How do farmers learn about a new agricultural technology? Studying the adoption of pineapple farming - which requires carefully calibrated agricultural inputs - in Ghana, Udry and Timothy Conley argue that farmers' adoption of pineapple farming displays social learning based on the finding that farmers imitate the input settings of those farmers in their \\"information neighbourhood\\" that have been surprisingly successful in earlier seasons. In line with the hypothesis that social learning is only displayed in the context of adopting new farming technologies, farmers don't adjust their farming inputs to imitate successful the settings of successful \\"information neighbours\\" for crops like cassava or maize whose farming technologies are established and well-known.Conley, T., Udry, C. (2001). Social Learning Through Networks: The Adoption of New Agricultural Technologies in Ghana. American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 83(3), pp. 668-673.Conley, T.G., Udry, C.R. (2010). Learning about a New Technology: Pineapple in Ghana. American Economic Review, 100(1), pp. 35-69. Financially, the diffusion of pineapple farming in Ghana is driven by real rates of return ranging from 205-350% per year compared to 30-50% in maize or cassava farming; these high rates of return, coupled with an average rate of return in Ghana's overall informal sector that Udry and Santosh Anagol find to be close to 60% further substantiates the Lucas puzzle, i.e. why capital tends to flow from developing countries to developed countries despite the former having far higher rates of return than the latter.Udry, C., Anagol, S. (2006). The Return to Capital in Ghana. American Economic Review, 96(2), pp. 388-393. = Efficiency of the allocation of production inputs within households = Is households' agricultural production efficient, i.e. do households efficiently allocate their agricultural inputs (labour, fertilizer, etc.) across farm plots depending on its fertility? In many African households, different household members each control and farm distinct plots. Using detailed agronomic data on the inputs and returns of farm plots in rural Burkina Faso, Udry et al. document substantial inefficiencies in the allocation of agricultural production factors across plots controlled by different household members, which bear substantial implications for the design of agricultural policy in developing countries.Udry, C. et al. (1995). Gender differentials in farm productivity: Implications for household efficiency and agricultural policy. Food Policy, 20(5), pp. 407-423. Udry estimates the output losses that are due to these inefficiencies to amount to ca. 6% of total household production. Most importantly, these inefficiencies suggest that not only the assumption of a unitary household model but even the (less restrictive) assumption of an efficient intrahousehold allocation of production factors is likely misleading, possibly because even decisions within households may be substantially affected by imperfect information or transaction costs.Udry, C.R. (1996). Gender, Agricultural Production, and the Theory of the Household. Journal of Political Economy, 104(5), pp. 1010-46. = Risk as a determinant of agricultural investments = Investigating why small-scale farmers in developing countries fail to invest in activities with high expected returns such as the purchase and application of chemical fertilizer, Udry, Karlan, Osei and Osei-Akoto design an experiment in northern Ghana wherein farmers are randomly assigned to receive cash grants, opportunities to purchase or receive for free rainfall-indexed insurance, or a combination of the two. By contrast to the cash grant's small effect on agricultural investment, they find a strong demand for the insurance product and moreover observe that farmers are willing and able to invest into their farms even without the help cash grants if they are offered insurance; they thus conclude that the binding constraint on agricultural investment is uninsured risk, which can be catastrophic for farmers, and not a lack of liquidity. By extension, this implies that agricultural credit policies are unlikely to be effective in stimulating agricultural investment. Finally, Karlan et al. also show that even though there is sufficient demand to sustain a market for rainfall insurance in rural Ghana, a lack of trust, recency bias and the absence of payouts due to favourable rainfalls may erode participation in insurance markets despite its high benefits.Karlan, D. et al. (2014). Agricultural Decisions after Relaxing Credit and Risk Constraints. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 129(2), pp. 597-652. In another study, which analyses the impact of ambiguous and contested land rights on agricultural investment and productivity in Akuapim-Mampong, Ghana, Christoher Udry and Markus Goldstein find that investments into the fertilization of land plots and, by consequence, these plots' productivity mirror the strength of the tenure rights of the individuals in control of the different plots. In turn, the strength of an individual's tenure rights with regard to a given plot of land depends on the individual's rank in the local political hierarchy.Goldstein, M., Udry, C. (2008).
