The Howeitat lived in what is now Saudi Arabia/Jordan. Auda was a significant figure in the Arab Revolt; outside Arabia he is mainly known through his portrayal in British Col. T. E. Lawrence's account Seven Pillars of Wisdom, and from the partly fictionalised depiction of him in David Lean's film Lawrence of Arabia. The Howeitat Lawrence recorded that the Jazi Howeitat had formerly been under the leadership of the House of Rashid, the amirs of Ha'il, but had since fragmented and that Auda had come to control the Eastern Howeitat, known as the abu Tayi.Lawrence, T. E. The Howeitat and their Chiefs , Arab Bulletin report of 24 July 1917, from telawrence.net Auda had taken up the claims of his father, Harb abu Tayi (? – 1904), who had contested the tribe's chieftainship with Arar ibn Jazi.Peake, F. A History of Jordan and its Tribes, University of Miami Press, 1958, p.212 Auda and his ibn Jazi rival, Arar's half-brother Abtan, diverted the energies of the Howeitat—previously settled farmers and camel herders—into raiding, greatly increasing the tribe's wealth but introducing a mainly nomadic lifestyle.Alon, Y. and Eilon, J. The Making of Jordan: Tribes, Colonialism and the Modern State, Tauris, 2007, , p.34. Lawrence (in his report above) stated that the Howeitat were \\"altogether Bedu\\", but they had in fact only recently abandoned farming for nomadism. Tensions between them and the Ottoman administration had increased after an incident in 1908, when two soldiers were killed who had been sent to demand payment of a tax that Auda claimed to have already paid.Fischbach, M. State, Society, and Land in Jordan, BRILL, 2000, , p.48. Auda claimed that the troops were shot when they opened fire on him. Life Auda abu Tayi is considered a hero of the Arab revolt. For while Prince Faisal was the prophet of Islam, Auda was the warrior.Lawrence, Seven Pillars, p.169 T.E. Lawrence romanticized him as someone who epitomized everything noble, powerful and proud about the Bedouin, \\"the greatest fighting man in northern Arabia\\", with an impressive lineage of many generations of great desert Howeitat warriors of the Arabian peninsula. Lawrence wrote that > \\"He saw life as a saga, all the events in it were significant: all > personages in contact with him heroic, his mind was stored with poems of old > raids and epic tales of fights.\\"The Seven Pillars of Wisdom by T.E. > Lawrence, As was customary in the desert Auda was known for his hospitality and generosity which \\"kept him always poor, despite the profits of a hundred raids\\". He claimed he had been married 28 times and wounded more than a dozen times in action. Legend had it that he had killed 75 Arabs by his own hand; he didn't even bother to keep count of the Turks. In battle Auda became a wild beast assuaged only after he had killed.https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/auda.html He was hot- headed but always kept a smile on his face. Despite his fierce reputation he was described as modest, direct, honest, kind-hearted and warmly-loved. Auda lived in the desert near the Hejaz railway. He preferred the isolation which became necessary after he killed one too many debt collectors from Constantinople and the Turks put a price on his head. The desert landscapes were the exact areas Faisal and Lawrence needed to operate in to avoid close attention from the Turks. Lawrence wrote: > \\"Only by means of Auda abu Tayi could we swing the tribes from Ma'an to > Aqaba so violently in our favour that they would help us take Aqaba and its > hills from their Turkish garrisons.\\" The Arab Revolt Auda's tribesmen were reputedly the finest fighters in the desert, which is why his support and assistance were vital to the Arab Revolt. Auda had initially been in the pay of the Ottoman Empire, but switched allegiance to Lawrence and Faisal bin Al Hussein. With the incentives of kicking the Turks out of Arabia, and the lure of gold and booty, Auda joined the Arab Revolt, becoming a fervent supporter of the Arab independence movement (apparently going so far as to smash his Turkish false teeth with a hammer to demonstrate his patriotism). He was repeatedly approached by the Turks with further financial inducements if he would switch to their side, but he refused to go back on his word. He was an Arab patriot and he would ride with Lawrence. He and his tribesmen were instrumental in the fall of Aqaba (July 1917) and Damascus (October 1918). Post-war years After the collapse of the Arab government in Damascus, Auda retired to the desert, building a modern palace at Al-Jafr east of Ma'an with captured Turkish slave labour. Before it was complete, however, he died in 1924 of natural causes; he is buried in Ras al-Ain, Amman, Jordan. His granddaughter, Maryam Abu Tayi, is a historian professor in Jordan. Portrayal in film and media He was portrayed in the David Lean film Lawrence of Arabia by Anthony Quinn as a complex character who blends together paternal wisdom and desert piracy. The depiction of Auda as interested only in financial rewards has been criticised, however, as he was a genuine supporter of Arab independence and was closely involved in planning the Revolt's military actions. Whatever the real motivations of Auda Abu Tayi, much of his presentation seems rooted in his sensationalised depiction by Lowell Thomas (and to an extent by Lawrence himself) as a figure of anarchic, primitive masculine energy deliberately set against the idea of British 'civilisation' (see also Orientalism).Dawson, Soldier Heroes: British Adventure, Empire, and the Imagining of Masculinities, Routledge, 1997, , p.184 Auda's descendants were so incensed by the portrayal of their ancestor that they sued Columbia Studios, the film's producers; the case was eventually dropped.Turner, Adrian, Robert Bolt: Scenes From Two Lives, pp. 201–206 Auda was also featured as a supporting character in Terence Rattigan's Lawrence-themed play Ross. The portrayal of Auda here is generally more well-rounded than in the film; he is shown to be a true Arab patriot, although he still retains fondness for financial reward. As Faisal and the film's fictional Sherif Ali were not present in the play, he served as the primary Arab character. He is also portrayed in 2009 Qatari film Auda abu Tayeh, which talks about his life in Arabia to Arab Revolt, and his death. Lawrence on Auda When Lawrence attended Prince Faisal's camp at Wejd, he arrived late on February 16, 1916, bursting into the conference hall. > \\"Auda was very simply dressed, northern fashion, in white cotton with a red > Mosul head-cloth.

It ran from South Hampstead, through Marylebone and Soho (St Anne's, Westminster) then ran through St James's parish/district and Green Park to meet the tidal Thames at four sites, grouped into pairs. These pairs were near Whitehall Stairs (east of Downing Street) and by Thorney Street, between Millbank Tower and Thames House. Its much smaller cousin the Tyburn Brook was a tributary of the Westbourne, in turn the next Thames tributary (west, on the north bank). A charter of AD 959 appears to mention the river, which it refers to as Merfleot, which probably translates as Boundary Stream, a suggestion reinforced by context, with the river forming the western boundary of the estate described.Citadel of the Saxons, the Rise of Early London. Rory Naismith, p131-132 Course Before it was culverted then taken as a sewer this brook rose from the confluence of two streams in the hills of South Hampstead, as the broad ravine between Barrow and Primrose Hills. Its main source was the Shepherd's Well near Fitzjohn's Avenue, Hampstead.Clayton, Antony. (2000) Subterranean City: Beneath the Streets of London. London: Historical Publications. p. 33.

(6th Edition, 2009) As the map shows, these again split in two, one in the then lower, thus typically Spring tide immersed bank, where Whitehall sits, the other close to Vincent Square, Pimlico, Westminster. Most of its catchment drains into soakaways in gravel soil, in turn into the chalk water table beneath or into the two-type and hybrid type of drainage set out in Victorian London. A related surface water drain underneath Buckingham Palace. In its depression run key (lateral) sewers which connect to Bazalgette's west-to-east Interceptor sewers. Marylebone Lane, Jason Street, Gees Court, South Molton Lane then Bruton Lane -- three of which defy the grid of streets, reflect where the stream ran. From its source at the Shepherd's Well near Fitzjohns Avenue in Hampstead its successor is Scholar's Pond Sewer southward along that avenue through the Swiss Cottage part of South Hampstead under Avenue Road to Regent's Park. To enter the park's perimeter the part-foul (combined) run is carried enpiped over the Regent's Canal then culverted. The Tyburn gave its name to the former area of Tyburn, a manor of Marylebone, which was recorded in Domesday Book and which stood approximately at the west end of what is now Oxford Street, where from late medieval times until the 18th century traitors were left following hanging at Tyburn Gallows. Tyburn gave its name to the predecessors of Oxford Street and Park Lane—Tyburn Road and Tyburn Lane respectively. An antiques shop claims that part of the river flows through an open conduit in its basement. Grays Antique Centre near the junction of Oxford Street and Davies Street claims that the body of water which can be seen in an open conduit in the basement of its premises is part of the Tyburn; it is undoubtedly close to the culverted course of the stream. The Londonist website describes this suggestion as \\"fanciful\\", as the modern Tyburn is a sewer. The stream's south followed Lansdowne Row, the north-east of Curzon Street then White Horse Street and the pedestrian avenue of Green Park to the front gates of Buckingham Palace (foot of Constitution Hill) from where one mouth used the depression of St James's Park Lake and Downing Street to reach two close-paired mouths. A third distributary is untraced in the building lines and street layout to Thorney Street close to Lambeth Bridge, whilst a fourth distributary forms the natural collect for a sewer pipe, King's Scholar's Pond Sewer, to the Victoria Embankment interceptor, saving it from discharging west of Vauxhall Bridge.

It is also known by the titles Minbo: the Gentle Art of Japanese Extortion, The Gangster's Moll and The Anti-Extortion Woman. The film was widely popular in Japan and a critical success internationally. It satirizes the yakuza, who retaliated for their portrayal in the film by assaulting the director. Plot summary The owner of a high-class Japanese hotel, the Europa, hopes to win a prestigious and lucrative contract for the hotel as the site of a summit meeting between important international officials. Unfortunately, the yakuza have taken a liking to this hotel as both a hangout and a target for extortion. In order to win the contract, the owner realizes, he must rid the hotel of the yakuza. Fearing to confront them himself, he deputizes a hotel accountant, Suzuki (Yasuo Daichi) and a bellboy and former college sumo-club member, Wakasugi (Takehiro Murata). The hapless pair are no more daring than their employer, however, and their tentative attempts to address the problem fail until they meet Mahiru Inoue (Nobuko Miyamoto), a lawyer who specializes in dealing with the yakuza. With Inoue's direction, the hotel staff comes together to face down the yakuza ruffians, who are portrayed as craven, outwardly-threatening- but-inwardly-weak, fools. Definition of \\"Minbo\\" The name \\"minbo\\", is a contraction of MINji kainyu BOryoku (民事介入暴力), literally translated as \\"violent intervention in civil affairs\\". It was a technique utilized by the yakuza following the crackdown of traditionally \\"victimless\\" crimes of drugs, gambling, and prostitution in the early 1980s, and exploited the Japanese reluctance towards confrontation in order to \\"gently extort\\" money from otherwise innocent individuals by making a scene with implied threats of violence over trivial matters. Attack against Juzo Itami The yakuza, who prefer to think of themselves as something akin to modern-day samurai, were angered by their portrayal in Minbo as common thugs and bullies. Three knife- wielding members of the Goto-gumi yakuza gang attacked director Juzo Itami near his home on May 22, 1992, six days after the movie opened. Itami was beaten and had his face slashed. The brutality of the attack, combined with Itami's popularity and the success of Minbo, led to a public outcry and a government crackdown against yakuza activity.

A major poet of the Depression era, he addressed the shallowness and consumerism of American society as he saw it, often by ironically adapting the language of commerce and media. Critics have associated him with the American Left to varying degrees; his poetry belongs to the American proletarian poetry movement, but is rarely overtly political. Fearing published six original collections of poetry between 1929 and 1956. He wrote his best-known poems during the late 1920s and 1930s. He moved from Illinois to New York City in 1924, and spent the rest of his life there. He supported himself by writing pulp fiction, often under pseudonyms. Around 1939 be began to write novels and wrote less poetry. His seven novels are mystery and thriller stories with some unconventional characteristics. They often feature many characters who are given one or more chapters from their point of view, and in a few later novels he used fictional newspaper articles and radio transcripts to further the narrative. His most famous novel, The Big Clock, has remained in print since its 1946 publication and was adapted for film. Personal biography Fearing was born in Oak Park, Illinois, to a privileged family:Wald, 31 his father was Harry Lester Fearing (d. 1940), a successful Chicago attorney and descendant of the family of Calvin Coolidge. His mother Olive Flexner Fearing was of Jewish descent and a cousin of the educator Abraham Flexner. His parents divorced when he was a year old, and they each had custody of him six months of the year. He was raised mainly by his aunt, Eva Fearing Scholl, in the other half of a duplex that the Fearings owned and lived in. He had a half-sister Ethel (b. 1916) and a half-brother Ralph (b. 1918). Fearing went to school at Oak Park and River Forest High School, where he was voted \\"wittiest boy and class pessimist\\". He was the editor of the student newspaper, a position previously held by Ernest Hemingway. He studied English at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (1920–1922) and the University of Wisconsin (1922–1924). At the latter, he became editor-in-chief of the school's literary magazine, but was forced to resign in part for his acceptance of Modernist writing and other controversial material. He left without graduating, being one class short of a degree. In 1938 the University of Wisconsin awarded him the degree in absentia; presumably the school wanted to recognize his fame. As a young man Fearing was thin, with dark hair and skin, and liked to wear dark suits. His voice was low and lispy. He had a \\"little-boy appeal\\", with messy hair and habits, horn-rimmed glasses, and an immature dispositionWald, 31—some of which may be seen in Alice Neel's oil portrait, painted in 1935, which is now at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The portrait includes some references to Fearing's poetry and shows a small skeleton in his chest, grasping his heart and pouring blood from it; Neel commented that \\"He really sympathized with humanity ... His heart bled for the grief of the world.\\" After his death, according to Robert M. Ryley, friends remembered \\"his charm, his eloquence, his almost courtly manners, his prickly independence, his not-quite-hidden vulnerability and innocence—but mostly they would remember his gloomy, sardonic skepticism\\". During the late 1920s he had a romantic relationship with the writer and activist Margery Latimer, whom he met at Wisconsin. (Latimer's roman à clef This Is My Body includes a character based on Fearing.) Fearing cheated on Latimer and never proposed to her; she rejected his later attempt to renew their relationship. In 1931, he met Rachel Meltzer, a nurse by training and a medical social worker. Fearing was poor at expressing affection in person (if not in his letters) and less interested in marriage than Meltzer. She later said of her husband, \\"Kenneth spent his whole life hiding his inner self from other people\\"; \\"[he] needed someone to take care of him.\\" They were married on April 26, 1933, and their son, Bruce Fearing, was born on July 19, 1935. The family soon travelled to Europe for nine months thanks to the $2,500 that came with Kenneth's 1935 Guggenheim Fellowship. Partly due to Fearing's growing alcoholism, he and Rachel divorced in 1941, with Rachel having custody of their son. He stayed at the Yaddo artists' retreat for the first time in 1938 and returned often. At Yaddo he began a relationship with the painter Nan Lurie and they married on June 18, 1945. In this period his drinking became dangerous to his health, which scared him into temperance. Nan found him duller as a result, and their relationship suffered. They separated in 1952. This was his last marriage. Fearing lacked money for much of his life (the period following his most successful novel was the exception). In New York, he received a monthly allowance from his mother until 1935, when she decided that her son should bear full responsibility for his new child. His mother had been skeptical of his choice of writing career.) He also relied on gifts from his father and loans from Latimer in those years. He held few full-time jobs for more than a few months, despite claiming, apparently falsely, to have worked as a salesman, a journalist, and even a lumberjack in press materials. In the 1950s, he worked for the \\"Books\\" section of Newsweek magazine (1952–1954), and, during his single longest period of employment, he developed press material and annual reports for the Muscular Dystrophy Association of America (1955–1958). Still, he lived in poverty in the 1950s, and had smoked and drank heavily for most of his life, which seriously affected his health in his last years. In early 1961, he felt a sharp pain in his back that worsened through June, when his son Bruce moved in to care for him. They went to Lenox Hill Hospital on June 21, and five days later Fearing died of a melanoma of his left chest and pleural cavity. He is buried at Forest Home Cemetery in Forest Park, Illinois. Literary career In December 1924, Fearing moved to New York City, joining Latimer, where he pursued a writing career. His friend the poet Horace Gregory noted that his early writing was not particularly successful, but Fearing was particularly determined to make a living in writing. His early work was commercial, including stories for pulp magazines, and he often wrote under pseudonyms. He wrote sex-pulp novels at half a cent a word, which were published under the pseudonym Kirk Wolff.Sources spell it Wolfe, Wolff, and Wolf. Meanwhile, he searched for editors who would publish his poetry. Fearing told a writers' convention in 1948 that \\"Literature is a means for crystallizing the myths under which society lives.\\"Wald, 26 His poetic influences included Walt Whitman, who he said was \\"the first writer to create a technique indigenous to the whole of this country's outlook\\", and François Villon, John Keats, and Edwin Arlington Robinson. He enjoyed Maurice Ravel and the painter George Grosz.Wald, 24 His early poems were published in magazines such as Poetry, Scribner's, The New Yorker, the New Masses, Free Verse, Voices, and The Menorah Journal. About 44 of his poems were published before his first book of poetry came out. He was involved in the formation of the League of American Writers in 1935 and worked for its national council in the first year. He participated in the Federal Writers' Project during the Depression, and in 1939 he taught at the New York Writers School. Poetry Fearing's first book of poetry, Angel Arms (1929), was dedicated to Margery Latimer and had an introduction by Edward Dahlberg. The next book, Poems (1935), was a success and won him the first of two Guggenheim Fellowships (the fellowship was renewed in 1939). These two volumes contain some of his best- known poems, such as \\"Jack Knuckles Falters\\", \\"1935\\", \\"X Minus X\\", and \\"Dirge\\". He published five original poetry collections; the remaining three are Dead Reckoning: A Book of Poetry (1938), Afternoon of a Pawnbroker and Other Poems (1943), and Stranger at Coney Island and Other Poems (1948). While his early poetry was well received, critics began to find his work repetitive in the 1940s. He was first anthologized in Collected Poems of Kenneth Fearing (1940). Fearing was most productive, and his future most bright, between 1938 and 1943, when he published a book of poetry or a novel each year. Even then, his royalties during this period were minimal, and only exceeded the publisher's advance on two occasions (the Collected Poems and the novel The Hospital). Despite the fame, he remained dependent on his wife Rachel's income. =Poetic themes and style= His poetry is concerned with \\"a society that was morally bankrupt and ... sapped by the economic and political maneuvers necessary to support the American ideal of 'getting ahead'\\". The characters in many of his poems are \\"types\\", and the effects of commerce and consumerism on the psyche are presented as if typical to everyone. The narrator is often superficially dispassionate, an ironic surveyor of the scene, but may reveal anger in the form of \\"sarcasm, contemptuous reductiveness, caricature, cartoony distortion, mocking hyperbole\\". In \\"Dirge\\" (Poems), a successful \\"executive type\\" eventually loses his status via setbacks—\\"nevertheless, they shut off his gas; nevertheless, the / bank foreclosed; nevertheless, the landlord called\\"—and dies by suicide. The poem ironically intersperses comic-book language in its otherwise emotionless recounting: \\"And wow he died as wow he lived, / going whop to the office and blooie home to sleep and / biff got married and bam had children and oof got fired, / zowie did he live and zowie did he die\\". This effect, according to Nathaniel Mills, \\"indicates the manner in which mass culture works to deaden the sensory reality of pain ... For the reader, the aesthetic response of disorientation, unexpected excitement, or shock prompts a critical reflection: what sort of cultural and political formation could cheapen experience to the extent of rendering an obituary as 'zowie did he live and zowie did he die?'\\" The language of mass media similarly intrudes in \\"Jack Knuckles Falters\\" (1926), in which a war veteran has been sentenced to death for murder. In his final words, he struggles with his competing needs to proclaim his innocence and meet his death with \\"dignity\\". Newspaper headlines that cover his execution interrupt each stanza and undermine his speech: \\"\\" They convey nothing of his personal struggle but rather satisfy the public's need for a simple narrative in which a \\"criminal\\" is punished. The headline has moved on to another topic as the man proclaims his innocence. According to the poet Mark Halliday, \\"Fearing in 1926 (before television, before the Internet) is not calling for some practical redesigning of news delivery; he is asking his reader to think about the psychological effect of the simultaneous availability of countless bits of information, all formatted for quick-snack consumption.\\" Fearing commonly uses a particular syntax, which Halliday describes as an \\"anaphoric elaboration of a subordinate clause that waits in limbo for its controlling statement to arrive\\". This delay can be \\"a way of representing a life which people mostly can't shape for themselves, a world of people who can't be the agents of their experience and mostly live subordinated to great mysterious forces\\". The first two stanzas of \\"X Minus X\\" (from Poems) illustrate this style: Fiction As the critical reception of his poetry declined into the 1940s—Halliday suggests that Fearing \\"seems to have felt increasingly jaded and skeptical about poetry's chance to participate in public life\\"—Fearing turned to novels. Between 1939 and 1960 he wrote seven mystery or \\"thriller\\" novels, although their formal qualities defy simple genre categorization.Wald, 25 The most significant are The Hospital (1939), Dagger of the Mind (1941), Clark Gifford's Body (1942), and The Big Clock (1946). Fearing was well-known in 1939, and his first novel, The Hospital, quickly sold six thousand copies. A power outage at a hospital, caused by a drunk janitor, is the central event around which numerous characters' lives are portrayed. Each chapter is devoted to one character's point of view, a style common to all of Fearing's novels. The novel was criticized for the large number of characters and their lack of depth, a complaint that continued throughout Fearing's fiction career. Critics, however, praised its crisp prose style—one called it a \\"staccato prose poem\\"—and its portrayal of lower-class characters like the janitor. Dagger of the Mind (1941) is a psychological thriller in which there is a murder at an art colony. The creation of suspense from states of mind (via interior monologue) rather than physical violence was a departure from most novels of its type. Clark Gifford's Body (1942) recounts a revolution in an unnamed country that begins with the title character's attack on a radio station. It has more than twenty characters, moves back and forth in time, and inserts contradictory radio and newspaper accounts of events. The novel's experimental aspects and pessimism were not met well by readers. The Big Clock first appeared in an abridged form in The American Magazine as \\"The Judas Picture\\" (October 1946) He worked for 14 months on his most well-known novel, The Big Clock (1946), whose protagonist, an editor for a crime magazine, is put in charge of a murder investigation by his boss—but both men had had a relationship with the murdered woman. The novel was more successful than his prior efforts artistically and commercially, with an engaging plot and more character depth. Alan M. Wald, an historian of the American Left, calls it \\"a psychosexual roman noir stressing the sinister effect of market segmentation in the publishing industry\\".Wald, 24 It was critically well-received, and was popular enough that a Bantam paperback and an Armed Services Edition soon followed. It remains in print.Wald, 22 The novel was developed into a film of the same name in 1948, and again in 1987 (No Way Out). The novel earned Fearing $60,000 from republication and film rights. His financial success was short-lived, as income from the novel dried up due to the unfavorable contracts that he had negotiated himself. Wald summarizes the \\"frightening and fragmented hollowness\\" that Fearing saw in post-war US society and depicted in The Big Clock: In Loneliest Girl in the World (1951), an audio recording and storage device named \\"Mikki\\" is at the center of a mystery. Ellen Vaughn, the daughter of its inventor, uses the machine's \\"463,635 hours of recorded speeches, music, and business transactions\\" to determine the circumstances of her father's death. She finds a recording in which her father and his brother argue about the best way to exploit \\"Mikki\\", which Ellen ultimately destroys with a gun. The story is unusual in that the mystery is resolved with retrieved information rather than \\"detection\\". The Crozart Story (1960) is about the heads of two rival public relations firms.Fearing has one PR head explain how he shaped public opinion: \\"The fantasies we were adroitly joining and fashioning into loaded rumors, those gossamer rumors we were transmuting into triggered press releases, those childlike releases we were everywhere implementing with public degradation, internal exile, imprisonment, those incandescent anxieties we were molding and hardening into death's-head taboos—all these components of the commando raids we were mounting for the world's richest haul consisted of words, basically, only words.\\" The novel was abstract and lacking in plot, and its reception was poor. It did not earn enough to pay Fearing's advance. Critics state that Fearing's two last novels, particularly The Crozart Story, are more like unfinished sketches in places, and are suggestive of his declining motivation to write, his declining health due to alcoholism, or both.Wald, 25, 30 Politics Accounts vary as to Fearing's degree of association with Marxism and the American Left. Marxists courted him and suggested that he contribute to periodicals like the New Masses, which he did, beginning in 1926, and he was a contributing editor there from 1930 to 1933. He was a founding member of the John Reed Club in 1929, where he was on the editorial board of the communist Partisan Review;Wald, 31-32 he is commonly included among its cofounders after the magazine repositioned itself as anti-Stalinist. He put his name to various pro-Soviet declarations from 1931 through to the 1939 \\"Open Letter of the 400\\", which defended Stalin's regime. Yet Fearing's poems were almost never overtly political, and his associates often found him uncommitted to communism. He told the Daily Worker in 1938, \\"I've not tried deliberately to be Marxist in my poetry ... Marxism is valuable in literature only to the extent that the writer assimilates it. Consequently its principles become part of a writer's background, the way he thinks and feels and interprets it.\\" Fearing's family maintained that \\"politics was never an important part of his life\\". His son Bruce said that his father \\"used a leftist political milieu to get his poetry published; he didn't believe in politics, he believed in poetry\\". As a Jew, a pacifist, and an anti-fascist, Fearing was uncomfortable with the American Communist Party's support of the Hitler-Stalin pact in 1939. (As a child, Fearing witnessed the \\"reflexive anti-semitism\\" of his father towards his wife's family.) The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact prompted him to write a poem, \\"Pact\\", which was published in the New Yorker that year and contained hints to his allies that he was breaking rank.Wald, 36 Wald writes that Fearing had \\"a mistrust of all political premises and a disbelief in all ameliorative options, [which] ran contrary to any connection with a large organization that demanded ideological conformity and an activist commitment\\".Wald, 33 In the era of McCarthyism his political associations were sufficient for him to be interviewed by the FBI and called before the House Un-American Activities Committee. The FBI reported that \\"[Fearing said] he had become a 'fellow traveler' in 1933, and that prior to that time he had not been very interested in the meetings of the John Reed Club due to the fact that he was not interested in the politics discussed at all the meetings.\\" Before the Committee in 1950, when asked if he was a member of the Communist Party, Fearing replied, \\"Not yet.\\" Legacy The literary critic Macha Rosenthal called Fearing \\"the chief poet of the American Depression\\". He influenced the Beat poets, such as Allen Ginsberg. Alan Filreis writes that Fearing's \\"demotic, chatty, antic, digressive style made Ginsberg possible\\", and Fearing's contemporary Marya Zaturenska said of Ginsberg, \\"isn't 3/4 of him straight out of Kenneth Fearing?\\" Since Fearing's death, critics have offered more positive appraisals of his later poetry. In a 1970 article on the \\"Dynamo\\" school of poets, Estelle Novak wrote, \\"Fearing's true appeal as a revolutionary poet was his ability to combine realistic description and political comment in the form of a readable poem that lost nothing of its quality as poem while it gained in propaganda value.\\" By the 1990s there was a \\"minor revival\\", with the National Poetry Foundation's publication of Kenneth Fearing Complete Poems in 1994, and the poet Mark Halliday published an essay, \\"Damned Good Poet: Kenneth Fearing\\" (2001), which included an analysis of the poet's themes. A selection of Fearing's poems has been published as part of the Library of America's American Poets Project.

He previously served as Bishop of Hradec Králové. Early years Duka was born in 1943 in Hradec Králové in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (now in the Czech Republic). His father was an army officer who fought for the allied forces in World War II, based at RAF Cosford, who was later imprisoned in Czechoslovakia in the 1950s. Duka graduated from Tyl Grammar School in Hradec Králové in 1960 and worked in a factory and as an apprentice locksmith before entering military service from 1962 to 1964. Priestly ministry On 6 January 1969 he made temporary profession in the Dominican Order and on 22 June 1970 he was ordained a priest by Cardinal Štěpán Trochta, Bishop of Litoměřice. For five years he worked in parishes of the Archdiocese of Prague and, on 7 January 1972, he made his solemn profession in the Dominican Order. In 1975, the Communist government of Czechoslovakia revoked Duka's authorization to work as a priest. From then until the regime collapsed in 1989, Duka worked as a designer at the Škoda factory in Plzeň. In the meantime, he worked in secret in the Order and was elected the province's Vicar Provincial and served from 1975 until 1987. From 1976 to 1981, he taught theology to seminarians at the Theological Faculty of Litoměřice. In 1979, he obtained a licentiate in theology at the Theological Faculty of St. John the Baptist in Warsaw, Poland. As a result of his activities with the Dominican Order and involvement in the publication of unauthorised samizdat literature, he was imprisoned in Bory Prison in Plzeň from 1981-82, where his fellow prisoners included future Czech President Vaclav Havel. While in prison, Duka conducted a clandestine mass for other prisoners disguised as a chess club.Zantovsky (2014) p.234-235 From 1986 to 1998 he was Prior Provincial of the Dominicans in Bohemia and Moravia. From 1990–98, he was a lecturer in the Faculty of Theology at Palacký University in Olomouc, teaching Introduction to Sacred Scripture and biblical anthropology. Duka was elected president of the Conference of Major Superiors of the Czech Republic and served from 1989 to 1992. In 1992, he became the vice president of the Union of European Conferences of Major Superiors, serving until 1996. Episcopacy On 6 June 1998 Duka was appointed bishop of Hradec Králové and received episcopal consecration on 26 September 1998. On 13 February 2010, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him Archbishop of Prague. Duka was formally installed in Prague's St. Vitus Cathedral. On his appointment, Duka said that: > \\"The Church must engage in a dialogue with society and must seek > reconciliation with it. Twenty years ago, we were euphoric about freedom; > today we live in an economic and financial crisis, and also to a certain > extent in a crisis of values. So the tasks are going to be a little more > difficult. But thanks to everything that’s been done, it will not be a > journey into the unknown.\\" One of Duka's chief concerns was the long-standing issue of the restitution of church property, which had been confiscated by the communist regime, and which was either never fully returned or for which the church was never compensated. The Czech Republic is one of the last countries in Europe not to have ratified a treaty with the Holy See. After previous attempts at an agreement had failed – most notably in 2008 under Cardinal Vlk – the Czech government in mid- January 2012 agreed to a compensation plan, under which the country's seventeen churches, including Catholic and Protestant, would get 56% of their former property now held by the state – estimated at 75 billion koruna ($3.7 billion) — and 59 billion koruna ($2.9 billion) in financial compensation paid to them over the next thirty years. The state will also gradually stop covering their expenses over the next seventeen years. On 23 December 2011, Duka delivered the liturgy at the funeral of Vaclav Havel.Zantovsky (2014) p.13 Cardinalate On 18 February 2012, Duka was made Cardinal-Priest of Santi Marcellino e Pietro. On 21 April 2012, he was appointed to the Congregation for the Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life and Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace. Duka was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2013 papal conclave that selected Pope Francis. Duka contributed to a book Eleven Cardinals Speak on Marriage and the Family which urged fellow church leaders to maintain the church's rules regarding marriage and strengthen Catholic education about marriage and family life. The book was released before the world Synod of Bishops on the family in October 2015. In May 2016, Duka claimed that the pope could not fully understand the refugee crisis because he is not from Europe. Duka has frequently spoken against Muslim immigration into Europe, and has said that Muslims can only be considered a \\"safe presence\\" if they make up less than five percent of the population. Duka has had several clashes with a Templeton winner, Tomáš Halík. In August 2015, Duka banned a conference by Jeannine Gramick, an American nun specialising in pastoral care for LGBT people, as well as the screening of a Polish film about a homosexual priest. In a statement setting out his objections, Duka said: \\"Most participants are not believers and have no intention of addressing their relationship with the Church. Since I do not think people with this sexual orientation are discriminated against in our country, it is not right for us to advocate things which are in direct conflict with the Catholic Church’s teachings.\\" In 2016, Halík criticized Duka for allegedly dissociating himself from the pope and for being too close to the Czech president Miloš Zeman. They disagree on Islam and its \\"violent tendencies\\". Halík also criticized Cardinal Duka in October 2016, for accepting the highest state award from President Milos Zeman, telling Právo: \\"On the October 28 national holiday, when Milos Zeman was bestowing a medal on Dominik Duka for his support for Miloš Zeman, I remembered the words a former Pope, who commented on the death of Cardinal Richelieu — He said if God exists, the cardinal will probably have a lot to explain to him; if God does not exist, the cardinal did his job perfectly. I would be ashamed to accept an award from Milos Zeman. However, Cardinal Duka seems to have got on a train he will never have the courage to leave. This makes me sorry.\\" In February 2018, a group of Czech Catholic laymen wrote a letter to Pope Francis, expressing concern about Duka's closeness to Czech politicians including Vaclav Klaus, Milos Zeman and Tomio Okamura, and urging him not to extend Duka's mandate for the Archbishopric when Duka turned 75 in April 2018.

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase catalyzes the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a cosubstrate for homocysteine remethylation to methionine. Natural variation in this gene is common in otherwise healthy people. Although some variants have been reported to influence susceptibility to occlusive vascular disease, neural tube defects, Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, colon cancer, and acute leukemia, findings from small early studies have not been reproduced. Some mutations in this gene are associated with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency. Complex I deficiency with recessive spastic paraparesis has also been linked to MTHFR variants. In addition, the aberrant promoter hypermethylation of this gene is associated with male infertility and recurrent spontaneous abortion.  Biochemistry  In the rate-limiting step of the methyl cycle, MTHFR irreversibly reduces 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (substrate) to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (product). * 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate is used to convert dUMP to dTMP for de novo thymidine synthesis. * 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate is used to convert homocysteine (a potentially toxic amino acid) to methionine by the enzyme methionine synthase. (Note that homocysteine can also be converted to methionine by the folate- independent enzyme betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT)) MTHFR contains a bound flavin cofactor and uses NAD(P)H as the reducing agent.  Structure  Mammalian MTHFR is composed of an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain. MTHFR has at least two promoters and two isoforms (70 kDa and 77 kDa).  Regulation  MTHFR activity may be inhibited by binding of dihydrofolate (DHF) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM, or AdoMet). MTHFR can also be phosphorylated – this decreases its activity by ~20% and allows it to be more easily inhibited by SAM.  Genetics  The enzyme is coded by the gene with the symbol MTHFR on chromosome 1 location p36.3 in humans. There are DNA sequence variants (genetic polymorphisms) associated with this gene. In 2000 a report brought the number of polymorphisms up to 24. Two of the most investigated are C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).  C677T SNP (Ala222Val)  The MTHFR nucleotide at position 677 in the gene has two possibilities: C (cytosine) or T (thymine). C at position 677 (leading to an alanine at amino acid 222) is the normal allele. The 677T allele (leading to a valine substitution at amino acid 222) encodes a thermolabile enzyme with reduced activity. Individuals with two copies of 677C (677CC) have the most common genotype. 677TT individuals (homozygous) have lower MTHFR activity than CC or CT (heterozygous) individuals. About ten percent of the North American population are T-homozygous for this polymorphism. There is ethnic variability in the frequency of the T allele – frequency in Mediterranean/Hispanics is greater than the frequency in Caucasians which, in turn, is greater than in Africans/African-Americans. The degree of enzyme thermolability (assessed as residual activity after heat inactivation) is much greater in 677TT individuals (18–22%) compared with 677CT (56%) and 677CC (66–67%). Individuals of 677TT are predisposed to mild hyperhomocysteinemia (high blood homocysteine levels), because they have less active MTHFR available to produce 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (which is used to decrease homocysteine). Low dietary intake of the vitamin folic acid can also cause mild hyperhomocysteinemia. Low folate intake affects individuals with the 677TT genotype to a greater extent than those with the 677CC/CT genotypes. 677TT (but not 677CC/CT) individuals with lower plasma folate levels are at risk for elevated plasma homocysteine levels. In studies of human recombinant MTHFR, the protein encoded by 677T loses its FAD cofactor three times faster than the wild-type protein. 5-Methyl-THF slows the rate of FAD release in both the wild-type and mutant enzymes, although it is to a much greater extent in the mutant enzyme. Low folate status with the consequent loss of FAD enhances the thermolability of the enzyme, thus providing an explanation for the normalised homocysteine and DNA methylation levels in folate-replete 677TT individuals. This polymorphism and mild hyperhomocysteinemia are associated with neural tube defects in offspring, increased risk for complications of pregnancy other complications of pregnancy, arterial and venous thrombosis, and cardiovascular disease. 677TT individuals are at an increased risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and colon cancer. Mutations in the MTHFR gene could be one of the factors leading to increased risk of developing schizophrenia. Schizophrenic patients having the risk allele (T\\\\T) show more deficiencies in executive function tasks. The C677T genotype used to be associated with increased risk of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) in non Caucasians., however this link has been disproved in recent years. The American College of Medical Genetics recommendation guidelines currently state that people with recurrent pregnancy loss should not be tested for variants in the MTHFR gene. There is also a tentative link between MTHFR mutations and dementia. One study of an elderly Japanese population found correlations between the MTHFR 677CT mutation, an Apo E polymorphism, and certain types of senile dementia. Other research has found that individuals with folate-related mutations can still have a functional deficiency even when blood levels of folate are within the normal range, and recommended supplementation of methyltetrahydrofolate to potentially prevent and treat dementia (along with depression). A 2011 study from China also found that the C677T SNP was associated with Alzheimer's disease in Asian populations (though not in Caucasians). C677T polymorphism is associated with risk of myocardial infarction in African, North American, and elderly populations.  A1298C SNP (Glu429Ala)  At nucleotide 1298 of the MTHFR, there are two possibilities: A or C. 1298A (leading to a Glu at amino acid 429) is the most common while 1298C (leading to an Ala substitution at amino acid 429) is less common. 1298AA is the \\"normal\\" homozygous, 1298AC the heterozygous, and 1298CC the homozygous for the \\"variant\\". In studies of human recombinant MTHFR, the protein encoded by 1298C cannot be distinguished from 1298A in terms of activity, thermolability, FAD release, or the protective effect of 5-methyl-THF. The C mutation does not appear to affect the MTHFR protein. It does not result in thermolabile MTHFR and does not appear to affect homocysteine levels. It does, however, affect the conversion of MTHF to BH4 (tetrahydrobiopterin), an important cofactor in the production of neurotransmitters, and the synthesis of nitric oxide. There has been some commentary on a 'reverse reaction' in which tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is produced when 5-methyltetrahydrofolate is converted back into methylenetetrahydrofolate. This however is not universally agreed upon. That reaction is thought to require 5-MTHF and SAMe. An alternative opinion is that 5-MTHF processes peroxynitrite, thereby preserving existing BH4, and that no such 'reverse reaction' occurs. A maternal MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is associated with Down syndrome pregnancy. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis results showed that this polymorphism is a risk factor for Down syndrome pregnancy in Asian populations but not in Caucasian population as well as in overall meta-analysis. MTHFR A1298C may play a role as either a driver in the development of major depressive disorder or as a predictive or diagnostic marker, possibly in combination with C677T.  Detection of MTHFR polymorphisms  A triplex tetra-primer ARMS-PCR method was developed for the simultaneous detection of C677T and A1298C polymorphisms with the A66G MTRR polymorphism in a single PCR reaction.  Severe MTHFR deficiency  Severe MTHFR deficiency is rare (about 50 cases worldwide) and caused by mutations resulting in 0–20% residual enzyme activity. Patients exhibit developmental delay, motor and gait dysfunction, seizures, and neurological impairment and have extremely high levels of homocysteine in their plasma and urine as well as low to normal plasma methionine levels. This deficiency and mutations in MTHFR have also been linked to recessive spastic paraparesis with complex I deficiency. A study on the Chinese Uyghur population indicated that rs1801131 polymorphism in MTHFR was associated with nsCL/P in Chinese Uyghur population. Given the unique genetic and environmental characters of the Uyghur population, these findings may be helpful for exploring the pathogenesis of this complex disease. Epigenetics The MTHFR aberrant promoter hypermethylation is associated with male infertility. Furthermore, this improper epigenetic phenomenon was observed in semen samples of infertile males belonging to couples with an history of recurrent spontaneous abortion. The MTHFR improper promoter hypermethylation may affect the two essential roles of DNA methylation in spermatogenetic cells, the global genome methylation process and the genomic imprinting of paternal genes. In addition, MTHFR gene promoter hypermethylation has also been associated with methylation loss at H19 imprinted gene in semen samples from infertile males.  As a drug target  Inhibitors of MTHFR and antisense knockdown of the expression of the enzyme have been proposed as treatments for cancer. The active form of folate, L-methylfolate, may be appropriate to target for conditions affected by MTHFR polymorphisms.  Reaction and metabolism  The overall reaction catalyzed by MTHFR is illustrated on the right. The reaction uses an NAD(P)H hydride donor and an FAD cofactor.

The promotion of supplements and other treatments for MTHFR polymorphisms, especially centered on autistic spectrum disorder, have been characterised as snake oil. Tests for MTHFR, while gaining popularity, are generally unnecessary because the association of MTHFR gene mutations with various diseases have not been established as clear-cut cause-and-effect relationship.

Her brothel was known as the \\"most orderly of disorderly houses\\". Early life Belle Brezing was born Mary Belle Cox, the illegitimate daughter of Sarah Ann Cox. Sarah Cox was a dressmaker who also worked part- time as a prostitute. Sarah Cox subsequently married George Brezing, a saloon operative, grocer and alcoholic, in 1861, whose name Belle adopted. At the age of 12, the age of consent at the time, Brezing was seduced by Dionesio Mucci, a local merchant who was three times her age. Soon after, Brezing wrote a poem: > Sitting to night in my chamber, a school girl figure and lonely, I kiss the > end of my finger, that and that only. Reveries rises from the smokey mouth. > Memories linger surround me. Boys that are married or single. Gather around > me. School boys in pantalets roumping, Boys that now are growing to be young > lands, Boys that kiked to be Kissed; and like to give kisses. Kisses. I > remember them: Those in the corner were fleetest: Sweet were those won the > Sly in the Dark were the sweetest. Girls are tender and gentle. To woo was > allmost to win them. They lips are good as ripe peaches, and cream for > finger. Girls are sometimes flirts, and coquettish; Now catch and Kiss if > you can sin: could I catch both - ah, wasent I a happy Girl. Boys is pretty > and blooming sweetly, yea sweetness over their rest! Them I loved dearly and > truely. Last and the best. The relationship with Mucci lasted two years, although Brezing had other lovers during this time, including cigar makers James Kenney and Johnny Cook. Soon after her 15th birthday in 1875, Brezing was pregnant, possibly by Johnny Cook, but she had at least three lovers at this time. On September 14, 1875, when Brezing was 3 months pregnant, she married James Kenney, but never lived with him. After the wedding ceremony she returned to her mother's house. Nine days later, Brezing wrote to Cook asking for a gun. Cook was found outside Brezing's house with a bullet in his skull. Mucci was allegedly the last person to see Cook alive. Kenney immediately left Lexington and didn't return for ten years. The death was recorded as a suicide, but popular opinion was that Cook was murdered. On March 14, 1876, Brezing gave birth to a daughter, Daisy May Kenney. In May of that year Brezing's mother died of cancer. Whilst at the funeral, her mothers landlord padlocked the house leaving Brezing and her baby homeless. Brezing left her baby with a neighbour, with a promise to always provide for her, and turned to prostitution. Belle's first job in a brothel began December 24, 1879, in a house maintained by Jenny Hill, which has the distinction of being the former residence of First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln. Brezing quickly became the brothel's top earner and had bankers and politicians amongst her clients. Belle's \\"bawdy houses\\" Gov Blackburn's Pardon of Belle's \\"bawdy house\\" In July 1881, Brezing rented a house at 156 North Upper Street and opened her own brothel. Around this time she arranged for her daughter, Daisy May, to be sent to an institution in Newport, Kentucky. Daisy May was mentally retarded and spent the rest of her life in institutions in Newport and Detroit. Brezing again became pregnant but the baby was stillborn in July 1882. Brezing was determined to make her brothel the finest in Lexington, with the best surroundings and entertainment. She made frequent trips to Cincinnati and New York City to buy linens, furnishings and clothes for the brothel. She had many influential citizens amongst her clients, including bankers, businessmen and politicians. When arrested for keeping a \\"bawdy house\\" in December 1882, she received a pardon from Kentucky Governor Luke P. Blackburn. Two years after starting her brothel she had saved enough money to buy a house, 194 North Upper Street. The brothel transferred to the new premises in July 1883. In the same year she became attached to bookkeeper William \\"Billy\\" Mabon. The couple stayed together until his death. On January 13, 1889, the Lexington Daily Press published a \\"Petition of Citizens\\" on the front page which called for the closing of \\"houses of ill fame conducted by Belle Breezing at 194 North Upper Street; Lettie Powell, 196 N Upper Street; and Molly Parker, 154 N Upper Street.\\" With the help of Philadelphia millionaire William M Singerly, Brezing brought new premises at 153 Megowan Street (now 153 N. Eastern Ave) in the city's red-light district. The brothel quickly established itself as one of the most stylish in the city. The house was badly damaged in a fire in 1895, but rebuilding started immediately. During the building works an additional floor was added. Brezing was known for her charity. When the local hospital had a fire, she brought up all the bed linen locally and sent it to the hospital. A local prostitute, Debbie Harvey, was murdered in 1911. Brezing ensured she had a proper burial in Lexington Cemetery. The Temperance Movement was gaining strength and in 1915 pressured the city commissioners into issuing an ordnance requiring brothels to close. Brezing and some other madams ignored the ordnance. When the US entered World War I in 1917, soldiers were stationed nearby and the US Army ordered to city to close the brothels. On February 16, 1917 Billy Mabon died and by November of that year Brezing had shut the brothel. Retirement and death Brezing continued to live in the premises until her death in 1940. Addicted to morphine, Brezing was attended to by her doctor Dr. C.A. Nevitt. She was diagnosed with uterine cancer in 1938 and passed away on August 11, 1940. She was buried in Calvary Cemetery in Lexington. Her tombstone reads \\"Blessed Be the Pure in Heart\\". Time magazine published her obituary, calling her a \\"famed Kentucky bawd.\\" The Lexington Herald published a front-page eulogy. Her estate was auctioned off over several days. The house was converted into apartments and in 1973 a fire consumed the upper floor. The remaining architectural details were auctioned off. Bricks salvaged from the home were sold to the public with the inscription: \\"Brick from the Belle Brezing Home - The most orderly of Dis-orderly Homes\\". Gone with the Wind Brezing is believed to have been the model for Belle Watling in Gone with the Wind. The author, Margaret Mitchell, allegedly heard about Brezing from her husband who had previously lived in Lexington. Mitchell denied basing Watling on Brezing. The film adaptation was released 6 months before Brezing's death. Legacy Still standing, one of her other former houses is on the campus of Transylvania University and houses a women's locker room. Brezing is commemorated annually in Lexington by a bed race in April. Several of the city's streets are closed to make a course for the race. Margaret C. Price wrote a play about Brezing, simply called Belle Brezing. It was performed at the Lost Theatre in Los Angeles during the summer of 2008. In 2011, Lexington's Actors Guild Theatre presented the play. The actress who played Brezing, Laurie Genet Preston, had previously played that role in a 2004 presentation of the play at the University of Kentucky. Director and producer Doug High made a documentary about Brezing's life: Belle Brezing & the Gilded Age of the Bluegrass. The documentary was narrated by Elizabeth Shatner (wife of William Shatner) and Brezing was again played by Laurie Genet Preston. The film premiered at the Kentucky Theatre Lexington on February 16, 2017.

Its name is a misnomer, as it is actually a prothrombotic antibody. Lupus anticoagulant in living systems cause an increase in inappropriate blood clotting. The name derives from their properties in vitro, as these antibodies increase laboratory coagulation tests such as the aPTT. Investigators speculate that the antibodies interfere with phospholipids used to induce in vitro coagulation. In vivo, the antibodies are thought to interact with platelet membrane phospholipids, increasing adhesion and aggregation of platelets, which accounts for the in vivo prothrombotic characteristics. The condition was first described by hematologist C. Lockard Conley. Terminology Both words in the term \\"lupus anticoagulant\\" can be misleading: * Most patients with a lupus anticoagulant do not actually have lupus erythematosus, and only a small proportion will proceed to develop this disease (which causes joint pains, skin problems and kidney failure, amongst other complications). People with lupus erythematosus are more likely to develop a lupus anticoagulant than the general population. * The term \\"anticoagulant\\" accurately describes its function in vitro. However in vivo, it functions as a procoagulant.  Workup  The presence of prolonged clotting times on a routine plasma test often triggers functional testing of the blood clotting function, as well as serological testing to identify common autoantibodies such as antiphospholipid antibodies. These antibodies tend to delay in-vitro coagulation in phospholipid-dependent laboratory tests such as the partial thromboplastin time. The initial workup of a prolonged PTT is a mixing test whereby the patient's plasma is mixed with normal pooled plasma and the clotting is reassessed. If a clotting inhibitor such as a lupus anticoagulant is present, the inhibitor will interact with the normal pooled plasma and the clotting time will remain abnormal. However, if the clotting time of the mixed plasma corrects towards normal, the presence of an inhibitor such as the lupus anticoagulant is excluded, and instead a deficient quantity of clotting factor (that is replenished by the normal plasma) is likely. If the mixing test indicates an inhibitor, diagnosis of a lupus anticoagulant is then confirmed with prolonged phospholipid-sensitive functional clotting testing, such as the dilute Russell's viper venom time, or the Kaolin clotting time. As a further confirmation, a second test with the addition of excess phospholipid will correct the prolongation (conceptually known as \\"phospholipid neutralization\\"), confirming the diagnosis of a lupus anticoagulant. Treatment Treatment for a lupus anticoagulant is usually undertaken in the context of documented thrombosis, such as extremity phlebitis or dural sinus vein thrombosis. Patients with a well-documented (i.e., present at least twice) lupus anticoagulant and a history of thrombosis should be considered candidates for indefinite treatment with anticoagulants. Patients with no history of thrombosis and a lupus anticoagulant should probably be observed. Current evidence suggests that the risk of recurrent thrombosis in patients with an antiphospholipid antibody is enhanced whether that antibody is measured on serological testing or functional testing. The Sapporo criteria specify that both serological and functional tests must be positive to diagnose the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Miscarriages may be more prevalent in patients with a lupus anticoagulant. Some of these miscarriages may potentially be prevented with the administration of aspirin and unfractionated heparin. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews provide a deeper understanding on the subject. Thrombosis is treated with anticoagulants (LMWHs and warfarin).

Historically used as an irrigation ditch or dyke the network of small watercourses had four lower courses and mouths. History=Etymology The name may be a corruption of 'stoney ford' or 'sandy ford' by which it was crossed by King Street. Stamford Brook has given its name to the surrounding area between Hammersmith and Chiswick and to local London Underground station, Stamford Brook. The county of London formed in 1889 was bounded by the westernmost course of Stamford Brook, forming the boundary separating London Boroughs of Hammersmith and Acton in the new county from the Chiswick and Brentford Urban Districts in Middlesex. By 1900, all six strands of the brook and drainage dykes had been covered over and formed the most useful depressions available in which to site the neighbourhood's sewers, many diversionary surface water drains had been created closer to the surface to drain the catchment basin. Disambiguation Stamford Brook has no known connection with Stamford Bridge, the site of a bridge which carries the Kings Road over the stream to the east called Counter's Creek which rose to the immediate west of Notting Hill. The bridge gives its name to Chelsea Football Club's adjoining ground.

Life She was born Ethel Mary Burwell in Doncaster in England. Her father died when she was two, leaving her mother Sarah Jane Burwell with two daughters (Ethel and Lillian). A year later, Sarah Jane married Henry Turner, who was 20 years older and had six children of his own. Sarah Jane and Henry had a daughter, Rose. Henry Turner died suddenly, leaving Sarah Jane with nine children and little income. In 1879 Sarah Jane moved to Australia with Ethel, Lillian, and Rose; within the next two years she married Charles Cope and gave birth to his son Rex. Ethel Turner was educated at Paddington, New South Wales Public School and Sydney Girls High School—she was one of the school's original thirty-seven pupils. She started her writing career at eighteen, founding the Parthenon, a journal for young people, with her sister Lillian. As 'Dame Durden' she wrote children's columns for the Illustrated Sydney News and later for the Australian Town and Country Journal.Jane Stewart, 'Turner [née Burwell], Ethel (Sybil) ['Dame Durden']', in The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English, ed. Lorna Sage, 1999 In 1891, the family moved to Inglewood (now known as Woodlands), a large house in Lindfield, now Killara, which was then out in the country. Woodlands still stands today in Werona Avenue and is where she wrote Seven Little Australians. In 1896 Ethel married Herbert Curlewis, a lawyer. After living in Mosman, they built their own house overlooking Middle Harbour. The house, Avenel, is where Ethel Turner spent the rest of her years. She survived her daughter Jean Curlewis, who died of tuberculosis, by 28 years. Jean was also a writer of children's books, although not as popular as her mother. Jean's works include The Ship That Never Set Sail, Drowning Maze, and Beach Beyond (1923). Her son Adrian, was a Barrister, Captain in WW2 and a Changi and Thai-Burma Railway POW and later Judge. Ethel Turner died at Mosman on 8 April 1958 at 85. She is buried at Macquarie Park Cemetery in Sydney's North. Career Her best-known work is her first novel, Seven Little Australians (1894), which is widely considered a classic of Australian children's literature and was an instant hit both in Australia and overseas. It is about a family of seven children growing up in Australia. The book, together with its sequels The Family at Misrule (1895) and Little Mother Meg (1902) deal with the lives of the Woolcot family, particularly with its seven mischievous and rebellious children, in 1880s Australia. A companion to \\"Seven Little Australians\\", Judy and Punch was published in 1928. Like her stepfather, the character of Captain Woolcot was a widower with six children. The book was made into a feature film in Australia in 1939 and a UK television series in 1953. A 10-episode television series was made in 1973 by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Turner published a number of other books for children, short stories and poems. Three Little Maids (1900) is a strongly autobiographical novel about her family's migration from England to Sydney, Australia. Turner wrote more than forty novels. Some were about the mischievous Woolcots. Others were serialized, like her books on \\"the Cub\\", and some were stand-alone. The children she wrote about were all adventurous and independent. They frequently got themselves into sticky situations and got themselves out of them with very little to no adult help. Awards and honours Turner was awarded a number of prestigious literary awards and could be considered one of Australia's best-loved authors. She is listed on The Australian Women's Register. The Ethel Turner Prize for Young People's Literature is given annually under the auspices of the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards.NSW Premier's Literary Awards Curlewis Crescent in the Canberra suburb of Garran is named in her honour and also for her husband.

Blandus was the grandson of Rubellius Blandus of Tibur, a member of the Equestrian class, who was the first Roman to teach rhetoric. He was suffect consul from August to December AD 18 with Marcus Vipstanus Gallus as his colleague.Alison E. Cooley, The Cambridge Manual of Latin Epigraphy (Cambridge: University Press, 2012), p. 459 In AD 33, he married Julia Livia, granddaughter of the Roman emperor Tiberius. Career As the first member of his family to be admitted to the Senate, Blandus is considered a homo novus, which repeatedly had a negative effect on his career. His cursus honorum is documented in several inscriptions found in North Africa.IRT 269, 330, 331 Blandus began his career with the singular honor of being quaestor in service to the emperor Augustus; two more of the traditional Republican magistracies followed, plebeian tribune and praetor. Two years after he served as suffect consul, he was involved with the prosecution of Aemilia Lepida, putting forward a motion in the senate to outlaw her which carried.Tacitus, Annales, III.23 The primary sources disagree when Blandus was admitted to the prestigious College of Pontiffs, whether it was before or after his consulate; one inscription lists it before, while two list it afterwards. Hoffman notes Blandus \\"probably received the priesthood late because of his low birth.\\"Martha W. Hoffman Lewis, The Official Priests of Rome under the Julio- Claudians (Rome: American Academy, 1955), p. 33 Despite his background, Blandus achieved what came to be the pinnacle of a successful senatorial career, proconsular governor of Africa in 35/36. Upon returning to Rome, Blandus was selected as one of four members of a commission to assess damage a fire had caused in Rome earlier that year.Tacitus, Annales, VI.45 Marriages and family In the year 33 he married Julia Livia, one of the princesses of the Imperial house.

He worked for World Wrestling Entertainment in its Ohio Valley Wrestling developmental territory. He is best known as Roadkill, where his wrestling gear was traditional Amish dress and he was billed as being from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, an area of large Amish population. Professional wrestling career=Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996–2001) Roadkill was trained by Taz and Perry Saturn at the ECW House of Hardcore in 1996. Once his training was complete, he joined the ECW roster, and had his first professional match on October 18, 1996 in LuLu Temple in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania against Taz. In December 1997, Roadkill formed an unlikely tag team with his fellow House of Hardcore graduate, Danny Doring. They were managed by Miss Congeniality until she left ECW in 1999 to join the World Wrestling Federation, and then by Elektra until she turned on them in 2000. Doring and Roadkill quickly embarked on a two- year-long feud with Nova and Chris Chetti. This was followed by a series of feuds with the Impact Players (Lance Storm and Justin Credible), Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger, Joey Matthews and Christian York, and then Tommy Dreamer and Raven. The team won the ECW World Tag Team Championships on December 3, 2000, at the Massacre on 34th Street pay-per-view, defeating Tony Mamaluke and Little Guido. They held the titles until ECW declared bankruptcy on April 4, 2001. Doring and Roadkill were the last team to hold the ECW Tag Team Titles. Roadkill made an appearance in 2001 on The Real World: Back to New York, confronting cast member Mike Mizanin's wrestling character The Miz, while in the Amish Roadkill character, about his wrestling antics. Independent circuit (2001–2005) Roadkill and Doring wrestled on three Total Nonstop Action Wrestling pay per views when TNA was running weekly pay per views back in early 2002. They wrestled Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger, twice winning a non-title match but losing the match for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. In their last TNA appearance they wrestled Ekmo Fatu and Sonny Siaki. On December 28, 2002 Roadkill made his debut in Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling (3PW) defeating Rockin' Rebel. On December 27, 2003 he formed a team with The Blue Meanie but would lose that night against Mike Kruel and Monsta Mack. On April 17, 2004 they would be defeated by Jack Victory and Rockin' Rebel and after the match Roadkill turned on the Blue Meanie because Commissioner Raven had told him that he was a shell of his former self. He would then face Blue Meanie in the next two shows (managed by Jasmin St. Claire) defeating him on May 15, 2004 and losing to him on June 19. After the second match The Pitbulls showed up to support Roadkill but would turn on him with St. Claire after the match. Roadkill would then win three singles matches on August 21 and January 15 and February 19, 2005. Because of this singles success he would get a shot at the 3PW Heavyweight Championship against Wagner Brown on March 19 and April 9, 2005 but would be on the losing end of both those matches. However, on May 21, 2005 he defeated Brown in a Triple Threat Match that also included Simon Diamond to become the new 3PW Heavyweight Champion. World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001, 2005–2008) After ECW folded, Doring and Roadkill wrestled dark matches for World Wrestling Entertainment. They appeared against fellow ECW originals F.B.I., Little Guido and Tony Mamaluke, in early 2001 at Madison Square Garden. Doring and Roadkill were defeated by MNM on July 21, 2005 in a match taped for WWE's Velocity. Roadkill appeared at the WWE promoted ECW reunion show, ECW One Night Stand on June 12, 2005. He signed a contract with WWE and was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling. Roadkill would continue his work with OVW and on April 5, 2006 he won the promotion's Southern Tag Team Titles with Kasey James by defeating Deuce 'n Domino and Kenny and Mikey of The Spirit Squad in a three way tag team match. While in OVW during their run as a team they picked up Michelle McCool as a valet. On the May 5, 2006 edition of SmackDown, Roadkill and James would lose to William Regal and Sylvain Grenier in a tag team dark match. They would lose the Tag Titles to Shad Gaspard and The Neighborhoodie on May 24, ending their 58-day reign as Tag Team Champions. On the June 13 edition of ECW, Roadkill took part in a battle royal (with the winner facing John Cena at Vengeance) but was eliminated by The Big Show before it was eventually won by Sabu. Two weeks later, on the June 27 edition of ECW he faced Sabu in an Extreme Rules Match in which he lost by tapping out to the Camel clutch. On the July 4 edition of ECW, Roadkill defeated Tony Mamaluke in a dark match. He then returned to OVW where he would feud with his former partner Kasey James trading victories in tag and singles matches until James was called up to the main roster. Roadkill was then moved back up to the main roster on August 1 in a dark match loss against Stevie Richards. After a near six-month hiatus from WWE and OVW TV, Roadkill made his return to OVW on February 17, 2007 as Braddock losing to Shawn Spears. On February 21 at the OVW TV Tapings, he defeated Mike Tolar in a dark match in which his name was tweaked to Tony Braddock. Over the next four weeks he would defeat jobbers in dark matches at OVW tapings. He would continue his win streak defeating Chris Rombola in a televised match. However this would end as he would be defeated by Nick Nemeth in a 3-Way match that also involved Jacob Duncan. After an 8-month hiatus from WWE TV he returned under the name of \\"Antoni Polaski\\" and defeated Val Venis on the April 30 edition of Raw in a match taped for Heat and on the May 4 edition of SmackDown he would defeat Funaki in a match taped for Velocity. He would then return to OVW at the TV Tapings on May 9 defeating Mike Hutter in a dark match. On May 30 at the TV Tapings, Polaski was entered into a tournament to see who would face The Miz at Six Flags on June 8. Polaski would defeat Chet the Jett in the first round and Jake Hager in the semi finals but lose to Atlas DaBone in the final round. On June 13 at the OVW TV Tapings, Polaski would defeat Chet the Jett to earn the right to challenge Santino Marella for the Intercontental Championship in his first major WWE Title match. On June 22 at OVW Six Flags, he would challenge Marella for the title. After this Polaski began participating in $2500 Bodyslam Challenges, where if someone could Bodyslam him, he would give them $2500. After defeating jobbers, Jacob Duncan beat him by disqualification thus starting a feud between the two. On July 18 at the OVW TV Tapings, he and Duncan participated in an OVW Royal Rumble to see who would fight John Cena at OVW Six Flags on July 17, but it was won by Shawn Spears. Polaski would defeat Duncan three times in a $2500 Bodyslam Challenge but on August 10 at OVW Six Flags, Duncan would become the first person to defeat Polaski in such a challenge. They would continue to feud with indecisive endings like disqualification and double count outs until they had their final match on October 31 at OVW TV Tapings where Duncan defeated Polaski in a Halloween Hardcore Match. He would then start to team with Vladimir Kozlov with moderate success before going back to singles matches. His last match on OVW TV was on January 2, 2008 where he defeated Lupe Viscara. He would then have his final match for WWE challenging OVW Heavyweight Champion Matt Sydal for the title at a house show in a losing effort. Roadkill was released from WWE on February 4, 2008. Retirement When Depoli was released from WWE, he retired from professional wrestling. On October 6, 2012, 4 years after being released from WWE, Roadkill wrestled again with Doring, defeating F.B.I. in the first House of Hardcore show. Professional wrestling style and persona Roadkill used the character of an Amish from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, known by the nicknames \\"The Angry Amish Warrior\\", \\"The Angry Amish Chicken Plucker\\" and \\"The Killmeister\\" and used Soul Coughing's song \\"Super Bon Bon\\" as his entrance theme song in ECW.

The brand is currently owned and distributed by Hornby. History Scalextric is a track based slot car racing system first invented by Fred (B F) Francis.https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/politics/new-ps84m-council-homes- keep-memory-scalextric-inventor-alive-994842 Scalextric was first made in Havant, Hampshire in 1956. The forerunner to Scalextric was Scalex, which Francis first produced through the company Minimodels Ltd which he had founded in 1947. The company was based in London and made tinplate toys and models. Early products included the Startex toy car range and the very popular Scalex, which was introduced in 1952. Scalex was a range of toy racing cars with clockwork motors which were activated by pulling out the steering wheel. In 1952 Minimodels moved to a larger factory in New Lane, Havant to meet the growing demand for the toy cars. At the peak of its popularity, over 7,000 Scalex models were being produced weekly. By 1956 the novelty of clockwork racing cars had worn off and sales began to fall. Eventually the future of the company and its one hundred employees was threatened. In an attempt to revive his company’s flagging fortunes, Fred Francis began to look at alternatives. He was inspired by seeing model car racing tracks, but wanted to develop the player’s control of the car so as to increase the sense of competition. He experimented by putting small electric motors into Scalex cars and running them on model railway track. Next he introduced rubber slotted track and gave the cars a ‘gimbal’ wheel to pick up the electric current in the groove of the track. Original tin-plate cars had one hard plastic rear wheel and one rubber- tyred wheel, with gave different handling characteristics for left and right corners. Power was supplied by batteries hidden in a little cardboard hut, with players having their own on-off button to control their cars. Scalex- electric became Scalextric. Scalextric was unveiled at the Harrogate Toy Fair in 1957 to immediate acclaim. It appealed to both adults and children, combining speed, competition and the glamour of Formula One motor racing. Demand for the toy was immense and the Minimodels factory struggled to keep up with the orders. In 1958 Fred Francis sold the Minimodels company to Lines Brothers (who operated as \\"Tri-ang\\"). The popularity of Scalextric continued. In 1960 plastic bodies replaced the original tinplate and in 1961 production moved to a new factory in the Leigh Park area of Havant. By 1964 Scalextric was being advertised as ‘the most complete model motor racing system in the world’. Production of Scalextric was transferred to Rovex in 1968 (although the Minimodels factory remained open until the early 1970s). It is now owned by Hornby Hobbies of England. Products A Porsche 997 Scalextric model Electric pick-up brushes on the bottom of a Scalextric model The first model Francis introduced in his Scalex line of tin-plate clockwork cars was the Jaguar XK120. These 1:32 scale models had some unique features including a clockwork motor which was not wound by a key but by a 'fifth wheel' device. This wheel is found under the chassis behind the front axle and works by pressing the car down on a hard surface and being pulled backwards. This wound the clockwork motor and when the car was released it shot forward at speed. The Scalex range expanded to include six cars; the MG TF, Austin Healey 100, Aston Martin DB2, Jaguar 2.4 Saloon, Maserati 250F and Ferrari 375. The last 2 were in a slightly different 1:28 scale. Scalex was very successful: at one point the company was producing up to 7,000 cars a week. Later cars also featured a steerable front axle which could be set at an angle and the cars would then run in an arc. Most Scalextric models are 1:32 scale, though between 1968 and 1970 Super 124 cars and track were manufactured at 1:24 scale. In 1994 Micro Scalextric at 1:64 scale was introduced. Cars and track are not compatible between scales. At the beginning of the 21st century, Scalextric track underwent a major redesign to make it easier to assemble. The new design is known as Scalextric Sport and can be connected to the original track using special adaptor pieces. The new track was designed to be compatible with all earlier 1:32 cars. Many other manufacturers, including the likes of Fly, Slot.it, SCX, Airfix/MRRC, Carrera and Ninco, produce cars that can run on Scalextric track with minor or no modification. In 2004 Scalextric Sport Digital (SSD) was introduced, with which up to four digital cars can be raced in a single slot. The cars can change from one slot to another using special slot-lane change tracks, the lane change or otherwise being controlled by a button on the throttle. Sport Digital cars will run on analogue layouts without modification, but analogue cars require a digital decoder to be installed before they can run on a digital layout. Many of the original Scalextric cars can be fitted with a digital decoder depending on available space within the body shell. Performance of converted cars on a digital system can vary, but enthusiasts have been able to successfully convert a wide range of cars, both from Scalextric and other brands. As use of Scalextric Digital has increased, a community has established itself where users have developed enhanced powerbase functionality, fuel management and timing systems for increased realism. To convert Scalextric Sport into Scalextric Digital requires a digital power base, power supply (transformer), lane changing track (to utilise the full benefits), and digital controllers. In late 2010, Scalextric released a revised six-car digital powerbase, C7042. This powerbase includes a separate screen which aids set up and also displays race information such as lap times. The company worked closely with customers when developing the new system. The result includes features such as yellow flag options for dealing with crashed cars, ghost cars to race against which can run and change lanes automatically, and the ability to race in analogue mode for older models that have not been converted to digital. In Spain, Hornby Scalextric is marketed under the brand Superslot, as the Scalextric brand is owned there by Scale Competition Xtreme, whose products are sold internationally under the SCX brand. Whilst there are some common standards, parts of the two ranges, particularly in their digital offerings, are not compatible. Sets Scalextric is typically sold as a set containing enough track to make a circuit, the necessary power supply and throttles and two cars. The cars are usually based on real vehicles from Formula 1, A1 Grand Prix, NASCAR, rallying, touring, or Le Mans, or based on ordinary road going cars. A number of novelty sets have been produced; for example, horse racing sets and 360 degree sets. The latter, produced sporadically since the 1960s, have a specially made guide that enables the car to run back the way it has come by spinning through 180 degrees. Power and control Scalextric is controlled with a hand-held plunger, connected by wire to a connector on the set. A set normally has two to six plungers included. Mounted in the track (for each lane) are two metal rails, which for Analogue carry the DC current from the controllers, or for Digital have constant AC current passed through them, in either case picked up by two metal braids or plates on the underside of the racing cars.https://www.actionslotracing.co.uk/pages/advice- tips#C6http://www.scalextric- car.co.uk/Catalogue/Articles/Article_Scalextric_Cars_and_Old_New_Track.htm  TV and film licensing  Since the 1960s, Scalextric have offered TV and film tie-ins, beginning with the now rare and valuable James Bond 007 set featuring an Aston Martin with action features as shown in the film Goldfinger. Even the 'baddie' car in this set, a Mercedes, had action features of its own whilst the set also sported many other unique action points and props. It was some time before Scalextric returned to licensing in the 1970s first with The Amazing Spider-Man (the 1970s series), which had specially liveried TR7 cars and white track. Then, in the 1980s, came the original TV series based Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, Knight Rider and then Tim Burton's Batman film. Since then the franchises have grown to include Batman Begins, The Simpsons, The Transformers movie, James Bond 007 films Quantum of Solace, Skyfall, GoldenEye and Spectre, Starsky and Hutch, The Italian Job (models from both the original and re-made films), Top Gear, Star Wars and the Pixar/Disney Movie 'Toy Story. Many of these have appeared in both 1:32 and 1:64 scales. Scalextric also produced a The Dukes of Hazzard General Lee car and more recently a twin car pack with licensing from the Fast and the Furious film franchise. Scalextric has also recently licensed the Need for Speed brand from Electronic Arts and has produced a set based on the popular video game series. On 22 November 2004, thieves stole 2,500 Simpsons Scalextric sets from the back of a lorry which was parked near services on the M2 motorway in England. Vehicles In addition to various types of cars, Scalextric vehicles have included motorbikes, sidecars, go-karts, pickup trucks, SUVs, racing trucks, articulated trucks, horses, skateboards and bicycles. Track Standard track consists of straights of various lengths and corners of different radii and degree of turn. Special track includes several different styles of chicane, cross-over tracks, crossroad track and humpback bridge. Novelty pieces of track have included pit lane tracks, Le Mans start, blow-out track and loop-the-loop tracks.Scalextric history There are five generations of 1:32 scale Scalextric track: #Original Scalextric Track (Mk. 1): This was made from rubber with thin, vertical electrical connectors, and held together with separate metal clips. This track had white lines between the lanes. Track produced during the 'Minimodels era' was slightly glossy and curved sections had side protrusions to allow for the attachment of the supplied crash barrier. Later 'Triang era' Mk 1 track dispensed with these, possibly because they thwarted future additions like outer radius curves. The later iteration had a more realistic matt finish to its road surface. The earliest track had a dedicated 'power straight' for the connections to each lane, whereas the later used power clips that were held in place between the contacts of any two track sections including curves. It was during this transition that the original on/off button control gave way to hand-held plungers with a greater degree of speed control. #Original Scalextric Track (Mk. 2): Released in 1962, the material became plastic, electrical connections were through wider, horizontal pins, and the track was held together by two integrated circular, spoon-shaped pins and sockets moulded into each end. Converter pieces were available to link the two types. It is now known as Classic track. Classic track is compatible with another leading brand, SCX's classic track. #Scalextric Sport: Released in 2001, another plastic track, but with a smoother surface. The track connectors are square and slot into place unlike the ring shaped Classic track ones. Converter pieces are available to link to Classic track. #Scalextric Digital: Released in 2004, Scalextric Digital is compatible with Sport. It allows up to 6 cars on a 2 lane track at one time, with each car fully controllable. This was a feature previously unavailable from Scalextric. #Scalextric Start: Released in 2010, Scalextric Start aims to be a basic track for children. It has only one type of straight and corner, and each set can be made up into various layouts; the cars included in the sets are fantasy models, which reduce manufacturers' licensing costs, and a converter track piece is available to allow cars to cross from Start track to Sport and back again. Scalextric racing in popular culture In 2009, BBC Top Gear presenter James May announced plans to recreate the full length Brooklands racing track using Scalextric track and cars. This was undertaken with a team of 350 volunteers building the track from an uncounted number of pieces of Scalextric track, navigating ponds and roads, closely following the route of the old Brooklands track. This event broke the Guinness World Record for the longest ever Scalextric track in the world, intended to measure the original of the original Brooklands circuit but in reality recording in length, because of the need to navigate modern features that block the original course. The episode was first shown on BBC2 on 17 November 2009 as part of James May's Toy Stories.

It became available to the public in October of that year and used a much smaller track geometry to the standard Scalextric product. Many of the Micro MR-1 models were re-badged products manufactured by Marchon, Inc. In 1995, again at the Olympia toy fair, a new track system was introduced along with new vehicles. At the same time Scalextric Micro MR-1 was re-branded as Micro Scalextric. The Micro Scalextric range is aimed at children four years of age or older and has a scale of 1:64 and is often, incorrectly, described as HO scale (1:87). There is also a 'My first Scalextric' range, aimed at 3 year olds. In February 2019 a new track system was introduced. Warner Bros have licensed a number of Looney Tunes characters for use in the Micro Scalextric range of products. The latest (2019) range Micro Scalextric slot car motors run on 9v, which is different to earlier Micro Scalextric vehicles.

Biography Camille Guérin was born in Poitiers to a family of modest means. His father died of tuberculosis in 1882 (as well as his wife, in 1918). He studied veterinary medicine at the Ecole Nationale Vétérinaire d'Alfort from 1892 to 1896, working, while a student, as an assistant to pathologist Edmond Nocard (1850–1903). In 1897, he joined the Institut Pasteur de Lille (Lille, France) and started to work with its director, French physician, bacteriologist and immunologist Albert Calmette (1863–1933). He started as a technician in charge of preparing Calmette's serum (antivenom against snake bites) and the vaccine against smallpox. He considerably improved the production techniques of the latter by using rabbits as intermediate hosts and developed a method to quantify the remaining virulence of these vaccines. At Lille, he was promoted to Head of Laboratory in 1900. Thereafter, from 1905 to 1915, and from 1918 to 1928 he devoted himself to the research on a vaccine against tuberculosis, in close association with Calmette, until his death in 1933. He discovered in 1905 that the bovine tuberculosis bacillum, the Mycobacterium bovis, could immunize the animals without causing the disease. Henceforth, he and Calmette developed ways of attenuate the pathogenic activity of Mycobacterium, using successive transferrals of culture. In 1908, after successfully obtaining an immunologically active preparation that could be used to produce a vaccine, he published with Calmette the results of what was named the BCG. In 1919 he was promoted again, this time to Head of Services. Finally, in 1921, after 230 passages of the BCG culture, they obtained an effective vaccine that could be used in humans. In 1928 he moved to Paris to become the director of the Tuberculosis Service at the Pasteur Institute. In 1939 he became vice- president of the \\"Comité National de Défense contre la Tuberculose\\" (National Defense Committee against Tuberculosis). In 1948 Guérin was chairman of the First International Congress on BCG. He was also President of the Veterinary Academy of France (1949), and President of the Academy of Medicine (1951). In 1955, the French Academy of Sciences awarded him the Scientific Grand Prix. He died aged 88, in the Hôpital Pasteur in Paris. References  External links * Jean Marie Camille Guérin.

Maas was selected to the Pro Bowl in 1986 and 1987. In 1984 Maas was named The NFL Rookie of the Year by the Associated Press. He worked as a commentator for Fox Sports from 1996 to 2007. From 1998 to 2001, he served as studio anchor and game analyst for NFL games. Bill's early years were spent in suburban Pennsylvania where he grew up alongside his sister Lizanne (Annie), his brother Murray Xavier, and his adopted Vietnamese brother, Ngo. Legal problems On July 6, 2007, Maas was arrested for drug and weapons possession after a traffic stop in East Peoria, Illinois. He was released from jail two days later. The USA Today reported August 7, 2007: Maas, 45, and a passenger in his Hummer, Sarah J. Murphy, 27, were arrested late Friday by Illinois State Police. During the stop on Illinois Route 116, police indicated that Maas seemed nervous, which prompted police to request a search of the vehicle, to which Maas consented. The search turned up a .22-caliber revolver, five grams of suspected marijuana, six grams of suspected cocaine and 28 pills of Ecstasy, according to police. Both Maas and Murphy were charged with possession of a controlled substance and possession of marijuana. Maas was also booked on a charge of unlawful use of a weapon. On September 5, 2007, Maas was questioned and released following an incident at Kansas City International Airport in which authorities reportedly found a loaded 9mm Glock in a bag brought by the former football player to the airport before attempting to board a plane. The gun was confiscated at a screening station and Maas was taken to the airport police station for questioning, at which point he claimed to have picked up the wrong bag before coming to the airport. High school career Bill Maas played football at Marple Newtown High School but his athletic skills were overlooked, in part because of his team's lack of success on the field. During his senior year, the Tigers finished with a 1-9 record. The only school that expressed interest in him was the University of Pittsburgh, a college football powerhouse. College career Bill Maas spearheaded Pitt's defensive fronts of the early 1980s with his play at tackle. In 1980, he was part of an elite Pitt team that included future NFL stars Tim Lewis, Jimbo Covert, Dan Marino, Russ Grimm, Mark May, Hugh Green, and Rickey Jackson. He established himself early when as a freshman he blocked a punt and recorded a sack in Pitt's 1980 Gator Bowl victory over South Carolina. He then became a starter for his remaining three years with the Panthers, earning All-America honors in 1982. Maas played in the East–West Shrine Game. NFL career Maas was the Chiefs first-round draft pick in 1984, the fifth player taken overall. He lived up to his first- round status, being named the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year despite missing two games. After a career-high seven sacks in 1985, he matched that total the next season and was awarded his first Pro Bowl nod. He went back again to the Pro Bowl in the strike-shortened 1987 season after getting six sacks and scoring a touchdown off of a fumble recovery. Maas got off to a fast start in 1988, getting four sacks and a safety in his first seven games. He then got hurt in the eighth game and missed the rest of the season. The 1989 season was the first year in his career he did not have a sack, as it was shortened to 10 games because of injury. He did score the last touchdown of his career off of a fumble. Kansas City moved him to defensive end in 1990. He had 5.5 sacks and a safety that season. After an injury-filled 1992 season, he joined the Green Bay Packers. He spent most of the year backing up John Jurkovic at nose tackle. His 40 career sacks is tied with Mike Bell as the eighth most in Kansas City Chiefs history, as of 2020, and is the most by either a defensive tackle or nose tackle. Bill Maas is the first nose tackle in Chiefs history to make the Pro Bowl. He was the first Chief ever to win a Rookie of the Year Award, and he might be the best nose tackle in franchise history. During his career, Maas won acclaim for his relentless pass rushing ability and was selected twice for the Pro Bowl, as well as being named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year. Post NFL career After retiring from pro football, he spent 12 years broadcasting NFL games for Fox Sports. While commercial real estate is his third career, Maas began investing in strip malls, storage units, and rental properties during his playing and broadcasting careers. “Commercial real estate was a natural fit and progression,” says Maas, director of real estate services at Block and Company in Kansas City, Mo.

Aerial perspective as viewed towards a sunset, with the colour shifting toward red as a result of Rayleigh scattering Dai Jin, \\"Landscape in the Style of Yan Wengui\\", Early Ming Dynasty (1368-1644); a Chinese landscape painting using \\"atmospheric perspective\\" to show recession in space Frans Koppelaar, Landscape near Bologna, 2001; a painting depicting aerial perspective: distant objects appear paler, of lower contrast, and bluer than nearer objects. Aerial perspective or atmospheric perspective refers to the effect the atmosphere has on the appearance of an object as viewed from a distance. As the distance between an object and a viewer increases, the contrast between the object and its background decreases, and the contrast of any markings or details within the object also decreases. The colours of the object also become less saturated and shift towards the background colour, which is usually bluish, but may be some other colour under certain conditions (for instance, reddish around sunrise or sunset). History Atmospheric perspective was used in Pompeian Second Style paintings, one of the Pompeian Styles, dating as early as 30 BCE. A notable example is the Gardenscape from the Villa of Livia in Primaporta, Italy. Aerial perspective was used in paintings from the Netherlands in the 15th century, and explanations of its effects were with varying degrees of accuracy written by polymaths such as Leon Battista Alberti and Leonardo da Vinci. The latter used aerial perspective in many of his paintings such as the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper. However, art historians note that it is lacking in works by some artists of the same period, such as Raphael. Optics The major component affecting the appearance of objects during daylight is scattering of light, called skylight, into the line of sight of the viewer. Scattering occurs from molecules of the air and also from larger particles in the atmosphere such as water vapour and smoke (see haze). Scattering adds the sky light as a veiling luminance onto the light from the object, reducing its contrast with the background sky light. Skylight usually contains more light of short wavelength than other wavelengths (this is why the sky usually appears blue), which is why distant objects appear bluish (see Rayleigh scattering for detailed explanation). A minor component is scattering of light out of the line of sight of the viewer. Under daylight, this either augments the contrast loss (e.g., for white objects) or opposes it (for dark objects). At night there is effectively no skylight (unless the moon is very bright), so scattering out of the line of sight becomes the major component affecting the appearance of self-luminous objects. Such objects have their contrasts reduced with the dark background, and their colours are shifted towards red. Why reducing contrast reduces clarity The ability of a person with normal visual acuity to see fine details is determined by his or her contrast sensitivity.Kelly, D. H. (1977). Visual contrast sensitivity. Optica Acta, 24, 107-129. Contrast sensitivity is the reciprocal of the smallest contrast for which a person can see a sine-wave grating. A person's contrast sensitivity function is contrast sensitivity as a function of spatial frequency. Normally, peak contrast sensitivity is at about 4 cycles per degree of visual angle. At higher spatial frequencies, comprising finer and finer lines, contrast sensitivity decreases, until at about 40 cycles per degree even the brightest of bright lines and the darkest of dark lines cannot be seen. The high spatial frequencies in an image give it its fine details.Blake, R., & Sekuler, R. (2006). Perception (5th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill. Reducing the contrast of an image reduces the visibility of these high spatial frequencies because contrast sensitivity for them is already poor. This is how a reduction of contrast can reduce the clarity of an image—by removing its fine details. It is important to emphasize that reducing the contrast is not the same as blurring an image. Blurring is accomplished by reducing the contrast only of the high spatial frequencies. Aerial perspective reduces the contrast of all spatial frequencies. In art In art, especially painting, aerial perspective refers to the technique of creating an illusion of depth by depicting distant objects as paler, less detailed, and usually bluer than near objects. (One caution: in common speech, the words perspective and viewpoint tend to be used interchangeably; however, in art, aerial perspective does not imply an aerial viewpoint, such as that forming the basis of the aerial landscape genre. The example by Frans Koppelaar pictured here shows the difference. This landscape is a good example of aerial perspective; however, it is not an aerial landscape, since the observer is apparently standing on the ground.)

The Ember, the largest channel, flows in an easterly and then northerly direction around the reservoir, past part of Esher; the Mole flows around the other side past West Molesey. The two rivers then flow side by side approximately north east and merge 400 metres before joining the River Thames at the eastern end of East Molesey opposite Hampton Court Palace on the south side of the last non-tidal reach, which is above Teddington Lock. History The Ember was until the 1930s a distributary. As such the River Mole was similar to two other Thames tributaries, the Colne and the Cherwell, in having more than one channel in its lowest stretch. The River Mole flowed into the River Thames separately slightly further upstream at the point where Hampton Court Bridge crosses the river, with the land between the Mole and Ember being known as Cigarette Island. However, during the early 1930s, when Hampton Court Way and the bridge were built, the River Mole was redirected to flow into the River Ember forming a widened and straightened channel. There have been further alterations to the courses of these two rivers in a major flood prevention scheme since serious flooding in the area in 1947 and 1968.East Molesey history Surreyproperty.com Close to its start, Ember Mill stood on an island in the Ember reached from a footbridge at the end of Orchard Lane by Imber Court, Thames Ditton. The mill was demolished around 1837 and the sluices and waterfalls on either side are all that remain to indicate the site. The mill was originally a corn mill but was later used for manufacturing brass and iron wire. This part of the Ember is bypassed by the new channel of the flood prevention scheme, but a small flow runs into the old course to keep it looking largely as it used to.A Guide To The Industrial Archaeology Of The Borough Of Elmbridge Fishing There is a section of the river at Old Cow Common, East Molesey, where there is free fishing for pike (to 15 pounds), bream, carp, chub, dace, perch, roach, catfish (to 22 lb), tench, bullhead (to 3 lb), ell, orfe, goldfish and rudd.Fresh water directory See also *Tributaries of the River Thames *List of rivers of England ReferencesExternal links *Multimap *Photo of River Ember flood relief scheme under construction in 1981 0Ember 1Ember ","title":"River Ember"},{"id":"1335058","text":"Ashraf () is an Arabic name meaning \\"most honorable one\\" or \\"very noble\\".

Anyone can make a nomination. Nominations are then endorsed by the senior management team to proceed to the next stage. The Awards year culminates in a televised UK Ceremony, held in the Autumn, where awards are given out in various categories. The show, Britain's Classroom Heroes, is broadcast on BBC2.  The Teaching Awards Trust  The Teaching Awards were established by Lord Puttnam CBE in 1998 and are managed by an independent charity, the Teaching Awards Trust. The Teaching Awards Trust aims to celebrate excellence and promote best practice in education. The Oscar award winning actress Emma Thompson became the president of the Teaching Awards in 2009. She said \\"I owe so much of what I've done to my fantastic teachers at school and at university and it's exciting to join in celebrating what is probably the most important profession of them all\\".  Goals  The Teaching Awards Trust was initially established to regenerate national pride in the teaching profession. The Trust has been successful in achieving this aim and has repositioned itself as a centre of excellence in education with the following aims: * promote teaching as a career * disseminate best practice * encourage the involvement of other stakeholders in education * engage with a wider audience at a national level  Profile  The Awards are supported by all the main political parties, the Department for Education in England, the Department of Education in Northern Ireland, the Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly Government as well as all the national teaching unions and associations. The Teaching Awards Trust works in partnership with the BBC. The UK Ceremony is a produced in conjunction with the BBC and is shown on BBC Two in a primetime slot as a showcase of excellence in education. During the programme, winning teachers are presented with a Plato award, designed by sculptor Glynis Owen and based on her work titled 'The Thinking Man.'

His descendants controlled the papacy for the next 100 years. Biography Theophylact was the hereditary count of Tusculum, a small hill town near the vicinity of Rome. He is mentioned for the first time in a document of 901 as palatine iudex (palace judge, or leader of the militia) of Emperor Louis the Blind. He remained in Rome, commanding a group of soldiers after the emperor’s return to Provence in 902, and was prominent in the overthrow of Antipope Christopher in January 904, whom he very likely ordered to be killed whilst in prison later that year. Theophylact formed an alliance with Duke Alberic I of Spoleto, and with their combined backing, Pope Sergius III was elected in Christopher’s place.Williams, pg. 11 During his pontificate, Theophylact became Sergius’ sacri palatii vestararius and magister militum, effectively seizing control of the city. He was also granted other honorific titles, such as senator, glorissimus dux, and dominus urbis.Williams, pg. 11; Gregorovius, pg. 251 Sometime between the end of Sergius III’ pontificate and the start of John X’s,Gregorovius, pgs. 252-253 Theophylact was elected as the head of Rome, under the centuries-old title of Roman consul by the city's nobility. As per the ancient office, this must have been for a year only, as in 915, he is referred to as a senator only, although first among the listed nobility.Gregorovius, pg. 254 In this capacity, Theophylact was able to dominate the papal electoral process, with all popes until his death in 925 chosen after he had hand-picked them. Theophylact’s rule of Rome was shared to a large degree with his wife Theodora, who was styled senatrix and serenissima vestaratrix of Rome. It was by her suggestion that the popes who followed Sergius III, Anastasius III and Lando, were chosen by her husband for the papal see. Then in 914, she prevailed upon him to support her alleged lover as pope, having him installed as John X (although it has been suggested that John was in fact related to either Theodora or Theophylact).Gregorovius, pg. 252 Theophylact worked closely with the able John X, who supported Theophylact’s overall objectives with regards to strengthening the imperial presence in Italy by supporting Berengar I of Italy. He fought alongside John X against the Saracens at the Battle of Garigliano in 915, and was the pope’s principal political support until his death in either 924 or 925.Williams, pg. 13 Theophylact had two daughters with Theodora: Marozia and Theodora. In the longer term, the heirs of Theophylact, the Tusculani, were the rivals of the Crescentii in controlling Rome, and placed several popes on the Chair of St Peter. Their eventual heirs were the Colonna family. Reputation It is now believed that Theodora’s influence over Theophylact was overstated by contemporary chroniclers such as Liutprand of Cremona, who wished to exaggerate the corruption of the Roman and papal court, as a counterpoint to rulers such as Alberic I of Spoleto, and the future emperor Otto I, whom Liutprand later served. The charges of adultery against Theodora, the use of the term “harlot”, and the presumption that she was using her “feminine wiles” to prostitute herself in order to influence her husband and appoint numerous lovers to important posts were used to tarnish the rule of Theophylact and his successors. Later historians, influenced by the moral tone of this critique, described the influence of Theodora and her descendants over the papacy as the “pornocracy” or the “Rule of the Harlots”. Modern historians now instead use the term Saeculum obscurum to describe the period when the papacy was under the direct control of the Roman nobility, in particular when it was under the domination of the family of Theophylact.

History The threads of the story can be traced back as far as the 1980s on bulletin board systems, old xerox mail art networks and early zines. The aim was to create a fictional story line, and embed it in various media cultures to establish backstory. It may have started as an in-joke, or the first alternate reality game (ARG), a work of transmedia storytelling or as a memetic experiment, to see how far the meme could spread or a combination of all of the above. The story eventually used print, radio, television and digital mediums (CD-ROM, DVD, Internet, BBS) in its dissemination. The initial ground rules acknowledged the possibility that such an experiment could end up going down darker paths, and they specifically ruled out Ong's Hat being used for cult-like activity. Even though it is a fiction, the tale may be based on earlier works.Aspray, William. \\"The Princeton Mathematics Community in the 1930s, Transcript Number 41 (PMC41)\\". The Trustees of Princeton University, 1985 Joseph Matheny eventually concluded the project. \\"Ong’s Hat was more of an experiment in transmedia storytelling than what we would now consider to be an ARG but its DNA – the concept of telling a story across various platforms and new media – is evident in every alternate reality game that came after.\\" Plot The urban legend (or alternate history) states that a facility manned by renegade Princeton professors conducted quantum physics and chaos theory experiments, and according to conspiracy theories, discovered a new theory for dimensional travel using a device called The EGG. This device was to later inspire a children's TV series called Galidor to use an interdimensional travel device of the same name. Ong's Hat is often cited as the first ARGs on many lists of alternate reality games. They were largely based in the ghost town of Ong's Hat, New Jersey, hence the name of the project.

There are two forms: cash-flow insolvency and balance-sheet insolvency. Cash-flow insolvency is when a person or company has enough assets to pay what is owed, but does not have the appropriate form of payment. For example, a person may own a large house and a valuable car, but not have enough liquid assets to pay a debt when it falls due. Cash-flow insolvency can usually be resolved by negotiation. For example, the bill collector may wait until the car is sold and the debtor agrees to pay a penalty. Balance-sheet insolvency is when a person or company does not have enough assets to pay all of their debts. The person or company might enter bankruptcy, but not necessarily. Once a loss is accepted by all parties, negotiation is often able to resolve the situation without bankruptcy. A company that is balance-sheet insolvent may still have enough cash to pay its next bill on time. However, most laws will not let the company pay that bill unless it will directly help all their creditors. For example, an insolvent farmer may be allowed to hire people to help harvest the crop, because not harvesting and selling the crop would be even worse for his creditors. It has been suggested that the speaker or writer should either say technical insolvency or actual insolvency in order to always be clear - where technical insolvency is a synonym for balance sheet insolvency, which means that its liabilities are greater than its assets, and actual insolvency is a synonym for the first definition of insolvency (\\"Insolvency is the inability of a debtor to pay their debt.\\"). While technical insolvency is a synonym for balance-sheet insolvency, cash-flow insolvency and actual insolvency are not synonyms. The term \\"cash-flow insolvent\\" carries a strong (but perhaps not absolute) connotation that the debtor is balance-sheet solvent, whereas the term \\"actually insolvent\\" does not. Technical definitions Cash-flow insolvency involves a lack of liquidity to pay debts as they fall due. Balance sheet insolvency involves having negative net assets—where liabilities exceed assets. Insolvency is not a synonym for bankruptcy, which is a determination of insolvency made by a court of law with resulting legal orders intended to resolve the insolvency. Accounting insolvency happens when total liabilities exceed total assets (negative net worth).Fundamentals of Corporate Finance, Ross-Westerfield- Jordan, 10th e, p.549Downes, John, and Jordan Elliot. Goodman. Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms. Hauppauge, NY: Barron's Educational Series, 2003. Print.UK Insolvency Act 1986, Section 123 Consequences The principal focus of modern insolvency legislation and business debt restructuring practices no longer rests on the liquidation and elimination of insolvent entities but on the remodeling of the financial and organizational structure of debtors experiencing financial distress so as to permit the rehabilitation and continuation of their business. This is known as business turnaround or business recovery. Implementing a business turnaround may take many forms, including keep and restructure, sale as a going concern, or wind-down and exit. In some jurisdictions, it is an offence under the insolvency laws for a corporation to continue in business while insolvent. In others (like the United States with its Chapter 11 provisions), the business may continue under a declared protective arrangement while alternative options to achieve recovery are worked out. Increasingly, legislatures have favored alternatives to winding up companies for good. It can be, in several jurisdictions, grounds for a civil action or even an offence, to continue to pay some creditors in preference to other creditors once a state of insolvency is reached.Enterprise Bankruptcy Law of the People's Republic of China (August 27, 2006), Chapter 2, Section 2, Article 16. Debt restructuring Debt restructurings are typically handled by professional insolvency and restructuring practitioners, and are usually less expensive and a preferable alternative to bankruptcy. Debt restructuring is a process that allows a private or public company - or a sovereign entity - facing cash flow problems and financial distress, to reduce and renegotiate its delinquent debts in order to improve or restore liquidity and rehabilitate so that it can continue its operations. Government debt Although the term \\"bankrupt\\" may be used referring to a government, sovereign states do not go bankrupt. This is so because bankruptcy is governed by national law; there exists no entity to take over such a government and distribute assets to creditors. Governments can be insolvent in terms of not having money to pay obligations when they are due. If a government does not meet an obligation, it is in \\"default\\". As governments are sovereign entities, persons who hold debt of the government cannot seize the assets of the government to re-pay the debt. The recourse for the creditor is to request to be repaid at least some of what is owed. However, in most cases, debt in default is refinanced by further borrowing or monetized by issuing more currency (which typically results in inflation and may result in hyperinflation). Law Insolvency regimes around the world have evolved in very different ways, with laws focusing on different strategies for dealing with the insolvent. The outcome of an insolvent restructuring can be very different depending on the laws of the state in which the insolvency proceeding is run, and in many cases different stakeholders in a company may hold the advantage in different jurisdictions.Joseph Swanson and Peter Marshall, Houlihan Lokey and Lyndon Norley, Kirkland & Ellis International LLP (2008). A Practitioner's Guide to Corporate Restructuring. City & Financial Publishing, 1st edition Australia In Australia Corporate insolvency is governed by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Companies can be put into Voluntary Administration, Creditors Voluntary Liquidation & Court Liquidation. Secured creditors with registered charges are able to appoint Receivers and Receivers & Managers depending on their charge. Canada In Canada, bankruptcy and insolvency are generally regulated by the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. An alternative regime is available to larger companies (or affiliated groups) under the Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act, where total debts exceed $5 million.  Germany  In Germany, insolvency proceedings are regulated by the Insolvency Act (Insolvenzordnung), in effect since 1999 but with significant changes in 2012.Insolvency Statute Bundesamt für Justiz The goal of insolvency law is the equal and best satisfaction of creditors. If the interests of creditors are respected, insolvent companies are offered different ways to restructure their businesses, for example by implementing an 'insolvency plan' (Insolvenzplan). While regular insolvency proceedings are led by a court-appointed insolvency administrator, 'debtor-in- possession' proceedings are common since the legislative changes in 2012.  India  In India, bankruptcy and insolvency are generally regulated by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) is the regulator for overseeing insolvency proceedings and entities like Insolvency Professional Agencies (IPA), Insolvency Professionals (IP) and Information Utilities (IU) in India. South Africa In South Africa, owners of businesses that had at any stage traded insolvently (i.e. that had a balance-sheet insolvency) become personally liable for the business' debts. Trading insolvently is often regarded as normal business practice in South Africa, as long as the business is able to fulfill its debt obligations when they fall due. Switzerland Under Swiss law, insolvency or foreclosure may lead to the seizure and auctioning off of assets (generally in the case of private individuals) or to bankruptcy proceedings (generally in the case of registered commercial entities). Turkey Turkish insolvency law is regulated by Enforcement And Bankruptcy Law (Code No: 2004, Original Name: İcra ve İflas Kanunu). Main concept of the insolvency law is very similar to Swiss and German insolvency laws. Enforcement methods are realizing pledged property, seizure of assets and bankruptcy. United KingdomInsolvency Act 1986= In the United Kingdom, the term bankruptcy is reserved for individuals. Insolvency is defined both in terms of cash flow and in terms of balance sheet in the UK Insolvency Act 1986, Section 123, which reads in part: A company which is insolvent may be put into liquidation (sometimes referred to as winding-up). The directors and shareholders can instigate the liquidation process without court involvement by a shareholder resolution and the appointment of a licensed Insolvency Practitioner as liquidator. However, the liquidation will not be effective legally without the convening of a meeting of creditors who have the opportunity to appoint a liquidator of their own choice. This process is known as creditors voluntary liquidation (CVL), as opposed to members voluntary liquidation (MVL) which is for solvent companies. Alternatively, a creditor can petition the court for a winding-up order which, if granted, will place the company into what is called compulsory liquidation or winding up by the court. The liquidator realises the assets of the company and distributes funds realised to creditors according to their priorities, after the deduction of costs. In the case of Sole Trader Insolvency, the insolvency options include Individual Voluntary Arrangements and Bankruptcy. =Procedures= It can be a civil and even a criminal offence for directors to allow a company to continue to trade whilst insolvent. However, two new insolvency procedures were introduced by the Insolvency Act 1986 which aim to provide time for the rescue of a company or, at least, its business. These are Administration and Company Voluntary Arrangement: *Administration is a procedure to protect a company from its creditors in order for it to be able to make significant operational changes or restructuring so that it could continue as a going concern, or at least in order to achieve a better outcome for creditors than via liquidation. In contrast to Chapter 11 in the US where the directors remain in control throughout that restructuring process, in the UK an Administrator is appointed who must be a licensed Insolvency Practitioner to manage the company's affairs to protect the creditors of the insolvent company and balance their respective interests. Unless the company itself is saved by this process, the company is subsequently put into liquidation to distribute the remaining funds. *A Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) is a legal agreement between the company and its creditors, based on paying a fixed amount lower than the outstanding actual debt. These are normally based on a monthly payment, and at the end of the agreed term the remaining debt is written-off. The CVA is managed by a Supervisor who must be a licensed Insolvency Practitioner. If the CVA fails, the company is usually put into liquidation. One particular type of Administration that is becoming more common is called pre pack administration (more information under administration (law)). In this process, immediately after appointment the administrator completes a pre-arranged sale of the company's business, often to its directors or owners. The process can be seen as controversial because the creditors do not have the opportunity to vote against the sale. The rationale behind the device is that the swift sale of the business may be necessary or of benefit to enable a best price to be achieved. If the sale was delayed, creditors would ultimately lose out because the price obtainable for the assets would be reduced. =Receivership= In addition to the above-mentioned corporate insolvency procedures, a creditor holding security over an asset of the company may have the power to appoint an insolvency practitioner as administrative receiver or, in Scotland, receiver. The process, latterly known as administrative receivership or, in Scotland, receivership, has existed for many years and has often resulted in a successful rescue of a company's business via a sale, but not of the company itself. Since the introduction of the collective insolvency procedure of Administration in 1986, the legislators have decided to set a shelf life on the administrative receivership or, in Scotland, receivership procedure and it is no longer possible to appoint an administrative receiver or, in Scotland, receiver under security created after 15 September 2003. In individual cases the bankruptcy estate is dealt by an official receiver, appointed by the court. In some cases the file is transferred to RTLU (OR Regional Trustee Liquidator Unit) that will assess your assets and income to see if you can contribute towards paying costs of bankruptcy or even discharge part of your debts. United States Under the Uniform Commercial Code, a person is considered to be insolvent when the party has ceased to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business, or cannot pay its debts as they become due, or is insolvent within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code. This is important because certain rights under the code may be invoked against an insolvent party which are otherwise unavailable. The United States has established insolvency regimes which aim to protect the insolvent individual or company from the creditors, and balance their respective interests. For example, see Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code. However, some state courts have begun to find individual corporate officers and directors liable for driving a company deeper into bankruptcy, under the legal theory of \\"deepening insolvency\\". In determining whether a gift or a payment to a creditor is an unlawful preference, the date of the insolvency, rather than the date of the legally declared bankruptcy, will usually be the primary consideration.

She was named for Robert Henley. Henley was launched on 3 April 1912 by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company, in Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Miss Constance Henley Kane, great-grandniece or Robert Henley; and commissioned at Boston, Massachusetts, on 6 December 1912, with Lieutenant Commander W. L. Littlefield in command. Pre-World War I After training and shakedown, Henley joined the US Atlantic Torpedo Fleet at Newport, Rhode Island, for a peacetime career of tactical exercises and training maneuvers along the coast from the Caribbean to the North Atlantic. On 22 April 1914, she joined the fleet off Tampico, Mexico, to protect American citizens and property in the face of revolution in that country. During this period, Henley also saw duty transporting refugees and supplies. With war in Europe that fall, she began Neutrality Patrol along the coast and checked belligerent vessels in American ports. World War I When America entered World War I in April 1917, Henley continued patrol along the coast and also escorted fuel ships to the destroyers guarding America's first troop convoy on 13 June. For the remainder of the war, Henley performed convoy duty along the coast and carried out anti-submarine patrol off New York harbor. Henley put in at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 22 December 1918 and decommissioned there on 12 December 1919. Inter-war period Transferred to the Coast Guard on 16 May 1924, she served in the Rum Patrol. She was originally stationed at Stapleton, New York and then transferred to New London, Connecticut. She returned to the Navy on 8 May 1931 and was sold for scrap to Michael Flynn Inc. of Brooklyn, New York on 22 August 1934.

Tuberville was the head football coach at the University of Mississippi from 1995 to 1998, Auburn University from 1999 to 2008, Texas Tech University from 2010 to 2012, and the University of Cincinnati from 2013 to 2016. Tuberville received the 2004 Walter Camp and Bear Bryant Coach of the Year awards after Auburn's 13–0 season, in which Auburn won the Southeastern Conference title and the Sugar Bowl but was left out of the BCS National Championship Game. He earned his 100th career win on October 6, 2007, a 35–7 victory over Vanderbilt. He is the only coach in Auburn football history to beat in-state rival Alabama six consecutive times. In 2015, Tuberville was the president of the American Football Coaches Association. During 2017, he worked for ESPN as a color analyst for their college football coverage. In April 2019, Tuberville announced his candidacy in the 2020 United States Senate election in Alabama. On July 14, 2020, Tuberville won the Republican nomination, defeating former Senator and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Early years Tuberville was born and raised in Camden, Arkansas, one of three children of Charles and Olive Tuberville. He graduated from Harmony Grove High School in Camden in 1972. He attended Southern Arkansas University, where he lettered in football as a safety for the Muleriders and played two years on the golf team. He received a B.S. in physical education from SAU in 1976. In 2008, he was inducted into the Southern Arkansas University Sports Hall of Fame and the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame. Coaching career Tuberville, Jack Siedlecki, Mark Richt, Randy Shannon, and Charlie Weis watch President George W. Bush speak to reporters in May 2008 Early career Tuberville first coached at Hermitage High School in Hermitage, Arkansas. He was an assistant coach at Arkansas State University. He then went through the ranks at the University of Miami, beginning as graduate assistant and ending as defensive coordinator in 1993 and winning the national championship three times during his tenure there (1986–1994). In 1994, Tuberville replaced Bob Davie as defensive coordinator under R. C. Slocum at Texas A&M; University. The Aggies went 10–0–1 that season. Ole Miss Tuberville got his first collegiate head coaching job in 1994 at the University of Mississippi. Despite taking over a Rebels team under severe NCAA scholarship sanctions, he was named the SEC Coach of the Year in 1997 by the AP. At Ole Miss, Tuberville became involved in the movement to ban Confederate flags from the football stadium by requesting that the students quit waving them during the home football games. \\"We can't recruit against the Confederate flag,\\" he said. The chancellor of Ole Miss ultimately placed a ban on sticks at football games, which effectively banned spectators from waving flags. During his tenure, Tuberville was known as the \\"Riverboat Gambler\\" for his aggressive play-calling, especially on fourth down. At Ole Miss, he said, \\"They'll have to carry me out of here in a pine box,\\" in reference to not leaving to coach at another school. Less than a week later, it was announced that he was departing for Auburn. Auburn Tuberville left Ole Miss following the 1998 season to take the head coaching job at Auburn University. At Auburn, he guided the Tigers to the top of the SEC standings, leading them to an SEC championship and the Western Division title in 2004. Under his direction, the Tigers made eight consecutive bowl appearances including five New Year's Day bowl berths. During the 1999 off- season, wide receiver Clifton Robinson was charged with statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl. Robinson was suspended from the team for five months. He ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and was sentenced to 200 hours of community service. After the plea deal, Tuberville suspended Robinson for the season opener before allowing him to rejoin the team. In 2004, Auburn went 13–0, including the SEC title and a win over Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl. Tuberville received Coach of the Year awards from the Associated Press, the American Football Coaches Association, the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association and the Walter Camp Football Foundation. In 2005, despite losing the entire starting backfield from the unbeaten 2004 team to the first round of the NFL draft, Tuberville led Auburn to a 9–3 record, finishing the regular season with victories over rivals Georgia and Alabama. Under Tuberville, Auburn had a winning record against its biggest rival, Alabama (7–3), and was tied with its next two most significant rivals, Georgia (5–5) and LSU (5–5). He led Auburn to six straight victories over in-state rival Alabama, the longest win streak in this rivalry since 1982, the year Auburn broke Alabama's nine-year winning streak. Tuberville before the 2007 Vanderbilt game, his 100th career win Tuberville also established himself as one of the best big- game coaches in college football, winning nine of his last 15 games against top-10 opponents since the start of the 2004 season. In 2006, his Tigers beat two top-5 teams who later played in BCS bowls, including eventual BCS Champion Florida. Tuberville had a 5-2 career record versus top-5 teams, including three wins versus Florida. But he developed a reputation for losing games when he clearly had the better team. Examples include a humbling 24-point loss to a 4–5 Alabama team in 2001 and a loss to Vanderbilt--the first time Auburn lost to the Commodores in over 50 years. In fact, after dropping three straight SEC games in 2003, Auburn booster Bobby Lowder and Auburn's president and athletic director contacted then Louisville head coach Bobby Petrino to gauge his interest in taking the Auburn job if Tuberville was fired. The press found out about the meeting, which occurred just before the 2003 Alabama game, and the episode has since been known as JetGate. Tuberville coached 19 players who were selected in the NFL draft, including four first-round picks in 2004, with several others signing as free agents. He coached eight All-Americans and a Thorpe Award winner (Carlos Rogers). Thirty-four players under Tuberville were named to All-SEC (First Team). Eighteen players were named All-SEC freshman. His players were named SEC player of the week 46 times. He also had two SEC players of the year and one SEC Championship game MVP. Tuberville fired offensive coordinator Tony Franklin on October 8, 2008. After the 2008 season, with a 5–7 record including losses to Vanderbilt, West Virginia, and a final 36–0 loss to Alabama, he was asked to resign from Auburn. Auburn athletic director Jay Jacobs claimed that Tuberville voluntarily resigned. Jacobs added: \\"To say the least, I was a little shocked. But after three times of asking him would he change his mind, he convinced me that the best thing for him and his family and for this football program was for him to possibly take a year off and take a step back.\\" With his departure, Tuberville was paid a pro-rated buyout of $5.1 million. The payments included $3 million within 30 days of his resignation date and the remainder within a year. Following his departure from Auburn, during the 2009 football season, Tuberville worked as an analyst for Buster Sports and ESPN, discussing the SEC and the Top 25 on various television shows and podcasts. He also made a cameo appearance in the Academy Award-winning feature film The Blind Side. Texas Tech Tuberville during the 2011 Texas Tech Red Raiders Spring Game On December 31, 2009, Tuberville expressed interest in becoming the head coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders football team. The position was left open after the university fired Mike Leach. On January 9, 2010, Tuberville was named head coach and was introduced at a press conference on Sunday, January 10, 2010. On January 1, 2011, Tuberville became the second head coach in Texas Tech football history to win a bowl game in his first season—an accomplishment unmatched since DeWitt Weaver's first season in 1951-52. This was a 45-38 victory over Northwestern in the inaugural TicketCity Bowl. On January 18, 2011, Texas Tech announced that Tuberville received a one-year contract extension and a $500,000 per year raise. The extension and raise gave Tuberville a $2 million per-year salary through the 2015 season. At the beginning of Tuberville's first year at Texas Tech, season ticket sales increased from the previous record of 30,092 to 46,546. Additionally, Tuberville is responsible for the highest-rated recruiting class in Texas Tech history, securing the 18th-ranked recruiting class in 2011 according to Rivals.com and the 14th-ranked class in the country according to Scout.com. On November 10, 2012, during a game against the Kansas Jayhawks, Tuberville became involved in a dispute with graduate assistant Kevin Oliver. Tuberville appeared to slap him and knocked off both Oliver's hat and his headset. After the game, Tuberville initially explained the incident by stating that he was aiming for Oliver's shirt in an attempt to pull him off the field. Two days later in his weekly press conference Tuberville apologized, citing his desire to set a better example for his two sons, one of whom was on the team. Although Tuberville continued to run Leach's wide-open \\"Air Raid\\" spread offense, he was never really embraced by a fan base still smarting over the popular Leach's ouster.Texas Tech hires Kliff Kingsbury. ESPN, December 12, 2012. According to a student on a recruiting trip to Texas Tech, Tuberville departed a recruiting dinner mid- meal and the next day accepted an offer to become Cincinnati's head coach. Tuberville left Texas Tech with an overall record of 20–17 and 9–17 in Big 12 conference play. Cincinnati On December 8, 2012, Tuberville resigned as head coach at Texas Tech in order to become the 38th head coach at the University of Cincinnati. He signed a $2.2 million contract to coach the team. Cincinnati's athletic director, Whit Babcock, had previously worked with Tuberville at Auburn; the two had been friends for several years.Tommy Tuberville new Cincy coach. ESPN, December 8, 2012. On December 9, an article in the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal pointed out that Cincinnati is only 30 miles from Guilford, Indiana, home of Tuberville's wife, Suzanne. In 2013, his first season with Cincinnati, Tuberville led the Bearcats to an overall record of 9–4 and a 6–2 conference record. His 2014 team was also 9–4 overall, but this time earned an American Athletic Conference co-championship by virtue of their 7–1 league mark. Both years also saw bowl losses, in 2013 to the North Carolina Tar Heels and 2014 to the Virginia Tech Hokies. On December 4, 2016, after a 4–8 season, he resigned as head coach of Cincinnati. Tuberville left Cincinnati with an overall record of 29–22 and 18–14 in AAC conference play. 2020 U.S. Senate campaign Tuberville in 2007 In August 2018, Tuberville moved from Florida to Alabama with the intent of running for the U.S. Senate in 2020. In April 2019, he announced he would enter the 2020 Republican primary for the Senate seat held by Democrat Doug Jones. Tuberville has run a campaign described as \\"low-profile,” with few pre-scheduled campaign appearances or press conferences. He has closely allied himself with President Donald Trump. Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer is a member of Tuberville's campaign staff. Tuberville opposes abortion, favors repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), and supports Trump's proposal to build a wall on the border with Mexico. He supports reducing the national debt through cuts to social programs, but opposes cuts to Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid. He dismisses the science of climate change, saying that the global climate \\"won't change enough in the next 400 years to affect anybody\\". On March 3, 2020, Tuberville finished first in the Republican primary with 33.4% of the vote, ahead of former United States senator and former attorney general Jeff Sessions, who received 31.6%. Because neither candidate got over 50% of the vote, this led to a runoff on July 14, which Tuberville won, defeating Sessions with 60.7% of the vote. He will face Jones in the general election on November 3, 2020, and is heavily favored to win the election. On March 10, Trump endorsed Tuberville. Many in the press attributed Trump's support of Tuberville to animosity that Trump had over Sessions's decision to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, when Sessions was U.S. Attorney General. In May 2020, Trump called Sessions \\"slime\\" for this decision. Tuberville attacked Sessions on this issue as well, stating in one campaign ad that Sessions \\"wasn't man enough to stand with President Trump when things got tough.\\" On July 28, 2020, Tuberville was endorsed by the National Right to Life Committee, America's largest anti-abortion organization. Personal life Tuberville married Vicki Lynn Harris, also from Camden, Arkansas (and a graduate of Harmony Grove High School), on December 19, 1976. During his time at Auburn, Tuberville participated actively in the Auburn Church of Christ and contributed time and resources to other Auburn organizations, including Storybook Farm, an equestrian-based program offering free therapeutic care to children with debilitating illnesses or suffering from bereavement. He also hosted charity golf tournaments for Camp ASCAA, the Girls and Boys Club of Montgomery, the Auburn University Marching Band, and the Alabama Sheriffs' Youth Ranches. Tuberville married Suzanne (née Fette) of Guilford, Indiana, in 1991. They have two sons. In 2012, Tuberville and his business partner were the subject of a $1.7 million federal lawsuit filed by investors alleging fraud. Attorneys for Tuberville denied the allegations, and he settled the lawsuit in 2013 for undisclosed terms. Tuberville's interests include \\"NASCAR, golf, football, hunting and fishing, . . . [and] America's military\\". He is a director of Morale Entertainment, which provides NCAA members for tours among deployed U.S. servicemembers.

It entered Jupiter on December 7, 1995, 22:04 UTC and stopped functioning at 23:01 UTC, 57 minutes and 36 seconds later.  Mission  The probe was released from the main spacecraft in July 1995, five months before reaching Jupiter, and entered Jupiter's atmosphere with no braking beforehand. The probe was slowed from its arrival speed of about 47 kilometers per second to subsonic speed in less than two minutes. The rapid flight through the atmosphere produced a plasma with a temperature around 15,500 °C (28,000 °F), and the probe's carbon phenolic heat shield lost more than half of its mass during the descent.http://www.spaceanswers.com/space-exploration/the-probe- that-survived-for-78-minutes-inside-jupiter/ At the time, this was by far the most difficult atmospheric entry ever attempted; the probe entered at Mach 50 and had to withstand a peak deceleration of 228 g. The probe's 152 kg heat shield, making up almost half of the probe's total mass, lost 80 kg during the entry. NASA built a special laboratory, the Giant Planet Facility, to simulate the heat load, which was similar to the convective and radiative heating experienced by an ICBM warhead reentering the atmosphere. It then deployed its parachute, and dropped its heat shield, which fell into Jupiter's interior. As the probe descended through of the top layers of the Jovian atmosphere, it collected 58 minutes of data on the local weather. It only stopped transmitting when the ambient pressure exceeded 23 atmospheres and the temperature reached . The data was sent to the spacecraft overhead, then transmitted back to Earth. Each of 2 L-band transmitters operated at 128 bytes per second and sent nearly identical streams of scientific data to the orbiter. All the probe's electronics were powered by lithium sulfur dioxide (LiSO2) batteries that provided a nominal power output of about 580 watts with an estimated capacity of about 21 ampere-hours on arrival at Jupiter.  Scientific instruments  The probe included seven instruments for taking data on its plunge into Jupiter:Galileo Probe NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive * an atmospheric structure instrument measuring temperature, pressure and deceleration, * a neutral mass spectrometer, * a Helium Abundance Detector, an interferometer supporting atmospheric composition studies, * a nephelometer for cloud location and cloud-particle observations, * a net-flux radiometer measuring the difference between upward and downward radiant flux at each altitude, and * a lightning and radio emission instrument measuring light and radio emissions associated with lightning * an energetic particle detector measuring energetic particles in Jupiter's radiation belts. In addition, the probe's heat shield contained instrumentation to measure ablation during descent. Total data returned from the probe was about 3.5 megabits (~460,000 bytes). The probe stopped transmitting before the line of sight link with the orbiter was cut. The likely proximal cause of the final probe failure was overheating, which sensors indicated before signal loss. The probe transmitted data down to 21 bars of pressure. (Earth sea-level is about 1 bar of pressure)  Results and end  The probe entered Jupiter's atmosphere at 22:04 UTC.Galileo Probe Entry Timeline NASA Before the atmospheric entry, the probe discovered a new radiation belt above Jupiter's cloud tops. The atmosphere through which it subsequently descended was found to be much denser and hotter than expected. Jupiter was also found to have only half the amount of helium expected and the data did not support the three-layered cloud structure theory. Only one significant cloud layer was measured by the probe, but with many indications of smaller areas of increased particle densities along all of the trajectory. The probe detected less lightning, less water, but more winds than expected. The atmosphere was more turbulent and the winds a lot stronger than the expected maximum of . It required a laborious analysis of the initial wind data from the probe to determine the actual measured wind speeds. The results eventually showed that wind speeds in the outermost layers were 290-360 kilometers per hour (80–100 m/s), in agreement with previous measurements from afar, but that winds increased dramatically at pressure levels of 1-4 bars, then remaining consistently high at around . No solid surface was detected during the downward journey. Subsequent analysis determined that the Galileo probe had entered a so-called hot spot in Jupiter's atmosphere. Radio contact ceased (due to the high temperature) 78 minutes after entering Jupiter's atmosphere at a depth of 160 kilometers. At that point the probe measured a pressure of 22 bars and a temperature of 152 °C.Galileo Probe Mission Events Theoretical analysis indicates that the parachute would have melted first, roughly 105 minutes after entry, then the aluminum components after another 40 minutes of free fall through a sea of supercritical fluid hydrogen. The titanium structure would have lasted around 6.5 hours more before disintegrating. Due to the high pressure, the droplets of metals from the probe would finally have vaporized once their critical temperature had been reached, and mixed with Jupiter's liquid metallic hydrogen interior. The probe was expected to have completely vaporized 10 hours after its atmospheric entry.

Image:Galileo Probe diagram.jpegDiagram of the atmospheric entry probe's instruments and subsystems Over time it was possible to mine the data for further insights into the atmosphere, and one way to do this was to study the motion of the probe during the descent down. It was found that at 700 mbar of pressure the winds on Jupiter are prograde and increase to a speed of 170 m/s at 4000 mbars of pressure.

Career Mayne was an All-American at Cal State Fullerton, and inducted into the Orange Coast College Hall of Fame in 2006. He was drafted in the first round of the 1989 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, 13th overall. Brent Mayne was a major league catcher from 1990 to 2004. He played most of his career with the Kansas City Royals but also spent time with the Mets, A's, Giants, Rockies, Diamondbacks, and Dodgers. He ranks 75th in the history of baseball with 1,143 pro games caught, and held the distinction of being the only catcher in the twentieth century to have won a game as a pitcher, until Cubs backup catcher John Baker won a game as a relief pitcher on July 29, 2014.http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/24642987/video- the-winning-pitcher-cubs-catcher-john-baker Through his career, the well traveled Mayne was an effective catcher and an excellent handler of pitchers. He blocked the plate well and had a strong arm. Mayne was a decent hitter with occasional power and compiled a career high .301 batting average in consecutive seasons (1999–2000). In retirement, Mayne has gone on to serve on the board of directors of the Braille Institute and the Center for Hope and Healing.

Competitive swimwear refers to the swimsuit, clothing, equipment, and accessories used in the aquatic sports of swimming, diving, synchronized swimming, triathlon, and water polo. Some swimsuits are designed specifically for swimming competitions where they may be constructed of a special low resistance fabric that reduces skin drag. For some kinds of swimming and diving, special bodysuits called \\"diveskins\\" are worn. These suits are made from spandex and provide little thermal protection, but they do protect the skin from stings and abrasion. Most competitive swimmers also wear special swimsuits including partial bodysuits, racerback styles, jammers and racing briefs to assist their glide through the water thus gaining a speed advantage. Unlike regular swimsuits, which are designed mainly for the aesthetic appearances, swimsuits designed to be worn during competitions are manufactured to assist the athlete in swim competitions. They reduce friction and drag in the water, increasing the efficiency of the swimmer's forward motion. The tight fits allow for easy movement and are said to reduce muscle vibration, thus reducing drag. This also reduces the possibility that a high forwards dive will remove a divers swimwear. Starting around 2000, in an effort to improve the effectiveness of the swimsuits, engineers have taken to designing them to replicate the skin of sea-based animals, sharks in particular. In July 2009, FINA voted to ban non-textile (non-woven) swimsuits in competitive events from 2010. The new policy was implemented to combat the issues associated with performance enhancing swimsuits, hindering the ability to accurately measure the performance of swimmers. Subsequently, the new ruling states that men's swimsuits may maximally cover the area from the navel to the knee, and women's counterparts from the shoulder to the knee.FINA bans hi-tech suits from 2010 BBC, 31 July 2009 Some swimmers use a specialized training suit called drag suits to artificially increase drag during practice. Drag suits are swimwear with an outer layer of looser fabric – often mesh or nylon – to increase resistance against the water and build up the swimmer's endurance. They come in a variety of styles, but most resemble a looser fitting square-cut or swim brief. History Five-time Olympic gold medalist Missy Franklin (of USA) in a common one-piece swimsuit The history of competitive swimwear has been dominated by concerns over public nudity in the first half of the 20th century and by efforts to reduce water drag in the second half.Swimwear history – from silk to sharks. BBC Those efforts initially lead male swimmers to reduce the early sagging one-piece swimsuits down to briefs only. With the development of new materials that tightly fit the body and offered lower resistance to water than human skin, this trend was reversed to a complete body coverage from heels to neck and wrists. In 1999, Australian competitive swimmer Ian Thorpe signed with Adidas for an undisclosed six-figure sum, to race in their new bodysuit, although the national team was sponsored and wore outfits designed by Speedo.Hunter, pp. 162–166. Thorpe's success in the 2000 Summer Olympics wearing the Adidas full- length black polyurethane bodysuit, in contrast to other swimmers wearing textile swimwear (males wore legskins, jammers, or briefs, while females wore racerback maillots), led to other swimming manufacturers such as Speedo and Mizuno to create their own rival bodysuits. Thorpe subsequently worked with Adidas which in 2003 released the adidas JETCONCEPT bodysuit, whose design \\"came from the V-shaped grooves currently used on the wings and fuselage of civil aircraft\\". The LZR Pro and LZR Elite lines were launched on 13 February 2008, with the LZR Elite being marketed as \\"the world's fastest swimsuit.\\"Engineering the world's fastest swimsuit . Physorg.com. 28 February 2008. It was the focus of Speedo's campaign for the 2008 Summer Olympics, spearheaded by Michael Phelps of the United States. They created a holographic (visually generated) video of Phelps wearing the suit which was displayed in London, Sydney, New York, and Tokyo on the day of the suit's release. Speedo's LZR Racer had become so effective by the eve of the 2008 Summer Olympics that many swimmers, despite them or their swimming federations having exclusive contracts with other apparel makers, have chosen the LZR Racer over competing bodysuits. At that year's Olympics in Beijing, 94% of all swimming races were won in that suit,Time's Best Innovations of 2008. Time.com (29 October 2008).

Suits made with polyurethane were banned because they made athletes more buoyant. These rules also banned suits which go above the navel or below the knee for men and suits which extend past the shoulders or cover the neck for women FINA stated that it \\"wishes to recall the main and core principle is that swimming is a sport essentially based on the physical performance of the athlete\\".Fina extends swimsuit regulations. BBC. 19 March 2009 Goggles were used in the crossing of the English Channel back in 1911, but only in 1970 appeared at international competitions. With the advent of rubber technology, latex swimming caps became mass-produced in the 1920s, and more efficient silicone caps appeared in the 1970s. Suits=Bodyskin Bodyskin swimsuit A bodyskin is a style of competitive swimwear worn by both female and male athletes. Bodyskins are normally made of technologically advanced lycra-based fabrics designed to hug the body tightly and provide increased speed and decreased drag resistance in the water. The bodyskin resembles the design of a dive skin, commonly used by snorkelers and scuba divers for warm weather climates. The primary distinguishing feature is the material from which the bodyskin suit is made. Some bodysuits provide full body coverage from the ankles to the neck and wrists, such as Ian Thorpe's adidas JETCONCEPT bodysuit which made its debut in 2003, Thorpe previously wore an earlier Adidas black bodysuit design in the 2000 Summer Olympics. Sleeveless designs such as the Speedo LZR Racer was popular in the 2008 Summer Olympics; Speedo also produces a bodyskin designed specifically for the backstroke. Other competing bodysuits include Acquablade, Fastskin, and Sharkskin, which are produced by Mizuno, Asics, Descente, Arena, and Nike. Swimmers reported that bodyskins improved buoyancy. This is true as long as the suits remain dry. As such, they are recommended for distances under 200m. The national coach of a small country stated that the suits need exact sizing and resulting high cost \\"increas[ed] the disparity between the haves and have nots.\\" As with most technologically advanced fabric swimwear, bodyskins were only commonly used at highly competitive levels of the swimming sport and are known to sell for prices in excess of US$400. Despite their cost, a single bodysuit can only be used for a handful of races, as getting in and out of the suit repeatedly would damage its form-fitting properties, memorably when Ian Thorpe tore his Adidas bodysuit right before the 4x100 men's freestyle relay podium ceremony in the 2000 Summer Olympics. FINA rule changes Bodyskins were banned from FINA competitions from the start of 2010 after many national swimming federations demanded the action, and leading athletes such as Michael Phelps and Rebecca Adlington criticised the suits. They continue to be used for other purposes, including research.  Briefs  A man wearing swim briefs A swim brief refers to any briefs style male swimsuit such as those worn in competitive swimming and diving. The popularity of the Australian Speedo (est. 1928) brand racing brief has led to the use of its name in some countries (e.g. the United States) to refer to any racing brief, regardless of the maker. Occasionally, the Speedo genericized trademark also applies to square cut swimsuits, but in general the generic term is used in reference to swim briefs. Swim briefs are also referred to as competition briefs, bathers, racer bathers, posing briefs, racing briefs, and colloquially in Australia as \\"budgie smugglers\\".Hoare, Daniel (24 November 2006) Vic Liberals play down election costings error. The World Today Like underwear briefs, swim briefs feature a V-shape front and a solid back providing form-fitting coverage. They typically are worn below the lower waist. They are generally secured by thin banding at the upper thighs and either a drawstring around the waist or an elastic waistband. Swim briefs are most often made of a nylon and spandex (Lycra) composite, while some longer lasting suits are made from polyester and still others from other materials. Most swim briefs have a beige or white front lining made of a similar fabric.  Drag suit  A drag suit is a pair of baggy squarecut or brief-style trunks that competitive swimmers may wear over their normal suit to provide extra resistance (\\"drag\\") from the water. This allows the swimmer to get more out of their training than they would without a drag suit. Drag suits are meant to be worn over a long period of time to wear in the material and possibly tear the fabric. The more worn-in, torn or ripped the drag suit, the more resistance it provides the swimmer. Since drag suits make swimming more difficult, swimmers do not wear drag suits in competition. Drag suits originated as older swimsuits at the end of their useful life that swimmers would then wear over another suit.  Kneeskin  A kneeskin is a type of competitive swimwear worn by both male and female athletes. Kneeskins are normally made of technologically advanced lycra-based fabrics designed to hug the body tightly and provide increased speed and decreased drag resistance in the water. The kneeskin is similar in design to the full bodyskin absent the leggings beyond the knee. It also resembles a \\"shortie\\" style wetsuit only made of drag-reducing fabric instead of neoprene and commonly features a zippered back. Most competitive swimwear brands such as the Speedo LZR Racer line, Tyr Sport, Inc. and Arena Powerskin line produce suits of this type. As with most technologically advanced fabric swimwear, kneeskin suits are only commonly used at highly competitive levels of the swimming sport and are known to sell for prices in excess of US$200.Competition Swimwear Retrieved 11 February 2012.  Jammer  Swim Jammer A jammer is a style of swimsuit worn by male swimmers, used mainly in competition to obtain speed advantages. They are generally made of nylon and lycra/spandex material, but may be made of polyester, and have a form fitting design to reduce water resistance. The materials usually dry fairly quickly. They provide moderate coverage from the mid-waist to the area above the knee, somewhat resembling cycling shorts or compression shorts worn by many athletes. They provide greater leg coverage than swim briefs and square leg suits, although they also have slightly more water resistance.  Legskin  A legskin is a type of competitive swimwear worn by male swimmers. Most legskins are made of technologically advanced lycra-based fabrics designed to hug the body tightly and provide increased speed and decreased drag resistance in the water. The legskin covers from the swimmer's mid-waist to his ankle and resembles leggings. One advantage of the legskin over other suit styles that cover the arms is flexibility, especially for strokes that require broad arm movement. Since 2009, legskins have been banned for competition swimming by FINA since they gave an unfair advantage to swimmers who wore them; the ban includes bodysuits.  Racerback  A female swimmer in racerback one-piece swimsuit along with a male swimmer in briefs, at a mixed synchronised swimming event. A racerback is a type of women's swimsuit design common today among competitive swimwear and incorporated into some types of women's clothing. The top-back of the swimsuit is not covered to provide flexibility and movement of the arms during swimming.  Square cut  Square cut swimsuit. The square cut or square leg style suit is a form- fitting male swimsuit used as a slightly less revealing style than swim briefs for water polo and diving, or for recreational wear. Like swim briefs, they are made of a nylon and spandex blend. They typically sit low on the waist and high on the thigh, but provide more coverage for the upper leg than briefs. The square-cut style was popular as a recreational swimsuit for men during the 1950s. Suits of this type are named for the coverage that they provide to the upper thighs due to a square seam opening for the leg. Square leg suits range in appearance from those similar to swim briefs with a slightly straighter front and wider side panelling (eliminating the arc appearance on the leg), to those resembling boxer briefs by providing an inch or more of fabric coverage over the upper section of the leg. The square leg suit of the 1970s made a fashion revival in Australia in 2002 with the introduction of colorful floral and retro geometric patterned suits by swimwear label Funky Trunks. The style is popular amongst competitive swimmers for pool training and for recreational swimmers in the pool and at the beach.

Its source is in the county of Hampshire, and part of its course forms the border between Berkshire and Hampshire. Despite the name, the river does not run through the village of Enborne, although it does run through Enborne Row. Geography From its source near the villages of Inkpen and Woodhay, the Enborne flows Eastwards towards Newbury. At Smith's Bridge, near Holtwood the river is also now the boundary between Berkshire and Hampshire. Continuing East the river is crossed by the A34 (Newbury bypass) at Enborne Row to the South of Newbury. Near here to the South is \\"The Chase\\" and \\"Great Pen Wood,\\" woodland managed by the National Trust. It flows due east touching part of Wash Common and then along the boundary of Sandleford and Highclere, reaching Newtown, Hampshire. At Sandleford and Newtown, near the Newbury to Whitchurch road, there was a mill, and here too, circa 1780, Capability Brown gave Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu, of Sandleford, plans to ornament the river. Forty years earlier in 1743 Mrs Montagu described the river, then also known as the Alder stream, to her friend the Duchess of Portland: 'A silver stream washes the foot of the village [Newtown]; health, pleasure, and refreshment are the ingredients that qualify this spring; no debauch, or intoxication, arises from its source'. The Letters of Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu, edited by her nephew Matthew Montagu, MP, London, 1809. It then passes to the South of Greenham Common, and here, near Headley, the river is joined by a tributary from the South, from Ecchinswell and Watership Down Hill. The river continues meandering its way across open farmland towards Brimpton Common. At Inwood Copse a change in the landscape sends the river to the northeast, and it no longer forms the border between Hampshire and Berkshire. It joins the River Kennet between the villages of Aldermaston and Aldermaston Wharf. The river in fiction The river plays a significant part in Richard Adams' novel, Watership Down. Early in the book, the rabbits from Sandleford are threatened by a dog. Blackberry realises that they can float across on a wooden board, and thus they make their escape.

It tells the story of an egotistical man who experiences luck and misfortunes in the height of 18th-century European society. Plot summary Commodore Trunnion and Jack Hatchway by Francis William Edmonds The novel begins with the character of Peregrine as a young country gentleman rejected by his cruel mother, ignored by his indifferent father, and hated by his degenerate brother. After their alienation, he turns to Commodore Hawser Trunnion, who raises him. Peregrine's detailed life experience provides a scope for Smollett's satire on human cruelty, stupidity, and greed: from his upbringing, education at Oxford, journey to France, jailing at the Fleet, unexpected succession to his father's fortune, and final repentance and marriage to his beloved Emilia. The novel is written as a series of adventures, with every chapter depicting a new experience. The novel also contains a lengthy independent story called \\"The Memoirs of a Lady of Quality\\", written by Frances Vane, Viscountess Vane. Peregrine Pickle features several amusing characters, most notably Commodore Hawser Trunnion, an old seaman and misogynist who lives in a house with his former shipmates.

Paper 1304. http://scholarworks.umass.edu/theses/1304 Another interesting character is Peregrine's friend Cadwallader Crabtree, an old misanthrope who amuses himself by playing ingenious jokes on naive people. Smollett also caricatured many of his enemies in the novel, most notably Henry Fielding and the actor David Garrick. Fitzroy Henry Lee was supposedly the model for Hawser Trunnion.J. K. Laughton, ‘Lee, Fitzroy Henry (1699–1750)’, rev. Philip Carter, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Criticism George Orwell, writing in the Tribune in 1944, said regarding the novels Roderick Random and Peregrine Pickle: :\\"Peregrine devotes himself for months at a time to the elaborate and horribly cruel practical jokes in which the eighteenth century delighted. When, for instance, an unfortunate English painter is thrown into the Bastille for some trifling offence and is about to be released, Peregrine and his friends, playing on his ignorance of the language, let him think he has been sentenced to be broken on a wheel. A little later they tell him that his punishment has been commuted to castration. Why are these petty rogueries worth reading about? In the first place because they are funny. Secondly, by simply ruling out \\"good\\" motives and showing no respect whatever for human dignity, Smollett often attains a truthfulness that more serious novelists have missed.\\"Tribune, 22 September 1944, reprinted in Orwell: Collected Works, I Have Tried to Tell the Truth, p. 409 Legacy George P. Upton published the Letters of Peregrine Pickle in the Chicago Tribune from 1866–1869 as weekly letters and then in book forms.

It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 4, 1997. In the episode, Frank Grimes is hired as a new employee at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Despite Homer's attempts to befriend him, Grimes is angered by Homer's laziness and incompetence. He declares himself Homer's enemy and tries to expose his flaws through public humiliation. In the subplot, Bart buys a run- down factory for a dollar. \\"Homer's Enemy\\" was directed by Jim Reardon and written by John Swartzwelder, based on an idea pitched by executive producer Bill Oakley. The episode explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic hired for a job where he has to work alongside a man like Homer. He was partially modeled after Michael Douglas's character in the film Falling Down. Hank Azaria voiced Frank Grimes and based some of the character's mannerisms on actor William H. Macy. Frank Welker guest stars as the voice of the dog whom Burns wants as his executive vice president. In its original broadcast on the Fox network, \\"Homer's Enemy\\" acquired a 7.7 Nielsen rating. It was viewed in approximately 7.5 million homes, finishing the week ranked 56th. \\"Homer's Enemy\\" is considered to be one of the darkest episodes of The Simpsons, and it split critical opinion. It is a favorite of several members of the production staff, including Bill Oakley, Josh Weinstein and Matt Groening, but it is one of the least favorites of Mike Reiss. Plot After spending most of his life alone and working hard to make ends meet, Frank Grimes is hired at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He is assigned to Sector 7G, where he must work alongside Homer Simpson and his two friends, Lenny and Carl. Grimes quickly becomes aghast at Homer's laziness and incompetence. When Grimes prevents Homer from accidentally drinking a flask of sulfuric acid by knocking it from his hands. Mr. Burns admonishes Grimes and reduces his pay, as the spilled acid destroyed a wall. Outraged, Grimes declares that he and Homer are now enemies. At Moe Syzlak's suggestion, Homer invites Grimes to his home for a lobster dinner, hoping to make amends. However, Grimes only grows more incensed by Homer's ability to live such a comfortable life despite his sloth and ignorance, while Grimes has worked hard his whole life and has little to show for it. Denouncing Homer as a fraud, Grimes leaves in anger. The next day, Homer tries to earn Grimes's respect by being a model employee, but his efforts fail. Grimes rants about Homer to Lenny and Carl, who insist that Homer is a decent person despite his many faults. To prove Homer's lack of intelligence, Grimes tricks him into entering a contest (intended for children) to design a nuclear power plant. Grimes's plan backfires when Homer's model wins the contest. After Homer's co-workers applaud instead of ridiculing him, Grimes snaps and runs amok at the plant, mocking Homer's stupid habits. When he grabs ahold of high-voltage wires without safety gloves, Grimes is electrocuted to death. At Grimes's funeral, Homer falls asleep and talks in his dream, making Reverend Lovejoy and the attendees laugh as Grimes's coffin is lowered into the earth. In the subplot, Bart buys an abandoned factory for a dollar at a foreclosure auction. He and Milhouse spend their days wrecking the building until it collapses one night during Milhouse's watch, causing the rats in the building to swarm into Moe's Tavern. Production \\"Homer's Enemy\\" was written by John Swartzwelder, directed by Jim Reardon and executive produced by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein. One of the goals of Oakley and Weinstein was to create several episodes in each season that would \\"push the envelope conceptually.\\" The idea for the episode was first conceived by Bill Oakley, who thought that Homer should have an enemy. The thought evolved into the concept of a \\"real world\\" co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the latter as they thought it would have funnier results. The result was the character of Grimes, a man who had to work hard all his life with nothing to show for it and is dismayed and embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance. \\"Homer's Enemy\\" explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In an essay for the book Leaving Springfield, Robert Sloane describes the episode as \\"an incisive consideration of The Simpsons's world. Although The Simpsons is known for its self- reflectivity, the show had never looked at (or critiqued) itself as directly as it does in ['Homer's Enemy'].\\" In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; however, in some scenes his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the close of the episode, Grimes, a hard-working and persevering \\"real American hero,\\" is relegated to the role of antagonist; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious. In an interview with Simpsons fan site NoHomers.net, Josh Weinstein said: The animators and character designers had a lot of discussion about what Frank Grimes should look like. He was originally designed as a \\"burly ex-marine guy with a crew cut\\", but would later be modeled after Michael Douglas in the movie Falling Down and director Jim Reardon's college roommate. Hank Azaria provided the voice of Frank Grimes, even though such a role would normally have been performed by a guest star. Among few others, the producers considered asking Nicholas Cage to play Grimes but decided Azaria was more suitable because the role involved a great deal of frustration and required extensive knowledge of the show. Azaria felt that the role should instead go to William H. Macy. According to Azaria, \\"I based the character on William Macy. I can't really copy him vocally, but I tried to get as close as I could and copy his rhythms and the way he has that sort of seething passion underneath that total calm exterior.\\" The producers worked a lot with Azaria to help him perfect the role, and gave him more guidance than they normally would. Azaria felt that it was the role he worked hardest on, adding \\"I think it's the one we did the most takes on, the most emotional, it felt like the one I worked on the hardest from a performance point of view, in preparation and in execution.\\" Josh Weinstein has expressed regret about killing off Grimes after only one episode, describing him as \\"such an amazing character.\\" In an interview with The Believer, producer George Meyer said, \\"Grimes's cardinal sin was that he shined a light on Springfield. He pointed out everything that was wrongheaded and idiotic about that world. And the people who do that tend to become martyrs. He said things that needed to be said, but once they were said, we needed to destroy that person. I'll admit, we took a certain sadistic glee in his downfall. He was such a righteous person, and that somehow made his demise more satisfying.\\" The subplot, where Bart buys a factory, was added so that there would be some lighter scenes to split up the main plot. According to Weinstein, \\"We wanted to have a Bart or Lisa kids' story to contrast the heaviness and reality of Frank Grimes.\\" Reception In its original broadcast on the Fox network, \\"Homer's Enemy\\" acquired a 7.7 Nielsen rating. It was viewed in approximately 7.5 million homes, finishing the week ranked 56th. The Simpsons was the sixth highest rated show on Fox the week it was broadcast, behind The X-Files, a broadcast of the film The Mask, Melrose Place, King of the Hill and Beverly Hills, 90210. According to Josh Weinstein, when the episode was first broadcast, many fans felt it was too dark, lacked humor and that Homer was portrayed as overly bad-mannered. Weinstein considers this episode one of the most controversial of the seasons he ran, as it involves sharp observational humor which he thinks many fans \\"didn't get.\\" Weinstein also talks about a \\"generation gap\\"—he believes the episode was originally panned by viewers, but has since become a favorite among fans who grew up with the show. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, authors of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, described the episode as \\"one of the series' darkest episodes [that] ends on a real downer but is nevertheless also one of the wittiest and cleverest in ages.\\" Similarly, comedian Rick Mercer called it a \\"great episode, and one of the darkest ever produced.\\" Many critics have listed \\"Homer's Enemy\\" as one of the best episodes of the series, including John Orvted of Vanity Fair, Entertainment.ie, Screen Rant, The Guardian,, and Time. IGN.com ranked Frank Grimes as number 17 on a list of \\"The Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral characters\\", making him the least-frequently shown character to appear in that list. Several members of the staff have included the episode among their favorites. In a 2000 Entertainment Weekly article, Matt Groening ranked it as his sixth favorite Simpsons episode. It is a favorite of Josh Weinstein, who cites the scene when Grimes visits the Simpson home as one of his favorite scenes, while The Office creator Ricky Gervais has called it \\"the most complete episode.\\" In her autobiography My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy, Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart, praises Azaria's performance as Grimes, and uses it as an example of how \\"Accent, pitch, pacing, range and intention\\" can allow an actor to voice many characters. She writes, However, former Simpsons executive producer Mike Reiss listed \\"Homer's Enemy\\" as one of his two least favorite episodes, stating, \\"I just think the episode was in bad taste.\\" Likewise, Jon Bonné of MSNBC used \\"Homer's Enemy\\" as an example of a bad episode of the eighth season and wrote \\"even now [in 2000], when subsequent episodes have debased Homer in new and innovative ways, the Grimes episode stands out as painful to watch.\\" In August 2014, writing for The Verge, Chris Plante listed \\"Homer's Enemy\\" as one of his favorite episodes of The Simpsons, and Homer falling asleep and talking in his dream at Grimes' funeral as one of the funniest moments in the show, but he cited the latter as the moment the series jumped the shark, because of the impact it \\"has on the show's character [Homer], and through that character, the world.\\" Legacy Frank Grimes has since been referenced many times in the show, often showing his tombstone, and occasionally mentioning him by name. In the season fourteen episode \\"The Great Louse Detective\\", it is revealed that he fathered a son named Frank Grimes Jr., who tries and fails to kill Homer. The footage of Grimes' death is also shown during that episode. In the non-canon season twenty-eight episode \\"Treehouse of Horror XXVII\\", the ghost of Frank Grimes joined Sideshow Bob's army of the Simpsons' enemies. During the nuclear power plant design contest, one of the entrants is Ralph Wiggum, whose entry is rejected by Mr. Burns. When Ralph does not leave the stage, Chief Wiggum says \\"Ralphie, get off the stage, sweetheart.\\" This line was later used as the chorus in the song \\"Ralph Wiggum\\" by the Bloodhound Gang. In February 2000, the cast of The Simpsons performed a live reading of the episode script at the US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado.

The term is used to include the Karo, Pakpak, Simalungun, Toba, Angkola, and Mandailing which are related groups with distinct languages and traditional customs (adat).  Prehistory  A traditional Toba Batak house (see Batak architecture). Linguistic and archaeological evidence indicates that Austronesian speakers first reached Sumatra from Taiwan and the Philippines through Borneo or Java about 2,500 years ago, and the Batak probably descended from these settlers. While the archaeology of southern Sumatra testifies to the existence of neolithic settlers, it seems that the northern part of Sumatra was settled by agriculturalists at a considerably later stage. Although the Batak are often considered to be isolated peoples thanks to their location inland, away from the influence of seafaring European colonials, there is evidence that they have been involved in trade with other neighbouring kingdoms for a millennium or more. The Bataks practiced a syncretic religion of Shaivism, Buddhism and local culture for thousands of years. The last Batak king who fought valiantly against Dutch imperialists until 1905 was an Indonesian Shaivite king. The Batak may be mentioned in Zhao Rugua's 13th-century Description of the Barbarous Peoples (Zhu Fan Zhi ), which refers to a 'Ba-ta' dependency of Srivijaya. The Suma Oriental, of the 15th century, also refers to the kingdom of Bata, bounded by Pasai and the Aru kingdom. Based on this evidence, the Batak may have been involved in procuring important commodities for trade with China, perhaps from the 8th or 9th centuries and continuing for the next thousand years, with Batak men carrying the products on their backs for sale at ports. It has been suggested that the important port of Barus in Tapanuli was populated by Batak people. A Tamil inscription has been found in Barus which is dated to 1088, while contact with Chinese and Tamil traders took place at Kota Cina, a trading town located in what is now northern Medan that was established in the 11th century, and comprising 10,000 people by the 12th century. Tamil remains have been found on key trade routes to the Batak lands. These trading opportunities may have caused migration of Batak from Pakpak and Toba to the present-day Karo and Simalungun 'frontier' lands, where they were exposed to greater influence from visiting Tamil traders, while the migration of Batak to the Angkola-Mandailing lands may have been prompted by 8th-century Srivijayan demand for camphor. The Karo marga or tribe Sembiring \\"black one\\" is believed to originate from their ties with Tamil traders, with specific Sembiring sub-marga, namely Brahmana, Colia, Pandia, Depari, Meliala, Muham, Pelawi, and Tekan all of Indian origin. Tamil influence on Karo religious practices are also noted, with the pekualuh secondary cremation ritual being specific to the Karo and Dairi people. Moreover the Pustaka Kembaren, an origin story of the Sembiring Kembaren suggests linkages with Pagarruyung in Minangkabau Highlands. From the 16th century onward, Aceh increased the production of pepper, an important export commodity, in exchange for rice, which grew well in the Batak wetlands. Batak people in different areas cultivated either sawah (wet rice fields) or ladang (dry rice), and the Toba Batak, most expert in agriculture, must have migrated to meet demand in new areas. The increasing importance of rice had religious significance, which increased the power of the Batak high priests, who had responsibility for ensuring agricultural success. Language Bark book with charms written in native Batak script, 1910. The Batak speak a variety of closely related languages, all members of the Austronesian language family. There are two major branches, a northern branch comprising the Pakpak-Dairi, Alas-Kluet and Karo languages, which are similar to each other, and a distinct southern branch, comprising three mutually intelligible dialects: Toba, Angkola and Mandailing. Simalungun is an early offspring of the southern branch. Some Simalungun dialects can be understood by speakers of Batak Karo, whereas other dialects of Simalungun can be understood by speakers of Toba. This is due to the existence of a linguistic continuum that often blurs the lines between the Batak dialects. Batak dialect still influences the dialects in Medan city today. The Batak possess their own script known as the Surat Batak.Kozok, Uli, \\"Bark, Bones and Bamboo: Batak traditions of Sumatra,\\" in Illuminations: The Writing Traditions of Indonesia, Ann Kumar and John McGlynn, eds., Lontar and Weatherhill, Jakarta (1237). The writing has chiefly ceremonial importance within traditional religious ceremonies, and was subject to little change for this reason. It is likely that the Batak people originally received their writing system from southern Sumatra. Profession Traditional boat (circa 1870), photograph by Kristen Feilberg. The traditional occupation of the Batak was agriculture, hunting and farming. The great lake of Toba provided vast opportunity for freshwater aquaculture since ancient times. Interior rural Batak communities relied heavily on rice farming, horticulture and other plant and commercial crops, and to some extent, acquiring forest products, such as hard wood, plant resin, and wild animals. The port of Barus on the western coast of Batak lands has become famous as the source of kapur barus (camphor). In ancient times, Batak warriors were often recruited by neighboring Malay courts as mercenaries. In the colonial era, the Dutch introduced commercial cash crops, such as coffee, sawit palm oil, and rubber, converting some parts of the Batak land into plantations. Throughout the history of modern Indonesia, the Batak community has been a significant contributor. Batak people have filled a wide range of occupations, from running modest tire service workshops to serving as state ministers. The modern Batak have gravitated towards professions such as attorneys, bus and taxi drivers, mechanics, engineers, singers and musicians, writers and journalists, teachers, economists, scientists, and military officers. Even though the Batak are a minority among the Indonesian population (3.58%; only 8-9 million Batak people out of 236 million according 2010's census), there have been a number of notable Batak that have risen to distinguished positions and careers. Especially in the field of law the Batak have been well-represented. One of the most influential attorneys in Indonesian legal history was Adnan Buyung Nasution who struggled in the autocratic Suharto era with great personal risk and engagement for democratic values and the rule of law. Among others, lawyers like Todung Mulya Lubis, Ruhut Sitompul and Hotman Paris Hutapea are widely known beyond the circle of their legal colleagues, since they have gained star lawyer reputations by handling high-profile cases closely reported by the media. Besides that, Batak people have also shaped Indonesian society in the sense of cultural development. Merari Siregar (1896-1941) is the author of Azab dan Sengsara (Pain and Suffering, 1920), the first modern novel written in Indonesian. National heroes such as Sisingamangaraja XII, two Indonesian prime ministers (Amir Syarifuddin Harahap and Burhanuddin Harahap), speakers of the parliament (Zainul Arifin Pohan), one vice president (Adam Malik Batubara), governor of the central bank (Darmin Nasution), one attorney general (Marsillam Simanjuntak), and many cabinet ministers (such as M.S. Kaban, Tifatul Sembiring, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan), as well as leading military generals and officers (Abdul Harris Nasution, T. B. Simatupang, Maraden Panggabean) are also showing their influence in Indonesian history and politics. Society A Batak couple, circa 1914–1919. Batak societies are patriarchally organized along clans known as Marga. A traditional belief among the Toba Batak is that they originate from one ancestor \\"Si Raja Batak\\", with all Margas descended from him. A family tree that defines the father-son relationship among Batak people is called tarombo. In contemporary Indonesia, the Batak people have a strong focus on education and a prominent position in the professions, particularly as teachers, engineers, doctors and lawyers. Toba Batak are known traditionally for their weaving, wood carving and especially ornate stone tombs. Before they became subjects of the colonial Dutch East Indies government, the Batak had a reputation for being fierce warriors. Today the Batak are mostly Christian with a Muslim minority. Currently the largest Christian congregation in Indonesia is the HKBP (Huria Kristen Batak Protestan) Christian church. The dominant Christian theology was brought by Lutheran German missionaries in the 19th century, including the well-known missionary Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen. Christianity was introduced to the Karo by Dutch Calvinist missionaries, and their largest church is the GBKP (Gereja Batak Karo Protestan). The Mandailing and Angkola Batak were converted to Islam in the early 19th century during the reign of Minangkabaus Padri.Luckman Sinar (Tengku), The History of Medan in the Olden Times, 1996 A significant minority of Batak people do not adhere to either Christianity or Islam, however, and follow traditional practices known as the agama si dekah, the old religion, which is also called perbegu or pemena.Sibeth, p. 86.  Dalihan Na Tolu  Dalihan Na Tolu (three-legged furnace) is the philosophy of life of the Batak people. It was consisted of three general rule in Batak society. Those are: # Somba Marhulahula (showing respect to wife's family). Even though somba could mean worship, in Dalihan Na Tolu, it means respect to those with wife family and those with the same clan (Marga (Batak)). Those family includes wife of the grandfathers, wife of the fathers, and wife of the children. # Elek Marboru (showing kindness to all women). Kindness in this context means not accompanied by ulterior motives and self-interest. Also, women in this context means the family who marry the daughter, including the daughter itself. # Manat Mardongan Tubu (careful in living with close relatives). Living carefully means a cautious attitude towards fellow Marga to prevent misunderstandings in the implementation of custom tradition events. This act was reflected in the Batak proverb \\"hau na jonok do na boi marsiogoson\\" (only woods that are really close can cause friction). This illustrates that it is in close and frequent intercourse that possible conflicts of interest, status, etc. can occur The essence of this teachings is the moral code contains the teachings of mutual respect (masipasangapon) with the support of the moral rule: mutual respect and helpfulness. Ritual cannibalism Pottery making by Batak women in Tarutung, Batak-country; Dutch East Indies era. Ritual cannibalism was well documented among pre-colonial Batak people, being performed in order to strengthen the eater's tendi. In particular, the blood, heart, palms and soles of the feet were seen as rich in tendi. In Marco Polo’s memoirs of his stay on the east coast of Sumatra (then called Java Minor) from April to September 1292, he mentions an encounter with hill folk whom he refers to as “man-eaters”.Polo M, Yule H, Cordier H. The Travels of Marco Polo: The Complete Yule-Cordier Edition, Dover Pubns, 1993, Vol. II, Chapter X, p. 366. From secondary sources, Marco Polo recorded stories of ritual cannibalism among the \\"Battas\\". Marco Polo's stay was restricted to the coastal areas, and he never ventured inland to directly verify such claims. Despite never personally witnessing these events, he was nonetheless willing to pass on descriptions which were provided to him, in which a condemned man was eaten: \\"They suffocate him. And when he is dead they have him cooked, and gather together all the dead man's kin, and eat him. And I assure you they do suck the very bones till not a particle of marrow remains in them...And so they eat him up stump and rump. And when they have thus eaten him they collect his bones and put them in fine chests, and carry them away, and place them in caverns among the mountains where no beast nor other creature can get at them. And you must know also that if they take prisoner a man of another country, and he cannot pay a ransom in coin, they kill him and eat him straightway.Polo, Vol. II, Chapter X, p. 369. The Venetian Niccolò de' Conti (1395–1469) spent most of 1421 in Sumatra in the course of a long trading journey to Southeast Asia (1414–1439), and wrote a brief description of the inhabitants: \\"In a part of the island called Batech live cannibals who wage continual war on their neighbors.\\"The Travels of Nicolò Conte [sic] in the East in the Early Part of the Fifteenth Century Hakluyt Society xxii (London, 1857)Sibeth A, Kozok U, Ginting JR. The Batak: Peoples of the Island of Sumatra: Living with Ancestors. New York: Thames and Hudson, (1991) p. 16. Judgement Place of Toba Batak. Batak warriors, 1870. Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles in the 1820s studied the Batak and their rituals and laws regarding the consumption of human flesh, writing in detail about the transgressions that warranted such an act as well as their methods.Nigel Barley (ed.), The Golden Sword: Stamford Raffles and the East, British Museum Press, 1999 (exhibition catalogue). Raffles stated that \\"It is usual for the people to eat their parents when too old to work,\\" and that for certain crimes a criminal would be eaten alive: “The flesh is eaten raw or grilled, with lime, salt and a little rice.”Barley N. The Duke of Puddle Dock: Travels in the Footsteps of Stamford Raffles. 1st American ed. New York: H. Holt, 1992, p. 112. The German physician and geographer Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn visited the Batak lands in 1840-41. Junghuhn says about cannibalism among the Batak (whom he called \\"Battaer\\"): “People do the honest Battaer an injustice when it is said that they sell human flesh in the markets, and that they slaughter their old people as soon as they are unfit for work...They eat human flesh only in wartime, when they are enraged, and in a few legal instances.” Junghuhn tells how after a perilous and hungry flight he arrived in a friendly village, and the food that was offered by his hosts was the flesh of two prisoners who had been slaughtered the day before,Junghuhn, F., Die Batta-länder auf Sumatra, (1847) Vol. II, p. 249. however he maintains that the Batak exaggerated their love of human flesh in order to frighten off would-be invaders and to gain occasional employment as mercenaries for the coastal tribes who were plagued by pirates. Oscar von Kessel visited Silindung in the 1840s and in 1844 was probably the first European to observe a Batak cannibalistic ritual in which a convicted adulterer was eaten alive. His description parallels that of Marsden in some important respects, however von Kessel states that cannibalism was regarded by the Batak as a judicial act and its application was restricted to very narrowly defined infringements of the law including theft, adultery, spying or treason. Salt, red pepper and lemons had to be provided by the relatives of the victim as a sign that they accepted the verdict of the community and were not thinking of revenge.Von Kessel, O., \\"Erinnerungen an Sumatra,\\" Das Ausland, Stuttgart (1854) 27:905-08. Ida Laura Pfeiffer visited the Batak in August 1852 and although she did not observe any cannibalism, she was told that: :\\"Prisoners of war are tied to a tree and beheaded at once; but the blood is carefully preserved for drinking, and sometimes made into a kind of pudding with boiled rice. The body is then distributed; the ears, the nose, and the soles of the feet are the exclusive property of the Rajah, who has besides a claim on other portions. The palms of the hands, the soles of the feet, the flesh of the head, and the heart and liver, are reckoned peculiar delicacies, and the flesh in general is roasted and eaten with salt. The Regents assured me, with a certain air of relish, that it was very good food, and that they had not the least objection to eat it. The women are not allowed to take part in these grand public dinners.\\"Pfeiffer, Ida, A Lady's Second Journey Around the World: From London to the Cape of Good Hope, Borneo, Java, Sumatra, Celebes, Ceram, the Moluccas, etc., California, Panama, Peru, Ecuador, and the United States. New York, Harper & Brothers, 1856, p. 151 Samuel Munson and Henry Lyman, American Baptist missionaries to the Batak, were cannibalized in 1834. Dutch and German missionaries to the Batak in the late 19th century observed a few instances of cannibalism and wrote lurid descriptions to their home parishes in order to raise donations for further missions.An example may be found in Wegner, R., Einzelzüge aus der Arbeit der Rheinischen Mission, Gütersloh (1900) The growing Dutch influence in northern Sumatra led to increased Malay influence in coastal trade and plantations, pushing the Karo farther inland. Growing ethnic tensions culminated in the 1872 Karo Rebellion where the Karo were suppressed by Dutch and Malay forces. Despite this, Karo resistance to Dutch imperialism lingered into the early 20th century.Niessen, Sandra. \\"Foreign Penetration of North Sumatra.\\" Indonesian Heritage: Early Modern History. Vol. 3, ed. Anthony Reid, Sian Jay, T. Durairajoo. Singapore: Editions Didiers Millet, 2001. pp. 134-35. In 1890 the Dutch colonial government banned cannibalism in the regions under their control.Sibeth, p. 19. Rumors of Batak cannibalism survived into the early 20th century but it seems probable that the custom was rare after 1816, due partially to the influence of Islam.Kipp RS. The early years of a Dutch Colonial Mission: the Karo Field. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1990. Tarombo Family tree or lineage is a very important thing for the Batak. For those who do not know the lineage will be considered as a strayed (nalilu) Batak. Batak people are required to know their lineage or at least the ancestors of which the family name (Marga (Batak)) and the related clans (dongan tubu) came from. This is necessary in order to determine the relation of a kinship (partuturanna) within a clan or simply the surname (Marga (Batak)) itself. Geography The Batak lands consist of North Sumatra province, excluding Nias island, the historically Malay kingdoms of the east coast and the western coast of Minangkabau people.Daniel Perret, Kolonialisme dan Etnisitas: Batak dan Melayu di Sumatra Timur Laut, Gramedia, 2010 In addition, part of the Karo lands extend into modern-day East Aceh Regency in Aceh province, while parts of the Mandailing lands lie in Rokan Hulu Regency in Riau. Significant numbers of Batak have migrated in recent years to prosperous neighbouring Riau province. To the south of North Sumatra are the Muslim Minangkabau of West Sumatra, while to the north there are various Muslim Acehnese peoples. Traditional Batak religion Batak village on Samosir island. The various Batak cultures differ in their pre-colonial religious ideas as they do in many other aspects of culture. Information about the old religious ideas of the Mandailing and Angkola in southern Batakland is incomplete, and very little is known about the religion of the Pakpak and Simalungun Batak. For the Toba and Karo on the other hand the evidence in the writings of missionaries and colonial administrators is relatively abundant. Information on the traditional forms of Batak religion is derived mainly from the writings of German and Dutch missionaries who became increasingly concerned with Batak beliefs towards the end of the 19th century.Sibeth, p. 64. Various influences affected the Batak through their contact with Tamil and Javanese traders and settlers in southern Batakland, and the east and west coast near Barus and Tapanuli, in particular the large Padang Lawas temple complex in Tapanuli. These contacts took place many centuries ago and it is impossible to reconstruct just how far the religious ideas of these foreigners were adopted and reworked by the Batak. It is suggested that the Batak adopted aspects of these religions, specifically Mahayana Buddhist, Shaivist, and Tantrist practices within their own customs.H. Parkin, The Extent and Areas of Indian/Hindu Influence on the Ideas and Development of Toba-Batak Religion and Its Implications for the Christianization of the Toba-Batak People of North Sumatra. D.Th. Dissertation, Serampore, 1975, p. 440; Also published under the title Batak Fruit of Hindu Thought, (Christian Literature Society 1978,1987). The modern Indonesian state is founded on the principles of pancasila, which requires the belief in 'one and only God', the practice of either Protestantism, Catholicism, Islam, Buddhism or Hinduism, one of which must be entered on an individual's KTP. Traditional religions are not officially recognised, and accordingly traditional religions are increasingly marginalised, although aspects of the traditional Batak religion are still practised alongside Christianity. Creation myths Puppeteers of Toba Batak people with a Sigale Gale puppet, Sumatra. There are many different versions in circulation. These were formerly passed down through oral tradition but have now been written down in the local languages. There are also large collections of Batak tales collected by European scholars since the mid-19th century and recorded in European languages, mostly Dutch.Much of this section is derived from Stohr, W. & Zoeta Jadider, P. (1965) \\"Die Religionen Indonesiens.\\" Die Religionen der Menschheit, vol. 5:1, Stuttgart. At the beginning of time there was only the sky with a great sea beneath it. In the sky lived the gods and the sea was the home of a mighty underworld dragon Naga Padoha. The earth did not yet exist and human beings, too, were as yet unknown. All the surviving myths record that at the beginning of creation stands the god Mula Jadi Na Bolon. His origin remains uncertain. A rough translation of the name is the \\"beginning of becoming\\". The creation of everything that exists can be traced back to him. Mula Jadi lives in the upper world which is usually thought of as divided into seven levels. His three sons, Batara Guru, Mangalabulan and Soripada were born from eggs laid by a hen fertilized by Mula Jadi. Two swallows act as messengers and helpers to Mula Jadi in his act of creation. Their functions vary in the different versions. Mula Jadi begets three daughters whom he gives as wives for his three sons. Mankind is the result of the union of the three couples. Besides the three sons of Mula Jadi there is another god, Asiasi, whose place and function in the world of the gods remains largely unclear. There is some evidence that Asiasi can be seen as the balance and unity of the trinity of gods. The ruler of the underworld, i. e. the primeval sea, is the serpent-dragon Naga Padoha. He too existed before the beginning and seems to be the opponent of Mula Jadi. As ruler of the underworld Naga Padoha also has an important function in the creation of the earth. What all the six gods so far mentioned have in common is that they play a minor role in ritual. They do not receive any sacrificial offerings from the faithful and no places of sacrifice are built for them. They are merely called on in prayers for help and assistance.Leertouwer, L. (1977) Her beeld van de ziel bij drie Sumatraanse votken. Doctoral dissertation in Theology. Groningen, p. 177. The origin of the earth and of mankind is connected mainly with the daughter of Batara Guru, Sideak Parujar, who is the actual creator of the earth. She flees from her intended husband, the lizard-shaped son of Mangalabulan, and lets herself down on a spun thread from the sky to the middle world which at that time was still just a watery waste. She refuses to go back but feels very unhappy. Out of compassion Mula Jadi sends his granddaughter a handful of earth so that she can find somewhere to live. Sideak Parudjar was ordered to spread out this earth and thus the earth became broad and long. But the goddess was not able to enjoy her rest for long. The earth had been spread out on the head of Naga Padoha, the dragon of the underworld who lived in the water. He groaned under the weight and attempted to get rid of it by rolling around. The earth was softened by water and threatened to be utterly destroyed. With the help of Mula Jadi and by her own cunning Sideak Parudjar was able to overcome the dragon. She thrust a sword into the body of Naga Padoha up to the hilt and laid him in an iron block. Whenever Naga Padoha twists in the fetters an earthquake occurs. After the lizard-shaped son of Mangalabulan, the husband the gods intended for her, had taken another name and another form, Sideak Parujar marries him. Sideak Parujar becomes the mother of twins of different sexes. When the two have grown up their divine parents return to the upper world leaving the couple behind on the earth. Mankind is the result of their incestuous union. The couple settle on Pusuk Buhit, a volcano on the western shore of Lake Toba, and found the village of Si Anjur Mulamula. The mythological ancestor of the Batak, Si Raja Batak is one of their grandchildren.Sibeth, p. 65. The tendi cult A 20th century carved bone of a Porhalaan Batak calendar. In the religious world of the Toba and Karo Batak the gods and the creation of mankind are far less significant than the complex concepts connected with the tendi (Karo) or tondi (Toba) and the begu. Probably the most useful translations of these terms are \\"life-soul\\" and \\"death-soul\\". A person receives his \\"life-soul\\" (tendi) from Mula Jadi Na Bolon before he is born. The destiny of the individual tendi is decided by the tendi itself before birth. Various myths are woven around manner in which the tendi choose their destiny from Mula Jadi. Warneck, a missionary and for a long time superintendent (ephorus) of the Batak Church, recorded two particularly expressive myths in his major work on Batak religion.Adapted from Warneck, J. (1977) Tcba-Batak: Deutsches Wörterbuch. The Hague. What is significant is that the tendi themselves are responsible for their idiocy: :\\"Mula Jadi presents him with all kinds of things to choose from. If the tendi asks for ripe eggs, then the person whom he animates will be a poor fellow; if he asks for flowers, then he will live only a short time; if he asks for a hen, the person will be restless; rags indicate poverty; an old mat, lack of fame; a gold piece, wealth; plate, spear, medicine pot indicate that he will become a great chief or understand magic arts.\\" :\\"With Mula Jadi in the upper world is a mighty tree called Djambubarus. Mula Jadi has written on all its leaves. On one leaf is written 'many children', on others 'wealth' or 'respect' and so on. 'Contemptible life', 'poverty', 'wretchedness' are also written on the leaves. All the possible different fates of the person are entered on the leaves. Every tendi that wishes to descend to the middle world must first ask Mula Jadi for one of the leaves. Whatever is written on the leaf chosen by him will be his destiny in the middle world.\\" Among the Karo and the Toba there are sometimes widely diverging versions of where the tendi dwells and how many tendi there are. According to the Toba a person has seven tendi. The second tendi is found in the placenta and amniotic fluid of the new-born baby, and accordingly the afterbirth is given special attention after the birth of a child. It is usually buried under the house, is called saudara (brother) and is regarded as the person's guardian spirit. Similar ideas about the afterbirth are also found among the Karo, who also bury the placenta and amniotic fluid under the house and regard them as two guardian spirits (kaka and agi) who always remain close to the person.Westenberg CJ, (1982) Aanteekeningen omtrent de godsdienstige begrippen der Karo-Bataks. BK141:208-53 All Batak regard the loss of tendi as signifying a great danger for \\"body and soul\\". Tendi can be separated from their owners through inattentiveness, or as a result of black magic by a datu with evil intentions. In other words, the tendi is not tied to the body; it can also live for a time outside the body. The final loss of the tendi inevitably results in death. There are a variety of ideas about where exactly in the body the tendi dwells. It is present to a particularly high degree in certain parts of the body, especially the blood, the liver, the head and the heart. Sweat too is described as rich in tendi. It is believed that illnesses are connected with the absence of tendi, and the bringing back of the tendi is a main method of healing. The Karo, for instance, have gifts, called upah tendi (upah = wage, payment, gift), which they give to their tendi so that their tendi stay with them. These gifts may consist of a knife, a gong, a particular piece of clothing, a water buffalo or a small holy place. The gifts are carefully cared for in order to keep the tendi satisfied.Kipp, RS, 1974 \\"Karo Batak Religion and Social Structure.\\" Berita Kajian Sumatra(Sumatra Research Bulletin), University of Hull 3,2:4-11. Tendi love the sound of the surdam (a bamboo flute). If a tendi has abandoned the body of a patient, the playing of the surdam in the raleng tendi ritual can contribute to the tendi returning to the body of the sick person. It must be emphasized that only the datuk are in a position to interpret and influence people's tendi correctly. If their endeavors are unsuccessful, then clearly the tendi has chosen another destiny for itself.Sibeth, P. 87. Death cult Batak Totem pole. At death the tendi leaves the human body through the fontanelle and the \\"death-soul\\" (begu) is set free. It is thought that the tendi vanishes and after the death of any human being only the begu continues to exist. The Batak believe that the begu continue to live near their previous dwelling (in a village of the dead which is thought to be situated not far from the cemetery) and that they may contact their descendants. Bad dreams, particular misfortune and such like may be signs that the begu of an ancestor is not satisfied with the behavior of its descendants. Any individual can attempt to pacify an enraged begu by means of food and drink offerings and prayers. If this does not work, a datu or a guru must be called in.Kipp, 1974, p. 11. The begu are not immortal, since death also rules in the land of the dead: a begu dies seven times before it is changed into a straw and finally becomes earth.Sibeth, p. 69. The Batak believe that three categories of begu exist.Westenberg, p. 221. The bicara guru are the begu of stillborn babies or of babies who have died before teething. It is possible to turn bicara guru into guardian spirits if misfortune has befallen the family of the child shortly after its death. With the help of a guru sibaso, the bicara guru can be made the family's guardian spirit for which a shrine is provided and to which sacrifices are regularly made. Once a year the bicara guru is accorded a special feast, preceded by ritual hair washing. The begu of members of the family who have had a sudden death (mate sada-uari) can also act as guardian spirits for the family. They include the victims of accidents, suicides, murder victims, or people struck by lightning. A shrine is built where they are venerated and where sacrifices are made. A third category consists of the begu of dead virgins (tungkup). Their graves, called bata-bata or ingan tungkup, are maintained for a long time by their relatives. Burial traditions A stone sarcophagus in a Toba Batak village. Batak burial traditions are very rich and complex. Immediately after death various ritual actions are performed to make the begu understand that from now on its world is separate from that of its kin. Symbolically this is done by reversing the mat on which the corpse is laid out so that the body lies with its head at the foot of the mat. Thumbs and toes respectively are tied together and the body is rubbed all over with camphor and its orifices stopped with camphor, then it is wrapped in a white cotton cloth. During this perumah begu ceremony a guru sibaso declares to the begu of the deceased that it is definitely dead and must take leave of its relatives. Wealthier families have their coffins (Karo: pelangkah) made of the wood of the kemiri tree (Aleurites moluccanus), carved in the shape of a boat, its bow decorated with the carved head of a hornbill, or a horse, or a mythical beast known as a singa. The lid is then sealed with resin and the coffin may be placed in a special location near the family's house until a reburial ceremony can take place. Families that are not wealthy use simple wooden coffins or wrap the body in a straw mat. The corpse is carried a few times round the house, usually by women, and then to the cemetery with musical accompaniment from the gondang orchestra and the continual firing of guns. At any crossroads the corpse is put down and eleven people go around it four times to confuse the begu. It is hoped that the begu will then be unable to find its way back to the village. When the funeral procession arrives at the cemetery the grave is dug and the corpse laid in it, flat on its back. Care is taken that the head lies towards the village so that, in the unexpected event that the body should get up, he or she will not be looking in the direction of the village. The bodies of datuk and those who have died from lightning are buried sitting up with their hands tied together. The palms of the hand are tied together and betel placed between them.Kipp, 1974, p. 9 Reburial Batak tugu on the island of Samosir, Lake Toba, December 1984. The burial tradition includes a reburial ceremony in which the bones of one's ancestors are reinterred several years after death. This secondary burial is known among the Toba Batak as mangongkal holi, among the Karo as nurun-nurun. In a ceremony lasting several days the bones of a particularly honored ancestor and those of his descendants are exhumed, cleaned, mourned and finally laid to rest again in a bone house known as a tugu or tambak: :\\"On the morning of the first day of the festival the graves in the cemetery are opened and the bones of the ancestors that are still there are removed. The unearthing of the skulls is presented as especially moving. The bones are collected in baskets lined with white cloth and then ritually cleaned by the women using the juice of various citrus fruits. The exhumation and cleaning of the bones is accompanied by the singing of laments. The bones are kept in the baskets in the tugu until the next morning, when the remains are wrapped in traditional cloths (ulos) and transferred from the baskets to small wooden coffins. After long speeches and a communal prayer the coffins are nailed down and placed in the chambers of the tugu. A feast consisting of meat and rice follows and traditional dances are performed.Simon, A. (1982) \\"Altreligiose und soziale Zeremonien der Batak.\\" ZjE 107:177-206.\\" In ancient times these sarcophagi were carved from stone or constructed from wood and later brick. Nowadays they are made of cement or concrete. Large and very ornate tugu can be seen around Lake Toba and on the island of Samosir. One motive for the reburial ceremony appears to be to raise the status of the begu of the deceased. Traditional Batak beliefs hold that the dead occupy a hierarchical status similar to the social position they held in life. This means that a rich and powerful individual remains influential after death, and this status can be elevated if the family holds a reburial ceremony. A rich descendant can advance a begu to the status of a sumangot by means of a great ceremony and a horja feast which can last up to seven days. In antiquity a vast number of pigs, cattle or even buffalo were slaughtered at such festivals, and the gondang orchestra provided an accompaniment. The next level up from the sumangot is the sombaon, who are the spirits of important ancestors who lived ten to twelve generations ago. To raise a sumangot to a sombaon requires another great festival, a santi rea, often lasting several months, during which the inhabitants of the whole district come together. These powerful ancestor spirits offer protection and good fortune to their descendants, but the ceremony also serves to establish new kinship groups descended from the ancestor thus honored.Stohr, p. 197. Traditional Batak medicine Laguboti in 1984. She is consulting a paperback edition of the New Testament in lieu of a pustaha. On the shelf are components of herbal remedies. In front of her is a kaffir lime in a bowl of water, a form of divination used to locate lost items or people. In traditional Batak society datuk (animist priests) as well as gurus practiced traditional medicine, although the former were exclusively male. Both professions were attributed with supernatural powers and the ability to predict the future. Treatments and healing rituals bear some resemblance to those practiced by dukuns in other parts of Indonesia. Following the Christianization of the Toba and Karo Batak in the late 19th century, missionaries discouraged traditional healing and divination and they became largely clandestine activities.Sibeth, p. 98 Both datu and guru healers also practiced divination by consulting a pustaha, a handwritten book made of wood and bark in which were inscribed recipes for healing remedies, incantations and songs, predictive calendars, and other notes on magic, healing and divination written in poda, an archaic Batak shorthand. According to Winkler,J. Winkler, Die Toba-Batak auf Sumatra in gesunden und kranken Tagen, [The Toba Bataks of Sumatra in Sickness and in Health] (1925), pp. 79-224. there were three categories of Pustaha based on the purpose of their usage: :1. Protective Magic, which includes diagnosis, therapy, medicinal mixes which have magical properties, such as amulets, parmanisan (love charms), etc. :2. Destructive Magic, which encompasses the art of making poison, the art of controlling or utilizing the power of certain spirits, calling the pangulubalang, and the art of making dorma (magical formulas for causing a person to fall in love). :3. Divination, which involves oracles (words of the gods), the wishes of the spirits, commands from the gods and from the spirits of the ancestors, and an almanac or calendrical system (porhalaan), and astrology to determine auspicious days and months to accomplish certain actions or goals.Voorma, pp. 71-77. The datu or guru consulted the pustaha when presented with a difficult problem, and in time this became in itself a ritual. When missionaries began to discourage traditional healing and augury the Bible may have been adopted by some gurus in place of the pustaha. Among the most important healing ceremonies performed in Toba and Karo communities is that of recalling the jinujung, or personal guardian spirit. According to Toba and Karo cosmology, each person receives a jinujung in childhood or at puberty and they keep it for life unless they are unfortunate enough to lose it, in which case they will fall ill. In order to call the jinujung back, a female guru (guru sibaso in Karo) goes into a trance and the jinujung will enter into her and speak through her mouth. At this time the sick person or the family can negotiate ritual payment to entice it to return.Sibeth, p. 68. Traditional healers are not powerful enough to cure illness due to the loss of a person's tendi (this falls under the jurisdiction of the datuk), however they do play a role in communicating with begu and influencing their behavior.Sibeth, p. 67. Malim A magic book or Pustaha used by datu or guru (wizards) of the Toba Batak people, North Sumatra, Indonesia as seen in the State Museum of Ethnology, Leiden, Netherlands. Malim is the modern form of the Batak Toba religion. Practitioners of Malim are called Parmalim.Thejakartapost.com Non-Malim Batak peoples (those following Christian or Muslim faith) often continue to believe certain aspects of traditional Batak spiritual belief. The 'Perodak-odak' movement among the Karo people in the 1960s was a reassertion of the traditional Karo religion, but has largely faded; a subsequent Karo movement to identify as Hindu was noted starting from the late 1970s in order to adopt, if only in name, one of the recognised religions of Indonesia, while in practice still following traditional beliefs.History of Christianity in Indonesia, p. 579 Religions=Christianity At the time of Marco Polo's visit in 1292 the people were described as \\"wild idolaters\\" who had not been influenced by outside religions, however by Ibn Battuta's visit in 1345 Arab traders had established river-ports along the northern coasts of Sumatra and Sultan Al-Malik Al-Dhahir had recently converted to Islam. Sir Stamford Raffles perceived the Batak lands as a buffer between the Islamic Aceh and Minang kingdoms, and encouraged Christian missionary work to preserve this. This policy was continued by the Dutch, who deemed the non-Muslim lands the 'Bataklanden'. In 1824 two British Baptist missionaries, Richard Burton and Nathaniel Ward, set off on foot from Sibolga and traveled through the Batak lands.Burton, R. and Ward, N., \\"Report of a Journey into the Batak Country, in the interior of Sumatra, in the year 1824.\\" Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, London 1:485-513. After three days' journey they reached the high valley of Silindung and spent about two weeks in the Batak region. Considering the shortness of their stay their account reveals very intensive first-hand observation. This was followed in 1834 by Henry Lyman (missionary) and Samuel Munson from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions who met with a more hostile reception.\\"Missionaries: The Martyrs of Sumatra,\\" in The Most of It: Essays on Language and the Imagination. by Theodore Baird, Amherst, Mass.: Amherst College Press, 1999. According to Ida Pfeiffer: :\\"Some time before the arrival of the missionaries the unfortunate Americans presented themselves as religious teachers,the Battakers felt that these people were invaders, and resolving to be beforehand with their tormentors, they killed them and ate them up.\\"Pfeiffer, p. 150. Professor Uli Kozok disputes the belief that the missionaries were eaten. See his discussion. Herman Neubronner van der Tuuk was employed by the Nederlands Bijbel Genootschap (Netherlands Bible Society) in the 1850s to produce a Batak–Dutch grammar-book and a dictionary, which enabled future Dutch and German missionaries to undertake the conversion of the Toba and Simalungan Batak.Tuuk, H. N. van der, Bataksch Leesbok, Stukken in het Mandailingsch; Stukken in het Dairisch. Amsterdam, 1861. The first German missionaries to the Lake Toba region arrived in 1861, and a mission was established in 1881 by Dr. Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen of the German Rhenish Missionary Society. The New Testament was first translated into Toba Batak by Dr. Nommensen in 1869 and a translation of the Old Testament was completed by P. H. Johannsen in 1891. The complete text was printed in Latin script in Medan in 1893, although a paper describes the translation as “not easy to read, it is rigid and not fluent, and sounds strange to the Batak…[with] a number of errors in the translation.” The Toba and Karo Batak accepted Christianity rapidly and by the early 20th century it had become part of their cultural identity. This period was characterized by the arrival of Dutch colonists and while most Batak did not oppose the Dutch, the Toba Batak fought a guerrilla war that lasted into the early 20th century and ended only with the death in 1907 of their charismatic priest-warrior-king Si Sisingamangaraja XII, who had battled the Dutch during the First Toba War with both magic and weaponry. =Batak churches= Huria Kristen Batak Protestan (HKBP) Church in Balige, North Sumatra, built circa 1917. The Huria Kristen Batak Protestan (HKBP) Church was established in Balige in September, 1917. By the late 1920s a nursing school was training nurse midwives there. In 1941, the Gereja Batak Karo Protestan (GBKP) was established.Kushnick, G. \\"Parent- Offspring Conflict Among the Karo of Sumatra,\\" Doctoral dissertation, University of Washington, Seattle, 2006 Although missionaries ceded much power to Batak converts in the first decades of the 20th century, Bataks never pressured the missionaries to leave and only took control of church activities as a result of thousands of foreign missionaries being interned or forced to leaveKipp, 1990, p. 211. after the 1942 invasion of Sumatra by the Japanese.Archer B. The internment of Western civilians under the Japanese 1941-1945: a patchwork of internment. London ; Portland, OR: F. Cass, 2004. The Gereja Kristen Protestan Simalungun, originally part of the HKBP and preaching in Batak Toba language, eventually became a distinctively Simalungun church, adopting Simalungun customs and language, before finally incorporating as GKPS in 1963. Islam The Mandailing and Angkola people, occupying the southern Batak lands, came under the influence of the neighbouring Islamic Minangkabau people as a result of the Padri War (1821–1837). Some Mandailing had previously converted to Islam, but the Padri war was a watershed event, with the Padri Wahabbis suppressing traditional customs (adat) and promoting 'pure' Islamic faith. Over time Mandailing Islam, has been brought closer to the predominant Southeastern Shafi\`i school of Islam as a result of Mandailing discourse with other Islamic practitioners and the practice of hajj, although traditional elements remain, such as dividing inheritance among all children, a Mandailing rather than Islamic practice. Islam caused the decline in importance of marga, with many Mandailing abandoning their marga in favour of Muslim names, much less so among the Angkola to their North. The advent of Islam also caused the relegation of the datuk to a medicine man, with traditional rice-planting ceremonies and other such remnants of traditional culture deemed incompatible with Islam. The 'pasusur begu', a ceremony invoking ancestors to aid the community, was also suppressed. Other aspects of adat were however tolerated, with the Mandailing Islamic ideology placing adat on the same level as Islamic law, as in contrast with the Minang practice of placing Islamic law above adat. In more recent times, learned Islamic scholars (ulama) studying abroad, have suggested that many traditional Mandailing practices, such as the 'Raja' hereditary leaders, were in conflict with Islam, being indicative of 'pele begu'. The Islamist ulama were in conflict for authority with the Namora-Natora, the traditional village legal practitioners, who were influenced by adat as much as Islam. Christian missionaries had been active among the northern Mandailing from 1834 onwards, but their progress was restricted by the Dutch government, who feared conflict between newly converted Christians and Muslims. In addition, the lingua franca of the government was Malay, associated with Muslims, as were government civil servants, creating the perception that Islam was the religion of modernity and progress. Missionaries determined that resistance among the Muslim Mandailing to Christianity was strong, and the missionaries abandoned them as 'unreachable people', moving north to evangelize the Toba. At the turn of the 20th century, nearly all Mandailing and Angkola were Muslims. Despite this, the Dutch administration marked them as part of the Bataklanden, and therefore heathen or Christian. This perception was an inaccurate one, and many Mandailing strongly rejected the 'Batak' label. Abdullah Lubis, writing in the 1920s, claimed that while the Mandailing followed Batak marga practice, they had never followed the Batak religion, and that the Mandailing people pre- dated the Toba, having acquired marga directly from 'Hindu' visitors. In the Dutch census, the Mandailing objected strongly to being listed in the census as 'Batak Mandailing'. Mandailing in Malaysia (who migrated in the years following the Padri war), had no such objection to their being deemed 'Malays', and indeed Malaysian Mandailing retain little of their distinct identity, partly due to a British colonial policy of rice-land ownership restrictions for all but Malay-speaking Muslims, and the disapproval of 'Batak' Muslim practices by the existing Malay Muslim population.

Since ancient times, the Batak have inhabited a series of river valleys along the coastline of what is today Puerto Princesa City. There are only about 450 Batak remaining according to a 1990 census. Also called Tinitianes, the Batak are considered by anthropologists to be closely related to the Aeta of Central Luzon, another Negrito tribe.

Still, there is some debate as to whether the Batak are related to the other Negrito groups of the Philippines or actually to other, physically similar groups in Indonesia or as far away as the Andaman Islands.  History  The Batak have for centuries combined a hunting- gathering lifestyle with seeding of useful food plants, kaingin, a slash and burn farming method, and trading. The Batak had important trading connections with the maritime peoples of the Sulu region for many centuries of their history. They traded natural and forest goods in exchange for manufactured products. The Batak were largely undisturbed until the arrival of the Americans in the final years of the nineteenth century. The reason for this was due to the Bataks being within the margins of mainstream Filipino political and cultural life. Since 1900, Filipinos and others began to migrate to the traditional regions where the Batak lived. This led to the resources and land of the Bataks to dwindle. In the 1930s, the government attempted to establish reservations for the Batak in the coastal plains but these soon were settled and overran by the Filipino migrants in the 1950s. This caused the Batak to move inland into the interior of the island. During the mid to late-20th century the Batak were easily pushed out of their preferred gathering grounds by the sea into the mountains by emigrant farmers, mostly from Luzon. Living in less fertile areas, they have attempted to supplement their income by harvesting and selling various nontimber forest products, such as rattan, tree resins, and honey. This has been met with resistance by the government and commercial collectors, who assert that the Batak have no legal right to these resources. Conservationists, however, have taken an interest in the Batak's collection methods, which are much more sustainable than the techniques used by commercial concessionaires. The Batak's way of life and survival is threatened by dwindling forest resources, partly due to mining activities. Communities also experience high infant mortality and low birth rates. The Batak are working to acquire Certificates of Ancestral Domains Titles for their traditional lands in Puerto Princesa.  Culture  The Batak were once a nomadic people, but have since, at the behest of the government, settled in small villages. Still, they often go on gathering trips into the forest for a few days at a time, an activity which has both economic and spiritual value for them. Their belief system is that of animism, which is belief in spirits that reside in nature. They classify spirits into the \\"Panya'en\\" who are malevolent and the \\"Diwata\\" are generally benevolent but are also capricious. Batak make regular offerings to these spirits, and Shamans undergo spiritual possession in order to communicate with the spirits and heal the sick. Rapid depopulation, restricted forest access, sedentary living, and incursion by immigrants has devastated the group culturally. Today, very few Batak marry other Batak but tend to marry from other neighboring groups. The pattern has been that the children of these marriages tend not to follow Batak cultural ways, and today \\"pure\\" Batak are rare. They are also not reproducing to sustain their population. As a result, Batak are being absorbed into a more diffuse group of upland indigenous peoples who are slowing losing their tribal identities, and with it their unique spirituality and culture; there is even some debate as to whether or not they still exist as a distinct ethnic entity. Batak families trace descent through both sides of the family. Kin relationships are similar to those of the Filipinos. Since the Batak are discouraged from using the birth name of their in-laws, they have multiple personal names. Divorce and remarriage used to be common and acceptable among the Batak but integration to mainstream Filipino society has changed this to a degree. Husbands and wives usually enjoy equal freedoms though the wives tend to live in their husband's household except for the early stages of the marriage when both live in the wife's household. Nuclear households are the basic economic unit though multiple households can and do pool their resources. However, the nuclear household is expected to be self- reliant. Batak households tend to have few children with the average being 3.5 persons.  Subsistence  The Batak today engage in many occupations which includes foraging, selling forest derived goods, shifting cultivation, and workers under Filipino farmers or other employers. Primary food for the Batak were squirrels, jungle fowls, wild pigs, honey, fruits, yams, fish, mollusks, crustaceans and more. The main source for these food items come from the forests in the region. The Batak used many methods to capture animals like pigs with the use of bows and arrows, spears, dogs, or homemade guns which varied as time passed and foreign influence increased. When it came to trading, the Batak mostly sold rattan, honey, and Manila copal. In return, they received clothing materials, rice and other goods. A few Batak also cultivate rice, corn, sweet potato, and cassava. Wage labor for nearby farmers is important to the Batak economy. Batak men are usually hired out for a few days to do certain work like clearing weeds, harvesting, or to pick coconuts and coffee. Local tourism is also a source of revenue for the Bataks.

It was designed by Guymer Bailey Architects Pty. Ltd. and built in 1996 as the first privately designed, financed and operated prison in Victoria. The centre is named after welfare worker and philanthropist Dame Phyllis Frost who was well known for her commitment to unpopular causes, most notably helping women prisoners. It is Victoria's largest women's prison and holds 604 prisoners.McKenzie, Nick, \\"Behind the wire\\", The Age, 18 February 2008 It is one of only two women's prisons in Victoria, the other being HM Prison Tarrengower. As HM Prison Tarrengower is minimum security mainstream, all other female prisoners (medium security, maximum security, and all protection prisoners) are imprisoned at the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre. The prison facility was opened on 15 August 1996 and received its first prisoners that same month, many of whom had been transferred from Fairlea Women's Prison. On 3 October 2000, the government took control of the facility and appointed an administrator under section 8F of the Corrections Act, and section 27B of the prison contract to operate the prison. On 2 November 2000, the Minister for Corrections announced the transfer of ownership and management of MWCC to the public sector. Notable incidents On 24 October 2003, a male prison guard was charged with raping a mentally ill prisoner who was found to be pregnant when she was transferred to the Thomas Embling Hospital, a secured psychiatric hospital, and DNA tests revealed the prison guard was the father. The guard pleaded not guilty to the charges. In December 2007, a Department of Justice and Regulation office filing cabinet which was being moved to new offices was mistakenly discarded at a second-hand furniture shop and bought by a Point Cook couple who discovered abandoned documents in the cabinet. After lengthy court action, documents from the filing cabinet were released and revealed allegations of corruption and sexual abuse at the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre. In November 2009, it was reported in the media that heroin and methamphetamine were \\"readily available\\" in the jail and that there had been a large increase in drug overdoses and suicide attempts among inmates at the prison.

In an inflated market, a consumer, despite having broader market knowledge might pay an inflated price because of their needs and the local related-market value. Another consumer relative to their needs and assessment of market value may deem the price excessive. Thus to one consumer the commodity has a greater value than to another making the former look like a fool to the latter. Examples In times of hyper- inflation and in remote regions the price of necessities is so exorbitant that relative to normal markets these prices may seem arbitrary. Yet the local cost of doing business relative to the price in these regions, as well as the necessity to feed and shelter one's self in a hyper-inflationary crisis, justifies through profit or actual benefit the \\"foolish\\" price. In real estate, the greater fool theory can drive investment through the expectation that prices always rise. A period of rising prices may cause lenders to underestimate the risk of default. A Ponzi scheme is a form of investor fraud where earlier investors are paid from the money gained by more recent investors. In order to stay afloat Ponzi schemes rely on a continuous supply of greater fools who are willing to buy into the scheme. Although a share in such a scheme has no value whatsoever, so long as more greater fools buy into it, it can remain profitable for the investors involved. In the stock market, the greater fool theory applies when many investors make a questionable investment, with the assumption that they will be able to sell it later to \\"a greater fool\\". In other words, they buy something not because they believe that it is worth the price, but rather because they believe that they will be able to sell it to someone else at an even higher price. It is also called survivor investing. It is similar in concept to the Keynesian beauty contest principle of stock investing. Art is another commodity in which speculation and privileged access drive prices, not intrinsic value. In November 2013, hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen of SAC Capital was selling at auction artworks that he had only recently acquired through private transactions. Works included paintings by Gerhard Richter and Rudolf Stingel and a sculpture by Cy Twombly. They were expected to sell for up to $80 million. In reporting the sale, The New York Times noted: > \\"Ever the trader, Mr. Cohen is also taking advantage of today’s active art > market where new collectors will often pay far more for artworks than they > are worth.\\" See also * Arbitrage * Speculation * Bagholder * Economic bubble * Tulip mania * Beanie Babies * Subjective Theory of Value References Investment ja:株価 ","title":"Greater fool theory"},{"id":"1335239","text":"Killmaster may refer to: * Nick Carter-Killmaster, a series of spy adventures published from 1964 until the late 1990s * Killmaster, Michigan, an unincorporated community in Alcona County ","title":"Killmaster"},{"id":"1335241","text":"Peoria and East Peoria, Illinois are separated by the Illinois River, a long body of water that reaches up to a mile across in places along Peoria Lake.

It was directed by Steve Barron and stars Lenny Von Dohlen, Virginia Madsen, Maxwell Caulfield, and the voice of Bud Cort. The film's credits dedicate it to the memory of UNIVAC I.  Plot  Miles Harding is an architect who envisions a brick shaped like a jigsaw puzzle piece that could enable buildings to withstand earthquakes. Seeking a way to get organized, he buys a personal computer to help him develop his ideas. Although he is initially unsure that he will even be able to correctly operate the computer, he later buys numerous extra gadgets that were not necessary for his work, such as switches to control household appliances like the blender, a speech synthesizer, and a microphone. The computer addresses Miles as \\"Moles\\", because Miles had incorrectly typed his name during the initial set-up. When Miles attempts to download the entire database from a mainframe computer at work, his computer begins to overheat. In a state of panic, Miles uses a nearby bottle of champagne to douse the overheating machine, which then becomes sentient. Miles initially is unaware of the computer's newfound sentience, but discovers it one night when he is awakened by the computer in the middle of the night when it mimics Miles talking in his sleep. A love triangle soon develops among Miles, his computer (who later identifies himself as Edgar), and Miles's neighbor, an attractive cellist named Madeline Robistat. Upon hearing her practicing Minuet in G major, BWV Anh. 114 from Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach on her cello through an air vent connecting both apartments, Edgar promptly elaborates a parallel variation of the piece, leading to an improvised duet. Believing it was Miles who had engaged her in the duet, Madeline begins to fall in love with him though she has an ongoing relationship with fellow musician Bill. At Miles's request, Edgar composes a piece of music for Madeline. When their mutual love becomes evident, however, Edgar responds with jealousy, canceling Miles's credit cards and registering him as an \\"armed and dangerous\\" criminal. Upon discovering this humiliation, Miles and Edgar have a confrontation, where Miles shoves the computer and tries to unplug it, getting an electric shock. Then the computer retaliates by harassing him with an improvised maze of remotely controlled household electronics, in the style of Pac-Man. Eventually, Edgar accepts Madeline and Miles's love for each other, and appears to commit suicide by sending a large electric current out through his acoustic coupler modem, around the world, and finally reaching back to himself just after he and Miles make amends. Later as Madeline and Miles go on vacation together, Edgar's voice is heard on the radio dedicating a song to \\"the ones I love\\", titled \\"Together in Electric Dreams\\". The credits are interspersed with scenes of the song being heard all over California, including a radio station trying to shut it off, declaring that they do not know where the signal is coming from.

She particularly liked one he did for Haysi Fantayzee; she was doing continuity on Yentl, co-produced by Rusty Lemorande and showed it to him. Lemorande had finished his own script for Electric Dreams and was looking for a director; he offered Barron the job. Barron took the script to Virgin Films, and it agreed to finance within four days. The film was presold to MGM/UA who brought rights for the U.S., Canada, Japan and South East Asia. Two months after Virgin agreed to make the movie, filming began in San Francisco. Studio work was done in London at Twickenham Studios. Virginia Madsen later recalled she \\"was very spoiled on that movie, because it was such a lovefest that I now believe that every movie should be like that ... I had a mad, crazy crush on Lenny Von Dohlen. God, we were so ... we were head-over-heels for each other. Nothing happened, and at this point, I admit it: I wanted it to happen ... He's still one of my best friends.\\"Will Harris, \\"Virginia Madsen on smelling Christopher Walken, getting tax advice from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and more\\", Random Roles – AV Club,, 19 July 2013, accessed 26 July 2013 Bud Cort provided the voice of the computer. The director did not want Cort to be seen by the other actors during scenes so Cort had to do his lines in a padded box on a sound stage. He said, \\"It got a little lonely in there, I must admit. I kept waiting to meet the other actors, but nobody came to say hello.\\" Boy George visited the set and, being a fan of Harold and Maude, got Cort's autograph. The computer hardware company's name in the film is \\"Pinecone\\", a play on Apple Computer. The movie features music from Giorgio Moroder, Culture Club, Jeff Lynne (Electric Light Orchestra), and Heaven 17. During filming, Barron said, \\"The fact that there's so much music has to do with the success of Flashdance. This film isn't Flashdance 2. Flashdance worked because of the dancing. It didn't have a story. Electric Dreams does.\\" Barron later said \\"Electric Dreams was definitely an attempt to try and weave the early 1980s music video genre into a movie. ... [The film] isn't that deep. The closest parallel is probably that it's a Cyrano de Bergerac-like exploration of how words and music can help nurture and grow feelings on the path to love. Oops that's too deep.\\"\\"CHILD AT HEART : STEVEN BARRON ON MICHAEL, MADONNA & MERLIN\\" Almost Kael accessed 20 January 2015 In 2015, he said when he made the film there was a prejudice against video clip directors doing drama, and because Electric Dreams \\"was a little bit like an extended music video...

(laughs)\\".\\"The Man Who Defined The Music Video: Our Interview With Steve Barron\\" Culture Brats 4 August 2011, accessed 20 January 2015 Fans of Electric Dreams have noted the similarities between the film and Spike Jonze's Her. When asked about it, Jonze claimed not to have seen the former film. In 2009 Barron said that Madsen told him she was planning on being involved in a remake. He said, \\"She didn't ask me to do it, so I guess I blew my chance on the first one! I wouldn't actually do it, but it would have been nice for the ego to be asked.\\"  Music  The soundtrack features music from prominent popular musicians of the time, being among the movies of this generation that actively explored the commercial link between a movie and its soundtrack. The soundtrack album Electric Dreams was re-issued on CD in 1998. Steve Barron later recalled:  Release = Critical reception  On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 44% based on 16 reviews. The New York Times said that the film failed to \\"blend and balance its ingredients properly\\", and that it lost plot elements and taxed credibility. The Los Angeles Times called it \\"inspired and appealing... a romantic comedy of genuine sweetness and originality\\". Film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert each gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, with Siskel writing that it showed a new director eager to show off his talents and Ebert writing \\"One of the nicest things about the movie is the way it maintains its note of slightly bewildered innocence.\\"  Home media  Electric Dreams was released in 1984 (VHS) and again in 1991 (VHS) in the US. MGM Home Video released a Laserdisc in America in 1985, and Warner Bros. released a Video CD version for the Singapore market in 2001. The film received a Region 2 DVD on April 6, 2009 by MGM (which owns Orion Pictures and international rights to the Virgin/M.E.C.G film catalog they purchased in the mid 90s). UK video label Second Sight has released a Blu-ray on 7 August 2017, making its worldwide debut.

It is found in the western and central United States, northern Mexico, and south-central Canada to certain areas of southwestern British Columbia. The American badger's habitat is typified by open grasslands with available prey (such as mice, squirrels, and groundhogs). The species prefers areas such as prairie regions with sandy loam soils where it can dig more easily for its prey. Taxonomy The American badger is a member of the Mustelidae, a diverse family of carnivorous mammals that also includes weasels, otters, ferrets, and the wolverine. The American badger belongs to the Taxidiinae, one of four subfamilies of mustelid badgers – the other three being the Melinae (4 species, including the European badger), the Helictidinae (5 species of ferret-badgers) and the Mellivorinae (honey badger); the so-called stink badgers are mephitids. The American badger's closest relative is the prehistoric Chamitataxus. Among extant mustelids, the American badger is the most basal species; its lineage is thought to have split off from the rest of Mustelidae about 18 million years (Ma) ago, following the split of mustelids from procyonids about 29 Ma ago. Recognized subspecies include: *T. t. taxus (the nominate subspecies), found in central Canada and the central U.S.; *T. t. jacksoni, found in the southern Great Lakes region, including southern Ontario; *T. t. jeffersoni, in British Columbia and the western U.S.; *T. t. berlandieri, in the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico. Ranges of subspecies overlap considerably, with intermediate forms occurring in the areas of overlap. In Mexico, this animal is sometimes called tlalcoyote. The Spanish word for badger is tejón, but in Mexico this word is also used to describe the coati. This can lead to confusion, as both coatis and badgers are found in Mexico. Description Adult female American badger (sow) The American badger has most of the general characteristics common to badgers; with stocky and low-slung bodies with short, powerful legs, they are identifiable by their huge foreclaws (measuring up to 5 cm in length) and distinctive head markings. American badgers possess morphological characteristics that enables them to be good fossorial specialists such as a conical head, bristles on the ears and nictitating membranes in the eyes. American badgers have powerful forelimbs. They also possess a strong humerus and large bony processes for the attachment of muscles. The mechanical advantage in badger forelimbs is increased by the specialized olecranon process and bones such as the radius and metacarpals. Measuring generally between in length, males of the species are slightly larger than females. They may attain an average weight of roughly for females and up to for males. Northern subspecies such as T. t. jeffersonii are heavier than the southern subspecies. In the fall, when food is plentiful, adult male badgers can reach up to .Lindzey, Fred (1994) \\"Badgers\\", Ch. 28 in The Handbook: Prevention and Control of Wildlife Damage.

In some northern populations, females can average . American badger Except for the head, the American badger is covered with a grizzled, brown, black and white coat of coarse hair or fur, giving almost a mixed brown-tan appearance. The coat aids in camouflage in grassland habitat. Its triangular face shows a distinctive black and white pattern, with brown or blackish \\"badges\\" marking the cheeks and a white stripe extending from the nose to the base of the head. In the subspecies T. t. berlandieri, the white head stripe extends the full length of the body, to the base of the tail. Diet American badger skull The American badger is a fossorial carnivore. It preys predominantly on pocket gophers (Geomyidae), ground squirrels (Spermophilus), moles (Talpidae), marmots (Marmota), prairie dogs (Cynomys), pika (Ochotona), woodrats (Neotoma), kangaroo rats (Dipodomys), deer mice (Peromyscus), and voles (Microtus), often digging to pursue prey into their dens, and sometimes plugging tunnel entrances with objects. The American badger is a significant predator of snakes including rattlesnakes, and is considered the most important predator of rattlesnakes in South Dakota.Klauber, Lawrence Monroe (1997). Rattlesnakes: Their Habits, Life Histories, and Influence on Mankind. Volume 1. 2nd ed. Berkeley (California): University of California Press. p. 1076. . They also prey on ground-nesting birds, such as the bank swallow or sand martin (Riparia riparia) and the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), lizards, amphibians, carrion, fish, skunks (Mephitis and Spilogale), insects (including bees and honeycomb), and some plant foods such as corn (Zea mais), peas, green beans, mushrooms and other fungi, and sunflower seeds (Helianthus). Behavior American badgers are generally nocturnal; however, in remote areas with no human encroachment they are routinely observed foraging during the day. Seasonally, a badger observed during daylight hours in the spring months of late March to early May often represents a female foraging during daylight and spending nights with her young. Badgers do not hibernate but may become less active in winter. A badger may spend much of the winter in cycles of torpor that last around 29 hours. They do emerge from their burrows when the temperature is above freezing. As a fossorial mammal, the American badger uses a scratch-digging process where the forelimbs are withdrawn to break the soil and move the debris behind or to the sides of its body An abandoned badger burrow may be occupied by mammals of similar size, such as foxes and skunks, as well as animals as diverse as the burrowing owl, California tiger salamander and California red-legged frog. The American badger has been seen working with a coyote in tandem while hunting. Typically this pairing is one badger to one coyote, however, one study found about 9% of sightings included two coyotes to one badger, while 1% had one badger to three coyotes. Researchers have found that the coyote benefits by an increased catch rate of about 33%, and while it is difficult to see precisely how the badger benefits, the badger has been noted to spend more time underground and active. Badgers are also thought to expend less energy while hunting in burrows. According to research, this partnership works due to the different hunting styles of the predators and how their prey reacts to them. A ground squirrel, upon spotting a coyote, will crawl into its hole to escape; while upon seeing a badger, the ground squirrel will climb out of its hole and use its speed to outrun the badger. Hunting in tandem raises the prey vulnerability and both predators win. Life cycle Badgers are normally solitary animals, but are thought to expand their territories in the breeding season to seek out mates. Mating occurs in late summer and early fall, with some males breeding with more than one female. American badgers experience delayed implantation, with pregnancies suspended until December or as late as February. Young are born from late March to early April in litters ranging from one to five young, averaging about three. Badgers are born blind, furred, and helpless. Eyes open at four to six weeks. The female feeds her young solid foods prior to complete weaning, and for a few weeks thereafter. Young American badgers first emerge from the den on their own at five to six weeks old. Families usually break up and juveniles disperse from the end of June to August; young American badgers leave their mothers as early as late May or June. Juvenile dispersal movements are erratic. American badger at Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo Most female American badgers become pregnant for the first time after they are a year old. A minority of females four to five months old ovulate and a few become pregnant. Males usually do not breed until their second year. Large predators occasionally kill American badgers. The average longevity in the wild is 9–10 years, with a record of 14;Lindsey, Frederick G. (1971). Ecology of badgers in Curlew Valley, Utah and Idaho with emphasis on movement and activity patterns. Logan, UT: Utah State University a captive example lived at least 15 years and five months. Habitat American badgers prefer grasslands and open areas with grasslands, which can include parklands, farms, and treeless areas with friable soil and a supply of rodent prey.Banfield, A. W. F. (1974). The mammals of Canada. Toronto, ON: University of Toronto Pressde Vos, A. (1969). \\"Ecological conditions affecting the production of wild herbivorous mammals on grasslands\\", pp. 137–179 in Advances in ecological research. On file at U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Intermountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory, Missoula, MT They may also be found in forest glades and meadows, marshes, brushy areas, hot deserts, and mountain meadows. They are sometimes found at elevations up to but are usually found in the Sonoran and Transition life zones (which are at elevations lower and warmer than those characterized by coniferous forests). In Arizona, they occur in desert scrub and semidesert grasslands.Davis, Russell; Sidner, Ronnie. (1992). Mammals of woodland and forest habitats in the Rincon Mountains of Saguaro National Monument, Arizona. Technical Report NPS/WRUA/NRTR-92/06. Tucson, AZ: The University of Arizona, School of Renewable Natural Resources, Cooperative National Park esources Study Unit In California, American badgers are primarily able to survive through a combination of open grasslands of agricultural lands, protected land trust and open space lands, and regional and state and national park lands with grassland habitat. The Sonoma County badger population includes some protected and private lands near the Sonoma Coast, as well as one in South Sonoma County fragilely surviving in spite of abundant prey due to fragmentation. Badgers are occasionally found in open chaparral (with less than 50% plant cover) and riparian zones. They are not usually found in mature chaparral.Quinn, Ronald D. (1990). \\"Habitat preferences and distribution of mammals in California chaparral\\". Res. Pap. PSW-202. Berkeley, CA: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Research Station In Manitoba aspen parklands, American badger abundance was positively associated with the abundance of Richardson's ground squirrels (Spermophilus richardsonii). In Ontario it primarily resides on the extreme southwestern portion of the province, restricted to the north shore of Lake Erie in open areas generally associated with agriculture and along woodland edges. There have been a few reports from the Bruce-Grey region. Badgers can be found in the sagebrush deserts of eastern Oregon American badger use of home range varies with season and sex. Different areas of the home range are used more frequently at different seasons and usually are related to prey availability. Males generally have larger home ranges than females. In a 1972 study, radiotransmitter-tagged American badgers had an average annual home range of . The home range of one female was in summer, in fall, and in winter. Lindzey reported average home ranges of . Estimated density of American badgers in Utah scrub-steppe was one per square mile (2.6 km2), with 10 dens in active or recent use. , overdevelopment of American Badger habitat had resulted in reduced range, decreased prey, and forced badgers into contact with humans when foraging between fragments. Direct observations in Sonoma County, documenting habitat and badger sightings and foraging, reflect various ranges within the fragmented habitat areas from less than 1/2 mile to approximately 4 miles. Within these areas, the availability of prey and a fresh water source are key factors for the preferred habitat areas and ability to survive. Identifying and conserving habitat areas where there is year-round activity, along with identified burrowing patterns and observations of female badger territory for birthing and raising young have become critical factors in survival of the species. Plant communities American badgers are most commonly found in treeless areas, including tallgrass and shortgrass prairies, grass-dominated meadows and fields within forested habitats, and shrub-steppe communities. In the Southwest, plant indicators of the Sonoran and Transition life zones (relatively low, dry elevations) commonly associated with American badgers include creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), junipers (Juniperus spp.), gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), willows (Salix spp.), cottonwoods (Populus spp.), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), grasses, and sagebrushes (Artemisia spp.). In Colorado in 1977, American badgers were common in grass–forb and ponderosa pine habitats.Morris, Meredith J.; Reid, Vincent H.; Pillmore, Richard E.; Hammer, Mary C. (1977). \\"Birds and mammals of Manitou Experimental Forest, Colorado\\". Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-38. Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment. In Kansas, they are common in tallgrass prairie dominated by big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans). In Montana 24 years ago, badgers were present in Glacier National Park in fescue (Festuca spp.) grasslands.Tyser, Robin W. (1990). \\"Ecology of fescue grasslands in Glacier National Park\\", pp. 59–60 in Boyce, Mark S.; Plumb, Glenn E. (eds.) National Park Service Research Center, 14th annual report. Laramie, WY: University of Wyoming, National Park Service Research Center. In Manitoba, they occur in grassland extensions within aspen (Populus spp.) parklands. Cover requirements American badgers require cover for sleep, concealment, protection from weather, and natal denning. They typically enlarge foraged out gopher or other prey holes, or other animal burrows. Their dens range from about 4 feet to 10 feet in depth and 4 feet to 6 feet in width. A female American Badger may create 2 to 4 burrows in proximity with a connecting tunnel for concealment and safety for her young. Displaced soil from digging out the burrow characteristically appears in front of the burrow entrance, and a view from a distance reveals a mound-like roof of the burrow, with the living and concealment space created underneath the raised-roof appearing mound. During summer and autumn, badgers range more frequently, with mating season generally in November, and burrowing patterns reflect 1 to 3 burrows may be dug from foraged out prey holes in a day, used for a day to a week, and then abandoned, with possible returns later, and other small wildlife utilizing abandoned burrows in the interim. Where prey is particularly plentiful, they will reuse dens,Long, Charles A.; Killingley, Carl Arthur. (1983). The badgers of the world. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishing especially in the fall, sometimes for a few days at a time. In winter, a single den may be used for most of the season. Natal dens are dug by the female and are used for extended periods, but litters may be moved, probably to allow the mother to forage in new areas close to the nursery. Natal dens are usually larger and more complex than diurnal dens. Predation While the American badger is an aggressive animal with few natural enemies, it is still vulnerable to other species in its habitat. Predation on smaller individuals by golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), coyotes and bobcats (Lynx rufus) have been reported. Bears (Ursus spp.) and gray wolves (Canis lupus) occasionally kill American badgers,Lindzey, Frederick G. (1982). \\"Badger: Taxidea taxus\\", pp. 653–663 in Chapman, Joseph A.; Feldhamer, George A., eds. Wild mammals of North America: Biology, management, and economics. Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press. . while cougars (Puma concolor), according to a 2019 study, apparently are the main predators of adults, hunting them much more frequently than the other carnivorans, with a documented case where the badger is one of the main prey of a collared cat. American badgers are trapped by humans for their pelts. Their fur is used for shaving and painting brushes. Conservation status In May 2000, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed both the Taxidea taxus jacksoni and the T. t. jeffersonii subspecies as an endangered species in Canada. The California Department of Fish and Game designated the American badger as a California species of special concern.

Caps are worn for various reasons. Swim caps are sometimes worn in an attempt to keep hair relatively dry or protect from chlorinated water, to keep the sun off the hair, and when a cap is worn with earplugs, to keep water out of the ears. History Young girls from a Montreal kindergarten wearing swimsuits and swim caps, 1943 Swim caps were made of rubberized fabric during the early 20th century. By the 1920s they were made of latex. The earliest chin strap caps were known as \\"aviator's style caps\\" as they resembled the strapped leather helmets of flyers of the day. During the 1940s swim caps became scarce as rubber was needed for war materials. The permanent wave hairstyle took time to obtain and was expensive, so many women wanted to protect their hair while swimming. The 1950s saw decorated caps come into vogue, and during the 1960s colorful flower petal swim caps became popular. Men's long hair styles of the late 1960s and early 1970s gave rise to increased use of swim caps. Without swim cap requirements wearing swim caps fell out of fashion during the 1970s. Swim caps are available in different styles, traditional chin strap type with inner sealing to keep out water and colourful floral styles reminiscent of the 1960s as well as other graphic prints. Double swim caps Many swimmers have trouble finding a swim cap that keeps their hair dry. \\"Double capping\\"—wearing two swim caps—can provide a tighter swim cap seal. An inner silicone or latex swim cap pulled low over the ears worn under a second traditional style chin strap swim cap with an inner seal may provide the protection desired. \\"Double capping\\" is also used by participants of open water swimming to provide warmth. In order to make as smooth a surface as possible for maximum streamlining, sometimes an inner latex cap is put on, followed by swim goggles over the latex cap, and then second snug silicone swim cap is fitted over both. Swim caps are worn to keep hair out of swimmers faces when swimming. It can also be used to keep hair dry when swimming too.  English Channel swimming rules for swim caps  The English \\"Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation\\" and the \\"Channel Swimming Association\\" state that \\"one standard swim cap\\" may be used for official English Channel record swims. The cap must be approved by the official observer who accompanies the swimmer on the pilot boat across the channel. \\"Standard swim caps\\" that have been used by English Channel swimmers of record over the years include solid rubber \\"tank\\" style swim caps, molded rubber swim caps with chin strap, bubble crepe rubber swim caps with chin strap, silicone swim caps and latex \\"racing\\" swim caps. Swim caps that have neoprene within the cap construction such as the \\"Barracuda Hothead\\", or that are completely made of neoprene are not allowed for record English Channel swims. Several other long distance swims such as the Santa Catalina Channel California swim have similar rules for record swims. Swim caps worn for open water swims should be of visible colors that contrast with the water so that observers may safely monitor them, and operators of vessels may see them. Many swimmer will wear a swim cap to keep hair out of their faces when swimming in a race.

The Z1 is unique for its plastic body panels and vertically sliding doors which drop into the door sills. It is one of the first BMWs to use a multi-link rear suspension. The sole drivetrain specification is the 2.5-litre straight-six engine and 5-speed manual transmission from the E30 325i. In 1996, the Z1's successor, the mass-produced Z3, began production.  Development and launch  At the start of 1985, BMW set up a division called BMW Technik GmbH to develop concepts for new vehicles and technologies. The director of BMW Technik GmbH was Ulrich Bez, who oversaw the Z1's development. Control of the project was turned over to Klaus Faust when Bez left BMW in October 1988. The lead designer was Harm Lagaay. In August 1985, the BMW board gave approval to further develop the BMW Technik's first concept vehicle, the Z1. A year later, the first road-going prototype was produced and BMW publicly revealed the project. A coupe model was also the subject of a design study, but it did not reach production. In early 1987, BMW announced that the Z1 would enter production and in September 1987, the production form of the Z1 was unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show. Production began in October 1988. The original price target was DM 80,000, however by the time production began, the base price had increased to DM 83,000.  Doors  The doors are unique in that they retract vertically, instead of traditional designs which swing outward or upward (the first car with retractable doors was the 1954 Kaiser Darrin, although those Kaiser Darrin doors slid forwards not downwards). The body with its high sills, offers crash protection independent of the doors, and it is possible (although perhaps not legal in some countries) for the Z1 to be driven with the doors lowered. The windows may be operated independently of the doors, although they do retract automatically if the door is lowered. Both the window and door are driven by electric motors through toothed rubber belts and may be moved manually in an emergency.  Body  BMW Z1 In addition to the unique door design, the Z1 body featured several other innovations: removable plastic body panels, a flat undertray, a roll-hoop integrated into the windscreen surround and continuously zinc welded seams. The side panels and doors are made of GE's Xenoy thermoplastic. The bonnet, boot, and roof cover are GRP components made by Seger + Hoffman AG. The car is painted in a special flexible lacquer finish developed jointly by AKZO Coatings and BMW Technik GmbH. During the Z1s launch, BMW suggested that owners purchase an additional set of body panels and change the color of the car from time to time. The car could actually be driven with all of the panels completely removed, similar to the Pontiac Fiero. BMW noted that the body could be completely replaced in 40 minutes, although Z1 owners have reported that this may be highly optimistic. Aerodynamics were a focus of the vehicle design. The flat plastic undertray is used for ground effect aerodynamics and the rear bumper - in conjunction with the aerodynamically shaped muffler - forms a diffuser to reduce rear lift. The front end reportedly induces a high-pressure zone just forward of the front wheels to increase front-wheel traction. The Z1 has a drag coefficient of 0.36 Cd with the top up or 0.43 Cd with it down.  Suspension  The rear suspension, called the Z Axle, was specially designed for the Z1. It was one of the first BMWs to feature a multi-link design. In the 1990s, the Z Axle would be used on a variety of BMW Group vehicles, including the E36 3 Series and the R40 Rover 75. Front suspension is as per the E30 325i. Wheels, similar to the E30 325i, are by wheels on both the front and rear, equipped with 205/55VR-15 tires.  Drivetrain  The sole drivetrain configuration is a 2.5 Litre M20) straight-six engine and five- speed Getrag 260/5 manual transmission, sourced from the E30 325i. The engine is a SOHC straight-six engine, which produces at 5,800 rpm and of torque. The engine sits tilted 20 degrees to the right, to accommodate the low hoodline.  Z Series  The \\"Z\\" in Z1 originally stood for , the German word for future. Later cars in the Z Series are the Z3, Z4, and Z8, which were all available as 2-seat convertibles (however some models were also available as 2-seat coupes).  Production  Interior The Z1 was produced from March 1989 to June 1991, all at BMW's plant in Munich, Exactly 8,000 cars were produced. All the cars were left-hand drive, and the majority (6,443) were sold in BMW's native German market. The country to receive the second-greatest number of Z1s, Italy, received less than 7% of the total sold domestically. BMW Z1 vehicles officially imported to France for sale there have yellow headlights instead of the clear ones found elsewhere. Initial demand was strong, with BMW receiving orders for 3,500 vehicles before production began. However, demand dropped significantly around 1988 and BMW ended production in 1991. There is speculation that the drop in demand was due to the early inflated demand from speculative investors. In 1988, however, BMW was quoted as saying that they had 35,000 orders for the Z1. BMW was reportedly unable to build more than 10 to 20 Z1 vehicles each day. More than half of all Z1 vehicles (specifically, 4,091) were produced for the 1990 model year. Seventy-eight Z1 vehicles were reportedly used as test mules, although most were later sold without a warranty and, presumably, at a lower price. None of the Z1 vehicles were sold with air conditioning. The vehicle's dashboard is very small and there was no room for both heat and cooling units. The Z1 was available in six exterior colours and four interior colours. Red is the most common exterior color. Most (6,177) were red, black, or green with a dark grey interior. Light yellow exterior (fun-gelb in German or fun yellow in English; 133 examples made) or red interior (38 examples made) are the rarest Z1 colours. The colours swimming pool blue and oh-so-orange were reserved for the car's designers, Ulrich Bez and Harm Lagaay.  Film and television appearances  The Z1 was featured in an episode of Wheeler Dealers in 2014. They bought the car as a non-standard yellow and returned the car back to a red colour. It was observed that BMW claimed the removable panels could be removed in 40 minutes; however it actually took six hours. The BMW Z1 also had a very small part in the Jackie Chan film, Armour of God II: Operation Condor.

Kaukonen performed with Jefferson Airplane and still performs regularly on tour with Hot Tuna, which started as a side project with bassist Jack Casady, and as of early 2019 has continued for 50 years. Rolling Stone magazine ranked him #54 on its list of 100 Greatest Guitarists. Biography Jorma Kaukonen was born in Washington, D.C. to Beatrice Love (née Levine) and Jorma Ludwik Kaukonen, Sr. He had Finnish paternal grandparents and Russian Jewish ancestry on his mother's side. He is the older brother of Peter Kaukonen. During his childhood, Jorma's family lived in Pakistan, the Philippines and other locales as he followed his father's State Department career from assignment to assignment before returning to the place of his birth. As a teenager in Washington, he and friend Jack Casady formed a band called The Triumphs, with Kaukonen on rhythm guitar and Casady on lead. Kaukonen departed Washington for studies at Antioch College, where friend Ian Buchanan taught him fingerstyle guitar playing. Buchanan also introduced Kaukonen to the music of Reverend Gary Davis, whose songs have remained important parts of Kaukonen's repertoire throughout his career.Tamarkin, Jeff. Got a Revolution!: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane. New York: Atria Books, 2005, p. 29. In 1962, Kaukonen moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and enrolled at the University of Santa Clara. During this time, he gave guitar lessons at Benner Music Company in San Jose. He played as a solo act in coffee houses and accompanied Janis Joplin on acoustic guitar on the historic 1964 recording known as \\"The Typewriter Tapes\\" because of the obtrusive sound of Kaukonen's first wife, Margareta, typing in the background.Tamarkin, p. 31 Jefferson Airplane In 1965, friend and former Santa Clara classmate Paul Kantner invited Kaukonen to join a rock band he was forming with Marty Balin. As a self-described country blues purist, Kaukonen was initially reluctant, but found his imagination excited by the arsenal of effects available to electric guitar, later remarking that he was \\"sucked in by technology.\\" With the group still looking for a name, Kaukonen suggested the name Jefferson Airplane, inspired by an eccentric friend who had given his dog the name \\"Blind Lemon Jefferson Airplane.\\" When their original bass player was fired, Kaukonen recommended his friend Jack Casady (who still lived in Washington at the time) as a replacement. Though never a prolific singer or songwriter during his Airplane tenure, Kaukonen contributed notable material to each of the group's albums, including the instrumental \\"Embryonic Journey\\"; arrangements of the traditional \\"Good Shepherd\\" and B.B. King's \\"Rock Me Baby\\"; \\"Third Week in the Chelsea,\\" which detailed his feelings about the disintegration of the band; and \\"Trial by Fire\\"--all of which he continues to play. Hot Tuna Hot Tuna at MerleFest, 2006. Left to right: Jack Casady, Jorma Kaukonen, and Barry Mitterhoff In 1969–70, Kaukonen and Jack Casady formed Hot Tuna, a spinoff group that allowed them to play as long as they liked. An early incarnation of Hot Tuna included Jefferson Airplane vocalist Marty Balin, Kaukonen's brother Peter on rhythm guitar and Joey Covington on drums and vocals. This grouping (which came to include guitarist Paul Ziegler after the younger Kaukonen's departure) came to an end after an unsuccessful recording jaunt in Jamaica, the sessions of which have never been released. A concurrent semi-acoustic configuration (including Kaukonen, Casady on electric bass and harmonica player Will Scarlett) enabled the guitarist to show off his Piedmont-style acoustic blues fingerpicking skills. The group's self-titled first album was a September 1969 live recording of this ensemble. Amid the gradual dissolution of Jefferson Airplane from 1971 to 1973, Hot Tuna went electric in earnest, with Airplane fiddler Papa John Creach joining for the next two albums. Hot Tuna scored an FM radio hit with \\"Ja Da (Keep on Truckin')\\" from their third (and first studio) album, Burgers. At this time, Kaukonen's songwriting began to dominate, as further evidenced by the next album, The Phosphorescent Rat, which featured only one cover song. Beginning with their fifth album, America's Choice (1974), the addition of drummer Bob Steeler encouraged a rise in volume and a change of band personality —a rampaging, Cream-like rock with often quasimystical lyrics by Kaukonen. During this period, the power trio was known for its very long live sets and instrumental jamming. Hot Tuna toured vigorously throughout the 1970s in both the United States and Europe, but with Hot Tuna's break up in 1978, the first phase of the band's career ended. Casady left to form the new wave band SVT, while Kaukonen played as a solo act at venues that had been booked for Hot Tuna's cancelled 1978 tour. Solo Kaukonen began his solo career several years prior to the breakup, when he recorded the 1974 album Quah. Produced by Jack Casady, Quah featured string overdubs on some tracks, as well as several tracks written and sung by Kaukonen's friend Tom Hobson. The opening track \\"Genesis\\" is featured in the films Margot at the Wedding (2007) and Transcendence (2014). The album's cover is on display at Donkey Coffee and Espresso, a coffee shop in Athens, Ohio. In 1979, Kaukonen released his second solo album, Jorma. Later that year, he began touring with a number of bass/drum combinations (first known as \\"Hidden Klitz\\", then as \\"White Gland\\", and finally as \\"Vital Parts\\"), which initially included Hot Tuna drummer Bob Steeler. During this time, he experimented with a new image, with short, dyed hair and extensive tattoos adorning his body, back, and arms. He recorded the album Barbeque King which was released in 1980. Kaukonen's traditional fan base did not warm to this new, perceived to be \\"punk\\" image, and sales of the album were so disappointing that Jorma was soon dropped from RCA Records. He continued playing as a solo artist throughout the 1980s at such venues as The Chestnut Cabaret in Philadelphia, The Capitol Theater in Passaic, New Jersey, and in Port Chester, New York. As in his Hot Tuna days, he played very long sets, usually beginning with an hour-long acoustic set followed by a long intermission and then a two-hour electric set, sometimes accompanied by bass and drums. Having briefly reformed for a tour in 1983 that closed with a farewell show at Jonathan Swift's in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 12/30/1983, Hot Tuna again reformed in 1986. At a 1988 Hot Tuna performance at The Fillmore, Kaukonen surprised fellow Airplane alumnus Paul Kantner, who was sitting in, with a surprise appearance by his estranged lover Grace Slick; the success of this performance helped to pave the way for a Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and record in 1989. In 1984, Kaukonen appeared on Robert Hunter's Amagamalin Street. This was the third album released by Relix Records, a label, founded by Les Kippel, that specialized in bands from the San Francisco Bay Area. Relix also released Splashdown, featuring a rare performance by Hot Tuna on WQIV, a now-defunct radio station in New York. Kippel was instrumental in reuniting Kaukonen and Casady in 1985 for a Hot Tuna theater tour. Relix Records remained Hot Tuna's record label until 2000, and also released Classic Hot Tuna Acoustic, Classic Hot Tuna Electric, Live at Sweetwater, and Live at Sweetwater Two. In 1985, Kaukonen performed with the band There Goes the Neighborhood with Jaco Pastorius (bass), Doug McClean (harmonica), Whitie Melvin (percussion), Ben Prevo (guitar), and Rashied Ali (congas). In 1993, he collaborated with ex-Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten in recording numerous arrangements of \\"Embryonic Journey.\\" The resulting tracks were released as Embryonic Journey, the album, in 1994 on the Relix label. In 1999, he played several gigs with Phil Lesh and Friends. In 2000, he appeared with jam band Widespread Panic during their summer tour. His 2002 album Blue Country Heart was nominated for a Grammy Award. With his wife Vanessa, Kaukonen currently owns and operates the Fur Peace Ranch, a music and guitar camp in the hills of southeast Ohio, north of Pomeroy, complete with a 32 track studio.Berkowitz, Kenny. \\"Full Circle: Rock Star Jorma Kaukonen Revisits his Youth with a Rootsy Collection of Early Classics.\\" Acoustic Guitar.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 16, 1997. In the episode, Homer dissociates himself from new family friend John after discovering that he is gay. Homer fears that John will have a negative influence on his son Bart and decides to ensure Bart's heterosexuality by taking him hunting. It was the first episode written by Ron Hauge and was directed by Mike B. Anderson. George Meyer pitched \\"Bart the homo\\" as an initial idea for an episode while show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were planning an episode involving Lisa \\"discovering the joys of campy things\\". Oakley and Weinstein combined the two ideas and they eventually became \\"Homer's Phobia\\". Fox censors originally found the episode unsuitable for broadcast because of its controversial subject matter, but this decision was reversed after a turnover in the Fox staff. Filmmaker John Waters guest-starred, providing the voice of the new character, John. \\"Homer's Phobia\\" was the show's first episode to revolve entirely around gay themes and received a positive critical response both for its humor and anti-homophobia message. It won four awards, including an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or Less) and a GLAAD Media Award for \\"Outstanding TV – Individual Episode\\". Plot The Simpsons need money to pay for a $900 repair after Bart damages the gas line. Marge tries to sell a family heirloom -- an \\"authentic\\" American Civil War doll -- to Cockamamie's, a campy collectibles shop. Marge is disappointed when John, the shop owner, reveals her precious heirloom is a cheap liquor bottle of little value. Marge, Homer, Bart and Lisa take an instant liking to John, who is invited to the Simpsons' house to see campy items that the family owns. The next morning, Homer tells Marge that he likes John and suggests they invite him and \\"his wife\\" over some time. When Marge informs Homer that John is gay, he is horrified. Homer's attitude towards John changes completely and he refuses to join the tour of Springfield that John has arranged. The rest of the family joins John for the tour and enjoy his company. Bart starts wearing Hawaiian shirts and dancing in a woman's wig, which makes Homer suspect that Bart is gay. Hoping to ensure Bart likes girls, Homer forces him to stare at a cigarette billboard featuring scantily clad women. This backfires when Bart craves slim cigarettes, considered effeminate because they are marketed to women. Homer takes Bart to a steel mill to revel in a manly environment; however, the entire workforce is gay, which Homer learns when the steel mill turns into a gay disco during breaks. Desperate, Homer takes Bart deer hunting with Moe and Barney. When they cannot find any deer, they decide to shoot reindeer at Santa's Village instead. The reindeer violently attack the hunters, who drop their macho posturing because of genuine fear. With help from Lisa and Marge, John uses a Japanese Santa Claus robot to scare away the reindeer and save the hunting party. Homer is grateful to John for saving their lives and grudgingly accepts him. As John drives everyone home, Homer tells Bart he is fine with however he chooses to live his life. Bart is confused until Lisa explains Homer thinks his son is gay. Bart is stunned as their car drives away blaring a gay anthem. Production John Waters instantly accepted the invitation to guest-star in the episode. The original concept for the episode came from a few lines of show ideas written by George Meyer. One of them read \\"Bart the homo\\", and Ron Hauge was selected to write the episode, with the story stemming from that line. The idea of using filmmaker John Waters as a guest star had been around for a while. Many of the staff were fans of his work, and showrunners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein had planned to use him in an episode called \\"Lisa and Camp\\", which revolved around Lisa \\"discovering the joys of campy things\\". Their idea was combined with Meyer's and it became this episode. The episode was originally titled \\"Bart Goes to Camp\\", but was renamed because the joke was too oblique. Mike B. Anderson directed the episode, telling The Gold Coast Bulletin: \\"When I read the script I was enthralled, not only because of the visual possibilities, but also because the story felt very solid. It was engaging and surprising and I really put heart into that episode.\\" Waters accepted his invitation to be a guest star instantly, stating that if it was good enough for the actress Elizabeth Taylor, who appeared in the season four episodes \\"Lisa's First Word\\" and \\"Krusty Gets Kancelled\\", it was good enough for him. He joked, however, about a negative reaction if his character would be made to look like fitness personality Richard Simmons. John's design was based largely on Waters' own appearance; for animation reasons, Waters moustache was changed from straight to curvy, so that it did not look like a mistake. As thanks for his performance, the show's staff sent Waters an animation cel from the episode, which he now has hanging in his office. According to Oakley, the Fox censor objected to \\"Homer's Phobia\\" being aired. The normal procedure is for an episode's script to be sent to the censor and then faxed back with a list of lines and words that should be substituted. However, this episode came back with two pages of notes about almost every single line in the show. The censors stated that they did not like the use of the word \\"gay\\", or the discussion of homosexuality at all, and closed with a paragraph that stated that \\"the topic and substance of this episode are unacceptable for broadcast\\". Usually the censor notes are ignored as the offending lines and problems are dealt with after the episode has been animated. In this case, the entire episode was deemed a problem, so it could not be solved in this way. The staff asked Waters if he thought the gay community would find the episode offensive. Homer's use of the word \\"fag\\" to insult John was his only problem, so the writers changed it to \\"queer\\". The censor problems ultimately came to nothing as when the episode came back from animation in South Korea, the then-Fox president had just been fired and replaced, with the censors being replaced as well. The new censors sent back merely one line: \\"acceptable for broadcast\\". The \\"gay steel mill\\" scene was written by Steve Tompkins. He first pitched that Homer and Bart would encounter longshoremen, but it was too much work to animate the lading of ships, so a steel mill was used instead. Tompkins also wrote a different third act for the episode, which was never produced. Instead of Homer, Bart, Barney, and Moe going deer hunting and ending up at \\"Santa's Village\\" they would go back to the steel mill. There, Homer would attempt to prove his heterosexuality by having a human tractor pulling contest with some of the steel mill workers. It was decided that it \\"didn't really service the story\\" and was dropped. Cultural references The episode features numerous cultural references. The song \\"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)\\" by C+C Music Factory is played twice during the episode: first as the steel mill transforms into a disco, and second over the alternate closing credits. Homer's record collection includes music by The New Christy Minstrels and The Wedding of Lynda Bird Johnson, the albums Loony Luau and Ballad of the Green Berets by Staff Sgt. Barry Sadler. The song that John picks out and he and Homer dance to is \\"I Love the Nightlife\\" by Alicia Bridges, and the song that Bart dances to is \\"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)\\" by Betty Everett. When John is introduced, there is a plastic pink flamingo lying in the background, a reference to John Waters's film Pink Flamingos. Items in John's store include several buttons endorsing political campaigns of Richard Nixon, Dan Quayle, and Bob Dole as well as an issue of TV Guide owned by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis that features the title characters from the sitcom Laverne & Shirley on the cover. When John takes the Simpson family on a driving tour of Springfield's shopping district, he points out a store where he claims that the Mexican film actress Lupe Vélez bought the toilet she drowned in. This is a reference to the urban legend that Velez was found dead with her head in the toilet the night of her suicide in 1944.\\"Homer's Phobia\\" in The Simpsons Archive Reception=Ratings and awards Mike B. Anderson won two awards for directing the episode. In its original broadcast, \\"Homer's Phobia\\" finished tied for 47th place in the weekly ratings for the week of February 10–16, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 8.7. It was the fourth-highest-rated show on the Fox Network that week. The episode won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or Less) in 1997. Mike Anderson won the Annie Award for Best Individual Achievement: Directing in a TV Production, and the WAC Award for Best Director for Primetime Series at the 1998 World Animation Celebration. Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation called it \\"a shining example of how to bring intelligent, fair and funny representations of our community onto television\\" and awarded it the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding TV – Individual Episode. Several of the episode's animation cels were selected for display at the Silver K Gallery in Melbourne, Australia in 2001. Critical reviews and analysis \\"Homer's Phobia\\" has been cited as a significant part of The Simpsons exploration of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) themes. The series made several references to homosexuality before the episode aired.Raju Mudhar, \\"Springfield's coming-out party; Cartoon to reveal gay character And it might not be Smithers\\", Toronto Star, July 28, 2004, p. A.03. In the 1990 episode \\"Simpson and Delilah,\\" the character Karl (voiced by Harvey Fierstein) kisses Homer, while the recurring character Waylon Smithers is often shown to be in love with his boss, Montgomery Burns, initially suggestively and since then more overtly.Stephen Kiehl, \\"Homersexual debate splits Springfield\\", The Ottawa Citizen, February 12, 2005, p. L.7. However, \\"Homer's Phobia\\" was the first episode to revolve entirely around homosexual themes. Two later episodes that explored LGBT issues were \\"Three Gays of the Condo\\" and \\"There's Something About Marrying\\".\\"Springfield awaits its first outing\\", Calgary Herald, July 29, 2004, p. E.2. When the episode aired, the production team received \\"very few\\" complaints about its content, with most of the response being positive. Alan Frutkin gave the episode a positive write-up in the LGBT-interest magazine The Advocate, calling it \\"vintage Simpsons.\\" Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood stated in their book, I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, that: \\"Only The Simpsons could do this so tongue-in-cheek that nobody could get in a tizzy about it. Very good indeed.\\" In the book Leaving Springfield, Matthew Henry praised the episode's critiquing of \\"the most common misconception about homosexuality: namely that gayness is somehow contagious\\", as well as its other themes. Catharine Lumby of the University of Sydney cited the episode as an example of good satire as it \\"managed to explore a lot of [homosexual] issues in quite a deep way [...] without being overtly political\\", which she claimed, along with the episode's humor, made its anti-homophobia message more successful than that of other gay-themed shows like Queer as Folk. In his review of The Simpsons – The Complete Eighth Season DVD, Todd Gilchrist said that \\"Homer's Phobia\\" \\"certainly qualifies as one of the all-time greatest episodes\\". In 1998, TV Guide listed it in its list of top twelve Simpsons episodes. It was placed fifth on Entertainment Weeklys top 25 The Simpsons episode list. In 2003, USA Today published a top 10 episodes list chosen by the webmaster of The Simpsons Archive, which had this episode listed in tenth place, and it was again placed tenth on AskMen.com's \\"Top 10: Simpsons Episodes\\" list. IGN.com ranked John Waters's performance as the ninth-best guest appearance in the show's history, with TV Guide naming him the third-best film-related guest star. In a 2008 article, Entertainment Weekly named Waters as one of the 16 best The Simpsons guest stars. John Patterson of The Guardian wrote that Waters' appearance \\"felt to me like a summit meeting between the most influential pop-culture figures of the last 25 years\\". When The Simpsons began streaming on Disney+ in 2019, former Simpsons writer and executive producer Bill Oakley named this one of the best classic Simpsons episodes to watch on the service. Conversely, in 2002, Off the Telly writers Steve Williams and Ian Jones named \\"Homer's Phobia\\" one of the five worst episodes of The Simpsons, stating that it \\"leaves such a nasty taste in the mouth,\\" as Homer is \\"quite simply a bastard\\" throughout the course of the episode. The pair concluded by saying \\"this is a side of the show we'd not seen before, nor particularly wanted to see.\\" In June 2003, Igor Smykov sued the Russian television channel REN TV on claims that The Simpsons, along with Family Guy, were \\"morally degenerate and promoted drugs, violence and homosexuality\\". As evidence, \\"Homer's Phobia\\" was shown to the judge to prove that The Simpsons promoted homosexuality and thus should not be aired again on the channel. The case was thrown out after one day.

He was maestro di cappella of the prestigious St. Mark's Basilica at the end of the 16th century, and was an important figure in the development of Italian light secular music, especially the villanella. Life Details of his early life are unavailable; it is not even known where he was born. The first record of Donato is as a singer at St. Mark's in Venice in 1550, and he was given charge of the musical training of the boys there in 1562. When Gioseffo Zarlino took over the post of maestro di cappella from Cipriano de Rore in 1565, Donato was demoted back to being a singer; conflict between the two men seems to have been a feature of life at St. Mark's, culminating in a climactic fight in 1569, publicly and scandalously, during the Feast of St. Mark. In 1577 Donato took a position at the Scuola Grande di S Rocco, another Venetian church with an impressive musical tradition and substantial performing ensemble; however he failed to get along with his employers there as well, resigning by 1580. In 1588 he became assistant maestro di cappella at St. Mark's, while Zarlino was still alive (whether because of reconcilement or politics is not clear), and in 1590 he took over the post of his former antagonist, holding it until his death in 1603. Music and influence Donato represented a progressive trend in the Venetian school, which was already a progressive tradition compared to the other major contemporary Italian musical styles (especially as compared to the Roman School). The progressive trend in the Venetian school was represented by composers such as Donato, Giovanni Croce, and Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli; the conservative trend involved composers and theorists such as Zarlino, Cipriano de Rore, and Claudio Merulo, who tended to follow the Franco-Flemish style which was predominant almost everywhere else in Europe until after mid-century. Donato's sacred music is the most conservative portion of his output, usually using polyphony in the Palestrina style, but also using some of the grand polychoral effects of the Gabrielis. In spite of his evident disdain for Zarlino's conservatism, he clearly absorbed some of his style and teaching, as can be seen in his smooth mastery of counterpoint and Zarlinoesque use of dissonance, at least when he was deliberately composing in the Franco-Flemish style. Probably his greatest significance to music history is in the development of a light secular form known as the villanella, a lighter form of madrigal, of Neapolitan origin. Some of these pieces may have been intended for dancing, and they were evidently popular. They are similar to the French chanson, often have a memorable melody in the topmost part, contain vigorous cross-rhythms, and avoid the polyphonic and chromatic complexity of the mid-century madrigal. Donato also wrote madrigals in a more serious style, as well as psalm settings, motets, and ceremonial music.

He is the namesake of the William R. Allen Road in Toronto, Ontario. Background Born in Buckingham, Quebec (on the outskirts of Ottawa, Ontario), Allen was a graduate of St. Michael's College School, the University of Toronto, and Osgoode Hall Law School. During World War II, he enlisted with the Queen's York Rangers and attained the rank of Captain, serving overseas in Britain and Europe. After being called to the Ontario Bar in 1949, Allen was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1960. He married Marjorie Hornberger; together, they raised three children. His father, Robert Aloysius Allen, was an alderman and then a Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament representing Riverdale during the 1930s. Robert Allen was the first Liberal to be elected to the legislature from Riverdale since Confederation in 1867. Robert Allen's father-in-law, Randall McDonnell, was the mayor of Mayo, Quebec for 13 consecutive years. Politics In 1950, William Allen entered municipal politics with his election as an alderman on Toronto city council, representing Riverdale in Ward 1. He subsequently was elected by the City of Toronto to become the youngest Controller in Toronto history. He was a member of the first Metropolitan Toronto Council in 1952. In the 1955 Toronto municipal election, Allen was elected to the Toronto Board of Control and was re-elected in 1956, 1958, and 1960. In 1958 and 1960 he finished in the top two, of the four Controllers elected, enabling him to return to Metro Council. Metropolitan Toronto was created by the Province of Ontario in 1952 and comprised Toronto, North York, Scarborough, Etobicoke, York, and East York. While these municipalities continued to manage some local matters, Metropolitan Toronto assumed the responsibilities of more expensive programs, such as the TTC, police, and welfare. The municipality was presided over by a \\"super mayor\\", or Metro Chairman, for its 46-year duration until amalgamation in 1998. Undefeated in civic elections, Allen remained in municipal office until 1962 when, upon the retirement of Fred Gardiner (namesake of the Gardiner Expressway), Allen defeated the Reeve of North York, Norman Goodhead, to become the second Chairman of Metropolitan Toronto. At the time, many felt Allen's Catholicism would serve as a roadblock in the election. Allen continued to build the infrastructure that began with his predecessor, Metro's first Chairman, Fred Gardiner. Most notably, the Bloor-Danforth and University subway lines opened during Allen's tenure. Furthermore, Allen also initiated many social programs that included welfare assistance and old age homes. Allen cited the latter initiative as one of his proudest achievements. Metro's fourth chair, Paul V. Godfrey, told reporters after Allen's death 25 years later that he gave Metro its \\"human touch\\". (Toronto Star, October 1/85) Allen retired from the post in 1969. After leaving politics, he served as President and CEO to several corporations and sat on the Board of Directors for Molson, Air Canada, York University, the Toronto Stock Exchange, and others. Allen continued to practice law before being appointed President of the Canadian National Exhibition from 1979 to 1980. During his political career, Allen served on all City Council and Metropolitan Council Standing Committees. He also held positions with a number of external bodies. He was President of the Ontario Municipal Association, Honorary President of the Convention and Tourist Bureau of Metropolitan Toronto, and Honorary Vice-President of Boy Scouts of Canada. Allen maintained similar policies set out by his predecessor Fred Gardiner. Toronto was going through a period of change and he did little to impede this process. He did preside over the expansion of the subway network and continued with the expressway building program, which was cancelled after his exit from politics. Retirement Upon his retirement, the Spadina Expressway was renamed the William R. Allen Expressway (now the William R. Allen Road) in honour of Allen's distinguished civic service. The \\"Allen\\" runs from Kennard Avenue (Wilson Heights Boulevard link) in the north, to Eglinton Avenue West in the south. Allen strongly opposed amalgamation until his death in 1985.(Globe and Mail, October 1/85) He is buried at Mount Hope Catholic Cemetery.

History The earliest known use is a passage in Henry George's best known work, Progress and PovertyThe text on wikisource differs from versions available here and here . (1879). From book IV, chapter 2: > It is a well-provisioned ship, this on which we sail through space. If the > bread and beef above decks seem to grow scarce, we but open a hatch and > there is a new supply, of which before we never dreamed. And very great > command over the services of others comes to those who as the hatches are > opened are permitted to say, \\"This is mine!\\" George Orwell later paraphrases Henry George in The Road to Wigan Pier: > The world is a raft sailing through space with, potentially, plenty of > provisions for everybody; the idea that we must all cooperate and see to it > that everyone does his fair share of the work and gets his fair share of the > provisions seems so blatantly obvious that one would say that no one could > possibly fail to accept it unless he had some corrupt motive for clinging to > the present system. In 1965, Adlai Stevenson made a famous speech to the UN, in which he said: > We travel together, passengers on a little space ship, dependent on its > vulnerable reserves of air and soil; all committed for our safety to its > security and peace; preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work, > and, I will say, the love we give our fragile craft.

Also in 1966, Kenneth E. Boulding, who was influenced by reading Henry George,King, J. E. \\"Economic Exiles\\". Palgrave Macmillan, 2014 used the phrase in the title of an essay, The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth. Boulding described the past open economy of apparently illimitable resources, which he said he was tempted to call the \\"cowboy economy\\", and continued: \\"The closed economy of the future might similarly be called the 'spaceman' economy, in which the earth has become a single spaceship, without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution, and in which, therefore, man must find his place in a cyclical ecological system\\". (David Korten would take up the \\"cowboys in a spaceship\\" theme in his 1995 book When Corporations Rule the World.) The phrase was also popularized by Buckminster Fuller, who authored the 1968 book Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth. The quotation is from Section 8: The regenerative landscape . This quotation, referring to fossil fuels, reflects his approach: > ... we can make all of humanity successful through science's world-engulfing > industrial evolution provided that we are not so foolish as to continue to > exhaust in a split second of astronomical history the orderly energy savings > of billions of years' energy conservation aboard our Spaceship Earth. These > energy savings have been put into our Spaceship's life-regeneration- > guaranteeing bank account for use only in self-starter functions. United Nations Secretary-General U Thant spoke of Spaceship Earth on Earth Day March 21, 1971 at the ceremony of the ringing of the Japanese Peace Bell: \\"May there only be peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful Spaceship Earth as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.\\" Spaceship Earth is the name given to the diameter geodesic sphere that greets visitors at the entrance of Walt Disney World's Epcot theme park. Housed within the sphere is a dark ride that serves to explore the history of communications and promote Epcot's founding principles, \\"[a] belief and pride in man's ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere.\\" A previous incarnation of the ride, narrated by actor Jeremy Irons and revised in 2008, was explicit in its message: > Like a grand and miraculous spaceship, our planet has sailed through the > universe of time, and for a brief moment, we have been among its many > passengers... We now have the ability and the responsibility to build new > bridges of acceptance and co-operation between us, to create a better world > for ourselves and our children as we continue our amazing journey aboard > Spaceship Earth. The term \\"Spaceship Earth\\" is frequently used on the labels of Emanuel Bronner's products to emphasize and promote his belief in the unity of humankind.

Jones, attacked and ransacked Lawrence, Kansas, a town which had been founded by antislavery settlers from Massachusetts who were hoping to make Kansas a free state. The incident fueled the irregular conflict in Kansas Territory that later became known as Bleeding Kansas. The human cost of the attack was low: only one persona member of the proslavery gangwas killed, and his death was accidental. However, Jones and his men halted production of the Free-State newspapers the Kansas Free State and the Herald of Freedom (with the former ceasing publication altogether and the latter taking months to once again start up). The proslavery men also destroyed the Free State Hotel and Charles L. Robinson's house. Background Lawrence was founded in 1854 by antislavery settlers from Massachusetts, many of whom received financial support from the New England Emigrant Aid Company. The town soon became the epicenter of violence in Kansas Territory, as many proslavery settlers in the area loathed the free state citizens of the town (and vice versa). While the village had nearly been raided during the so- called Wakarusa War in December 1855, it was not directly attacked at that time. In regards to the Sacking of Lawrence, many abolitionists regarded the non-fatal shooting of Douglas County Sheriff Samuel J. Jones, who was attempting to arrest free-state settlers in Lawrence, as the immediate cause of the violence. Lawrence residents drove Jones out of town after they shot him, and on May 11, Federal Marshal Israel B. Donaldson proclaimed that the assassination attempt had interfered with the execution of warrants against the extralegal Free-State legislature, which was set up in opposition to the official proslavery territorial government. Donaldson's proclamation and the presentment by the first district of Kansas's grand jury that \\"the building known as the 'Free State' Hotel' in Lawrence had been constructed with a view to military occupation and defense , regularly parapeted and port holed, for the use of cannon and small arms, thereby endangering the public safety, and encouraging rebellion and sedition in this country\\" led to Sheriff Jones and Marshal Donaldson assembling an army of roughly 800 southern settlers. This group planned to enter Lawrence, disarm the citizens, destroy the antislavery newspaper presses, and level the Free State Hotel. Sack The \\"Old Sacramento\\" cannon captured by U.S. during the Mexican–American War in 1847 and taken to the Liberty Arsenal. The cannon was fired by proslavery forces during the Siege of Lawrence. On May 21, 1856, Jones and Donaldson neared the town. A large force was stationed on the high ground at Mount Oread, and a cannon was placed to cover and command the area. The house of Charles L. Robinson (later to become the first governor of Kansas) was taken over as Jones's headquarters. Every road to the town and on the opposite side of the river was guarded by Jones's men to prevent the free soilers from fleeing. A number of flags were flown by Jones's men, such as the state banners of Alabama and South Carolina, a flag with black and white stripes, and flags bearing proslavery and/or inflammatory inscriptions (i.e. \\"Kansas the Outpost\\", \\"Southern Rights\\", and \\"Supremacy of the White Race\\"). Shalor Eldridge, the proprietor of the Free State Hotel, soon learned of the oncoming forces, and he journeyed out to meet them; he was told by Donaldson that the posse would enter into Lawrence and attack if and only if the citizens tried to resist Donaldson and Jones's men. Donaldson and Eldridge then journeyed to the hotel, where, according to the New York Times, Eldridge had prepared \\"an elegant dinner, the best that the fresh and abundant stores in the cellar could afford\\" (which included \\"costly wines\\") so as to placate the marshal and his men. Eldridge was interviewed by Donaldson while the federal agent and his followers ravenously consumed the meal, then left without paying. Shortly afterwards, the marshal dismissed his followers, who were immediately deputized by Jones. Jones then asked to speak to a representative of the town. Samuel C. Pomeroy (who, along with Charles Robinson, had led the second group of settlers to the Lawrence city site in 1854) agreed to meet with the sheriff and discuss with him the situation at hand. Jones was clear in what he wanted: for the citizens of Lawrence to surrender all of their weapons. Pomeroy argued that there was not much he could do in this regard, as it was ultimately up to the individual citizens to give up their arms. However, hoping to encourage Jones to leave the city peacefully, Pomeroy agreed to turn over the city's only artillery piece. While Jones did seize this cannon, it did not appease the sheriff as Pomeroy had hoped. According to the Lawrence minister Richard Cordley: > As soon as Jones had possession of the cannon and other arms, he proceeded > to carry out his purpose to destroy the Free-State Hotel. He gave the > inmates till five o’clock to get out their personal effects. When all was > ready he turned [the posse's very own] cannon upon the hotel and fired. The > first ball went completely over the roof, at which all the people cheered, > much to the disgust of Jones. The next shot hit the walls but did little > damage. After bombarding away with little or no effect till it was becoming > monotonous, they attempted to blow up the building with a keg of powder. But > this only made a big noise and a big smoke, and did not do much towards > demolishing the house. At every failure the citizen spectators along the > street set up a shout. At last Jones became desperate, and applied the > vulgar torch, and burned the building to the ground. [...] Jones was > exultant. His revenge was complete. \\"This is the happiest moment of my > life,\\" he shouted as the walls of the hotel fell. He had made the \\"fanatics > bow to him in the dust.\\" He then dismissed his posse and left. It was the \\"Old Sacramento\\" cannon that the proslavery forces made use of in their initial attempt to bring down the Free State Hotel. This weapon had been stored at the Liberty Arsenal until it was seized by them in 1855. (The cannon would eventually be captured by free-staters later in 1856 during the Second Battle of Franklin.) While Jones and his men were trying to bring down the hotel, the printing offices of the Kansas Free State and the Herald of Freedom were trashed; their libraries were thrown out the window, the presses were smashed, the type was thrown in the river, and any remaining papers were either thrown into the blowing wind to be carried off or were used by Jones and his men to burn down the Free State Hotel. When the newspapers were obliterated and the hotel had been brought to the ground, Jones's men then looted the half-deserted town. As they retreated, they burned Robinson's home on Mount Oread for good measure. One person—a member of Jones's gang—died during the attack when he was struck in the head by a collapsing bit of the Free State Hotel. Aftermath While the Free State Hotel was destroyed, Shalor Eldridge purchased the charred remnants of the structure and rebuilt it as the \\"Eldridge House\\". This building remained a fixture of Lawrence until 1863, when it was burned down by William Quantrill during the Lawrence Massacre (after which it would be rebuilt two more times in 1866 and 1926, respectively). For a number of months after the Sack of Lawrence, the city was without a free state newspaper. This was exacerbated by the fact that Josiah Miller, who ran the Kansas Free State, decided not to start his former paper up again. The lack of a Lawrence-based news source ended when George Brown restarted the Herald of Freedom in November. The Sack of Lawrence resulted in the loss of the city's only cannon. This would be at least one reason that Free-Staters would attack Franklin's Fort in June and August of 1856, as they hoped to secure the \\"Old Sacramento\\" cannon for their own use.

History The authority was formed on 1 December 1995 (initially as the Provisional Airport Authority in 1990) through Airport Authority Ordinance and is independent of the government financially. There are plans to corporatise the AA and to list it on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and to partially sell it to the public. A convention and exhibition facility, the AsiaWorld-Expo, on the northeastern corner of the island of Chek Lap Kok was opened on 21 December 2005. On 17 January 2005, the AA acquired 49% stake of Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, with HK$ 1.99 billion, compared to bids by Singapore Changi Airport, Copenhagen Airport, Houston International Airport and BAA plc. A new holding company of Xiaoshan Airport will be formed and be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. On 17 February 2006, the AA confirmed it will hold 55% stake in a company that operates the Zhuhai Airport, with the remaining 45% owned by Zhuhai Airport. The company will not own the assets or the liabilities of the airport. In 2017, the Airport Authority approved a HKD $140 billion (US$18 billion) expansion for Hong Kong International Airport. Operations AAHK is headquartered at HKIA Tower, which is connected to the airport terminal. As of March 2019, the authority had 2,602 employees. CCTV controversy In March 2013 an airline passenger witnessed a suspected theft in the baggage reclaim hall of Chek Lap Kok Airport. He reported the theft to airport staff, who did nothing. The passenger then contacted the Airport Authority to enquire on the availability of CCTV footage of the incident. Airport Authority staff responded that the cameras were used only for real- time monitoring. Legislative councillor Alice Mak asked for clarification on behalf of the passenger. It was revealed that the CCTV system does have a recording function. The AAHK added that \\"the staff concerned, who were not honest in this instance, have been suitably admonished\\". The case was investigated by the Office of the Ombudsman, which released a report in January 2015. The report noted that the AAHK training material instructs staff to answer enquiries about CCTV with the response, \\"CCTVs are used for real time surveillance only\\", which is a lie. The Ombudsman alleged that \\"AA’s statement that the staff concerned were not honest was therefore grossly unfair\\" and that \\"we consider knowingly constructing a standard response which contains false information totally unacceptable.\\" The Ombudsman considered the complaint against AAHK substantiated and recommended the authority review its CCTV policies and procedures and provide customer service training that \\"would not compromise the honesty and transparency of AA.\\" The Airport Authority responded that the incident was isolated, and that it had implemented the recommendations made by the Ombudsman.

ARINC had installed computer data networks in police cars and railroad cars and also maintains the standards for line-replaceable units. ARINC was formerly headquartered in Annapolis, Maryland, and had two regional headquarters in London, established in 1999 to serve the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, and Singapore, established in 2003 for the Asia Pacific region. ARINC had more than 3,200 employees at over 120 locations worldwide. The sale of the company by Carlyle Group to Rockwell Collins was completed on December 23, 2013, and from November 2018 operating as part of Collins Aerospace. History ARINC was incorporated in 1929 as Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated. It was chartered by the Federal Radio Commission (which later became the Federal Communications Commission) in order to serve as the airline industry's single licensee and coordinator of radio communication outside of the government. The corporation's stock was held by four major airlines of the day. Through most of its history, ARINC was owned by airlines and other aviation-related companies such as Boeing until the sale to The Carlyle Group in October 2007. Not much later ARINC took on the responsibility for all ground-based, aeronautical radio stations and for ensuring station compliance with Federal Radio Commission (FRC) rules and regulations. Using this as a base technology, ARINC expanded its contributions to transport communications as well as continuing to support the commercial aviation industry and U.S. military. ARINC also developed the standards for the trays and boxes used to hold standard line-replaceable units (like radios) in aircraft. This subsequently allowed electronics to be rapidly replaced without complex fasteners or test equipment. In 1978 ARINC introduced ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System), a datalink system that enables ground stations (airports, aircraft maintenance bases, etc.) to upload data (such as flight plans) and download data (such as fuel quantity, weight on wheels, flight management system (FMS) data), via an onboard Communications Management Unit (CMU). ARINC has expanded its business in aerospace and defense through its ARINC Engineering Services subsidiary. With the sale of the company to Rockwell Collins, the ARINC Engineering Services subsidiary split into Commercial Aerospace and Defense Services. The Defense Services branch was then purchased by Booz Allen Hamilton, remaining part of the Carlyle group. The sale of a Standards Development Organization (SDP) to a corporate sponsor raised concerns of conflict of interest and resulted in the sale of the ARINC Industry Activities (IA) Division to SAE International in January 2014. It now operates under the SAE Industry Technologies Consortia (SAE ITC).https://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2013/12/24/arincs-new- owner-to-sell-off-two.html United Technologies completed its acquisition of Rockwell Collins in November 2018 and merged it with its UTC Aerospace Systems to form Collins Aerospace.

New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. He occupied the fifth chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters from 1912 until his death in 1917. Early years Oswaldo Gonçalves Cruz was born on August 5, 1872 in São Luis do Paraitinga, a small city in São Paulo Province, to the physician Bento Gonçalvez Cruz and Amália Bulhões Cruz. As a child, he moved to Rio de Janeiro with his family. At the age of 15 he started to study at the Faculty of Medicine of Rio de Janeiro and in 1892 he graduated as medical doctor with a thesis on water as vehicle for the propagation of microbes. Inspired by the great work of Louis Pasteur, who had developed the germ theory of disease, four years later he went to Paris to specialize in bacteriology at the Pasteur Institute, which gathered the great names of this branch of science of that time. He was financed by his father- in-law, a wealthy Portuguese merchant. Career=Work in Brazil Cruz found the seaport of Santos ravaged by an epidemic of bubonic plague that threatened to reach Rio de Janeiro and engaged himself immediately in the combat of this disease. The mayor of Rio de Janeiro authorized the construction of a plant for manufacturing the serum against the disease which had been developed at the Pasteur Institute by Alexandre Yersin and coworkers. He asked the institution for a scientist who could bring to Brazil this know- how. The Pasteur Institute responded that such a person was already available in Brazil: Dr. Oswaldo Cruz. On May 25, 1900, the Federal Serum Therapy Institute destined to the production of sera and vaccines against the bubonic plague was created with Baron Pedro Afonso as director general and the young bacteriologist Oswaldo Cruz as technical director. The new institute was established in the old farm of Manguinhos at the western shores of Guanabara Bay. In 1902, Cruz accepted the office of director general of the institute and soon expanded the scope of its activities, now no longer restricted to the production of sera but also dedicated to basic and applied research and to the building of human resources. In the following year, Cruz was appointed director general of Public Health, a position corresponding to today's Brazilian Minister of Health. Using the Federal Serum Therapy Institute as technical-scientific base, he embarked in quick succession of important sanitation campaigns. His first challenge was a series of yellow fever endemics, which had earned Rio de Janeiro the sinister reputation of 'Foreigners' Grave'. Between 1897 and 1906, 4,000 European immigrants had died there from the disease. Cruz pursued the new technique of eradicating mosquitoes and their breeding grounds, fumigating houses, and isolation of the ill. There was opposition to the campaign by many, including physicians, the military, and the poor, but the campaign was successful. Cruz was initially successful in the sanitary campaign against the bubonic plague, to which end he used obligatory notification of cases, isolation of sick people, treatment with the sera produced at Manguinhos and extermination of the rats populating the city. Smallpox vaccination controversy He was not successful in implementing a widespread vaccination against smallpox, due to popular resistance to it.Stepan, \\"Cruz\\", p. 303. In 1904, a smallpox epidemic was threatening the capital. In the first five months of the year, more than 1,800 people had been hospitalized. A law imposing smallpox vaccination of children had existed since 1837 but had never been put into practice. Therefore, on June 9, 1904, following a proposal by Oswaldo Cruz, the government presented a bill to the Congress requesting the reestablishment of obligatory smallpox vaccination. The extremely rigid and severe provisions of this instrument terrified the people. Popular opposition against Cruz increased sharply and opposition newspapers started a violent campaign against this and the federal government in general. Members of the parliament and labor unions protested. An anti-vaccination league was organized. On November 10, the Vaccine Revolt exploded in Rio. Violent confrontations with the police ensued, with strikes, barricades, and shootings in the streets, as the population rose in protest against the government. On November 14, the Military Academy adhered to the revolt, but the cadets where dispersed after an intense shooting. The government declared a state of siege. On November 16, the uprising was controlled and the obligatory vaccination was suspended. In 1908, a violent smallpox epidemic made the people rush en masse to the vaccination units. Some 9,000 people died.Stepan, \\"Cruz\\" p. 303. Cruz was vindicated and his merit recognized. Later work Among the international scientific community, his prestige was already uncontested. In 1907, on occasion of the 14th International Congress on Hygiene and Demography in Berlin, Cruz was awarded with the gold medal in recognition of the sanitation of Rio de Janeiro. In 1909, he retired from the position as director general for Public Health, dedicating himself exclusively to the Manguinhos Institute, which has been named after him. From the institute he organized important scientific expeditions, which allowed a better knowledge about the health and life conditions in the interior of the country and contributed to the colonization of regions. Cruz eradicated urban yellow fever in the state of Pará. His sanitation campaign in the state of Amazonas allowed concluding the construction of the Madeira-Mamoré railroad, which was interrupted due to the great number of deaths from malaria and yellow fever among the workers. In 1913, Cruz was elected a member of the Brazilian Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1915, due to health problems, he resigned from the directorship of the Oswaldo Cruz Institute and moved to Petrópolis, a small city in the mountains near Rio. On August 18, 1916, he was elected mayor of that city and outlined an extensive urbanization project he would not see implemented. Death and legacy In the morning of February 11, 1917, at 44 years of age, he died of kidney failure. As a consequence of the short, fruitful life of Dr. Oswaldo Cruz, an extremely important scientific and health institution was born, which marked the beginning of experimental medicine in Brazil in many areas. To this day it exerts a strong influence on Brazilian science, technology and public health.

In 1973, Tobias wrote The Best Little Boy in the World, an autobiography in which he spoke of his experiences as a gay boy and young man. He published it under the pen name \\"John Reid\\" to avoid the repercussions of being openly gay; the book was republished in 1998 under his real name to coincide with a sequel, The Best Little Boy in the World Grows Up. Although he has never held a job in the investment industry, he has written extensively on the subject, including The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need, The Only Other Investment Guide You'll Ever Need, My Vast Fortune, Money Angles, The Invisible Bankers: Everything the Insurance Industry Never Wanted You to Know, and The Funny Money Game. He parlayed his writings and advice into success in the software industry with his Andrew Tobias's Managing Your Money financial application. Tobias books on other topics include Fire and Ice: The Charles Revson/Revlon Story, Getting By on $100,000 a Year, a collection of magazine pieces; Auto Insurance Alert, a book proposing radical insurance reform; Kids Say Don't Smoke on the efforts of tobacco companies to sell cigarettes to younger consumers (which was also published in Russian). After leaving New York Magazine in 1976, he was a contributing editor to Esquire, then Playboy, Time, and Parade.  Politics  In 1999 he became treasurer of the Democratic National Committee. He spearheaded a ballot initiative to convert California's auto insurance system into a no-fault system which would be paid for through a gasoline surcharge instead of premiums. He wrote a book on the topic, and funded a large part of the campaign himself.

This stylised O is meant to represent both a maple leaf (symbolising Canada) and the Peace Tower and Centre Block of the parliament buildings (symbolising Ottawa). It is meant to be simple, but look festive, and to create a feeling of vibrant motion when flying. The design uses the blue and green colours chosen to represent the new City of Ottawa. The blue is symbolic of rivers and waterways that are part of the Ottawa region, such as the Ottawa River. The large green areas speak to the large green space and quality of life in the area, as well as the forests, trees, and parkland within the city. It was adopted January 1, 2000 following the creation of the Ottawa \\"megacity\\". History Previously the Ottawa flag had been a purple, red and blue tricolour. This flag was adopted by the city in 1901 and when it was replaced it was the oldest municipal flag in Canada. The three colours were intended to represent purple for the monarchy, red for the Liberals, and blue for the Conservatives. The flag was not popular, however, with few liking its appearance. It also violated rules of heraldry by placing colour next to colour. In 1987, in an attempt to spruce it up, the city's coat of arms was added to the centre. There was little controversy when the transition board decided the new city should get a new flag.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 4, 2001\\\\. In the episode, Bart and Milhouse are banned from The Android's Dungeon after stopping Comic Book Guy from buying a box of priceless Star Wars memorabilia for $5. However, when Comic Book Guy suffers a massive heart attack after Tom Savini's show, he hires Bart and Milhouse as his replacements while he leaves his job to pursue a relationship with Agnes Skinner. \\"Worst Episode Ever\\" was written by Larry Doyle and directed by Matthew Nastuk. The series' staff found it hard to make Comic Book Guy seem likable, since he is usually portrayed as sarcastic and unfriendly. The episode features actor and makeup artist Tom Savini as himself. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 10 million viewers, finishing in 27th place in the ratings the week it aired. Since its broadcast, the episode received positive reviews from critics, and Hank Azaria won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his performance as Comic Book Guy in the episode. Plot Bart and Milhouse go out to spend $50 that Bart won when he bet Homer that he could not eat a box of rotten baking soda that Lisa dug out of the back of the refrigerator. But they get into trouble at The Android's Dungeon when, after talking Martin Prince's mom out of selling Martin's rare and invaluable Star Wars items to Comic Book Guy for only five dollars, they are banned for life from the store. When they hear that special effects artist Tom Savini is to appear at The Android's Dungeon, they plot to sneak in, but are rebuked at the door. During the interview, Savini repeatedly plays tricks on Comic Book Guy, which causes him to get enraged due to the wounding of his pride, and as he lashes out at Savini and everyone else in the comic book store, he suffers a heart attack. Dr. Hibbert tells Comic Book Guy that he needs to take a break from running the store and to leave it in the care of friends. Since he actually does not have any friends, Comic Book Guy reluctantly leaves the store in Bart and Milhouse's care. The store becomes wildly successful under the management of the two boys, only to lose much of its newfound prosperity after Milhouse orders a shipment of two thousand comics depicting \\"Biclops\\", a superhero with thick glasses, which flops spectacularly. Meanwhile, Homer helps a recovering Comic Book Guy look for a friend, but his attempts fail until he meets Agnes Skinner. Comic Book Guy and Agnes become romantically involved. After arguing, the boys accidentally discover a secret stash of illegal video clips. Bart and Milhouse charge admission for viewing such clips as a \\"good version\\" of The Godfather Part III, a clip of Mr. Rogers drunkenly yelling at the director of his show, a secret government plan to use Springfield as a testing zone for nuclear missiles, and Ned Flanders' alerting the police that Homer released a radioactive ape in his house. The scheme works until Chief Wiggum conducts a raid on the store, and later arrests Comic Book Guy for his unauthorized videotapes, after which Agnes declares she is too old to wait for him to be released. Bart and Milhouse, freed from running the Android's Dungeon and having managed to keep the profits from their time managing the store, decide that they have had fun, but it is time to go back to school. The episode ends with Ned still under the thumb of the radioactive ape. Production \\"Worst Episode Ever\\" was written by Larry Doyle and directed by Matthew Nastuk. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February 4, 2001.Scully, Mike. (2009). Commentary for \\"Worst Episode Ever\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The episode was originally called \\"The Fiver\\", a reference to a scene in the episode that was eventually removed. The episode title was then changed to \\"Worst Episode Ever\\", a title which the staff were amused by. According to Doyle, \\"Worst Episode Ever\\" is the first episode in which Comic Book Guy has a major role.Doyle, Larry. (2009). Commentary for \\"Worst Episode Ever\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Because Comic Book Guy is usually sarcastic and unfriendly, the series' staff found it hard to make the character seem likable. For example, Hank Azaria, who plays Comic Book Guy among other characters in the series, had a difficult time trying to make the character sound sincere. \\"Comic Book Guy only ever pronounces things sarcastically\\", Azaria said in the DVD commentary for the episode. \\"It was hard to find a way to sound believable and have him say sincere things. It took a lot of different takes.\\"Azaria, Hank. (2009). Commentary for \\"Worst Episode Ever\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully said, \\"It's tough when you take a character like Comic Book Guy or Krusty or Moe, to make them suddenly sympathetic and vulnerable. You have to cheat the character a little bit to open them up emotionally a little more.\\" In a scene in the episode, Ralph is seen entering the adult section of The Android's Dungeon. When he is off screen, Ralph can be heard saying \\"Everybody's hugging\\". In the DVD commentary for the episode, Azaria stated that the line is one of his favorite jokes in the series. Originally, Ralph's line would be \\"She's hungry\\", but it was eventually removed from the episode.Maxtone-Graham, Ian. (2009). Commentary for \\"Worst Episode Ever\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The episode features American actor and makeup artist Tom Savini as himself. Savini accepted the role because he is friends with Dana Gould, a former staff writer on The Simpsons. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Doyle said that Savini was \\"really fun\\" when he visited to record his lines. In a scene in the episode, a crow is seen tearing apart an issue of \\"Biclops\\". The voice of the crow was recorded from a real crow, even though the staff usually use main cast members Dan Castellaneta and Nancy Cartwright to imitate animal noises. The general officer in the government film called \\"Secret Nuclear Defense Plan\\" was voiced by Azaria. Cultural references In order to demonstrate the durability of Radioactive Man #1000, Comic Book Guy pours soda on it, which bounces off and instead damages a batch of \\"lesser\\" comics. On top of the batch is an issue of Bongo Comics, a comic book written by Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons. The comedian Gallagher is shown doing his routine with a watermelon during a flashback. While in The Android's Dungeon, Nelson examines a comic book called The Death of Sad Sack, a reference to both the American comic strip Sad Sack and the \\"Death of Superman\\" story arc. When Homer and Comic Book Guy enter Moe's Tavern, Moe says \\"Get out and take your Sacagawea dollars with you\\" to one of his customers. A Sacagawea dollar is a United States dollar coin which has been minted since 2000. After he is thrown out of Moe's Tavern, Comic Book Guy says the word \\"loneliness\\" in Klingon, a language used by the fictional Klingons in the Star Trek universe. While arguing with Agnes, Comic Book Guy says \\"Now I know what ever happened to Baby Jane.\\" The line is a reference to the 1960 suspense novel What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?. Martin's mother tries to sell Comic Book Guy several items relating to the Star Wars film series including Carrie Fisher's \\"anti-jiggle breast tape\\", George Lucas' handwritten original script of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope and a film of a supposed alternate ending for the series where it is revealed that \\"Luke's father is Chewbacca.\\" While fighting Milhouse, Bart picks up a robotic toy which unfolds into an axe. Milhouse picks up a similar toy, but it instead unfolds into a watering can. The toys are based on the franchise Transformers. While fighting, Milhouse and Bart fall through a poster that hides a room in The Android's Dungeon. While the poster depicts American actress Rita Hayworth as the Marvel Comics superheroine She-Hulk, the scene is a reference to the 1994 drama film The Shawshank Redemption, in which the main character escapes a prison by digging a tunnel in his wall behind a poster. One of the tapes that Bart and Milhouse watch shows Fred Rogers intoxicated. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean later met Rogers' wife at a hall of fame, and said that he was \\"really embarrassed\\" when he found out that she had seen the episode.Jean, Al. (2009). Commentary for \\"Worst Episode Ever\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Release and reception Hank Azaria won an Emmy for his portrayal of Comic Book Guy in the episode. In its original American broadcast on February 4, 2001, \\"Worst Episode Ever\\" received a 9.8 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 10 million viewers. The episode finished in 27th place in the ratings for the week of January 29 – February 4, 2001. Later that year, Azaria won the 53rd Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his role as Comic Book Guy in the episode. When participating in the ceremony, the actors are only allowed to submit one episode each, and that year, Azaria stated that \\"Worst Episode Ever\\" was an \\"obvious\\" choice for him. It was not the first time Azaria won the award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance; in 1998, he won it for his portrayal of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon in the series. On August 18, 2009, the episode was released as part of a DVD set called The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season. Mike Scully, Al Jean, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Matt Selman, Hank Azaria, Larry Doyle and Chris Kirkpatrick participated in the audio commentary for the episode. Following its broadcast, \\"Worst Episode Ever\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Casey Burchby of DVD Talk enjoyed the episode and wrote that it has some \\"great stuff\\" in it, including the comic book \\"Biclops\\" that Milhouse over-orders. Jason Bailey, another reviewer for DVD talk, applauded the writers for making an episode around a supporting character, and wrote that it is \\"far from [the series' worst episode]\\". Cindy White of IGN described the episode as a \\"classic\\", and in 2006, Kimberley Potts of AOL put the episode in twelfth place in a list of the series' 20 best episodes. The episode was also well received by the series' staff; in the introduction of The Simpsons Beyond Forever!: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family ...Still Continued, Matt Groening wrote that he particularly enjoyed the episode and that it had a \\"very special story\\". In the DVD commentary for the episode, Doyle said that Milhouse's line \\"I'm a human boy, just like you\\" is the best line he has ever written. However, Mac MacEntire of DVD Verdict gave the episode a mixed review. Although he praised the episode's premise, he argued that the episode was \\"ill-balanced\\" and that the subplot took up too much time in the episode. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson criticized the writers for making an episode based around a supporting character, and argued that Comic Book Guy was not featured enough in the episode. \\"'Ever' spends at least as much time with Bart and Milhouse as it does with CBG and Agnes\\", he wrote. He concluded that, aside from having a few \\"good moments\\", the episode is overall \\"pretty meh\\".

Called \\"the greatest disgrace ever dealt to American arms,\\"Howe (2007), p.63 a British force of army regulars and Royal Marines routed a combined US force of Regular Army and state militia troops at Bladensburg, Maryland, northeast of the federal capital, Washington, DC The American defeat resulted in the capture and burning of Washington. Background=British plans For the first two years of the War of 1812 (1812–1815), the British had been preoccupied with the war against Napoleon and his French Empire (France) in Europe. However, warships of the Royal Navy, led by Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, commander of the North American Station (coast) and Rear Admiral George Cockburn, controlled Chesapeake Bay from early 1813 onwards and had captured large numbers of U.S. trading vessels. They occupied Tangier Island off the coast of Virginia, establishing Fort Albion as an anchorage and staging area. As many as 1,200 British soldiers would be stationed there. Raiding parties had destroyed foundries, batteries and several small towns, but lack of troops restricted Cockburn to mounting small- scale raids, the largest of which was the Battle of Craney Island, in the Hampton Roads harbor near Norfolk, Virginia, which involved 2,000 men of the British Army and the Royal Marines. Although Cockburn withdrew from Chesapeake Bay late in 1813, his sailors had taken soundings and even placed buoys to mark channels and sandbars, in preparation for a renewed campaign in 1814.Howard (2012), p.97 By April 1814, Napoleon had been defeated and was exiled to the island of Elba off the coast of Italy. Large numbers of British ships and troops were now free to be used to prosecute the former backwater war with the United States. Most of these troops went to Canada where Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, Governor General of Canada and commander in chief in North America, was preparing to lead an invasion into New York from Canada, heading for Lake Champlain and the upper Hudson River. However, the Earl of Bathurst, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, dispatched a brigade composed mainly of veterans from the Duke of Wellington's army and commanded by Major General Robert Ross, to Bermuda, from where a blockade of the U.S. coast and even the occupation of some coastal islands had been overseen throughout the war. The intention was for this force to carry out raids on the Atlantic Seaboard to \\"effect a diversion on the coasts of the United States of America in favor of the army employed in the defence of Upper and Lower Canada\\".Hitsman, p.240. Instructions from the Earl of Bathurst to Ross. United States plans and preparations Meanwhile, Albert Gallatin, President James Madison's nominated commissioner for negotiations with the British government, sent news from Europe of Napoleon's abdication and the apparent hardening of British attitudes towards the United States.Howard (2012), pp.116-117 On 1 July 1814 Madison summoned his cabinet to discuss the increased threat to the United States' Atlantic coast, including Washington, although the Secretary of War, John Armstrong, insisted that the British would not attack Washington, since it was strategically unimportant. He felt the most likely target would be the city of Baltimore,Howard (2012) p.129 which offered more commercial targets and plunder than Washington. Armstrong was half right; the British would launch attacks against both Baltimore and Washington. Nevertheless, on 2 July, Madison designated the area around Washington and Baltimore as the United States Army's Tenth Military District and, without consulting Armstrong, appointed Brigadier General William H. Winder as its commander.Snow (2013), p.25 Winder was the nephew of Levin Winder, Federalist Governor of Maryland. He had practiced law in Baltimore before being commissioned as a colonel in 1812 and had only recently been exchanged after having been captured at the Battle of Stoney Creek in July 1813. On 5 July, he and Armstrong conferred. Winder suggested calling up some militia in advance of any attack, but Armstrong insisted that militia could best be used on the spur of the moment.Howard (2012), p.135 Winder spent a month visiting the forts and settlements in his new command. Armstrong did not provide him with any staff, and despite his fears that the British could launch an attack against almost any point with very little warning, Winder did not order any field fortifications to be constructed, nor make any other preparations.Howard (2012), pp.136-138 Campaign=British moves Although Major General Ross commanded the British troops in Chesapeake Bay, the point of attack was to be decided by Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane, commander in chief of the Royal Navy's North American Station. Cochrane had concentrated four ships of the line, twenty frigates and sloops of war and twenty transports carrying Ross's troops at Tangier Island.Forester, p.180 Rear Admiral Cockburn, Cochrane's second in command, favoured a quick attack on Washington, but Ross was not eager. His men had been confined aboard their transports for nearly three months, and he lacked cavalry, artillery and transport. Ross was also wary of the U.S. Chesapeake Bay Flotilla, lurking in the Patuxent River.Elting, p.204 His first objective had to be the capture or destruction of the U.S. flotilla. Cochrane dispatched two forces to make diversions. The frigate HMS Menelaus and some small craft threatened a raid on Baltimore, while two frigates and some bomb ketches and a rocket vessel ascended the Potomac River, an expedition that resulted in the successful Raid on Alexandria. His main body proceeded into the Patuxent. Ross's troops landed at Benedict on 19 August, and began marching upstream the following day, while Cockburn proceeded up the river with ships' boats and small craft. By 21 August, Ross had reached Nottingham, and Commodore Joshua Barney was forced to destroy the gunboats and other sailing craft of the Chesapeake Bay Flotilla the next day, and retreat overland towards Washington. Major-General Robert Ross, the British commander at Bladensburg Private in the Royal Marines, who would have fought at Bladensburg British Colonial Marine, of the Corps of Colonial Marines, in a fatigue uniform, as worn for ordinary duty. On the battlefield, the red coat would have been worn. 200 black soldiers of this corps were present at the battle From Nottingham, Ross continued up the Patuxent to Upper Marlboro, from where he could threaten to advance on either Washington or Baltimore, confusing the Americans. He might have taken the capital almost unopposed had he advanced on 23 August, but instead he rested his men and organised his force. On the night of 23–24 August, at the urging of Rear Admiral Cockburn and some of the British Army officers under his own command, Ross decided to risk an attack on Washington. He had four infantry battalions, a battalion of Royal Marines, a force of about 200 men of the Corps of Colonial Marines, which was composed of locally recruited black refugees from slavery, a rocket detachment from the Royal Marines battalion, 50 Royal Sappers and Miners, 100 gunners from the Navy and 275 sailors to carry supplies. His force totaled 4,370 men, with one 6-pounder gun, two 3-pounder guns and sixty launchers,Elting, p.207 each being attached to a Congreve rocket.The rocket itself would be attached to the side of a stick, doing so allowed them to be launched at a greater range. The \\"launcher\\" is the stick, which, when coupled with the rocket, would be mounted upon a bombarding frame, and fired. Rear Admiral Cockburn accompanied his force. Ross had a choice of two routes by which he could advance: from the south via Woodyard or from the east via Bladensburg. The former route would involve finding a way across an unfordable part of the Eastern Branch of the Potomac (now called the Anacostia River) if the U.S. destroyed the bridge on the route. In the morning of 24 August, Ross made a feint on the southern route, before suddenly swerving northwards towards Bladensburg. U.S. moves In Washington, Brigadier General Winder could call in theory upon 15,000 militia, but he actually had only 120 dragoons and 300 other Regulars, plus 1,500 poorly trained and under-equipped militiamen at his immediate disposal.Hitsman, p.241 On 20 August, Winder ordered this force to advance south towards Long Old Fields and Woodyard (off modern Route 5) to confront the British forces at Upper Marlboro. After a brief clash with Ross's leading units on 22 August, Winder ordered a hasty retreat to the Long Old Fields. He feared that the British might make a surprise night attack, in which the British would hold the advantage in organisation and discipline while Winder's own advantage in artillery would count for little.Howard (2012), p.168 Winder had been captured in just such a night attack at Stoney Creek the year before. Although he rode with the forces directly challenging the British invaders, Winder realized that Bladensburg was the key to Washington's defence. Bladensburg commanded the roads to Baltimore and Annapolis, along which reinforcements were moving to join him. The town also lay on one of the only two routes available for the British to advance on Washington, in fact the preferred route because the Eastern Branch was easy to ford there. On 20 August, Winder had ordered Brigadier General Tobias Stansbury to move from Baltimore to Bladensburg,Elting, p.206 \\"take the best position in advance of Bladensburg ... and should he be attacked, to resist as long as possible\\".\\"Narrative of General Winder, addressed to the chairman of the Committee of Investigation\\" as quoted in On 22 August, Stansbury deployed his force on Lowndes Hill, where he hastily dug earthworks for artillery emplacements. The road from Annapolis crossed the hill, and the road from Upper Marlboro ran to its south and west. Furthermore, the roads to Washington, Georgetown, and Baltimore all intersected behind between it and Bladensburg. From this position, Stansbury dominated the approaches available to the British while controlling the lines of communication. At 2:30 a.m. on 23 August, Stansbury received a message from Winder, informing him that he had withdrawn across the Eastern Branch and he intended to fire the lower bridge. Surprised, Stansbury was seized by an irrational fear that his right flank could be turned. Instead of strengthening his commanding position, he immediately decamped and marched his exhausted troops across Bladensburg bridge, which he did not burn, to a brickyard further on. He had thus thrown away almost every tactical advantage available to him. Meanwhile, in Washington, every government department was hastily packing its records and evacuating them to Maryland or Virginia, in requisitioned or hired carts or river boats.Howard (2012), pp.166-167 Battle=U.S. dispositions Brigadier General William H. Winder, the American commander at the Battle of Bladensburg and nephew to Levin Winder, the Governor of Maryland Winder now had at least 1,000 regulars from the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps, plus about 7,000 less than dependable militia and volunteers from the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia. Official reports of his strength range from 5,000 to 9,000 men. Winder's report to the Secretary of War stated that he was able \\"By the most active and harassing movement of the troops to interpose before the enemy at Bladensburg about 5,000.\\"Eaton, p.9 Ross, the British commander, estimated the American force at between 8,000 and 9,000 men, with 300–400 cavalry. From other contemporary sources, the forces available for the defense of Washington probably numbered about 7,170, of which 6,370 were at Bladensburg. Stansbury's force consisted of the 1st (Ragan's), 2nd (Schutz's), and 5th (Sterrett's) regiments of Maryland Militia, three companies of volunteer riflemen commanded by Major William Pinkney (a former United States Attorney General), and two companies of Baltimore artillery, with six 6-pounder guns. Ragan's and Schutz's regiments were hastily organised amalgamations of companies, all without uniforms. Sterrett's 5th Maryland Regiment was a \\"Dandy\\" regiment of uniformed volunteers. Stansbury chose a defensible position, though hardly the best one available, on the west side of the Eastern Branch of the Potomac opposite the town of Bladensburg. The artillery was posted in an earthwork hastily constructed by Colonel Decius Wadsworth, the Army's Commissary General of Ordnance, to the north of the bridge.Elting, p.213 The earthwork had been designed for heavier weapons, and the 6-pounder field guns had a restricted field of fire through its embrasures. They could not use oblique fire to prevent the bridge from being seized. The Maryland militia infantry regiments were posted in a line of battle south of the earthwork, too far away to protect the artillery and exposed to British fire. Both Winder and Secretary of State James Monroe later tinkered with Stansbury's dispositions. Monroe moved companies and detachments without correcting the major faults in Stansbury's position, while Winder moved the three militia regiments into even more exposed positions behind the Baltimore artillery's redoubt, though Monroe reinforced them with a militia artillery company under Captain Benjamin Burch.Elting, p.214 Monroe also ordered the 120 U.S. Dragoons under Colonel Jacint Lavall to occupy a ravine behind Stansbury's infantry, but left them without further orders or information.Snow (2013), p.86 Commodore Joshua Barney, U.S. Navy commander of the Chesapeake Bay Flotilla, whose sailors and Marines' artillery battery briefly held off the British advance on the upper hill of present-day Fort Lincoln Cemetery Behind Stansbury's troops and to his right was a brigade of District of Columbia militia under Brigadier General Walter Smith, which had marched from Long Old Fields. Smith's brigade was strongly posted behind a creek and along the crest of some rising ground, but Smith had not conferred with Stansbury before deploying his brigade, and there was a gap of a mile between them. Smith's men would be unable to support Stansbury, and if Stansbury were overcome, Smith's left flank would be open to attack. A battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Kramer lined the creek. Joshua Barney's men, with two 18-pounder guns and three 12-pounder guns drawn from the Washington Navy Yard, were posted astride the Washington turnpike. (Barney had originally been posted to guard the lower bridge over the Eastern Branch and destroy it if necessary, but he had pleaded to President Madison and the Secretary of the Navy that he and his men were needed where the action was.)Howard (2012>, pp.178-179). To Barney's left was the 1st Regiment of \\"District\\" Militia, a militia artillery company under Major George Peter with six 6-pounder guns and a provisional battalion of regulars under Lieutenant Colonel William Scott. The 2nd District Militia were posted behind Peter and Scott.Elting, p.215 To Smith's right rear in turn was a column of Maryland militia under Colonel William Beall, which had just arrived from Annapolis. A regiment of Virginia Militia under Colonel George Minor was delayed by administrative confusion and arrived on the field only as the battle ended.Elting, p.212 (Minor's men had arrived in Washington without arms or ammunition. When Minor prevailed on Winder to order muskets to be distributed on the morning of the battle, the junior officer responsible for issuing their flints insisted that they be returned and recounted.)Snow (2013), pp.72-73 Stansbury's troops were tired from two days' constant alarms and redeployments, and Smith's and Beall's men were equally exhausted from having force-marched to the battlefield through a hot and humid summer day, with many diversions and unnecessary panics. Action The 200th Anniversary reenactment of the battle, on August 23, 2014, showing the British line infantrymen advancing Around noon on 24 August, Ross's army reached Bladensburg. Stansbury's tactical errors quickly became apparent. Had he held Lowndes Hill, Stansbury could have made the British approach a costly one (although this would have involved fighting with the East Branch at his back, which would not have improved his men's morale and might have been disastrous in a hasty retreat). Had he held the brick structures of Bladensburg, which were ready-made mini-fortresses, he might have embroiled Ross's troops in bloody street fighting. Because the bridge had not been burned, it had to be defended. Stansbury's infantry and artillery were posted too far from the river's edge to contest a crossing effectively. The British advance was led by Colonel William Thornton's 85th Light Infantry and the three light companies of the other line battalions. The Baltimore artillery and Pinkney's riflemen stopped Thornton's first rush across the bridge. Major Harry Smith, Ross's Brigade major, considered that Ross and Thornton had attacked too hastily, without waiting for other units to support Thornton, or sending forward skirmishers across the fords to cover the advance.Snow (2013), pp.85-88 However, Thornton's men eventually established themselves on the south bank of the river, and began advancing in loose order. The Baltimore artillery had solid shot only, which was of little use against scattered skirmishers.Elting, p.216 Pinkney (whose elbow was shattered by a musket ball)Snow (2013), p.90 was driven back and as Thornton's men closed in, the Baltimore artillerymen retreated with five of their cannon, being forced to spike and abandon another. The British 1/44th Regiment had meanwhile forded the East Branch above the bridge. As they prepared to envelop the American left, Winder led a counter-attack against Thornton by Sterrett's 5th Maryland militia, joined by other detachments.Elting, p.217 As the 5th Maryland exchanged fire with British infantry in cover on three sides, Schutz's and Ragan's conscripted militia broke and fled under a barrage of Congreve rockets. Winder issued confused orders for three of Captain Burch's guns to fall back rather than cover Sterrett's retreat, and the 5th Maryland and the rest of Stansbury's brigade fled the field, sweeping most of Lavall's horsemen with them.Snow (2013), p.92 The British pressed on and were engaged by Smith's brigade and Barney's and Peters's guns. Thornton's light brigade made several frontal attacks over the creek, but were repulsed three times by artillery fire, and were counter-attacked by Barney's detachment.Elting, p.218 Thornton was badly wounded and his light infantry were driven back with heavy casualties. However, as the 1/44th threatened Smith's open left flank, Winder ordered Smith to retreat also.Howe, p.63 Charles Waterhouse's painting of the U.S. Marines manning their guns at Bladensburg, on the boundary of Washington- Maryland Smith's brigade fell back initially in good order, but Winder's orders to retreat apparently did not reach Barney, and his situation worsened when the civilian drivers of the carts carrying his reserve ammunition joined the general rout, leaving the Marine gun crews with fewer than three rounds of canister, round shot and charges in their caissons. Barney's 300 sailors and 103 Marines nevertheless held off the British frontal attacks. Eventually, as the British 1/4th and 1/44th Regiments enveloped their left flank, Barney ordered his men to retreat to avoid capture.Hitsman and Graves, p.243 Barney himself was badly wounded in the thigh with a musket ball and was taken prisoner. Beall's troops were also driven from the hill they held, after an ineffectual resistance. Winder had not given any instructions before the battle in the case of a retreat and as the American militia left the battlefield, he issued contradictory orders to halt and reform, or fall back on the Capitol where Secretary of War John Armstrong, Jr. hoped vainly to make a stand, using the federal buildings as strongpoints, or retreat through Georgetown to Tenleytown. Most of the militia simply fled the field with no destination in mind, or deserted the ranks to see to the safety of their families.Elting, p.219 Casualties Although the British had suffered heavier casualties than the Americans (many inflicted by Barney's guns), they had completely routed the defenders. British casualties were 64 dead and 185 wounded. Some of the British dead \\"died without sustaining a scratch. They collapsed from heat exhaustion and the strain of punishing forced marches over the five days since landing at Benedict\\".Pitch, pp.80-81 Heidler's Encyclopedia of the War of 1812 gives the American loss as \\"10 or 12 killed, 40 wounded\\" and \\"about 100\\" captured. Henry Adams and John S. Williams both give the American casualties as 26 killed and 51 wounded.Quimby, p.689. Quimby refers to History of the United States of America during the Administration of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison (New York, The Antiquarian Press, 1962) by Henry Adams and History of the Invasion and Capture of Washington, etc. (New York, Harper and Brothers, 1857) by John S. Williams. Joseph A. Whitehorne says the Americans lost \\"120 taken prisoner, many of these wounded\\".Whitehorne, p.136 Ten cannon and two colors-1st Harford Light Dragoons {Maryland} and the James City Light Infantry {VA} were captured by the British. For many of the American wounded, Naval Hospital Washington was the primary treatment center. Thirty-three incoming patients recorded in August and September 1814 were American seamen, soldiers, and marines wounded from Bladensburg or subsequent engagements. One British soldier, Jeremiah McCarthy is also recorded. The majority of those wounded however, were first treated on the field of battle and often by British surgeons. Despite the war, both sides generally respected hospitals and afforded care to the enemy wounded. The naval hospital's 1814 register reflects American seamen Frederick Ernest and George Gallagher both endured amputations in the field.Register of Patients at Naval Hospital Washington DC 1814 With the Names of American Wounded from the Battle of Bladensburg Transcribed with Introduction and Notes by John G.

From the 1816 book, The History of England, from the Earliest Periods, Volume 1 by Paul M. Rapin de Thoyras. The hasty and disorganized American retreat led to the battle becoming known as the \\"Bladensburg Races\\" from an 1816 poem. The battle was termed \\"the greatest disgrace ever dealt to American arms\\" and \\"the most humiliating episode in American history\\". The American militia actually fled through the streets of Washington. President James Madison and most of the rest of the federal government had been present at the battle, and had nearly been captured. They too fled the capital, and scattered through Maryland and Virginia. That same night the British entered Washington unopposed and set fire to many of the government buildings in what became known as the Burning of Washington. Lieutenant General Prevost had urged Vice Admiral Cochrane to avenge the Raid on Port Dover on the north shore of Lake Erie earlier in the year, in which the undefended settlement had been set ablaze by American troops. Cochrane issued a proclamation that American property was forfeit; only the lives of the civilian inhabitants were to be spared. He had issued a private memorandum to his captains however, which allowed them to levy what was effectively protection money in return for sparing buildings. In fact, there was little or no looting or wanton destruction of private property by Ross's troops or Cochrane's sailors during the advance and the occupation of Washington. However, when the British later withdrew to their ships in the Patuxent, discipline was less effective (partly because of fatigue) and there was considerable looting by foraging parties and by stragglers and deserters.Elting, p.222 After Major General Ross was killed at the Battle of North Point on 12 September 1814, his descendants were given an augmentation of honour to their armorial bearings by a royal warrant dated 25 August 1815, and their family name was changed to the victory title Ross- of-Bladensburg in memory of Ross's most famous battle. The lineages of the 5th Maryland Regiment and the Columbian Division are perpetuated by the present- day 175th Infantry (ARNG MD) and the HHD/372nd Military Police Battalion (ARNG DC), two of only nineteen Army National Guard units with campaign credit for the War of 1812. The lineages of the old 36th and 38th Infantry Regiments are perpetuated by three currently active battalions of the 4th Infantry (1-4 Inf, 2-4 Inf and 3-4 Inf). In the British Army, the Battle Honour \\"Bladensburg\\" was awarded to the 4th, 21st, 44th and 85th Regiments of Foot. The successor units within the British Army are, respectively: The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, the Royal Regiment of Scotland, the Royal Anglian Regiment and the Rifles.

The Ship, the Men and the Wars of the USS Constitution (Fireship Press, 2007), 50 This force provided crucial artillery support during the battle.Battle of Bladensburg Reputations Ruined University of Maryland https://www.lib.umd.edu/bladensburg/reputation-ruined/battle-of-bladensburg accessed 23 May 2018 One of the best accounts is that of Charles Ball, born 1785. Ball served with Commodore Barney at Bladensburg and later helped man the defenses at Baltimore. In his 1837 memoir, Ball reflected on the Battle of Bladensburg: \\"I stood at my gun, until the Commodore was shot down... if the militia regiments, that lay upon our right and left, could have been brought to charge the British, in close fight, as they crossed the bridge, we should have killed or taken the whole of them in a short time; but the militia ran like sheep chased by dogs.\\"Charles Ball Slavery in the United States: A Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Charles Ball, a Black Man, Who Lived Forty Years in Maryland, South Carolina and Georgia, as a Slave Under Various Masters, and was One Year in the Navy with Commodore Barney, During the Late War (New York: John S. Taylor 1837). Modern scholars estimate that blacks made up 15% to 20% of the American naval forces in the War of 1812. The black American seaman Harry Jones is enumerated patient No. 35 on the 1814 Register of Patients, Naval Hospital Washington, which states, \\"Harry Jones black boy wound Bladensburg.\\" \\"Boy\\" in this context was a reference to rank. \\"Boys\\" in the early navy were simply young sailors in training who were 12 to 18. Just before the battle, Commodore Barney, on being asked by Madison \\"if his negroes would not run on the approach of the British?\\" replied: \\"No Sir... they don't know how to run; they will die by their guns first.\\"Elizabeth Dowling Taylor A Slave in the White House: Paul Jennings and the Madison's Palgrave (McMillen: New York 2012), p.49. The Commodore was correct as the men did not run; one such man was young sailor Harry Jones (No. 35), apparently a free black. Jones was wounded in the final action at Bladensburg and remained a patient at the Naval Hospital Washington, DC, for nearly two months.Register of Patients at Naval Hospital Washington DC 1814 With the Names of American Wounded from the Battle of Bladensburg Transcribed with Introduction and Notes by John G.

Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane formed the Corps of Colonial Marines in 1813, deliberately recruiting enslaved blacks with a promise of freedom for themselves and their families. The corps received the same training, uniforms, pay, and pensions as their Royal Marine counterparts.William S. Dudley, editor The Naval War of 1812: A Documentary History Volume II. (Naval Historical Center: Washington, DC 1992), 324-325.

Battlefield preservation Like many historic battlefields that once belonged to the rural American landscape, urban sprawl and heavily-traveled roads associated with urbanization in the DC metro area have made it very difficult to preserve and acquire the complete site of the Bladensburg battleground. However, the City of Bladensburg, in association with Prince George's County and the State of Maryland, has set up a number of historical markers in various places of importance on the battlefield and offers a walking tour, with a free audio \\"tour guide\\" to help one explore the battlefield itself. Prince George's County had also established a museum for the battle at the Bladensburg Waterfront Park, but the museum is permanently closed.

It is located in sub-Saharan Africa, and is home to the superhero Black Panther. Wakanda first appeared in Fantastic Four #52 (July 1966), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Wakanda has appeared in comics and various media adaptations, including the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Captain America: Civil War (2016), Black Panther (2018), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). A highly developed country, Wakanda is the most technologically advanced nation on the planet. Location In the MCU, Wakanda is located just north of Lake Turkana, at a point bordering Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda and South Sudan. Wakanda is located in East Africa, although its exact location has varied throughout the nation's publication history: some sources place Wakanda just north of Tanzania and exactly at Burundi,Fantastic Four vol. 3 #21 while others such as Marvel Atlas #2 show it at the north end of Lake Turkana, in between South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia (and surrounded by fictional countries like Azania, Canaan, and Narobia). In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, on-screen maps use the location given in Marvel Atlas #2. Director Ryan Coogler stated that his depiction of Wakanda in the 2018 film Black Panther was inspired by the Southern African Kingdom of Lesotho. In recent stories by writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, Wakanda is located on Lake Victoria, near Mohannda, Canaan, Azania and Niganda. This places these nations mostly in what in real life is the eastern half of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Birnin Zana is located within Wakanda. It is considered by some to be a smart city.Finding Birnin Zana In Birnin Zana, pedestrians walk along commerce-filled streets that are car-free except for the occasional appearance of (buslike) shuttles. The whole is quite similar to the Woonerf Concept, an approach to public space design which started in the Netherlands in the 1970s. Maglev trains are seen zipping above and around the city. The Wakandan buildings incorporate some traditional African elements (i.e. thatch roofs and hanging gardens) on some of the tallest structures.The Real-Life Possibilities of Black Panther's Wakanda, According to Urbanists and City Planners History Before the emergence of the Wakanda nation, mystic beings known as Originators were expelled from the region by the Heliopolitans. This was later retconned as the Orisha, the pantheon of Wakanda consisting of Thoth, Ptah, Mujaji, Kokou and Bast, the Panther Goddess. In the distant past, a massive meteorite made up of the element vibranium crashed in Wakanda. It was unearthed a generation before the events of the present day. T'Challa, the current Black Panther, is the son of T'Chaka, the Black Panther before him and a descendant of Bashenga. Knowing that others would attempt to manipulate and dominate Wakanda for this rare and valuable resource, T'Chaka conceals his country from the outside world. He sells off minute amounts of the valuable vibranium while surreptitiously sending the country's best scholars to study abroad, consequently turning Wakanda into one of the world's most technologically advanced nations. Eventually, however, the explorer Ulysses Klaue finds his way to Wakanda and covers up his work on a vibranium-powered, sound-based weapon. When exposed, Klaue kills T'Chaka, only to see his \\"sound blaster\\" turned on him by a grieving teenaged T'Challa. Klaue's right hand is destroyed, and he and his men flee. Wakanda has an unusually high rate of mutation due to the dangerously mutagenic properties of the Vibranium Mound. A large number of these Wakandan Mutates are working for Erik Killmonger. Vibranium radiation has permeated much of Wakanda's flora and fauna, including the Heart-Shaped Herb eaten by members of the Black Panther Cult (although T'Challa once allowed a dying Spider-Man to eat it in the hope that it would help him deal with a mysterious illness) and the flesh of the White Gorilla eaten by the members of the White Gorilla Cult. In the 2008 \\"Secret Invasion\\" storyline, Skrull forces led by Commander K'vvvr invade Wakanda and engage Black Panther and his forces. Due to heavy resistance to the deployment of technological developments, both sides are forced to fight with swords and spears. The Wakandan forces voluntarily wear panther masks; this prevents the Skrulls from focusing attacks on their leader. Despite losses, the Wakandans defeat the Skrulls. They kill every single one, including K'vvvr, and send their ship back, packed with the bodies. A warning against invading Wakanda is left written on the wall of the ship's control center.\\"Black Panther\\" vol. 4, #38-41. Marvel Comics While under the cosmic power of the Phoenix Force, Namor attacks Wakanda for hiding the Avengers and destroys much of the country with a tidal wave. After the attack, all mutants are banned from Wakanda as stated by Black Panther. Some students from the Jean Grey school are attacked by the Wakandan people; the students barely flee with the help of Storm. Wakanda expanded his legacy to form an intergalactic empire on Planet Bast. Wakanda's cults Wakanda contains a number of religious cults devoted to Heliopolitan deities, who left ancient Egypt at the time of the pharaohs. Panther cult Bast the Panther Goddess, based on Bastet the ancient Egyptian deity, is the primary deity of Wakanda. After the vibranium meteor fell, a number of Wakandans were painfully mutated into \\"demon spirits\\" and began attacking their fellow Wakandans. T'Challa's ancestor Bashenga begun to close the vibranium mound to outsiders. He formed a religious order that guarded the mound and fought to keep the \\"demon spirits\\" from spreading across the kingdom. As the ceremonial and religious role, he took the title of Black Panther as chief of the Panther Tribe. As part of the cult's ceremonies, a Black Panther is entitled to the use of a heart-shaped herb. The herb enhances the physical attributes of the person who consumes it to near-superhuman levels, in a similar manner to the super-soldier serum. White Gorilla cult The Jabari tribe is known for worshiping gorilla gods: Ghekre, based on the Baoulé deity of the same name and Ngi,And based on the Yaounde deity of the same name. Wakanda evolved from a hunter-warrior society, and was traditionally ruled by its greatest warrior. The dominant Black Panther Cult outlawed the rival White Gorilla Cult's worship in Wakanda. M'Baku (Man-Ape) of the Jabari tribe is one of Wakanda's greatest warriors, second only to T'Challa, the Black Panther himself. While T'Challa, king of Wakanda, is on a several month leave of absence from Wakanda, the ambitious M'Baku plots to usurp the throne. M'Baku flouts T'Challa's edicts and revives the White Gorilla Cult, killing one of the rare white gorillas living in the jungles near Wakanda. M'Baku bathes in the gorilla's blood and eats its flesh which \\"mystically\\" confers the gorilla's great strength upon M'Baku. He tries to defeat T'Challa in combat, hoping to take over the country, but is beaten and banished from Wakanda. According to the 2018 film, the White Gorilla cult, known in the film as the Jabari (or the Mountain Tribe), revere the monkey god Hanuman.What India can learn from ‘Black Panther’ Lion cult Sekmet the Lion Goddess, based on the deity of the same name, could possess the form of any human worshipers or the bodies of those sanctified and sacrificed by her worshipers, she transformed these subjects into human avatars of herself. She has a number of other powers, some of which she has demonstrated. Sekhmet could grow in size, move at rapid speeds, teleport herself and others, and alter her specific density. The Lion goddess possessed superhuman strength and durability, and she was immortal. She can manipulate the minds of the weak- willed. Little is known of the history of the Lion Goddess. She had apparently lost many worshipers over the years to the Cult of the Panther God, despite the fact that Sekhmet physically manifested before its followers, and the Panther God only appears to its priests. Crocodile cult Sobek the Crocodile God, based on the deity of the same name, appears to be an ancient and somewhat forgotten Wakandan deity.As seen in Black Panther vol. 5 #3 (April 2009)  Name  There are several theories for the name of Wakanda. The name may be inspired by a Siouan god called Wakanda, Wakonda, or Waconda, or Wakandas, a fictional African tribe from Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel The Man-Eater, written in 1915 but published posthumously in 1957, or the Kenyan tribe Kamba, Akamba or Wakamba,Black Panther: storia, cultura, geografia e religioni del Wakanda or the word \\"kanda\\", which means \\"family\\" in Kikongo. Language In the comics, Wakanda has three official languages: Wakandan, Yoruba and Hausa. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe characters from Wakanda are portrayed speaking the South-East African Xhosa language. The Jabari Tribe are portrayed speaking a dialect similar to Igbo from Nigeria. Defenses In the comics, Wakanda is the foremost military power on Marvel Earth. The Wakandan Army is the country's main ground forces, while the Wakandan Navy oversees naval operations. The Wakandan Air Guard is the nation's air force, which includes pilots wearing powerful suits of combat armor. In order to ensure peace and stability in Wakanda, the Black Panther picked Dora Milaje (\\"adored ones\\") from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives- in-training. Wakanda has its own intelligence system known as the N'Charu Silema; a spy network that worked across the globe to maintain the nation's secrecy. It was considered as good as the Mossad and certainly better than the CIA and MI6. later, P.R.I.D.E. (Princess Regent Intelligence Division Executives) was developed as the nation's protection agency. Wakanda is one of the few Earth-616 civilizations who have contingency plans for dealing with Galactus, \\"The Devourer of Worlds\\". Cultural impact In December 2019, it was discovered that the US Department of Agriculture's website listed Wakanda as a free-trade partner, with a list of traded goods which included ducks, donkeys and dairy cows. The USDA claimed the fictional country had been added to the list \\"by accident during a staff test\\" and removed it soon after the public became aware of it. The Wakandan capital city (Birnin Zana) could offer an alternative for what future cities could be like in Africa.The Real-Life Possibilities of Black Panther's Wakanda, According to Urbanists and City Planners There are already many smart city initiatives being worked out in Africa.https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2017/11/01/smart-city- initiatives-in-africa/ Smart city initiatives in Africa] Akon City, a planned city in Senegal, is inspired by Wakanda's capital city,R&B; singer Akon is building a 'real-life Wakanda' worth $6 billion in Senegal and there are many ecocities that are emerging across Africa.The Real-Life Possibilities of Black Panther's Wakanda, According to Urbanists and City Planners In other media=Novels * J.

In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, its location was established in Captain America: Civil War when it was shown on a map: at the northern end of Lake Turkana, at a fictional point bordering Ethiopia, South Sudan, Uganda, and Kenya. In real life, this area is actually a disputed border region known as the Ilemi Triangle, claimed by each of these countries. The Black Panther film further established that, in keeping with this map location, it is a landlocked country in the central mountains far from the coasts. Impassable mountains and jungles around its borders have helped Wakanda isolate itself from outsiders. Internally, Wakanda consists of lush river valleys, mountain ranges rich in natural resources, and a fabulous capital city that integrates space-age technology with traditional designs. * Wakanda appears prominently in the 2018 film Black Panther, which further expands on its background and culture. The film establishes that, as in the comics, the Black Panther's super-strength comes from consuming the \\"heart- shaped herb\\", stating that it is local vegetation that was mutated over millions of years of exposure to Vibranium. Wakanda consists of five tribes, four of which were united under the rule of the first Black Panther 10,000 years ago. As in the comics, the four tribes (The River tribe, the Mining tribe, the Merchant tribe, and the Border tribe) worship Bast, the panther god, amongst others, and also have a strong spiritual tradition of ancestor worship. The River Tribe wear green clothes made from crocodile skin and some males have a lip plate on them. The Mining Tribe are in charge of the Vibranium that is mined, stored, and utilized. The Merchant Tribe are responsible for trades and crafts of art, clothing and pieces of art where they also wear veils during a trade to maintain anonymity. The Border Tribe reside on the mountainous borders of Wakanda posing as farmers in order to deceive foreigners of Wakanda's wealth as well as their talent of breeding white rhinoceros even for battle. The fifth tribe are the Jabari, who follow the white gorilla cult (of the god Hanuman) – they are staunch traditionalists who live isolated up in the mountains. While considered part of Wakanda, the Black Panther's hold over the Jabari is tenuous; during the film, their leader M'Baku rejects T'Challa as a worthy heir to the throne during his coronation, and challenges him to ceremonial combat to claim it for himself. The lords of each tribe sit on the king's councils, and after the Mountain tribe assists T'Challa in his overthrow of the usurper, N'Jadaka aka Erik Kilmonger, to take back the throne, M'Baku is also granted a seat on that council in recognition of his loyalty. The four main tribes of Wakanda speak a version of the Xhosa language, while the Jabari speak an Igbo dialect. The opening animated sequence explains Wakanda was aware that the outside world was becoming increasingly chaotic, throughout the various events of history affecting Africa such as the Atlantic slave trade, the colonisation of Africa by European powers, World War I, and World War II. The Black Panthers of the past, however, were devoted to defending their own country and did not interfere, instead choosing to hide Wakanda from the world - fearing that if they became involved and revealed themselves, it would eventually lead outsiders to try to invade Wakanda itself. Wakanda passes itself off as a small, poor Third World nation of humble herdsmen, using an advanced holographic projection shroud around its borders to hide the advanced technological civilization within. A core tension of the film's narrative is that the new Black Panther, T'Challa, is torn between his loyalty to hide and defend Wakanda as its king, and his own conscience to help the faltering world beyond its borders. Erik Killmonger then arrives in Wakanda to try to seize the throne - mirroring T'Challa's desire to end Wakanda's isolationism, but by conquering the outside world using Wakanda's advanced technologies and weapons. Ultimately, T'Challa defeats Killmonger and decides to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world during an address at the United Nations. The film's popularity led to a trend among athletes and celebrities around the world to throw up \\"Wakanda Forever\\" salutes after their victories. Director Ryan Coogler stated that his depiction of Wakanda was inspired by the southern African kingdom of Lesotho. Basotho blankets also became more known as a result of the film and its basis on Lesotho.https://www.businessinsider.co.za/black-panther-has-not-real-effect- on-the-south-african-sale-of-basotho-blankts-2018-3 * Wakanda appears in Avengers: Infinity War. When the Avengers learn of Thanos' quest for the Infinity Stones, they travel to Wakanda so that the country's advanced science can remove the Mind Stone from Vision's head without killing him. When Thanos's forces attack Wakanda, the Avengers join forces with Wakanda's army to hold off Thanos' forces. Despite the aid of Thor, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot, Thanos is able to claim the Mind Stone, completing the Infinity Gauntlet. Thanos then eliminates half the population of the universe, including T’Challa and several Wakandans. M’Baku and Okoye survive Thanos' finger snap, alongside Steve Rogers, Thor, Banner, Black Widow, Rocket, and War Machine, all present during the Wakanda battle. * Wakanda also briefly appears in Avengers: Endgame after the final battle against 2014 Thanos and Tony Stark's sacrifice.

Plot summary After the Second World War, Katherine \\"Kitty\\" Fremont, a widowed American nurse, is sightseeing in Cyprus following a tour of duty for the U.S Public Health Service in Greece. Her guide mentions the Karaolos internment camp on Cyprus, where thousands of Jews—Holocaust survivors—are detained by the British, who refuse them passage to Palestine. Kitty visits British General Sutherland, who knew her late husband. When Sutherland suggests she volunteer at the internment camp for a few days, Kitty declines, citing she would feel uncomfortable around Jews. She reconsiders shortly after another officer makes an anti-semitic remark. Haganah rebel Ari Ben Canaan, a former decorated captain in the Jewish Brigade of the British Army in the Second World War, obtains a cargo ship. He smuggles 611 Jews out of the camp and onto the ship for an illegal voyage to Mandate Palestine. Military authorities discover the plan and blockade Famagusta harbor, preventing the ship's departure. The refugees stage a hunger strike, during which the camp's doctor dies and Ari threatens to blow up the ship and the refugees. The British relent and allow the ship, rechristened the Exodus, set sail. While helping at the camp, Kitty meets Karen Hansen Clement, a Danish-Jewish teenager. Kitty grows fond of Karen and offers to take her back to America with her. Karen, whose mother and siblings died in the Holocaust, is searching for her missing father. She has also aligned herself with the Zionist cause, and, wanting to go to Palestine, eventually turns down Kitty's offer. Meanwhile, opposition to partitioning Palestine into separate Arab and Jewish states is intensifying. Karen's young beau, Dov Landau, is recruited into the Irgun, a radical pro- Zionist group. Ari Ben Canaan's uncle, Akiva, who heads the Irgun, first interviews Dov. Before swearing him in, Akiva forces Dov into confessing he was a Sonderkommando in Auschwitz and was sodomized by Nazis. This is where Dov acquired his bomb expertise. Akiva's violent activities run counter to his brother Barak, Ari's father, who heads the mainstream Jewish Agency working to create a Jewish state through political and diplomatic means. Barak fears the Irgun will derail these efforts, especially as the British have placed a price on Akiva's head. Karen goes to live at Gan Dafna, a fictional Jewish kibbutz near Mount Tabor near the moshav where Ari was raised.An actual kibbutz named Dafna is located near the present Lebanese border. Kitty and Ari have fallen in love, but Kitty pulls back, feeling like an outsider after meeting Ari's family and learning about his previous love: Dafna, a young woman kidnapped, tortured, and murdered by Arabs, who is the namesake of the Gan Dafna kibbutz. Ari helps locate Karen's father, Dr. Clement, who is a permanent in-patient at a Jerusalem mental hospital. He is in a dissociative state that is borderline vegetative, caused by the horrors he suffered in a concentration camp. When Karen visits, she is devastated that she is unrecognizable to him. When the Irgun bombs the King David Hotel in an act of terrorism resulting in dozens of fatalities, Akiva is arrested, imprisoned in Acre fortress, and sentenced to hang. To save Akiva's life and free Haganah and Irgun fighters imprisoned by the British, Ari plots an escape. Dov, who eluded capture after the hotel bombing, turns himself in to utilize his bomb-making expertise to facilitate the Acre Prison break. Hundreds of prisoners escape, including Akiva, though he is fatally wounded as he and Ari evade a roadblock. Ari is also wounded, but makes it to Gan Dafna where Dr. Lieberman removes a bullet from Ari. With the British on Ari's trail, he is taken to Abu Yesha, an Arab village near Gan Dafna, where his lifelong Arab friend, Taha, is the mukhtar. When a recovering Ari develops a life-threatening infection, Kitty saves his life. This rekindles their romance. Meanwhile, the British arrest Dr. Lieberman when they find an illegal weapons cache hidden within the children's village. An independent Israel is now in sight, but Arab nationals commanded by Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, plot to attack Gan Dafna and massacre the Jews, including the children. Taha warns Ari of the impending attack, though he reluctantly says he must join the Grand Mufti in fighting the establishment of Israel. Ben Canaan orders the younger children be evacuated to safety during the night as a small detachment of Palmach troops arrives to reinforce Gan Dafna's defenses. Karen, ecstatic over the prospect of the new nation, goes to find Dov (who is on night patrol at the Gan Dafna perimeter) and proclaims her love for him. Dov says they will marry when the war is over. As Karen returns to Gan Dafna, she is ambushed and murdered by Arabs. Dov discovers her lifeless body the following morning. The same day, Taha's body is found hanging in his village, killed by the Grand Mufti. A Star of David is carved into his body and a swastika and a sign saying \\"Jude\\" are on village walls. Karen and Taha are buried together in one grave. Ari eulogizes them, saying that someday Jews and Arabs will one day share the land in peace. While others in turn add a shovelful of dirt to the grave, Dov, angry and heartbroken, bypasses the shovel and moves on. Ari, Kitty, Dov, and a Palmach contingent board trucks, heading off to the battle. Cast * Paul Newman as Ari Ben Canaan * Eva Marie Saint as Kitty Fremont * Ralph Richardson as Gen.

However, relations between the director and actors were difficult, particularly with the male lead, Paul Newman.Foster Hirsch, Otto Preminger: The Man Who Would Be King (New York: Knopf, 2007) After Newman's suggested changes to the script were rejected by Preminger, and the actor given a dressing down for making the suggestions, Newman hid a mannequin on a high balcony on which he was due to play out a fight scene. At the end of the scene, Newman pretended to stumble, and threw the mannequin over the balcony. Not realising this was a practical joke, Preminger collapsed and required medical attention. At other times, Preminger and Newman were barely on speaking terms.A. E. Hotchner, Paul and Me: 53 Years of Adventures and Misadventures with Paul Newman (London: Simon & Schuster, 2014) Although filming key elements of Exodus on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus was authentic, as it was the location of the British internment camps for Jewish refugees trying to reach Palestine, it was difficult, as the island was in the middle of a Greek insurgency against British rule, led by the Greek nationalist organisation EOKA. EOKA was considered a terrorist organisation by the British authorities in Cyprus, and they were opposed to the filming of a movie on the island that seemed to combine anti-British sentiments with a storyline that appeared to show terrorist action could be successful. As a result, the British military refused to help Preminger with the logistical side of filming. The only assistance given by the British authorities was the placing of an armed guard on the large number of decommissioned rifles used as props in the film, to prevent them falling into the hands of EOKA and being recommissioned.Tony Shaw, Cinematic Terror: A Global History of Terrorism on Film (London: Bloomsbury, 2014) p. 67 Reception Bosley Crowther of The New York Times described the film as a \\"dazzling, eye-filling, nerve-tingling display of a wide variety of individual and mass reactions to awesome challenges and, in some of its sharpest personal details, a fine reflection of experience that rips the heart.\\" The film's \\"principal weakness,\\" Crowther wrote, \\"is that it has so much churning around in it that no deep or solid stream of interest evolves—save a vague rooting interest in the survival of all the nice people involved.\\"Crowther, Bosley (December 16, 1960).

Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post stated that the film \\"has this vitality of the immediate and will be of incalculable influence in reaching those unfamiliar with the background of Israel ...

(March 5, 1961). \\"Fact Helps Fiction On Current Screen\\". The Washington Post. G1. The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"Exodus lacks the historical imagination to cope with its theme on one level, the human awareness to dramatise it on the other. At the end of three and a half hours, its approach remains more exhausting than exhaustive. And the determination to be fair to all sides—almost the only character the script is prepared to dislike is the Nazi leader of the Arab terrorists—produces some strange consequences.\\" Roger Angell of The New Yorker wrote, \\"Such a bubbling pot of intrigue, violence, and hatred would almost seem to guarantee a lively film, but Mr. Preminger has approached his task with a painstaking reverence that would have been more suitable if he had been filming the original work of this title. He permits nearly everyone in his large cast to state his ideological and political convictions before and after each new turn of events, and the result is an awesome talkfest that is all too rarely interrupted by the popping of rifles.\\"Angell, Roger (December 17, 1960). \\"The Current Cinema\\".

A version by Ferrante & Teicher made number 2 on the Billboard Singles Chart. Another version was recorded by jazz saxophonist Eddie Harris. Other versions were recorded by Mantovani, Grant Green, Manny Albam, Andy Williams, Peter Nero, Connie Francis, Quincy Jones, the 1960s British instrumental band the Eagles, and the Duprees, who sang the theme with lyrics written by Pat Boone. Other artists include gospel pianist Anthony Burger (in the Gaither Vocal Band's \\"I Do Believe\\"), singer Edith Piaf (who sang French lyrics), and classical pianist Maksim Mrvica. Davy Graham reinvented the main theme on his 1963 album The Guitar Player. Trey Spruance of the Secret Chiefs 3 re-scored the theme for \\"surf band and orchestra\\" on the album 2004 Book of Horizons. Howard Stern uses it for comedic effect when discussing aspects of Jewish life. A portion of the theme was covered live by '70s Southern Rock band Black Oak Arkansas, whose 3 lead guitarists used eBows to play the theme in harmony, embedded into a cover of the Buddy Holly song \\"Not Fade Away\\". Different samples of the Exodus theme have been used in several hip-hop songs, including Ice-T's song \\"Ice's Exodus\\" from the album The Seventh Deadly Sin, Nas's song \\"You're Da Man\\" from the album Stillmatic, and T.I.'s song \\"Bankhead\\" from the album King. A portion of the main title was included in a montage arranged by composer John Williams and performed at the 2002 Academy Awards ceremony. The artist Nina Paley used the entire theme song to satirical effect in her animated short, titled after the lyrics, \\"This Land is Mine\\" (2012), which depicts thousands of years of violent struggles to control the Holy Land. Although not in an official film soundtrack, a Chopin Nocturne was played while General Sutherland and Kitty Fremont discussed the future of Jews and Palestine.

Background Born on 5 April 1883, Tan was the third son of Tan Keong Ann (),Page 127, Who's Who in Malaya 1938 who had seven sons and daughters, and a fifth generation Peranakan-Hokkien Chinese Malaysian living at 111, Heeren Street () in Malacca.

Soon he was appointed visiting agent to Nyalas Rubber Estates in Malacca in 1909. In 1910, Tan was involved in the founding of three rubber companies. He started United Malacca Rubber Estate Ltd. himself, and he obtained the assistance of other businessmen to jointly set up Malacca Pinda Rubber Estates Ltd. and Ayer Molek Rubber Company, Ltd.Pages 2 and 3, Report on THE MALAYSIAN PLANTATION INDUSTRY, 1880–1921 by Boon Weng Siew, Vice chairman, MPOA & President, MEOA. Three years later in 1912, he was nominated as Malacca Council Commissioner and a Justice of the Peace for Malacca by the British government. Months later, he was also nominated as the Commissioner of the Town Council for the towns and Malacca port as well. In 1914, he resuscitated the Chinese Company of the Malacca Volunteer Corps (later also known as B Company, 4th Battalion, Straits Settlement Volunteer Force) and served as a private for five years until 1919.Page 19, Leaders of Malaya and Who's Who 1956. In 1915, the Straits Chinese British Association (SCBA) was revived by him, electing him as the President of SCBA soon after. In 1923, at the age of 40, he was appointed as a nominated member of the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements. In 1926, Tan made history with his monumental speech of ideals of a territorially and politically united Malaya in a speech to the council. Like many Straits-born Chinese of his time, Tan was partial towards Britain but was deeply influenced by ideas of independence which were sweeping across many British colonies. He advocated the concept of a \\"united self-governing British Malaya\\". From 1933 to 1935, he was an unofficial member of the Straits Settlements Executive Council. He championed social causes like opposing opium smoking, promoting Chinese vernacular education, legislating against polygamy and pressing for immigration policy reform. During the Japanese occupation of Malaya, Tan and his family lived in India in exile. They witnessed the struggles of Mahatma Gandhi and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru for independence during their stay in India, and inspired them to do the same for their motherland Malaya when they returned. The birth of Malayan Chinese Association Tan returned to Malacca after the Japanese surrendered. On 27 February 1949, Tun Tan founded the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA) alongside Tun Leong Yew Koh () and Colonel Lee Hau Shik. Although he was 66 when elected to the position, Tun Tan was regarded as the only man able to bring the Malayan Chinese together in perhaps their most trying time. The post-war years and the Emergency was a difficult and dangerous juncture for the community. The Chinese were deeply divided and their loyalty was under scrutiny. Among the Chinese, only Tan had the stature to engage with senior Malays such as Datuk Onn Jaafar and Tunku Abdul Rahman at a time of imminent constitutional changes in the country. Strongly anti- communist, he was also trusted by the British colonial officials. He joined the Malay leaders – first through the All-Malaya Council of Joint Action, which he chaired, and then the Communities Liaison Committee headed by Dato' Sir E. E. C. Thuraisingham – to fight for constitutional change and work towards inter-ethnic co-operation. The establishment of the Federation of Malaya did not go down well with the ethnic Chinese, whereby favourable conditions for obtaining citizenship for the Chinese and other non-Malays were withdrawn. The Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) was formed in 1949 under the leadership of Tan Cheng Lock who frequently raised grievances over the citizenship terms that were set when the Federation was established.Bayly, Harper, Forgotten wars: Freedom and Revolution in Southeast Asia, pg 502-3 As a result, communal tensions between the Malays and Chinese surfaced, and Onn Jaafar, who was then heading UMNO kept his distance from Tan. Tan encountered initial difficulties with meeting Sultan Ibrahim of Johor, who was not accustomed to working with Chinese businessmen. The goal for the foundation of the Malayan Chinese Association was to unite the Chinese population in Malaya, including the protection of the rights and interests of the Chinese, also to work with the colonial government to stop the spread of communism and to work with other races to achieve the independence of Malaya. The MCA branches had been set up after their campaigns had attracted more than 200,000 members. Soon later, on 26 September 1951, he had supported the idea of Onn Jaafar to form the Independence of Malaya Party (IMP) in Kuala Lumpur with co-operation of various races as her theme of struggle. However, the formation was choppy, which due to the fact that Dato' Onn Jaafar was not co-operative on the issue of citizenship. In the end, Tan decided that only a Chinese party could safeguard the interests of his community and that multi-ethnic co-operation was more likely to be achieved through partnership with UMNO. With that, the MCA joined with UMNO to form the Alliance, the precursor to the Barisan Nasional. However some people do not agree that he acted in best interest of Malaysian Chinese as some felt that the marginalization of Malaysian Chinese would not be so severe had the British ruled until now citing Hong Kong as an example. In 1952, Tan Cheng Lock and the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) under Tunku Rahman's leadership contested the election as partners.

Under Tan Cheng Lock, the MCA played a vital rôle in negotiating independence from the British; he was also in charge as the MCA formed the Alliance in 1954 in coalition with the United Malays National Organisation and the Malaysian Indian Congress. Tun Tan Cheng Lock, who was a member of the Malayan Anti- Japanese League, was MCA's first president, but did not enter the cabinet on independence because his rival, Tun H.S. Lee, from Selangor, was part of the cabinet. Prior to the independence of Malaya, he was also a member of the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements.

His son, Tan Siew Sin became the 3rd President of MCA after his death. Legacy Many tributes were made to Tun Tan, for his immense contribution to Malaysia. Besides being recognised as one of the founding fathers of modern-day Malaysia, along with Tunku Abdul Rahman, Tun Abdul Razak and Tun V.T. Sambanthan, the street named Foch Avenue, adjacent to the Petaling Street was renamed Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock in Kuala Lumpur after 1957. The former Cross Street was renamed Tan Siew Sin Street in honour of Tun Tan's son, a former Finance Minister of Malaysia. In Malacca, Heeren Street where Tun Tan's family home and the place of his birth was situated was also renamed Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock in his honour. In 2002, a school was built at Subang Jaya in the state of Selangor and was named SJKC Tun Tan Cheng Lock. In April 2005, the National University of Singapore (NUS) received a generous gift of S$4 million from Ms Agnes Tan, the last surviving daughter of Tun Tan Cheng Lock to acquire a Peranakan house on Neil Road in Singapore. Another donation of S$1.5 million was made for the purpose of acquiring two other houses on Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock in Malacca for the conservation and promotion of Peranakan architecture and culture in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. The house in Singapore was named the Tan Cheng Lock Baba House, in honour of Tun Tan's strong belief in education.

It is a general-purpose algorithm, meaning that it is suitable for factoring any integer n, not depending on special form or properties. It was described by D. H. Lehmer and R. E. Powers in 1931, and developed as a computer algorithm by Michael A. Morrison and John Brillhart in 1975. The continued fraction method is based on Dixon's factorization method. It uses convergents in the regular continued fraction expansion of :\\\\sqrt{kn},\\\\qquad k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z^+}. Since this is a quadratic irrational, the continued fraction must be periodic (unless n is square, in which case the factorization is obvious).

The term is a dysphemism, originating in the common usage of \\"Mickey Mouse\\" as a pejorative. It came to prominence in the UK after use by the country's national tabloids. Origins The term was used by education minister Margaret Hodge, during a discussion on higher education expansion.\\"'Irresponsible' Hodge under fire\\", BBC News, 14 January 2003. URL accessed 24 June 2006. Hodge defined a Mickey Mouse course as \\"one where the content is perhaps not as rigorous as one would expect and where the degree itself may not have huge relevance in the labour market\\"; and that, furthermore, \\"simply stacking up numbers on Mickey Mouse courses is not acceptable\\". This opinion is often raised in the summer when exam results are released and new university courses revealed. The phrase took off in the late 1990s, as the Labour government created the target of having 50% of students in higher education by 2010.\\"50% higher education target doomed, says thinktank\\", EducationGuardian.co.uk, 14 July 2005.

URL accessed 24 June 2006. A professor for the department stressed that the course would not focus on Beckham, and that the module examines \\"the rise of football from its folk origins in the 17th century, to the power it's become and the central place it occupies in British culture, and indeed world culture, today.\\" In July 2015, MEP Louise Bours referred to the module on Question Time, but as though it was a full degree course.

Durham University designed a module centred around Harry Potter to examine \\"prejudice, citizenship and bullying in modern society\\" as a part of a B.A. degree in Education Studies. One thing these courses share is that they are \\"vocational\\", which are perceived to be less intellectually rigorous than the traditional academic degrees. Defenders of these courses object that the derogatory comments made in the media rely on the low symbolic capital of new subjects and rarely discuss course contents beyond the titles. Another factor is the correct or incorrect perception that the take up of these subjects, and the decline of more traditional academic subjects like science, engineering, or mathematics,\\"A-level pupils urged to spurn 'soft' subjects\\", EducationGuardian.co.uk, 12 August 2005.

The real control over Russian diplomacy during his lengthy term in office was exercised by Boris Kurakin until 1727 and by Andrey Osterman after his death. In 1677, while still a young man, Gavrila Golovkin was attached to the court of the tsarevich Peter, with whose mother Nataliya he was connected, and vigilantly guarded him during the disquieting period of the regency of Sophia. He accompanied the young tsar abroad on his first foreign tour, and worked by his side in the dockyards of Zaandam. In 1706, he succeeded Golovin in the direction of foreign policy, and was created the first Russian grand-chancellor on the field of Poltava (1709). Golovkin held this office for twenty-five years. In the reign of Catherine I, he became a member of the Supreme Privy Council, which had the chief conduct of affairs during this and the succeeding reigns. The empress also entrusted him with her last will whereby she appointed the young Peter II her successor and Golovkin one of his guardians. On the death of Peter II in 1730, he declared openly in favour of Anna, duchess of Courland, in opposition to the aristocratic Dolgorukovs and Galitzines, and his determined attitude on behalf of autocracy was the chief cause of the failure of the proposed constitution, which would have converted Russia into a limited monarchy. Under Anna, he was a member of the first cabinet formed in Russia, but had less influence in affairs than Osterman and Munnich. In 1707, Golovkin was created a count of the Holy Roman Empire, and in 1710 a count of the Russian Empire. He was one of the wealthiest, and at the same time one of the stingiest, magnates of his day. His ignorance of any language but his own made his intercourse with foreign ministers very inconvenient. For the ultimate disgrace of his relatives, see the Lopukhina Affair. Yury Golovkin, Russia's first ambassador to China, was his great grandson.

Hamilton prepped at Louisiana State University Laboratory School in Baton Rouge and then attended Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana. Baseball career=Milwaukee Brewers Hamilton was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 11th round of the 1986 Major League Baseball draft and signed a contract with them on June 12, 1986. He made his professional debut that season with the Helena Gold Sox of the Rookie-level Pioneer League, hitting .391 in 65 games. In 1987 with the Stockton Ports of the Class A California League, he hit .328 in 125 games with eight homers and 61 RBI, on a team that was rated one of the top farm teams in Brewers history. He began 1988 with the Denver Zephyrs of the Class AAA American Association, where he hit .325 in 72 games. Hamilton made his MLB debut on June 3, 1988, as a defensive replacement for Robin Yount in the top of the seventh against the California Angels. In his first at-bat, in the bottom of the inning, he singled to center field off of Stew Cliburn of the Angels for his first major league hit. He hit his first home run off of Bret Saberhagen of the Kansas City Royals on July 19, 1988. In 44 games with the Brewers during the second half of the 1988 season, Hamilton hit .184. His most notable moment that season was during his first start in left field, on September 3, he collided with shortstop Dale Sveum while chasing a blooper over third base. They collided with such force that Sveum's leg snapped, causing him to miss the rest of the season and all of the 1989 season and derailing his career. Hamilton avoided injury but spent the entire 1989 season back in the minors with the Zephyrs, where he hit .286 in 129 games. In 1990, despite missing time with injuries, Hamilton played in 89 games and hit .295. He was awarded with the Brewers \\"Unsung Hero Award\\" in 1990 and the \\"Good Guy Award\\" in 1991 when he hit .311 in 122 games while still dealing with an assortment of injuries. Hamilton stole 41 bases for the Brewers in 1992, while hitting .298 in 128 games. The Brewers as a team stole 256 bases, which was almost 100 more than the second place American League (AL) team. In a game on August 28, 1992, the Brewers set an AL record by recording 31 hits in a single game in a 22–2 rout of the Toronto Blue Jays. Hamilton had four hits and five RBI in that game. When long-time Brewer star Paul Molitor left via free agency before the 1993 season, Hamilton became more important to the Brewers offense. He had some more injuries this season, but Hamilton still led his team in batting average (.310), hits (161), singles (130) and stolen bases (21) and was awarded with the team's \\"Harvey Kuenn Award.\\" The Brewers decision to move Hamilton from right field into center field for the 1994 season contributed to Hall of Famer Robin Yount's decision to retire after the 1993 season. In 1994, Hamilton played in only 36 games (hitting .262) before he was shut down for the season and underwent reconstructive elbow surgery. Despite missing most of the season, the Milwaukee chapter of the Baseball Writers Association voted him the recipient of the \\"Michael Harrison Award\\" for community service. Hamilton was also one of the Brewers player representatives during the leadup to the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. In his final season as a member of the Brewers, in 1995, Hamilton played in 112 games and hit .271 with 11 stolen bases. In his seven seasons with the team, he had an overall .290 batting average in 666 games and hit 23 home runs, drove in 253 RBI and stole 109 bases. After the 1995 season, the Brewers declined Hamilton's $2.5 million contract option, making him a free agent. Hamilton filed a grievance against the Brewers, claiming that he was benched in the weeks of the season in order to keep him from reading 550 plate appearances which would have automatically picked up the option. The grievance was resolved in an undisclosed negotiated settlement. Texas Rangers Hamilton signed with the Texas Rangers on a one-year, $1.3 million, contract on December 14, 1995, for the 1996 season. He was critical of the Brewers when he signed with the Rangers, saying they were not interested in building a winning team. Hamilton played in a career best 148 games with the Rangers and was their regular starting center fielder. He hit .293 with six homers and 51 RBI and also stole 15 bases. He described his experience with the Rangers as \\"great.\\" Hamilton did not make an error all season and led all center fielders in putouts as the Rangers put a premium on defense that season. The Rangers won the American League West division and the first playoff berth in franchise history. In the 1996 American League Division Series against the New York Yankees, Hamilton had three hits in 19 at-bats as the Rangers dropped the series three games to one . San Francisco Giants Hamilton signed a two-year contract with the San Francisco Giants on January 10, 1997. On June 12, he got the first hit in the first-ever regular-season interleague game, when the Giants defeated the Rangers 4-3. In 125 games, Hamilton had a .270 batting average, five homers, 43 RBI and 15 stolen bases. In the 1997 National League Division Series, Hamilton was hitless in five at- bats as the Giants were swept in three games by the eventual World Series champion Florida Marlins. He followed that up by playing in 97 games for the Giants in 1998 and hitting .294. Colorado Rockies The Giants traded Hamilton and Jim Stoops to the Colorado Rockies for Ellis Burks on July 31, 1998. Hamilton was surprised by the trade, wanting to complete his contract in San Francisco. In 51 games he hit .335. He re-signed with the Rockies after the 1998 season for one year and $3.6 million and played in 91 games in the 1999 season with an OBP of .374 for them. New York Mets Hamilton was traded to the New York Mets with Chuck McElroy for Rigo Beltrán, Brian McRae, and Thomas Johns on July 31, 1999. He played with the Mets through the 2001 season. In his three seasons with them he played in 150 games and hit .283. Hamilton and the Mets played in the post-season in both 1999 and 2000. In 1999, the Mets made the playoffs as a result of winning a one game playoff against the Cincinnati Reds. Once in, they defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 1999 National League Division Series before losing to the Atlanta Braves in six games in the National League Championship Series. Hamilton had six hits in 17 at-bats in that series. In 2000, the Mets defeated the San Francisco Giants in four games in the 2000 National League Division Series and the St. Louis Cardinals in five games in the 2000 National League Championship Series. Hamilton was a part-time player in the series, with only five at-bats in the division series and two in the championship series. In the 2000 World Series against the New York Yankees was hitless in three at-bats with two strikeouts as the Yankees won the series in five games. Hamilton was disappointed with his playing time during the playoffs and had a meeting with manager Bobby Valentine during spring training the following year to discuss his reduced playing time. Things did not improve for him and he asked for his release at the end of June, and it was granted on July 11, 2001. He signed a minor league contract with the Rockies a week later, but was released on July 25 after four games with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. He retired at the end of the 2001 season. Over his 13-year career, Hamilton batted .291, with 51 home runs and 454 RBI in 1328 games. As an outfielder, he collected 2711 putouts and 45 assists, committing only 14 errors in 2770 total chances, for a .995 fielding percentage. Player profile Hamilton was a notorious ground ball hitter, rarely struck out, drew a significant number of walks, and was a speedy runner who stole 41 bases in 1992 for the Brewers. He holds the American League records for consecutive errorless chances (541) and errorless games (229). Broadcasting career Hamilton worked for MLB Advanced Media from 2003 to 2006 and also worked for NBC Sports Network's \\"Sports Talk\\" and KPRC-TV in Houston. Also in Texas, Hamilton lent his voice to KFNC and KGOW. At the conclusion of the 2006 baseball postseason, Hamilton began working in the Major League Baseball Commissioner's Office of On-Field Operations, reporting to Vice President Bob Watson. In 2012 Hamilton was named as a color analyst for a limited series of Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim games to be broadcast nationally by Compass Media Networks radio and in 2013 he joined the MLB Network as an on-air analyst. In 2014 Hamilton served as a part-time color analyst on Brewers radio broadcasts, rotating with Craig Counsell and Jerry Augustine to call games with Joe Block when primary announcer Bob Uecker was absent. Personal life Darryl was married in 1994 to Access Hollywood anchor Shaun Robinson, but they divorced. Hamilton married fashion model Ursaline Steinke in 2000, with whom he had two sons, Donovan and Julian. At the time of his death, Darryl was living in an affluent neighborhood in suburb of Houston, Texas, in a house belonging to his girlfriend, Monica Jordan. Jordan, a graduate of Florida State University and University of Houston Law Center, was an attorney who had been employed by Enron and Halliburton. The couple had a son together in 2014. Death Around 4:45 p.m. on June 21, 2015, Hamilton, 50, and his girlfriend, Monica Jordan, 44, were found dead in their Pearland, Texas, house, in what appeared to be a murder-suicide. Investigators said it appeared Hamilton had been shot more than once and Jordan died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Hamilton and Jordan's 13 month-old child was found alive by police in the home and taken into the custody of Texas Child Protective Services. According to Pearland police, there did not appear to have been a struggle and the incident \\"occurred just inside the front door.\\" A third party called 9-1-1. According to Brazoria County District Attorney Jeri Yenne, Jordan previously pleaded guilty to felony arson arising from a 2008 incident in which she burned down the house in which she had been living with her then-husband Rohaven Richards. Jordan allegedly had suspected Richards of cheating on her and chased him around the house while trying to douse him in gasoline.

They are best remembered for the hit single and cult favourite \\"Starry Eyes\\". Music career The Records formed out of the ashes of the Kursaal Flyers, a pub rock group featuring drummer Will Birch. In 1977, John Wicks joined the band as a rhythm guitarist, and he and Birch quickly started writing songs together, Wicks as composer, Birch as lyricist. The Kursaal Flyers dissolved three months after Wicks joined, but he and Birch continued to write songs together with the hopes of starting a new four-piece group with Birch on drums and Wicks on lead vocals and rhythm guitar. Birch soon came up with a name for the formative band: The Records. The group's line-up initially included bassist Phil Brown and lead guitarist Brian Alterman, whose guitar riffs have been compared to that of the Byrds. Alterman played on two early demos that were later included on the album Paying for the Summer of Love, before joining another band. Alterman was replaced by Huw Gower in 1978. Like Birch and Wicks, Gower and Brown were music veterans: Gower had played with a band called the Ratbites from Hell and Brown had been the bass player for the Janets. The new group was heavily influenced both by British Invasion bands like The Beatles and The Kinks and early power pop groups such as Badfinger, Big Star, and Raspberries. Power pop was experiencing a renaissance on both sides of the Atlantic, thanks in large part to the burgeoning punk/new wave movement. They were hired to back Stiff Records singer Rachel Sweet on the \\"Be Stiff Tour '78\\". The Records opened the shows with a set of their own. Birch and Wicks also wrote a song for Sweet's debut album entitled \\"Pin a Medal on Mary\\". The songwriting duo also penned \\"Hearts in Her Eyes\\" for the Searchers, who made an unexpected comeback with their power pop oriented album The Searchers in 1979. Based on their demos (later released as Paying for the Summer of Love), the band was signed to Virgin Records in 1978. Their debut single, \\"Starry Eyes\\", was released in the UK that December and has since become their best-known song and an oft-covered power pop standard. Allmusic called it \\"a near-perfect song that defined British power pop in the '70s\\". Due in part to its clear influence by American power pop, the song was a bigger hit in the US than in the UK; it peaked at No. 56 on the Billboard Hot 100 in October 1979. Shades in Bed The group prepared their debut album with producers Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange and Tim Friese-Greene. Huw Gower produced \\"The Phone\\", which was added to the album in preference to one of Lange's efforts, a cover of Tim Moore's \\"Rock 'n' Roll Love Letter\\". The debut LP Shades in Bed yielded another single, \\"Teenarama\\", their second-best known song. The album was released in the US in July 1979 as The Records with different song sequencing and with the original single version of \\"Starry Eyes\\" replacing Lange's re-recording that appeared on the UK edition. The album was sufficiently well received to peak on the Billboard chart at No. 41\\\\. Gower also produced the bonus four track disc of cover tunes included in the album release, which also received FM airplay, notably the version of Spirit's \\"1984\\", which was strong enough to become short-listed by Virgin as the second single off the album. That was the pinnacle of their success. Returning to the UK, Will Birch engaged the services of producer Craig Leon to record two new songs and to remix two tracks from Shades in Bed for a possible single release. Huw Gower acted as co-producer. After an aborted German tour with Robert Palmer, Gower left the band and relocated to New York, where he joined forces with New York Dolls lead singer David Johansen. Their collaboration led to the successful album Live It Up. Crashes Jude Cole, a 19-year-old American, who had been in Moon Martin's backing group The Ravens, joined for the album Crashes (1980). The album was not a hit, and did not yield any successful singles, and record company support for the band dried up during the Crashes tour. Cole stayed in the US, while the core of Birch, Wicks and Brown returned home to England. Music on Both Sides The trio expanded into a quintet with guitarist Dave Whelan and lead singer Chris Gent. Previously, most of the songs had been sung by Wicks, but with other members frequently taking lead vocals for individual songs. Birch has since declared that the decision to recruit a lead singer was made \\"perhaps unwisely\\". This line-up recorded a third album for Virgin, 1982's Music on Both Sides. Like its predecessor, the album was not a hit. Breakup and aftermath After this, the band effectively broke up. Birch turned to tour managing, running 'Rock Tours', a sightseeing London Bus venture, producing and writing. In 1990 the original band briefly reformed to contribute a track for the 1991 Brian Wilson tribute album, Smiles, Vibes & Harmony. Birch, Brown and Wicks cut the basic track for \\"Darlin'\\" in London; Gower added his parts and mixed it in New York. The same year also saw the US release of Paying for the Summer of Love. Both recordings received great press, but were not enough to outweigh unresolved past issues within the core membership, which effectively killed any possibility of restarting the group. Wicks relocated to the US in 1994 and was writing, recording and performing both solo and with a new incarnation of the band up until 2018. Brown succumbed to an undisclosed degenerative illness on February 2, 2012. Wicks died following a year-long struggle with cancer on October 7, 2018 in Burbank, California.

The present day Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Jalan Tan Tock Seng in the hospital area are named after him. Overview Born in Malacca in 1798One Hundred Years' History of the Chinese in Singapore to an immigrant Hokkien father and Peranakan mother, Tan Tock Seng rose from humble origins. In 1819, Tan moved to Singapore to sell fruit, vegetable and fowl. He worked diligently and became a notable businessman. He was famous for contributing money to build a hospital called \\"Tan Tock Seng Hospital\\" as he saw many poor and sick people. Tan also owned large tracts of prime land, including 50 acres (200,000 m²) at the site of the railway station and another plot stretching from the Padang right up to High Street and Tank Road. His other assets were a block of shophouses, an orchard and a nutmeg plantation which he co-owned with his brother. In time, he became an influential Chinese leader and was the first Asian to be made a Justice of the Peace by Governor Butterworth. He was skillful at settling feuds among the Chinese and was accustomed to bear the expenses of burying poor Chinese. In 1844, he contributed $5,000 to the construction of the Tan Tock Seng Hospital on top of Pearl's Hill. The hospital was later shifted to Tan Tock Seng Road as the building at Pearl's Hill was too old and small to cater to enough patients. Tan also contributed money to the construction of the Taoist Thian Hock Keng Temple at Telok Ayer in 1842, the place of worship for the settlers from Fujian, China. Legacy Tan died in 1850 at the age of 52, after catching an unknown disease. He left his wife Lee Seo Neo who owned a large coconut estate in Geylang. Like him, she was unstinting in her support of the hospital and paid for a female ward. He also left behind three daughters, who were each bequeathed S$36,000 in cash. One of his daughters married Lee Cheng Tee, at one time Chief Partner of Cheng-Tee Watt-Seng & Co., shipowners. His three sons (Tan Kim Ching, Tan Teck Guan and Tan Swee Lim) inherited his land parcels and the eldest, Tan Kim Ching, took over the duty of taking care of the hospital. Tan's grandson, Tan Chay Yan, was a well-known philanthropist and merchant in Malaya...

He was also known as a satirical writer who ridiculed Francophiles.Fyodor Rostopchin (1992). Oh, Those French! — Moscow: Russkaya kniga, 336 pages Biography Rostopchin Mansion in Moscow Rostopchin was born in the Kosmodemyanskoe village (modern-day Livensky District, Oryol Oblast of Russia) into a Russian noble family, the son of Vasily Fyodorovich Rostopchin (1733—1802), a landlord and former army major, and Nadezhda Aleksandrovna Rostopchina (née Kryukova) who died shortly after giving birth to his younger brother Peter. Rostopchin's date and place of birth, as well as his family roots are still questioned by biographers. While the date 12 March 1763 is written on his tombstone, other sources, including Rostopchin himself, pointed at 1765 as the real year and Moscow — as the real place of his birth.Arina Mescheryakova (2007).

December 7, 1799 (in Russian)Rostopchins article from Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, 1890—1907 (in Russian) His descendants supposedly served in Moscow, Tver, Klin and Rzhev at various army and state positions, yet none of them left any trace in Russian history, and some modern historians consider it to be a mystification. He spent most of his childhood and youth at his father's family estate in the Kosmodemyanskoe village where he received home education. He was fluent in English, German, French and Italian languages, and from 1786 to 1788 he traveled to Europe. This trip, especially the time spent in Berlin, influenced his later views and his passion for self- education. He described it in his first book The Trip to Prussia (1792-1794) which has been compared to the Letters of a Russian Traveller by Nikolay Karamzin. Feodor Rostopchin started his military career as a member of the Preobrazhensky Regiment in 1775, and in 1785 he was promoted to Podporuchik. He took part in the Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790) and the Russo-Turkish War (1788–1791). During the Russo-Swedish War he lost his younger brother Peter Rostopchin whom he later described in his patriotic novel Oh, Those French! He served under Alexander Suvorov who distinguished him. They became good friends, and Rostophin later defended Suvorov during his exile and was near him during his death. Rostopchin had great influence over Paul I of Russia. In 1796 he was appointed adjutant general, grand-marshal of the court, and in 1799 — the President of the Collegium of Foreign Affairs. Same year he was granted the title of Count. His opposition to the French alliance and the murder of Paul I in 1801 resulted in his falling out of favor. He spent 10 years living in his family estate and writing comedies and satirical novels. He was restored to favor in 1810 as conditions between France and Russia began to deteriorate. Shortly thereafter he was appointed a Governor-General of Moscow. During the French invasion of Russia he was responsible for the defence of the city against Napoleon, and he took every means available to rouse the population of the town and district to arm and join the army to defend the city against the invaders. After the Battle of Borodino it was clear that the French could not be denied the city. Rostopchin had the city evacuated, including all the city administrators and officials, leaving behind only a few French tutors, foreign shop keepers and those that were the lowest class of society.Caulaincourt p. 112 In addition, the prisons were opened and the prisoners set free by his order. No one met the Emperor Napoleon when he arrived at the city gates on 14 September. On the first night of French occupation a fire broke out in the bazaar and a number of small fires erupted in other quarters, but these were thought to be due to accident.Caulaincourt p. 114 The following day as Napoleon rode through the streets to the Kremlin he found the streets deserted.Caulaincourt p. 115 That night the city began to burn in earnest. Rostopchin had left a small detachment of police, whom he charged with burning the city to the ground. Houses were prepared with flammable materials. The city's fire-engines were disassembled. Fuses were left throughout the city to ignite the fires.Caulaincourt p. 119 Years later he claimed innocence against the charge of arson, and had a pamphlet printed and distributed in Paris proclaiming so in 1823, but subsequently admitted to his role in ordering the city's destruction. He was disgraced shortly after the Congress of Vienna, to which he had accompanied Tsar Alexander I. He returned to Russia in 1825 and died in Moscow in February of the next year suffering from asthma and hemorrhoid complications. He was buried at the Pyatnitskoye Cemetery. He married Ekaterina Petrovna Protassova (1775–1869), and had eight children. Among them: * Count Sergei Fyodorovich Rostopchin; * Countess Natalya Fyodorovna Rostopchine; * Countess Sofiya Fyodorovna Rostopchine, who became a noted French novelist under the title of comtesse de Ségur; * Countess Lise Fyodorovna Rostopchine; * Count Andrei Fyodorovich Rostopchine, married Yevdokiya Petrovna Sushkova. He appears as a character in Leo Tolstoy's 1869 novel War and Peace, in which he is presented very unfavorably.

Originally appearing in the ReBirth software synthesizer in 1998, the protocol has since evolved into an industry standard. Reason Studios has announced that they will discontinue the Rewire protocol end of 2020. Currently used in macOS and Microsoft Windows 32-bit or 64-bit audio applications, ReWire enables the simultaneous transfer of up to 256 audio tracks of arbitrary resolution and 4080 channels of MIDI data. This allows, for example, the output from synthesizer software to be fed directly into a linear editor without the use of intermediate files or analog transfers. There are also provisions to remotely trigger actions, such as starting and stopping recording. The protocol is licensed free of charge to companies only, but comes with a \\"non-disclosure of source code\\" license that is incompatible with most free-software licenses. The ReWire system consists of \\"Hosts\\", \\"Panels\\", and \\"Devices\\". Hosts are the host applications which typically do the sequencing at one end and the final mixdown at the other end. A Device is a dynamic link library that only generates sound; it has no user interface. A Panel is a graphical interface for setting the parameters of one Device. A typical setup would be to use Ableton Live in \\"Host\\" mode, and use Propellerhead Reason as a synthesizer. In this case Reason would provide Device/Panel pairs to Ableton, which could then send midi commands, sync timing and mix Reason's output into its own effects chains. Many applications support either mode. In fact, an application could (at the discretion of a developer) act as both a Host and a Panel at the same time.

Originally built in the 1960s, the interchange underwent a total rebuild between 2004 and 2008, and was officially opened on August 19, 2008, after what was at the time the largest construction project in state history. During the early 2000s, U.S. Highway 41 (US 41) had followed I-94 through the interchange. This had changed when I-41 was designated in the Milwaukee area. US 41 now follows I-41 through the area.  History  The history of the Marquette Interchange, originally called the Central Interchange, stretches back more than half a century. The idea of a north–south freeway with an interchange in downtown Milwaukee was first proposed in 1952 for an area south and east of Marquette University. An artist's sketch in a local newspaper in December 1952 provided a first glimpse of the future. The following year, the Milwaukee County Expressway Commission was created by state law to plan, design, construct and maintain a freeway system in Milwaukee County. Land acquisition soon began. In 1955, the Milwaukee County Board adopted A General Plan of Expressways for Milwaukee County, which included a downtown interchange near the present location of the Marquette Interchange. All of this activity in Milwaukee was in no way unique. Many cities across the United States were drawing up plans for new freeways during the mid-1950s. Nationally, there were big plans, too. In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, creating the United States' modern Interstate Highway System. Preliminary design on the Marquette Interchange began in 1956, and final design began in 1960. In 1964, construction began, and so did a difficult balancing act. For the next years, traffic flow on city streets had to be maintained while new expressways and the new interchange were built in their midst. Bypasses and temporary street connections were used extensively to route heavy volumes of traffic around construction areas. Between 1964 and 1968, 21 construction contracts totaling over $33 million were awarded. The Marquette Interchange was dedicated and opened to traffic on December 23, 1968. The interchange was, and still is in its rebuilt form, one of downtown Milwaukee’s most prominent architectural landmarks. In the years to follow, millions of motorists would come to know the interchange as part of their route to work, around town or across the state. The Marquette Interchange has no affiliation with Marquette University, to which it is adjacent. Marquette University officials like to joke about how the university receives complaints from disgruntled motorists who erroneously believe the interchange is owned by the university. By the 2000s, the interchange was experiencing severe deterioration and traffic problems due to major design flaws, including poorly designed left exits and vehicles having to weave across travel lanes to reach exit ramps, causing accidents and bottlenecks.  The new interchange  Interchange in 2015 The junction underwent a complete reconstruction dubbed the Marquette Interchange Project between 2004 and 2008, and was officially opened on August 19, 2008, several weeks ahead of schedule. At a cost of less than $810 million, which was well below the projected $1 billion price tag, the project involved 46 cranes and more than 4,000 workers in what was at the time the largest construction project in state history. The project rebuilt the viaduct section of I-794 between the interchange and the Milwaukee River, I-43 from the interchange to North Avenue (including the bridges carrying city streets that spanned the freeway), the Hillside Interchange that connected I-43 to Highway 145, and I-94 from the interchange to 26th Street (including rebuilding the north end of the 16th Street Viaduct, officially known as the James E. Groppi Unity Bridge). The project also demolished the Milwaukee County Courthouse Annex parking structure that stood over the northbound lanes of I-43 just north of the interchange. The new Marquette Interchange was designed to ensure the safe and efficient flow of traffic. Though the new interchange occupies the same amount of land as the old one, it feels much more spacious. Design features include: * Two lane ramps in both directions between I-94 and I-43; * More gradual curves on ramps, with longer sight distances; * More distance between ramps, to eliminate traffic conflicts from lane changes; * Elimination of all left-hand entrances and exits; and * Design features allow for future expansion to an eight-lane freeway.

On August 24, 1814, after defeating the Americans at the Battle of Bladensburg, a British force led by Major General Robert Ross set fire to multiple government and military buildings, including the White House (then called the Presidential Mansion), the Capitol building, as well as other facilities of the U.S. government. The attack was in part a retaliation for the recent American destruction of Port Dover in Upper Canada. The Burning of Washington marks the only time since the American Revolutionary War that a foreign power has captured and occupied the capital of the United States. President James Madison, military officials, and his government fled the city in the wake of the British victory at Bladensburg. They eventually found refuge for the night in Brookeville, a small town in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is known today as the \\"United States Capital for a Day\\". President Madison spent the night in the house of Caleb Bentley, a Quaker who lived and worked in Brookeville. Bentley's house, known today as the Madison House, still exists. Less than a day after the attack began, a sudden, very heavy thunderstorm—possibly a hurricane—put out the fires. It also spun off a tornado that passed through the center of the capital, setting down on Constitution Avenue and lifting two cannons before dropping them several yards away. Following the storm, the British returned to their ships, many of which required repairs due to the storm. The occupation of Washington lasted for roughly 26 hours and the British plans are still a subject of debate.  Reasons  The British government, already at war with Napoleonic France, adopted a defensive strategy against the United States when the Americans declared war in 1812. Reinforcements were held back from Canada and reliance was instead made on local militias and native allies to bolster the British Army in Canada. However, after the defeat and exile of Napoleon Bonaparte in April 1814, Britain was able to use its now available troops and ships to prosecute its war with the United States. The Earl of Bathurst, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, dispatched an army brigade and additional naval vessels to Bermuda, from where a blockade of the US coast and even the occupation of some coastal islands had been overseen throughout the war. It was decided to use these forces in raids along the Atlantic seaboard to draw American forces away from Canada. The commanders were under strict orders, however, not to carry out operations far inland, or to attempt to hold territory. Early in 1814, Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy's North America and West Indies Station, controlling naval forces based at the new Bermuda dockyard and the Halifax Naval Yard which were used to blockade US Atlantic ports throughout the war. He planned to carry the war into the United States by attacks in Virginia and against New Orleans. Admiralty House, Mount Wyndham, Bermuda, where the attack was planned Rear Admiral George Cockburn had commanded the squadron in Chesapeake Bay since the previous year. On June 25, he wrote to Cochrane stressing that the defenses there were weak, and he felt that several major cities were vulnerable to attack. Cochrane suggested attacking Baltimore, Washington, and Philadelphia. On July 17, Cockburn recommended Washington as the target, because of the comparative ease of attacking the national capital and \\"the greater political effect likely to result\\". General Ross commanded a 4,500-man army, composed of the 4th (King's Own) Regiment of Foot, 21st (Royal North British Fusilier) Regiment of Foot, 44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot, and 85th Regiment of Foot. An added motive was retaliation for what Britain saw as the \\"wanton destruction of private property along the north shores of Lake Erie\\" by American forces under Col. John Campbell in May, the most notable being the Raid on Port Dover. On June 2, Sir George Prévost, Governor General of The Canadas, wrote to Cochrane at Admiralty House, in Bailey's Bay, Bermuda, calling for a retaliation against the American destruction of private property in violation of the laws of war. Prévost argued that, > ... in consequence of the late disgraceful conduct of the American troops in > the wanton destruction of private property on the north shores of Lake Erie, > in order that if the war with the United States continues you may, should > you judge it advisable, assist in inflicting that measure of retaliation > which shall deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages. On July 18, Cochrane ordered Cockburn to \\"deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages ... You are hereby required and directed to destroy and lay waste such towns and districts as you may find assailable\\". Cochrane instructed, \\"You will spare merely the lives of the unarmed inhabitants of the United States\\". Ross and Cockburn surveyed the torching of the President's Mansion, during which time a great storm arose unexpectedly out of the southeast. They were confronted a number of times while on horseback by older women from around Washington City and elderly clergymen (Southern Presbyterian and Southern Baptist), with women and children who had been hiding in homes and churches. They requested protection from abuse and robbery by enlisted personnel from the British Expeditionary Forces whom they accused of having tried to ransack private homes and other buildings. Major-General Ross had two British soldiers put in chains for violation of his general order. Throughout the events of that day, a severe storm blew into the city, worsening on the night of August 24, 1814.  Events  Burning of Washington August 1814 President James Madison, members of his government, and the military fled the city in the wake of the British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg. They eventually found refuge for the night in Brookeville, a small town in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is known today as the \\"United States' Capital for a Day.\\" President Madison spent the night in the house of Caleb Bentley, a Quaker who lived and worked in Brookeville. Bentley's house, known today as the Madison House, still stands in Brookeville. The sappers and miners of the Corps of Royal Engineers under Captain Blanshard were employed in burning the principal buildings. Blanshard reported that it seemed that the American President was so sure that the attacking force would be made prisoners that a handsome entertainment had been prepared. Blanshard and his sappers enjoyed the feast.  U.S. Capitol  The United States Capitol after the burning of Washington, D.C. in the War of 1812. Watercolor and ink depiction from 1814, restored. The Capitol was, according to some contemporary travelers, the only building in Washington \\"worthy to be noticed.\\" Thus, it was a prime target for the British invaders, both for its aesthetic and symbolic value. Upon arrival into the city via Maryland Avenue, the British targeted the Capitol (first the southern wing, containing the House of Representatives, then the northern wing, containing the Senate). Prior to setting it aflame, the British looted the building (which at that time housed Congress, the Library of Congress, and the Supreme Court). Items looted by Admiral Cockburn included a ledger entitled \\"An account of the receipts and expenditures of the United States for the year 1810\\"; the admiral wrote on the inside leaf that it was \\"taken in President's room in the Capitol, at the destruction of that building by the British, on the capture of Washington, 24th August, 1814\\". He later gave it to his elder brother Sir James Cockburn, 9th Baronet, the Governor of Bermuda. The book was eventually returned to the Library of Congress in 1940. The British intended to burn the building to the ground. They set fire to the southern wing first. The flames grew so quickly that the British were prevented from collecting enough wood to burn the stone walls completely. However, the Library of Congress's contents in the northern wing contributed to the flames on that side. Among the items destroyed was the 3,000-volume collection of the Library of Congress and the intricate decorations of the neoclassical columns, pediments, and sculptures. Later, former president Thomas Jefferson donated his personal book collection to start a new Library of Congress, originally designed by William Thornton in 1793 and Benjamin Latrobe in 1803. The wooden ceilings and floors burned, and the glass skylights melted because of the intense heat. The building was not a complete loss though; the House rotunda, the east lobby, the staircases, and Latrobe's famous Corn-Cob Columns in the Senate entrance hall all survived. The Superintendent of the Public Buildings of the City of Washington, Thomas Munroe, concluded that the loss to the Capitol amounted to $787,163.28, with $457,388.36 for the North wing and main building, and $329,774.92 for the South wing.  White House  The White House ruins after the conflagration of August 24, 1814. Watercolor by George Munger, displayed at the White House. After burning the Capitol, the British turned northwest up Pennsylvania Avenue toward the White House. After US government officials and President Madison fled the city, the First Lady Dolley Madison received a letter from her husband, urging her to be prepared to leave Washington at a moment's notice. Dolley organized the slaves and staff to save valuables from the British.Willets includes Dolley Madison's letter to her sister describing these events. James Madison's personal slave, the fifteen-year-old boy Paul Jennings, was an eyewitness. After later buying his freedom from the widow Dolley Madison, Jennings published his memoir in 1865, considered the first from the White House: Major-General Robert Ross, British commander who led the attack on Washington Jennings said the people who saved the painting and removed the objects actually were: The soldiers burned the president's house, and fuel was added to the fires that night to ensure they would continue burning into the next day. In 2009, President Barack Obama held a ceremony at the White House to honor Jennings as a representative of his contributions to saving the Gilbert Stuart painting and other valuables. (The painting that was saved was a copy Stuart made of the painting, not the original, although it is the same one on display in the East Room.) \\"A dozen descendants of Jennings came to Washington, to visit the White House. They looked at the painting their relative helped save.\\" In an interview with National Public Radio, Jennings' great-great-grandson Hugh Alexander said, \\"We were able to take a family portrait in front of the painting, which was for me one of the high points.\\" He confirmed that Jennings later purchased his freedom from the widowed Dolley Madison.  Other Washington properties  Portrait of Admiral Cockburn at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, with Washington burning in the background. The U.S. Capitol and Treasury Building are at far right. The day after the destruction of the White House, Rear Admiral Cockburn entered the building of the D.C. newspaper, the National Intelligencer, intending to burn it down. However, several women persuaded him not to because they were afraid the fire would spread to their neighboring houses. Cockburn wanted to destroy the newspaper because its reporters had written so negatively about him, branding him \\"The Ruffian\\". Instead, he ordered his troops to tear the building down brick by brick, and ordered all the \\"C\\" type destroyed \\"so that the rascals can have no further means of abusing my name\\". The US Treasury Building (built 1804) The Blodget Hotel which housed the US Patent Office; spared during the burning of Washington in 1814. The Patent Office later burned in 1836. The Washington Navy Yard in 1862 The British sought out the United States Treasury in hopes of finding money or items of worth, but they found only old records. They burned the United States Treasury and other public buildings. The United States Department of War building was also burned. However, the War and State Department files had been removed, so the books and records had been saved; the only records of the War Department lost were recommendations of appointments for the Army and letters received from seven years earlier. The First U.S. Patent Office Building was saved by the efforts of William Thornton, the former Architect of the Capitol and then the Superintendent of Patents, who gained British cooperation to preserve it. It is written that a loaded cannon was aimed at the Patent Office to destroy it. Thornton \\"put himself before the gun, and in a frenzy of excitement exclaimed: 'Are you Englishmen or only Goths and Vandals? This is the Patent Office, a depository of the ingenuity of the American nation, in which the whole civilized world is interested. Would you destroy it? If so, fire away, and let the charge pass through my body.' The effect is said to have been magical upon the soldiers, and to have saved the Patent Office from destruction.\\" \\"When the smoke cleared from the dreadful attack, the Patent Office was the only Government building ... left untouched\\" in Washington. The Americans had already burned much of the historic Washington Navy Yard, founded by Thomas Jefferson, to prevent capture of stores and ammunition,Crawford, p222, quoting letter from Cockburn to Cochrane dated August 27, 1814 'The Enemy himself, on our entering the Town set fire to ... ' as well as the 44-gun frigate USS Columbia and the 22 gun USS Argus, both new vessels nearing completion. The Navy Yard's Latrobe Gate, Quarters A, and Quarters B were the only buildings to escape destruction.\\"It is one of the few structures to have escaped the fire in 1814 when the British invaded Washington.\\" \\"When the British captured Washington on August 24, 1814, and Captain Tingey ordered the Navy Yard set fire to prevent the British using the Yard and its ships to their advantage, both Quarters A (Tingey's House) and Quarters B (Lieutenant Haraden's House) were untouched, but the people the neighborhood plundered them to such an extent that 'not a movable object from cellar to garret was left, and even the fixtures and locks off the doors were taken.\\" Also spared were the Marine Barracks and Commandant's House, although several private properties were damaged or destroyed.\\"Act of July 14, 1832, to pay estate of Edward Barry $568.35 for property destroyed in the burning of the Washington navy-hard by the British in 1814 ... Act of March 2, 1833, to pay the estate of George Hodge $824.18 for property destroyed in the burning of the Washington navy-yard by the British in 1814.\\" In the afternoon of August 25, General Ross sent two hundred men to secure a fort on Greenleaf's Point. The fort, later known as Fort McNair, had already been destroyed by the Americans, but 150 barrels of gunpowder remained. While the British were trying to destroy it by dropping the barrels into a well, the powder ignited. As many as thirty men were killed in the explosion, and many others were maimed.  \\"The Storm that Saved Washington\\"  Less than 4 days after the attack began, a sudden, very heavy thunderstorm—possibly a hurricane—put out the fires. It also spun off a tornado that passed through the center of the capital, setting down on Constitution AvenueThe War of 1812, Scene 5 \\"An Act of Nature\\", History Channel, 2005 and lifting two cannons before dropping them several yards away and killing British troops and American civilians alike. Following the storm, the British troops returned to their ships, many of which were badly damaged. There is some debate regarding the effect of this storm on the occupation. While some assert that the storm forced their retreat, it seems likely from their destructive and arsonous actions before the storm, and their written orders from Cochrane to \\"destroy and lay waste\\",Cruikshank 2006, p. 414. that their intention was merely to raze the city, rather than occupy it for an extended period. Whatever the case, the British occupation of Washington lasted only about 26 hours. Despite this, the \\"Storm that saved Washington\\", as it became known, did the opposite according to some. The rains sizzled and cracked the already charred walls of the White House and ripped away at structures the British had no plans to destroy (such as the Patent Office). The storm may have exacerbated an already dire situation for Washington D.C. An encounter was noted between Sir George Cockburn and a female resident of Washington. \\"Dear God! Is this the weather to which you are accustomed in this infernal country?\\" enquired the Admiral. \\"This is a special interposition of Providence to drive our enemies from our city\\", the woman allegedly called out to Cockburn. \\"Not so, Madam\\", Cockburn retorted. \\"It is rather to aid your enemies in the destruction of your city\\", before riding off on horseback.Peter Snow \\"When Britain Burned the White House\\" 2012 Yet, the British left right after the storm completely unopposed by any American military forces. What makes this event even more serendipitous for the Americans is that, as the Smithsonian reports, there have only been seven other tornadoes recorded in Washington, D.C. in the 204 years since with probably a similar rare occurrence in the years prior to this event. The Royal Navy reported that it lost one man killed and six wounded in the attack, of whom the fatality and three of the wounded were from the Corps of Colonial Marines. The destruction of the Capitol, including the Senate House and the House of Representatives, the Arsenal, Dockyard, Treasury, War Office, President's mansion, bridge over the Potomac, a frigate and a sloop together with all Materiel was estimated at £365,000. A separate British force captured Alexandria, on the south side of the Potomac River, while Ross's troops were leaving Washington. The mayor of Alexandria made a deal and the British refrained from burning the town. President Madison returned to Washington by September 1, on which date he issued a proclamation calling on citizens to defend the District of Columbia. Congress returned and assembled in special session on September 19. Due to the destruction of the Capitol and other public buildings, they initially met in the Post and Patent Office building. In 2013, an episode of the Weather Channel documentary series When Weather Changed History, entitled \\"The Thunderstorm That Saved D.C.\\", was devoted to these events.  Aftermath  Most contemporary American observers, including newspapers representing anti-war Federalists, condemned the destruction of the public buildings as needless vandalism. Many in the British public were shocked by the burning of the Capitol and other buildings at Washington; such actions were denounced by most leaders of continental Europe, where capital cities had been repeatedly occupied in the course of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars but always spared destruction (at least on the part of the occupiers – the famous burning of Moscow that occurred less than two years prior had been an act carried out by the defenders). According to The Annual Register, the burning had \\"brought a heavy censure on the British character\\", with some members of Parliament, including the anti-establishment MP Samuel Whitbread, joining in the criticism. The majority of British opinion believed that the burnings were justified following the damage that United States forces had done with its incursions into Canada. In addition, they noted that the United States had been the aggressor, declaring war and initiating it. Several commentators regarded the damages as just revenge for the American destruction of the Parliament buildings and other public buildings in York, the provincial capital of Upper Canada, early in 1813. Sir George Prévost wrote that \\"as a just retribution, the proud capital at Washington has experienced a similar fate\\". The Reverend John Strachan, who as Rector of York had witnessed the American acts there, wrote to Thomas Jefferson that the damage to Washington \\"was a small retaliation after redress had been refused for burnings and depredations, not only of public but private property, committed by them in Canada\\". When they ultimately returned to Bermuda, the British forces took with them two pairs of portraits of King George III and his wife, Queen Charlotte, which had been discovered in one of the public buildings. One pair currently hangs in the House of Assembly of the Parliament of Bermuda, and the other in the Cabinet Building, both in the city of Hamilton.POTSI (archived): HM Queen Elizabeth addresses the colonial Parliament in 1976  Reconstruction  The Old Brick Capitol serving as a prison during the Civil War Although the President and military officers returned to Washington only a few days after the British left, Congress did not return for three and half weeks. The Thirteenth Congress officially convened on September 19, at the Blodgett's Hotel, one of the few surviving buildings large enough to hold all members. The Blodgett's Hotel also housed the U.S. Patent Office. Although the British had destroyed all public buildings, the Blodgett's Hotel and U.S. Patent Office were spared. It was in this building that Congress met between September and December 1815 (when construction of the Old Brick Capitol was complete). There was a movement in Congress to relocate the capital after the burning. Congressmen from the North pushed for relocation to Philadelphia or other prominent northern cities, while Southern congressmen claimed that moving the capital would degrade the American sense of dignity and strength (however, many southern congressmen simply did not want to move the capital north of the Mason–Dixon line). On September 21, the House of Representatives voted to strike down a proposal to relocate the capital from Washington, D.C. by a margin of 83 to 54. On February 3, 1815, in an effort to guarantee that the federal government would always remain in the area, Washington property owners funded the building of the Old Brick Capitol, a larger meeting space where the Supreme Court now stands. Construction of the Old Brick Capitol cost $25,000 and was funded primarily through the sale of stocks. The largest donor was Daniel Carroll of Duddington, a rich English property owner in the area. Construction began on July 4, and concluded in December. Congress met in the Old Brick Capitol between December 1815 and December 1819, when the Capitol reopened. The Capitol reconstruction took much longer than anticipated. The Old Brick Capitol took only five months to complete; the Capitol took twelve years. A committee appointed by Congress to investigate the damage to the District concluded that it was cheaper to rebuild the already existing and damaged buildings than to build an entirely new one. On February 13, President Madison and Congress passed legislation to borrow $500,000 to repair the public buildings, including the Capitol, \\"on their present sites in the city of Washington\\". Benjamin Latrobe, architect of the Capitol who took over for William Thornton in 1803, was rehired to repair the building on April 18. He immediately requested 60,000 feet of boards, 500 tons of stone, 1,000 barrels of lime, and brick. With the $500,000 borrowed from Washington banks, Latrobe was able to rebuild the two wings and the central dome before being fired in 1818 for being difficult. Charles Bulfinch took over and officially completed the renovations by 1826. Bulfinch modified Latrobe's design by increasing the height of the Capitol dome to match the diameter of 86 ft. With the reconstruction of the public buildings in Washington, the value of land in the area increased dramatically, paving the way for the expansion of the city that developed in the years leading up to the American Civil War.

Canada Bay is also a bay on Parramatta River between Concord and Five Dock. The suburb of Canada Bay sits on the southern shore and is bordered by the suburbs of Burwood and Croydon. The City of Canada Bay takes its name from the bay but its administrative centre is located in the suburb of Drummoyne.  History  The name Canada Bay honours a link between Australia and Canada. Following the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837 to 1838, two Irish and 58 French Canadian rebels were deported to Australia. At the request of the local Catholic bishop, they were brought to Sydney. Imprisoned at Longbottom Stockade (which was located at what is now Concord Oval), the convicts broke stone for the construction of Parramatta Road and collected oyster shells for making lime. In 1842, the French Canadians were allowed to work outside the prison. Between 1843 and 1844, all received pardons and, except for two people who died and one (Joseph Marceau) who settled in Dapto all returned to Canada. After the rebellions, John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham, Governor General and Lord High Commissioner to British North America recommended that Britain grant responsible self-government to the Union of Upper and Lower Canada. Many parts of Canada Bay are a reminder of this history: Exile Bay, France Bay, Durham Street, Marceau Drive, Polding Street and Gipps Street. Bayview Park has a plaque that honours the exiles and marks the point of disembarkation. The City of Canada Bay was formed in December 2000, by the merger of Concord and Drummoyne councils. Demographics According to the 2016 census, there were 1,238 residents in Canada Bay. 63.8% of people were born in Australia. 59.6% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Italian at 13.6%. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 42.1%, No Religion, so described 22.2% and Anglican 8.8%.

He was born at Innsbruck. After studying law in his native town, and attaining the rank of captain in the Tirolese Landwehr, the young man, who had the advantage of being the grandson of Joseph von Hormayr (1705–1778), chancellor of Tirol, obtained a post in the foreign office at Vienna (1801), from which he rose in 1803 to be court secretary and, being a near friend of the Archduke Johann of Austria, director of the secret archives of the state and court for thirteen months. In 1803 he married Therese Anderler von Hohenwald. During the insurrection of 1809, by which the Tirolese sought to throw off the Bavarian supremacy confirmed by the treaty of Pressburg, Hormayr was the mainstay of the Austrian party, and assumed the administration of everything (especially the composition of proclamations and pamphlets); but, returning home without the prestige of success, he fell, in spite of the help of the Archduke John, into disfavour both with the emperor Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor and with Prince Metternich, and at length, when in 1813 he tried to stir up a new insurrection in Tirol, he was arrested and imprisoned at Mukachevo. In 1816, some amends were made to him by his appointment as imperial historiographer; but so little was he satisfied with the general policy and conduct of the Austrian court that in 1828 he accepted an invitation of King Louis I to the Bavarian capital, where he became ministerial councilor in the department of foreign affairs. In 1832 he was appointed Bavarian minister-resident at Hanover, and from 1837 to 1846 he held the same position at Bremen. Together with Count Johann Friedrich von der Decken (1769–1840) he founded the Historical Society of Lower Saxony (Historischer Verein für Niedersachsen). The last two years of his life were spent at Munich as superintendent of the national archives. Death He died in October 1848 of unknown causes, aged 66 or 67. Posthumous assessment Hormayr's literary activity was closely conditioned by the circumstances of his political career and by the fact that Johannes von Müller (died 1811) was his teacher: while his access to original documents gave value to his treatment of the past, his record or criticism of contemporary events received authority and interest from his personal experience. But his history of the Tirolese rebellion is far from being impartial; for he always liked to put himself into the first place, and the merits of Andreas Hofer and of other leaders are not sufficiently acknowledged. In his later writings he appears as a keen opponent of the policy of the court of Vienna. Works The following are among Hormayr's more important works: *Geschichte des Grafen von Andechs (1796) *Lexikon für Reisenden in Tirol (1796) *Kritisch-diplomatische Beiträge zur Geschichte Tirols im Mittelalter (2 vols., Innsbruck, 1802–1803, new ed., 1805) *Geschichte der gefürsteten Grafschaft Tirol (2 vols., Tübingen, 1806–1808); *Österreichischer Plutarch, 20 vols., collection of portraits and biographies of the most celebrated administrators, commanders and statesmen of Austria (Vienna. 1807) *an edition of Beauchamp's Histoire de la guerre en Vendée (1809) *Geschichte Hofers (1817, 2nd ed., 2 vols. 1845) and other pamphlets *Archiv für Gesch., Stat., Lit. und Kunst (20 vols., 1809–1828) *Allgemeine Geschichte der neuesten Zeit vom Tod Friedrichs des Grossen bis zum zweiten Pariser Frieden (3 vols., Vienna, 1814–1819, 2nd ed., 1891) *Wien, seine Gesch. und Denkwürdigkeiten (5 vols., Vienna, 1823–1824) *Fragmente über Deutschland, in Sondertheil Bayerns Welthandel, Lebensbilder aus dem Befreiungskriege (3 vols., Jena, 1841–1844, 2nd ed., 1845) *Die goldene Chronik von Hohenschwangau (Munich, 1842) *Anemonen aus dem Tagebuch eines alten Pilgersmanns (4 vols., Jena 1845–1847) Together with Mednyanski (1784–1844) he founded the Taschenbuch für die vaterländ.

The Lambda point is the temperature at which normal fluid helium (helium I) makes the transition to superfluid helium II (approximately 2.17 K at 1 atmosphere). The lowest pressure at which He-I and He-II can coexist is the vapor−He-I−He-II triple point at and , which is the \\"saturated vapor pressure\\" at that temperature (pure helium gas in thermal equilibrium over the liquid surface, in a hermetic container). The highest pressure at which He-I and He-II can coexist is the bcc−He-I−He-II triple point with a helium solid at , . The point's name derives from the graph (pictured) that results from plotting the specific heat capacity as a function of temperature (for a given pressure in the above range, in the example shown, at 1 atmosphere), which resembles the Greek letter lambda. The specific heat capacity has a sharp peak as the temperature approaches the lambda point. The tip of the peak is so sharp that a critical exponent characterizing the divergence of the heat capacity can be measured precisely only in zero gravity, to provide a uniform density over a substantial volume of fluid. Hence the heat capacity was measured within 2 nK below the transition in an experiment included in a Space Shuttle payload in 1992. Although the heat capacity has a peak, it does not tend towards infinity (contrary to what the graph may suggest), but has finite limiting values when approaching the transition from above and below. The behavior of the heat capacity near the peak is described by the formula C\\\\approx A_\\\\pm t^{-\\\\alpha}+B_\\\\pm where t=1-T/T_c is the reduced temperature, T_c is the Lambda point temperature, A_\\\\pm,B_\\\\pm are constants (different above and below the transition temperature), and is the critical exponent: \\\\alpha=-0.0127(3).

Although the Americans retreated, they were able to do so in good order having inflicted significant casualties on the British, killing one of the commanders of the invading force, significantly demoralizing the troops under his command and leaving some of his units lost among woods and swampy creeks, with others in confusion. This combination prompted British colonel Arthur Brooke to delay his advance against Baltimore, buying valuable time to properly prepare for the defense of the city as Stricker retreated back to the main defenses to bolster the existing force. The engagement was a part of the larger Battle of Baltimore, an American victory in the War of 1812. Background=British movements Major General Robert Ross had been dispatched to Chesapeake Bay with a brigade of veterans from the Duke of Wellington's army early in 1814, reinforced with a battalion of Royal Marines. He had defeated a hastily assembled force of Maryland and District of Columbia militia at the Battle of Bladensburg on August 24, 1814, and burned Washington. Having disrupted the American government, he withdrew to the waiting ships of the Royal Navy at the mouth of the Patuxent River before heading further up the Chesapeake Bay to the strategically more important port city of Baltimore, although the Americans managed to defeat a British landing at Caulk's Field before doing so. Ross's army of 3,700 troops and 1,000 marinesCrawford (2002) pg 273 refers to the number of Marines from each specific ship detachment landed at North Point at the end of the peninsula between the Patapsco River and the Back River on the morning of September 12, 1814, and began moving toward the city of Baltimore.Brooks and Hohwald, p. 199 American defenses Major General Samuel Smith of the Maryland militia anticipated the British move, and dispatched Brigadier General John Stricker's column to meet them. Stricker's force consisted of five regiments of Maryland militia, a small militia cavalry regiment from Maryland, a battalion of three volunteer rifle companies and a battery of six 4-pounder field guns.Elting, p. 230 Stricker deployed his brigade half way between Hampstead Hill, just outside Baltimore, where there were earthworks and artillery emplacements, and North Point. At that point, several tidal creeks narrowed the peninsula to only a mile wide, and it was considered an ideal spot for opposing the British before they reached the main American defensive positions. Stricker received intelligence that the British were camped at a farm just from his headquarters. He deployed his men between Bear Creek and Bread and Cheese Creek, which offered cover from nearby woods, and had a long wooden fence near the main road. Stricker placed the 5th Maryland Regiment and the 27th Maryland Regiment and his six guns in the front defensive line, with two regiments (the 51st and 39th) in support, and one more (the 6th) in reserve. He placed his men in mutually supporting positions, relying on numerous swamps and the two streams to stop a British flank attack, all of which he hoped would help avoid another disaster such as Bladensburg.Brooks and Hohwald, p. 200 The riflemen initially occupied a position some miles ahead of Stricker's main position, to delay the British advance. However, their commander, Captain William Dyer, hastily withdrew on hearing a rumour that British troops were landing from the Back River behind him, threatening to cut off his retreat. Stricker posted them instead on his right flank.Elting, p. 232 Battle A figure of British Major General Robert Ross as he appeared in the Baltimore campaign, in the Maryland Museum of Military History in Baltimore Opening skirmish At about midday on the 12th, Stricker heard the British had halted while the soldiers had a meal, and some sailors attached to Ross's force plundered nearby farms. He decided it would be better to provoke a fight rather than wait for a possible British night attack. At 1:00 pm, he sent Major Richard Heath with 250 men and one cannon to draw the British to Stricker's main force. Heath advanced down the road and soon began to engage the British pickets. When Ross heard the fighting, he quickly left his meal and ran to the scene. His men attempted to drive out the concealed American riflemen. Rear Admiral George Cockburn, second in command of the Royal Navy' American Station who usually accompanied Ross, was cautious about advancing without more support and Ross agreed that he would leave and bring back the main army. However, Ross never got the chance, as an American rifleman shot him in the chest. Mortally wounded, Ross turned command over to Colonel Arthur Brooke and died soon after. Main battle Brooke reorganized the British troops and prepared to assault the American positions at 3:00 pm. He decided to use his three cannon to cover an attempt by his 4th Regiment to get around the American flank, while two more regiments and the naval brigade would assault the American center. The British frontal assault took heavy casualties as the American riflemen fired into the British ranks, and lacking canister the Americans loaded their cannon with broken locks, nails and horseshoes, firing scrap metal at the British advance. Nevertheless, the British 4th Regiment managed to outflank the American positions and sent many of the American regiments fleeing. Stricker was able to conduct an organized retreat, with his men firing volleys as they continued to fall back. This proved effective, killing one of the British commanders and leaving some units lost among woods and swampy creeks, with others in confusion. Not all the militia regiments performed with equal distinction. The 51st Regiment and some men of the 39th broke and ran under fire. However, the 5th and 27th held their ground and retreated in good order, having inflicted significant casualties on the enemy.George, p.143 Only one American gun was lost. Corporal John McHenry of the 5th Regiment wrote of the battle: > Our Regiment, the 5th, carried off the praise from the other regiments > engaged, so did the company to which I have the honor to belong cover itself > with glory. When compared to the [other] Regiments we were the last that > left the ground... had our Regiment not retreated at the time it did we > should have been cut off in two minutes. Brooke did not follow the retreating Americans. He had advanced to within a mile of the main American position, but he had suffered heavier casualties than the Americans. As it was getting dark, he chose to wait until Fort McHenry was expected to be neutralized,Brooks, Hohwald p. 201 while Stricker withdrew to Baltimore's main defences. Casualties The official British Army casualty report, signed by Major Henry Debbeig, gives 39 killed and 251 wounded. Of these, 28 killed and 217 wounded belonged to the British Army; 6 killed and 20 wounded belonged to the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Royal Marines; 4 killed and 11 wounded belonged to the contingents of Royal Marines detached from Cockburn's fleet; and 1 killed (Elias Taylor) and 3 wounded belonged to the Royal Marine Artillery. As was normal, the Royal Navy submitted a separate casualty return for the engagement, signed by Rear- Admiral Cockburn, which gives 4 sailors killed and 28 wounded but contradicts the British Army casualty report by giving 3 killed (1 and 2 from HMS Madagascar and HMS Ramillies respectively) and 15 wounded for the Royal Marines detached from the ships of the Naval fleet.James, p. 521, reproducing in its entirety 'a return of killed and wounded belonging to the navy, disembarked with the army under Major General Ross, Sept. 12, 1814, Public Record Office, ADM 1/507' A subsequent casualty return from Cochrane to the Admiralty, dated 22 September 1814, gives 6 sailors killed, 1 missing and 32 wounded, with Royal Marines casualties of 1 killed and 16 wounded. The total British losses, as officially reported, were 43 killed and 279 wounded, 42 killed and 283 wounded or 44 killed, 287 wounded and 1 missing: depending upon which of the versions of the casualty returns was accurate. Historian Franklin R. Mullaly gives still another version of the British casualties, 46 killed and 295 wounded, despite using these same sources.Mullaly's sources are: '1. Return of the killed and wounded, in action with the enemy, near Baltimore, on the 12th of Sept., 1814, Public Record Office, WO 1; also, 2. a return of killed and wounded belonging to the navy, disembarked with the army under Major General Ross, Sept. 12, 1814, Public Record Office, ADM 1/507'The Pbenyon website quotes from James publication of 1827 'the total loss of the British on shore amount to 46 killed, and 300 wounded' which appears to be the totals from Debbeig and Cochrane's casualty returns, thereby double-counting the Royal Marine casualties. The American loss was 24 killed, 139 wounded and 50 taken prisoner. Aftermath William Charles, praising the stiff resistance in Baltimore, and satirizing the British retreat The battle had been costly for the British. Apart from the other casualties, losing General Ross was a critical blow to the British. He was a respected leader of British forces in the Peninsular War and the War of 1812. Ross's death proved a blow to British morale as well. The combined effect of the blow suffered at North Point and the failure of the Royal Navy to capture or get past Fort McHenry at the entrance to Baltimore harbor, despite a 25-hour bombardment, proved to be the turning point of the Battle of Baltimore. During the bombardment on Fort McHenry, Francis Scott Key was detained on a British ship at the entrance to Baltimore and penned the words to \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". The day after the battle, Brooke advanced cautiously towards Baltimore. There was no more opposition from Stricker, but when the British came into view of the main defenses of Baltimore, Brooke estimated them to be manned by up to 22,000 militia, with 100 cannon. He prepared to make a night assault against the defenses at Loudenslager Hill, but asked Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane to send boats and bomb ketches to silence an American battery, \\"Roger's Bastion\\", on the flank of his proposed attack. Despite a stiff fight between the boats, commanded by Captain Charles John Napier and the American batteries, the Bastion was unharmed and Brooke called off the attack and withdrew before dawn.Elting, pp. 238–242 The British re-embarked at North Point. Legacy The battle is commemorated through the Maryland state holiday of Defenders Day, as well as on the patch of the Baltimore County Sheriff's Office. The lineage of the 5th Maryland is perpetuated by the 175th Infantry Regiment (MD ARNG), one of nineteen Army National Guard units with campaign credit for the War of 1812. The Maryland Museum of Military History, housed in the Fifth Regiment Armory in Baltimore, Maryland, features an exhibit on the Battle of Baltimore which was installed to mark the 200th anniversary of the battle.

The company was founded in 1946 as Chemie Grünenthal and has been continuously family-owned. The company was the first to introduce penicillin into the German market in the postwar period, after the Allied Control Council lifted its ban. Grünenthal became infamous in the 1950s and 1960s for the development and sale of the teratogenic drug thalidomide, marketed as the sleeping pill Contergan and promoted as a morning sickness preventative. Thalidomide caused severe birth defects, miscarriages, and other severe health problems. Though these side effects were proven conclusively in 1959, and 1962, Grünenthal continued marketing the drug well into the 1970s and 1980s. The company generates more than 50 percent of its income with pain medications such as the drug Tramadol. The company has two offices in Germany as well as subsidiaries in Europe, Latin America, the US, and China. In November 2016, the company acquired Thar Pharmaceuticals and in 2018 Averitas Pharma.  History  former headquarters in Stolberg Chemie Grünenthal was founded 1946 by Hermann Wirtz, Sr. as Chemie Grünenthal GmbH in Stolberg (Rhineland). Later, it was renamed in Grünenthal GmbH, and its headquarters were moved to Aachen. The Allied Control Council had prohibited the research and manufacture of penicillin by German companies. When the ban was lifted, Grünenthal was the first company to introduce penicillin in the postwar period into the German market. This investment achieved a big financial boost for the company.  Thalidomide (Contergan)  Under Head of Research and former Nazi scientist Heinrich Mückter, Grünenthal synthesised thalidomide in 1954 and acquired a 20-year patent. Soon after obtaining its patent in April 1954, the company started clinical trials, and from November 1956, marketed the drug for the treatment of respiratory infections under the trade name Grippex, a combination drug that contained thalidomide, quinine, vitamin C, phenacetin, and acetylsalicylic acid. Researchers at Chemie Grünenthal also found that the drug was particularly effective for pregnant women suffering from morning sickness, although no trials were run with pregnant women. In 1957, the company began marketing thalidomide as Contergan. In 1958, an unusual number of deformities in newborns were reported in Germany. However, scientists first assumed nuclear tests to be the reason for that. Only in late 1961, researchers found out that Contergan must be the cause. In November 1961, thalidomide was thus taken off the market. Thalidomide caused severe deformities in the children of women who took the drug during pregnancy. Experts estimate that the drug thalidomide led to the death of about 2,000 children and serious birth defects in more than 10,000 children, about 5,000 of them in West Germany. East German regulatory authorities did not approve thalidomide, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also declined to approve the drug. One reason for the initially unobserved side effects of the drug and the subsequent approval in Germany was that at that time drugs did not have to be tested for teratogenic effects. Thalidomide had only been tested on rodents, as was usual practice at the time. In the UK, the British pharmaceutical company The Distillers Company (Biochemicals) Ltd, a subsidiary of Distillers Co. Ltd. (which became part of Diageo plc in 1997) marketed thalidomide under the brand name Distaval as a remedy for morning sickness throughout the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Their advertisement claimed, \\"Distaval can be given with complete safety to pregnant women and nursing mothers without adverse effect on mother or child...Outstandingly safe Distaval has been prescribed for nearly three years in this country.\\" Around the world, more and more pharmaceutical companies started to produce and market the drug under license from Chemie Grünenthal. By the mid 1950s, 14 pharmaceutical companies were marketing thalidomide in 46 countries under 37 (some reports suggest 51) different trade names. In the US, representatives from Chemie Grünenthal initially approached Smith-Kline and French with a request to market and distribute the drug in North America. A newly discovered memorandum, found hidden in 2010 the archives of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration shows that, as part of their in-licensing approach, Smith-Kline and French conducted animal tests and ran a clinical trial of the drug in the U.S. involving 875 people, including pregnant women, in 1956–57. In 1956, researchers at SKF involved in clinical trials, noted that even when used in very high doses, thalidomide could not induce sleep in mice. When administered at doses 50 to 650 times larger than that claimed by Chemie Grunenthal to be \\"sleep inducing\\", the researchers still could not achieve the hypnotic effect in animals that it had on man. After completion of the trial, and based on reasons kept hidden for decades, SKF declined to commercialize the drug. Later, Chemie Grünenthal, in 1958, reached an agreement with William S Merrell Company of Clarinbridge, Galway, to market and distribute thalidomide throughout the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration refused to approve thalidomide for marketing and distribution. However, the drug was distributed in large quantities for testing purposes after the American distributor and manufacturer Richardson-Merrell had applied for its approval in September, 1960. The official in charge of the FDA, Frances Oldham Kelsey, did not rely on information from the company which did not include any test results. Richardson-Merrell was called on to perform tests and report the results. The company requested approval six times and was refused each time. Nevertheless, a total of 17 children with thalidomide-induced malformations were born. A Long Island, New York family sued the drug maker after their twins were born with deformities in May 1961. Their son was born without arms, with hands growing from his shoulders, and their daughter suffered from a number of internal deformities. The mother was a German woman who had met her husband in 1959 while studying at the University of Florence. She came to the United States with Contergan tablets she had brought from Germany and a prescription from her physician. The lawsuit alleged that Chemie Grünenthal was negligent in the testing of thalidomide and that they failed to warn of its effects on unborn children. By 1968, the company stated that thalidomide was not recommended for use \\"during pregnancy as such\\". The qualifying term obstetrics was employed. It was used in hindsight to strengthen the argument that doctors would interpret the word to mean that thalidomide was safe during the final stage of pregnancy only. This is a fallacious form of reasoning according to the German Medical Association, which defines obstetrics as starting with conception. As a result of the thalidomide scandal, the Health Law in West Germany was strengthened and new requirements for pharmaceutical testing were created; the Federal Ministry of Health was established in 1962. = Criminal trial = In 1968, Grünenthal executives were tried for involuntary manslaughter. In 1970, the indictment was closed due to the minor guilt of the defendants and insufficient public interest in further proceedings. = Reparations = In 1970, Grünenthal paid DM 100 million to the , and the German government paid reparations of DM 320 million. Between 1997 and 2008, Grünenthal declined further payments to thalidomide victims. At the end of 2007, the British entrepreneur Nicholas Dobrik organised a group of victims and began an international campaign for further reparations. On 8 May 2008, Grünenthal announced it would voluntarily pay further €50 million to the Thalidomide Foundation to help to improve the lives of thalidomide victims. = Apology = In August 2012, the company issued its first apology in a half-century, saying it regretted the consequences of the drug. Harald Stock, Grunenthal's chief executive, said the company had failed to reach out \\"from person to person\\" to the victims and their mothers over the past 50 years. The company has refused to compensate the Spanish victims of the drug who have sued the company. = Leprosy treatment = In 1964, Israeli physician Jacob Sheskin discovered the positive effect of thalidomide in the treatment of leprosy. Since the 1970s, Grünenthal has delivered thalidomide tablets to leprosy clinics to assist the fight against leprosy. The delivery takes place under strict conditions and by virtue of an agreement with the World Health Organization. Grünenthal provided thalidomide to more than 1,000 patients with leprosy in the United States until a few months before July, 1986. The drug is especially helpful to patients with leprosy in treating an extremely painful allergic reaction of the skin. The company discontinued exporting thalidomide because of liability fears. A lack of insurance coverage for those requiring the drug was also a problem.  Versatis and Tapentadol cases  In July 2010, the British Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA) received complainants about a poster used by field-based teams at Grünenthal. It promoted the off-label use of Versatis, while the cost comparison analysis was flawed and misleading. The company stated that it had paid for the printing but no editorial control. Nevertheless, the Code of Practice was breached, and an undertaking was received. In November 2010, the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) received an allegation that Grünenthal promoted its unlicensed product, Tapentadol, to health professionals. Grünenthal conducted an investigation and concluded that the allegation was unsubstantiated. To date, the PMCPA website lists 16 completed cases involving Grünenthal.  Further drug development  The company has focused on the treatment of pain and is doing its own research and development in this field. Grünenthal developed the drug Tramadol, which is marketed under the brand name Tramal, one of the best-selling opioid painkillers. Other business units are gynecology, dermatology, and anti- infectives. Current products include the birth control pill Belara and the matrix pain patch Transtec. Unlike Tramadol, which is a Schedule IV(C-IV) medication, the drug Tapentadol HCl, as licensed by Grünenthal, is Schedule II(C-II) in the U.S. (meaning it is a potent agonist, therefore subject to abuse similar to other C-II opioids, such as oxycodone and morphine). In 2018, Grünenthal acquired the pain-related brands Nexium and Vimovo and the US- rights for Qutenza (capsaicin). The company began building a US structure to commercialise the latter asset through Averitas Pharma. Later in 2018, Grünenthal obtained global rights for Qutenza.  Social commitment In 1998, the company launched the Grünenthal Foundation for Palliative Medicine. With its help, the first academic chair and clinic for palliative care was founded at the RWTH Aachen University in 2010. Since 2004, Grünenthal supports young scientists by realizing innovative research projects regarding pain treatment. The EFIC-Grünenthal-Grant is with €200,000 the world's largest prize in its field. Bursaries of up to €30,000 are awarded per project. Since 2009, the company has been member of the social initiative . Also, it is founding member of the organization .

The concept of consideration has been adopted by other common law jurisdictions, including the US. Consideration can be anything of value (such as any goods, money, services, or promises of any of these), which each party gives as a quid pro quo to support their side of the bargain. Mutual promises constitute consideration for each other.e.g. I promise you that I will do X, in consideration for which you promise me that you will do Y\\". If only one party offers consideration, the agreement is a \\"bare promise\\" and is unenforceable. Value According to Currie v Misa,Currie v Misa (1875) LR 10 Ex 893 consideration for a particular promise exists where some right, interest, profit or benefit accrues (or will accrue) to the promisor as a direct result of some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility that has been given, suffered or undertaken by the promisee. Forbearance to act amounts to consideration only if one is thereby surrendering a legal right.Wade v Simeon (1846) 2 CB 548White v Bluett (1853) 2 WR 75Bronaugh R. (1976). Agreement, Mistake, and Objectivity in the Bargain Theory of Conflict. William & Mary Law Review. \\"Past consideration is no consideration\\": consideration must be \\"executory\\" or \\"executed\\", but not \\"past\\"; that is, consideration must be supplied in the present or in the future, but things done beforehand cannot be good consideration. Roscorla v Thomas *ex nudo pacto actio non oritur *Dyer's case (1414) 2 Hen. 5, 5 Pl. 26 *Lucy v Walwyn was an early case on the doctrine of consideration, concerning an executory contract where the plaintiff recovered damages for the loss of a bargain.Lucy v Walwyn (1561) KB 27/1026, m. 76; 94 Seldon Soc. 268. *Thomas v Thomas.Thomas v Thomas [1842] EngR 260; (1842) 2 QB 851. was a case where £1 was seen to be good consideration for a widow to continue to live in her house after her husband's death. *White v Bluett: Bluett, when sued by his father’s executors for an outstanding debt to his father, claimed that his father had promised to discharge him from it in return for him stopping complaining about property distribution. The Court held that the cessation of complaints was of no economic value; thus, Bluett’s father had received no real consideration for the promise, and the debt was enforceable at law.White v Bluett (1853) 23 LJ Ex 36. *Currie v Misa Lush J. referred to consideration as consisting of a detriment to the promisee or a benefit to the promisor: \\"... some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other.\\"Currie v Misa (1875) LR 10 Ex 153 at p. 162 ;(1875-76) LR 1 App Cas 554. *Bolton v Madden Blackburn J, \\"The general rule is that an executory agreement, by which the plaintiff agrees to do something on the terms that the defendant agrees to do something else, may be enforced if what the plaintiff has agreed to do is either for the benefit of the defendant or to the trouble or prejudice of the plaintiff.\\"Bolton v Madden (1873) LR 9 QB 55 at p. 56. *Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd: Lord Dunedin quotes the definition of Sir Frederick Pollock, \\"An act or forbearance of one party, or the promise thereof, is the price for which the promise of the other is bought and the promise thus given for value is enforceable.\\".Pollock on Contracts, 8th ed., p. 175 Adequacy For consideration to be good consideration, it must be of some value, even if it is minimal value. There is no requirement that the consideration be commensurate in economic terms to the original promise. Nominal consideration will suffice as good consideration for a contract, Courts will not measure the adequacy of the consideration as it is up to the parties to decide the subjective worth of each promise. In the British House of Lords case Chappell & Co Ltd v Nestle Co Ltd (1959), Lord Somervell said: \\"A contracting party can stipulate for what consideration he chooses. A peppercorn does not cease to be good consideration if it is established that the promisor does not like pepper and will throw away the corn.\\". Past conduct A promise cannot be based upon consideration that was said, given or done before the promise was performed. Something said afterwards, will not count as consideration. For example, if X promises to reward Y for an act that Y had already performed then while the performance of that act is good consideration, for the promise to be rewarded for it is past consideration and therefore not good consideration. In Eastwood v Kenyon the guardian of a young girl raised a loan to educate the girl and to improve her marriage prospects. After her marriage, her husband promised to pay off the loan. It was held that the guardian could not enforce the promise as taking out the loan to raise and educate the girl was past consideration, because it was completed before the husband promised to repay it.Eastwood v Kenyon [1840] EngR 90, [1840] 11 Ad & E 438, 113 Eng Rep 482. Furthermore, where a contract exists between two parties and one party, subsequent to formation, promises to confer an additional benefit on the other party to the contract, that promise is not binding because the promisee's consideration, which is his entry into the original contract, had already been completed (or \\"used\\") at the time the next promise is made. In Roscorla v Thomas, Roscorla had contracted to buy a horse from Thomas for £30. After the sale, Thomas promised Roscorla that the horse was sound; the horse turned out to be vicious. It was held that Roscorla could not enforce the promise, as the consideration given for entering into the contract to buy the horse had been completed by the time the promise was made; in a sense, the consideration was \\"used up\\".. The rule that past consideration is not good consideration is subject to the exception discussed by the Privy Council in Pao On v Lau Yiu Long.. In that case, their Lordships held that past consideration can be good consideration where: # The promisee performed the original act at the request of the promisor; # It was clearly understood or implied between the parties that the promisee would be rewarded for the performance of the act; # The actual promise made, if made before the promisee provided the consideration, must be capable of being enforced, in other words giving rise to a legally binding contract. Illusory consideration There must be some kind of connection between a promise and the consideration offered to support the promise. It is no consideration to \\"refrain from a course of conduct which it was never intended to pursue\\".Arrale v Costain Civil Engineering Ltd [1976] 1 Lloyd's Rep 98. The consideration must have been at least an inducement to enter into the promise. Forbearing to sue *Callisher v Bischoffsheim, forbearance to sue in a groundless action still good consideration; honest mistake.Callisher v Bischoffsheim (1870) LR 5 QB 449. Privity A promise is enforceable if it is supported by consideration, that is, where consideration has moved from the promisee. For example, in the case of Tweddle v Atkinson,. John Tweddle promised William Guy that he would pay a sum of money to the child of William Guy, and likewise William Guy promised John Tweddle that he would pay a sum of money to the child of John Tweddle, upon the marriage of the two children to each other. However, William Guy failed to pay the son of John Tweddle, who then sued his executors for the amount promised. It was held that the son could not enforce the promise made to his father, as he himself had not actually given consideration for it - it was his father who had done so instead. The son didn't receive any consideration, so he cannot enforce the promise. This particular rule of consideration forms the basis of the doctrine of privity of a contract, that is, only a party to a contract is permitted to sue upon that contract's terms. (Note that the doctrine of privity has been somewhat altered by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.) Therefore, consideration from the promisee was indulgent of the claim. Although consideration must move from the promisee, it does not necessarily have to move to the promisor. The promisee may provide consideration to a third party, if this is agreed at the time the parties contracted. The offeree must provide consideration, although the consideration does not have to flow to the offeror. For example, it is good consideration for person A to pay person C in return for services rendered by person B. If there are joint promisees, then consideration need only to move from one of the promisees. Pre-existing duties If the promisee provides what he was required by public law to do in any event in return for a promise, promised performance of existing duty is not good consideration. In Collins v Godefrey Godefrey promised to pay Collins for his giving of evidence. It was held that Collins could not enforce the promise as he was under a statutory duty to give evidence in any event.. However, if the promisee provides more than what public duty imposes on him, then this is good consideration. In Ward v Byham a mother was under a statutory duty to look after her child. The ex-husband promised to pay her £1 a week if she ensured that the child was well looked after and happy. It was held that notwithstanding the statutory duty imposed on the mother, she could enforce the promise since the act of keeping the baby 'happy' provided additional consideration.. Promising to perform a pre- existing duty owed to one's contracting party also fails to make good consideration.. However this rule has been considerably narrowed by recent case law. The general rule is that if a creditor promises to discharge a debt in return for a fraction of payment, in paying the agreed fraction, the promisee is not providing consideration for the promise, as this is merely part performance of a contractual duty already owed.Pinnel's Case (1602) 77 ER 237; [1602] 5 Co. Rep. 117a.Pinnel's Case was confirmed by . Consequently, the debtor is still liable for the whole amount, as he cannot force the promisor to accept less. A leading example is in Stilk v Myrick where Stilk, a seaman, agreed with Myrick to sail his boat to the Baltic Sea and back for £5 per month. During the voyage, two men deserted. Myrick promised he would increase Stilk's wages if Stilk agreed to honour his contract in light of the desertions. Stilk agreed and on return to port, Myrick refused to pay him the extra wages. It was held that Myrick's fresh promise was not enforceable as the consideration Stilk had provided for it, the performance of a duty he already owed to Myrick under contract, was not good consideration for Myrick's promise to increase his wages.. Initially, there were only two exceptions to this rule: *Hanson v Royden, the promisee has done, or has promised to do, more than he was obliged to do under his contract.Hanson v Royden (1867) LR 3 CP 47. *Hartley v Ponsonby before the fresh promise was made, circumstances had arisen which would have entitled the promisee to refuse to carry out his obligations under his contract.Hartley v Ponsonby [1857] EngR 605; 119 ER 1471; (1857) 7 E & B 872. Factual benefits However, the strictness of this rule was severely limited in Williams v Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd.. The Roffey Brothers entered into a contract to refurbish a block of flats for a fixed price of £20,000. They sub-contracted carpentry work to Williams. It became apparent that Williams was threatened by financial difficulties and would not be able to complete his work on time. This would have breached a term in the main contract, incurring a penalty. Roffey Brothers offered to pay Williams an additional £575 for each flat completed. Williams continued to work on this basis, but soon it became apparent that Roffey Brothers were not going to pay the additional money. He ceased work and sued Roffey Brothers for the extra money, for the eight flats he had completed after the promise of additional payment. The Court of Appeal held that Roffey Brothers must pay Williams the extra money, as they had enjoyed practical benefits from the promise they had made to Williams. The benefits they received from it include: Having the work completed on time, not having to spend money and time seeking another carpenter and not having to pay the penalty. In the circumstances, these benefits were sufficient to provide consideration for the promise made to Williams of additional payment. It now seems that the performance of an existing duty may constitute consideration for a new promise, in the circumstances where no duress or fraud are found and where the practical benefits are to the promisor. The performance of an existing contractual duty owed to the promisor is not good consideration for a fresh promise given by the promisor. However, performance of an existing contractual duty owed to a third party can be good consideration, see further below. According to the Court of Appeal, it is unlikely that either avoiding a breach of contract with a third party, avoiding the trouble and expense of engaging a third party to carry out work or avoiding a penalty clause in a third party contract will be a \\"practical benefit\\". In Simon Container Machinery Ltd v Emba Machinery AB, the practical benefit was held to be the avoiding of a breach of contract, which was clearly not an extension of the principle.Simon Container Machinery Ltd v Emba Machinery Ltd [1998] 2 Lloyds Rep 428. This is true unless the debtor provided fresh consideration for the promise. The following, mentioned in Pinnel's Case, and confirmed by Sibree v. Tripp,Sibree v Tripp [1846] EngR 269; 153 ER 745; (1846) 15 M & W 23; 15 LJEx 318 may amount to fresh consideration: # If the promisee offers part payment earlier than full payment was due, and this is of benefit to the creditor; # If the promisee offers part payment at a different place than where full payment was due, and this is of benefit to the creditor; or, # If the promisee pays the debt in part by another chattel (note, however, that part payment by cheque, where full payment was due by another means, is not consideration..) Another exception is that part payment of the debt by a third party as consideration for a promise to discharge the creditor from the full sum, prevents the creditor then suing the debtor for full payment (see Welby v Drake). The Court of Appeal, in Re Selectmove Ltd,. stated that the practical benefit doctrine, arising from Williams v Roffey, cannot be used as an additional exception to the rule. In that case, it was held that the doctrine only applies where the original promise was a promise to pay extra and not to pay less. The Court of Appeal in Re Selectmove were unable to distinguish Foakes v Beer (a House of Lords decision), in order to apply Williams v Roffey (a Court of Appeal decision). It therefore remains to be seen whether the House of Lords would decide this point differently. In any event, the equitable principle of promissory estoppel may provide the debtor with relief.Atlas Express Ltd v Kafco (Importers & Distributors) Ltd [1989] QB 833. The Court of Appeal in June 2016 in MWB v Rock Advertising revisited the issue of whether the practical benefit doctrine could be applied to decreasing pacts or agreements to accept less. Arden LJ and Kitchin LJ both endorsed this approach indicating that part payment along with practical benefit could be enough to support a promise to accept less. The decision has been criticised as extending the practical benefit test beyond its limits. Existing duties to third parties Consideration for a promise can be the performance of a contractual duty owed to someone other than the promisor. In Shadwell v Shadwell, Cayley Shadwell was under a contractual duty with a third party to marry. His uncle, Charles Shadwell promised to pay him £150 per year after he was married. It was held that Cayley Shadwell marrying was good consideration, notwithstanding that he was obliged by a contract with a third party to marry in any event.; confirmed by The Eurymedon [1938] 1 All ER 122;(1935-1938) 1 Res Judicatae 339. A promise to perform a pre-existing contractual duty owed to a third party (as opposed to the performance of that duty) may also amount to consideration. *NZ Shipping Co Ltd v A M Satterthwaite & Co Ltd..

He is best known as the former co-anchor of Dateline NBC, a news magazine TV series. He also has worked as a substitute anchor for NBC Nightly News and Today and as a substitute moderator on Meet the Press. Prior to his tenure at NBC, he was an ABC News correspondent for 20/20 and World News Tonight. Early life Stone Phillips was born in Texas City, Texas, to parents Victor and Grace Phillips, a Monsanto chemical engineer and school teacher, respectively. Victor Phillips is a veteran of World War II. Phillips and his siblings—brother Victor III and sister Minta—were raised in the Claymont section of Ballwin, Missouri, in the Greater St. Louis area. As a boy Phillips was an acolyte at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Ellisville, Missouri, where his parents were founding members of the congregation. Phillips attended Parkway West High School in Ballwin, Missouri, where he was an honor student and starting quarterback on the football team. Phillips is of Scottish ancestry. Phillips matriculated at Yale University where he continued to excel in academics and in athletics. In 1976, he was starting quarterback for the Yale Bulldogs squad that won the Ivy League football championship. Phillips was a member of Yale's Scroll and Key secret society and earned the university's prestigious F. Gordon Brown Award for outstanding academic and athletic leadership. Phillips graduated with honors from Yale in 1977, earning a Bachelor of Philosophy. Career After graduating from Yale, Phillips moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he worked as a remedial reading and math teacher at the Fulton County Juvenile Detention Center. He was supplementing his pay by moonlighting as a waiter when he landed an entry-level news position at WXIA-TV, the local NBC affiliate. In 1980, after less than two years as a reporter, writer, and broadcast producer in Atlanta, Phillips was hired by ABC News as an assignment editor for its Washington, D.C., news bureau. In 1982, he began filing stories as an on-air correspondent for ABC, covering such major events as the war in Lebanon, the exodus of Vietnamese boat people in the mid-1980s, and Rajiv Gandhi's election campaign following the assassination of his mother, Indira Gandhi. In 1986, Phillips was promoted to a regular role on the ABC news magazine 20/20. Beginning that year, he also served as a substitute host on Good Morning America and a sports anchor for ABC’s World News Sunday. Phillips ended his twelve-year relationship with ABC in 1992, joining NBC News to serve as co- anchor with Jane Pauley on Dateline NBC. While at NBC News, Phillips also hosted Weekend Magazine with Stone Phillips. He conducted a long list of notable interviews during his time with NBC. Among them was the first network interview with Lynndie England, the U.S. Army soldier, about her role in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. Others included notorious serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and Bernhard Goetz (a man who shot four black teenagers in the New York City Subway). The latter earned Phillips an Emmy Award for Outstanding Interview. Phillips co-anchored Dateline NBC from its inception until July 2, 2007, when NBC did not renew his $7 million contract. On October 17, 2005, Phillips was the guest on the premiere episode of The Colbert Report. Phillips' delivery was part of the inspiration for comedian Stephen Colbert's persona on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. (46 mins 45 seconds into The Paul Mercurio Show audio file at the bottom of this Hollywood Reporter web page) On December 18, 2014, Phillips would again appear on the final episode of The Colbert Report. As of 2012, Phillips was contributing reports to the PBS NewsHour. In 2013, he reported on golf course water usage for The Golf Channel. In May 2013, Phillips produced and hosted Moving with Grace, a documentary airing on PBS stations that chronicled his efforts and those of his siblings to provide care for their aging parents. It also explored various issues faced by other baby boomers in similar circumstance. Family Phillips lives in New York with his wife Debra. Debra Del Toro-Phillips is Puerto Rican by birth but moved to New York City as a child. After a successful career in the fashion industry she returned to college and earned a master's degree in social work. The couple has one child, son Streeter Phillips, born in 1988. A daughter was born in August 1995 but died that same day. His brother Victor is a biologist, and sister Minta is a retired radiologist residing in North Carolina.

When Charlemagne divided his empire among his sons, his son Charles was designated King of the Franks.  Life  His eldest half-brother, Pippin the Hunchback, had been sent to the monastery of Prüm in 792 after having been involved in a rebellion against their father, Charlemagne. Of his younger brothers, Carloman (renamed Pippin) and Louis the Pious, were appointed sub- kings of Italy and Aquitaine. Charles was mostly preoccupied with the Bretons, whose border he shared and who rebelled on at least two occasions and were easily put down, but he was also sent against the Saxons on multiple occasions. Charles' father outlived him, however, and the entire kingdom thus went to his younger brother Louis the Pious, Pippin also having died. Around 789, it was suggested by Charlemagne that Charles the Younger should be married to Offa's daughter Ælfflæd. Offa insisted that the marriage could only go ahead if Charlemagne's daughter Bertha was married to Offa's son Ecgfrith. Charlemagne took offence, broke off contact, and closed his ports to English traders. Eventually, normal relations were reestablished and the ports were reopened. Just a few years later, in 796, Charlemagne and Offa concluded the first commercial treaty known in English history. His father associated Charles in the government of Francia and Saxony in 790, and installed him as ruler of the ducatus Cenomannicus (corresponding to the later Duchy of Maine) with the title of king. Charles was crowned King of the Franks at Rome 25 December, 800, the same day his father was crowned Emperor. He killed Sorbian duke Miliduch and Slavic Knez, Nussito (Nessyta) near modern-day Weißenfels in a Frankish campaign in 806. On 4 December 811, in Bavaria, Charles had a stroke and died. He left no children. In the Matter of France, Charles is fictionalized as Charlot.

A frog war occurs when one private railroad company attempts to cross the tracks of another, and this results in hostilities between the two railroads. It is named after the frog, the piece of track that allows the two tracks to join or cross and is usually part of a level junction or railroad switch. A frog war usually begins with legal actions, such as filing lawsuits and appealing to civic transportation authorities. But often the situation escalates into physical actions, with companies pitting their workers against one another with construction projects and train movements intended to frustrate or challenge the opposing railroad. Division of costs It is generally the case that the second railway to arrive at an intended crossing has to bear the cost of the special trackwork needed to cross the first. This includes the cost of any interlocking tower or signal box. The latter is not necessarily to the disadvantage of the second railway, since it can signal its trains through the junction ahead of those belonging to the first railway, depending on who employs the signalman. \\"Frog Wars\\" with oil pipelines In the early days of the oil industry, most oil traveled by rail. As oil pipelines became more common, railway companies often saw them as threats to their business and refused to grant permission for pipelines to cross their tracks. Bridges and riverboats Abraham Lincoln participated in a celebrated court case that decided that railroads had as much right to bridge rivers as the riverboat had the right to navigate those rivers. Nova Scotia's Shubenacadie Canal was rendered useless by a railway bridge built across it in 1870.

After a deal to acquire the property on the owner's own terms fell through, he vehemently refused to sell it or allow a crossing to be built, necessitating the circumvention of the property using a tight bend in the track. United States Note: The first railroad line built is the first one named. * 1853: A feud between the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway and the Illinois Central Railroad led both railroads to run through Greater Grand Crossing in Chicago as if the other railroad didn't exist, finally resulting in a crash that killed 18 people. * 1867: The South Carolina Railroad vs. the Columbia and Augusta Railroad (later the Charlotte, Columbia and Augusta Railroad).

The Carmina Ecclesiastica of Aldhelm, Bishop of Sherborne (died 709), written a generation after Centwine's reign, records that he won three great battles. In addition, it states that he was a pagan for part of his reign, adopting Christianity and becoming a patron of the church. The Chronicle's version of his ancestry makes Centwine a son of King Cynegils, and thus a brother of King Cenwalh and maybe of Cwichelm, King of the Gewisse, but Aldhelm does not record any such relationship.Kirby, p. 53.

He served from 1 July 1896 to 4 November 1901. He was also an amateur painter, photographer and antique collector. He was born in Belper, Derbyshire, the son of attorney James Oldham Swettenham, Frank Swettenham at biography.com and Charlotte Elizabeth Carr and was educated at the Dollar Academy in Scotland and St Peter's School, York. He was a descendant of Mathew Swetenham, Henry IV's bow bearer, and the younger brother of the colonial administrator Sir James Alexander Swettenham. He was one of close to forty former British Empire officials to oppose the Malayan Union. Swettenham co-authored a A Dictionary of the Malay Language with Hugh Clifford. The dictionary, which was published in stages between 1894 and 1902, was abandoned after the letter 'G' as by then it had been made redundant by the publication of R.J. Wilkinson's A Malay English Dictionary. He also published four books: Malay Sketches, Unaddressed Letters, Also & Perhaps and Arabella in Africa, the last being illustrated by the famous mural painter and illustrator, Rex Whistler. The book was Whistler's first official commission. Career between 1871 and 1901 Sir Frank Swettenham Swettenham was a British colonial official in British Malaya, who was famous as highly influential in shaping British policy and the structure of British administration in the Malay Peninsula. In 1871 Swettenham was first sent to Singapore as a cadet in the civil service of the Straits Settlements (Singapore, Malacca, and Penang Island). He learned the Malay language and played a major role as British- Malay intermediary in the events surrounding British intervention in the peninsular Malay states in the 1870s. He was a member of the Commission for the Pacification of Larut set up following the signing of the Pangkor Treaty of 1874 and he served alongside John Frederick Adolphus McNair, and Chinese Kapitan Chung Keng Quee and Chin Seng Yam. The Commission was successful in freeing many women taken as captives during the Larut Wars (1862–73), getting stockades dismantled and getting the tin mining business going again. More than a decade later, in 1882, he was appointed as resident (adviser) to the Malay state of Selangor. In Selangor office, the development of coffee and tobacco estates had successfully promoted by him, while in the meantime, helped boost tin earnings by constructing a railway from Kuala Lumpur (it was capital of Selangor at that time), to the port of Klang, which was later named Port Swettenham in his honour. He attended the federation, along with the title of resident-general after he secured an agreement of federation from the states of Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan, and Pahang in 1895, when he was a resident of Perak state. In 1897 he was knighted by Queen Victoria, and in October 1901, three years before his retirement, he was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Straits Settlements. Swettenham had long been critical of the influence of Siam in the northern Malay states of Kelantan and Trengganu, which had traditionally recognised the suzerainty of Siam by sending a tribute of a golden flower to the King of Siam every three years. After his appointment as Governor of the Straits Settlements, he attempted to negotiate with Siam for greater British influence over the affairs of these states. Siam reluctantly agreed to appoint British advisors, but only on the condition that they were appointed by Bangkok, not by the Foreign Office as he had hoped. However, the process had been initiated whereby these two states and eventually Kedah would eventually accept British Residents. Swettenham was disappointed in his ultimate goal of bringing the southern Thai region of Patani under British control. Personal life While on home leave in England in the summer of 1877, Swettenham met and became engaged to Constance Sydney Holmes (b. 1858), daughter of Cecil Frederick Holmes, a housemaster at Harrow School. They married in England in February 1878 and returned together to Singapore, where the nineteen-year old Sydney Swettenham attempted to come to terms with her new role as the wife of a colonial official. Their marriage, which was strained from the beginning and marked by long periods of separation, lasted until 1938, when Frank Swettenham successfully sued for divorce on the grounds of his wife's insanity. Swettenham became friends with Gertrude Bell when she visited Singapore in 1903 and maintained a correspondence with her until 1909. They are thought to have had a \\"brief but passionate affair\\"after his retirement to England. Frank Swettenham remarried at the age of 89, this time to Vera Seton Guthrie (1890–1970) on 22 June 1939, daughter of John Gordon, a successful merchant, and widow of John Neil Guthrie, who had been killed in action in France during World War I. While in India in 1883 preparing for the Colonial Exhibition in Calcutta, Swettenham met and had a child with an Anglo-Indian woman from Bangalore (known only as Miss Good). To avoid a scandal, the mother of Swettenham's son was married to an English clerk in the Perak civil service, Walter McKnight Young, and his son was raised as Walter Aynsley Young.

According to Lars Fogelin, this was \\"not a singular event, with a singular cause; it was a centuries-long process.\\" The decline of Buddhism has been attributed to various factors, especially the regionalisation of India after the end of the Gupta Empire (320–650 CE), which led to the loss of patronage and donations as Indian dynasties turned to the services of Hindu Brahmins. Another factor was invasions of north India by various groups such as Indo-Iranian Huns, White Huns, Sunni Muslim Turkic-Mongolians, Arabs and Persians and subsequent destruction of Buddhist institutions such as Nalanda and religious persecutions. Religious competition with Hinduism and later Islam were also important factors. Islamization of Bengal and demolitions of Nalanda, Vikramasila and Odantapuri by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji, a general of the Delhi Sultanate are thought to have severely weakened the practice of Buddhism in East India. The total Buddhist population in 2010 in the Indian subcontinent – excluding that of Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan – was about 10 million, of which about 7.2% lived in Bangladesh, 92.5% in India and 0.2% in Pakistan.Religion population totals in 2010 by Country Pew Research, Washington DC (2012)  Growth of Buddhism  Map of the Buddhist missions during the reign of Ashoka. Buddhism expanded in the Indian subcontinent in the centuries after the death of the Buddha, particularly after receiving the endorsement and royal support of the Maurya Empire under Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE. It spread even beyond the Indian subcontinent to Central Asia and China. The Buddha's period saw not only urbanisation, but also the beginnings of centralised states.Richard Gombrich, A Global Theory of Intellectual Change. Harvard University Press, 2000, p. 205. The successful expansion of Buddhism depended on the growing economy of the time, together with increased centralised political organisations capable of change.Richard Gombrich, A Global Theory of Intellectual Change. Harvard University Press, 2000, p. 184. Buddhism spread across ancient India and state support by various regional regimes continued through the 1st-millennium BCE. The consolidation of the monastic organisation made Buddhism the centre of religious and intellectual life in India. The succeeding Kanva Dynasty had four Buddhist Kanva Kings. Gupta Dynasty (4th-6th century)=Religious developments During the Gupta dynasty (4th to 6th century), Mahayana Buddhism turned more ritualistic, while Buddhist ideas were adopted into Hindu schools. The differences between Buddhism and Hinduism blurred, and Vaishnavism, Shaivism and other Hindu traditions became increasingly popular, while Brahmins developed a new relationship with the state. As the system grew, Buddhist monasteries gradually lost control of land revenue. In parallel, the Gupta kings built Buddhist temples such as the one at Kushinagara, and monastic universities such as those at Nalanda, as evidenced by records left by three Chinese visitors to India.  Hun Invasions (6th century)  Chinese scholars traveling through the region between the 5th and 8th centuries, such as Faxian, Xuanzang, Yijing, Hui-sheng, and Sung-Yun, began to speak of a decline of the Buddhist Sangha in the Northwestern parts of Indian subcontinent, especially in the wake of the Hun invasion from central Asia in the 6th century CE. Xuanzang wrote that numerous monasteries in north-western India had been reduced to ruins by the Huns. The Hun ruler Mihirakula, who ruled from 515 CE in north-western region (modern Afghanistan, Pakistan and north India), suppressed Buddhism as well. He did this by destroying monasteries as far away as modern-day Prayagraj. Yashodharman and Gupta Empire rulers, in and after about 532 CE, reversed Mihirakula's campaign and ended the Mihirakula era.Foreign Influence on Ancient India by Krishna Chandra Sagar p. 216 According to Peter Harvey, the religion recovered slowly from these invasions during the 7th century, with the \\"Buddhism of southern Pakistan remaining strong.\\" The reign of the Pala Dynasty (8th to 12th century) saw Buddhism in North India recover due to royal support from the Palas who supported various Buddhist centers like Nalanda. By the eleventh century, Pala rule had weakened, however.  Socio-political change and religious competition  During the period of the Tripartite Struggle (7-12th centuries), most major and minor Indian dynasties gradually shifted their support towards various forms of Hinduism or Jainism (with the exception of the Palas). The regionalisation of India after the end of the Gupta Empire (320–650 CE) led to the loss of patronage and donations. The prevailing view of decline of Buddhism in India is summed by A.L. Basham's classic study which argues that the main cause was the rise of an ancient Hindu religion again, \\"Hinduism\\", which focused on the worship of deities like Shiva and Vishnu and became more popular among the common people while Buddhism, being focused on monastery life, had become disconnected from public life and its life rituals, which were all left to Hindu Brahmins.  Religious competition  The growth of new forms of Hinduism (and to a lesser extent Jainism) was a key element in the decline in Buddhism in India, particularly in terms of diminishing financial support to Buddhist monasteries from laity and royalty. According to Hazra, Buddhism declined in part because of the rise of the Brahmins and their influence in socio-political process. The disintegration of central power also led to regionalisation of religiosity, and religious rivalry. Rural and devotional movements arose within Hinduism, along with Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Bhakti and Tantra, that competed with each other, as well as with numerous sects of Buddhism and Jainism. This fragmentation of power into feudal kingdoms was detrimental for Buddhism, as royal support shifted towards other communities and Brahmins developed a strong relationship with Indian states. Over time the new Indian dynasties which arose after the 7th and 8th centuries tended to support the Brahmanical ideology and Hinduism, and this conversion proved decisive. These new dynasties, all of which supported Brahmanical Hinduism, include \\"the Karkotas and Pratiharas of the north, the Rashtrakutas of the Deccan, and the Pandyas and Pallavas of the south\\" (the Pala Dynasty is one sole exception to these). One of the reasons of this conversion was that the brahmins were willing and able to aid in local administration, and they provided councillors, administrators and clerical staff. Moreover, brahmins had clear ideas about society, law and statecraft (and studied texts such as the Arthashastra and the Manusmriti) and could be more pragmatic than the Buddhists, whose religion was based on monastic renunciation and did not recognize that there was a special warrior class that was divinely ordained to use violence. As Johannes Bronkhorst notes, Buddhists could give \\"very little\\" practical advice in response to that of the Brahmins and Buddhist texts often speak ill of kings and royalty. Omvedt states that while Buddhist institutions tended to be less involved in politics, Hindu brahmins provided numerous services for Indian royalty: > At the higher level they provided legitimacy by creating genealogies and > origin mythologies identifying the kings as Kshatriyas and organising > impressive ceremonial functions that invested the king with all the > paraphernalia and mystique of Hindu royalty; at the lower level they > propagandised the mystique of social supremacy and political power. They > taught the population, they established ritual and priestly relations with > the prominent households of the region, they promulgated caste and the > rights of kings. Bronkhorst notes that some of the influence of the brahmins also derived from the fact that they were seen as powerful, because of their use of incantations and spells (mantras) as well as other sciences like astronomy, astrology, calendrics and divination. Many Buddhists refused to use such \\"sciences\\" and left them to brahmins, who also performed most of the rituals of the Indian states (as well as in places like Cambodia and Burma). This eventually led to further challenges for Buddhists: > Rulers gave financial support to Brahmans, took the responsibility of > enforcing varna laws and discriminating against ‘heretical’ sects, and > refused state protection to their persons and property—if they did not > actively murder and loot them themselves. Lars Fogelin argues that the concentration of the sangha into large monastic complexes like Nalanda was one of the contributing causes for the decline. He states that the Buddhists of these large monastic institutions became \\"largely divorced from day-to-day interaction with the laity, except as landlords over increasingly large monastic properties.\\" Padmanabh Jaini also notes that Buddhist laypersons are relatively neglected in the Buddhist literature, which produced only one text on lay life and not until the 11th century, while Jains produced around fifty texts on the life and conduct of a Jaina layperson.Jaini, Padmanabh S. (1980): “The disappearance of Buddhism and the survival of Jainism: a study in contrast.” Studies in History of Buddhism. Ed. A. K. Narain. Delhi: B. R. Publishing. Pp. 81–91. Reprint: Jaini, 2001: 139–53. These factors all slowly led to the replacement of Buddhism in the South and West of India by Hinduism and Jainism. Fogelin states that > While some small Buddhist centers still persisted in South and West India in > the eleventh and twelfth centuries, for the most part, both monastic and lay > Buddhism had been eclipsed and replaced by Hinduism and Jainism by the end > of the first millennium ce. Buddhist sources also mention violence against Buddhists by Hindu brahmins and kings. Hazra mentions that the eighth and ninth centuries saw \\"Brahminical hostilities towards Buddhism in South India.\\"Kanai Lal Hazra (1995). The Rise And Decline Of Buddhism In India. Munshiram Manoharlal. p. 356. . Xuanzang for example, mentions the destruction of Buddhist images by the Shaivite king Sashanka and Taranatha also mentions the destruction of temples by Brahmins.  Religious convergence and absorption  Buddha as Vishnu at Chennakesava Temple (Somanathapura). Buddhism's distinctiveness also diminished with the rise of Hindu sects. Though Mahayana writers were quite critical of Hinduism, the devotional cults of Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism likely seemed quite similar to laity, and the developing Tantrism of both religions were also similar. Also, \\"the increasingly esoteric nature\\" of both Hindu and Buddhist tantrism made it \\"incomprehensible to India's masses,\\" for whom Hindu devotionalism and the worldly power-oriented Nath Siddhas became a far better alternative. Buddhist ideas, and even the Buddha himself,Vinay Lal, Buddhism's Disappearance from India were absorbed and adapted into orthodox Hindu thought,Govind Chandra Pande (1994). Life and thought of Śaṅkarācārya. Motilal Banarsidass Publ. , . Source: (accessed: Friday, March 19, 2010), p.255; \\"The relationship of Śaṅkara to Buddhism has been the subject of considerable debate since ancient times. He has been hailed as the arch critic of Buddhism and the principal architect of its downfall in India. At the same time, he has been described as a Buddhist in disguise. Both these opinions have been expressed by ancient as well as modern authors—scholars, philosophers, historians, and sectaries.\\" while the differences between the two systems of thought were emphasized.KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, , pp. 246–249, from note 385 onwardsSteven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, , p. 64; Quote: \\"Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of ātman is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [Buddhist] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence.\\" Katie Javanaud (2013), Is The Buddhist 'No-Self' Doctrine Compatible With Pursuing Nirvana?, Philosophy NowJohn C. Plott et al. (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , p. 63, Quote: \\"The Buddhist schools reject any Ātman concept. As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism\\". Elements which medieval Hinduism adopted during this time included vegetarianism, a critique of animal sacrifices, a strong tradition of monasticism (founded by figures such as Shankara) and the adoption of the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu. On the other end of the spectrum, Buddhism slowly became more and more \\"Brahmanized\\", initially beginning with the adoption of Sanskrit as a means to defend their interests in royal courts. According to Bronkhorst, this move to the Sanskrit cultural world also brought with it numerous Brahmanical norms which now were adopted by the Sanskrit Buddhist culture (one example is the idea present in some Buddhist texts that the Buddha was a brahmin who knew the Vedas). Bronkhorst notes that with time, even the caste system became widely accepted \\"by all practical purposes\\" by Indian Buddhists (this survives among the Newar Buddhists of Nepal). Bronkhorst notes that eventually, a tendency developed to see Buddhism's past as having been dependent on Brahmanism and secondary to it. This idea, according to Bronkhorst, \\"may have acted like a Trojan horse, weakening this religion from within.\\" The political realities of the period also led some Buddhists to change their doctrines and practices. For example, some later texts such as the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra and the Sarvadurgatipariśodhana Tantra begin to speak of the importance of protecting Buddhist teachings and that killing is allowed if necessary for this reason. Later Buddhist literature also begins to see kings as bodhisattvas and their actions as being in line with the dharma (Buddhist kings like Devapala and Jayavarman VII also claimed this). Bronkhorst also thinks that the increase in the use of apotropaic rituals (including for the protection of the state and king) and spells (mantras) by 7th century Indian Buddhism is also a response to Brahmanical and Shaiva influence. These included fire sacrifices, which were performed under the rule of Buddhist king Dharmapala (r. c. 775–812). Alexis Sanderson has shown that Tantric Buddhism is filled with imperial imagery reflecting the realities of medieval India, and that in some ways work to sanctify that world. Perhaps because of these changes, Buddhism remained indebted to Brahmanical thought and practice now that it had adopted much of its worldview. Bronkhorst argues that these somewhat drastic changes \\"took them far from the ideas and practices they had adhered to during the early centuries of their religion, and dangerously close to their much-detested rivals.\\" These changes which brought Buddhism closer to Hinduism, eventually made it much easier for Buddhism to be absorbed into Hinduism. Patronage In ancient India, regardless of the religious beliefs of their kings, states usually treated all the important sects relatively even-handedly. This consisted of building monasteries and religious monuments, donating property such as the income of villages for the support of monks, and exempting donated property from taxation. Donations were most often made by private persons such as wealthy merchants and female relatives of the royal family, but there were periods when the state also gave its support and protection. In the case of Buddhism, this support was particularly important because of its high level of organisation and the reliance of monks on donations from the laity. State patronage of Buddhism took the form of land grant foundations. Numerous copper plate inscriptions from India as well as Tibetan and Chinese texts suggest that the patronage of Buddhism and Buddhist monasteries in medieval India was interrupted in periods of war and political change, but broadly continued in Hindu kingdoms from the start of the common era through the early first millennium CE. The Gupta kings built Buddhist temples such as the one at Kushinagara, and monastic universities such as those at Nalanda, as evidenced by records left by three Chinese visitors to India. Internal social- economic dynamics According to some scholars such as Lars Fogelin, the decline of Buddhism may be related to economic reasons, wherein the Buddhist monasteries with large land grants focused on non-material pursuits, self- isolation of the monasteries, loss in internal discipline in the sangha, and a failure to efficiently operate the land they owned. With the growing support for Hinduism and Jainism, Buddhist monasteries also gradually lost control of land revenue.  Islamic invasions and conquest (10th to 12th century) = Invasions  James Meston, depicts the Muslim Turkic general Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khilji's massacre of Buddhist monks in Bihar. Khaliji destroyed the Nalanda and Vikramshila universities during his raids across North Indian plains, massacring many Buddhist and Brahmin scholars. According to Peter Harvey: The Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent was the first great iconoclastic invasion into the Indian subcontinent.Levy, Robert I. Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal. Berkeley: University of California Press, c1990 1990. As early as the 8th century, Arab conquerors invaded present-day Pakistan. In a second wave, from the 11th through the 13th centuries, Turkic, Turkic-Mongolian and Mongolian Muslims overtook the northern Indian plains. The Persian traveller Al Biruni's memoirs suggest Buddhism had vanished from Ghazni (Afghanistan) and medieval Punjab region (northern Pakistan) by early 11th century. By the end of twelfth century, Buddhism had further disappeared, with the destruction of monasteries and stupas in medieval north-west and western Indian subcontinent (now Pakistan and north India).McLeod, John, \\"The History of India\\", Greenwood Press (2002), , pp. 41-42. The chronicler of Shahubuddin Ghori's forces records enthusiastically about attacks on the monks and students and victory against the non-Muslim infidels. The major centers of Buddhism were in north India and the direct path of the Muslim armies. As centers of wealth and non- Muslim religions they were targets Buddhist sources agree with this assessment. Taranatha in his History of Buddhism in India of 1608,Chap. XXVII- XLIV, Synopsis by Nalinaksha Dutt, Accounts of Pala, Sena kings, Vikramshila, Turushkas and status of Buddhism in India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia gives an account of the last few centuries of Buddhism, mainly in Eastern India. Mahayana Buddhism reached its zenith during the Pala dynasty period, a dynasty that ended with the Islamic invasion of the Gangetic plains. According to William Johnston, hundreds of Buddhist monasteries and shrines were destroyed, Buddhist texts were burnt by the Muslim armies, monks and nuns killed during the 12th and 13th centuries in the Gangetic plains region. The Islamic invasions plundered wealth and destroyed Buddhist images. The Buddhist university of Nalanda was mistaken for a fort because of the walled campus. The Buddhist monks who had been slaughtered were mistaken for Brahmins according to Minhaj-i-Siraj. The walled town, the Odantapuri monastery, was also conquered by his forces. Sumpa basing his account on that of Śākyaśrībhadra who was at Magadha in 1200, states that the Buddhist university complexes of Odantapuri and Vikramshila were also destroyed and the monks massacred.A Comprehensive History Of India, Vol. 4, Part 1, pp. 600 & 601. Muslim forces attacked the north-western regions of the Indian subcontinent many times.Historia Religionum: Handbook for the History of Religions By C. J. Bleeker, G. Widengren p. 381. Many places were destroyed and renamed. For example, Odantapuri's monasteries were destroyed in 1197 by Mohammed-bin- Bakhtiyar and the town was renamed. Likewise, Vikramashila was destroyed by the forces of Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji around 1200.Sanderson, Alexis. \\"The Śaiva Age: The Rise and Dominance of Śaivism during the Early Medieval Period.\\" In: Genesis and Development of Tantrism, edited by Shingo Einoo.

Many Buddhist monks fled to Nepal, Tibet, and South India to avoid the consequences of war.Islam at War: A History By Mark W. Walton, George F. Nafziger, Laurent W. Mbanda (p. 226) Tibetan pilgrim Chöjepal (1179-1264), who arrived in India in 1234, had to flee advancing Muslim troops multiple times, as they were sacking Buddhist sites.Roerich, G. 1959. Biography of Dharmasvamin (Chag lo tsa-ba Chos-rje- dpal): A Tibetan Monk Pilgrim. Patna: K. P. Jayaswal Research Institute. pp. 61–62, 64, 98. The north-west parts of the Indian subcontinent fell to Islamic control, and the consequent take over of land holdings of Buddhist monasteries removed one source of necessary support for the Buddhists, while the economic upheaval and new taxes on laity sapped the laity support of Buddhist monks. Not all monasteries were destroyed by the invasions (Somapuri, Lalitagiri, Udayagiri), but since these large Buddhist monastic complexes had become dependent on the patronage of local authorities, when this patronage dissipated, they were abandoned by the sangha. In the north-western parts of medieval India, the Himalayan regions, as well as regions bordering central Asia, Buddhism once facilitated trade relations, states Lars Fogelin. With the Islamic invasion and expansion, and central Asians adopting Islam, the trade route-derived financial support sources and the economic foundations of Buddhist monasteries declined, on which the survival and growth of Buddhism was based. The arrival of Islam removed the royal patronage to the monastic tradition of Buddhism, and the replacement of Buddhists in long-distance trade by the Muslims eroded the related sources of patronage.  Decline under Islamic rule  Ruins of Vikramashila, it was one of the most important centers of learning, during the Pala Empire, established by Emperor Dharmapala. Atiśa, the renowned pandita, is sometimes listed as a notable abbot. After the conquest, Buddhism largely disappeared from most of India, surviving in the Himalayan regions and south India. Abul Fazl stated that there was scarcely any trace of Buddhists left. When he visited Kashmir in 1597, he met with a few old men professing Buddhism, however, he 'saw none among the learned'. According to Randall Collins, Buddhism was already declining in India by the 12th century, but with the pillage by Muslim invaders it nearly became extinct in India in the 1200s. In the 13th century, states Craig Lockard, Buddhist monks in India escaped to Tibet to escape Islamic persecution; while the monks in western India, states Peter Harvey, escaped persecution by moving to south Indian Hindu kingdoms that were able to resist the Muslim power. Brief Muslim accounts and the one eye-witness account of Dharmasmavim in wake of the conquest during the 1230s talk about abandoned viharas being used as camps by the Turukshahs. Later historical traditions such as Taranatha's are mixed with legendary materials and summarised as \\"the Turukshah conquered the whole of Magadha and destroyed many monasteries and did much damage at Nalanda, such that many monks fled abroad\\" thereby bringing about a demise of Buddhism with their destruction of the Viharas. While the Muslims sacked the Buddhists viharas, the temples and stupas with little material value survived. After the collapse of monastic Buddhism, Buddhist sites were abandoned or reoccupied by other religious orders. In the absence of viharas and libraries, scholastic Buddhism and its practitioners migrated to the Himalayas, China and Southeast Asia. The devastation of agriculture also meant that many laypersons were unable to support Buddhist monks, who were easily identifiable and also vulnerable. As the Sangha died out in numerous areas, it lacked the ability to revive itself without more monks to perform ordinations. Peter Harvey concludes: > Between the alien Muslims, with their doctrinal justification of \\"holy war\\" > to spread the faith, and Hindus, closely identified with Indian culture and > with a more entrenched social dimension, the Buddhists were squeezed out of > existence. Lay Buddhists were left with a folk form of Buddhism, and > gradually merged into Hinduism, or converted to Islam. Buddhism, therefore, > died out in all but the fringes of its homeland, though it had long since > spread beyond it. Fogelin also notes that some elements of the Buddhist sangha moved to the Himalayas, China, and Southeast Asia, or they may have reverted to secular life or become wandering ascetics. In this environment, without monasteries and scholastic centers of their own, Buddhist ascetics and laypersons were eventually absorbed into the religious life of medieval India.  Survival of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent  Mahabodhi Temple, Bodh Gaya, before the 19th century restoration. Buddhist institutions survived in eastern India right until the Islamic invasion.

Indian Buddhism also survives among Newars of Nepal, who practice unique form of Vajrayana known as Newar Buddhism. While the Buddhist monastic centers like Nalanda had been sacked, the temples and stupas at pilgrimage sites (such as Bodh Gaya) didn't receive the same treatment. The reason these were left unharmed was because they were \\"not material legitimations of rival royal families\\". Inscriptions at Bodh Gaya show that the Mahabodhi temple was in some use till 14th century. According to the 17th century Tibetan Lama Taranatha's History of Buddhism in India, the temple was restored by a Bengali queen in the 15th century, later passing on to a landowner and becoming a Shaivite center.

This can also be seen from the fact that Buddhist priests were not present amidst learned divines that came to the Ibadat Khana of Akbar at Fatehpur Sikri. After the Islamization of Kashmir by sultans like Sikandar Butshikan, much of Hinduism was gone and a little of Buddhism remained. Fazl writes, \\"The third time that the writer accompanied His Majesty to the delightful valley of Kashmir, he met a few old men of this persuasion (Buddhism), but saw none among the learned.\\" \`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni mentions, \\"Moreover samanis and Brahmans managed to get frequent private audiences with His Majesty.\\" The term samani (Sanskrit: Sramana and Prakrit: Samana) refers to a devotee a monk.

According to the 1901 census of British India, which included modern Bangladesh, India, Burma, and Pakistan, the total population was 294.4 million, of which total Buddhists were 9.5 million. Excluding Burma's nearly 9.2 million Buddhists in 1901, this colonial-era census reported 0.3 million Buddhists in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan in the provinces, states and agencies of British India or about 0.1% of the total reported population.No. 7.-Distribution of Population according to Religion (Census of 1901), South Asia Library, University of Chicago The 1911 census reported a combined Buddhist population in British India, excluding Burma, of about 336,000 or about 0.1%.No. 7.-Distribution of Population according to Religion (Census of 1911), South Asia Library, University of Chicago File:Ladakh Monastery.jpgThikse Monastery is the largest gompa in Ladakh, built in the 1500s.

In 1891, the Sri Lankan (Sinhalese) pioneering Buddhist activist Don David Hewavitarane later to be world-renowned as Anagarika Dharmapala visited India. His campaign, in cooperation with American Theosophists such as Henry Steel Olcott and Madame Blavatsky, led to the revival of Buddhist pilgrimage sites along with the formation of the Maha Bodhi Society and Maha Bodhi Journal. His efforts increased awareness and raised funds to recover Buddhist holy sites in British occupied India, such as the Bodh Gaya in India and those in Burma. In the 1950s, B. R. Ambedkar pioneered the Dalit Buddhist movement in India for the Dalits. Dr. Ambedkar, on 14 October 1956 in Nagpur converted to Buddhism along with his 365,000 followers. Many other such mass-conversion ceremonies followed. Many converted employ the term \\"Navayana\\" (also known as \\"Ambedkarite Buddhism\\" or \\"Neo Buddhism\\") to designate the Dalit Buddhist movement, which started with Ambedkar's conversion. Now Marathi Buddhist is the largest Buddhist community in India. in 1959, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, escaped from Tibet to India along with numerous Tibetan refugees, and set up the government of Tibet in Exile in Dharamshala, India,The Dalai Lama: A Policy of Kindness By Sidney Piburn (p. 12) which is often referred to as \\"Little Lhasa\\", after the Tibetan capital city. Tibetan exiles numbering several thousand have since settled in the town. Most of these exiles live in Upper Dharamsala, or McLeod Ganj, where they established monasteries, temples, and schools. The town has become one of the centres of Buddhism in the world. The Buddhist population in the modern era nation of India grew at a decadal rate of 22.5% between 1901 and 1981, due to birth rates and conversions, or about the same rate as Hinduism, Jainism and Sikhism, but faster than Christianity (16.8%), and slower than Islam (30.7%). According to a 2010 Pew estimate, the total Buddhist population had increased to about 10 million in the nations created from British India. Of these, about 7.2% lived in Bangladesh, 92.5% in India and 0.2% in Pakistan.

Oklahoma City's history begins with the settlement of \\"unassigned lands\\" in the region in the 1880s, and continues with the city's development through statehood, World War I and the Oklahoma City bombing. Early history Map of Indian Territory (Oklahoma) 1889, showing Oklahoma as a station on a railroad line. Britannica 9th ed. Oklahoma City was first settled on April 22, 1889, when the area known as the \\"unassigned lands\\" (that is, land in Indian territory that had not been assigned to any tribes) was opened for settlement in an event known as \\"The Land Run\\".Wilson, Linda D. \\"\\", [ Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture]. (accessed January 26, 2010). Some 10,000 homesteaders settled the area now known as Oklahoma City; the population doubled between 1890 and 1900. Oklahoma City became the capital of Oklahoma on June 10, 1910, supplanting Guthrie, the territorial capital, as the population center and commercial hub of the new state. Early city leaders John Shartel, Anton Classen, James W. Maney and Henry Overholser helped grow the city, which developed an efficient trolley system, a major regional commercial center, a railway hub and had attracted several large meat packing plants along with other industry. The city, now with a population of 64,000, put in a petition to become the new state capital. A popular vote was held, with Governor Charles N. Haskell as one of the strongest advocates for Oklahoma City's candidacy, which Oklahoma City won. The vote was not popular among Guthrie civic leaders, though, and an unknown Oklahoma City booster, most likely from the OKC Chamber of Commerce, allegedly spirited the state seal away from the state capital at Guthrie in the middle of the night to ensure the transfer. The Oklahoma State Capitol was established at N.E. 23rd Street and Lincoln Boulevard.Savage, Cynthia.\\"\\", [Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture]. (accessed January 26, 2010). The capitol lacked a dome after its initial construction; it could not be added by the time the building was completed in 1919 due to lack of funds. A dome was finally added to the building in 2002. Pre World War II Map of Oklahoma City in 1920 The new city continued to grow at a steady rate until December 4, 1928, when oil was discovered in the city. Oil wells popped up everywhere, even on the south lawn on the capitol building, and the sudden influx of oil money within the city and throughout the state greatly accelerated the city's growth. While those who had made money during this early oil boom largely escaped the Depression, the majority of Americans and Oklahomans were not so lucky. By 1935, rural migrants and unemployed workers had built a massive shanty town (or \\"Hooverville\\" after president Herbert Hoover) on the south bank of the North Canadian River.Weisiger, Marsha L., \\", [ Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture] (accessed May 26, 2010). The river often flooded, bringing disease and misery to the people living there. As part of the \\"New Deal\\", the Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps greatly reduced the level of the river to prevent flooding (a move which would later become a problem for city leaders stuck with a nearly empty river) and built one of the first experiments with public housing in the country. A municipal-owned Elm Grove camp built in 1932 and which offered better amenities to residents who paid $1 a day or donated eight hours or labor. The camp was eliminated in 1933 because of a fear that it would attract more homeless residents to the city. A May Avenue Camp continued to exist in 1939. In 1933, the city planning commission recommended a policy restricting African Americans' ability to stay in white residential areas within the city (see sundown town). Postwar developments The Second World War and the growing war industries brought recovery to the nation and Oklahoma City, and the post war period saw Oklahoma City become a major hub in the national Interstate Highway System. Additionally, Tinker Air Force Base in Midwest City became the largest air depot in the country in the post war period, a fact which made Oklahoma City the likely target for a possible Soviet nuclear strike. As the civil rights era dawned, downtown Oklahoma City became the site of a revolution in civil rights tactics. History teacher Clara Luper and some of her students from nearby Douglass High School led the first \\"sit in\\" in American history to desegregate the lunch counter at a downtown department store in 1958.Decker, Stefanie Lee. \\"\\", [ Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture]. (accessed January 26, 2010). When they succeeded, the tactic was adopted throughout the country, notably by the young activists of SNCC. From February 3 to July 29, 1964, Oklahoma City was subjected to eight sonic booms per day in a controversial experiment known as the Oklahoma City sonic boom tests. The intent was to quantify the sociological and economic costs of a supersonic transport aircraft. The experiment resulted in 15,400 damage claims. The persistence of the experiment and the 94% rejection rate of damage claims led to turmoil at all levels of government and embroiled Senator Mike Monroney's office in a battle with the Federal Aviation Administration. The embarrassment over the Oklahoma City experiments partially contributed to the demise of the Boeing 2707 SST project seven years later. Decline and stagnation Bricktown Canal Landrun Statues. As the 1960s continued, however, Oklahoma City began to decline. By 1970, \\"white flight\\" and suburbanization had drained the life from the central business district and the surrounding areas. The oil beneath the city had begun to dry up, and property values declined. The city leaders then engaged in a disastrous program of \\"urban renewal\\" which succeeded primarily in demolishing much of the aging theater district. Despite popular conjecture, the impressive Biltmore Hotel was not originally targeted to be taken down by the Oklahoma City Urban Renewal Authority. Plans drawn up for downtown's redevelopment by I.M. Pei always assumed the building would remain open for business. After a $3 million renovation in the mid-1960s, the hotel was renamed the Sheraton-Oklahoma Hotel. But, the operation could not turn a profit, and in 1973, hotel owners agreed with the authority the building had outlived its useful life and needed to be demolished. The city had planned to build a massive shopping mall called \\"The Galleria\\" downtown, but money for renewal ran out before they could construct more than the parking garage for it. This left downtown Oklahoma City in even worse shape than it had been in, with vacant lots where Victorian brownstones once stood. The 1970s and 1980s were periods of stagnation for Oklahoma City proper (and was the case for almost all major cities in the United States) and periods of affluence and explosive development for the suburbs. With the exception of The Myriad Gardens, little was done to improve the inner city or the central business district during this time, even as the oil boom of the late 1970s brought a flood of money into the area. 1990s Oklahoma City skyline. By 1992, the city was in such dire need of improvement that it was losing jobs, population, and even air carriers to more attractive cities. With this in mind, Mayor Ron Norick pushed through a massive plan for capital improvements throughout downtown called the Metropolitan Area Projects Plan, or MAPS. MAPS called for a five-year, one-cent sales tax to fund a new ballpark, a canal through Bricktown, a new central library, a large indoor arena, renovations to the fairgrounds and the civic center, and a series of low water dams on the North Canadian River to make it attractive and accessible to small boats. Though still stinging from the failure of \\"urban renewal\\", the people of Oklahoma City passed the measure, eventually raising over 1 billion dollars for improvements to the city and bringing life back to the central city. Oklahoma City bombing At the Oklahoma City National Memorial. In the midst of this atmosphere of optimism and change, Timothy McVeigh drove a rented truck full of explosives to the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. The explosion killed 168 people (including 19 children) and injured more than 680, as well as damaging and destroying many surrounding buildings. Shariat & al. count only 167 killed \\"as a direct result of the bombing or during escape\\".

The site is now home to the Oklahoma City National Memorial. The memorial was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer, and Sven Berg and was dedicated by President Clinton on April 19, 2000, exactly five years after the bombing., National Park Service. (accessed June 5, 2009) Oklahoma City has since rebuilt, and except for the memorial, there is little evidence of the bombing. The Federal Bureau of Investigation led an investigation, known as OKBOMB, the largest criminal case in America's history (FBI agents conducted 28,000 interviews, amassed of evidence, and collected nearly one billion pieces of information). Special Agent in Charge Weldon L. Kennedy. commanded the largest crime task force since the investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The task force included 300 FBI agents, 200 officers from the Oklahoma City Police Department, 125 members of the Oklahoma National Guard, and 55 officers from the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety. 21st century As Oklahoma City moves through the 21st century, new changes continue to bring population, jobs, entertainment, and improvement. In 2004, a new Dell call center brought over 250 jobs, and plans to employ over 19,000 more jobs in the future. 2005 brought Oklahoma its first major league basketball franchise, the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets, followed by becoming the permanent home of the renamed Seattle NBA franchise, now the Oklahoma City Thunder, in 2008. Many other corporations are making Oklahoma City their home and the population is once again increasing at a very high rate. Also, a new addition to the downtown skyline, Devon Energy Center, was completed in 2012, with 52 stories and a height of 850 feet.

Background Learning that during his Battle of Valdevez against Alfonso VII of León, Muslim forces had attacked and destroyed Leiria and Trancoso. Afonso Henriques's anxiety at this incursion at his southern frontier hastened his negotiations with Alfonso VII of León, leading to the Treaty of Zamora and freeing Afonso Henriques's troops to deal with the Muslim attack. Battle Banner of arms of the count of Portugal Historians are divided as to the location of this battle. At the time, the name \\"Ourique\\" designated a large area south of Beja. Since 12th-century chroniclers were unfamiliar with the region where the battle took place, they might have decided to call the location \\"field of Ourique\\" for lack of a more precise term. Nonetheless, the great distance that separated Ourique from the Christian lines farther north has led some historians to suggest various localities in central Portugal, abandoning the traditional idea that the combat occurred in Ourique in the Alentejo. It would have been difficult for the then Count of Portugal, with a realm little beyond the Mondego River, to go all the way south to battle five Muslim kings. One plausible alternative is Vila Chã de Ourique, some from Santarém. However, incursions by Christian armies deep in Muslim territory were not unheard of. Alfonso VII had directed expeditions that had reached Cordoba and Seville, well beyond the limits of Castillian dominions, and in 1147 he managed to conquer the Mediterranean port of Almería, south of Granada. This was possible because the largest Almoravid armies were positioned at the frontier, while armies stationed in small towns would rather retreat into their castles than face a strong enemy force. It is feasible that Afonso led a raid into the Gharb, and then, while retreating, was intercepted by a sizable Almoravid force intending to crush his army and recover the spoils taken by the Portuguese. Before the battle, Count Afonso was hailed as rex (king) by his men in the Germanic fashion, by being lifted atop his shield by the leading nobles of Portugal. Despite the fact that the Christian Portuguese forces were strongly outnumbered, the Muslim armies were weakened by internal leadership problems, which led to Afonso Henriques's victory and subsequently his proclamation as King of the Portuguese, as Afonso I, with the support from his troops, vanquishing and slaying, so legend says, five Muslim kings. The earliest accounts provide little detail. In one account the Muslim forces are led by five kings (Life of St. Theotonius), while in another, they are under the command of one king, Ismar (Chronicles). In the more detailed Chronicle of the Goths, Ismar waited until Henriques penetrated into Muslim territory, then systematically sent his troops from Seville, Badajoz, Elvas, Évora, and Beja against the Portuguese count. It is thus possible that the five kings were actually the leaders of the Almoravid garrisons of each of the Andalusi cities, under the overall command of the Almoravid governor of Cordoba, Muhammad Az-Zubayr Ibn Umar. Further, the Portuguese forces were surrounded on the hilltop where they encamped, Ismar hosted knights, who were executed later by Henriques, and that the Muslim king escaped in defeat. Arabic and Spanish accounts do not clarify the circumstances, and they even confuse the issue, identifying the Ismar as, alternatively, Ismar Abuzicri or Ismar and Abuzicri, with later historians identifying Abu Zakariya, the governor of Santarém, as the protagonist. It is also likely that the numbers were inflated by the chroniclers from a large-scale raid to grand assault by Muslim forces. Aftermath Shortly after the battle, Afonso Henriques is said to have called for the first assembly of the estates-general () of Portugal at Lamego, where he was given the Crown from the Primate Archbishop of Braga, to confirm the Portuguese independence from the Kingdom of León. This was a patriotic falsification perpetuated by the clergy, nobility, and supporters who promoted the Restoration of Portuguese sovereignty and the claims of John IV, after the Iberian Union. The documents that refer to the estates-general were \\"deciphered\\" by Cistercian monks from the Monastery of Alcobaça to perpetuate the myth and justify the legitimacy of the Portuguese crown in the 17th century. The author of this falsification was Oliveira Marques, and even in 1632. there were misgivings about the validity of the chronicler's account or the existence of the Cortes of Lamego The account continued to support the notion that a meeting of the Cortes occurred in the Church of Santa Maria de Almacave, in Lamego, in 1143. During this meeting, after being acclaimed by estates-general, Afonso Henriques accepted a group of laws on royal succession and excluded the Castilian line of Kings from the Portuguese throne, made provisions for the nobility on justice and the independence of Portugal. However, even as Spanish jurists and diplomats later demonstrated that the document was not creditable, the Portuguese defended the authenticity of the account. Alexandre Herculano later recounted the patriotic re-imagining in his História de Portugal, which caused its own controversy, and was later perpetuated by the writings of Alfredo Pimenta (who defended the existence of the Cortes of Lamego). In commemoration of the Battle of Ourique, the first Portuguese coat-of-arms appeared that included five small shields, to represent the five defeated Muslim kings (from one interpretation), which was later challenged by many authors. Legend Afonso Henriques's vision of Jesus Christ and of the Guardian Angel of Portugal during the Battle of Ourique (1139) Some years later, the idea of a miraculous intervention in the battle by Saint James in favor of the Portuguese appeared in the chronicles of the battle. Saint James was widely venerated in Iberia (with a main center of veneration in Santiago de Compostela, in Galicia, where his tomb was believed to be), being generally seen as the . As a consequence of Portuguese independence this legend was embellished with time to distance the Portuguese from Spanish devotional practices and beliefs. Later interpretations replaced Saint James with Saint George and, finally, with Jesus Christ. In the legend, Afonso Henriques was visited before the battle by an old man who saw in a dream that Henriques would be victorious because God would intervene in his favour. He advised the nobleman to leave the encampment alone when he heard the bell of the local chapel. Riding off he was surprised by a ray of light that showed him (in one interpretation) the sign of the cross and Jesus Christ on a crucifix. Afonso Henriques knelt in its presence and heard the voice of Christ, who told him he would defeat the Almoravids, which he, through courage and his faith, succeeded the following day. The legend of the miracle of the Battle of Ourique served thus as a political instrument to defend Portuguese independence as divine will. Yet, the legend, possibly earlier, knows his first known record in the early 15th century by the monks of the Monastery of Santa Cruz, during the battles between John and the Kingdom of Castile. Some modern authors claim that it is a creation of the monks, or forged by these, while not presenting evidence to support their theory, being, according to others, a long popular and royal belief tradition. A Cristofania de Ourique Mito e Profecia - Manuel J. Gandra, Fundação Lusíada, 2002 It was in 1419 that the legend first appeared in the Crónica de Portugal and was accepted as fact until Alexandre Herculano reexamined the event, judging it a \\"pious fraud\\", in his investigation in the middle of the 19th century.

He was best known as an early collaborator of the Beatles (though the record was labelled as being with \\"The Beat Brothers\\"), one of two non-Beatles (the other being Billy Preston) to receive label performance credit on a record with the group, and the only non- Beatle to appear as lead singer on a Beatles recording which charted as a single. Biography Sheridan was born in Norwich, Norfolk, where he grew up at 2 Hansell Road in Thorpe St Andrew and attended the City of Norwich School. In his early life, Sheridan was influenced by his parents' interest in classical music, and by age seven, he had learned to play the violin. He eventually came to play guitar, and in 1956, formed his first band. He showed enough talent that he soon found himself playing in London's \\"Two I's\\" club for some six months straight. In 1958, aged 18, he began appearing on Oh Boy!, made by the ITV contractor ABC, playing electric guitar on such early rock classics as \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\", \\"Glad All Over\\", \\"Mighty Mighty Man\\" and \\"Oh, Boy!\\". He was soon employed backing a number of singers, reportedly including Gene Vincent and Conway Twitty while they were in England. In 1958 Johnny Foster sought to recruit Sheridan as a guitar player in Cliff Richard's backing band (soon renamed the Shadows), but after failing to find him at the 2i's Coffee Bar opted for another guitarist who was there, Hank Marvin. Early in 1960, he performed in a tour of the UK, along with Vincent and Eddie Cochran. On 16 April, Vincent and Cochran rebuffed his request to ride along with them to the next venue. He therefore escaped the road accident which would leave Cochran dead and Vincent badly injured.Martin Duffy. Are You Tony Sheridan? (RTÉ radio documentary), 17 July 2010. Sheridan played guitar for Cherry Wainer on her recording of \\"Happy Organ\\". Despite these successes, his penchant for being late, showing up without his guitar, etc., soon got him a reputation for having gone a bit \\"haywire\\", and cost him much of his professional standing in England. Providentially, an offer for a gig came from Bruno Koschmider's \\"Kaiserkeller\\" club in Hamburg, Germany for an English group to play there. Sheridan and others (including Colin \\"Melander\\" Crawley) joined an ad hoc group promptly dubbed \\"The Jets\\" and were put on the ship headed for Hamburg. As fate would have it, legal woes (i.e. lack of proper papers) caused \\"The Jets\\" to not last long, but Sheridan (and now-friend Crawley) were soon back onstage in Hamburg. While performing in Hamburg between 1960 and 1963, Sheridan employed various backup bands, most of which were really \\"pickup bands\\", or simply an amalgam of various musicians, rather than a group proper (though almost always including now bassist Colin \\"Melander\\" Crawley and usually top-pianist Roy Young). However, in 1961, the young Beatles (with their line-up at the time of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe and Pete Best) who had met and admired Sheridan during their first visit to Hamburg in 1960, and who worked with him on their second visit, became even closer. The Beatles sometimes backed Sheridan, who, in turn, often joined the Beatles during their own sets backing them on guitar. They even visited Sheridan's home and had jamming sessions in the back garden. When a colleague of German Polydor producer/A & R man Bert Kaempfert saw the pairing on stage, he suggested that Sheridan and the Beatles make some recordings together.Lewisohn, Mark: All These Years Volume 1:The Beatles Tune In, Little Brown, London 2013, Kaempfert viewed Sheridan as the one with \\"star\\" potential, and though they signed the Beatles to play on Sheridan's records their contract with them stipulated that the four Beatles (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Best) were insured to play on a minimum of two songs. Of the seven songs recorded during Sheridan's two-day-long sessions for Polydor in June 1961, at times the band behind Sheridan would be down to only two Beatles (Paul McCartney and Pete Best). And that conversely some say that only on their two solo songs do all four Beatles play (minus Sheridan), while Sheridan plays on all of his tracks. John Lennon's rhythm guitar is heard only on the two Beatle solo tracks (though his voice is heard in background vocals as well as his handclaps on Sheridan's tracks) (per \\"Beatles Deeper Undercover\\" by Kristopher Engelhardt, p. 302) These sessions produced Sheridan's \\"My Bonnie\\" and \\"The Saints\\", and the Beatles' \\"Ain't She Sweet\\" and \\"Cry for a Shadow\\" (formerly titled \\"Beatle Bop\\"), plus three other songs. Polydor's beliefs in Sheridan's coming stardom were so strong that they buried the two solo Beatle tracks until much later. Additionally John Lennon, Pete Best and Tony Sheridan all swore that there were several other Beatle tracks that were recorded during the two-day session, but they have not surfaced. In the Spring of 1962 in order to fulfill contractual obligations, the four surviving Beatles (plus Roy Young but without Sheridan) recorded an instrumental version of Sweet Georgia Brown; later, Sheridan cut his vocal overdub for the song while solo in the studio. (Reportedly \\"Swanee River\\" was also recorded by the Beatles and Roy Young, though Polydor released a version in 1962 on Sheridan's album My Bonnie; however, Polydor states they've never found this last recording). A newspaper story of the day also mentioned that Sheridan had recorded \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" with the Beatles as well for single release (it was also on his album as well). In 1962, after a series of singles (the first of which, \\"My Bonnie\\"/\\"The Saints\\" made it to number 5 in the German chart), the record was released in America on Decca with a black label and also in a pink label for demo play. The record has the distinction of being one of the most expensive collectible 45 rpm with the black label in mint condition selling for $15,000 in 2007 and the pink label selling for $3000. Ringo Starr briefly played in Sheridan's backing band during very early 1962, before returning to Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. Starr was reportedly unhappy with Sheridan performing songs he had not rehearsed with his band (other musicians made the same complaint, as well as about Sheridan's penchant for fist-fights).Infosite, Beatlesource.com; accessed 19 April 2015. Also in 1962, Polydor released the album My Bonnie across Germany. The word \\"Beatles\\" was judged to sound too similar to the Hamburgisch dialect word \\"Pidels\\" (pronounced \\"peedles\\"), the plural of a slang term for penis, hence the album was credited to \\"Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers\\". After the Beatles had gained fame, the album was re-released in the United Kingdom, with the credit altered to \\"Tony Sheridan and the Beatles\\". The Beatles' Hamburg studio recordings, as well as some live recordings from the same period, have been reissued many times. In the mid-1960s, Sheridan's musical style underwent a drastic transformation, away from his rock and roll roots and towards a more blues- and jazz-oriented sound. Though these recordings were praised by some, many fans of his earlier work felt wildly disappointed. This change was presaged by liner notes from his 1964 album Just a Little Bit of Tony Sheridan in which his musical preferences are listed as \\"jazz and classical\\" rather than rock. The liner notes also mention his wanting to visit the southern US \\"to hear at first hand the original negro music and experience the atmosphere that has been instrumental in creating negro jazz and the spiritual, for which he has a great liking.\\" Polydor continued releasing Tony Sheridan singles with German record producer Jimmy Bowien through 1967 (though they only ever released two albums by him). By 1967, Sheridan had become disillusioned with his Beatle-brought fame. As he was more concerned by the Vietnam War and the thought of further Communist aggression, as such Sheridan agreed to perform for the Allied troops. While in Vietnam however, the band that he had assembled was fired upon and one of the members was killed. For his work entertaining the Allies, Sheridan was made an honorary Captain of the United States Army. Due to the repeated shellings encountered there, Sheridan henceforth suffered a great sensitivity to the sounds of any kind of explosions, even fireworks. With his Polydor contract gone, Sheridan did what he could to survive. In the early 1970s, he managed to cut a single as a pop duo teamed with Carole Bell, and they toured Europe together with fair success. Following that phase he returned to playing in Germany (usually Hamburg) or London. The mid-1970s, saw him deejaying a West German radio programme of blues music, which was well-received. Somehow he then managed to record an entire live album of early rock classics, a number of which had been part of his and the young Beatles early live act but of which had never been recorded. In 1978 a record producer in America heard Sheridan's early Polydor recordings (with and without the young Beatles), and was impressed by Tony's singing and playing. Immediately Sheridan was offered and accepted the offer to come and record a whole studio album in Los Angeles. Elvis Presley's TCB Band, not working at the time, was hired to play on the album along with top bassist (and former Hamburg friend) Klaus Voormann. An album of rock classics plus a few country tunes resulted, but with no major label release, it was restricted to direct TV sales. Thus the possible prospect of a long American career in Las Vegas evaporated. In 1978, the Star Club was reopened, and Sheridan performed there along with Elvis Presley's TCB Band. In 1991, Joe Sunseri, Sheridan biographer and then-manager, completed Nobody's Child: The Tony Sheridan Story. However, due to a falling-out, the biography remained unpublished. A biography of Sheridan, titled The Teacher (), was eventually published in 2013 by Norfolk author Alan Mann, a childhood-friend of Sheridan. This book was essentially an email question and answer interview. While repeated probings by the author did bring out Sheridan's one time of two weeks spent in an English jail, aside from that the author unfortunately takes Sheridan's memory of things at total face value. On 13 August 2002, Sheridan released Vagabond, a collection largely of his own material, but also including a new cover version of \\"Skinny Minnie\\", a song he had years earlier recorded for his first album. Tony played guitar and sang for the Argentinian rock musician Charly Garcia. The album was called Influencia and it was released in 2002. In 2015, Colin \\"Melander\\" Crawley – Sheridan's former bassist, published another biography, Tony Sheridan – The One The Beatles Called \\"The Teacher\\"() . Of the two published biographies it definitely gives the most insight into Sheridan's major career of the early '60's. Personal life Sheridan lived in Seestermühe, a village north of Hamburg, and in addition to music, in his later life he was interested in heraldry and designed coats of arms. Sheridan was extremely secretive about his personal life, although it's known that he was married three times, lastly to Anna Sievers, and previously to Rosi Heitmann and to Hazel Byng. His friend and former bassist Crawley stated that in 1960 Sheridan confided that despite his mixed Irish-Catholic and Jewish background, he was at that point viewing himself as a Buddhist. Later Sheridan became a devotee of the guru Bhagwan Sri Rajneesh and lived in the 1980s at the guru's Rajneeshpuram commune in Oregon, United States. Death Tony Sheridan died on 16 February 2013 in Hamburg, after undergoing heart surgery.

Among his other works are Le Plaisir de rompre (The Pleasure of Breaking, 1898) and the posthumously published Huit Jours à la campagne (A Week in the Country, 1912). Early life The child of François Renard and Anna-Rose Colin, Renard was born in Châlons-du-Maine, Mayenne where his father was working on the construction of a railroad. Renard grew up in Chitry-les-Mines, (Nièvre). He had three older siblings including Amélie (born 1858), who died at a young age. A second sister was also named Amélie (born 1859). A third child, Maurice, was born before Pierre-Jules in 1862. Renard's childhood was characterized as difficult and sad (un grand silence roux or \\"a great ruddy silence\\"). Although he decided not to attend the prestigious École normale supérieure, love of literature would eventually dominate his life. From 1885–86, he served in the military in Bourges. Life and career On 28 April 1888, Renard married Marie Morneau. He and his wife lived at 43 rue du Rocher in the 8th Arrondissement of Paris. He began to frequent literary cafés and to contribute to Parisian newspapers. Among his steady friends were Alfred Capus and Lucien Guitry. Jules Renard wrote poems, short stories, short plays, novels and his famous Poil de carotte. He was elected mayor (maire) of Chitry on 15 May 1904 as the socialist candidate and became a member of the Académie Goncourt in 1907, thanks to Octave Mirbeau. He died of arteriosclerosis in Paris. Work Illustration for Poil de carotte (1902). Some of Jules Renard's works take their inspiration from the countryside he loved in the Nièvre region. His character portraits are sharp, ironic and sometimes cruel (in his Histoires naturelles he humanizes animals and animalizes men) and he was an active supporter of pacifism and anticlericalism (apparent in La Bigote). His Journal, 1887–1910 (published in 1925) is a masterpiece of introspection, irony, humor and nostalgia, and provides an important glimpse into the literary life. The English writer Somerset Maugham was influenced to publish his own well-known journals by the example of Renard. In the introduction to his own work A Writer's Notebook, Maugham wrote an apt summary of the virtues of Renard's journal: \\"The journal is wonderfully good reading. It is extremely amusing. It is witty and subtle and often wise...Jules Renard jotted down neat retorts and clever phrases, epigrams, things seen, the sayings of people and the look of them, descriptions of scenery, effects of sunshine and shadow, everything, in short, that could be of use to him when he sat down to write for publication.\\"http://daron- larson.squarespace.com/blog/2006/11/14/jules-renard.html The American novelist Gilbert Sorrentino based his 1994 work Red the Fiend on Renard's Poil de carotte. For a great part, the 2008 memoir Nothing to Be Frightened Of by the English novelist Julian Barnes is a homage to Jules Renard. Renard is one of several popular philosophers whose quotations appear on the road signs of Project HIMANK in the Ladakh region of northern India. On one such sign in the Nubra Valley, he is quoted as saying \\"Laziness is nothing more than the habit of resting before you get tired\\".

Chemainus is a community in the Chemainus Valley on the east coast of southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Founded as an unincorporated logging town in 1858, Chemainus is now famous for its 53 outdoor murals. This outdoor gallery has given birth to many businesses, including a theatre, antiques dealers, and eateries. The tourist industry stemming from the murals helped rejuvenate the town after its large sawmill closed in the early 1980s and was replaced by a smaller, more efficient, mill. Outdoor murals at Chemainus Chemainus Theatre The name Chemainus comes from the native shaman and prophet \\"Tsa-meeun-is\\" meaning broken chest. Legend says that the man survived a massive wound in his chest from an arrow in battle to become a powerful chief. His people took his name to identify their community, the Stz'uminus First Nation, formerly the Chemainus Indian Band. The railway arrived in the 1880s and by the early 1920s the town's population had ballooned to 600 persons. Chemainus was eventually designated a census populated area by Statistics Canada comprising the more built-up residential and commercial neighbourhoods. Its population had further grown to 3,035 residents by 2011. A larger more inclusive Chemainus area is customarily regarded as comprising part of the District of North Cowichan that lies north of the Chemainus River. This is the area covered by the Chemainus Advisory Committee set up as a consultation body by North Cowichan. Chemainus Secondary School is located in the town, and serves as a secondary school for students living in Chemainus, Crofton, and Saltair. A BC Ferry terminal is located in Chemainus, which provides service to Thetis Island and Penelakut Island (previously Kuper). On 13 January 2006, a Boeing 737 aircraft was sunk off the coast in order to build an artificial reef. The sinking was documented in \\"Sinking Wings\\", an episode of the Discovery Channel series, Mega Builders.  Economic development post-Fordism  Lumber stacked on the dock at Chemainus, on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, to be loaded on a freighter for export In the 1980s, British Columbia's forest industry experienced a period of deep recession, largely caused by a substantial decrease in demand and price of B.C. forest products. This decrease came as a consequence of increases in global competition within forest product markets, the reduction in B.C. forest stocks, the placing of tariffs on B.C. forest imports to the United States, issues regarding aboriginal land claims and the increased public support for environmental groups. Scholars view this recession more importantly as a representation of a larger structural shift from a Fordism economic production system underpinning many North American industries, toward one of Post- Fordism. Fordism is a system of production methods based on principles of specialized mass production technologies, aimed at capturing economies of scale. However, due to rising global competition, energy crises, stagflation and recession, Fordism began to unravel. Consequently, a new system of economic production, characterized by greater flexibility and the exploitation of economies of scope, known as Post-Fordism, began to emerge. This transition placed a heavy burden on coastal single-industry forest communities like Chemainus due to rising unemployment. At Chemainus, Post-Fordist restructuring of B.C.'s Forest industry resulted in a large overhaul of the local sawmill owned by the Macmillan Bloedel company (a CPR subsidiary). Automated, state- of-the-art machinery was installed which allowed for greater flexibility in producing a larger range of products and greater ease in meeting varied market demands. This restructuring however led to a reduction in the amount workers necessary for its operation: a decrease from about 600 workers to 145 workers. However, the declining forest industry in Chemainus has led to a drive to diversify the local economy. Chemainus has been successful in growing its tourist industry through the entrepreneurial activities of local citizens. Key projects include the revitalization of Chemainus' main street, through painting a series of large outdoor murals, as well as the construction of a shopping mall several miles away. Chemainus' geographical location, between Vancouver Island's largest cities, Victoria and Nanaimo, as well as its proximity to ferry terminals and the coast island highway has also contributed to the successful growth of tourism in the community. While tourism activities represent a new feature of Chemainus' economy, the forest industry is still the largest industry in the community. Chemainus' restructured sawmill is profitable, and newer developments such as Chemainus' industrial park have been completed, attracting a number of re-manufacturing firms including Plenks Wood Centre and Paulcan. Despite Chemainus being heralded as a rare case of successful economic redevelopment within small resource communities, there are still some uncertainties facing its continued development into the future. Some note that the initial redevelopment projects in Chemainus such as the painting of large murals and other revitalization projects depended on funding from the government. This funding has largely disappeared and some have observed a reduction of opportunities for entrepreneurialism.

This date, which is based on research published in Nature in 2014, is much earlier than previous estimates, and it was established through improved radiocarbon dating methods analyzing 40 sites from Spain to Russia.. Evidence for continued Neanderthal presence in the Iberian Peninsula at 37,000 years ago was published in 2017. Hypotheses on the fate of the Neanderthals include violence from encroaching anatomically modern humans, parasites and pathogens, competitive replacement, competitive exclusion, extinction by interbreeding with early modern human populations,Interbreeding took place in western Asia between about 65,000 and 47,000 years ago, see natural catastrophes, and failure or inability to adapt to climate change. It is unlikely that any one of these hypotheses is sufficient on its own; rather, multiple factors probably contributed to the demise of an already low population. Possible coexistence before extinction Neanderthal tools modern human tools In research published in Nature in 2014, an analysis of radiocarbon dates from forty Neanderthal sites from Spain to Russia found that the Neanderthals disappeared in Europe between 41,000 and 39,000 years ago with 95% probability. The study also found with the same probability that modern humans and Neanderthals overlapped in Europe for between 2,600 and 5,400 years. Modern humans reached Europe between 45,000 and 43,000 years ago. Improved radiocarbon dating published in 2015 indicates that Neanderthals disappeared around 40,000 years ago, which overturns older carbon dating which indicated that Neanderthals may have lived as recently as 24,000 years ago, including in refugia on the south coast of the Iberian peninsula such as Gorham's Cave. Zilhão et al. (2017) argue for pushing this date forward by some 3,000 years, to 37,000 years ago. Inter-stratification of Neanderthal and modern human remains has been suggested, but is disputed. Stone tools that have been proposed to be linked to Neanderthals have been found at Byzovya (:ru:Бызовая) in the polar Urals, and dated to 31,000 to 34,000 years ago. Possible cause of extinction=Violence Some authors have discussed the possibility that Neanderthal extinction was either precipitated or hastened by violent conflict with Homo sapiens. Violence in early hunter-gatherer societies usually occurred as a result of resource competition following natural disasters. It is therefore plausible to suggest that violence, including primitive warfare, would have transpired between the two human species. The hypothesis that early humans violently replaced Neanderthals was first proposed by French palaeontologist Marcellin Boule (the first person to publish an analysis of a Neanderthal) in 1912.Boule, M 1920, Les hommes fossiles, Masson, Paris. Parasites and pathogens Another possibility is the spread among the Neanderthal population of pathogens or parasites carried by Homo sapiens . Neanderthals would have limited immunity to diseases they had not been exposed to, so diseases carried into Europe by Homo sapiens could have been particularly lethal to them if Homo sapiens were relatively resistant. If it were relatively easy for pathogens to leap between these two similar species, perhaps because they lived in close proximity, then Homo sapiens would have provided a pool of individuals capable of infecting Neanderthals and potentially preventing the epidemic from burning itself out as Neanderthal population fell. On the other hand, the same mechanism could work in reverse, and the resistance of Homo sapiens to Neanderthal pathogens and parasites would need explanation. However, there is good reason to suppose that the net movement of novel human pathogens would have been overwhelmingly uni-directional, from Africa into the Eurasian landmass. The most common source of novel human pathogens (like HIV1 today) would have been our closest phylogenetic relatives, namely other primates, of which there were many in Africa but only one known species in Europe, the Barbary Macaque, and only a few species in Southern Asia. As a result, African populations of humans would have been exposed to, and developed resistance to, and become carriers of, more novel pathogens than their Eurasian cousins, with far-reaching consequences. The uni-directional movement of pathogens would have enforced a uni-directional movement of human populations out of Africa, and doomed the immunologically naïve indigenous populations of Eurasia whenever they encountered more recent emigrants out of Africa, and ensured that Africa remained the crucible of human evolution in spite of the widespread distribution of hominins over the highly variable geography of Eurasia. This putative \\"African advantage\\" would have persisted until the agricultural revolution 10,000 years ago in Eurasia, after which domesticated animals overtook other primates species as the most common source of novel human pathogens, replacing the \\"African advantage\\" with a \\"Eurasian advantage\\". The devastating effect of Eurasian pathogens on Native American populations in the historical era gives us some idea of the effect that modern humans may have had on the precursor populations of hominins in Eurasia 40,000 years ago. An examination of human and Neanderthal genomes and adaptations regarding pathogens or parasites may shed further light on this issue. Competitive replacement Sapiens and Neanderthal skulls = Species specific disadvantages = Slight competitive advantage on the part of modern humans has accounted for Neanderthals' decline on a timescale of thousands of years. Generally small and widely-dispersed fossil sites suggest that Neanderthals lived in less numerous and socially more isolated groups than contemporary Homo sapiens. Tools such as Mousterian flint stone flakes and Levallois points are remarkably sophisticated from the outset, yet they have a slow rate of variability and general technological inertia is noticeable during the entire fossil period. Artifacts are of utilitarian nature, and symbolic behavioral traits are undocumented before the arrival of modern humans in Europe around 40,000 to 35,000 years ago. Jared Diamond, supporter of competitive replacement, points out in his book The Third Chimpanzee that the replacement of Neanderthals by modern humans is comparable to patterns of behavior that occur whenever people with advanced technology clash with less advanced people.Diamond, J. (1992). The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal. New York: Harper Collins, p. 45. =Division of labor= In 2006, two anthropologists of the University of Arizona proposed an efficiency explanation for the demise of the Neanderthals.Nicholas Wade, \\"Neanderthal Women Joined Men in the Hunt\\", from The New York Times, 5 December 2006 In an article titled \\"What's a Mother to Do? The Division of Labor among Neanderthals and Modern Humans in Eurasia\\", it was posited that Neanderthal division of labor between the sexes was less developed than Middle paleolithic Homo sapiens. Both male and female Neanderthals participated in the single occupation of hunting big game, such as bison, deer, gazelles and wild horses. This hypothesis proposes that the Neanderthal's relative lack of labor division resulted in less efficient extraction of resources from the environment as compared to Homo sapiens. =Anatomical differences and running ability= Researchers such as Karen L. Steudel of the University of Wisconsin have highlighted the relationship of Neanderthal anatomy (shorter and stockier than that of modern humans) and the ability to run and the requirement of energy (30% more). Nevertheless, in the recent study, researchers Martin Hora and Vladimir Sladek of Charles University in Prague show that Neanderthal lower limb configuration, particularly the combination of robust knees, long heels and short lower limbs, increased the effective mechanical advantage of Neanderthal knee and ankle extensors, thus reducing the force needed and the energy spent for locomotion significantly. The walking cost of the Neanderthal male is now estimated to be 8–12% higher than that of anatomically modern males, whereas the walking cost of the Neanderthal female is considered to be virtually equal to that of anatomically modern females. Other researchers, like Yoel Rak, from Tel-Aviv University in Israel, have noted that the fossil records show that Neanderthal pelvises in comparison to modern human pelvises would have made it much harder for Neanderthals to absorb shocks and to bounce off from one step to the next, giving modern humans another advantage over Neanderthals in running and walking ability. However, Rak also notes that all archaic humans had wide pelvises, indicating that this is the ancestral morphology and that modern humans underwent a shift towards narrower pelvises in the late Pleistocene. =Modern humans' advantage in hunting warm climate animals= Pat Shipman, from Pennsylvania State University in the United States, argues that the domestication of the dog gave modern humans an advantage when hunting. The oldest remains of domesticated dogs were found in Belgium (31,700 BP) and in Siberia (33,000 BP). A survey of early sites of modern humans and Neanderthals with faunal remains across Spain, Portugal and France provided an overview of what modern humans and Neanderthals ate. Rabbit became more frequent, while large mammals – mainly eaten by the Neanderthals – became increasingly rare. In 2013, DNA testing on the \\"Altai dog\\", a paleolithic dog's remains from the Razboinichya Cave (Altai Mountains), has linked this 33,000-year-old dog with the present lineage of Canis lupus familiaris. Interbreeding Human- Neandertal mtDNA Neanderthal DNA extraction Interbreeding can only account for a certain degree of Neanderthal population decrease. A homogeneous absorption of an entire species is a rather unrealistic idea. This would also be counter to strict versions of the Recent African Origin, since it would imply that at least part of the genome of Europeans would descend from Neanderthals, whose ancestors left Africa at least 350,000 years ago. The most vocal proponent of the hybridization hypothesis is Erik Trinkaus of Washington University. Modern Humans, Neanderthals May Have Interbred; Humans and Neanderthals interbred Trinkaus claims various fossils as hybrid individuals, including the \\"child of Lagar Velho\\", a skeleton found at Lagar Velho in Portugal.; ; In a 2006 publication co-authored by Trinkaus, the fossils found in 1952 in the cave of Peștera Muierilor, Romania, are likewise claimed as hybrids. Genetic studies indicate some form of hybridization between archaic humans and modern humans had taken place after modern humans emerged from Africa. An estimated 1–4% of the DNA in Europeans and Asians (e.g. French, Chinese and Papua probands) is non-modern, and shared with ancient Neanderthal DNA rather than with sub- Saharan Africans (e.g. Yoruba and San probands). Modern-human findings in Abrigo do Lagar Velho, Portugal allegedly featuring Neanderthal admixtures have been published. However, the interpretation of the Portuguese specimen is disputed. Jordan, in his work Neanderthal, points out that without some interbreeding, certain features on some \\"modern\\" skulls of Eastern European Cro-Magnon heritage are hard to explain. In another study, researchers have recently found in Peştera Muierilor, Romania, remains of European humans from ~37,000–42,000 years agowho possessed mostly diagnostic \\"modern\\" anatomical features, but also had distinct Neanderthal features not present in ancestral modern humans in Africa, including a large bulge at the back of the skull, a more prominent projection around the elbow joint, and a narrow socket at the shoulder joint. The Neanderthal genome project published papers in 2010 and 2014 stating that Neanderthals contributed to the DNA of modern humans, including most humans outside sub-Saharan Africa, as well as a few populations in sub-Saharan Africa, through interbreeding, likely between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago.Brahic, Catherine. \\"Humanity's forgotten return to Africa revealed in DNA\\", The New Scientist (February 3, 2014). Recent studies also show that a few Neanderthals began mating with ancestors of modern humans long before the large \\"out of Africa migration\\" of the present day non-Africans, as early as 100,000 years ago. In 2016, research indicated that there were three distinct episodes of interbreeding between modern humans and Neanderthals: the first encounter involved the ancestors of non-African modern humans, probably soon after leaving Africa; the second, after the ancestral Melanesian group had branched off (and subsequently had a unique episode of interbreeding with Denisovans); and the third, involving the ancestors of East Asians only. While interbreeding is viewed as the most parsimonious interpretation of the genetic discoveries, the authors point out they cannot conclusively rule out an alternative scenario, in which the source population of non-African modern humans was already more closely related to Neanderthals than other Africans were, due to ancient genetic divisions within Africa. Among the genes shown to differ between present-day humans and Neanderthals were RPTN, SPAG17, CAN15, TTF1 and PCD16. Climate change Neanderthals went through a demographic crisis in Western Europe that seems to coincide with climate change that resulted in a period of extreme cold in Western Europe. \\"The fact that Neanderthals in Western Europe were nearly extinct, but then recovered long before they came into contact with modern humans came as a complete surprise to us,\\" said Love Dalén, associate professor at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm. If so, this would indicate that Neanderthals may have been very sensitive to climate change. =Natural catastrophe= A number of researchers have argued that the Campanian Ignimbrite Eruption, a volcanic eruption near Naples, Italy, about 39,280 ± 110 years ago (older estimate ~37,000 years), erupting about of magma ( bulk volume) contributed to the extinction of Neanderthal man. The argument has been developed by Golovanova et al. The hypothesis posits that although Neanderthals had encountered several Interglacials during 250,000 years in Europe, inability to adapt their hunting methods caused their extinction facing H. sapiens competition when Europe changed into a sparsely vegetated steppe and semi-desert during the last Ice Age.Climate Change Killed Neandertals, Study Says, National Geographic News Studies of sediment layers at Mezmaiskaya Cave suggest a severe reduction of plant pollen. The damage to plant life would have led to a corresponding decline in plant-eating mammals hunted by the Neanderthals.Neanderthal Apocalypse Documentary film, ZDF Enterprises, 2015.

De- policing represents a de facto police strike, in which the police withdraw an aspect of their crime prevention services. It is a practical police protest at perceived political interference in their day-to-day task of policing. Author Heather Mac Donald has offered another interpretation for the term \\"de- policing\\". In her book The War on Cops, she uses the term as the antithesis for pro-active policing in general. In the light of the 2014 killing of Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York and criticism of \\"broken windows\\" policing, MacDonald used the term de-policing to describe the NYPD's policy of backing away from actively pursuing stop-and-frisk procedures as a primary method of crime prevention. A 2017 FBI study suggested that law enforcement felt a \\"chill wind\\" after several high-profile police killings in recent years—especially the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The study noted the stance of politicians, the media, and the broader social movement making people feel that it was acceptable \\"to challenge and discredit law enforcement actions\\"; and proposed that these circumstances have demoralized police officers and led them to do less on the job. In a 2017 survey by Pew Research Center, 86% of police officers said they believed that police-involved fatalities of African Americans had made policing more difficult. Recent court decisions like Ligon and Floyd have also contributed to the atmosphere of de-policing in many American cities, but particularly New York City. Cities like Ferguson, Missouri and Baltimore, Maryland have been similarly affected due to what is perceived as unfair and aggressive policing in minority communities.

Until 2007, it was known as PestPatrol. This product is now offered by Total Defense, Inc. and has been named Total Defense Anti-Virus. History PestPatrol, Inc. was a Carlisle, PA based software company founded by Dr. David Stang and Robert Bales, which developed PestPatrol and released its first version in 2000. Originally called SaferSite, the company changed its name in 2002 to better reflect the focus of the company. PestPatrol was an anti-malware product, designed to protect a computer system against threats such as adware, spyware and viruses. It performed automated scans of a system's hard disks, Windows registry and other crucial system areas, and enabled manual scans for specific threats, selected from a very long list of known malicious software. Among its unique features were CookiePatrol, which purges spyware cookies, and KeyPatrol, which detects keyloggers. Unlike most anti-spyware programs designed for home use on a single desktop, PestPatrol also provided a solution for the network environments found in enterprises. Among the features that made it appealing for enterprise security administrators was the ability to manage networked desktops remotely. Early versions of the product were criticized for the poor user interface, described alternatively as something that \\"looks like an application that was ported from OS/2, with unclear buttons\\" or a \\"clunky, text-based UI\\", but the reviewers praised its malware detection and removal capabilities, stating \\"PestPatrol is the most effective anti-spyware system - short of a switch to Linux - that we've ever used\\". It was described by InfoWorld as \\"one of the most established brands in anti-spyware\\", and in 2002, it was selected as \\"Security product of year\\" by Network World, which cited its ability to detect and remove more than 60,000 types of malware, and its defenses against Remote Administration Tools (RATs). Billing itself as the \\"Authority in Spyware Protection,\\" it licensed its signature files for use in Yahoo! Companion and others. In 2003, along with other anti-spyware and anti-malware companies such as Webroot, Lavasoft and Aluria, it formed an industry consortium to fight malware called the Consortium of Antispyware Technology (COAST). Computer Associates (now CA Technologies) bought PestPatrol in 2004CA Buys Anti-Spyware Vendor and made it a part of its ' computer security line, which includes a virus scanner and a firewall. Using the newly acquired technology, CA created a bundle named CA Integrated Threat Management (ITM), which consisted of an anti-virus solution and the PestPatrol anti-spyware. Renamed CA Anti-Spyware in 2007, the program can be bought separately, or as part of CA Internet Security. In 2007, the CA Anti-Spyware team was instrumental in exposing the fact that Facebook was collecting personal information about their users, without their knowledge, even when those users opted out of Facebook's ill- fated Beacon program, and even when those users were not logged into Facebook.

It was first published in Strand Magazine in 1893 with original illustrations by Sidney Paget. One of Doyle's sentimental pieces, the story is remarkable in that Holmes' deduction during the course of it proves incorrect. According to Dr. Watson: > \\"...where he failed it happened too often that no one else succeeded... Now > and again, however, it chanced that even when he erred the truth was still > discovered.\\" Synopsis Sherlock Holmes, suffering from boredom due to a want of cases, returns home from a walk with Dr. Watson early in spring to find he has missed a visitor but that the caller has left his pipe behind. From it, Holmes deduces that he was disturbed of mind (because he forgot the pipe); that he valued it highly (because he had repaired, rather than replaced it, when it was broken); that he was muscular, left-handed, had excellent teeth, was careless in his habits and was well-off. None of these deductions is particularly germane to the story: they are merely Holmesian logical exercises. When the visitor, Mr. Grant Munro (whose name Holmes observed from his hatband) returns, Holmes and Watson hear the story of Munro's deception by his wife Effie. She had been previously married in America, but her husband and child had died of yellow fever, whereupon she returned to England and met and married Munro. Their marriage had been blissful--\\"We have not had a difference, not one, in thought, or word, or deed,\\" says Grant Munro--until she asked for a hundred pounds and begged him not to ask why. Two months later, Effie Munro was caught conducting secret liaisons with the occupants of a cottage near the Munro house in Norbury. Grant Munro has seen a mysterious yellow-faced person in this cottage. Overcome with jealousy, he breaks in and finds the place empty. However, the room where he saw the mysterious figure is very comfortable and well furnished, with a portrait of his wife on the mantelpiece. Holmes, after sending Munro home with instructions to wire for him if the cottage was reoccupied, confides in Watson his belief that the mysterious figure is Effie Munro's first husband. He postulates that the husband, having been left in America, has come to England to blackmail her. After Munro summons Holmes and Watson, the three enter the cottage, brushing aside the entreaties of Effie Munro. They find the strange yellow-faced character, and Holmes peels the face away, showing it to be a mask, and revealing a young girl who is half-black. It is then revealed that Effie Munro's first husband was John Hebron, an African-American lawyer; he did die in America, but their daughter, Lucy, survived. At the time Effie came to England, she could not bring Lucy with her, as the child was still ill enough that the transition might have exacerbated her state. But later, after she and Grant were married, Effie got word that Lucy was alive and well. Upon hearing of this, Effie became overcome with desire to see her child again, so she asked for the hundred pounds and used it to bring Lucy and her nurse to England, and installed them in the cottage near the Munro house. She feared, however, that Grant might stop loving her if he found out that she was the mother of a mixed race child, so all the while, she had made every endeavour to keep Lucy's existence a secret. Both Watson and Holmes are touched by Munro's response. Watson observes: > ...when [Munro's] answer came it was one of which I love to think. He lifted > the little child, kissed her, and then, still carrying her, he held his > other hand out to his wife and turned towards the door. \\"We can talk about > it more comfortably at home,\\" said he. \\"I am not a very good man, Effie, but > I think I am a better one than you have given me credit for being.\\" Holmes excuses himself and Watson, and, that evening, after they have returned to Baker Street, says: > \\"Watson, if it should ever strike you that I am getting a little > overconfident in my powers, or giving less pains to a case than it deserves, > kindly whisper 'Norbury' in my ear, and I shall be infinitely obliged to > you.\\"  Treatment of race  Doyle's sympathetic treatment of interracial marriage, between an Englishwoman and a black lawyer in Atlanta, Georgia, appears extraordinarily liberal for the 1890s. Though the story has the widow treating her dead husband's race as a secret whose revelation might entail negative reactions, the marriage is not illegal in Britain, and her second husband's loving response is reported approvingly by Watson. This story, however, should be set alongside Doyle's stereotyped caricature of a thuggish black boxer, in \\"The Adventure of the Three Gables\\" (1926).  Publication history  \\"The Adventure of the Yellow Face\\" was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in February 1893, and in the US in Harper's Weekly on 11 February 1893. It was also published in the US edition of The Strand Magazine in March 1893.Smith (2014), p. 76. The story was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand.Cawthorne (2011), p. 77. It was included in the short story collection The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.Cawthorne (2011), p. 75. Adaptations The story was adapted as a short film released in 1921 as part of the Stoll film series, featuring Eille Norwood as Holmes. Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the US radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes that was broadcast on 14 January 1932, with Richard Gordon as Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 41. \\"The Yellow Face\\" was dramatised by Gerry Jones for BBC Radio 4 in 1992 as an episode of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Helena Breck as Effie Munro. The story was adapted for radio in 2005 as part of the US Imagination Theatre radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. It was the first episode in the series. The story is also alluded to in the BBC television series Sherlock where a yellow smiley face is painted on the wall of Sherlock's flat.

He served in several important state legislative and judicial positions before serving in the U.S. Senate. Early life and career Ruggles was born in Westborough, Massachusetts. He attended public school there and in 1813 graduated from Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Ruggles studied law, and after being admitted to the bar in 1815 he began practicing in Skowhegan, Maine. Two years later, Ruggles moved to Thomaston. In 1823, Ruggles was elected to the Maine House of Representatives. He served in the House until 1831, and was speaker (1825-1829 and again in 1831). He resigned from the state house to replace Samuel E. Smith (who had been elected governor) as a justice of the supreme judicial court of Maine, serving until 1834. He also made the first US patent. The patent was for new traction wheels for trains for going uphill with heavy loads. U.S. Senate career The state legislature elected Ruggles as a Democratic-Republican (Jacksonian) to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Peleg Sprague. He was later elected for the full term beginning March 4, 1835, and in total served from January 20, 1835, to March 3, 1841. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1840. During his tenure in Congress, Ruggles had served as chairman of the Committee on Patents and Patent Office (25th Congress), and in 1836 framed the bill for the reorganization of the United States Patent Office. He was known for his interest in inventions and patents, and because of his legislative accomplishments in this area he has become known as the \\"Father of the U.S. Patent Office\\". Ruggles also was an inventor and the patent-holder of , issued July 13, 1836. His invention was a type of train wheel designed to reduce the adverse effects of the weather on the track. This was not the first patent ever from the USPTO; the previous patents were destroyed by fire and afterwards called the X-Patents, and new patents afterwards were numbered from 1 again. Ruggles received the first patent granted under the new system; Samuel Hopkins received the first X-Patent. Retirement and death In retirement, Ruggles resumed the practice of law in Thomaston. There he made several more inventions and was well known as a political writer and orator. Ruggles was wealthy; he and his wife Margaret George Ruggles had children and lived in the largest house on the town's Main Street. He died in 1874 a few months before reaching age 85. He is interred in the Elm Grove Cemetery.

In the series, the player is in charge of a fictional, newly conceived squad of U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers from Delta Company, 1st Battalion, 5th Special Forces Group (5th SFG) stationed at Fort Bragg. Except for the \\"1st Battalion, 5th SFG\\" designation, this reconnaissance unit is entirely fictional, as Special Forces Battalions currently only support three Companies (A, B and C). They are often referred to as \\"the Ghosts\\". Their role is like other real world special operations forces, in that their operations are kept highly classified. In Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, it is shown that the Ghost's unit has multiple designations and is part of JSOC; they are also known as the Group for Specialized Tactics (or GST—where the term \\"Ghost\\" comes from), much like real JSOC units such as Delta Force (1st SFOD-D or CAG) and SEAL Team Six (or DEVGRU). Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon has also been novelized by Grant Blackwood under the pseudonym David Michaels. Games=Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon (2001) Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon begins in April 2008, with civil unrest taking place in Russia. Ultra-nationalists have seized power with plans to rebuild the Soviet Union. Their first step is clandestine support of rebel forces in Georgia and the Baltic states. Alarmed by the threat, the U.S. deploys the Ghosts into Georgia to stop the Russians. Over the course of the campaign, the Ghosts take the fight to the ultra-nationalists, with a final showdown in Moscow's Red Square. =Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Desert Siege (2002)= Set six months after the first game, Tom Clancy's Desert Siege features a new campaign in East Africa, where the Ghosts have been deployed to stop Ethiopian army Colonel Tesfaye Wolde's plans to invade Eritrea. He executes his plan through arms sales with the same Russian ultra-nationalists who launched the coup the previous year. =Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Island Thunder (2002)= The second expansion set to Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Island Thunder takes place in Cuba in 2010. Its plot revolves around Cuba's first democratic elections since the 1950s, but an anti-American faction named the FDP (El Frente Democratico del Pueblo or People's Democratic Front), secretly terrorizes election outlets during the campaign while fielding their own presidential candidate. The Ghosts, who are sent to ensure order during the elections, discover that the FDP is a shell organization run by a Colombian drug cartel that needs the island as a transit point to the United States. =Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Jungle Storm (2004)= Taking place in Bogotá, Colombia just after the events of Island Thunder, the drug cartel that had aided and financed the FDP in their efforts in Cuba has initiated a number of terrorist attacks against the Colombian government, who have allied themselves with the United States. After Colombia's call for help following an attack on a U.S. embassy, America responds by deploying the Ghosts to restore order and put the cartel out of business. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 2 (2004) Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 2 is set in the Korean Peninsula. The settings of the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions (both of which are labeled 2007: First Contact) are linked with Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, particularly the sinking of the fictional intelligence-gathering vessel Clarence E. Walsh. They depict a new Korean War brought about by a renegade Korean People's Army general, Jung Chong-sun, who launches a coup against the North Korean government. The Xbox version is the direct sequel of the two games, in which Jung plots revenge against NATO and South Korea. Ghost Recon 2 also marks the debut of the series' main character, Capt Scott Mitchell. =Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 2: Summit Strike (2005)= An Afghan Uzbak warlord and arms dealer named Rahil carries out an assassination of Kazakshtan's president and Security Council, triggering a crisis where the Kazakh military splinters and vies for control.

The conga line is a novelty line dance that was derived from the Cuban carnival dance of the same name and became popular in the US in the 1930s and 1950s. The dancers form a long, processing line, which would usually turn into a circle. It has three shuffle steps on the beat, followed by a kick that is slightly ahead of the fourth beat. The conga, a term sometimes mistakenly believed to be derived from the African region of Congo, is both a lyrical and danceable genre, rooted in the music of carnival troupes or comparsas.Davis, Pablo Julian. \\"Conga\\", People, History, Culture of Cuba. Luis Martinel-Fernandez, D.H. Figneredo, Louis A. Perez, Jr. and Luis Gonzales. London, Westpoint Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2003. 396-397. Origin The conga dance was believed to have been brought over from Africa by slaves in the West Indies, and became a popular street dance in Cuba. The style was appropriated by politicians during the early years of republic in an attempt to appeal to the masses before election. During the Machado dictatorship in Cuba, Havana citizens were forbidden to dance the conga, because rival groups would work themselves to high excitement and explode into street fighting. When Fulgencio \\"El Checho\\" Batista became president in the 1940s, he permitted people to dance congas during elections, but a police permit was required.Orovio, Helio. Cuban music from A to Z. Durham: Duke University Press, 2004. 57. Description The conga dance style is more of a march, which is characterized by its distinctive conga drum rhythm. It differs from the Cuban rumba, which uses more hip movements and shows the sensually aggressive attitude of each dancer. Conga music is played with a staccato beat as its base, which gives rhythm to the movements of the dancers. Conga dancers lift their legs in time with the rhythm of the music, marking each beat with the strong motion of their body. The basic dance steps start from left leg 1-2-3 kick then repeat, opposite. Originally, a band member wearing a drum would venture onto the dance floor and begin zig-zagging around while drumming out the rhythm. Dancers would start joining up behind the drummer, forming a line that moved like a slithering snake in an open circle. The line (or the circular chain) would grow longer and the drumming more intense until it finally stopped. The dance has two styles, which is a single line form and partners. The single line is more popular in Cuba.  Western popularity  Beginning in the late 1930s and booming in the 1940s, it became wildly popular in the US, due in no small measure to Hollywood's \\"Latin\\" musicals. RKO Pictures' offerings were particularly influential, notably Too Many Girls (1940), in which Desi Arnaz appeared as a conga-playing Argentine student. Spanish-Catalan bandleader Xavier Cugat, who gave Arnaz his musical start, helped to popularize the dance, but the biggest impact belonged to Arnaz himself. It is prominently featured in the 1941 Deanna Durbin film, It Started With Eve, in which Durbin and Charles Laughton dance it together in a nightclub. With its simple march step, the interlinking of dancers circling about in single file, and one-two-three-bump rhythm with the fourth beat strongly marked, the dance was not only attractive but also readily accessible to US and other foreign audiences. The dance started to gain a foothold in the US around 1929, when the original La Conga nightclub opened its doors in Manhattan. It is believed that the La Conga was at Broadway and 51st Street. Watson, Sonny. \\"Conga\\", Street Swing. 1999. August 6, 2006 By 1937, the conga was well known in New York. The widespread popularity of the dance resulted in many cultural references in contemporary media. For example, the conga line was a recurring theme in Warner Bros. animated cartoons of the 1940s. This music and dance form has become totally assimilated into Cuba's musical heritage and has been used in many film soundtracks in the US and Mexico. One of the earliest and most successful of 20th-century Cuban musical exports, the conga lacked the polyrhythmic sophistication of the son, mambo, or salsa but served to nurture the future receptivity of an international public to the wider gamut of Cuban musical styles.  In popular culture  One of the earliest appearances is a scene at the Locarno Dance Hall in Manchester in the 1963 film Billy Liar. The video game Team Fortress 2 has adopted the conga as an in-game \\"taunt\\", and has become a notable feature in the game, often being parodied in fan-made content such as animations or add-ons to the game. The conga has been featured in countless films and TV series, though in most cases it was intended to serve as a distraction for the main characters to slip away silently. In 1984 the British band Black Lace reached number ten in the UK chartsEveryHit.com - search for \\"Black Lace\\" as \\"Name of artist\\" and \\"Do the Conga\\" as \\"Title of song\\". with the song \\"Do the Conga\\".

A Microsoft Windows version was planned but cancelled in April 2005 in favor of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter. It is a direct sequel to the 2001 video game Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon. The game takes place on the Korean Peninsula, with slight variations between platforms. The GameCube and PS2 campaign occurs in 2007, while the Xbox campaign is set in 2011. Ghost Recon 2 sports an updated graphics engine, the Havok 2 physics engine, new multiplayer options, and voice command ability via microphone. Gameplay In the single player campaign, the player assumes the role of Ghost Team leader, Captain Scott Mitchell; Mitchell is described as \\"a consummate soldier\\", being a veteran of several armed conflicts and can use weaponry from any soldier class, including assault rifles, carbines, submachine guns, sniper rifles and more. In several missions the player is inserted alone and must complete the mission without assistance from the other Ghosts. Such missions render assistance in the form of air strikes the player can call in. Multiplayer There are several variations of multiplayer mode in Ghost Recon 2. Co-operative games are available in the campaign mission, battle, defend, firefight, garrison, recon, and scout modes, in which players must work together to accomplish a single goal. Garrison mode, for example, is when players must keep enemy troops out of a marked area, for a designated time. Adversarial modes are divided into two categories; Solo, where players work separately, usually against one another, and Squad, where players are divided up into opposing teams. Plot The PlayStation 2 and GameCube release of the game has an entirely different plot from that of the Xbox version. It is also peripherally connected to the plot of Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. PlayStation 2/GameCube (2007: First Contact) In July 2007, North Korea faces heavy turmoil as a result of famine sweeping the country. In an attempt to repair the damage, the government redirects much of the military budget to civic projects. The reappropriation of the funds angers the Korean People's Army command, causing General Jung Chong-sun to plan a coup against the government and puts the military on high alert for combat across the DMZ. Since a Silkworm missile that sank the U.S. Navy intelligence-gathering ship USS Clarence E. Walsh (CG-80) came from a North Korean missile battery, the U.S. decides to deploy the Ghosts and attack behind North Korean lines. Also during this time Sam Fisher from Third echelon is on a mission determining if the North Koreans intentionally fired the Silkworm missile. The missions include raiding a North Korean airbase, going after a downed OH-58 Kiowa transport and preventing Jung's plan to blow up a dam just upstream from the DMZ. Having dealt the North Koreans sufficient damage, Pyongyang backs down. However, four months later, one of Jung's subordinates, General Paik, activates a Taepodong-2 missile loaded with multiple nuclear warheads and prepares to launch them against South Korea and NATO countries. The Ghosts are sent back into North Korea to destroy the missile. With the destruction of the missile, Paik commits suicide while Jung plots revenge. Xbox (2011: Final Assault) Having recovered from the setbacks of the first game, Jung leads the KPA in revolt once more and gains access to the North Korean nuclear arsenal. Now ready for revenge, Jung prepares to launch a new Korean War and involve other Asian countries in the chaos. NATO and the United States, plus Australia deploys a peacekeeping force to the region. The Ghosts head back to the theater for the third time and wreak havoc among the North Korean forces. Determined to fight the West and squash dissent among the North Korean populace, Jung attacks some of North Korea's largest cities, such as Sinpo and Hyesan. With the Ghosts' strikes sapping the North Koreans of fuel, Jung gets more desperate in winning the war, and in one mission, the Ghosts have to seize three nuclear warheads from a train before they reach civilian-populated areas. Now out of options, Jung leads the capture of a dam near Hamhung and installs a nuclear warhead. The Ghosts attack once more to stop the threat and eliminate the general. Expansion packs=Ghost Recon 2: Summit Strike Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 2: Summit Strike is a stand-alone expansion pack for Ghost Recon 2 available exclusively on the Xbox. Summit Strike included 11 new single-player missions, as well as new weapons (such as the FN SCAR) and an expanded multiplayer game. It was released on August 2, 2005. Reception By the end of 2004, after seven weeks of availability, Ghost Recon 2 had sold 1.4 million copies. Ghost Recon 2 was met with positive (Xbox) to very mixed reception (PS2 and Gamecube).

As a young man, he got into trouble with the law and was arrested several times. He was sentenced to death in 1970 after having been convicted of murdering his mother, although this sentence was later commuted to life in prison. While in prison, he remained a very active chess player, playing a large number of correspondence games and rated games with other inmates. Over time, he achieved a very high ranking in the United States Chess Federation (USCF) by playing in a closed pool, which the federation alleges was due to rating manipulation. He died in prison in 2001.  Early chess career  In 1955, Bloodgood played a number of chess games against actor Humphrey Bogart, who was a good amateur player. Bloodgood was an active chess organizer in Hampton Roads, Virginia in the late 1950s. He was the rating statistician for the Virginia State Chess Federation, where he rated himself at an Elo rating of 1956.  Prison career, chess and brief escape  In the early 1960s, he was twice convicted of burglary and served prison time in Delaware. He was also convicted of forgery of his parents' accounts, and spent more time in jail. In 1969, just nine days after being released from prison, he murdered his mother, Margaret Bloodgood (whom he later claimed to be his stepmother). According to reports, he rolled her body in a carpet and left it in Dismal Swamp, where it was soon found. His death sentence was ultimately commuted to life imprisonment after Furman v. Georgia, the 1972 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the death penalty, as then administered, was unconstitutional. From prison, Bloodgood played thousands of chess games by mail, as well as thousands with fellow inmates. He also published three books on chess openings, including The Tactical Grob (on 1.g4) . In 1974, Bloodgood and fellow inmate Lewis Capleaner received a furlough to play in a chess tournament. They overpowered the single guard assigned to them and escaped, but they were recaptured after a few days.  Legal challenges  Bloodgood filed two petitions for habeas corpus with the courts. His contention was that the death sentence, later commuted to life, was based in part on the fact that he was a repeat offender, having been convicted twice of burglary in Delaware. But these convictions had been obtained before the U.S. Supreme Court decision of Gideon v. Wainwright which guaranteed the right to counsel. He argued that since no defense attorney had been assigned to him in the Delaware cases, the two convictions were unconstitutional and thus the Virginia death sentence was unconstitutional as well. The courts rejected his contentions, resulting in decisions of the Virginia Supreme Court in Bloodgood v. Virginia and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Bloodgood v. Garraghty, 783 F.2d 470 (4th Cir. 1986).  High rank possibly via manipulation  Bloodgood organized chess games within Powhatan Correctional Center in Powhatan, Virginia, which were by necessity with fellow inmates.Chesscafe: Claude Bloodgood Many of these inmates were taught the game by Bloodgood, and thus began as unrated and inexperienced players. Bloodgood obtained USCF memberships for them. Some accused Bloodgood, with his intimate knowledge of the rating system, of rigging their ratings. The accusation was that he arranged for new prisoners to play rated games against other prisoners, who would deliberately lose, thus giving the new inmate an inflated USCF rating. Bloodgood, it is further alleged, then played rated games against the new highly rated prisoner, and each time he won, gained a few more rating points. This continued for several years, and by 1997 his rating rose to 2759, making the 59-year-old Bloodgood the second highest rated player in the nation, only behind Gata Kamsky. In comparison, at his retirement Bobby Fischer's rating was 2760, and several leading grandmasters were in the 2600s. This is all a matter of considerable controversy even today. Bloodgood himself vehemently denied these accusations, and said that he played chess in the only competitions available to him, prison tournaments, and won almost every game because he was the strongest player in the prison system. As his rating rose, he wrote the USCF to warn them that its system was prone to \\"closed pool\\" ratings inflation. But nothing was done until Bloodgood's rating skyrocketed. By virtue of his high rating, Bloodgood would have qualified for entry into the U.S. Chess Championship, a prestigious invitation-only event intended for the best 16 players in the country. This caused an investigation by the USCF, which debated extensively what to do about the situation. In the end, Bloodgood wasn't invited to the event (which he could not have attended anyway), and the USCF changed its ratings system rules to attempt to prevent \\"closed pool\\" ratings inflation from prison memberships.  Late prison career  Late in life, Bloodgood made a variety of claims that seemed designed to obtain a release from prison. For example, he claimed to have been born in 1924 and asked for a furlough based on old age. He claimed to have been born in Germany or Mexico and asked to be extradited to those countries or to be involved in prisoner exchange. He also claimed to have been a Nazi spy during World War II. He often gave interviews, trying to convince the interviewer that he was completely innocent of his crimes and a victim of mistaken identity. Bloodgood died in Powhatan Correctional Center of lung cancer on August 4, 2001.  Library  The Cleveland Public Library houses the Claude F. Bloodgood Collection,The Claude F.

The granddaughter and eventual heiress of the first Baron Maltravers, she married two barons in succession and passed her grandfather's title to her grandson.

After obtaining an annulment of the marriage, followed by a papal dispensation waiving their consanguinity, they married again on 29 September 1384..

A former editor of The New Republic, he has written for Time, The New York Times, The New York Review of Books among other periodicals, and is the author of three books. He is a professor of journalism and political science at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York. He is an editor-at-large at Jewish Currents, a contributor to The Atlantic, a political commentator for CNN, and a fellow at the Foundation for Middle East Peace. Early life and education Beinart was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1971. His parents were Jewish immigrants from South Africa (his maternal grandfather was from Russia, and his maternal grandmother, who was Sephardic, was from Egypt). His father's parents were from Lithuania. His mother, Doreen (née Pienaar), is a former director of the Harvard's Human Rights film series at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, and his father, Julian Beinart, is a former professor of architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His stepfather is theatre critic and playwright Robert Brustein. Beinart attended Buckingham Browne and Nichols School in Cambridge. He then studied history and political science at Yale University, where he was a member of the Yale Political Union, and graduated in 1993. He was a Rhodes Scholar at University College, Oxford University, where he earned an M.Phil. in international relations in 1995. Career Beinart worked at The New Republic as the managing editor from 1995 to 1997, then as senior editor till 1999, and as the magazine's editor from 1999 to 2006. For much of that time he also wrote The New Republics \\"TRB\\" column, which was reprinted in the New York Post and other newspapers. From 2007 till 2009 he was a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Beinart is a Professor of Journalism and Political Science at the City University of New York. He has written for Time, The New York Times, The New York Review of Books, and other periodicals. Beinart has appeared on various TV news discussion programs, and is a political commentator for CNN. His editor-in-chief at the Forward called him a \\"wunderkind\\". In March 2012, Beinart launched a new blog, \\"Open Zion\\", at Newsweek/The Daily Beast. He was also a senior political writer for The Daily Beast. In 2012, Beinart was included on Foreign Policy magazine's list of 100 top global thinkers. On November 4, 2013, Haaretz announced that Beinart would be hired as a columnist beginning January 1, 2014. The same day, the Atlantic Media Company said he would join National Journal and write for The Atlantic's website beginning in January. Beinart would cease operating his blog at The Daily Beast. He left Haaretz and became a columnist for the The Forward in January 2017, where he stayed until the beginning of 2020 when he joined Jewish Currents as an editor-at-large. In August 2018, Beinart said he was detained by Shin Bet at Israel's Ben Gurion Airport and questioned about his presence at West Bank protests and outspoken criticism of the Israeli government's policies toward the Palestinians. Beinart called his experience \\"trivial\\" when compared to the experiences of others, particularly Palestinians and Palestinian Americans who travel through Israel's main airport. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Israeli security forces and was told that Beinart's detention was an administrative mistake, and that the country \\"welcomes all—critics and supporters alike.\\" Works and views Beinart is the author of the 2006 book The Good Fight: Why Liberals—and Only Liberals—Can Win the War on Terror and Make America Great Again. Drawing upon the work of the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, Beinart argues that, paradoxically, the only way for America to distinguish itself from the predatory imperial powers of the past is to acknowledge its own capacity for evil. Beinart was a vocal supporter of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, but by 2006, as he published his first book, he \\"had concluded that it had been a tragic mistake\\". His second book, The Icarus Syndrome: A History of American Hubris, published in 2010, \\"look[ed] back at the past hundred years of U.S. foreign policy in the baleful light of recent events [and found] the ground littered with ... the remnants of large ideas and unearned confidence [as demonstrable in] a study of three needless wars\\", World War I, the Vietnam War, and the Iraq War. In his 2010 essay \\"The Failure of the American Jewish Establishment\\" in the New York Review of Books, Beinart argued that the tensions between liberalism and Zionism in the U.S. may tear the two concepts apart. He argued that by abetting Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories, American Jewish leaders risk alienating generations of younger American Jews who find the occupation morally wrong and incompatible with their liberal politics. He expanded on this argument in his 2012 book The Crisis of Zionism. In 2016 Beinart said that greater military engagement against ISIS could be detrimental to America. Beinart also attracted criticism for proposing that America secure peace in East Asia by allowing Mainland China to take control of Taiwan. In a 2018 essay in The Atlantic, Beinart wrote that Trump voters care more about murder by illegal immigrants than about the cover-up of the Trump's affairs. He also wrote in 2018 that there is rising authoritarian nationalism in many countries with diverse situations. The conditions include both booming and poor economies, with only some concerned about immigration. He said the true common thread among right-wing autocrats is both a hostility to liberal democracy and the desire to subordinate women. In a 2020 essay, Beinart rejected the two- state solution in favor of a one-state solution, and he delved into the details in a longer essay in Jewish Currents. Beinart followed this essay with a shorter opinion piece for the New York Times, \\"I No Longer Believe in a Jewish State.\\" He argued that the two-state model has become untenable and that Israel's permanent control over millions of Palestinians who lack basic rights will result in war, and perhaps even ethnic cleansing. Israel and Palestine, Beinart wrote, should instead work toward creating a fully democratic binational state representing both Jewish and Palestinian identity, along the lines of Belgium or Northern Ireland following the Good Friday Agreement. Its time for the Jewish community to turn the page, he argued; the outdated \\"Holocaust lens\\" through which it views the world and in which a sovereign Jewish state is required to prevent a second Holocaust, merely causes suffering to both Israelis and Palestinians. Subsequent commentary in the media ranged from outright praise of the essay to allegations of dishonesty: author Daniel Gordis wrote, “Beinart strings together an astonishing array of sleights of hand and misrepresentations ... little more than a screed that is an insult to the intelligence of his readers.\\" Personal life Since 2003, Beinart has been married to Diana Robin Hartstein, a lawyer. They live with their two children in New York City. He keeps kosher, regularly attends an Orthodox synagogue, and sends his children to a Jewish school.

Background Hammershaimb was born in Sandavágur on the island of Vágar in the Faroe Islands. He was a Lutheran parish priest in Kvívík and a rural dean in Nes, on the Faroese island of Eysturoy, before settling in Denmark in 1878. In addition to his contributions to the written standard of Faroese, he was also a known folklorist. During the years 1847-48, and again in 1853, he returned to the Faroes to study the dialects and to collect the native ballads and folklore, which he published in 1851-55 under the title of Færöiske Kvæder. In 1854, he published a grammar of Faroese.Oskar Bandle et al., The Nordic Languages: An International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages, volume 2, Handbücher zur Sprach- und Kommunikationswissenschaft 22.2, Berlin/New York: Mouton de Gruyter, 2005, , p. 1463. Faroese language At one point, the language spoken in the Faroe Islands was Old West Norse, which Norwegian settlers had brought with them.Faroese 101: History at 101Languages.net Between the 9th and the 15th centuries, a distinct Faroese language evolved, although it was still intelligible to speakers of Old West Norse. It would have been closely related to the Norn language of Orkney and Shetland. However, for some 300 years until the 19th century, under the dual kingdom of Denmark–Norway, Danish was the language of religion, education, and administration in the Faroe Islands. Hammershaimb created his spelling system for Faroese in 1846.Faroese (Føroyskt) at Omniglot: Writing Systems & Languages of the World It was etymological, with the vowels based on written Icelandic, rather than phonetically descriptive (as in for example Welsh.) For instance, the letter Eth (Ð) has no phonemes attached to it. In this Hammershaimb had accepted the advice of the Icelandic independence leader Jón Sigurðsson, who had seen the manuscript for his \\"Bemerkninger med Hensyn til den Færøiske Udtale\\" (Notes with Respect to Faroese Pronunciation); Hammershaimb considered that despite its artificiality, this was the only approach that would overcome the problems of differing dialects in the islands.Bandle et al., p. 1415. Hammershaimb's orthography met with some opposition for its complexity. In 1889 Jakob Jakobsen proposed modifying Hammershaimb's system to bring it closer to the spoken language, but a committee charged with considering the proposal in 1895 advocated only minor revisions, and Hammershaimb's orthography remained in force. In 1886-91 Hammershaimb published his principal work, Færøsk Anthologi; it incorporated an account of the islands and their inhabitants, a variety of prose and verse in the Faroese language, and a grammar, and in the second volume a lexicon by Jakobsen. Literature in Faroese A new, national written literature in Faroese became possible only after the language's orthography was normalized. Its development was promoted by nationalist agitation, which hastened the restoration of the Faroese Parliament in 1852 and the end of the Danish royal trade monopoly in 1856. During the late 19th century modern Faroese literature began to appear and the first Faroese newspaper, Føringatíðindi, appeared in 1890. Faroese literature came into its own after the turn of the 20th century. After World War II, Faroese became the official language of the Faroe Islands.

Format Toughman Contest formats vary from state to state and are configured to each particular state’s rules and regulations. The most common format prescribes the use of standard amateur boxing rules, 16 ounces for each glove, protective headgear, and bouts made of 3 rounds of boxing. Each round is 2 minute with a 60-second rest period or interval for men and 1 minute rounds with 1 minute or 45-second intervals for women. The Original Toughman Contest plays across the US in between 75 and 100 cities each year and culminates with the World Championship. Toughman Contest tournaments feature the local residents of a particular city (generally, participants must live within 100–150 mile radius of where the event is to be held). Contestants must be at least 18 years of age, pass a standard boxing physical, and meet any other requirements of the state's boxing commission's regulations, and also sign a waiver freeing the parent company from liability. Some states, like Florida and Missouri, do not sanction the Toughman Contest and other amateur boxing contests unless it is under the rules and regulations of the USAAB. History The Toughman Contest was started in 1979 by Art Dore and Dean Oswald in Bay City, Michigan. Dore and Oswald wanted to prove how tough they were and opened it up to their friends determine who was the toughest. The Toughman Contest spread quickly. In its heyday, Toughman Contests were held at Las Vegas Casinos and broadcast live on multiple networks. Fox and the FX aired weekly Toughman Contest shows from 2000 to 2004 featuring Matt Vasgersian and Lawrence Taylor as commentators. At its peak, 135 Toughman shows were conducted around the US in 2001. Toughman Contest is the most widely attended boxing series in the United States in the last three decades. Dozens of Toughman contests continue be held as annual events in West Virginia, Ohio, and Oklahoma. In culture The 1983 film Tough Enough, starring Dennis Quaid, features a Toughman Contest. Dore served as a technical advisor and inspired the character played by Warren Oates. In 1995, Toughman licensed a video game for the Sega Genesis called Toughman Contest. Deaths and controversy In 2003, Toughman faced public scrutiny following the death of Stacy Young in a \\"Toughwoman\\" bout staged as part of a Toughman competition in Sarasota, Florida. Young was a last-minute entry and faced Sara Kobie in the ring. Kobie's hits on Young led to Young's death from brain injuries. Young's family sued the Toughman company. The following year, Florida enacted the Stacy Young Act into law, requiring such competitions be sanctioned by the Florida State Boxing Commission. A 2007 review of boxing deaths documented six fatalities in \\"Original Toughman\\" competitions since 1979, and another ten in \\"Toughman-style\\" bouts.

The ride, meant to evoke a futuristic rapid transit system, opened in 1998 on the existing PeopleMover infrastructure as part of the New Tomorrowland project. Plagued with technical problems, Rocket Rods closed permanently in September 2000 after a little over two years of intermittent operation. While Rocket Rods' queue was replaced with Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters in 2005, the majority of the track infrastructure utilized by both the attraction and its predecessor sit visibly derelict throughout Tomorrowland as of 2020. The Ride Opening on May 22, 1998 as part of the New Tomorrowland, this high-speed attraction ran on a renovated PeopleMover track. Riders entered the attraction through the former Circle- Vision 360° building at the front of Tomorrowland. Guests boarded an unusual 5-seat Rocket Rod before moving forward to a staging area similar to one used for drag racing. In front of the riders were lights changing from red, to yellow, to green, the vehicles would then zoom down a straightaway toward the entrance of Tomorrowland, before quickly decelerating at the curve in the track. When the attraction was first opened, the straightaway was used for a small wheelie as well. During the development phase, Disney was unable to obtain sponsors to aid in the funding of the attraction; thus, the turns were not banked, requiring sudden deceleration followed by acceleration. The ride traversed the building housing Star Tours, Star Trader and the Starcade, offering views of all three through glass panes in the tunnel. Segments of the tunnel were entirely opaque, and one turn used a mirror to create the effect of nearly colliding with another oncoming ride vehicle. Afterwards, the Rocket Rod took guests into Space Mountain, during which the riders could catch a brief glimpse of the ride. The vehicle then took riders outside again before entering the Carousel Theater, home of Innoventions. Due to the long, slightly curved nature of this stretch of track, the Rocket Rods were able to accelerate to a comparatively high speed here. After leaving the other side of Innoventions, the vehicle took riders through a series of turns and dips above Autopia and the Submarine Voyage, which closed only a few months after the opening of Rocket Rods. Finally, the vehicle passed next to the Disneyland Monorail station before entering the Rocket Rods queue building, where a strobe light flashed and a blast of air shot out at the riders. The vehicle then traveled along the straightaway from the first leg of the ride back to the station. Rocket Rods was the first Disneyland attraction to house a Single Rider line due to its long lines and limited capacity. Queue The queue for Rocket Rods was located in the former CircleVision 360° theater which housed America the Beautiful and Wonders of China. In the first room, large blueprints of old and current Tomorrowland attractions adorned the walls, along with former Tomorrowland attraction vehicles, which were repainted blue with an orange grid to mimic a blueprint appearance. Four PeopleMover cars, two rockets from Rocket Jets, a Space Mountain rocket, and the front of a Mark III Disneyland Monorail were included in the queue of the ride. Near the end of the room was a video screen that displayed Walt Disney animated segments from the 1950s—1970s, which featured Walt's ideas of future transportation. All of the segments featured what many consider far-fetched or nearly impossible concepts of future transportation systems, such as fully automated and auto-guided mobile homes and cars using anti-gravity or magnetic devices to scale walls and objects. Each segment concluded with a short narrated segment explaining how these technologies evolved into forms of transportation used in 1998, or expected to be used in the future. The short narrations brought insight to the animated segments and explained to guests that \\"in the world of creativity there's no end to the possibilities\\" (the theme of the ride itself.) The next room of the queue was the original nine-screen Circle- Vision 360° theater, where guests watched transportation videos, excerpts from the Circle-Vision 360° films \\"America the Beautiful\\" and \\"The Timekeeper\\" put between a Walt Disney narrated video, and a video depicting the evolution of General Motors cars. Guests then continued through the \\"transit tunnel\\" (formerly a backstage area) where guests passed \\"proposals\\" for extending the Rocket Rods system to the nearest commercial airport, John Wayne Airport and other nearby destinations. The Transit Tunnel led to a series of stairs that circled around the inside of the tower that held the Rocket Rods platform and the Observatron (the former location of the Rocket Jets attraction.) The stairs led guests to the elevated Rocket Rods station in the center of Tomorrowland. In the queue area, near the stairway to the boarding area was a fictional map titled Rocket Rods Proposed System Expansion, showing guests where Rocket Rods was to expand in the future. The map was for fun, and had no actual locations on it (as well as ambiguous ones), including Tomorrowland attractions already bypassed by the Rocket Rods' route, such as: *Star Tours *Space Mountain *Innoventions *Disney California Adventure *Disneyland Resort Hotels *Edison International Field *Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim *Walt Disney Studios, Burbank *Los Angeles neighborhood Hollywood *John Wayne Airport *The beach *The mountains Music The evolution of GM cars video featured an electronic version of the Steppenwolf hit \\"Born to Be Wild\\", arranged and recorded by former Oingo Boingo member Steve Bartek. In addition to the re- arranged version of \\"Born to Be Wild,\\" the attraction featured its own theme song: \\"World of Creativity (Magic Highways of Tomorrow)\\" also arranged and performed by Steve Bartek. The song, originally known as \\"Detroit\\" from the 1967 Disney film The Happiest Millionaire, was composed by Robert and Richard Sherman. Demise and closure On July 6, 1998, just a little over a month after its grand opening, Rocket Rods was closed for refurbishment due to mechanical problems. It was reported to remain closed for five weeks, but it ended up staying closed for three months before reopening in October 1998. Rocket Rods closed again on September 25, 2000 for a refurbishment that was to last until Spring 2001, but no work was ever seen on the attraction.Disney's Rocket Rods Ride to Be Closed for Maintenance On April 28, 2001, the Los Angeles Times and The Orange County Register reported that Rocket Rods would never reopen.Disneyland Officials Confirm Closure of Rocket Rods The support structure originally designed for the PeopleMover was not suitable for the much greater speed and weight of the Rocket Rods ride vehicles, which caused the structure to weaken. The constant changes of speed in the ride often caused malfunctions, resulting in frequent closures of the ride and was one of the main reasons why the attraction permanently closed. The queue building is now used for Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters. Most of the Rocket Rods vehicles were scrapped after the closure, but it is unknown exactly how many were kept. One vehicle was placed in front of the Hollywood & Dine restaurant at Disney California Adventure where it remained for a few months. It was gone by the spring of 2002. Another vehicle ended up in the collection of Richard Kraft, and was listed for auction in late August 2018.

His career also included periods at Bethlehem Records, ABC-Paramount (including their jazz label, Impulse!), Verve, and A&M; Records. In the 1960s, he signed bossa nova artists from Brazil to record in the US, such as Antonio Carlos Jobim, Eumir Deodato, João Gilberto and Astrud Gilberto, among others. Biography leftthumbCreed Taylor, trumpet, with Ed Beuluki, alto sax; Ken Horton, bass; Art Steuer, drums; Francis Farley, piano: The Five Dukes, 1950; courtesy ctijazz.com. Early work Taylor was born and spent his childhood in Pearisburg, Virginia, where he played trumpet in the high school marching band and symphony orchestra. Although he grew up surrounded by country music and bluegrass, he gravitated more toward the sounds of jazz, citing Dizzy Gillespie as a source of inspiration during his high school years. Taylor recalls spending many evenings beside a small radio, listening to Symphony Sid's live broadcasts from Birdland in New York City.Interview with Creed Taylor , 2008. After high school, Taylor completed an undergraduate degree in psychology from Duke University in 1951 while actively performing with the student jazz ensembles the Duke Ambassadors and the Five Dukes. Taylor credits Duke's strong tradition of student-led jazz ensembles, and Les Brown's association with Duke in particular, as initially drawing him to the university. As he recalls, \\"The reason I went to Duke was from hearing Les Brown and all the history of the bands who went through Duke. This was really a great jazz band, . . . and the book was handed down from one class to the next, you had to audition and all the best players who came to Duke got in the band. . . . I had a ball when I was there.\\" After graduating from Duke, Taylor spent two years in the Marines before returning to Duke for a year of graduate study. The Bethlehem years Shortly thereafter, Taylor relocated to New York City in order to pursue his dream of becoming a record producer. Although he had no formal training at the time in record production, he recalls his \\"mix of naivete and positive thinking\\" that convinced him that he could succeed.Creed Taylor Interview, 2008 After arriving in NYC, Taylor approached another Duke University alum who was running Bethlehem Records. Taylor convinced Bethlehem Records to allow him to record the vocalist Chris Connor with the trio of pianist Ellis Larkins. Due in part to the album's success, Taylor became head of artists and repertoire for Bethlehem Records. He was at Bethlehem during its two most significant years, recording such artists as Oscar Pettiford, Ruby Braff, Carmen McRae, Charles Mingus, Herbie Mann, Charlie Shavers, and the J.J. Johnson-Kai Winding Quintet. The ABC- Paramount years In 1956 Taylor left Bethlehem to join ABC-Paramount, where four years later he founded the subsidiary label Impulse!. Motivated by the idea of a label dedicated to tasteful, current jazz, Taylor worked with ABC- Paramount executive Harry Levine to advocate for the label, which he dubbed \\"The New Wave in Jazz\\". It was Taylor who signed John Coltrane to Impulse!, rather than Coltrane's better known producer at the label, Bob Thiele. Taylor's accomplishments during this period also included gaining immediate credibility for the label by releasing successful gate-fold albums by Ray Charles, Gil Evans, Kai Winding and J.J. Johnson and Oliver Nelson. Taylor was sensitive to the importance of album cover design for visually drawing people to the music, and he regularly hired photographers Pete Turner and Arnold Newman to create cover images. Taylor's successful Impulse! albums regularly blurred the genre-based lines between jazz and popular music, and his superb production values became the hallmark of the label.  The Verve years  Although he signed John Coltrane for Impulse in 1960, Taylor left the following year to accept a job with Verve Records. There he prominently introduced bossa nova to the US through recordings such as “The Girl from Ipanema” with Antonio Carlos Jobim and Stan Getz. Jobim, a prolific writer on both piano and guitar, had come up with numerous melodies based on the rhythm of the bossa nova. One such piece, \\"Desafinado\\", found its way into the repertoire of bebop trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie (who intuitively recognized the connection to his genre) and caught the ear of jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd while he was on tour in Brazil. When Byrd returned to the States in 1961 armed with \\"Desafinado\\" and a cache of new Brazilian songs, the first person he rang up was jazz producer Creed Taylor. As Taylor recalls, \\"I went down to Brazil a few times and spent some time at Jobim’s house and met all the players down there. Then of course after “Desafinado” became a hit, Jobim wanted to come up and see what New York was like, so he came in to see me right off the bat. That started a long friendship and series of albums\\". As Gene Lees puts it, \\"Creed Taylor was treating [bossa nova] with respect and dignity. Were it not for Creed Taylor, I am convinced, bossa nova and Brazilian music generally would have retreated in to itself, gone back to Brazil... and become a quaint parochial phenomenon interesting to tourists, instead of the worldwide music and the tremendous influence on jazz itself that it in fact became\\".CTI Website While at Verve, Taylor also produced recordings by Wes Montgomery, Jimmy Smith, Bill Evans, and Cal Tjader, among others. The A&M; Years Taylor began working at A&M; Records in 1967 and formed his own label, CTI (Creed Taylor Inc.), in that same year. A&M; distributed CTI releases until 1969, when Taylor left A&M; to establish CTI as an independent record company. Wes Montgomery joined Taylor at A&M;, where he recorded his final three albums. The CTI years Taylor soon established CTI among the most successful jazz record companies of the 1970s, gaining notice for his ability to balance the artistic with the commercial. Musicians including Freddie Hubbard, Stanley Turrentine, George Benson, Chet Baker, Gerry Mulligan, Nina Simone, Paul Desmond, Art Farmer, Eumir Deodato, Hubert Laws, Herbie Hancock, and Ron Carter are among the artists who recorded for CTI during the 1970s. Taylor also formed other labels within CTI, including the Kudu label, which focused on soul-jazz recordings by Hank Crawford, Grover Washington Jr., Johnny Hammond, Idris Muhammad, Esther Phillips, and othersCreed Taylor Article Bert Gambini, a radio programmer in Buffalo, summarizes, \\"In evaluating CTI, I'm going to borrow the wisdom of Witold Rybczynski, the architectural historian. He felt there was no such thing as a timeless building. Certain structures were admired because they are specifically of their time. I think this too is the case with CTI jazz. This music screams of its era and that's the reason why it's so enjoyable. It's that temporal stamp that I interpret as an asset, not as a liability. Instead of Creed Taylor, think Glenn Miller for a moment. If you want to aurally represent an era like the early 1940s Swing era, is there any better representation than 'In The Mood' or 'String Of Pearls'? The same thing applies to Creed Taylor's CTI brand of jazz from 1970 to 1980\\".CTI Website In 1974, Taylor faced financial problems caused by setting up his own network to distribute CTI labels and made a new distribution deal with Motown. This, however, ended in litigation in 1977 with Taylor having to lose Grover Washington Jr. and the artist's Kudu recordings as part of the settlement to quit Motown. He also lost the rights to Bob James's solo recordings for CTI in a separate litigation. CTI went into Chapter XI bankruptcy in late 1978 before Taylor reached a distribution deal with Columbia Records the following year, in return for the rights to the remaining master recordings. Columbia oversaw various reissue programs of CTI's catalog material, including on CD for the first time. Taylor attempted to buy back the rights to the master tapes in 1989, but the recordings remain with Columbia/Sony BMG with sporadic re-releases coordinated by Didier Deutsch and Arnaldo DeSouteiro. Taylor returned to record production in 1990 with new album releases on CTI, initially distributed through Polygram, and later by Mesa/Bluemoon. Among the artists he signed for CTI in the 90s were Larry Coryell, Jim Beard, Charles Fambrough, Ted Rosenthal, Jim Hall, Bill O'Connell, and Jurgen Friderich. In 2009, Taylor toured Europe with the CTI All Stars band. The first concert at the Montreux Jazz Festival was recorded and filmed for a CD/DVD/Blu-ray release, \\"CTI All Stars At Montreux 2009,\\" featuring Hubert Laws, Airto, Flora Purim, Randy Brecker, John McLaughlin, George Duke, Mark Egan and special guest Jamie Cullum. The album was engineered by Rudy Van Gelder with cover art by Pete Turner. That same year, Taylor himself produced, for the first time, an extensive CTI reissue series on SHM-CD format, \\"The CTI + RVG\\" series, working for the last time with Van Gelder. In 2010, Taylor once again put together the CTI All Stars for another tour, this time with Bryan Lynch replacing Randy Brecker. A video was filmed at the Burghausen Festival and broadcast on German TV. Awards Taylor has won numerous Grammy Awards for his decades of production work. These include awards for: Focus (Stan Getz, 1961), “Desafinado” (Stan Getz/Charlie Byrd, 1962), Conversations with Myself (Bill Evans, 1963), “The Girl from Ipanema” (Stan Getz/Joao Gilberto, 1964), “Willow Weep for Me” (Wes Montgomery, 1969), and “First Light” (Freddie Hubbard, 1972).CTI Website ReferencesExternal links * A Few Words About a Living Legend, Creed Taylor * Biographical profile at dougpayne.com * 4-part JazzWax interview with Creed Taylor 1929 births Living people People from Bedford, Virginia Record producers from Virginia Jazz record producers ","title":"Creed Taylor"},{"id":"1335758","title":"Car Nicobar"},{"id":"1335759","text":"Bohemond or Bohemund, rarely Boamund, can refer to: *Bohemond I of Antioch (1058-1111) *Bohemond II of Antioch (1108-1130) *Bohemond III of Antioch (1144-1201) *Bohemond IV of Antioch & I of Tripoli (1172-1233) *Bohemond V of Antioch & II of Tripoli (1199-1252) *Bohemond VI of Antioch & III of Tripoli (1237-1275) *Bohemond VII of Antioch & IV of Tripoli (1261-1287) *Bohemond I of Manoppello (died 1156) *Bohemond II of Manoppello (died 1169) *Bohemond I, Archbishop of Trier (died 1299) *Bohemond II, Archbishop of Trier (died 1367) *Bohemond, Duke of Apulia (born 1182) *Bohemond of Astarac (died after 1176) ","title":"Bohemond"},{"id":"1335771","text":"LeDroit Park ( or )Left for LeDroit – How do you pronounce ‘LeDroit’? is a neighborhood in Washington, D.C. located immediately southeast of Howard University. Its borders include W Street to the north, Rhode Island Avenue and Florida Avenue to the south, Second Street NW to the east, and Howard University to the west.National Park Service, http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/dc65.htm LeDroit Park is known for its history and 19th century protected architecture. The community's diversity entices new residents to the community, as well as its close proximity to the Shaw–Howard University Metro station and many dining options. 1880 map of LeDroit Park History The neighborhood was founded in 1873 by Amzi Barber, a businessman who served on the board of trustees of neighboring Howard University. Barber named the neighborhood after his father-in-law, LeDroict Langdon, but dropped the ⟨c⟩. As one of the first suburbs of Washington, LeDroit Park was developed and marketed as a \\"romantic\\" neighborhood with narrow tree-lined streets that bore the same names as the trees that shaded them, differing from the street names used in the rest of the city. Extensive focus was placed on the landscaping of this neighborhood, as developers spent a large sum of money to plant flower beds and trees to attract high-profile professionals from the city. Originally a whites-only neighborhood, LeDroit Park was even gated with guards to promote security for its residents. Efforts by many, especially multiple actions by students from Howard University, led to the integration of the area. Between 1886 and 1891, what newspapers called a \\"fence war\\" between LeDroit Park residents and \\"intruders\\" seeking a corridor from Howard Town to downtown unfolded. \\"With the opening of the streets, the park soon lost its former characteristics and became a part of the city with all its advantages and disadvantages.\\" By the 1940s, LeDroit Park became a major focal point for the African-American elite as many prominent figures resided there. Griffith Stadium, the home of the Washington Redskins and Washington Senators was also located here until 1965, when the Howard University Hospital was built where it used to stand. Le Droit Park includes Anna J. Cooper Circle, named for the education pioneer. Historic District Today, the neighborhood's historic value is officially recognized as the LeDroit Park Historic District.Note: A National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination document should be available upon request from the National Park Service for this site, but it appears not to be available on- line from the NPS Focus search site. The historic district includes the Mary Church Terrell House, a U.S. National Historic Landmark. The neighborhood was awarded a place on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Heritage Trail On October 17, 2015, the LeDroit Park Heritage Trail was opened by Cultural Tourism DC. Featuring 16 signs, the 90-minute walking tour chronicles the history of the neighborhood and its residents. The Trail begins where Florida Avenue, 6th and T Streets, NW meet at the \\"gateway\\" to LeDroit Park.  Architecture  One of LeDroit Park's more recognizable features is its Victorian mansions, houses and row-houses, designed by architect James McGill. None of the original 64 homes McGill designed in LeDroit Park were identical and most were built between 1873 and 1877. Today, 50 of the original homes remain. McGill was also a member of the LeDroit Park Property Owners Association, a precursor to the LeDroit Park Civic Association, which is active today. LeDroit's protected housing stock includes 12 different styles of homes. Public spaces and art When the Gage-Eckington School Elementary School closed, residents successfully lobbied the city to tear it down and convert it into a park, which opened in 2011 as The Park at LeDroit. The park houses a large playground, a dog park and the Common Good City Farm, an urban agriculture education center and community garden with 40 plots. In May 2011, His Royal Highness Prince Charles of Wales visited the Common Good City Farm. This Is How We Live by Garin BakerMurals are painted on many walls throughout the neighborhood. This Is How We Live was commissioned by the DC Commission on the Arts & Humanities to be painted by artist Garin Baker.http://incorrigiblecurmudgeon.blogspot.com/2009/07/i-lovethis-mural.html The mural shows the African-American heritage of the neighborhood, the changing community and landscape and historical and architectural scenes from the past and present. At the dedication on December 13, 2008, Mayor Adrian M. Fenty is quoted as describing the mural as serving to > ... visually engage residents through a beautiful neighborhood mural that > depicts the unique landscapes, people and images of the historic LeDroit > Park community.

Review of Ain't Nobody's Business if You Do: The Absurdity of Consensual Crimes in Our Free Country by Peter McWilliams. Foundation for Economic Education, January 1, 1995.Review of Ain't Nobody's Business if You Do: The Absurdity of Consensual Crimes in Our Free Country by Peter McWilliams. Publishers Weekly, October 30, 2000. The book is divided into five sections. *Part I gives a definition of victimless and consensual crime and outlines the difference between personal morality and governmentally-imposed morality. *Part II presents arguments against the criminalization of victimless crimes. *Part III gives a closer look into some of the individual activities which the author classifies as consensual crimes, such as prostitution and marijuana use, but which the majority of criminologists would classify as victimless. *Part IV gives historical examples of the treatment of consensual and victimless crimes, such as Prohibition, and Biblical examples. *Part V advises readers on what to do to change the laws. Throughout the book are approximately six hundred quotations by noted thinkers on both sides of his positions (primarily supporters). McWilliams presents a variety of arguments against the criminalization of victimless crimes. Some are philosophical in nature: one argument is that laws against these crimes are based in religion, which violates the separation of church and state. He also claims that they are un-American, as they attempt to homogenize the country to a certain group's idea of morality, and that they create an oppressive society, restricting personal freedoms without justification. Another claim is that they teach irresponsibility, by not letting people deal with the natural consequences of their actions, but rather penalizing them whether or not their actions harmed anyone else. Other objections are practical: catching the \\"criminals\\" involved is an expensive affair. Victimless crimes draw manpower and funds away from crimes that do hurt innocent parties, and enforcement of the laws is not consistent enough to be an effective deterrent. He also argues that actions to help people deal with problems caused by these illegal activities are effectively prevented by their criminalization—for example, no one could be helped about their drinking problems during Prohibition. Additionally, he details how laws against victimless crimes paved the way for organized crime. Activities examined in detail in Part III include gambling, recreational drug use, medical marijuana, prostitution, homosexuality, pornography, indecent exposure, and seat belt legislation. Until a few years after McWilliams's death, the text of this book (as well as McWilliams' other books) was available for free in its entirety through his archived web site; though all the books have been removed from that site in favor of links to online retail vendors, the texts have been archived in various formats by others.

He oversaw Bing Crosby's rise to success as a recording artist in the early 1930s, and, four decades later, Crosby still gave appreciation to Kapp for diversifying his song catalogue into various styles and genres, saying, \\"I thought he was crazy, but I just did what he told me.\\" Kapp could not read or sing music, but to his talent he stressed the credo, \\"Where's the melody?\\" Biography Born to a Jewish family, the son of a distributor for Columbia Records in 1905 and the founder of the Imperial Talking Machine Shop in Chicago. Kapp worked at the store after high school, and was known for having memorized the catalog numbers of every record in the inventory as well as the addresses and phone numbers of his father's best customers. After marrying his childhood sweetheart Frieda Lutz in 1922, he opened the Kapp Record Store with his younger brother, Dave Kapp. In 1926, Kapp joined Brunswick Records and was put in charge of their \\"race\\" label (Brunswick 7000 and Vocalion Records 1000 series), where he scouted, signed or produced artists including, King Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Pinetop Smith, Leroy Carr, Frankie Jaxon, and Cow Cow Davenport, among others. Kapp also worked with artists on the Brunswick label; it was over the company's objection that he had Al Jolson record \\"Sonny Boy\\"; the song became a huge success for Jolson. The artists signed by Kapp included Crosby, Cab Calloway, the Mills Brothers, the Boswell Sisters, and Mildred Bailey. Kapp sold Brunswick's British franchises to stockbroker Edward R. Lewis, who owned the English Decca Company. Two years later, when a deal to buy Columbia Records fell through, the pair instead started Decca Records. Crosby's deal with Brunswick had an escape clause that allowed him to follow Kapp to the new company. Other artists followed, including the Mills Brothers, Boswell Sisters, Earl Hines, Ted Lewis, Isham Jones and the Dorsey Brothers. Kapp also signed new performers such as Chick Webb, Art Tatum, Jimmie Lunceford, Ethel Waters, and a year after the company's founding, Louis Armstrong. Dave Kapp was instrumental in building the company's extensive hillbilly catalogue, allowing Decca to corner the market on country music for years. Record sales had plunged during the Depression, and Kapp decided that Decca discs would sell for 50 cents instead of the usual 75 cents to a dollar. When Brunswick shifted its back catalogue to a 25-cent subsidiary label in an effort to sink the fledgling company, Kapp further reduced the price to 35 cents per disc. Crucially, he also pursued the then-new jukebox market. In 1938, Decca began releasing record sleeves with cover artwork; other innovations such as liner notes and Broadway cast albums followed (although Jack Kapp pioneered this practice in 1933 by recording the entire \\"Blackbirds of 1928\\" and \\"Showboat\\" scores and issuing them in album sets). By 1939, the company was on its feet; 18 million of the 50 million records sold in the United States that year were issued by Decca. After Kapp's death, his brother Dave took over American Decca. Dave Kapp later founded Kapp Records, based in New York.

Origin Various stories recount how the salad was invented. One says that it came about in 1937 at the Hollywood Brown Derby restaurant, where it became a signature dish. It is named after the restaurant's owner, Robert Howard Cobb. Stories vary whether the salad was invented by Cobb or by his chef, Paul J. Posti. The legend is that Cobb had not eaten until near midnight, and so he mixed together leftovers he found in the kitchen, along with some bacon cooked by the line cook, and tossed it with their French dressing. Another version of the creation is that Robert Kreis, executive chef at the restaurant, created the salad in 1929 (the year the Brown Derby's Hollywood location opened) and named it in honor of Robert Cobb. The same source confirms that 1937 was the reported date of the version noted above, with Cobb making the salad. Authentic versions of the Cobb salad are prepared using four varieties of greens: iceberg lettuce, watercress, endive and romaine lettuce. Some recipes include other types of cheese besides Roquefort, such as cheddar or Monterey Jack, or no cheese at all.

This allows medicines to be delivered to and absorbed in the lungs, which provides the ability for targeted medical treatment to this specific region of the body, as well as a reduction in the side effects of oral medications. There are a wide variety of inhalers, and they are commonly used to treat numerous medical conditions with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) being among the most notable. Some of the common types of inhalers include meter-dosed inhalers, dry powder inhalers, soft mist inhalers, and nebulizers. Each device has advantages and disadvantages and can be selected based on specific patient needs, as well as age, coordination, and lung function. Proper education on inhaler use is important to ensure that inhaled medication takes its proper effects in the lungs. Medical Uses Inhalers are designed to deliver medication directly to the lungs through a person's own breathing. This may benefit a patient by providing medicines directly to areas of disease, allowing medication to take a greater effect on its intended target, and limit side effects of medications due to localized treatment. Inhalers are used in a variety of different medical conditions with diseases of the lungs and respiratory system being among the most common. These conditions utilize medications designed to decrease airway inflammation and obstruction to allow for easier and less strained breathing. Antibiotic medications have even been developed for inhalers to allow for direct delivery to areas of infection within the lungs. Two of the most common conditions that warrant inhaler therapy are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Asthma Asthma is a condition of intermittent airway obstruction due to inflammatory processes in the lungs. Inhaled medications are used to calm down the inflammation present in the lungs and allow for relief of the airway obstruction. Common inhaled medications used for treatment of asthma are salbutamol, corticosteroids, and salmeterol. These medications allow for patients to have relief of airway obstruction symptoms and reduced inflammation. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) COPD is an obstructive lung disease due to long-term damage to the airways of the lung. The long-term damage leads to the inability of the airways to open properly, causing airway obstruction. Inhaled medications allow for patient's to see improvement in symptoms and better function of daily living. Some commonly used inhaled medications in patient's with COPD are ipratroprium, salmeterol, and corticosteroids. Types Meter-dosed Inhalers (MDI) The most common type of inhaler is the pressurized metered-dose inhaler (MDI) which is made up of 3 standard components- a metal canister, plastic actuator, and a metering valve. The medication is typically stored in solution in a pressurized canister that contains a propellant or suspension. The MDI canister is attached to a plastic, hand-operated actuator. On activation, the metered-dose inhaler releases a fixed dose of medication in aerosol form through the actuator and into a patient's lungs. These devices require significant coordination as a person must discharge the medication at or near the same time that they inhale in order for the medication to be effective. Different types of dry powder inhalers Dry Powder Inhalers (DPI) Dry powder inhalers release a metered or device-measured dose of powdered medication that is inhaled through a DPI device. This device usually contains a chamber in which the powdered medication is deposited prior to each dosage. The powder can then be inhaled with a quick breath. This allows for medication to be delivered to the lungs without the need for use of propellant/suspension. Soft Mist Inhalers (SMI) Nebulizer with face mask Soft mist inhalers release a light mist containing medication without the need for a propellant/suspension. Upon pressing a button, the inhaler creates a mist of medication, allowing for inhalation into the lungs. SMIs suspend inhaled medications for roughly 1.2 seconds, which is longer than the average MDI inhaler suspension time period. This requires less coordination when using and may be helpful for young patients or patients that find the MDI inhalers difficult to use. Nebulizers Nebulizers are designed to deliver medications over an extended period of time over multiple breaths through a mouthpiece or face mask. They generate a continuous mist with aerosolized medication, allowing a patient to breath normally and receive medications. They are commonly used in infants and toddlers requiring inhaled medications or in patients in the hospital who require inhaled medications. Propellants In 2009, the FDA banned the use of inhalers that use chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) as propellants. In their place, inhalers now use hydrofluoroalkane (HFA). HFA is not environmentally inert as it is a greenhouse gas but it does not affect the ozone layer. While some asthma sufferers and advocacy groups contend that HFA inhalers are not as effective, published clinical studies indicate CFC and HFA inhalers are equally effective in controlling asthma. While the impact of CFCs from inhalers on the ozone layer had been minuscule (dwarfed by industrial processes using CFCs,) the FDA in its interpretation of the Montreal Protocol mandated the switch in propellants. Patients expressed concern about the high price of the HFA inhalers as there are no generic versions, whereas generic CFC inhalers had been available. Proper Use It is important to use proper technique when administering inhalers to self or others. Improper use of inhalers is very common and can lead to distribution of the medicine into the mouth or throat where it cannot take its desired effect. Education on the correct use of inhalers for delivery of medications is a commonly cited topic in medical studies and a great deal of thought has been put into how best to help people learn to use their inhalers effectively. Below is a description of proper inhaler technique for each different type of inhaler as well as a helpful video explaining what the text states. Using an inhaler Meter-dosed Inhalers: 1\\\\. Remove mouthpiece and shake inhaler for 5–10 seconds 2\\\\. Grip inhaler with mouthpiece on the bottom and canister on top. A finger should be placed on the canister to allow for delivery of medicine. 3\\\\. Breathe out completely and place mouth over mouthpiece. 4\\\\. As you begin to breathe in, press down on the canister (this releases the medicine). 5\\\\. Continue to breathe in slowly and deeply and hold your breath for 5–10 seconds (this keeps the medicine in your lungs where it is supposed to be). 6\\\\. Breathe out. If you are supposed to take multiple puffs of medicine, wait 15–30 seconds and repeat steps 1-5. 7\\\\. Replace mouthpiece With Spacer: Place spacer at the mouthpiece of your meter- dosed inhaler and your mouth at the end of the spacer. Press down on the canister and breathe in deeply when ready for delivery of the medicine to the lungs. This decreases need for coordination of breathing with inhaler activation. Dry Powder Inhalers: 1\\\\. Prepare inhaler medication chamber (this will be different based on the type of inhaler but will involve preparing and opening the chamber with the medication) 2\\\\. Hold the inhaler with the chamber pointing towards you and breathe out completely with her head turned away from the inhaler 3\\\\. Place mouth over the chamber and take a quick, deep breath to allow medication to dispense in the lungs 4\\\\. Hold breath for 5–10 seconds and then exhale slowly 5\\\\. Repeat steps 1-4 if another dose is needed Soft Mist Inhalers: 1\\\\. Prime inhaler (this involves loading the cartridge and discharging the inhaler until a fine mist is visible - more explanation in the video) 2\\\\. Breathe out completely and place mouth around the mouthpiece while leaving space for the small holes on the side of the mouthpiece 3\\\\. Breathe in slowly while at the same time pressing the button to release the medication 4\\\\. Hold breath for 5–10 seconds 5\\\\. Breathe out slowly and repeat steps 1-4 if another dose of medication is required If inhaler is used everyday, you should only have to prime the inhaler the first time using a new cartridge, but it may need to be primed again if it has not been used in multiple days. After use: If using inhaled corticosteroids, rinse mouth out directly after use of inhaler. This helps to prevent infection. Nebulizer: 1\\\\. Place mouth over mouthpiece or face mask over nose and mouth 2\\\\. Turn on nebulizer machine 3\\\\. Breath normally for 10-20 min (or time allotted for treatment) 4\\\\. Turn off machine and remove face mask/mouthpiece History Penetro brand inhaler from mid 20th century Mexico, part of the permanent collection of the Museo del Objeto del Objeto Inhaler designed by John Mudge in 1778 The idea of directly delivering medication into the lungs was based on ancient traditional cures that involved the use of aromatic and medicinal vapours. These did not involve any special devices beyond the apparatus used for burning or heating to produce fumes. Early inhalation devices included one devised by John Mudge in 1778. It had a pewter mug with a hole allowing attachment of a flexible tube. Mudge used it for the treatment of coughs using opium. These devices evolved with modifications by Wolfe, Mackenzie (1872) and better mouth attachments such as by Beigel in 1866. Many of these early inhalers needed heat to vapourize the active chemical ingredient. The benefits of forced expiration and inspiration to treat asthma were noted by J. S. Monell in 1865. Chemicals used in inhalers included ammonia, chlorine, iodine, tar, balsams, turpentine camphor and numerous others in combinations. Julius Mount Bleyer used a variation in 1890 in New York. Mouthpiece for an inhaler designed by Dr Beigel (1867) In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories developed the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler that allowed the self-administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia. The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5 inches long and 1 inch in diameter with a 1 inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled wick of polypropylene felt which held 15 milliliters of methoxyflurane. Because of the simplicity of the Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary over a period of time lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15 milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary. The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox inhaler.

After the Romans were defeated by Pyrrhus at Heraclea, Fabricius negotiated peace terms with Pyrrhus and perhaps the ransom and exchange of prisoners; Plutarch reports that Pyrrhus was impressed by his inability to bribe Fabricius, and released the prisoners even without a ransom.Plutarch Pyrrhus 18 Fabricius was consul a second time in 278 BC, and once again successful against the Samnites, Lucanians and Bruttians. He also defeated Tarentum's army after Pyrrhus' departure from Italy to Sicily. Fabricius was elected censor in 275 BC. The tales of Fabricius are the standard ones of austerity and incorruptibility, similar to those told of Curius Dentatus, and Cicero often cites them together; it is difficult to make out a true personality behind the virtues. On the other hand, Valerius Maximus says that he and his co-consul/co-censor Quintus Aemilius Papus kept \\"silver in the[ir] homes... Each of them had a dish for the gods and a salt cellar, but Fabricius was more elegant because he chose to put a little pedestal of horn under his dish.\\" [Valerius Maximus, Chapter Four \\"Poverty\\" 4.3] In the Purgatorio of Dante's Divine Comedy, Canto XX depicted Fabricius as an example of virtue opposing Avarice, as the Pilgrim and Virgil trek through the realm of Purgatory, also galvanizing the connection between poverty and asceticism. They say his principles were so deeply embedded within his character that he suffered intense impoverishment, and that he died a pauper and had to be buried by the state.

Sean Patrick Adams, Claudius Crozet (1789-1864) available at https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Crozet_Claudius_1789-1864 Crozet was born in France and trained as an artillery officer and civil engineer. After the defeat of Napoleon's army, he emigrated to the United States in 1816 and joined the U.S. Army to teach at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.Appleton's Cyclopedia, Vol. II p. 22 After resigning his commission in 1823, he took a job with the Virginia Board of Public Works and oversaw the planning and construction of canals, turnpikes, bridges and railroads in Virginia, including the area which became West Virginia during the American Civil War (during which Crozet sided with the Confederate States of America). Crozet also helped found the Virginia Military Institute in 1839 and earned a nickname as the \\"Pathfinder of the Blue Ridge.\\" Early life, family Claudius Crozet was born in Villefranche, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, France on December 31, 1789 to Pierrette Varion Crozet and her husband, wine merchant François Crozet. His mother died when he was a boy, and his father moved to Paris in 1800 with Claude and two siblings. Claude secured permission to attend the École Polytechnique in 1805. He studied engineering (including bridge-building) as well as military matters, and graduated as sub-lieutenant on October 1, 1807. Crozet then graduated from the Imperial Artillery School in Metz, and received a commission as a second lieutenant on June 9, 1809. Thus, he served in the French Army under Napoleon Bonaparte, and won a promotion to captain on July 22, 1812 during Napoleon's invasion of Russia. At the Battle of Borodino in September 1812, Captain Crozet was taken prisoner, but released in 1814 and returned to duty in the French army.https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Crozet_Claudius_1789-1864 Napoleon abdicated in April 1814, but returned to power about a year later, was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815 and surrendered about a month later. Crozet resigned from the French military on April 11, 1816. On June 7, 1816, in Paris, Crozet married Agathe Decamp, and they would have daughters Agatha and Claudia Crozet Mills and a son (Alfred) before her death in March 1861.https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Crozet_Claudius_1789-1864https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Crozet_Claudius_1789-1864findagrave no. 156695284 Immigration to United States Late in fall of 1816, Crozet and his bride headed for the United States.Couper, William (1936), Claudius Crozet: Soldier-Scholar-Educator-Engineer (1789-1864); Charlottesville: Historical Publishing Co. as cited in Hunter (1961) Almost immediately after arriving, Crozet began work as a professor of engineering at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York.Angulo, A. J. (2012). The polytechnic comes to America: How French approaches to science instruction influenced mid-nineteenth century American higher education. History of Science, 50(168), 315. While at West Point, Crozet is credited by some as being the first to use the chalkboard as an instructional tool. He used the \\"Elementary Course of Civil Engineering\\", translated from the course of M. J. Sganzin at the École Polytechnique. He also designed several of the buildings at West Point. Thomas Jefferson referred to Claudius Crozet as \\"by far the best mathematician in the United States.\\" He also published A Treatise on Descriptive Geometry while at West Point. Life in Virginia=Virginia Board of Public Works In 1823, Crozet was elected Principal Engineer and Surveyor for the Virginia Board of Public Works.Hunter,(1963) He resigned from his duties at West Point, and brought his wife and two children (a boy and a girl) with him to live in Richmond, Virginia. Virginia's Board of Public Works was very active in promoting the development of canals, roads, and railroads. His work included approving various proposals and determining their engineering feasibility. At the time, Virginia extended all the way from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ohio River and was the largest state east of the Mississippi River. It included what is now the State of West Virginia. Crozet worked on hundreds of transportation projects, such as the Northwestern Turnpike. Typical of his many projects of this nature was the Chesterfield Railroad, the first in Virginia, the plans of which he examined before Board of Public Works funds were approved. It began operations in 1831. In 1832, Crozet left Virginia to work in Louisiana. However, he returned to his old job in Virginia in 1837 to work on roads, canals, railroads and other points of necessity for the state. By this time, some railroads were already under construction and the canal system had reached its potential. He left office in 1843 after losing support of canal owners when he correctly forecast the future advantages railroads would hold for Virginia. Authoring textbooks on highway, railroad and aqueduct design, his 1848 map of the entire state was the first since the one prepared by Peter Jefferson, father of Thomas Jefferson, over a century earlier. Virginia Military Institute The North Entrance to the Blue Ridge tunnel Crozet was one of the founders of Virginia Military Institute (VMI) at Lexington, Virginia, a major training institution for engineers and militia officers for Virginia and the South. When VMI opened in 1839, Crozet was the architect of the college's academic program and military organization. At its first meeting, the members of the VMI Board of Visitors elected Crozet president of the Board, a position he held for six years (while remaining the state's Chief Engineer). However, his varied duties meant Crozet did not reside in Lexington, Virginia. In 1840, he and his family and five enslaved people lived in Richmond, Virginia.U.S. Federal Census for Richmond Ward 3, Henrico County, Virginia Ten years later, he and at least two much younger engineers boarded with plantation owner John T. Cocke in Albemarle County, Virginia.U.S. Federal Census for Albemarle County, Virginia, family 1250 Blue Ridge Tunnels In 1839, Crozet surveyed the Blue Ridge Mountains and determined that the best way to allow the Blue Ridge Railroad, an extension of the Virginia Central Railroad, to cross the mountain would be through a series of four tunnels (from east to west: Greenwood Tunnel, Brookville Tunnel, Little Rock Tunnel, and Blue Ridge Tunnel) near Rockfish Gap at Afton Mountain. The long Blue Ridge Tunnel was opened in 1856, although rail service did not begin until April 1858. At that time, it was the longest tunnel in the United States and one of the longest in the world. Dug a decade before the invention of dynamite it was considered to be an \\"engineering wonder of the world\\" and was less than a half-foot (15.2 centimetres) off perfect alignment, as construction had proceeded from either end. Upon completion of the tunnels in 1858, the Blue Ridge Railroad ceased to exist, becoming a part of the Virginia Central Railroad. During the American Civil War, Confederate General Thomas Stonewall Jackson, a former instructor at VMI, used Crozet's tunnel to transfer his \\"foot cavalry\\" (comparable to a rapid deployment force today) from the Shenandoah Valley to the east side of the Blue Ridge quickly, to the puzzlement and consternation of Union military leaders. In 1868, the Virginia Central Railroad was merged with the Covington and Ohio Railroad to create the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway; the original tunnel served until it was replaced with a different alignment in 1944. Perhaps as mute testament to Crozet's extraordinary skills, despite advances in technology from the 1850s, the \\"new\\" mid 20th century tunnel was off- center, in comparison with only 6 inches in Crozet's earlier project. Death and legacy Crozet's grave on the campus of the Virginia Military Institute, in Lexington, Virginia Crozet died in January 1864 at the residence of his daughter and son-in-law, as the Confederacy was losing the Civil War, but more than a year before its defeat. He was initially buried near his wife and children in Shockhoe Hill Cemetery, but in 1942 his remains were reinterred in the Virginia Military Institute cemetery.https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Crozet_Claudius_1789-1864findagrave Hundreds of plans and drawings which he oversaw have been retained in the archives of the Library of Virginia. The town of Crozet, Virginia was named in his honor in 1870. The original Blue Ridge Tunnel is now proposed for a \\"rails-to-trails\\" project sponsored by Nelson County. When completed, it will be the third-longest pedestrian tunnel in the nation. VMI also named its dining hall in his honor, so cadets sometimes affectionately call it \\"Club Crozet\\".

It is located at the mouth of the Saugeen River. The size of the town is 6.44 square kilometres. The permanent population in 2016 was 3,678 but the summer population is higher, due to cottagers and campers spending vacation time in the area. Although the community still has its own post office, and road signs indicating the name Southampton, it is no longer an entity, per se. In 1998, Port Elgin, Southampton and Township of Saugeen, all along the shores of Lake Huron, were amalgamated to form the Town of Port Elgin-Saugeen-Southampton. On December 17, 1998, the Province renamed the community the Town of Saugeen Shores. The primary employment categories are agriculture, small business, tourism and the Bruce Power nuclear power station which is 40 kilometres away. Southampton is a bedroom community, a retirement destination, as well as a tourist destination. History The Walker House, a historic hotel in the village since the 1860s. Long before settlers arrived to the area, Southampton was an important trading area, according to a historic plaque erected in town by the Government of Ontario, titled Fur Trading at Saugeen: The community was originally known as Saugeen by the early residents, by the Canadian Post Office and by Custom House Departments. However, the Crown Land Departments labelled the village as Southampton and the name stuck as the town was incorporated, named after Southampton, the English sea port. The first European settlers of the area, around 1848, were Captain John Spence and William Kennedy, who wanted to establish a fishing company. While it proved unfruitful, Spence became a sailor and Kennedy joined a search for the Arctic explorer, Sir John Franklin. Nevertheless, in 1851 there were at least a dozen families living in the community.Robertson, 509. In the same year, the Post Office was established, the first and only in Bruce County for several years. Three years later, a Bank of Upper Canada was built. In 1846, Smith's Canadian Gazetteer describes Saugeen (Southampton) as little more than a pioneer settlement: The pioneers of Southampton wanted the village to become the county town or county seat, as the village held the only Crown Land Department and Post Office in the county. However, the town of Kincardine had a larger population and seemed the strongest rival. Furthermore, Southampton did not have enough population to meet the requirements for incorporation. The town petitioned the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and the elective officials passed an exceptional Act of Incorporation on July 24, 1858 to allow the community to be considered for the county seat. Despite their efforts, Walkerton eventually won the battle. Chantry Island lighthouse and keeper's cottage, from the licensed tour boat In the mid-1800s, John Denny built a dam, a grist mill, a sawmill, a woolen mill and an inn on the Saugeen River. (Only the latter building remains at 484 Carlisle Street; the current dam was built in the 1970s.) The Chantry Island Lightstation Tower was completed in April 1859, first lit on April 1, with Duncan McGregor Lambert as the first keeper. (The tower and the keeper's home have been extensively renovated and are open for tours, several days a week late May to mid-September, operated only by the Marine Heritage Society. Otherwise, access to the island is prohibited because it is a federal bird sanctuary.) Records from 1869 indicate that the population had increased to 600. Large amount of wheat, pork and lumber were being shipped from the village. A bank agency was operating. Good roads were available to other communities. A steam ship made runs to Goderich and Collingwood in summer; stagecoaches operated in winter. Southampton was incorporated as a town in 1904; at the time, its population was over 2400. The economic base included commercial fishing, warehousing, furniture factories, a tannery and mills. The town built a hospital in 1947, a post office in 1952, a library in 1956, an arena in 1961 (replaced in 1977) and a new firehall in 1974. In the early 2000s, a historically significant shipwreck was discovered on the beach. Relics of the ship, \\"General Hunter,\\" can be found in the Bruce County Museum. 33 Victoria Street, the Old Public School, now part of the Bruce County Museum and Cultural Centre.  Historical timeline, 1848 to 1904  Although specific dates vary depending on the source, the following are excerpted from a reliable source, History of the County of Bruce, Ontario, Canada, by Norman Robertson, published in 1906. * 1848: The first settlement by Capt. John Spence and William Kennedy, * 1851: First post-office, known as Saugeen, opens. * 1852: First school opens in the village. * 1853: First manufacturing industry was a steam sawmill. * 1857: Denny's grist mill is already operating; he would add a grist mill in 1857, a sawmill in 1859 and a woolen mill in 1865. * 1857: The village has over 130 houses; the business area is north of High Street, on Huron and Grosvenor Streets. There is a planning mill, a steam sawmill, and a saw and grist mill. There is no large pier but each warehouse has a landing wharf. A large pier would be built in the 1860s, called the Bogus Dock. * 1858: An Act of incorporation is passed July 24 making Saugeen a village. * 1859: The Chantry Island Lightstation Tower is first illuminated on 1 April. * 1880: A large tannery is opened by Bowman & Zinkan. * 1885: Commercial fishing has grown, now employing 70 men, manning 18 boats. Steam boats are starting to become common. * 1886: A fire in November destroys over fifty buildings. 1889 or 1890: Post office is renamed Southampton. * 1895: As a port of entry, Saugeen is changed to Southampton. The Knechtel family begins opening large furniture factories. * 1897: Saugeen Electric Light and Power Company begins providing electricity from Denny's dam. * 1889: First bridge (430 feet long) at the mouth of the Saugeen River is completed. * 1903: A smaller lighthouse, with front and back \\"range\\" lights and foghorn, opens at the harbour at the mouth of the river. * 1904: Southampton is incorporated a town on December 26; the population is over 2400. Alexander Emerson Belcher is the first mayor. ClimateEconomy Tourism drives the economy but the Bruce Nuclear plant in nearby Tiverton, Ontario is major employer. In 2016, the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station started a $13 billion refurbishment program in 2016 which will provide employment for many residents and maintain demand for other services. According to Bruce Power, this multi-year plan \\"will generate between 1,500 and 2,500 jobs on site annually – and 18,000 across Ontario directly and indirectly – while injecting up to $4 billion annually into Ontario’s economy\\". Tourism Beach at Southampton, Ontario This area of the Lake Huron shore is known for its long sand beaches (the Main Beach is approximately 4 km long) as well as the sunsets since the beach area faces to the west.https://visitsouthampton.ca/explore/southamptons-beaches/167/, Explorehttps://visitsouthampton.ca/profile/southampton-sunset-viewing-sunset- photography/853/, Southampton Sunset Viewing & Sunset Photographyhttps://visitsouthampton.ca/profile/southampton-main-beach/801/, Main Beach Every Friday night in from mid June to early September, a bagpiper plays under the \\"Big Flag\\" at the foot of High Street on Friday evenings, a tradition which started in the late 1990s. Canada Day is a highly celebrated occasion, where hundreds of cottagers and locals alike gather on Southampton Beach to watch the fireworks lit off the base of the \\"Big Flag\\". During the months of July and August there are \\"Ghost Walks\\" available every Tuesday night with Katherine Leonard & Raymond Harrison. These commence at sunset at the foot of High St at the \\"Big Flag\\". During the summer and early fall, the beaches are full of people who have come to see the colourful sunsets lighting up the sky over the lake. Near the town, Southampton, a summer destination, is close to Chantry Island, Port Elgin, Saugeen First Nation which holds a PowWow in August each year, and Sauble Beach. Every Thursday evening from early June to late August, a Cruise Nite is held; the classic cars park downtown on High St. near the lake shore. Concerts are held at Fairy Lake at least one evening per week in summer. Harbour Range light, one of the first designated under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act Fishing is common in this area in the nearby Saugeen River, at Denny's Dam and in Lake Huron. The Chantry Chinook Classic Salmon Derby is held each summer, usually from about mid July to the second week of August. The contest's weigh stations are located in Saugeen Shores and in two other Lake Huron communities, Kincardine, Ontario, and Wiarton, Ontario. The Bruce County Museum & Cultural Centre provides displays about local history and in summer especially, offers adult and children's programming and special events. These are listed in the Shoreline Beacon community newspaper. The museum has been enlarged over the years and was recently renovated. In addition to a settlers cabin, the facility houses numerous historic artifacts from the area, genealogical records, county newspapers, photographs, and municipal documents. During July and August, seven days a week, the S.S. Trolley shuttles passengers between downtown Port Elgin and Southampton along the roadway for a modest fee. The Chantry Island Lightstation Tower was built in 1859; the tower, keeper's cottage, boat house and dock have been fully restored. The island is a federal Migratory Bird Sanctuary and access is prohibited except with the single licensed tour operator. From late-May to mid-September, tours of the lightstation facilities are available several times a week. They leave on the Marine Heritage Society's boat from the ticket office by the fishing boat docks at the harbour. Three other local lighthouses have been designated under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act: McNab Point and both the Front and Rear Range lights at the River Front.  Cottages  There are numerous cottage owners in and around Southampton. Cottage owners are uniquely split between those who own their land outright and those with cottages located on Native lands.https://www.saugeenlandmgt.com/, Saugeen Land Management A lease relationship exists between the Saugeen First Nation (\\"Chippewas of Saugeen\\")https://saugeenfirstnation.ca/, Saugeen First Nation and cottagers who have built seasonal homes on Native land in the lakeside area between urban Southampton and Sauble Beach; there are approximately 1,200 such cottages.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/let-us-back-into-our- cottages/article658498/, Let us back into our cottageshttps://scoi.ca/member- organizations/, Member Organizations Each cottager on such land pays an annual lease fee to the First Nation for use of the land. The current (mid 2019) lease contract between the cottagers and two Saugeen First Nation Reserves, Chief's Point 28 and Saugeen 29, is in effect until 30 April 2021.https://scoi.ca/about-scoi/, Saugeen Cottager’s Organization Incorporated Saugeen Rail Trail After the railways ceased to service the area, the tracks were removed and the beds were vacant and overgrown. A group of volunteers founded the Saugeen RailTrail Association in 1990, and convinced Port Elgin, Southampton and Saugeen Township to acquire sections of the then unused rail bed. Over the years, the bed has been developed as trails for walking and cycling. The trail connects Southampton and Port Elgin. The trail also connects to the 80 kilometre long Bruce County Trail Network which leads to towns such as Paisley, Walkerton, Mildmay and Kincardine. The trailhead can be accessed at River Street in Port Elgin, a few blocks north of the town centre and east of Hwy 21. There are other access points in both towns, some with parking. The trail is not groomed for cross country skiing during the winter but is used frequently for that purpose. Maps of the trails are available on the web site of the Saugeen Railtrail Association. Health care The Town of Saugeen Shores' hospital is in Southampton, Saugeen Memorial. Many physicians' practices are at the Saugeen Shores Medical Building. The hospital is part of the Grey Bruce Health Services' network of hospitals in northern Bruce and in Grey County. According to the local Health Services department, facilities include 16 beds, a 24-hour emergency department, surgery, acute medical care and outpatient services. Other facilities include: * Chaplaincy Services * Diagnostic Imaging Department including x-ray, ECG, Holter monitoring, ultrasound * Inpatient Medical Care (Acute Care) * Laboratory Services * Physiotherapy * Surgical Services The hospital also houses other community health providers. Day surgery services are offered and include ear, nose and throat surgery. Retirement and assisted living The Town of Saugeen Shores includes senior service groups and clubs as well as aid providers and senior homes that offer full services. Relevant providers include Home and Community Support Services Grey Bruce, two assisted living residences, the Hampton Court Retirement Lodge (Southampton) and Kingsway Arms at Elgin Lodge (Port Elgin) and Southampton Care Centre long term care home. Social and other services for seniors are available at PARC 55+ (Port Elgin) and Chantry Senior Centre (Southampton).

In their heyday, Blue Peter opened for major international acts such as the Police and Simple Minds. The video for \\"Don't Walk Past\\", directed by Rob Quartly, was No. 85 on MuchMusic's top videos of the century list, and was played on MTV in the United States, in spite of the lack of American record distribution for the band. The band continues to perform, on occasion. History Blue Peter was founded by guitarist/songwriter Chris Wardman and lead singer Paul Humphrey in the late 1970s, as a high school band. The initial lineup was rounded out by bassist Geoff McOuat and drummer Ron Tomlinson; this ensemble recorded Blue Peter's first EP, Test Patterns for Living, in 1979. In 1980, Mike Bambrick replaced Tomlinson on drums, and in the same year, the band released their first full- length album, Radio Silence. Over the next couple of years, Blue Peter ran into difficulties with record labels and management, which led to them briefly releasing material on their own label, including \\"Chinese Graffiti\\" in 1981. Around this same time, McOuat left the band and was replaced by new bassist Ric Joudrey. After a year without label representation, Blue Peter returned to Ready Records in 1982, in time to release Up To You. \\"Chinese Graffiti\\" was included on the Up To You release, and won the band a CASBY Award (then known as the \\"U-Knows\\") for Single Of The Year in 1982. When Falling was recorded, the band was fleshed out by the addition of Jason Sniderman on keyboards, and new drummer Owen Tennyson (replacing Bambrick). The album was their most successful, and would also prove to be their last. It spawned their biggest single, \\"Don't Walk Past\\", and its companion video, which won awards including \\"Best Video of 1983\\" from the Canadian Film and Television Association. Falling ranked 24th on CFNY's Top 83 of '83. \\"Don't Walk Past\\", was ranked at number 92 in CFNY's Best 102 of the Decade, published in 1990. After Falling, Blue Peter had some of the tracks, including \\"Don't Walk Past\\", remixed by engineer Kevin Doyle and released these remixes as Version in 1984. That same year, Blue Peter won another CASBY, this time for Male Vocalist of the Year, for Paul Humphrey. Later in 1984, Blue Peter demoed several tracks for a proposed new album (tentatively entitled Vertigo), but the band broke up before the tracks were completed or released. In 1997, the band issued the \\"best-of\\" compilation All Through The Night which featured one newly overdubbed and mixed track from the Vertigo demo sessions called \\"Equalizer\\". In 2006, Blue Peter reunited for a concert to commemorate the release of The Best of Ready :: 20th Century Masters — The Millennium Collection. The following year, the band reissued their catalog as three compilation CDs. The re-release of Falling included 8 of the Vertigo demos as bonus tracks. Since then, the band has played a couple of concerts a year, including appearances at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009 to promote the movie Suck, which featured music by them on its soundtrack. In January 2011, Blue Peter performed at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto as part of Juno Decades: Songs of the '80s. Live Blue Peter performed across Canada from 1979-1985. Some notable opening slots included the Boomtown Rats (Toronto at El Mocambo), the Jam (Toronto at the Concert Hall, and Ottawa), Simple Minds at (Massey Hall in Toronto, and Montreal) and The Police at \\"The Police Picnic '83\\" in Toronto. In 1984 the band played a sold out show at Toronto's Ontario Place Forum.

It is the innermost inlet of the larger Hen and Chicken Bay. Two other bays to the north of Canada Bay are two other bays named for Canadian internment camps for convicts involved in the Lower Canada Rebellion: * Exile Bay - surrounded by Massey Park Golf Club and Prince Edward Park * France Bay - surrounded by residential area of Cabarita, New South Wales Location and features Boats on Canada Bay. The shoreline of Canada Bay is largely open parkland, with some residential use to the north and east. The City West Link Road, a major arterial road, runs along the southern shore of the bay. A suburb on the shore of the bay is named after it, as is the City of Canada Bay, the local government area encompassing a large portion of inner-western Sydney. History The name Canada Bay honours a link between Australia and Canada. Following the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837 to 1838, two Irish and 58 French Canadian rebels were deported to Australia. At the request of the local Catholic bishop, they were brought to Sydney. Imprisoned at Longbottom Stockade (which was located at what is now Concord Oval), the convicts broke stone for the construction of Parramatta Road and collected oyster shells for making lime. In 1842, the French Canadians were allowed to work outside the prison. Between 1843 and 1844, all received pardons and, except for two people who died and one (Joseph Marceau) who settled in Dapto all returned to Canada. After the rebellions, the Australian Governor General and High Commissioner to Canada recommended that Britain grant responsible self-government to the Union of Upper and Lower Canada. In the 1850s, the Australian colonies achieved responsible government and parliamentary democracy. Many parts of Canada Bay are a reminder of this history: Exile Bay, France Bay, Durham Street, Marceau Drive, Polding Street and Gipps Street. Bayview Park, occupying the headland at the northern end of the bay, has a plaque that honours the exiles and marks the point of disembarkation.

He was a professor emeritus of the Institute of Child Health at the University of London.  Biography  Tanner was born on 1 August 1920 in Camberley, Surrey, United Kingdom and was educated at Marlborough College and University College of the South West of England. His family travelled widely while he was a youth because his father, a soldier in the British Army, was stationed in various locations. Tanner was a top-ranked hurdler who might well have participated in the 1940 Summer Olympics which were to be held in London, but were cancelled after the outbreak of World War II. He decided to become a doctor and not follow his father into the military after his brother was killed early in the war. He attended St Mary's Hospital, London, under a scholarship in which he instructed fellow students in physical education. He went to the United States to complete his medical studies as part of a group of British students funded by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. He met his first wife, fellow physician Bernice Alture, while at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and performed his internship at Johns Hopkins Hospital.Weber, Bruce. \\"Dr. James M. Tanner, an Expert in How Children Grow, Is Dead at 90\\", The New York Times, 23 August 2010. Retrieved 24 August 2010. Tanner oversaw a study initiated by the British government at an orphanage in Harpenden starting in 1948. While the study had originally been planned to study the effects of malnutrition on children, Tanner charted and photographed the growth of the children in the study over a period of several years, developing the Tanner Scale, which measures sexual maturation in adolescents based on characteristics that can be objectively measured, including size of the genitals and the quantity of pubic hair. The data gathered led to the development of the modern growth chart, used by paediatricians around the world to monitor the pattern of growth in children through adolescence, with separate curves measuring the growth trajectory for boys and girls identified as maturing early, normal or late.Hall, Stephen S. \\"With His Bells and Curves, Human Growth Science Grew Up\\", The New York Times, 1 March 2005. Retrieved 24 August 2010. Based on his research, Tanner noted that 90% of an individual child's adult height is based on genetic factors, but that the environment is the key factor when thousands of children are studied. By studying the growth characteristics of large populations, Tanner concluded that community-wide data on adult height was an indicator of how a society fosters its youths. Tanner did early research on the use of human growth hormone to address children whose growth was significantly delayed and was responsible for selecting the small handful of children in the UK who would be treated with the limited supply of HGH extracted from human cadavers. After a number of patients worldwide died in 1985 due to an infectious brain disease spread by the HGH treatments, Tanner immediately stopped the therapy, but had patients who insisted that they were willing to take the risk to address their child's delayed growth. Treatments resumed in the 1990s following the introduction of genetically engineered human growth hormone. Tanner died at age 90 on 11 August 2010 in Wellington, Somerset, due to a stroke and prostate cancer. He was survived by his second wife, Gunilla, as well as by a daughter, Helen Phillips, a stepdaughter, a stepson and three granddaughters.

Fabrizi was one of the most militant and dedicated leaders of the Risorgimento, the movement aimed at the unification of Italy. Insurrections He took part in the Modena insurrection of 1831, and attempted to succour Ancona, but was arrested. After his release he went to Marseilles where he joined the Young Italy movement. Afterwards he organized, with Giuseppe Mazzini, the ill-fated Savoy expedition. Taking refuge in Spain, he fought against the Carlists, and was decorated for valour on the battlefield (18 July 1837). Conspiracies In 1837 he established a centre of conspiracy at Malta, endeavoured to dissuade Mazzini from the Bandiera enterprise, but aided Crispi in organizing the Sicilian revolution of 1848. With a company of volunteers he distinguished himself 1849 in the defence of Venice, afterwards proceeding to Rome, where he took part in the defence of San Pancrazio. Upon the fall of Rome he returned to Malta, accumulating arms and stores, which he conveyed to Sicily, after having worked with Crispi to prepare the Sicilian revolution of 1860. Governorship While Giuseppe Garibaldi was sailing from Genoa towards Marsala, Fabrizi landed at Pozzillo, and, after severe fighting, joined Garibaldi at Palermo. Under the Garibaldian Dictatorship he was appointed governor of Messina and minister of war. Returning to Malta after the Neapolitan plebiscite, which he had vainly endeavoured to postpone, he was recalled to aid Cialdini in suppressing brigandage. Diplomacy While on his way to Sicily in 1862, to induce Garibaldi to give up the Aspromonte enterprise, he was arrested at Naples by La Marmora. During the war of 1866 he became Garibaldis deputy chief of staff, and in 1867 he fought at Mentana. As a member of parliament from 1861 to 1865 he endeavoured to promote agreement between the leaders of the Left. From 1878 onwards worked to secure the return of Crispi to power. He died in March 1885, two years before the realization of this objective.

In 1982, its ads proclaimed that it had \\"140 locations, coast to coast\\". Its iconic flagship store was located at 259 Yonge Street in 1959 and moved to 347 Yonge Street two years later, remaining there from 1961 until it closed in 2007. Located at Yonge just north of Dundas, the store became part of a strip of music stores, nightclubs and taverns featuring live performance that produced the \\"Toronto Sound\\" and was the centre of Toronto's music scene in the 1960s. The Yonge Street store was the best known store in the Sam the Record Man chain of 140 locations across Canada, two blocks away from the Eaton Centre and Dundas Square. Sam's became a popular attraction, drawing people into its selection of LP records, and later cassettes and compact discs. It flourished in the Downtown Toronto area, quickly gaining notoriety and outselling the competition. What started as a single storefront had evolved into an entire block completely dedicated to the Sam the Record Man store. For several years, the store went into head-to-head competition with the popular A&A; Records flagship store, just up the street, before the latter filed for bankruptcy in 1993. The building was demolished over a period of two years, from 2009 until 2011. It is part of the site on which the Ryerson University Student Learning Centre was built. The store's iconic neon sign has been restored and installed in a new location overlooking nearby Yonge-Dundas Square. The Information Age, competition with the HMV chain and other factors, forced Sam the Record Man into bankruptcy in 2001, but its flagship location remained in business until 2007. One independent franchise store, in Belleville, Ontario, continues to bear the Sam the Record Man name.  Founding  Sniderman's Music Hall was launched in 1937 by Sam Sniderman (d. September 23, 2012) and Sidney Sniderman, as the record department in his family's existing store, Sniderman Radio Sales & Service, at 714 College Street (now home to L Squared Salon) in Toronto, which had itself been established in 1920. In 1959, Sniderman's Music Hall moved to Yonge Street in order to compete with A&A; Records, and was located in the basement of Yolle Furniture Store at 291–295 Yonge Street. On Labour Day 1961, the new store moved north to its location at 347 Yonge Street, two doors down from A&A;, where it became a Toronto landmark.From a newspaper ad in the collection of Frederick Harrison, former store employee 1981–2007. The flagship store of the competing A&A; Records chain was located nearby at 351 Yonge Street. Steeles Tavern, a popular nightclub and live music venue, was between the two stores at 349 Yonge Street until it closed in 1974.  Iconic neon signs  Sam's famous neon signs at night, the 'record' on the right is the original store, with the record to the left on the former Steele's Tavern. The Yonge Street location was always noted for its kitschy signage. Store without the sign next to Steeles Tavern With Sam the Record Man growing rapidly, the business added the first of two spinning records that would later become its trademark. The first record, added at 347 Yonge Street, was designed by the Markle Brothers in 1969–70; it was 7.5 metres wide and 8 metres tall. The second sign was added in 1987, just north of the original, at 349 Yonge Street (former Steeles Tavern Restaurant). It was designed by Claude Neon Inc. In that same year, the letters spelling out \\"SAM\\" were added above the records (it took 550 light bulbs to light up the two SAM signs), as was the lower signage that read \\"Yes this is SAM the Record Man\\". The insert in the middle of the records reading \\"That's Entertainment\\" was also added at this time. Its first neon signage included the store's address in large neon \\"347\\" numbers vertically aligned between two windows. To see a facsimile of these signs, see the Cygnals story. On the left side was a thermometer made from neon. On the far right was a neon multi-sectioned triangle similar to the one on top of the Canada Life Building, which indicated weather conditions depending on how it was blinking. In the late 1960s, the iconic spinning record replaced the previous neon signs, with the second neon record being added in the mid 1980s. The buildings where the sign hung were two Second Empire structures (347 Yonge was formerly McDonald and Wilson Lighting store with the second floor bricked off to allow for the sign to be installed, 349 Yonge was Steeles' Tavern, whose upstairs windows had been bricked off when the store became a women's fashion store (Le Chateau) following the closing of the restaurant. Both buildings have since been demolished. 1960s A third floor was built onto the back portion of the original 347 Yonge Street store sometime in the 1960s and a basement stockroom excavated. It served as the Third Floor Bargain Basement for many years before becoming the first video department for the store. Concert tickets were sold there for a time as well. An additional property was purchased several stores to the north (371 and 375 Yonge?) which became Sam the Tape Man (formats open reel, 4 track, 8 track, and cassette) with Sam the Chinese Food Man upstairs. When Sam found out that his favourite Chinese restaurant was being demolished to make way for the new Toronto City Hall, Sam offered the restaurant the upstairs of his Sam the Tape Man store as a new location. It served as the venue for many flagship store, franchise, and record industry functions over the years. In the early 1970s, Sam the Tape Man was relocated to the 347 Yonge store and the space rented to an adult bookstore. The restaurant was eventually closed and the building sold and fully renovated into two Asian restaurants. 1970s The parking lot behind the adjoining Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) at Yonge and Gould St. was purchased in the early 1970s and an annex built which housed the classical department and later added the tape department (now only cassettes and 8-tracks), when it was incorporated back into the 347 location. CIBC restricted the height of the annex building to slightly below the height of the bank building, which prevented the addition of a second story, though a low-ceiling mezzanine was included for use as a stock area. 1980s Steeles' Tavern at 349 Yonge Street closed in 1974 and the building was acquired by Sniderman in the early 1980s; however, the ground floor was rented out to a stereo equipment store. After cutting access doorways through the walls to the existing store, the second floor became the CD department and a greatly reduced-in-size Bargain Basement. Eventually the ground floor and basement of 349 Yonge Street were incorporated via doorways cut through the walls into the adjoining record store, with the 45s department moving to the back of 347 Yonge St. The ground floor of 349 Yonge became a greatly expanded CD department, the second floor became the video department, and a third floor was added to the back portion of the building to house the video rental library, staff lunch room, and new staff washrooms. The Bargain Basement was restored to the third floor of 349 Yonge Street. When CDs were incorporated into their respective departments, the video store was relocated to the ground floor of 349 Yonge Street. 1990s The chain branched out into computer software and games in the mid-1990s and a new department, Sam The Interactive Man, was created on the now-adjoined and renovated third floors to house it. It was later moved briefly to the ground floor, prior to the expansion of the store into the CIBC property. In 1991 the CIBC property (341, 343, and 345 Yonge Street) was purchased and the store was reconfigured yet again with the Pop/Rock department moving to the ground floor of the new property. New cashier stations were installed at the front of 347 Yonge where the pop/rock department had been. A two-stage plan of renovation/construction involving the CIBC building and the classical annex were drawn up but only the first stage of the reconstruction was completed. The renovations comprised the creation of doorways from the CIBC building into the classical annex, the addition of stairs and a mezzanine which became the new location for Sam's Interactive. When the interactive department was closed it became the Nexx Level, which comprised the relocated R&B;/Soul/Rap/Electronic department. The Jazz department was moved to the second floor of 349 Yonge St. and the Pop Vocal and Instrumental departments moved to the second floor where jazz had been. Huge outdoor video screens were installed by an advertising firm on the (rented) lower portions of the roof of the former CIBC building. Extensive neon signage, including a replica of the original neon sign for Sniderman Radio Sales & Service, was installed in the former CIBC building. The third floor was turned into offices and fulfilment area when the store expanded to online sales. 2000s Major renovations followed the re-consolidation of the company after bankruptcy (January 2002). Much of this work was redecoration of the sales areas in terms of painting, lighting, flooring, and the inclusion of vintage fixtures such as a bar with mirrors, wood-and-glass display cabinet, and a barber shop counter/mirror. Classical was moved to the newly renovated ground floor of 349 Yonge Street and the Jazz, Blues, & Folk department was temporarily moved back to the second floor of 349 Yonge St. while redecorating took place, then moved back when the renovations were completed. The former classical annex was transformed into a new DVD department, complete with a chandeliers, theatrical spot lights, drapes, popcorn machine, 5.1 sound system, video monitors, neon sign, and theatre marquee. A small stage was also added for in-store performances. Renovations were also done on the ground floor of 347 Yonge, primarily the addition of a magazine section and a new cashier desk. The Pop/Rock Department and Nexx Level were also renovated. The former parkette (Hacksel Place) and chess tables on Gould Street were made over and incorporated into a café added to the Pop/Rock department. At one point limited menu food service was provided by Lick's hamburger chain. Notable customers Sam Sniderman was known as a friend to people starting out in the Canadian music industry, and helped jumpstart the careers of the likes of Anne Murray, Rush, Gordon Lightfoot and The Guess Who, who were all known to appear at the store from time to time. Bankruptcy and change of ownership When the Sam the Record Man chain was forced into bankruptcy in 2001, Sniderman's sons Jason and Robert (\\"Bobby\\") took over the flagship store. The two men kept the store running until announcing on May 29, 2007, that the store would close permanently on June 30 of that same year, citing the impact of technology on record sales as the determining factor of the closure.  The flagship store in film and music  The double-disc neon sign is frequently visible in films shot in Toronto that use Yonge Street as a location. Recent examples include the 2008 film The Incredible Hulk, which features the signs prominently during the final battle sequences, and the CTV/CBS series Flashpoint, which is set in Toronto. While the exterior of the buildings has been seen in the movies listed above, the interior has not. There exists a common misunderstanding that scenes from Donald Shebib's classic Canadian movie Goin' Down the Road were shot inside the store when they were, in fact, shot inside nearby rival A&A; Records.Frederick Harrison, based on recollections of the layout of A&A; Records in the early 1970s. The flagship store is alluded to in the song \\"Brian Wilson\\" by Toronto-based band Barenaked Ladies; it is referred to as \\"the late night record shop\\". For a brief time in the 1910s, 347 Yonge Street was the location of music publishers Chappell & Co, now Warner/Chappell Music.Address printed on sheet music from the collection of Frederick Harrison, former Sam's employee.  Building the chain  Los Lobos at Sam the Record Man The flagship Sam the Record Man store was famous for its Boxing Day sales and often served as the location for newspaper and television reports on Boxing Day shopping. Shoppers would line up over many city blocks, in the cold, to get one-day-only specially discounted (20%–25%) records, and eventually, as the technology changed, CDs, and videos. Prices for videotapes were discounted as much as 50%. The store was also known for its deep catalogue, eclectic selection of imported recordings, time specials, and ever- changing stock of deleted or cut out stock. Some of the walls bore autographs and photographs of various musicians and celebrities (among them Elton John, Iggy Pop, Bruce Springsteen, Liberace, Tony Bennett, Charles Aznavour) who had visited the store. There were in-store appearances (Radiohead, Meatloaf) and, in the later years, in-store performances by various musical artists (Gordon Lightfoot, Blue Rodeo, Daniel Lanois, Saga, Don Ross, Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper, Luka Bloom, Los Lobos). T-shirts and later a complete line of \\"Sam's Wear\\" were available for customers to purchase.Recounted by Frederick Harrison, former Sam the Record Man store employee 1981-2007. The chain stores were early promoters of Canadian artists, because they prominently featured their work with in-store displays, and concerts. Well-known Canadian artists like Loreena McKennitt, Barenaked Ladies, k d lang, Cowboy Junkies, and Ron Sexsmith had their first recordings stocked or consigned at the Yonge Street flagship store, then later throughout the chain.Recounted by Frederick Harrison, former Sam The Record Man store employee 1981-2007. Sam Sniderman played a role in getting the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to implement Canadian content (Can-con) regulations for radio stations in the early 1970s. The move to Can-con allowed many Canadian musicians to gain a voice in their own country. In addition to stocking (and later purchasing) the complete catalogue of the Canadian Talent Library broadcast music (see entries for Chad Allan, Jackie Mittoo, Dr. Music, Peter Appleyard), the flagship store also received copies of every LP record released in Quebec, making it the best source for French Canadian recordings outside of the province of Quebec. In the late 1960s, Sniderman expanded the business with franchise and corporate stores in Toronto and elsewhere. The expanded business was called Roblan Distributors (named for Sam Sniderman's son Robert and Sid Sniderman's daughter Lana (d. August 2012)) and conducted business at the store level as Sam the Record Man. Some stores were not full franchises but used Roblan Distributors as their principal rack jobber and were known as RD 2000 stores. A warehouse to service the franchises and flagship store was established at 110 Bond Street incorporating the accounting and head offices which had previously been located at Yonge Street. It later moved to much larger facilities at 274 Church Street. This building was demolished and became a parking lot in the late 1990s after record companies agreed to direct ship orders to the franchise stores, thus rendering the need for a central warehouse redundant. (Previous to this the record companies would ship at no cost only to a few designated locations and that with a minimum order value.) The accounting, offices, and some warehousing facilities were moved back to 110 Bond Street, but closed when the chain filed for bankruptcy. Both properties were sold to Ryerson University along with the Yonge Street properties in January 2008. The chain subsequently expanded to 130 stores (including RD2000 stores) across Canada, before the recorded music and media business started to decline in the 1990s. At one time, the chain was the leading music retailer in Canada. The chain published a free music magazine (Network) in the late 1980s. One of the features in the magazine was a picture of a commissioned work of art (painting, collage, sculpture) by a local artist (among them Mendelson Joe and Kurt Swinghammer) depicting the store or brand. Some of these graphics were displayed in light boxes installed throughout the store or as the graphics for \\"Sam's Wear\\".  2001 bankruptcy  The last Sam the Record Man location, in the Quinte Mall in Belleville, Ontario In 2001, tough competition, narrow margins, and the availability of free music downloads from the Internet, forced the chain to declare bankruptcy. Most of its 30 corporate-owned stores closed. The Sniderman family was underwriting the chain's debt of $15 million for the previous five years and finally could not continue to lose money. Under new management, Sam Sniderman's sons Jason and Bobby Sniderman reopened the Yonge Street store in 2002, along with 11 franchise stores outside of Toronto. The franchise stores were not a part of the bankruptcy filing, but the corporate stores were. Eventually, all but one of the corporate stores closed. The last corporate store, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, was shut down on February 20, 2007.  Yonge Street flagship store closes  On May 29, 2007, Jason and Bobby Sniderman announced that the iconic flagship store, on Toronto's Yonge and Gould Streets, would close permanently on June 30, 2007. They stated that \\"their decision reflects the increasing impact of technology on the record industry.\\" There was also increasing pressure to rent out some of the property or sell it to Ryerson University. On May 30, 2007, supporters started a Facebook group to save the store's neon spinning record signs titled \\"Save the Sam's Sign!!!\\"; the group, and its attached online petition, garnered more than 18,000 members. On June 14, 2007, it was announced that the signage, and some of the fixtures and memorabilia from the store, would be auctioned by Benaco Sales on June 27. The remaining stock had been greatly reduced to sell but was not sold at the auction sale. However, on June 22, 2007, the Toronto city council voted in favour of designating the entire property as a heritage site, protecting the entire building, including the landmark signs. The entire building was designated because the Ontario Heritage Act has no provisions to protect store signs. The corner of Yonge & Gould St. as of 2012. The site at 347 Yonge Street was a valuable piece of property and was purchased by Ryerson University in early 2008. The site sat vacant for several months before the spinning records were lit again at Nuit Blanche on October 4, 2008, although Ryerson owned the building at the time. On January 18, 2008, Ryerson University acquired the property for future expansion of its nearby campus. On October 4, 2008, the iconic neon signs were lit for the last time as part of Toronto's Nuit Blanche festivities. The removal of the signage commenced shortly after the final lighting, and by mid-March 2009 the building had been partially demolished. About a year after the lighting of the records at Nuit Blanche, demolition of the structure began. The building was demolished in early 2010. The new Ryerson Student Learning Centre (SLC) opened on February 23, 2015, on the old Sam's site. The closing of the flagship store left two Ontario-based franchise stores in operation, one in Sarnia and one in Belleville. The Sarnia store closed in 2009; the last remnant of the Sam the Record Man retail empire is now one former franchise store that remains open under the Sam the Record Man name in Belleville as an independent store. Sign preservation at Yonge-Dundas Square The neon spinning records and storefront signage preserved at Yonge-Dundas Square Under a heritage preservation deal with the city, Ryerson University was expected to restore the spinning record signs and incorporate them into the new Student Learning Centre on the former Sam's site. However, the university later stated that the signs were not compatible with their designs for the new building. In July 2014, city council approved a revised agreement with Ryerson, whereby the university would pay to install and maintain the sign atop a city-owned building at 277 Victoria St., two blocks southeast of the original location.

Its name is derived from the 1660s when English settlers named the area where the facility currently stands in honor of Olde Ben Pimlico's Tavern in London. The racetrack is nicknamed \\"Old Hilltop\\" after a small rise in the infield that became a favorite gathering place for thoroughbred trainers and race enthusiasts. It is currently owned by the Stronach Group. History Pimlico officially opened in the fall of 1870, with the colt Preakness winning the first running of the Dinner Party Stakes. Three years later the horse would have the 1873 Preakness Stakes named in his honor. The track is also noted as the home for the match race in which Seabiscuit beat War Admiral in the second Pimlico Special, on November 1, 1938, before a crowd of 43,000. The capacity of the stadium is 98,983. The Preakness Stakes and the Pimlico Special are run at a distance of 1 3/16 miles. The Pimlico track record for that distance is held by Farma Way, who set it while winning the Pimlico Special in 1991. In the century and more since its opening, Pimlico Race Track has weathered much outside history including the 1904 Great Fire of Baltimore, Great Depression of the 1930s, and several notable Baltimore riots. Pimlico also survived Prohibition and even an anti-gambling movement in 1910. As Alfred G. Vanderbilt said, \\"Pimlico is more than a dirt track bounded by four streets. It is an accepted American institution, devoted to the best interests of a great sport, graced by time, respected for its honorable past.\\" The races held at Pimlico, especially the Preakness, draw spectators from the Mid-Atlantic region. In 2007, the official attendance was 121,263 for the Preakness, the most people to watch a sporting event in Maryland history. More than $87.2 million in bets were made. On March 23, 2010 an agreement was reached to sell the two Maryland Jockey Club tracks (Pimlico and Laurel Park) from Magna Entertainment Corporation to its parent company, MI Development. On May 7, Penn National, with MI Development, announced they would jointly own and operate the Maryland Jockey Club. Penn National, which began in 1973, operating a thoroughbred race track near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, has grown to become the largest racetrack operator in the country.Penn National To Jointly Own and Run Pimlico Race Course, Home Of The Preakness In June 2011, The Stronach Group took control of the tracks when MI Development bought out Penn National Gaming's minority stake in the Maryland Jockey Club, which owned Laurel Park Racecourse, Pimlico, and a training facility in Bowie. The Stronach Group is owned by Canadian horse breeder and owner Frank Stronach, who also was MI Development's chairman and chief executive, a position he gave up in order to run Maryland's racetracks. Penn National bought a 49% stake in the Jockey Club in 2010 in hopes of securing a slots license at Laurel Park. In February 2017, the Maryland Stadium Authority released the first phase of a study saying that Pimlico needed $250 million in renovations. In 2018, the track began using a GPS-based timing system. A study into a renovation was ongoing as of January 2018. A report issued on December 14, 2018 suggested the existing buildings be demolished and rebuilt. In a meeting held in June 2018 by the Maryland Stadium Authority, locals \\"overwhelmingly supported upgrading the track property.\\" The Preakness Stakes took place at Pimlico in May 2019, with media reports suggesting that future Preakness races could be moved to Laurel Park. In October 2019, The Stronach Group reached an agreement in principle with the city of Baltimore and groups representing Maryland horsemen that would permanently keep the Preakness at Pimlico. As part of the agreement, The Stronach Group would donate both Pimilco and Laurel Park to newly-established government entities that would oversee the properties, with Stronach licensed to conduct the race meets. Pimlico's grandstand would be demolished and replaced with a smaller structure, and temporary seating would be added to handle the attendance during Preakness week. The race track itself would be rotated 30 degrees in order to create nine parcels of land that could be sold for private development, and new barns for horses would be constructed. The Racing and Community Development Act, approved by the Maryland state legislature in May 2020, allows the Maryland Stadium Authority to issue $375 million in bonds for the renovation of both Stronach Group tracks. \\"The Great Race\\" On October 24, 1877, the United States Congress shut down for a day so its members could attend a horse race at Pimlico. The event was a 2½-mile match race run by a trio of champions: Ten Broeck, Tom Ochiltree, and Parole. Ten Broeck, the Kentucky champion, was owned by F. B. Harper. Tom Ochiltree, the Eastern champion and winner of the 1875 Preakness Stakes, was owned by George L. Lorillard, an heir to the Lorillard tobacco fortune. Parole, a gelding, was owned by Pierre Lorillard IV. Parole, with William Barrett up, prevailed with a late run, crossing the finish line three lengths ahead of Ten Broeck and six ahead of Tom Ochiltree, which had helped to set the early pace with Barbee in the irons. An estimated 20,000 people crowded into Pimlico to witness the event. The event is depicted in a four-ton stone bas relief—copied from a Currier & Ives print and sculpted in stone by Bernard Zuckerman—hanging over the clubhouse entrance at Pimlico. It is long and high and is gilded in 24-karat gold leaf. Description The track has a one-mile dirt oval, surrounding a seven-furlong (7/8 mile) turf oval. There are stables for about 1,000 horses. Pimlico's capacity, including the infield, is over 120,000 people. The track area is bounded by Park Heights and Winner Avenues to the west, West Rogers Avenue and West Northern Parkway to the north, Preakness Way to the east, and West Belvedere Avenue to the south. (Its namesake street, Pimlico Road, runs from the city line near Greenspring Avenue to Park Heights Avenue south of Cold Spring Lane, but is rendered discontinuous to through traffic between Northern Parkway and Belvedere Avenue.)

It was filmed in Austin, San Antonio, and McDade, Texas. The series covers five decades, from the Texas Revolution through Native American uprisings and the Civil War to the early stages of the women's suffrage movement.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/475737/True-Women/ This miniseries was first aired on the CBS television network over two nights during May 1997. Plot summary The story starts with young Euphemia Texas Ashby (Tina Majorino) and her older sister Sara McClure (Dana Delany). When Euphemia gets back to the house from picking flowers she finds out that Sam Houston is coming to the house. Santa Anna is on his way so they must head east in the Runaway Scrape. While they attempt to cross a river Sara suffers from a miscarriage while her young son Little Johnnie dies in Euphemia's arms. Many other young and old Texans die and Euphemia is almost lost in a sea of graves. After a month and a week, Sam Houston defeats Santa Anna's army and Texas is reborn as the Republic of Texas. They now live in a new home with their horses. Their sisters Fannie and Jane Isabella come to live with them after their father dies at sea. They are very different from Sara and Phemie (Annabeth Gish) and must adapt to their new brutal life. One year later, Sarah survives an encounter with Tarantula (Michael Greyeyes), a Comanche warrior, and his band of Comanches. Later, Euphemia's close friend Matilda \\"Maddie\\" Lockhart (Anne Tremko) is abducted by the Comanches and only later released. When given back, the Texans discover that she was brutally tortured, with the right side of her face disfigured by burn scars; the Comanche repeatedly awakened her by placing burning coals on her face. Maddie is bloody and shows signs of beating everywhere. She never fully recovers from her time with the Native Americans. Euphemia is now sixteen and almost gets attacked by a panther when William King (Matthew Glave), a boy who she dreams about frequently, saves her. They continue to talk every day for the next five years and then get married. Sara's own husband dies in battle, and she gets remarried to a musician. Euphemia has a few children with William while they live happily together with the slave Tildy (Khadijah Karriem). They have a few horses, including one called Dancer. Euphemia meets Tarantula once again at a show (he is one of the actors) and since he is walking far for an old man, she gives him Dancer, her best horse. He gives her the name \\"Brave Squaw Child\\". This is the end of Euphemia's life in the book. Cherokee (Julie Carmen) and Lewis (Michael York) want to leave Georgia because Cherokee is half Creek and they were being driven out. They wanted to leave before they were forced to. Georgia Lawshe Woods (Angelina Jolie) falls in love at the age of fifteen at Swann Lake when two dogs frighten her and make her fall and Colonial Doctor Peter Woods (Jeffrey Nordling) tends to her wounds. She finds herself falling in love with this man and they get married the same year. They have four children a few years later and head to Texas. Along the way Georgia has doubts but Peter wants to keep going. They live in Texas for a while but find out the river water is contaminated, which leads to many deaths from cholera. They move again, and Georgia and Euphemia meet when Sam Houston keeps them together. The story then switches to Bettie Moss.

He is currently the goalkeeping coach at Middlesbrough. Playing career=QPR and Newcastle Bennett was born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, and started his football career as a YTS trainee with Queens Park Rangers in 1988. He turned professional with Newcastle United in March of the same season. Bennett never made a single first-team appearance for either club, and signed for Peterborough United in March 1991. Peterborough United Bennett signed for Peterborough United in March 1991. He made 89 appearances for the \\"Posh\\" (72 in the League) as they gained successive promotions from the old Fourth and Third Divisions between 1991 and 1993. After two seasons in the then First Division, Bennett moved on. Birmingham City Barry Fry signed Bennett for Birmingham City for £325,000 in December 1993. He became the first-choice goalkeeper, was ever- present as the club won the 1994–95 Second Division (third-tier) title, and remained as first choice for the next five years before losing his place to Kevin Poole in September 1998 because of injury. A broken finger in 1999–2000 pre-season extended his absence, but he returned to the team in October for a League Cup match at home to Newcastle United. With his first touch, he saved a penalty kick taken by Alan Shearer and Birmingham went on to win 2–0. He spoke after the match about his frustration with the injuries and his desire for first-team football, preferably with Birmingham. He kept his place for a few weeks before being dropped because of his contractual dispute with the club, but signed a new deal in January 2000 and returned to the side, continuing as first choice until a broken thumb ruled him out for the last two months of the season. With Poole also injured, loanee Thomas Myhre completed the campaign. Undisputed first choice the following season, Bennett helped Birmingham reach the 2001 League Cup Final, in which he made some fine saves in a losing cause as Liverpool won on penalties. Although the signings of Nico Vaesen in summer 2001 and Maik Taylor two years later meant that Bennett was not selected as often as he wanted, he still made his 350th Birmingham appearance in October 2003, keeping a clean sheet against Aston Villa. In late 2004 he was loaned to Sheffield United where he impressed manager Neil Warnock in the five games he played as cover for the injured Paddy Kenny. After this he was loaned to Coventry City. During his loan spell, his dismissal in the goalless draw to home to Stoke City made him the only Coventry goalkeeper to be sent off in a competitive match at Highfield Road. Leeds United On 17 June 2005, after 12 years at Birmingham, Bennett transferred to Leeds United who already had Scottish international Neil Sullivan as first-choice goalkeeper. Despite playing the pre-season friendlies, he was limited to four league appearances during the 2005–06 season, obtained deputising for the injured Sullivan. Sheffield United In July 2006, Bennett transferred for an undisclosed fee to newly promoted Premiership club Sheffield United, signing on a two-year deal to provide competition to the Blades' first-choice goalkeeper, Paddy Kenny. He played the first game of his second spell at the club at Bramall Lane against Reading on 16 September 2006. Bennett found first-team chances difficult to come by thanks to the fitness and form of Kenny; he made only nine starts in his first two seasons at Bramall Lane. His contract expired at the end of the 2007–08 season but despite reported interest from other clubs he signed a new one-year deal. The following season again saw his first team opportunities limited to only two league starts and appearances in cup competitions. Nevertheless, the club took up their option to extend his contract for a further year. Huddersfield Town On 17 June 2010, after leaving Sheffield United, he was signed by Football League One club Huddersfield Town, reuniting with Gary Naysmith and manager Lee Clark with whom he worked at Newcastle United. Bennett made his debut in the second round of the League Cup against Everton at Goodison Park, as a replacement for first-choice goalkeeper Alex Smithies. His first start for the Terriers was on 5 October, in the Football League Trophy match at the Galpharm Stadium against Peterborough United, which Town won 3–2. His first league start came four days later in the 3–0 win over Colchester United. He played more than expected due to injuries to Smithies. In a 2–0 win over Carlisle United on 1 February 2011, Bennett twice made saves from François Zoko. After the match, Carlisle United manager Greg Abbott praised Bennett performance and said: \\"They were wonder saves and saves change games. If one of those had gone in it would have been different.\\" On 18 May, he saved a penalty in the League One play-off semi- final penalty shootout against Bournemouth, which Huddersfield went on to win 4–2. The following season he saved two penalties in Town's 2–2 away draw with Scunthorpe United on 25 October 2011. At the end of the season, Bennett signed a new two-year contract which would see him stay on until the age of 42. Coaching career Bennett's playing contract expired in May 2014. However, after Nick Colgan was appointed as senior goalkeeping coach, Bennett was appointed to Colgan's previous role as goalkeeping coach for the Huddersfield Town academy. A year later, Bennett left the Yorkshire club after five years in order to take up an Academy coaching role at Nottingham Forest. Ahead of the 2020–21 season, he moved on to Middlesbrough to join Neil Warnock's staff as goalkeeping coach.

Significance of building's name The building's name identifies its purpose of accommodating \\"activities and services devoted to the promotion of world trade\\" as required for licensing of this name by the World Trade Centers Association. Baltimore is one of 16 charter members of the World Trade Centers Association. The landmark tower houses the headquarters of the Maryland Port Administration, the Maryland Department of Business and Economic Development and the World Trade Center Institute. The World Trade Center Institute is a member of the World Trade Centers Association and operates as a private, non- profit international business membership organization. Alignment and lighting The building was positioned so that a corner points out toward the waters of the Inner Harbor, suggesting the prow of a ship.Dorsey, John & Dilts, James D., A Guide to Baltimore Architecture (1997) p. 64. Tidewater Publishers, Centreville, Maryland Perched at the Harbor's edge, the building appears to rise out of the water when viewed from certain vantage points. It presents a frontal plane toward the city, across a broad plaza between the building and Pratt Street. In the base at each of the building's five recessed corners, 4,500-watt xenon spotlights dramatically illuminate the building at night, from the ground up, with oversized parabolic mirrors at the top of the five corners then reflecting the light outward in brilliant V-shaped beams. The \\"beacon\\" effect was loosely inspired by lighthouses found along the Chesapeake Bay. This signature lighting scheme, designed by Ray Grenald, is visible in the Baltimore skyline from seven to 10 miles away under favorable weather conditions. Installed in 1994, the xenon lighting system replaced 1,000-watt incandescent lamps originally installed at the base of the building, which illuminated only the first three floors.  Top of the World  240x240px An enclosed observation level on the 27th floor, called \\"Top of the World\\", provides a 360-degree panoramic view of the city. The Top of the World is handicap accessible, offers Baltimore history, rotating art exhibits, occasional special events, a gift shop featuring local art, and is home of the 9/11 Memorial of Maryland. The observation level is open to the public during daytime hours, and may be rented for special events by government organizations and corporations.\\"Top of the World\\" Baltimore Office of Promotion & the Arts. Retrieved 2010-10-18. Impact of September 11 attacks Two hours after the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center in New York City, Baltimore's World Trade Center was evacuated and closed. This was a response to a \\"credible\\" threat that the Baltimore building would also be attacked. A resident of southwest Baltimore was arrested that night and accused of giving the police a false warning. Unsubstantiated bomb threats received on September 12 and September 14 further contributed to security concerns at the building. A temporary barrier of concrete walls was erected around the brick plaza between the building and Pratt Street, closing the area to pedestrian and vehicle access. Four barges were moved to the building's harbor side to protect it from attack by boats. Due to the building's name and its prominent location on Baltimore's skyline, state officials presumed that a similar attack on other American cities would likely target the Baltimore World Trade Center. Their response was criticized, because \\"such drastic steps\\" were not taken at world trade center buildings in other cities. As security was relaxed later in the year, the concrete barriers and barges were removed. The exterior lighting system was turned off and remained dark until the end of 2007. The waterfront walkway beneath the building, an extension of the Harborplace promenade, is now only open to the public during daylight hours. 9/11 Memorial of Maryland at Baltimore's World Trade Center Memorial to the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks A memorial to the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks, built on the pedestrian promenade of the Baltimore World Trade Center between the building and Pratt Street, was dedicated on September 11, 2011, the tenth anniversary of the attacks. The memorial structure includes three 22-foot long steel beams from the New York World Trade Center, which were part of the 94th to 96th floors of the north tower. Twisted and fused together, the steel beams and damaged limestone pieces from the Pentagon’s west wall rest atop marble blocks bearing the names and birthdays of the 68 Marylanders who died in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Windows on the top floor of the Baltimore World Trade Center are marked with all of the names of the September 11 attack victims. Inscriptions on the marble platform, describing the events of the September 11 attacks, are arranged so that the building's shadow moves across them like a sundial. On September 11 each year, the shadow touches each inscription at the time that event occurred. The second exhibit memorializes the passengers of Flight 93 with a smooth, glossy granite block. The memorial was designed by the Baltimore architectural firm of Ziger/Snead and paid for by donations. Hurricane Isabel flooding Detail of the building from the Harbor Hurricane Isabel flooded the Baltimore World Trade Center's basement with of water in September 2003, destroying electrical, mechanical and telecommunications equipment serving the entire building, located there. The building remained closed for clean-up for more than a month after the hurricane struck, displacing 60 tenants. State ownership of building The building is owned by the Maryland Port Administration. As a result, there have been public discussions about whether it should be sold in debates over state budgets. In the \\"Maryland Transition\\" report to the incoming Governor Martin O'Malley in January 2007, the Transportation work group noted that former Governor Robert Ehrlich favored selling the Baltimore World Trade Center.\\"Maryland Transition\\" Transportation Workgroup (January 19, 2007), p. 16.

This project, scheduled for completion by April 20, 2012, uses floating frames to build a \\"wetlands\\" in Baltimore's inner harbor. The Waterfront Partnership, a nonprofit group serving the businesses located at the inner harbor, started the project with eight small wetland floats, funded in 2010 with a grant from Blue Water Baltimore. Although the original floats were destroyed by Hurricane Irene, students from the Living Classrooms Foundation and volunteers from T. Rowe Price have built 50 new floating frames to restore the floating wetland system. The inner harbor wetlands system is expected to extract at least two pounds of nitrogen from the water for every 100 pounds of grass growing on the floats. Its underside will also provide a habitat for small marine life, such as worms, barnacles, eels, crabs and mussels. Plants selected for the floats include a variety of marsh grasses which feed on nutrients from sewage leaks and storm runoff. Plastic beverage bottles, retrieved from trash floating in the inner harbor, are embedded in the structure of the floats to provide buoyancy.

It is located in central Essex County, New Jersey, within portions of Maplewood, Millburn and West Orange, and borders South Orange, between the first and second ridges of the Watchung Mountains.South Mountain Reservation, accessed April 7, 2007 Carved from wilderness at the end of the 19th century, designed by Olmsted Brothers, and developed over a few decades, the reservation has changed only slightly through the years. Preserved primarily in its wild state, woodlands abound in a variety of hardwood trees, and tall hemlocks tower above streams, creeks and ponds, and waterfalls. Higher points, such as Crater View, offer vistas of the New York and Jersey City skylines, Elizabeth, Union Township, and Staten Island. Recreational complex Richard J. Codey Arena and Turtle Back Zoo are located within the reservation's boundaries. The recreation area was expanded to include Safari Minigolf and the Treetop Adventure Ropes Course in 2010, and McLoone's Boathouse Restaurant abutting the Orange Reservoir was added in 2011. In 2013, a paddleboat concession was added, accessible from Cherry Lane, across from the Oakdale Picnic Area, and paths from the restaurant and zoo. Orange Reservoir Aerial view of Orange Reservoir Orange Reservoir is a reservoir located in the reservation's northern tract. Within the borders of West Orange, it is owned by the City of Orange and operated and maintained under contract with United Water. It was originally developed during the intense urbanization of northeastern New Jersey in the late 19th century, drawing from the Rahway River. The man-made lake is no longer part of the water-supply system and since the late 2000s (decade) various proposals have been made to allow its use as a recreational resource as part of the Recreational Complex. The complex abutting the reservoir includes a miniature golf course, and a boathouse-restaurant opened in 2011. Proposals were complicated by the fact that while owned by one municipality, it lies within the borders of another, and it is unclear whether it is taxable. Offers by the Essex County Park System to buy or lease property were put in place as a possible resolution. The county was able to reach an agreement to lease the reservoir from the City of Orange until 2032. In November 2013 it was announced that bridges and other improvements for recreational use would be made.http://essexnewsdaily.com/news/westorange/walking-path-bridges-around- orange-reservoir-complete Dam proposal There have been several proposals for easing the damage caused by heavy rains, which include damming the Rahway River, with headwaters in the reservation. History=Revolutionary era Washington Rock is a Revolutionary War historic site, dating back to the late 18th century when Beacon Signal Station 9 was located here—one of 23 beacons built by General Washington to observe British troop movements quartered on Staten Island and New York City. It was from this outlook that, on June 23, 1780, Essex County and Newark Militia were first warned that the British had launched an attack westward toward \\"the Gap\\", (Hobart Gap), a natural pathway to Washington's troops encamped at Morris Town. In a pincer movement designed to gain access to the Gap, Hessian troops fought bitterly along Vaux Hall Road, while the British advanced along Galloping Hill Road, until they were repelled, the Hessians at the base of the mountain and the British in Springfield.Thomas Fleming, The Forgotten Victory (New York: Reader's Digest Press, distributed by E. P. Dutton & Co., Inc, 1973) Development In 1860, wolves, bears and cougars were observed in the area, and there was a bounty on them. In 1896, John Durand, the son of Asher Brown Durand, described the mountain that includes South Mountain Reservation > a wilderness, as it probably existed at the time of Hendrick Hudson, a > primitive forest abounding with deer and other wild animals, and traversed > by streams alive with trout. Game was plentiful—partridges, quail, woodcock, > rabbits, squirrels of every species, raccoons and foxes; while occasionally > a hungry bear that had trespassed on the farmyards in the vicinity would be > tracked to its den and shot. The reservation was built from land purchases begun in 1895. It took a decade to untangle the deeds and assemble all the lands at South Mountain. Before he delegated design of the Essex Parks to his stepson's firm, Frederick Law Olmsted visited the newly acquired reservation. He regarded it as some of the most beautiful and promising terrain he had ever seen anywhere. The design of South Mountain was finalized by the Olmsted Brothers in stages over the years. A good deal of construction work—trails, footbridges, shelters, etc.—was carried out by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s.

Synonymous terms for dendrimer include arborols and cascade molecules. However, dendrimer is currently the internationally accepted term. A dendrimer is typically symmetric around the core, and often adopts a spherical three-dimensional morphology. The word dendron is also encountered frequently. A dendron usually contains a single chemically addressable group called the focal point or core. The difference between dendrons and dendrimers is illustrated in the top figure, but the terms are typically encountered interchangeably. STM image. The first dendrimers were made by divergent synthesis approaches by Fritz Vögtle in 1978, R.G. Denkewalter at Allied Corporation in 1981, Denkewalter, Robert G., Kolc, Jaroslav, Lukasavage, William J.Denkewalter, Robert G. et al. (1981) \\"Macromolecular highly branched homogeneous compound\\" Donald Tomalia at Dow Chemical in 1983Tomalia, Donald A. and Dewald, James R. (1983) \\"Dense star polymers having core, core branches, terminal groups\\" and in 1985, and by George R. Newkome in 1985. In 1990 a convergent synthetic approach was introduced by Craig Hawker and Jean Fréchet. Dendrimer popularity then greatly increased, resulting in more than 5,000 scientific papers and patents by the year 2005. Properties Dendritic molecules are characterized by structural perfection. Dendrimers and dendrons are monodisperse and usually highly symmetric, spherical compounds. The field of dendritic molecules can be roughly divided into low-molecular weight and high-molecular weight species. The first category includes dendrimers and dendrons, and the latter includes dendronized polymers, hyperbranched polymers, and the polymer brush. The properties of dendrimers are dominated by the functional groups on the molecular surface, however, there are examples of dendrimers with internal functionality. Dendritic encapsulation of functional molecules allows for the isolation of the active site, a structure that mimics that of active sites in biomaterials. Also, it is possible to make dendrimers water-soluble, unlike most polymers, by functionalizing their outer shell with charged species or other hydrophilic groups. Other controllable properties of dendrimers include toxicity, crystallinity, tecto-dendrimer formation, and chirality. Dendrimers are also classified by generation, which refers to the number of repeated branching cycles that are performed during its synthesis. For example, if a dendrimer is made by convergent synthesis (see below), and the branching reactions are performed onto the core molecule three times, the resulting dendrimer is considered a third generation dendrimer. Each successive generation results in a dendrimer roughly twice the molecular weight of the previous generation. Higher generation dendrimers also have more exposed functional groups on the surface, which can later be used to customize the dendrimer for a given application. Synthesis Synthesis to second generation arborol One of the first dendrimers, the Newkome dendrimer, was synthesized in 1985. This macromolecule is also commonly known by the name arborol. The figure outlines the mechanism of the first two generations of arborol through a divergent route (discussed below). The synthesis is started by nucleophilic substitution of 1-bromopentane by triethyl sodiomethanetricarboxylate in dimethylformamide and benzene. The ester groups were then reduced by lithium aluminium hydride to a triol in a deprotection step. Activation of the chain ends was achieved by converting the alcohol groups to tosylate groups with tosyl chloride and pyridine. The tosyl group then served as leaving groups in another reaction with the tricarboxylate, forming generation two. Further repetition of the two steps leads to higher generations of arborol. Poly(amidoamine), or PAMAM, is perhaps the most well known dendrimer. The core of PAMAM is a diamine (commonly ethylenediamine), which is reacted with methyl acrylate, and then another ethylenediamine to make the generation-0 (G-0) PAMAM. Successive reactions create higher generations, which tend to have different properties. Lower generations can be thought of as flexible molecules with no appreciable inner regions, while medium-sized (G-3 or G-4) do have internal space that is essentially separated from the outer shell of the dendrimer. Very large (G-7 and greater) dendrimers can be thought of more like solid particles with very dense surfaces due to the structure of their outer shell. The functional group on the surface of PAMAM dendrimers is ideal for click chemistry, which gives rise to many potential applications. Dendrimers can be considered to have three major portions: a core, an inner shell, and an outer shell. Ideally, a dendrimer can be synthesized to have different functionality in each of these portions to control properties such as solubility, thermal stability, and attachment of compounds for particular applications. Synthetic processes can also precisely control the size and number of branches on the dendrimer. There are two defined methods of dendrimer synthesis, divergent synthesis and convergent synthesis. However, because the actual reactions consist of many steps needed to protect the active site, it is difficult to synthesize dendrimers using either method. This makes dendrimers hard to make and very expensive to purchase. At this time, there are only a few companies that sell dendrimers; Polymer Factory Sweden ABPolymer Factory AB, Stockholm, Sweden.Polymer Factory commercializes biocompatible bis-MPA dendrimers and DendritechDendritech Inc., from Midland, Michigan, USA.Dendritech. is the only kilogram-scale producers of PAMAM dendrimers. NanoSynthons, LLCHome. NanoSynthons. Retrieved on 2015-09-29. from Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA produces PAMAM dendrimers and other proprietary dendrimers. Divergent methods Schematic of divergent synthesis of dendrimers The dendrimer is assembled from a multifunctional core, which is extended outward by a series of reactions, commonly a Michael reaction. Each step of the reaction must be driven to full completion to prevent mistakes in the dendrimer, which can cause trailing generations (some branches are shorter than the others). Such impurities can impact the functionality and symmetry of the dendrimer, but are extremely difficult to purify out because the relative size difference between perfect and imperfect dendrimers is very small. Convergent methods Schematic of convergent synthesis of dendrimers Dendrimers are built from small molecules that end up at the surface of the sphere, and reactions proceed inward building inward and are eventually attached to a core. This method makes it much easier to remove impurities and shorter branches along the way, so that the final dendrimer is more monodisperse. However dendrimers made this way are not as large as those made by divergent methods because crowding due to steric effects along the core is limiting. Click chemistry Dendrimer Diels-Alder reaction. Dendrimers have been prepared via click chemistry, employing Diels-Alder reactions, thiol-ene and thiol-yne reactions and azide-alkyne reactions. There are ample avenues that can be opened by exploring this chemistry in dendrimer synthesis. Applications Applications of dendrimers typically involve conjugating other chemical species to the dendrimer surface that can function as detecting agents (such as a dye molecule), affinity ligands, targeting components, radioligands, imaging agents, or pharmaceutically active compounds. Dendrimers have very strong potential for these applications because their structure can lead to multivalent systems. In other words, one dendrimer molecule has hundreds of possible sites to couple to an active species. Researchers aimed to utilize the hydrophobic environments of the dendritic media to conduct photochemical reactions that generate the products that are synthetically challenged. Carboxylic acid and phenol-terminated water-soluble dendrimers were synthesized to establish their utility in drug delivery as well as conducting chemical reactions in their interiors. This might allow researchers to attach both targeting molecules and drug molecules to the same dendrimer, which could reduce negative side effects of medications on healthy cells. Dendrimers can also be used as a solubilizing agent. Since their introduction in the mid-1980s, this novel class of dendrimer architecture has been a prime candidate for host–guest chemistry. Dendrimers with hydrophobic core and hydrophilic periphery have shown to exhibit micelle- like behavior and have container properties in solution. The use of dendrimers as unimolecular micelles was proposed by Newkome in 1985. This analogy highlighted the utility of dendrimers as solubilizing agents. The majority of drugs available in pharmaceutical industry are hydrophobic in nature and this property in particular creates major formulation problems. This drawback of drugs can be ameliorated by dendrimeric scaffolding, which can be used to encapsulate as well as to solubilize the drugs because of the capability of such scaffolds to participate in extensive hydrogen bonding with water. Dendrimer labs throughout the planet are persistently trying to manipulate dendrimer's solubilizing trait, in their way to explore dendrimer as drug delivery and target specific carrier. For dendrimers to be able to be used in pharmaceutical applications, they must surmount the required regulatory hurdles to reach market. One dendrimer scaffold designed to achieve this is the Poly Ethoxy Ethyl Glycinamide (PEE-G) dendrimer. This dendrimer scaffold has been designed and shown to have high HPLC purity, stability, aqueous solubility and low inherent toxicity. Drug delivery Schematic of a G-5 PAMAM dendrimer conjugated to both a dye molecule and a strand of DNA. Approaches for delivering unaltered natural products using polymeric carriers is of widespread interest. Dendrimers have been explored for the encapsulation of hydrophobic compounds and for the delivery of anticancer drugs. The physical characteristics of dendrimers, including their monodispersity, water solubility, encapsulation ability, and large number of functionalizable peripheral groups make these macromolecules appropriate candidates for drug delivery vehicles. = Role of Dendrimer Chemical Modifications in Drug Delivery = Dendrimers are particularly versatile drug delivery devices due to the wide range of chemical modifications that can be made to increase in vivo suitability and allow for site-specific targeted drug delivery. Drug attachment to the dendrimer may be accomplished by (1) a covalent attachment or conjugation to the external surface of the dendrimer forming a dendrimer prodrug, (2) ionic coordination to charged outer functional groups, or (3) micelle-like encapsulation of a drug via a dendrimer-drug supramolecular assembly. In the case of a dendrimer prodrug structure, linking of a drug to a dendrimer may be direct or linker-mediated depending on desired release kinetics. Such a linker may be pH-sensitive, enzyme catalyzed, or a disulfide bridge. The wide range of terminal functional groups available for dendrimers allows for many different types of linker chemistries, providing yet another tunable component on the system. Key parameters to consider for linker chemistry are (1) release mechanism upon arrival to the target site, whether that be within the cell or in a certain organ system, (2) drug-dendrimer spacing so as to prevent lipophilic drugs from folding into the dendrimer, and (3) linker degradability and post-release trace modifications on drugs. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a common modification for dendrimers to modify their surface charge and circulation time. Surface charge can influence the interactions of dendrimers with biological systems, such as amine-terminal modified dendrimers which have a propensity to interact with cell membranes with anionic charge. Certain in vivo studies have shown polycationic dendrimers to be cytotoxic through membrane permeabilization, a phenomenon that could be partially mitigated via addition of PEGylation caps on amine groups, resulting in lower cytotoxicity and lower red blood cell hemolysis. Additionally, studies have found that PEGylation of dendrimers results in higher drug loading, slower drug release, longer circulation times in vivo, and lower toxicity in comparison to counterparts without PEG modifications. Numerous targeting moieties have been used to modify dendrimer biodistribution and allow for targeting to specific organs. For example, folate receptors are overexpressed in tumor cells and are therefore promising targets for localized drug delivery of chemotherapeutics. Folic acid conjugation to PAMAM dendrimers has been shown to increase targeting and decrease off-target toxicity while maintaining on-target cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutics such as methotrexate, in mouse models of cancer. Antibody-mediated targeting of dendrimers to cell targets has also shown promise for targeted drug delivery. As epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) are often overexpressed in brain tumors, EGFRs are a convenient target for site-specific drug delivery. The delivery of boron to cancerous cells is important for effective neutron capture therapy, a cancer treatment which requires a large concentration of boron in cancerous cells and a low concentration in healthy cells. A boronated dendrimer conjugated with a monoclonal antibody drug that targets EGFRs was used in rats to successfully deliver boron to cancerous cells. Modifying nanoparticle dendrimers with peptides has also been successful for targeted destruction of colorectal (HCT-116) cancer cells in a co-culture scenario. Targeting peptides can be used to achieve site- or cell-specific delivery, and it has been shown that these peptides increase in targeting specificity when paired with dendrimers. Specifically, gemcitabine-loaded YIGSR-CMCht/PAMAM, a unique kind of dendrimer nanoparticle, induces a targeted mortality on these cancer cells. This is performed via selective interaction of the dendrimer with laminin receptors. Peptide dendrimers may be employed in the future to precisely target cancer cells and deliver chemotherapeutic agents. The cellular uptake mechanism of dendrimers can also be tuned using chemical targeting modifications. Non- modified PAMAM-G4 dendrimer is taken up into activated microglia by fluid phase endocytosis. Conversely, mannose modification of hydroxyl PAMAM-G4 dendrimers was able to change the mechanism of internalization to mannose- receptor (CD206) mediated endocytosis. Additionally, mannose modification was able to change the biodistribution in the rest of the body in rabbits. = Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics = Dendrimers have the potential to completely change the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profiles of a drug. As carriers, the PK/PD is no longer determined by the drug itself but by the dendrimer’s localization, drug release, and dendrimer excretion. ADME properties are very highly tunable by varying dendrimer size, structure, and surface characteristics. While G9 dendrimers biodistribute very heavily to the liver and spleen, G6 dendrimers tend to biodistribute more broadly. As molecular weight increases, urinary clearance and plasma clearance decrease while terminal half-life increases. = Routes of Delivery = To increase patient compliance with prescribed treatment, delivery of drugs orally is often preferred to other routes of drug administration. However oral bioavailability of many drugs tends to be very low. Dendrimers can be used to increase the solubility and stability of orally-administered drugs and increase drug penetration through the intestinal membrane. The bioavailability of PAMAM dendrimers conjugated to a chemotherapeutic has been studied in mice; it was found that around 9% of dendrimer administered orally was found intact in circulation and that minimal dendrimer degradation occurred in the gut. Intravenous dendrimer delivery shows promise as gene vectors to deliver genes to various organs in the body, and even tumors. One study found that through intravenous injection, a combination of PPI dendrimers and gene complexes resulted in gene expression in the liver, and another study showed that a similar injection regressed the growth of tumors in observed animals. The primary obstacle to transdermal drug delivery is the epidermis. Hydrophobic drugs have a very difficult time penetrating the skin layer, as they partition heavily into skin oils. Recently, PAMAM dendrimers have been used as delivery vehicles for NSAIDS to increase hydrophilicity, allowing greater drug penetration. These modifications act as polymeric transdermal enhancers allowing drugs to more easily penetrate the skin barrier. Dendrimers may also act as new ophthalmic vehicles for drug delivery, which are different from the polymers currently used for this purpose. A study by Vanndamme and Bobeck used PAMAM dendrimers as ophthalmic delivery vehicles in rabbits for two model drugs and measured the ocular residence time of this delivery to be comparable and in some cases greater than current bioadhesive polymers used in ocular delivery. This result indicates that administered drugs were more active and had increased bioavailability when delivered via dendrimers than their free- drug counterparts. Additionally, photo-curable, drug-eluting dendrimer- hyaluronic acid hydrogels have been used as corneal sutures applied directly to the eye. These hydrogel sutures have shown efficacy as a medical device in rabbit models that surpasses traditional sutures and minimizes corneal scarring. = Brain Drug Delivery = Dendrimer drug delivery has also shown major promise as a potential solution for many traditionally difficult drug delivery problems. In the case of drug delivery to the brain, dendrimers are able to take advantage of the EPR effect and blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment to cross the BBB effectively in vivo. For example, hydroxyl- terminated PAMAM dendrimers possess an intrinsic targeting ability to inflamed macrophages in the brain, verified using fluorescently labeled neutral generation dendrimers in a rabbit model of cerebral palsy. This intrinsic targeting has enabled drug delivery in a variety of conditions, ranging from cerebral palsy and other neuroinflammatory disorders to traumatic brain injury and hypothermic circulatory arrest, across a variety of animal models ranging from mice and rabbits to canines. Dendrimer uptake into the brain correlates with severity of inflammation and BBB impairment and it is believed that the BBB impairment is the key driving factor allowing dendrimer penetration. Localization is heavily skewed towards activated microglia. Dendrimer- conjugated N-acetyl cysteine has shown efficacy in vivo as an anti- inflammatory at more than 1000-fold lower dose than free drug on a drug basis, reversing the phenotype of cerebral palsy, Rett syndrome, macular degeneration and other inflammatory diseases. = Clinical Trials = Starpharma, an Australian pharmaceutical company, has multiple products that have either already been approved for use or are in the clinical trial phase. SPL7013, also known as astodrimer sodium, is a hyperbranched polymer used in Starpharma’s VivaGel line of pharmaceuticals that is currently approved to treat bacterial vaginosis and prevent the spread of HIV, HPV, and HSV in Europe, Southeast Asia, Japan, Canada, and Australia. Due to SPL7013’s broad antiviral action, it has recently been tested by the company as a potential drug to treat SARS-CoV-2. The company states preliminary in-vitro studies show high efficacy in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells. Gene delivery and transfection The ability to deliver pieces of DNA to the required parts of a cell includes many challenges. Current research is being performed to find ways to use dendrimers to traffic genes into cells without damaging or deactivating the DNA. To maintain the activity of DNA during dehydration, the dendrimer/DNA complexes were encapsulated in a water-soluble polymer, and then deposited on or sandwiched in functional polymer films with a fast degradation rate to mediate gene transfection. Based on this method, PAMAM dendrimer/DNA complexes were used to encapsulate functional biodegradable polymer films for substratemediated gene delivery. Research has shown that the fast-degrading functional polymer has great potential for localized transfection. Sensors Dendrimers have potential applications in sensors. Studied systems include proton or pH sensors using poly(propylene imine), cadmium- sulfide/polypropylenimine tetrahexacontaamine dendrimer composites to detect fluorescence signal quenching, and poly(propylenamine) first and second generation dendrimers for metal cation photodetection amongst others. Research in this field is vast and ongoing due to the potential for multiple detection and binding sites in dendritic structures. Nanoparticles Dendrimers also are used in the synthesis of monodisperse metallic nanoparticles. Poly(amidoamide), or PAMAM, dendrimers are utilized for their tertiary amine groups at the branching points within the dendrimer. Metal ions are introduced to an aqueous dendrimer solution and the metal ions form a complex with the lone pair of electrons present at the tertiary amines. After complexation, the ions are reduced to their zerovalent states to form a nanoparticle that is encapsulated within the dendrimer. These nanoparticles range in width from 1.5 to 10 nanometers and are called dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles.  Other Applications  Given the widespread use of pesticides, herbicides and insecticides in modern farming, dendrimers are also being used by companies to help improve the delivery of agrochemicals to enable healthier plant growth and to help fight plant diseases. Dendrimers are also being investigated for use as blood substitutes. Their steric bulk surrounding a heme-mimetic centre significantly slows degradation compared to free heme, and prevents the cytotoxicity exhibited by free heme.

Founded in 1999, it is based on the ideology of the Meimad movement founded in 1988 by Rabbi Yehuda Amital. It was formed by dovish religious Zionists who supported the peace process and believed the National Religious Party had drifted too far to the right. At the national level, it was in alliance with the Labour Party, and, until the 2006 elections, received 10th spot on the Labour Knesset list. Meimad ended the pact with the 2009 election, formed an alliance with the Green Movement, and failed to win enough votes to be elected to the Knesset. History The Meimad movement was founded on 1 June 1988 by Rabbi Yehuda Amital, and included former National Religious Party Knesset member Yehuda Ben-Meir. It contested the November 1988 Knesset elections, receiving 0.7% of the vote and failing to cross the 1% electoral threshold. Eleven years later, a political arm was established, and joined the One Israel alliance that won the Knesset elections that year. Meimad received one seat, taken by Michael Melchior. It gained a second when Yehuda Gilad replaced Maxim Levy in 2002. Tova Ilan also represented Meimad in the Knesset for a brief spell in 2006, after several other Labour MKs resigned. It attracted moderates among immigrants from the English-speaking world, including Shimon Glick. In November 2008, minister and former Labour Party member Ami Ayalon joined Meimad. In the same month, the party ended its alliance with Labour after being told that 10th spot on the list would no longer be reserved for Meimad for the 2009 legislative elections. Shortly afterwards, Ayalon announced his resignation from politics, and the party has formed an umbrella alliance with the Green Movement. In 2012, Melchior announced that he would not stand for election. Ideology The party emphasizes the values of many social democratic parties, except on religious issues. Meimad, like Labour, takes a center-left approach to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. However, it supports religious studies in the main curriculum of Israel's public schools, and encourages the use of rabbinical courts in addition to civil courts. Under Melchior, the party has taken an even more left-leaning approach - both in foreign and, especially, in domestic affairs. The party has run in municipal elections in 2003, winning a number of key seats in Tel Aviv. It also ran together with Meretz party in Haifa in which it shares a seat under a rotation agreement. Shlomo Yaakov Rapaport serves on the Haifa city council representing Meimad, and is the chairman of the Haifa Aliyah and absorption committee, and the chairman of the municipal committee against alcohol and drug abuse.

They were introduced by Élie Cartan in his doctoral thesis. It controls the representation theory of a semi-simple Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} over a field of characteristic 0. In a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero (e.g., \\\\mathbb{C}), a Cartan subalgebra is the same thing as a maximal abelian subalgebra consisting of elements x such that the adjoint endomorphism \\\\operatorname{ad}(x) : \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{g} is semisimple (i.e., diagonalizable). Sometimes this characterization is simply taken as the definition of a Cartan subalgebra.pg 231. In general, a subalgebra is called toral if it consists of semisimple elements. Over an algebraically closed field, a toral subalgebra is automatically abelian. Thus, over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, a Cartan subalgebra can also be defined as a maximal toral subalgebra. Kac–Moody algebras and generalized Kac–Moody algebras also have subalgebras that play the same role for a Cartan subalgebra of a semisimple Lie algebra (over a field of characteristic zero).  Existence and uniqueness  Cartan subalgebras exist for finite-dimensional Lie algebras whenever the base field is infinite. One way to construct a Cartan subalgebra is by means of a regular element. Over a finite field, the question of the existence is still open. For a finite- dimensional semisimple Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, there is a simpler approach: by definition, a toral subalgebra is a subalgebra of \\\\mathfrak g that consists of semisimple elements (an element is semisimple if the adjoint endomorphism induced by it is diagonalizable). A Cartan subalgebra of \\\\mathfrak g is then the same thing as a maximal toral subalgebra and the existence of a maximal toral subalgebra is easy to see. In a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, all Cartan subalgebras are conjugate under automorphisms of the algebra, and in particular are all isomorphic. The common dimension of a Cartan subalgebra is then called the rank of the algebra. For a finite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra, the existence of a Cartan subalgebra is much simpler to establish, assuming the existence of a compact real form. Chapter 7 In that case, \\\\mathfrak{h} may be taken as the complexification of the Lie algebra of a maximal torus of the compact group. If \\\\mathfrak{g} is a linear Lie algebra (a Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra of endomorphisms of a finite-dimensional vector space V) over an algebraically closed field, then any Cartan subalgebra of \\\\mathfrak{g} is the centralizer of a maximal toral subalgebra of \\\\mathfrak{g}. If \\\\mathfrak{g} is semisimple and the field has characteristic zero, then a maximal toral subalgebra is self-normalizing, and so is equal to the associated Cartan subalgebra. If in addition \\\\mathfrak g is semisimple, then the adjoint representation presents \\\\mathfrak g as a linear Lie algebra, so that a subalgebra of \\\\mathfrak g is Cartan if and only if it is a maximal toral subalgebra.  Examples  *Any nilpotent Lie algebra is its own Cartan subalgebra. *A Cartan subalgebra of gln, the Lie algebra of n×n matrices over a field, is the algebra of all diagonal matrices. *For the special Lie algebra of traceless n\\\\times n matrices \\\\mathfrak{sl}_n(\\\\mathbb{C}), it has the Cartan subalgebra > \\\\mathfrak{h} = \\\\\\\\{ d(a_1,\\\\ldots,a_n)  a_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\text{ and } > \\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 0 \\\\\\\\} where > d(a_1,\\\\ldots,a_n) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} a_1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\ddots & & > 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\cdots &\\\\cdots &a;_n \\\\end{pmatrix} For example, in \\\\mathfrak{sl}_2(\\\\mathbb{C}) the Cartan subalgebra is the subalgebra of matrices > \\\\mathfrak{h} = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -a \\\\end{pmatrix} : a > \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} with Lie bracket given by the matrix commutator. *The Lie algebra sl2(R) of 2 by 2 matrices of trace 0 has two non-conjugate Cartan subalgebras. *The dimension of a Cartan subalgebra is not in general the maximal dimension of an abelian subalgebra, even for complex simple Lie algebras. For example, the Lie algebra sl2n(C) of 2n by 2n matrices of trace 0 has a Cartan subalgebra of rank 2n−1 but has a maximal abelian subalgebra of dimension n2 consisting of all matrices of the form {0\\\\ A\\\\choose 0\\\\ 0} with A any n by n matrix. One can directly see this abelian subalgebra is not a Cartan subalgebra, since it is contained in the nilpotent algebra of strictly upper triangular matrices (or, since it is normalized by diagonal matrices).  Cartan subalgebras of semisimple Lie algebras  For finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, a Cartan subalgebra \\\\mathfrak h has the following properties: *\\\\mathfrak h is abelian, *For the adjoint representation \\\\operatorname{ad} : \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{gl}(\\\\mathfrak{g}), the image \\\\operatorname{ad}(\\\\mathfrak h) consists of semisimple operators (i.e., diagonalizable matrices). (As noted earlier, a Cartan subalgebra can in fact be characterized as a subalgebra that is maximal among those having the above two propreties.) These two properties say that the operators in \\\\operatorname{ad}(\\\\mathfrak h) are simultaneously diagonalizable and that there is a direct sum decomposition of \\\\mathfrak{g} as :\\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\bigoplus_{\\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h}^*} \\\\mathfrak{g}_\\\\lambda where :\\\\mathfrak{g}_\\\\lambda = \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g} : \\\\text{ad}(h)x = \\\\lambda(h)x, \\\\text{ for } h \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h} \\\\\\\\}. Let \\\\Phi = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h}^* - 0  \\\\mathfrak{g}_\\\\lambda e 0 \\\\\\\\}. Then \\\\Phi is a root system and, moreover, \\\\mathfrak{g}_0 = \\\\mathfrak h; i.e., the centralizer of \\\\mathfrak{h} coincides with \\\\mathfrak{h}. The above decomposition can then be written as: :\\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\mathfrak{h} \\\\oplus \\\\left( \\\\bigoplus_{\\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\Delta} \\\\mathfrak{g}_\\\\lambda \\\\right) As it turns, for each \\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\Phi, \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\lambda} has dimension one and so: :\\\\dim \\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\dim \\\\mathfrak{h} + \\\\\\\\# \\\\Phi. See also Semisimple_Lie algebra#Structure for further information.  Decomposing representations with dual Cartan subalgebra  Given a Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} over a field of characteristic 0, and a Lie algebra representation > \\\\sigma: \\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\to \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V) there is a decomposition related to the decomposition of the Lie algebra from its Cartan subalgebra. If we set > V_\\\\lambda = \\\\\\\\{v \\\\in V : (\\\\sigma(h))(v) = \\\\lambda(h) v \\\\text{ for } h \\\\in > \\\\mathfrak{h} \\\\\\\\} with \\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h}, called the weight space for weight \\\\lambda, there is a decomposition of the representation in terms of these weight spaces > V = \\\\bigoplus_{\\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h}^*} V_\\\\lambda In addition, whenever V_\\\\lambda eq \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} we call \\\\lambda a weight of the \\\\mathfrak{g}-representation V. = Classification of irreducible representations using weights = But, it turns out these weights can be used to classify the irreducible representations of the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}. For a finite dimensional irreducible \\\\mathfrak{g}-representation V, there exists a unique weight \\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\Delta with respect to a partial ordering on \\\\mathfrak{h}^*. Moreover, given a \\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\Delta such that \\\\langle \\\\alpha, \\\\lambda\\\\rangle \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} for every positive root \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\Delta^+, there exists a unique irreducible representation L^+(\\\\lambda). This means the root system \\\\Delta contains all information about the representation theory of \\\\mathfrak{g}pg 240.  Splitting Cartan subalgebra  Over non- algebraically closed fields, not all Cartan subalgebras are conjugate. An important class are splitting Cartan subalgebras: if a Lie algebra admits a splitting Cartan subalgebra \\\\mathfrak{h} then it is called splittable, and the pair (\\\\mathfrak{g},\\\\mathfrak{h}) is called a split Lie algebra; over an algebraically closed field every semisimple Lie algebra is splittable. Any two splitting Cartan algebras are conjugate, and they fulfill a similar function to Cartan algebras in semisimple Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields, so split semisimple Lie algebras (indeed, split reductive Lie algebras) share many properties with semisimple Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields. Over a non-algebraically closed field not every semisimple Lie algebra is splittable, however.

The term can apply to the intervention of human intelligence, but most often refers to the automatic processing of incoming messages with anti-spam techniques - to outgoing emails as well as those being received. Email filtering software may reject an item at the initial SMTP connection stageWith a 5xx SMTP status code or pass it through unchanged for delivery to the user's mailbox - or alternatively: redirect the message for delivery elsewhere; quarantine it for further checking; edit or 'tag' it in some way. Motivation Common uses for mail filters include organizing incoming email and removal of spam and computer viruses. A less common use is to inspect outgoing email at some companies to ensure that employees comply with appropriate policies and laws. Users might also employ a mail filter to prioritize messages, and to sort them into folders based on subject matter or other criteria. Methods Mailbox providers can also install mail filters in their mail transfer agents as a service to all of their customers. Anti-virus, anti-spam, URL filtering, and authentication-based rejections are common filter types. Corporations often use filters to protect their employees and their information technology assets. A catch-all filter will \\"catch all\\" of the emails addressed to the domain that do not exist in the mail server - this can help avoid losing emails due to misspelling. Users, may be able to install separate programs (see links below), or configure filtering as part of their email program (email client). In email programs, users can make personal, \\"manual\\" filters that then automatically filter mail according to the chosen criteria. Inbound and outbound filtering Mail filters can operate on inbound and outbound email traffic. Inbound email filtering involves scanning messages from the Internet addressed to users protected by the filtering system or for lawful interception. Outbound email filtering involves the reverse - scanning email messages from local users before any potentially harmful messages can be delivered to others on the Internet. One method of outbound email filtering that is commonly used by Internet service providers is transparent SMTP proxying, in which email traffic is intercepted and filtered via a transparent proxy within the network. Outbound filtering can also take place in an email server. Many corporations employ data leak prevention technology in their outbound mail servers to prevent the leakage of sensitive information via email. Customization Mail filters have varying degrees of configurability. Sometimes they make decisions based on matching a regular expression. Other times, code may match keywords in the message body, or perhaps the email address of the sender of the message. More complex control flow and logic is possible with programming languages; this is typically implemented with a data-driven programming language, such as procmail, which specifies conditions to match and actions to take on matching, which may involve further matching. Some more advanced filters, particularly anti-spam filters, use statistical document classification techniques such as the naive Bayes classifier. Image filtering can use complex image-analysis algorithms to detect skin-tones and specific body shapes normally associated with pornographic images.

The name rash guard reflects the fact that the shirt protects the wearer against rashes caused by abrasion, or by sunburn from extended exposure to the sun. A rash guard shirt is usually worn by itself when surfing in weather too warm for a wetsuit to prevent chafing from sliding on and off of the waxed surface of the surf board. A surfboard's wax holds sand from the beach that can rub against a surfer while paddling out to the break, or legs while sitting atop one's board. Rash guards also offer some protection from the sun (measured by its Ultraviolet Protection Factor) and slight protection against jelly fish stings and are sometimes worn under wetsuits to prevent chafing. A rash guard helps to prevent irritation caused by rapid impact with surface water and waves as well.] A rash guard by itself is used for light coverage in warm temperatures for many other watersports including surfing, canoe polo, scuba diving, snorkeling, freediving, wakeboarding, bodysurfing, bodyboarding, windsurfing, kitesurfing, kayaking, stand up paddle surfing, or swimming. There are also lower body rash guards, which are similar to compression shorts to be worn under the surfers' boardshorts, but more specialized for surfers. Rash guards are thought to have originated in Australia, where they are commonly referred to as \\"rashies\\" or \\"rashys\\". Important features of a rash guard include flatlock stitching and multi-panel construction. Flatlock stitching creates a seam where the seam allowances lies flat to the garment instead of hanging loose from it. It is made by adjusting the overlock or the thread overedge stitch. Flatlock stitching increases the strength of the garment for intense exercise or recreational activities. Multi-panel construction and different material for separate body parts sewn together in panels allow the user increased mobility wet or dry versus the conventional tee shirt construction. The combination of products used to construct a rash guard differ slightly depending on the designer. The use of nylon and spandex create a garment that is lightweight, quick drying, flexible, durable, naturally antibacterial and water wicking. Variations Some variations include the following: *Cropped rash guard: A rash guard that is similar to a crop top and is made specifically for females. It can be paired with swimwear bottoms. *Rash guard overall/bodysuit: A hybrid one-piece swimsuit (with boyleg/short or classic bottoms) with rash guard material and design. There are designs for males and females and this variation is much catered to children.  Swim shirts  A woman wearing a swim shirt while surfing Swim shirts are relatively new to the consumer market, but are growing in popularity. They are generally more loose fitting and casually worn. Their primary purpose is to offer an alternative to sunscreen to protect the wearer's skin from the sun's UV radiation and possible skin cancer. Many swim shirts carry a UPF rating of 50+, which blocks out over 98% of the sun's harmful rays. Many people find that sunscreen isn't always enough because it is often not used properly and some have skin allergies or sensitivities to chemicals in sunscreens. Children's skin can be especially sensitive to the sun and sunscreens. Many children, and parents, find it is much easier to put on a swim shirt as it is loose and easily slipped on. There are also zip front rash guards available which makes slipping in and out of them even easier, especially when wet. Furthermore, it is comfortable and yet gives sun protection. Even though the name generally applies to water sports, people use swim shirts for an array of activities: swimming, boating, golfing, tennis, gardening, playing in the sprinklers, water parks, beach trips, pool play, rivers and lakes, water skiing, surfing, snow skiing, sledding, skimboarding, in mixed martial arts and Brazilian jiu- jitsu, and even as normal everyday clothing.  Rash guards for Grappling / MMA  Rash guards are also worn for training in various grappling sports and mixed martial arts (MMA). The potential, but not proven, benefits for this include: * Protect skin against mat burn. * Moisture control. * Compression effect on the muscles which is beneficial when it comes to preventing muscle sprain/strain. * Good hygiene practice.

He is best known for his autobiographical book Midnight Express about his experiences in and escape from a Turkish prison, after being convicted of smuggling hashish. He was one of hundreds of US citizens in foreign jails serving drug charge sentences, following a drug- smuggling crackdown by foreign governments. Background Hayes, an American student, was caught trying to smuggle four pounds of hashish out of Turkey on October 7, 1970. He was originally sentenced to four years and two months in a Turkish prison; with his release date weeks away, he learned that the authorities had chosen to penalize him with a life sentence for smuggling, instead of possession. Hayes was imprisoned at Sağmalcılar Prison in Istanbul.INTERVIEW WITH WILLIAM HAYES/CODEL MURPHY / 030925Z MAY 74, U.S. State Department, Ankara, May 1974. Following an incident in prison, he was transferred in 1972 to Bakırköy Psychiatric Hospital, described as a 'lunatic asylum'. On several occasions, the United States Department of State pressured Turkey to transfer sentencing to the United States; however, Turkish foreign minister Melih Esenbel stated that the US was not in a position to dispute a sentence issued by a Turkish court.HAYES CASE / 190938Z MAR 75, U.S. State Department telegram, Ankara, March 1975. He stated privately to officials that a release might be possible on humanitarian grounds, if Hayes' physical or mental health was deteriorating, but in a private consultation, Hayes stated to US diplomats that his experience at Bakırköy was highly traumatic, and he did not have confidence that the hospital would certify him for early release; Hayes also stated that he felt attempts to win early release would jeopardize his prospects of being transferred to a more desirable half-open prison. On May 12, 1975, the Turkish Constitutional Court declared amnesty for all drug offenses, which shortened Hayes' sentence from life to 30 years; he was transferred to İmralı Prison on July 11, 1975. Declassified telegrams from the State Department indicated that in discussions between the US embassy and Vahap Aşıroğlu, Turkish Director of Consular Affairs, the latter believed Hayes would probably be released from prison on parole in October 1978, which in practice meant that a local prosecutor would declare him persona non grata and expel him from the country.BILATERAL AGREEMENT FOR REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN NATIONAL PRISONERS TO COMPLETE SENTENCING IN OWN COUNTRY / 091243Z MAY 75, U.S. State Department, Ankara, May 1975 Hayes escaped from İmralı on October 2, 1975, taking a rowboat at night to Bandirma, blending in with locals, and then heading westbound across the border to Greece. After over two weeks of detention and interrogation to determine whether he possessed any useful intelligence about Turkey's military, he was deported from Thessaloniki to Frankfurt on October 20; after interrogation by US authorities in Frankfurt, Hayes spent several days in Amsterdam, and then returned to the United States. Book Hayes wrote a book on his experiences, Midnight Express, which was later adapted into the 1978 film of the same name starring Brad Davis as Hayes. The film was directed by Alan Parker, with a screenplay by Oliver Stone. The movie differs from Hayes' account in his book. Among the differences is a scene in which Hayes kills the prison guard Hamidou 'the Bear' (portrayed by Paul L. Smith), the main antagonist of the story. In fact, the prison guard was killed in 1973 by a recently released prisoner, whose family Hamidou had insulted while beating the prisoner, years before Hayes' actual escape. For legal reasons, the book and film adaptation were deliberately inaccurate. In one interview, Hayes admitted making several trips to Turkey to bring hashish back to the United States. His lawyer informed him that he could be arrested for such claims. In 2010, in an episode of National Geographic Channel's Locked Up Abroad, titled \\"The Real Midnight Express\\",Locked Up Abroad: The Real Midnight Express Hayes finally told his fully accurate version of being sent to the infamous Turkish prison in Sağmalcilar, eventually escaping from the Marmara Sea prison on İmralı island. Hayes has since written the sequels Midnight Return (Escaping Midnight Express) and The Midnight Express Letters - from a Turkish Prison, 1970-1975, the latter a collection of the original letters written home to family and friends during his imprisonment. Acting and writing Hayes is still active in the entertainment industry, specifically acting and writing. He appeared in the Charles Bronson film Assassination, as a hired killer. One of Hayes' successes was writing and directing 2003's Southside (later released in the US as A Cock and Bull Story) which won numerous awards, including the 2002 L.A. Drama Critics' Circle award. On June 30, 2010, the National Geographic television channel aired Locked Up Abroad: The Real Midnight Express. Hayes has been traveling the world with his one-man show, Riding the Midnight Express with Billy Hayes, since it premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2013. Interview on Midnight Express film During the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, Alinur Velidedeoğlu, a Turkish advertiser, met Hayes by chance and interviewed him on the film Midnight Express. Hayes expressed his disappointment with parts of the film adaptation, especially its portrayal of all Turks as bad, and his regret that Turkey's image was negatively affected by the film. Hayes also displayed affection for Turkey and the city of Istanbul. Although the Interpol warrant for him had by then been lifted, Hayes explained that while he wanted to return, he hesitated to do so, out of concern that many Turks might blame him for the negative publicity the movie had generated. The video was made available on YouTube. Hayes did finally return to Turkey on June 14, 2007, to attend the 2nd Istanbul Conference on Democracy and Global Security, organized by the Turkish National Police (TNP) and the Turkish Institute for Police Studies (TIPS), to amend the negative implications of his book. He held a press conference on June 15 and made an apology to the Turkish people.Handelman, Stephen, \\"Revisiting the land of 'Midnight Express'\\", Toronto Star, June 24, 2007 See also *List of fugitives from justice who disappeared ReferencesExternal links \\"Riding the Midnight Express with Billy Hayes\\" website 1947 births 20th-century American criminals American cannabis traffickers American escapees American memoirists American people imprisoned abroad Cannabis in Turkey Escapees from Turkish detention Living people People convicted of cannabis offenses Turkey–United States relations ","title":"Billy Hayes (writer)"},{"id":"1336034","text":"A heavy brigade is a formation made up from 'Heavy' Cavalry; i.e. Dragoon Guards and Dragoons.

The Andaman Islands, Nicobar Islands, and northwestern Sumatra are located on the plate. This island arc separates the Andaman Sea from the main Indian Ocean to the west. To its east lies the Sunda Plate, from which it is separated along a transform boundary, running in a rough north-south line through the Andaman Sea. This boundary between the Burma and Sunda plates is a marginal seafloor spreading centre, which has led to the opening up of the Andaman Sea (from a southerly direction) by \\"pushing out\\" the Andaman-Nicobar-Sumatra island arc from mainland Asia, a process which began in earnest approximately 4 million years ago. To the west is the much larger India Plate, which is subducting beneath the western facet of the Burma Plate. This extensive subduction zone has formed the Sunda Trench.  Tectonic history  In models of the reconstructed tectonic history of the area, the generally northwards movement of the Indo-Australian Plate resulted in its substantive collision with the Eurasian continent, which began during the Eocene epoch, approximately 50–55 million years ago (Ma). This collision with Asia began the orogenic uplift which has formed the Himalaya mountains, as well as the fracturing of the Indo-Australian plate into the modern Indian Plate, Australian Plate, and possibly Capricorn Plate. As the India Plate drifted northwards at a relatively rapid rate of an average 16 cm/yr, it also rotated in a counterclockwise direction. As a result of this movement and rotation, the convergence along the plate's eastern boundary (the Burma- Andaman-Malay region) with Eurasia was at an oblique angle. The transform forces along this subduction front started the clockwise bending of the Sunda arc; in the late Oligocene (ca. 32 Ma) further faulting developed and the Burma and Sunda microplates began to \\"break off\\" from the larger Eurasian Plate. After a further series of transform faulting, and the continuing subduction of the India Plate beneath the Burma Plate, backarc spreading saw the formation of the marginal basin and seafloor spreading centre which would become the Andaman Sea, a process well-underway by the mid-Pliocene (3–4 Ma). Western Sunda Arc and Trench showing tectonic and seismic activity.  Recent tectonic activity  On December 26, 2004, a large portion of the boundary between the Burma Plate and the Indian Plate slipped, causing the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. This megathrust earthquake had an estimated moment magnitude of 9.1–9.3 . Over 1600 km of the boundary underwent thrust faulting and shifted up to 5 meters vertically and 11 meters horizontally. This rapid rise in the sea floor over such a short time (seven minutes) generated a massive tsunami that killed approximately 229,800 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean.

Highway rest stops As of 2008, Virginia operated 42 rest stops and visitor centers along its interstate highways. In response to budget pressures, the Board sought public input and determined to reduce costs by closing 19 rest stops and expanding the truck parking lots at the remaining stops to accommodate the trucks that would other park and sleep at the stops designated for closing.http://www.virginiadot.org/news/resources/Statewide/19_SRAWC_Closures.pdf Retrieved 2010-04-27. The Board also removed the two-hour limit on truck parking. The closures began on July 21, 2009 The Board's funding options were limited, because Federal law 23 U.S.C. §111 prohibits commercialization of interstate highway rest stops. The closing resulted in a $9 million annual saving. At the Board's first meeting in January 2010, it reversed the decision to close the rest stops and reassigned $3 million in highway maintenance funds to keep the 19 rest stops open until the end of the fiscal year.

The American edition of the novel (also 1954) was published by the Viking Press, New York. It is set amidst the turbulence of the British withdrawal from India. It is notable for its portrayal of the Eurasian (Anglo-Indian) community, who were caught in their loyalties between the departing British and the majority Indian population. The Anglo-Indian characters in the novel, like many members of their community, are closely involved with the Indian railway system. Plot summary The book is set in 1946/1947, shortly before India gained independence. Victoria is an Anglo-Indian, the daughter of a railwayman. Patrick Taylor, also an Anglo-Indian, considers himself her boyfriend, but her feelings towards him have become ambivalent since her experience of British Army staff culture (see below). Taylor is represented as a clumsy and resentful personality, tormented by conflicting feelings of social inferiority and racial superiority. In vigorously defending herself from a British army officer who is attempting to rape her, Victoria unintentionally kills him. She is persuaded not to report the matter by a subordinate of Patrick's, a Sikh, Ranjit, who hopes to marry her and whose family and friends help her to avoid detection. Victoria had earlier decided to escape the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anglo-Indian community by becoming a Women's Auxiliary Corps (India) officer at army headquarters. With the war's end and her return home, however, she is confronted with the problem of her identity all over again. She decides to get engaged to the gentle and serious Ranjit in an attempt to become assimilated in wider Indian society—since British rule is visibly on its way out—but then she realises that such a marriage would require her to give up her name (and, essentially, her identity). She runs away from the Sikhs and literally into the arms of a veteran British officer, Rodney Savage (commander of a Gurkha battalion who \\"have come from the war, lots of wars\\"). Savage is, like John Masters, not only a professional soldier but also a member of a British family who have for generations served in India. Victoria originally dislikes Savage as hard and cruel but eventually becomes both his lover and his unofficial adjutant in the last hectic days of British rule in India. But in the end she realises that she cannot escape her origins, and—rejecting both the Indian man and the British one—chooses Patrick, an Anglo-Indian like herself. Rodney Savage recognises that he is losing out to his social and intellectual inferior, but realises that he is powerless to prevent it. Patrick for his part begins to realise that, in the new India, his children might have a chance of becoming anyone they want to, rather than having to stick to the Anglo-Indians' traditional role of working on the railways. Themes The central theme of the novel, epitomised by Victoria's own dilemma between her competing suitors, is the conflicting pressures upon the mixed-race Anglo-Indian community as Independence approaches, not confident of \\"fitting in\\" either in a Britain most of them have never seen, or in an independent India. Another important theme in the novel is the significance of the developing Cold War for post- colonial India. The British are resigned to leaving the country, but are desperate to have an influence on India's future, in particularly by averting the threat of a Communist takeover. The Royal Indian Navy Mutiny had been a stark reminder of Communist mutinies in the October Revolution and in post-World War I Germany. Throughout the book the British are shown striving to support and sustain the Congress Party and its leader Gandhi, who for so long they had vilified and imprisoned. In one passage the British character Rodney Savage reflects upon the irony of his being charged with protecting Gandhi against a terrorist assassination attempt. According to Masters, writing in the Glossary to his earlier novel, Nightrunners of Bengal, Bhowani is an \\"imaginary town. To get a geographical bearing on the story it should be imagined to be about where Jhansi really is - 25.27 N., 78.33 E.\\"Masters, John. Nightrunners of Bengal. (London and New York, 1951). Glossary. Series The book is one of a series of historical novels written by John Masters, set in India and involving several generations of the fictional Savage family. It has particular connections to Nightrunners of Bengal, the first novel Masters wrote in the series (though not the earliest in terms of its historical setting), which dealt with the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Both novels were set in Bhowani and its environs. Some locations, such as the Tree of the Silver Guru, appear in both novels (although the railway, which has a major role in Bhowani Junction, was in the earlier book a metalled road). In both books the protagonist is named Rodney Savage, and the WWII colonel is the direct descendant, almost a hundred years later, of the East India Company officer Rodney Savage from Nightrunners of Bengal. Savage returns in a sequel, To the Coral Strand, where he undergoes a deep personal crisis which ends with his staying on in independent India rather than returning to Britain, and coming to terms with the new reality.

Along its , 110-block route, Lexington Avenue runs through Harlem, Carnegie Hill, the Upper East Side, Midtown, and Murray Hill to a point of origin that is centered on Gramercy Park. South of Gramercy Park, the axis continues as Irving Place from 20th Street to East 14th Street. Lexington Avenue was not one of the streets included in the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 street grid, so the addresses for cross streets do not start at an even hundred number, as they do with avenues that were originally part of the plan. History View of Lexington Avenue south from 50th street, with the Chrysler Building in the background Both Lexington Avenue and Irving Place began in 1832 when Samuel Ruggles, a lawyer and real-estate developer, petitioned the New York State Legislature to approve the creation of a new north/south avenue between the existing Third and Fourth Avenues, between 14th and 30th Streets. Ruggles had purchased land in the area, and was developing it as a planned community of townhouses around a private park, which he called Gramercy Park. He was also developing property around the planned Union Square, and wanted the new road to improve the value of these tracts. The legislation was approved, and, as the owner of most of the land along the route of the new street, Ruggles was assessed for the majority of its cost. Ruggles named the southern section, below 20th Street, which opened in 1833, after his friend Washington Irving. The northern section, which opened three years later, in 1836, was named after the Battle of Lexington in the Revolutionary War.Harris, Gale and Shockley, Jay. \\"East 17th Street/Irving Place Historic District Designation Report\\" New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (June 30, 1988) Lexington saw the first arrest in New York for speeding, in 1899, when a bicycle patrolman overtook cabdriver Jacob German, who had been racing down the avenue at the \\"reckless\\" speed of .Lewis, Mary Beth. \\"Ten Best First Facts\\", in Car and Driver, 1/88, p. 92.

The widened street and the subway line both opened on July 17, 1918.Cunningham, Joseph and DeHart, Leonard: A History of the New York City Subway System, 1993. p. 51 Portions of the avenue were widened in 1955, which required eminent domain takings of the facades of some structures along Lexington. Lexington Avenue has carried one-way (downtown) traffic since July 17, 1960. The July 18, 2007 New York City steam explosion sent a geyser of hot steam up from beneath the avenue at 41st Street resulting in one death and more than 40 injuries. Description=Lexington Avenue Lexington Avenue runs one-way southbound for its entire length from 131st to 21st Streets. Parallel to Lexington Avenue lies Park Avenue to its west and Third Avenue to its east. The avenue is largely commercial at ground level, with offices above. There are clusters of hotels in the 30s and 40s, roughly from the avenue's intersection with 30th Street through to its intersection with 49th Street, and apartment buildings farther north. There are numerous structures designated as New York City Landmarks (NYCL), National Historic Landmarks (NHL), and National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on Lexington Avenue.

After the opening of Union Square in 1839, the Irving Place area became one of the most sought-after residential neighborhoods in the city, a situation which was only enhanced by the development of Gramercy Park to the north and Stuyvesant Square to the east. An assortment of restaurants and bars line Irving Place, including Pete's Tavern, New York's oldest surviving saloon, where O. Henry supposedly conceived of his short story \\"The Gift of the Magi\\", and which survived Prohibition disguised as a flower shop. Irving Plaza, on East 15th Street and Irving, hosts numerous concerts for both well-known and indie bands and draws a crowd almost every night. Another component of the avenue are the large apartment buildings which line the street from Gramercy Park to 17th Street. Also at 17th, a small bed-and-breakfast, the Inn at Irving Place, occupies two Greek Revival architecture townhouses built in 1840–1841 and renovated between 1991 and 1995. Historically and architecturally significant are 47 and 49 Irving Place—the latter where Washington Irving is said to have lived, but did not—which are part of the East 17th Street/Irving Place Historic District, and 19 Gramercy Park on the corner of 20th Street, part of the Gramercy Park Historic District. Offices located on Irving Place include those of The Nation magazine, the New York branch of the Rosicrucian Order and the Seafarers and International House mission.

Whilst she stands on a subway grating outside the Loew's Lexington theatre, her skirt billows up from the wind underneath. While the footage showing the theatre in the background appeared in the finished film, the footage featuring the subway grate shot on September 15, 1954, on the corner of Lexington Avenue and 51st Street was more of a publicity stunt; retakes were shot on a studio soundstage, and shots from both are seen in the film.\\"Marilyn\\" Essay by George S.

It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 (only released in Europe) and GameCube, based on the Ghost Recon game engine; another version was released for the Game Boy Advance. The game is based on the 2002 film of the same name. It is a tactical first-person shooter and is very similar in style to that of the Rainbow Six series of games. Plot A screenshot showing the PC version of the game. The game's first two missions take place sometime during the film, in which the FBI Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) works to save hostages in a Charleston, West Virginia television station, and shut down operations from a West Virginian militia calling themselves the \\"Mountain Men\\". From the third mission on, John Clark recruits the team to work for the CIA and has the operatives work on seeking out and killing the conspirators behind an incident in Baltimore, Maryland, in which a nuclear bomb has been detonated during an American football game, killing a large number of people. Gameplay The Sum of All Fears uses a simplified way of gameplay from the Rainbow Six series. There is no planning phase to each mission; instead the player's 3-man team executes a pre-planned insertion with other anti-terrorist teams controlled solely by the computer. However, the player is free to deviate from the planned route and select their own path. The player also cannot individually select the equipment each team member carries. Instead, the player chooses from a small selection of pre-defined equipment packages for the entire team. On each mission, the player has control of his two teammates, and can take direct control of any of them at any time. The player can also give a few rudimentary commands to his teammates, such as \\"wait here\\", \\"follow me\\", and \\"clear/grenade/flashbang the next room\\". Reception The Sum of All Fears sold 180,000 copies by September 30, 2002. By the end of 2002, its sales had surpassed 400,000 copies, although Ubisoft had projected sales of only 350,000 by March 2003. The PC and Game Boy Advance versions received \\"average\\" reviews, while the GameCube version received \\"unfavorable\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

It is a sequel to the 1985 film Re-Animator and the second entry in the Re-Animator film series. Like its predecessor, it is loosely based on the serialized story \\"Herbert West–Reanimator\\" by H. P. Lovecraft. The plot of Bride of Re-Animator roughly follows episodes \\"V. The Horror from the Shadows\\" and \\"VI. The Tomb- Legions\\" of the Lovecraft story, and follows doctors Herbert West and Dan Cain as they attempt to create a living woman from dead tissue. The film stars Bruce Abbott, Claude Earl Jones, Fabiana Udenio, David Gale, and Kathleen Kinmont, with Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West. It was followed by a sequel, Beyond Re-Animator, released in 2003. Plot Eight months after the events of Re-Animator, doctors Herbert West and Dan Cain are working as medics in the middle of a bloody Peruvian civil war. In the chaos of battle and with plenty of casualties to work on, they are free to experiment with West's re-animation reagent. When their medical tent is stormed by the enemy troops, West and Cain return home to Arkham, Massachusetts. There, they resume their former jobs as doctors at Miskatonic University Hospital, and West returns to the basement laboratory of Cain's house to continue his research. Using parts pilfered from both the hospital's morgue and from a cemetery located next door, West discovers that his reagent can re-animate body parts by themselves. He becomes determined to create an entire living person from disparate body parts. West discovers the heart of Megan Halsey, Cain's fiancée, in the hospital morgue. With the promise to use her heart to re-animate a new Megan, West convinces Cain to help him with his project. Also stored in the morgue is the rest of the evidence from the previous \\"Miskatonic Massacre\\". Inside, pathologist Dr. Wilbur Graves discovers a vial of West's reagent and the severed head of Dr. Carl Hill. Using the reagent, he re-animates Hill's head. Meanwhile, police officer Lt. Leslie Chapham begins investigating West and Cain. He bears a grudge against the pair, as they were the only unaffected survivors of the Miskatonic Massacre; the dead body of Chapham's wife was re-animated into a crazed zombie during the incident. Chapham suspects West and Cain were responsible. When he stops by their house to question them, he discovers West's corpse-filled lab and the two get into a confrontation. A fight ensues and West kills Chapham by means of cloth treated with a chemical which causes cardiac arrest when inhaled (a product of West's research into obtaining the freshest possible corpses for his experiments). West then re-animates the police officer with the intention of covering up his crime. Chapham violently wanders out of the house and into the cemetery next door. Hill, who bears a grudge against West, uses psychic powers to command Chapham to force Dr. Graves to stitch bat wings onto his neck, giving him back his mobility. He also extends his mental control to all of the zombie survivors of the Miskatonic Massacre. When one of Cain's patients, Gloria, dies, West collects the last piece he needs for his creation: her head. With a complete body stitched and wired together, West and Cain inject the re-animation reagent into Meg's heart. While waiting for the reagent to take effect, a package is delivered to their house. West retrieves and opens it. From inside, Hill's winged head flies out. Simultaneously, the zombies Hill controls break into the house. West retreats back to the basement lab, where his creation, the Bride, has awoken. A catfight breaks out between the Bride and Cain's current girlfriend, Italian journalist Francesca Danelli, whom he met in Peru. Cain rejects the Bride's love and sides with Francesca. Heart-broken, the Bride rips Megan's heart out of her own chest and then literally falls to pieces. West diagnoses this as tissue rejection. Hill and his zombies force West, Cain and Francesca to retreat through the wall of the lab and into a crypt in the neighboring cemetery. Inside, all of West's prior test subjects arise and make their way towards him, stopping only when Herbert commands them to. The unstable crypt begins to collapse, trapping Hill, West and the zombies. Cain and Francesca manage to escape the debris and claw their way to the surface of the cemetery together. Hill, stuck in the debris, laughs manically, while Megan's heart, still in the hand of the Bride, stops beating. Cast * Jeffrey Combs as Dr. Herbert West * Bruce Abbott as Dr. Dan Cain * Claude Earl Jones as Lt. Leslie Chapham * Fabiana Udenio as Francesca Danelli * David Gale as Dr. Carl Hill * Kathleen Kinmont as Gloria / The Bride * Mel Stewart as Dr. Wilbur Graves * Irene Forrest as Nurse Shelley * Michael Strasser as Ernest * Mary Sheldon as Meg Halsey * Friday as Angel The Re-Animated * Marge Turner as Elizabeth Chapham * Johnny Legend as Skinny Corpse * David Bynum as Black Corpse * Noble Craig as Crypt Creature * Kim Parker as Crypt Creature * Charles Schneider as Crypt Creature * Rebeca Recio as Crypt Creature * Jay Evans as Crypt Creature Production One idea for a sequel involved Dan Cain taking the job of a building superintendent to surreptitiously continue working on Meg Halsey's body at night. When government agents discover his whereabouts, they secret him away to the White House where he is reunited with Herbert West and instructed to reanimate the President of the United States. A similar idea was later used for the unproduced sequel House of Re-Animator. Pre-production on Bride of Re-Animator began in early 1989. Production on the film was scheduled to begin on June 5, 1989, which left the filmmakers with less than one month to finalize the script, finish hiring the cast and crew, and get the special effects underway.: \\"What everyone feared was announced this afternoon [May 16, 1989] in a meeting: Wild Street is staying with their production start date of June 5.\\" Jeffrey Combs was initially not going to reprise his role as Herbert West due to a scheduling conflict, as he was already booked to be in Italy for the filming of The Pit and the Pendulum. However, on May 25, 1989, production on The Pit and the Pendulum was pushed back, and Combs was immediately cast to return as West. Director Yuzna considered Patricia Tallman for the role of the Bride, but on May 28, 1989, he selected Kinmont to play the part. Actress Barbara Crampton, who starred in the first Re-Animator film, did not return for Bride of Re-Animator. A 1991 issue of Fangoria reported that Crampton declined to reprise her role due to soap opera obligations. In a 2011 interview, Crampton said that her agent convinced her not to make a cameo appearance in Bride of Re-Animator, as he felt that it was beneath her to have such a minor role. Principal photography began in June 1989 and wrapped the following month, on July 18. A scene in which Dr. Hill's head is found on exhibit at a carnival was shot in mid-June, but this sequence was not included in the finished film. Special effects Tony Doublin of Doublin FX created the special effects for the eye/finger creature, which involved the use of a rod puppet, a stop-motion puppet, and a stunt hand. Doublin also created the puppet used to portray Francesca's dog Angel after West reanimates its corpse and attaches a human arm to it. When not depicted with a puppet, Angel was played by dog actor Friday, who was cast after demonstrating that she could walk with a prosthetic arm. West's failed test subjects were designed by Japanese artist Screaming Mad George and his crew, while the effects for Dr. Hill's head were created by Mike Deak and Wayne Toth of John Carl Buechler's Magical Media Industries. The special effects for the Bride were created by KNB EFX Group, including Robert Kurtzman and Howard Berger. Greg Nicotero, who co-founded KNB EFX with Kurtzman and Berger, was working on the special effects for another film, Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers, during the pre-production of Bride of Re-Animator. However, Nicotero joined the Bride of Re-Animator crew in June 1989, and oversaw the effects during the filming of the sequence in which West and Cain are shown working as wartime medics in a field hospital.: \\"The medical camp sequence was a gorefest. I had several Mexican extras waiting to be guided down the hall to the KNB room to receive various wounds [...] Nicotero was in charge, and along with [Mike] Spatola, [Mark] Maitre and [Bill] Basso ground out incredible splatter FX at the drop of a hat.\\" Reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 40% based on 20 critics, with an average rating of 5.17/10. Variety recommended it to fans of the first film, but noted that the abundance of gore \\"will turn off\\" mainstream audiences. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that \\"Bride of Re-Animator is less a sequel to the critically praised 1985 horror film Re-Animator than a rehash based on the same H. P. Lovecraft stories.\\" Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly gave it a rating of \\"C+\\" and called it \\"an anemic shadow of the first film\\". Patrick Legare of AllMovie gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, writing that \\"Re-Animator was a tough act to follow, but Brian Yuzna does an admirable job of keeping with the splattery spirit of the original\\". In their book Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft, Andrew Migliore and John Strysik write: \\"Bride of Re-Animator is a silly film that is fun solely for the fevered performance of Jeffrey Combs. Unlike the original Re-Animator, Brides script really suffers from a lack of cohesiveness and undeterminable character motivation.\\" Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle called it \\"a pointless and forgettable sequel\\". Bride of Re-Animator was nominated for two awards by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films in 1991. It was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film and Jeffrey Combs was nominated for Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sequel Bride of Re-Animator was followed by Beyond Re-Animator in 2003.

The Harpy has been sold to several foreign nations, including South Korea, Turkey, India, and China. History In 2004, the Harpy became the focus of the effort by the United States to restrict arms transfers and the sales of advanced military technology to China. Sold to China in 1994 for around US$55 million, the loitering munitions were returned to Israel in 2004 under contract to be upgraded. The United States, fearing that the Harpy would pose a threat to Taiwanese and American forces in the case of a war with China, demanded that Israel seize the loitering munitions and nullify the contract. According to Israel, the Harpy is an indigenously designed loitering munitions. It does not contain any US-produced sub-systems. In 2005, the loitering munitions were returned to China without being upgraded.

Like most large aircraft of the era, it used radial engines—in this case, the Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major. The aircraft was designed with maximum aerodynamic efficiency in mind. The XF-12 was referred to as an aircraft that was \\"flying on all fours\\" meaning: four engines, 400 mph cruise, 4,000 mile range, at 40,000 feet.Marrett 2005, p. 23. It is still the fastest piston-engined airplane of this size, exceeding by some 50 mph the Boeing XB-39 of 1944.Sitaras 1998 Although highly innovative, the postwar XF-12 Rainbow was made obsolete by modern jet engine technology, and did not enter production. Development The original proposal for the aircraft, delivered in late 1943, came from the USAAC Air Technical Service Command, stationed at Wright Field. The proposal was for a reconnaissance aircraft which included a requirement for speed (400 mph), ceiling (40,000 ft), and range (4,000 nmi). Its primary objective was for high-speed overflights of the Japanese homeland and key enemy installations. During World War II, due to the extended range requirements of operating in the Pacific, existing fighters and bombers were being used for missions for which they were never intended. The need existed for an aircraft specifically designed for the photo-reconnaissance mission. The aircraft required adequate speed, range, and altitude capabilities for its missions to be successful. In August 1943, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's son, Colonel Elliot Roosevelt, commander of the F-5 (modified P-38) \\"recon\\" unit, recommended the acquisition of a dedicated high- performance photo reconnaissance aircraft, capable of providing pre-strike target acquisition and photo interpretation. Followed by additional overflights to provide post-strike analysis of their subsequent destruction, this would give commanders the ability to make pivotal strategic decisions and set up subsequent raids. The XF-12 was Republic Aviation's attempt to meet those goals. Its primary competition during this time was the Hughes XF-11. Both were introduced at the same time, and both were powered by the new P&W; R-4360. The XF-12's first flight was made on 4 February 1946. During the XF-12's subsequent flight testing and development period, it demonstrated the capability of operating at , at a speed of , over a range of , so it met and exceeded the design goals for which it had been designed. Neither the XF-11 nor the XF-12 was purchased in any quantity by the U.S. Army Air Forces (two each), as their need evaporated after hostilities ended in World War II.Machat 1994, p. 12. When the XF-12 was modified with increased \\"all weather\\" equipment and outfitted with its new engines capable of providing short bursts of extra power, it suddenly assumed tremendous importance in the eyes of both the U.S. Air Force and the State Department. As a potent intelligence weapon, the XF-12 had the ability to obtain photographs both in daylight and under conditions of restricted visibility at high altitudes over long ranges and with great speed. In theory, operating from northern bases (Alaska and Canada), this \\"flying photo laboratory\\" was capable of mapping broad stretches of territory in the Arctic regions performing reconnaissance with near- invulnerability.Aviation Week, 10 November 1947 Design XF-12 Rainbow c. 1946 Low drag was a primary consideration throughout the design of the XF-12. Many of its features were taken directly from Republic's considerable experience with fighter plane design. In an extremely rare case of design direction, absolutely no compromise with aerodynamics was made in the shape of its fuselage. Aviation Week was quoted as saying \\"the sharp nose and cylindrical cigar shape of the XF-12 fulfills a designer's dream of a no compromise design with aerodynamic considerations.\\" To fulfill its reconnaissance role, the XF-12 contained three separate photographic compartments aft of the wing. One vertical, one split vertical, and one trimetrogon each using a six-inch Fairchild K-17 camera. For night reconnaissance missions, the XF-12 had a large hold in the belly which accommodated 18 high-intensity photo-flash bombs; these were ejected over the target area. All of the bays were equipped with electrically operated, inward retracting doors (again designed for minimum aerodynamic drag). The camera lenses were electrically heated to eliminate distortion. All of this combined to allow full photo operations during high speed flights. The XF-12 also carried a variety of photographic equipment, including complete darkroom facilities to permit the development and printing of films in flight. This was augmented by adjustable storage racks, able to handle any size film containers and additional photo equipment. This allowed the Army Intelligence units to have immediate access to the intelligence the aircraft was able to collect, with no delay in processing.Machat 1994, p. 16. The Rainbow featured a wing of straight taper with squared tips and high aspect ratio for maximum efficiency. The engines featured a sliding cowl arrangement to facilitate cooling airflow instead of the normal cowl flaps, which caused too much drag. At the front of the cowls, the engines were also fitted with a two-stage \\"impeller fan\\" directly behind the propeller hub and prop spinner. This allowed the engines to be tightly cowled for aerodynamic efficiency, but still provide the cooling airflow the engines required. When the sliding cowl ring was closed (during flight), the air used for cooling the engine was ducted through the nacelle to the rear exhaust orifice for a net thrust gain, as opposed to the usual cooling drag penalty. All of the air for the engine intakes, oil coolers and intercoolers was drawn through the front of each wing between the inboard and outboard engines. This allowed less drag than with individual intakes for each component. In addition, because the air was taken from a high-pressure area at the front of the wing, this provided a \\"ram air\\" benefit for increased power at high speeds, and more effective cooling of the oil and intercoolers. The intake portion of the wing comprised 25% of the total wingspan. They were extensively wind tunnel tested for intake efficiency and inlet contour efficiency. This cooling air, after being utilized, was ducted toward the rear of the nacelle, to provide additional net thrust. The entire engine nacelle was the length of a P-47 Thunderbolt (also built by Republic). Each engine featured twin General Electric turbochargers, situated at the aft end of the nacelle. All of the exhaust from the P&W; R-4360 was ducted straight out of the back of the nacelles. This provided additional thrust. Research showed that roughly 250 equivalent horsepower was generated by each engine exhaust during high speed cruise at 40,000 ft.Machat 1994, p. 14. The original design of the XF-12 called for contra-rotating propellers, similar to those used on the original XF-11. However, due to the added complexity and reliability issues, the propellers were never installed. They would have been twin three- bladed propellers (rotating in opposite directions). As it was, the aircraft used standard four-bladed Curtiss Electric propellers for all flights.Machat 1994, p. 10. Operational history The first prototype was damaged in landing on 10 July 1947. The aircraft was undergoing maximum landing weight tests. During one particularly hard landing, the right main gear was severed at the engine nacelle. The aircraft bounced hard, and staggered back into the air. The test pilot was able to maintain control, and climb to a safe altitude. He continued to fly the aircraft to burn off excess fuel, to both make the aircraft lighter and lessen the chance of fire. Once excess fuel was burned off, the pilot landed on the left main gear and the nose wheel. The pilot touched down, and while keeping the right wing up, scrubbed off as much speed as possible before it touched down. During the incident the aircraft suffered significant damage. The right wing spar was cracked, and the #3 and #4 engines and props needed to be replaced due to the ground contact. The aircraft was repaired by Republic, and later returned to service.Machat 1994, p. 50. The only external difference between the first and second prototypes was the addition of cooling gills on the upper engine cowlings. Internally, the second prototype was far more \\"finished.\\" This included its full operational reconnaissance equipment suite, to allow for further testing. The XF-12 was later re-designated XR-12, when the U.S. Army Air Forces separated from the Army and became the U.S. Air Force. The most successful part of the XF-12 flight history is \\"Operation Birds Eye.\\" The mission was conceived to demonstrate the newly designated XF-12's ultimate photo capabilities. On 1 September 1948, the second prototype XF-12 departed U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center at Muroc, California, and climbed westward to gain altitude over the Pacific Ocean. Upon reaching its 40,000 ft cruising altitude, the XF-12 headed eastward and began photographing its entire flight path over the United States. The crew shot a continuous 325 foot-long strip of film composed of 390 individual photos (10 inches per photo) covering a 490-mile-wide field of vision. The aircraft landed at Mitchel Field at Garden City, Long Island, New York, completing a flight lasting six hours and 55 minutes at 361 mph average speed (approx. 1m4s per photo). The record-shattering flight was featured in the 29 November 1948 issue of Life magazine and the actual filmstrip went on exhibit at the 1948 U.S. Air Force Association Convention in New York. At the time this record flight was made, the U.S. Air Force had already canceled the entire XF-12 program. The primary reason for its demise was the availability of both Boeing B-29 Superfortress and B-50 types to meet the long-range photo- reconnaissance requirement until the far more capable Boeing RB-47 Stratojet was brought into service. The B-29 and B-50 gave the U.S. Air Force less costly \\"off the shelf\\" options.Marrett 2005, p. 26. Republic had intended to also build an airline version of the aircraft to be known as the RC-2. This variant was supposed to be a \\"stretched\\" version of the XF-12, growing in length from 93 ft 9 in to 98 ft 9 in, with the addition of a fuselage \\"plug\\" in front of the wing. Also the complex Plexiglas nose section was supposed to be replaced with a solid metal nose with a bifurcated windshield. Fuel capacity would have been increased, and more powerful (at lower altitude) P&W; R-4360-59s would have been substituted in place of the P&W; R-4360-31s on the U.S. Air Force version. The engines also would have only had one General Electric turbosupercharger each, instead of the dual arrangement on the U.S. Air Force model. The aircraft would be lavishly appointed for the 46 passengers and seven crew. It would have been fully pressurized to sea level, air conditioned, with an electric galley providing hot meals and with an inflight lounge. It would have had the ability to cruise above the weather at 435 mph at 40,000 feet. No versions of this aircraft were ever built.Machat 1994, p. 51. Without an order from the U.S. Air Force to offset the cost for development and tooling, the cost of building the civilian airliners went up exponentially. As a result, the two airlines (American Airlines and Pan-Am) that had originally placed tentative purchase orders, both cancelled due to the additional unit cost. Economically, the RC-2 wasn't as feasible as other designs available at the time, such as the Lockheed Constellation and the Douglas DC-6. Both of those aircraft could carry more people, at a lower cost per mile. In addition, after the hostilities ended in World War II, there were large collections of surplus military transports available for purchase, such as the Douglas C-54 Skymaster. These former transport aircraft lent themselves to be readily converted to airline service at a fraction of the cost of buying new aircraft. Without additional orders, Republic cancelled all further plans to build not only the XF-12 but also the RC-2, leaving just the two original prototypes. On 7 November 1948, prototype number two, 44-91003, crashed at 13:00 while returning to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. The number 2 (port inner) engine exploded as the aircraft was returning from a photographic suitability test flight. The pilot was unable to maintain control due to violent buffeting, and he ordered the crew to bail out. Five of the seven crew escaped safely, including pilot Lynn Hendrix, rescued by Eglin crash boats and helicopters. The airframe impacted two miles south of the base in the Choctawhatchee Bay. Sgt. Vernon B. Palmer and M/Sgt. Victor C. Riberdy were killed.\\"Seven Airmen Dead in Eglin Plane Crashes\\". Playground News, Fort Walton, Florida, 11 November 1948, Volume 3, Number 41, p. 1. The first prototype, which returned to service in 1948, continued the flight testing and development phase. After the U.S. Air Force declined to order any additional aircraft, and with the loss of the second prototype, the flight testing period wound down. In June 1952, the first prototype, 44-91002, was retired (having flown just 117 additional hours from 1949–1952), was stricken from the U.S. Air Force inventory, and ended up as a target on the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.Machat 1994, pp. 50–51. Had the XF-12 Rainbow been available in 1944, it almost inevitably would have been ordered in quantity, and along with its civilian counterpart, the whole postwar structure of aircraft markets might have been altered. As it was, the XF-12 disappeared into oblivion, despite its graceful lines and high performance. According to Machat, the Rainbow remains the ultimate expression of multi-engine, piston-powered aircraft design. Its high speed, near-perfect streamlined form, and neatly cowled engines make it a design classic, often unappreciated, and not very well known. The XF-12 was the fastest, four engine pure piston-powered aircraft of its day, and the only one ever to exceed 450 mph in level flight.Machat 1994, p. 9. The closest the USAF ever got to the Rainbow, the 44 (converted from bombers) Boeing RB-50Bs, could only reach 385 mph at 25,000 feet with exactly the same engines (Wasp Majors).

It is the third and final installment in the Re-Animator film series. An international co- production of Spain and the United States, Beyond Re-Animator premiered on the Sci-Fi Channel, though it was produced independently and acquired by the channel only as a distributor; this showing was cut to a TV-PG rating. The film received a limited theatrical run in the U.S. and was assigned an R rating, though a slightly longer unrated cut is available on home media in some countries. Plot For the past 13 years, Dr. Herbert West has been serving a prison sentence due to a murder at the hands of one of his zombies. With what scant supplies he has on hand in the prison medical center, Dr. West has been capable of performing only extremely basic experiments on rats. However, his lack of supplies does not prevent him from uncovering a key element in his re-animation process. Dr. West has discovered \\"NPE\\" (Nano- Plasmic Energy), an energy that can be extracted from the brain of a living organism through an electrocution-like process, to be stored in a capsule resembling a small light bulb. The capsule can then be connected to a corpse and used in conjunction with West's previously developed reagent to restore the former dead to a lifelike state. The NPE prevents the degeneration seen in previous instances, where the reanimated are nothing more than mindless zombies. Used together with the re-agent, reanimated corpses regain their skills, memories, and motor functions and nearly fully resemble normal humans. When a young doctor named Howard Phillips comes to work at the prison, West is assigned to assist the new doctor. Due to Phillips' interest with Dr. West's research, West is able to attain the supplies and tools needed to bring his experiments to the next level. It is revealed that Phillips is the younger brother of the teenage girl who was killed by West's zombie (he is shown watching West being taken away by the cops) and came to the prison for the explicit purpose of working with him. Despite his interest, Phillips still maintains an ethical reluctance to allow West's research to full completion. In the meantime, journalist Laura Olney, covering a story for her newspaper at the prison, meets and begins an affair with Dr. Phillips, and they fall in love. This new romance only temporarily postpones West's experiment, however. After the warden of the prison, also infatuated with Laura, attempts to seduce Laura himself, she resists and he angrily kills her. Crushed by Laura's death, Dr. Phillips succumbs to Dr. West's wishes and his experiments are allowed to literally take on new life. West & Phillips revive Laura with the NPE, although it is quickly seen that the dangerous side effects of West's past work are still present with the NPE. Eventually the warden of the prison uncovers West's experiments and moves to put an end to them, but he is killed by West, and subsequently re-animated. West uses the NPE from a prisoner's pet rat, causing some unexpected side effects in the warden's behavior. It quickly manifests itself as the prison descends into utter chaos as a riot breaks out, with vials of the reagent circulating through the population. Soon, it is unclear who is dead, who is alive, and who has been exposed to the agent. When the chaos finally settles from the bloody prison riot, West escapes captivity before the guards appear by stealing Phillips' I.D. when he comes across Phillips weeping over Laura's decapitated body. As police and authorities take control of the prison, Phillips is dragged away as he and Laura's head start laughing. Herbert West is shown putting on his glasses outside the prison, and disappears into the night to continue his research.

Allmovie gave the film a mixed review, calling it \\"almost a remake of the original\\". Jonathan Holland of Variety writes that the film is \\"sometimes shocking but rarely scary\\" and \\"calculated to appeal only to hardcore gore hounds.\\" In a mixed review, Patrick Naugle of DVD Verdict called it \\"somewhat of a letdown\\" but \\"worth at least one viewing\\". Writing for Bloody Disgusting, Brad Miska rates the film 2.5/5 stars and called it \\"a fun movie, but nothing special\\". In their book Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft, Andrew Migliore and John Strysik write: \\"If your idea of Lovecraftian fun is Combs' acidic one-liners, and digitally enhanced gore effects that weren't available for the other two films, then by all means have a look. But if you're comparing this film to the still classic Re-Animator, well... This third try is only a shadow of the gonzo wit of the original and not nearly as entertaining.\\" Zombiemania: 80 Movies to Die For author Arnold T. Blumberg wrote that \\"Beyond Re-Animator is better than its immediate predecessor\\" and that \\"Combs slips back into the white shirt and black tie, wielding the hypo of green goo like he never put it down, but his performance is nicely tempered by the passage of time, giving us a West that lacks some of his youthful confidence but none of his single-minded desire to pursue 'The Work.'\\" Home media In 2011 Arrow Video released a Special Edition DVD of the film, with the following special features: * Audio commentary with director Brian Yuzna * 'All in the Head' Brian Yuzna on the Re-Animator Chronicles (50 mins) * Original trailer * Reversible cover sleeve with original and newly commissioned artwork by Tom Hodge 'The Dude Designs' * Double-sided fold-out poster featuring new artwork * Collector's booklet featuring 'World of Lovecraft' and an interview with star Jeffrey Combs by author and critic Calum Waddell, as well as an extract from H.

He is best known for being co-founder and guitarist of the rock band, Incubus, and has also co-written, produced and collaborated with a wide array of artists including Pharrell Williams, Hans Zimmer, Skrillex, Tyler the Creator, Avicii, Damian Marley, Jason Schwartzman (Coconut Records) and Steve Martin among many others. Incubus has sold over 23 Million albums worldwide and in 2013, Einziger co-wrote the globally ubiquitous song Wake Me Up, alongside Avicii and Aloe Blacc. As a serial entrepreneur, Einziger is the Co- Founder & Co-Chairman of wireless technology platform, MIXhalo, and also the Co-Founder & CEO of biotechnology startup, Versicolor Technologies. Einziger received his education at Harvard University. Career=Incubus Einziger co-founded Incubus with Calabasas High School classmates Brandon Boyd, Jose Pasillas II, and Alex Katunich in 1991. Incubus has sold over 23 million albums worldwide and has been nominated for 2 Grammys, MTV music video awards, American Music Awards, mtv U Woodie Award, and the Billboard Awards. Incubus has performed sold-out concerts at The Hollywood Bowl, The Great Western Forum, Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, Wembley Arena in London, and Araneta Coliseum in Manila, Philippines. Solo work and current projects Outside of his work with Incubus, Einziger founded his own project Time Lapse Consortium in 2003. The group featured Incubus musicians Jose Pasillas II and Ben Kenney (who was not a member of Incubus at the time), Neal Evans of the band Soulive, and long-time collaborator Suzie Katayama contributing string arrangements. The band had their debut show at The Roxy in LA, and would go on to play Jimmy Kimmel and the Knitting Factory in New York City. In 2003 Einziger contributed to Ziggy Marley's debut solo album Dragonfly alongside fellow Incubus member Chris Kilmore as well as Flea and John Frusciante of Red Hot Chili Peppers. Einziger composed the soundtrack for the 2001 film Sol Goode, which was released later in 2003. Einziger also expanded into the realm of video games when he and his bandmates worked on the soundtrack of the popular game Halo 2, writing a 26-minute song that also featured Flea on trumpet. In 2006 Einziger produced the debut album \\"Red Rover\\" by Agent Sparks; a collaboration with younger brothers Benjamin Einziger and Paul Fried. In 2007, Einziger produced Nighttiming, the debut album of long-time friend and former Phantom Planet drummer and actor Jason Schwartzman's Coconut Records project. The album featured appearances by Kirsten Dunst, Zooey Deschanel, and Robert Schwartzman, and was recorded at Einziger's own home studio in Malibu, CA (Casa Chica). = End.>vacuum = Einziger began crafting an orchestral composition “End.>vacuum” following surgery in March 2007 for Carpal tunnel syndrome, a repetitive-strain injury to his left wrist undoubtedly due to a lifetime of playing guitar. The condition forced him to take a hiatus from the band and his instrument. It would be the longest he had ever gone without playing, and enabled him to follow some other musical, as well as outside, interests. The piece consisted of nine musical movements (approximately 40 minutes total) and was performed by a chamber orchestra led by renowned Los Angeles conductor and Einziger's longtime collaborator Suzie Katayama. Inspiration has been attributed to such iconoclastic modern and avant-garde composers as Igor Stravinsky, George Antheil, George Crumb, Samuel Barber, Krzysztof Penderecki and Frank Zappa. According to Einziger, “End.>vacuum” makes reference to his perception of the outer edge of human understanding, “the finite place where rational scientific knowledge stops and pure speculation ensues…The event horizon between what we know and what we don’t know is what keeps me awake at night, but also gets me out of bed every day.” “Einziger's work plays with time.” Los Angeles Times’ Steve Hochman proclaimed, “Pulsating tribal/mechanical rhythms melt into sustained, almost static stretches before the rhythm reemerges. The early-'80s large ensemble work of John Adams comes to mind, but the character of the piece is Einziger's own.” End.>vacuum was Einziger's first original orchestral composition. It debuted at UCLA’s famed Royce Hall on August 23, 2008. = Forced Curvature of Reflective Surfaces = On Saturday, November 21, 2009, Einziger participated in the premiere event of the West Coast, Left Coast festival titled \\"EUREKA!\\". Einziger performed his latest musical endeavour, a piece called \\"Forced Curvature of Reflective Surfaces\\". Forced Curvature was inspired by a combination of the physical appearance of the Frank Gehry- designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, and Einziger's studies in the field of quantum mechanics. The music was written for 12 electric guitars (played with a slide), 12 strings (violin, cello), and is based on the glissando. The instruments have been orchestrated in terms of corresponding high and low registers, that reflect each other as though being viewed through a mirror. The exterior shape of Disney Hall informed the shape of the sounds created and by necessity, was first drawn visually in the form of architectural-like renderings, before being committed to paper in the form of a hand-written score. \\"[Disney Hall] is obviously a solid, immobile structure, but it looks like a series of reflective waves that have been frozen in a specific state at a specific place in time, and I wanted to try and imagine what it might sound like if that idea were to be expressed as waves of sound. Adding a 4th dimension of time to the picture would force the structure into a Minkowskian space-time manifold, and it would therefore become directional. It would be as though time itself were forcing the curvature of the reflective material in a forward-motion, because time appears to be directional.\\" The piece has no apparent formal structure and has been through-composed. All of the instruments will be fused together, forming 2 distinct 'mirror images'. The strings and guitars combined will not sound like separate groups of instruments, but rather as dense units of a single instrument uncharacteristic of entirely one or the other. Einziger conceived of the piece at Harvard University where he was a student 2008–2011. = Harvard and studies = Einziger has studied the history and philosophy of physics with physicist/historian, Dr. Peter Galison, of Harvard University. He has a profound interest in the physical sciences. In 2008 he contributed to an article on the topic of human evolution with evolutionary biology figure and Brown University professor Dr. Kenneth Miller. On June 17, 2008 Einziger took a personal tour of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland with British physicist Dr. Brian Cox. During that visit, Einziger invited Dr. Cox to appear as a speaker at his concert for \\"End.>vacuum\\" later that Fall. = Other recent works = In 2009, Einziger orchestrated and recorded the additional strings for the Thirty Seconds to Mars third album This Is War. In 2012 Einziger began working with progressive house artist Avicii on the EDM producer's song \\"Wake Me Up!\\" for his debut studio album True. Einziger helped premiere the song live at Ultra 15 along with bandmates Jose Pasillas, Ben Kenney and country music legend Mac Davis. As of July 2013, the song reached No. 1 on the charts in 39 countries. Einziger also worked on music for The Amazing Spider-Man 2 with Hans Zimmer, Pharrell Williams, Johnny Marr and David A. Stewart. Musical influences Mike has cited his early guitar influences as Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix, John Frusciante, Steve Vai, Paul Fried and Frank Zappa. He claims \\"infatuation\\" with Björk's voice. Mike was also heavily influenced by the music of Black Sabbath and Metallica. Mike said that some of the music he was most proud of was the music he had worked on with Avicii. Personal life Einziger was born in Los Angeles, California. He is of Jewish descent.http://www.jewishjournal.com/arts/article/q_a_with_mike_einziger_of_incubus_20040813 Beginning in 2008, Mike was enrolled as a special student studying music theory at Harvard University. In August 2017, Mike welcomed his first children, twin girls Penelope and Telulah, with wife Ann-Marie Calhoun. Equipment Early on, Mike was playing Ibanez guitars, and sometime around the making of Enjoy Incubus he switched to PRS (Custom 24's). On the albums \\"Science\\" and \\"Make Yourself\\" he used a Mesa Boogie Tremoverb. Mike used PRS McCarty Archtop guitars while recording some songs on the album Make Yourself (for example the song \\"Make Yourself\\"). On the album Morning View, Mike only used his PRS McCarty Archtops. During the A Crow Left of the Murder... tour, he started playing Fender Jazzmaster guitars. This guitar is played most prominently on the Alive at Red Rocks DVD. On a recent tour he has been seen using a Gibson SG Junior with P-90's modified with an extra neck pickup and a pickup selector switch. In 2012 Mike switched to Music Man Albert Lee sig. guitars and began running lighter strings(down to 9's after running 13's for many years) because of his need to find a more \\"comfortable\\" guitar for touring. He's stated this has been necessary since developing, and having surgery for, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Einziger is a multi-instrumentalist, and in addition to guitar, he has played piano, Mellotron, pipa, analog synthesizers, Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer, and many other instruments on his recordings with Incubus as well as his other projects. He has also played a Jerry Jones Guitars Master Sitar on \\"Nowhere Fast\\" from the Make Yourself album (live, he simply plays the sitar part with his guitar), and a Pipa on \\"Aqueous Transmission\\". Mike also plays electric piano on songs like \\"Here In My Room\\" and has played piano on live versions of \\"Drive.\\" He commonly uses Mesa/Boogie Trem-O-Verb 2/12 Combos, Fender Twin Reverb. Uses Electro-Harmonix Micro POG Polyphonic Octave Generator for the solo section on “Promises, Promises.” On title track, “If Not Now, When?” Einziger plays a Mellotron mandolin. Has a 1930s Gibson with a smaller body and used an older Martin acoustic when recording “Defiance.” In the video for “Adolescents.” he is seen with a custom PRS guitar which was sold at a charity auction for $15,000 and was borrowed from the buyer for the video shoot. Stopped using PRS guitars after some issues arose with a particular employee of Paul Reed Smith. A detailed gear diagram of Mike Einziger's 2000 Incubus guitar rig is well- documented.

He was the last communist Prime Minister of Bulgaria. Biography=Early life Lukanov was born in Moscow, USSR, in the family of Karlo Lukanov, (1897-1982), a Bulgarian communist émigré. Lukanov's family moved back to Bulgaria after the communist takeover of 1944 when Lukanov was only 6 years old. Go to time: 6:52 (Bulgarian) His father became an important figure in the party and served as foreign minister of Bulgaria from 1956 to 1961. Political career Andrey became a member of the party in 1963 and began a career in the foreign service. He helped represent Bulgaria in the United Nations and Comecon. He rose through the ranks of the foreign service to become minister of foreign economic affairs in 1987, resigning in 1989. Lukanov became a leading member of the reformist wing of the BCP, and took part in the overthrow of longtime leader Todor Zhivkov. He became prime minister on February 3, 1990. This office he held until December 7, 1990. Midway through his tenure, the Communist Party rebranded itself as the Bulgarian Socialist Party. Lukanov oversaw the first democratic election which had taken place in Bulgaria since 1931. This election took place in June; the BSP remained the largest party in the national legislature, and Lukanov himself continued in government. Seeking a stable majority, Lukanov offered to form a coalition with the opposition, but his offers were rebuffed. The opposition argued that the former Communist Party must shoulder responsibility for past political crimes and the rapidly deteriorating economy. Lukanov's months in office were marked by corruption , huge consumer goods deficit, and civil unrest. Finally in December, after large demonstrations and a general strike, Lukanov resigned, allowing a technocratic government to be formed by Dimitar Popov.Randall W. Stone, Lending Credibility: The International Monetary Fund and the Post-Communist Transition, Princeton University Press, 2002, p. 210 Lukanov was charged with embezzlement in 1992 and arrested, but charges were soon dropped. During his time in the foreign service, Lukanov had gained connections with western businessmen such as Robert Maxwell and engaged in controversial business dealings. He is also sometimes held responsible for Bulgaria's foreign debt. Lukanov remained an active political participant in the BSP until his death. In 1995, he began criticizing various members of the party who, he believed, were not reformist enough and or had Stalinist tendencies. Assassination Lukanov was assassinated on 2 October 1996, оutside the Sofia apartment where he lived. He was shot in the head and chest by a lone gunman who fled and was never captured. A building contractor named Angel Vassilev, who had been close to the incumbent BSP government led by Zhan Videnov, was arrested and charged (alongside various others) with having organized Lukanov's murder. After a long trial and an initial guilty verdict, the Bulgarian Court of Appeal declared Vassilev and the other defendants to be innocent. Public rumors to the effect that Lukanov would be slain had been in existence for months before the killing was carried out. To this day, the true perpetrators of the assassination remain unknown.

Its aim is to organize the rescue resources to cope with the concentrated casualties. It was formerly called red plan (, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\); \\"Orsec\\" stands for \\"rescue management\\" (organisation des secours), and \\"novi\\" for \\"multiple casualties\\" (nombreuses victimes). It is different from the French white plan (), which is designed to face a sudden and unpredicted rise of the activity of a hospital. Since 2007, it is part from the Orsec plan (), which is generally designed to face insufficient emergency resources. In a Novi plan, the emergency resources are sufficient. The difficulty is coordinating them. The white plan is often launched along with the Novi plan in order to face the massive arrival of casualties evacuated by the Novi plan. The Novi plan is based on four concepts: * The resources should be rationally organized: The resources should not hamper each other, or deplete resources needed by another emergency. This implies coordination of the different forces (firefighters, samu/emergency medical service, police), and assignment of roles (hierarchical sorting); * There should be two chains of rescue, one focused on managing the site, the other focused on caring for the casualties; * A field hospital (or advanced medical post) should be installed next to the casualties, to perform triage and stabilisation before the evacuation; * There should be two commands, one on-site that deals with the management of the rescue operations, the other in a remote site (usually the préfecture) that deals with the reinforcement, the logistics... History The \\"plan rouge\\" was created in 1978 by the fire brigade of Paris (Brigade des sapeurs-pompiers de Paris, BSPP), after explosions during an urban fire (rue Raynouard, Paris 16e), that resulted in 13 dead and a great number of casualties. The name \\"red plan\\" refers to the traditional color of the French firefighters, and to the color of danger (blood/fire). It was then extended to the whole French territory by 28 October 1986 the circulaire (ministerial instruction) #86-318 (ministry of Interior/French Home Office). The red plan is defined by each département and thus can slightly vary from a dépertement to the other, but all the red plans are very similar. Following the 2004 Madrid train bombings and the 7 July 2005 London bombings, the French authorities considere the possibility of several simultaneous terrorist acts and create the \\"plan rouge alpha\\" (alpha red plan). It is implemented for the first time for the November 2015 Paris attacks. Since 2007, the plan rouge is a specific case of the plan Orsec. Activation The Novi plan is started in case of a disaster with limited consequences (accident catastrophique à effet limité, acel), when there are – or when there might be – numerous casualties. This plan is started by the préfet of the département (or, in case of Paris and its suburbs, by the préfet de police of Paris). These situations are various: * fire of great intensity with immediate risks for the population * building collapse * road accident, train accident, or airplane accident * criminal act (collective aggression by firearm, explosives, hostage-taking, terrorist attack...) * industrial injury * natural disaster The prerequisite for a Novi plan is a great number of casualties. This estimation can vary from département to département. In Paris, the following rules apply: :the situation involves a field hospital, and at least 15 persons must be evacuated to a hospital. :The notion of \\"number of casualties\\" is different depending on the situation, and is evaluated from the initial assessment (the Novi plan must be started quickly, i.e. before all the casualties are counted): :* for a fire, the number of casualties in the initial assessment is multiplied by 2: i.e. when the rescuers arrive, and count 6 to 8 casualties, there are usually about 15 casualties by the end of the operation;. :* for a terrorist bombing, the multiplication factor is 3, sometimes 4 or 5; :* for the other accidents, amongst which the public transport accident, the factor is 3 to 4. :In some specific situations, the risks (risk of explosion, of intoxication etc.), or the organizational constraints can lead to a Novi plan although there are only few casualties. General concept In case of a Novi plan, it is necessary to simultaneously: * fight the initial disaster and its direct and indirect consequences; * extract the casualties from the hostile environment; * care for the casualties. Due to the complexity of these three missions, two command chains are formed, under the authority of the \\"commander of the rescue operations\\" (COS: commandant des opérations de secours) : the fire-and-rescue chain, and the medical chain: * the fire-and-rescue chain has the charge to fight the initial disaster; the rescuers are entirely devoted to this task, and participate to the search and rescue, locating the casualties, extraction/extrication of the casualties and possibly perform first aid onsite; * the medical chain has three functions: ** the first aid onsite, casualty lifting (scoop) and movement from the disaster location to the field hospital (called \\"advanced medical post\\", or PMA: poste médical avancé); ** triage and stabilising the casualties for the evacuation; ** the evacuation of the casualties to adapted care structures (hospitals). Distribution of the responsibilities Command structure during an Orsec-Novi plan (red plan). The préfet of the département (or the préfet de police for Paris and its suburbs) is the director of rescue operations (DOS: directeur des opérations de secours). He starts the Novi plan; usually, the Novi plan is started by the firefighter or medical dispatch and then officialized by the préfet. The chief officer of the local fire and rescue department (SDIS: service départemental d'incendie et de secours) is the \\"commander of the rescue operations\\" (COS: commandant des opérations de secours). He is assisted by the \\"director of fire and rescue\\" (DSIS: directeur des secours incendie et sauvetage), and by the \\"director of medical rescue\\" (DSM: directeur des secours médicaux). The DSM is usually the chief-physician of the firefighters or the director of samu (French EMS). The main resources are the firefighters and Samu, but other organisations can contribute, such as the first aid associations (e.g. French Red Cross, volunteers of the civil protection/FNPC), who can contribute to the non-medical evacuations or deal with the relative emergencies, light wounded people and logistic for psychological aid (CUMP: cellule d'urgence médico- psychologique). The operational command The commander of rescue operation (COS) coordinates the rescue resources on site (public, private or associations). He must be easily spotted and has thus a yellow chasuble-like jacket on his clothes, with the inscription \\"Commandant les Opérations de Secours\\". He has an operational headquarters (PCO: poste de commandement opérationnel) near the site of the disaster. The OHQ has communications with all the resources and administratrions, including the police. The director of fire and rescue (DSI) The director of fire and rescue (DSI) is a firefighter officer. He manages: * the fighting against the initial disaster; * the search-and-rescue operations; * in the beginning, the scoop operations, before the medical chain is fully operational (increasing the resources) He has a yellow chasuble-like jacket with the inscription Directeur des Secours Incendie et Sauvetage. The director of medical rescue (DSM) The director of medical rescue (DSM) manages the medical chain described below. He has a yellow chasuble-like jacket with the inscription Directeur des Secours Médicaux. The medical chain Medical chain (casualty path) in an Orsed-Novi plan (mascal). The medical chain is organized in three parts. The personal attributed to each part are identified by a colour armband: red-white-blue. These are the colours of the French flag, and are also the symbol of: * red: danger zone; * white: medical zone; * blue: secured zone (away from the disaster site). The scoop The scoop follows of the extraction/extrication operations. It the responsibility of a firefighter officer. The casualties are transported by a stretcher chain (noria) to the advanced medical post (field hospital). This officer has a red chasuble-like jacket with the inscription \\"'\\", and the personal have a red armband. This part is also called \\"scoop noria\\" () or \\"small noria\\". The advanced medical post (AMP) The casualties are gathered at the advanced medical post (AMP, ), managed by a physician chosen by the director of medical rescue (DSM). He has to manage: * the care to the casualties; * the triage; * to search for a destination (hospital) adapted to the different affections (medical regulation). He commands: * a firefighter officer (') chosen by the commander of rescue operations (COS): he deals with the organization and logistics of the PMA * first responders, paramedical (nurses, ambulance men) and medical staff * a secretaryship made of firefighters, who deal with: ** the establishment of the list of casualties; ** filling the identification forms (FMA: fiches médicales de l'avant); ** transmitting the list of casualties to the operational headquarters (PCO). In urban environments, the advanced medical post (PMA) is often placed in a public location (bar, restaurant, hall of sports...). In wilderness or on a road away from any building, it is an inflatable structure. The advanced medical post (PMA) is organized in three zones corresponding to the triage: * Absolute emergency zone (): prehospital resuscitation unit for very serious cases: extreme emergencies () and grave injuries (U1); * Relative emergency zone (): for the seriously (U2) and lightly injured (U3) * Mortuary zone () for the deceased casualties. This zone is under the responsibility of the judicial police. Two additional zones can be created, besides the advanced medical (PMA) post but under the responsibility of the director of medical rescue (DSM): * a gathering zone for non-injured people, managed by volunteer (non-professional, association) first aiders * a zone for psychological support under the responsibility of physicians and psychiatrists, the MPEU (medical and psychological emergency unit, ). The chief physician of the advanced medical post has a white chasuble-like jacket with the inscription \\"'\\"; the firefighter officer has a white chasuble-like jacket with the inscription \\"PMA\\". The other staff members have a white armband. The evacuation The mission of the evacuation part is to gather and manage the patient evacuation resources, according to the needs expressed by the chief physician of the PMA. This area is managed by a firefighter officer. The evacuation resources can be firefighter rescue vehicles, private ambulance societies, vehicles from an association, helicopters, etc. The staff takes care that the instructions given by the chief physician are obeyed. The officer of this zone has a blue chasuble-like jacket with the inscription \\"'\\", and the staff members have a blue armband. This part is also called \\"evacuation noria\\" () or \\"great noria\\".

In 2002, Hemke was named Associate Dean Emeritus of the School of Music. Hemke retired from Northwestern University in 2012. From the start of his career in the early 1960s, building on the achievements of earlier influential American teachers of classical saxophone — including those of Larry Teal, Joseph Allard, Cecil Leeson, Sigurd Raschèr, and Vincent Abato — Hemke, and a handful of peer American saxophonists — including Eugene Rousseau and Donald Sinta — helped build American saxophone repertoire through composers that included Muczynski, Creston, Stein, Heiden, and Karlins. Journalist and author Michael Segell, in his 2005 book, The Devil's Horn, called Hemke \\"The Dean of Saxophone Education in America.\\" Hemke died on April 17, 2019.  Formal education  Paris Conservatory (2007) From 1955 to 1956, Hemke studied saxophone with Marcel Mule at the Paris Conservatoire National de Musique et de Declamation, earning in 1956 the Premier Prix diploma. Hemke holds the distinction of being the first American saxophonist to earn a Premier Prix diploma from the Paris Conservatory. In 1958, Hemke earned a Bachelor of Science degree in music education from University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. In 1962, he earned a Master of Music degree from the Eastman School of Music. In 1975, Hemke earned an A.Mus.D. degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In primary and secondary school, until the start of college, Hemke studied saxophone with Eddie Schmidt, a jobbing teacher, band director in Milwaukee, and a close friend of Ralph Joseph Hermann (1914–1994) — musician, composer, songwriter, and music publisher. Hemke was highly influenced by Schmidt's recording of Marcel Mule — and also of his recordings of Al Gallodoro, and Freddy Gardner. At the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Hemke studied with Jay Morton, teacher of woodwinds. Hemke did not have a formal saxophone teacher at Eastman, but while there, studied reeds with clarinetist Stanley Hasty (1920–2011), flute repertoire with Joseph Mariano (1911–2007), and oboe repertoire with Robert Sprenkle (1914–1988).Fostering Artistry and Pedagogy: Conversations With Artist- Teachers Frederick Hemke, Eugene Rousseau, and Donald Sinta, (PhD dissertation), by Julia Nolan, University of British Columbia (2012)\\"An Interview with Frederick Hemke,\\" by Jonathan Helton, The Saxophone Journal, Vol. 31, No. 1, pps. 26–31 (2006) Teaching career Hemke taught saxophone at Northwestern's School of Music for fifty years. He began in 1962 as a teaching associate. In 1964 he became an assistant professor and was appointed chairman of the newly formed Winds and Percussion Instruments Department. In 1967 Hemke was elevated to associate professor; on September 1, 1975, Full Professor; and on September 1, 1991, chairman of the Department of Music Performance Studies at the School of Music. Hemke served as senior associate dean for administration in the School of Music from 1995 to 2001. In 2002, Hemke was named the Louis and Elsie Snydacker Eckstein Professor of Music and also named associate dean emeritus of the School of Music. He retired from full-time teaching in 2012. As a music educator in higher education, Hemke has taught hundreds of saxophonists, many of whom have flourished as performing artists and music educators of international rank.

Hemke Reeds Hemke was well known as the designer of a line of reeds which bear the trademark \\"Frederick L. Hemke Reeds.\\" Rico Reeds began making the brand in 1982. Hemke was an artist-clinician for The Selmer Company, the North American distributor of saxophones made in France by the Paris firm, Henri Selmer Paris. In 1979 Hemke was host for the Sixth World Saxophone Congress held at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois.  Performing career  Hemke was an internationally acclaimed saxophone artist. Hemke has appeared extensively as a solo artist and has given master classes and lectures in the United States, Canada, Scandinavia, and the Far East. He performed with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and many other orchestras. He premiered several works for saxophone, including Allan Pettersson's Symphony No. 16 (February 24, 1983) and James Di Pasquale's Sonata for tenor saxophone. Di Pasquale, a prolific composer, had studied saxophone with Hemke and Sigurd Rascher. ;;Selected performances * Hemke made his New York debut on April 16, 1962, at the Town Hall, a storied concert venue that had its first-ever classical saxophone performance on February 5, 1937 — by Cecil Leeson. Hemke performed compositions by Pascal, Lantier, Rueff, Hartley, and Stein and arrangements by Mule of Bach and Leclair. * Premier, February 27, 2014, Augusta Read Thomas, Hemke Concerto, Prisms of Light, for solo alto saxophone and orchestra # \\"Illuminations\\" () # \\"Sunrise Ballad\\" # \\"Chasing Radiance\\" # \\"Solar Rings\\" : Hemke, saxophone, with the New Haven Symphony Orchestra, William Boughton conducting : Recorded at Woolsey Hall, New Haven, Connecticut, February 27, 2014 : Commissioned as a retirement gift to Fred Hemke by current and former students; the composer, Thomas, had been Hemke's colleague at Northwestern : From the album, A Portrait of Augusta Read Thomas, Nimbus Records (CD) (2014);  Advocacy for B tenor saxophone  In a traditional modern saxophone quartet — B soprano, E alto, B tenor, and E baritone saxophone — repertoire and popularity for solo classical was, and still is, dominated by B soprano and E alto saxophone. Bucking the trend, Hemke spent time focusing on the B tenor as a classical solo instrument, as evidenced by the release of his 1971 solo album, Music for Tenor Saxophone. In orchestral music, the tenor is known as one of the three saxophone voices in Ravel's Boléro — originally performed by two saxophonists, one on E sopranino and one on tenor doubling on B soprano. Recordings by tenor saxophone virtuoso James Houlik and others notwithstanding, classical tenor saxophone recordings make up a small portion of the classical saxophone repertoire and discography universe.

For alto saxophone, Hemke uses a custom version of the S-80. The mouthpiece is metal with a square chamber. The Selmer Mark VII E alto and B tenor saxophones, introduced in 1974, were designed in consultation with Hemke.  Miscellaneous  * For research, while in grad school at Eastman, Hemke had borrowed from H. & A. Selmer one of the world's original saxophones made by Adolphe Sax around 1860. On September 17, 1960, a custodian unwittingly stuffed a cardboard box containing the instrument into an incinerator and completely destroyed it. The only other one in existence was in a Paris museum. * Hemke has been a lifelong visual artist. His works are in the Regenstein Hall of Music at Northwestern University and on the covers of his albums.

It was released on July 7, 1970 by Elektra Records. Though initially commercially unsuccessful, Fun House developed a strong cult following. Like its predecessor (1969's The Stooges) and its successor (1973's Raw Power), it is generally considered integral in the development of punk rock.  Recording sessions  In 1969, Elektra Records had released the Stooges' debut album to mixed reviews and mediocre commercial success (peaking at number 106 on the Billboard charts). Company head Jac Holzman believed that MC5, another Michigan-based band, had more potential of success than the Stooges. Holzman asked former Kingsmen keyboardist Don Gallucci to produce the Stooges' second album. Having seen the group live, Gallucci told Holzman that the Stooges were an \\"interesting group, but I don't think you can get this feeling on tape\\". Holzman said it didn't matter because he had already reserved recording time in L.A. The album was recorded at Elektra Sound Recorders in Los Angeles, California, from May 11 to 25, 1970. Gallucci's plan as a producer was to use each day to record about a dozen takes of a particular song and then pick the one that would appear on the album. The first day consisted of sound checking and run-throughs of all songs. The entire band used headphones with the bass and drums isolated by baffles while singer Iggy Pop sang his vocals through a condenser microphone on a boom. The result was terrible in the band's opinion. They took exception to the atmosphere inside the studio with soundproof padding and isolators. To achieve their vision, the Stooges and Gallucci stripped the entire studio of its usual gear to emulate their live performances as closely as possible. According to Gallucci, they set up the band in the way they normally play at a concert. For example, Pop was singing through a handheld microphone, and the guitar and bass amps were placed side by side. The results were very raw when compared to many contemporary records; for example, without the normal isolation baffles the vibrations from the bass amplifier cause audible rattling of the snare drum on several songs. Pop indicated that iconic blues singer Howlin' Wolf \\"was really pertinent for me on Fun House. That stuff is Wolfy, at least as I could do it.\\" The Stooges intended for \\"Loose\\" to be the album's first track; Elektra, however, felt that \\"Down on the Street\\" would be the stronger opener. An alternate version of \\"Down on the Street\\", featuring a Doors-style organ overdubbed by Gallucci, was pulled from the album and released as a single. It was released the same month as Fun House, and fared slightly better on the charts.  Music and lyrics  According to Billboard magazine, Fun House is set in hard rock and improvisation. Music critic Robert Christgau characterized the album as \\"genuinely 'avant-garde' rock\\" because of the music's apt \\"repetitiveness\\", \\"solitary new-thing saxophone\\", and \\"L.A. Blues\\", which showcases the \\"old avant-garde fallacy ... trying to make art about chaos by reproducing same.\\" Greg Kot called Fun House \\"the Stooges' punk jazz opus\\". In 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005), music journalist Stevie Chick wrote that the sleazy tales of hedonism and reckless abandon on the album's first half are followed by \\"the comedown\\", as evoked by looser song structures, Steve Mackay's freeform saxophone, and \\"Iggy sounding like a scared, lost child, warning from bitter experience that 'The Fun House will steal your heart away.'\\" \\"L.A. Blues\\" concludes the album with a flurry of noise and disoriented dual drumming, which Stylus Magazines Patrick McNally interpreted as the Stooges being \\"lost culturally and spiritually in the smoke and riots and confusion of Detroit and America at the dawn of the seventies, but also in the overwhelming squall and clatter of the sound that they—from nothing, from nowhere—managed to create.\\"  Critical reception  In a contemporary review, Charles Burton from Rolling Stone found Fun House to be \\"much more sophisticated\\" than the Stooges' debut album, writing that they sounded \\"so exquisitely horrible and down and out that they are the ultimate psychedelic rock band in 1970\\". Roy Hollingworth of Melody Maker was unimpressed however, calling it the worst record of the year and \\"a muddy load of sluggish, unimaginative rubbish heavily disguised by electricity and called American rock\\". Christgau wrote in his original review for The Village Voice that the Stooges' competent monotony and incorporation of saxophone had intellectual appeal, but questioned whether it was healthy as a listener for \\"[me] to have to be in a certain mood of desperate abandon before I can get on with them musically\\". He later said his criticism had been based on the album's \\"inaccessibility\\" as popular music, and wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): In a retrospective review, AllMusic's Mark Deming hailed Fun House as \\"the ideal document of the Stooges at their raw, sweaty, howling peak\\", and wrote that it features better songs than their debut, significant improvement from each member, and Don Gallucci's energetic and immediate production. Dalton Ross of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the \\"radical\\" album sounded \\"primal, unpredictable, dangerous\\". Pitchfork critic Joe Tangari felt that the music's aggression has rarely been matched. He recommended it to \\"any rock fan with a sense of history\\" and asserted that, along with the Stooges' debut, Fun House is one of the most important predecessors to the punk rock movement. Barney Hoskyns called it a \\"proto-punk classic\\". In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Fun House number 191 on their list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list. Melody Maker said that it is, \\"no contest, the greatest rock n' roll album of all time\\". Lenny Kaye, writing for eMusic, called it a \\"rock and roll classic\\" and \\"one of the most frontal, aggressive, and joyously manic records ever\\". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Scott Seward claimed that, although saying so \\"risks hyperbole\\", Fun House is \\"one of the greatest rock & roll records of all time\\" and that, \\"as great as they were, the Stones never went so deep, the Beatles never sounded so alive, and anyone would have a hard time matching Iggy Pop's ferocity as a vocalist.\\"  Legacy and influence  Australian band Radio Birdman chose their name based on mishearing the line \\"radio burnin' up above\\" in the song \\"1970\\". They also named their Oxford Street performance venue The Oxford Funhouse and covered \\"TV Eye\\" on their 1977 album Radios Appear. John Zorn covered \\"T.V. Eye\\" for Rubáiyát: Elektra's 40th Anniversary: the same song was also covered for the glam rock film Velvet Goldmine by a supergroup featuring original Stooges guitarist Ron Asheton and members of Sonic Youth, with actor Ewan McGregor on vocals. The Birthday Party covered \\"Loose\\" on their 1982 live album Drunk on the Pope's Blood and, also live, the song \\"Funhouse\\": a version with sax played by J.G. Thirlwell appears on the 1999 CD The Birthday Party Live 81–82. the Damned's 1977 debut album, Damned Damned Damned, features a cover of \\"1970\\", entitled \\"I Feel Alright\\". Depeche Mode covered \\"Dirt\\" on their I Feel Loved single. Hanoi Rocks cover \\"1970\\" (titled \\"I Feel Alright\\") on their 1984 live album All Those Wasted Years. Spacemen 3 adapted \\"T.V. Eye\\" into the near-cover \\"OD Catastrophe\\" on their debut album Sound of Confusion. Michael Monroe also covered the song for his Another Night in the Sun live album in 2010. In 1989 indie rock band Blake Babies covered \\"Loose\\" for their album Earwig. They sampled Pop's voice into the song. Rage Against the Machine recorded a cover of \\"Down on the Street\\" on their 2000 covers album Renegades, and the main riff from their song \\"Sleep Now In the Fire\\" was inspired by the riff in \\"T.V. Eye\\". A cover of \\"Dirt\\" appears on disc one of Screeching Weasel's 1999 double CD compilation \\"Thank You Very Little\\". In 2010, the Nigerian songwriter Billy Bao and his band went into the studio exactly 40 years after the recording of the album and recorded their album \\"Buildings from Bilbao\\" using all titles and song times for their own songs (except \\"1970\\", which is updated as \\"2010\\", and \\"L.A. Blues\\", which is called \\"LAGOS Blues\\"). Numerous other musical artists have cited Fun House as their favorite album, including Joey Ramone, Mark E. Smith, Jack White, Nick Cave, Michael Gira, Buzz Osborne, Aaron North, Henry Rollins and Steve Albini.

Background Born Lorraine Zillner in Park Ridge, Illinois, she went on to graduate from the University of Illinois and began working in the office of Chicago's Douglas Aircraft facility. Fascinated with aircraft since childhood, she would spend her free time on the factory floor, admiring the C-54 Skymasters being produced there. After a test pilot took her for a ride in one, she began weekend flying lessons in a Piper J-3 Cub. WASPs Once the United States committed its involvement in World War II and male pilots were being called to serve, the WASP program was created for domestic support. Zillner had read that interviews for women with pilot licenses were being held for the experimental program. Despite not having a license and, initially, only eight of the 35 required hours of flight time, she was accepted for training two weeks later via telegram from the Department of the Army. Zillner began six months of classroom and flight training in September 1943 at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Texas. After graduating in February 1944, she reported for duty with the 5th Ferrying Group at Dallas Love Field. On December 20, 1944, General Henry H. Arnold dissolved the WASP program and Zillner was honorably discharged. Personal life Upon returning to Illinois, Zillner began working at Naval Air Station Glenview and met George Franklin Rodgers, a naval aviator. They were later married for 33 years, until his death shortly after retiring. She relocated to the original grounds of Mount Vernon in Alexandria, Virginia, and lived there until her death at age 97 on July 3, 2018.

The circuit has been used for Grand Prix and Formula One races and has hosted the South African Grand Prix many times. Among the Formula One races held at the track the 1977 South African Grand Prix stands out, as it is principally remembered for the fatal accident that claimed the lives of race marshal Frederick Jansen van Vuuren and driver Tom Pryce. In recent years, the area surrounding the circuit has developed into a residential and commercial suburb of Johannesburg. More recently, Kyalami has played host to five rounds of the Superbike World Championship from 1998 to 2002 and later in 2009 and 2010, the season finale of the Superstars Series in 2009 and 2010, and the South African round of the 2008–09 A1 Grand Prix season. International racing returned to the circuit in November 2019, when it hosted the 2019 Kyalami 9 Hours, serving as the season finale of the 2019 Intercontinental GT Challenge. It is scheduled to host the inaugural 6 Hours of Kyalami on 6 February 2021, as part of the 2020-21 FIA World Endurance Championship.  History  The original, sweeping circuit was in use from 1961 until political sanctions (due to apartheid policies) eliminated the Grand Prix after the 1985 race. When the circuit was rebuilt in the early 1990s as part of a commercial development, Leeukop Bend, the Kink, Pit lane, the start/finish straight, Crowthorne Corner and Barbeque Bend were all eliminated. Jukskei Sweep was heavily modified to create the entrance into the bend before the then newly built Pit lane and start/finish straight. The remaining part of the old fast circuit, modified to a lesser degree were Sunset Bend, Clubhouse Bend and the Esses still incorporated into the current configuration, with the result that the circuit became a narrow, twisty ribbon rather than one of the fastest circuits on the calendar. Formula One abandoned the rebuilt circuit in 1993 after just two races on the new layout, caused by a bankruptcy on the part of the promoter. It hosted the South African motorcycle Grand Prix until 1992. Kyalami was changed again with the building of the current pit lane and start/finish straight and later again changes were made, with the addition of a chicane which in turn was removed again for the 2009 World Superbike race. Kyalami came under new management and 2008 saw the 50th Anniversary of the 9-Hour revival being held at Kyalami with golden oldies like David Piper and others. On 6 June 2014, it was announced that Kyalami would be auctioned off on 24 July without reserve. On 24 July 2014, it was auctioned off for R205 million. The winning bidder was Toby Venter, owner of Porsche South Africa. R100 million was invested to upgrade the circuit, allowing it to successfully obtain an FIA Grade 2 status. On 12 December 2019, the provisional calendar for the 2020-21 FIA World Endurance Championship was announced, containing a six-hour race at Kyalami scheduled for 6 February 2021. However, after the calendar was revised due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, Kyalami was removed.

Barrelling further down the straight at full throttle, the second corner, named Crowthorne awaits. The typical braking point is around the 100-metre board. A second gear left-handed corner, it tightens before opening up on exit, setting the driver up for turns 3 and 4. The Jukskei Sweep as these corners were dubbed after the re-design, are a flat-out right-hander followed by a flat-out left handed kink throwing the driver into the braking zone for turn 5. Barbeque is a second gear left-handed corner which takes the driver onto the line of the classic circuit layout. Utilising the kerb on the exit of Barbeque is necessary as the driver has a short straight to prepare for turn 6. The driver would wait until after the 50-metre board before lifting off the throttle and dipping on the brakes through the quick right-hander known as Sunset, one of only four corners left as they were in the first layout. A short burst of throttle is followed by braking at the 50-metre board for turn 7, Clubhouse, a slow left- hander typically taken in second gear. Once again utilising the exit kerb, the driver barrels down a short straight before braking, again at the 50-metre board, for turn 8. Turns 8 and 9, known as The Esses, are the final corners left over from the first layout. 8 is a medium-speed left hander typically taken in third gear, dipping the driver downhill before the car is flicked right into turn 9. Acceleration is key as the driver rejoins the new layout, going uphill before having to brake roughly 50 metres for the blind tenth corner, known as Leeukop. The driver typically decelerates and shifts down the gears to second or first gear, meeting the apex of the corner before accelerating through turn 11. The back straight lasts for a few hundred metres before the driver approaches turn 12, a flat-out left hander known as Mineshaft. Spotting a braking point for turn 13, the first corner of The Crocodiles, can be hard, as it is an off-camber right handed turn which can be taken with several different lines. Turn 14 is little more than the full throttle exit of turn 13, and sets the driver up for turn 15. Cheetah is a tight right hander which the driver typically only needs to lift off the throttle for. It's important to carry speed through it, before spotting a braking point for the final corner. Ingwe is a slow left-hander which sends the driver back onto the start-finish straight to complete the lap. South African Grand Prix From 1967 to 1993, Kyalami hosted 21 editions of the South African Grand Prix. Perhaps the most infamous of these was the 1982 edition, when the Grand Prix Drivers' Association staged a strike in protest of new superlicence conditions imposed by FISA. Niki Lauda became the most successful driver at Kyalami, taking his third victory at the circuit in 1984. Alain Prost, Nigel Mansell and Jackie Stewart are the joint second-most successful drivers at the circuit, with two wins each. Jody Scheckter became the first and only South African driver to win their home race during the 1975 edition. Ferrari and Williams are the most successful constructors at the circuit, with four wins each.

Considered a landmark proto-punk release, the album peaked at number 106 on the US Billboard Top 200 Albums chart. The songs \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\" and \\"1969\\" were released as singles from the album; \\"1969\\" was featured on Rolling Stones list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitar Songs\\" at number 35.  Background and recording  For their first album, the Stooges had intended to record seven songs: \\"Dance of the Romance\\", \\"Goodbye Bozos\\", \\"I'm Sick\\", \\"Asthma Attack\\", \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\", \\"No Fun\\", and \\"1969\\". \\"Asthma Attack\\" was a completely different composition than the version of the song utilizing the same song title that appears on the album reissue. According to Iggy Pop, \\"'Asthma Attack' was a structured piece of repetitive descending chording that sounded a lot like 'Interstellar Overdrive.'\\" He elaborates further, \\"And it was B, A, G, E like a Who thing – and then I would wheeze and say, 'asthma attack.'\\" Embryonic versions of all seven songs were initially written from mid-late 1968 and early 1969. These seven songs were staples—and essentially the basis—of the Stooges' 1968 and early 1969 live set at the time. A typical Stooges song of the period would involve either two minutes of composed song followed by several minutes of improvisation or avant-garde, free-form workouts. Having assumed that the seven songs as normally performed would cover requirements for the album, the Stooges were told by their record label Elektra that they needed more material. Pop later recalled: \\"We auditioned [the seven-song version of the album] live in the studio and they refused it. Jac Holzman, head of Elektra Records, is quoted having said, 'There aren't enough songs that contain structured lead vocals!' So we lied and said, 'That's OK, we've got lots more proper songs.' Upon hearing this Holzman then indicated to the band that they had one week to record and prepare the album.\\" Within the week the group was able to complete the task the label requested and wrote four more songs, \\"We Will Fall\\" (based upon a musical chant by Dave Alexander), \\"Real Cool Time\\", \\"Not Right\\", and \\"Little Doll\\" (based upon new guitar riffs written by Ron Asheton during the week of the recording sessions), and after producer John Cale informed the band that they needed \\"one more song to complete the album\\", Iggy revised \\"Ann\\" (the first song he wrote for The Stooges that was initially discarded by the band in 1968). At the same time shedding two of the four avant-garde, free-form songs (shedding the original version for the new free- form version of \\"Asthma Attack\\" and \\"Dance of the Romance\\" now subsumed into the old composition \\"Ann\\" tacked on as a musical coda after the main structure of the song) including \\"I'm Sick\\" and \\"Goodbye Bozos\\" and playing the new compositions for the first time in the studio. An initial mix by John Cale, apparently resembling ex-Velvet Underground bandmate Lou Reed's \\"closet mix\\" of that band's eponymous third album from the same year, was rejected by Elektra. The mix as heard on the final product was done by Iggy Pop and Elektra president Jac Holzman. Four of Cale's original mixes would later appear on the bonus disc of a 2005 reissued version, with pitch correction applied to them. Five years later, all eight Cale mixes were released unaltered on the first disc of a 2010 collector's edition release of the album.  Reception and legacy  According to music historian Denise Sullivan, The Stooges was \\"disavowed\\" by most critics; Sullivan nonetheless called it \\"a rock'n'roll classic\\". In a contemporary review, Edmund O. Ward of Rolling Stone called it \\"loud, boring, tasteless, unimaginative and childish\\", while conceding that he \\"kind of liked it\\". Robert Christgau gave it a backhanded compliment in his column for The Village Voice, deeming it \\"stupid- rock at its best\\", but did give it a \\"B+\\" grade overall. In retrospect, Will Hodgkinson called The Stooges \\"charged and brutal garage-rock\\", and Pitchfork critic Joe Tangari said it was one of the essential forerunners to the punk rock movement of the 1970s. It and the Stooges' next two albums were later deemed \\"proto-punk landmarks\\", according to Mojo journalist Manish Agarwal. Daryl Easlea, writing for BBC Music, called the album \\"rock at its most primordial. ... [the] album is the original punk rock rush on record, a long- held well-kept secret by those in the know.\\" Mark Deming of AllMusic commented, \\"Part of the fun of The Stooges is, then as now, the band managed the difficult feat of sounding ahead of their time and entirely out of their time, all at once.\\" In 2003, the album was placed at number 185 on Rolling Stones list of the \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\", maintaining the rating in its 2012 revised list, and dropping to number 488 in its 2020 list. The magazine also included \\"1969\\" in their list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\\". Robert Dimery, writing in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, said that the album was \\"a collection of brilliant curios, which were neither full-on garage rock, nor out-and-out dirge.\\" In 2005, Q magazine placed \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\" at number 13 in its list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitar Tracks\\".  Reissues  On August 16, 2005, Elektra and Rhino Records jointly re-issued the album as a specially-priced double CD, with a remastered version of the album on disc one and alternate takes on disc two. On May 7, 2010, Rhino again released the album in their \\"Handmade\\" series as a collector's package including two CDs, a 7\\" record and a 7\\"x7\\"-sized booklet. The first disc features the main songs, the single version of \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\", and all original John Cale mixes of the eight songs. The second disc, and both sides of the 7\\" single, contain the previously unissued \\"Asthma Attack\\", a staple of the group's early live shows. In 2020, Vinyl Me, Please reissued the album on vinyl using the rejected John Cale mixes. This was the first time the tracks have ever appeared on a vinyl pressing.

With only a fixed internal street system, the architects referred to the hospital as \\"an indeterminate architecture\\" with \\"no final plan\\" – free to grow and change over time. It was opened by the Queen on 10 October 1970. It takes its name from Northwick Park, which is next to it. In 1994, St Mark's Hospital, previously located 10 miles away in central London, moved into a wing of the hospital formerly occupied by the Medical Research Council. While fighting extradition for murder and torture General Augusto Pinochet was a patient at Northwick Park Hospital in January 2000. In 2005, the hospital's maternity department was named as having one of the highest death rates in the United Kingdom. During the period April 2002 to March 2004, the maternal death rate for the maternity unit was 74.2 per 100,000, 6.5 times the national average of 11.4 per 100,000, as reported by Cemach (Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health). A range of \\"special measures\\" designed to improve maternity services and public confidence in the services was agreed with the Trust and these were all complied with within a year, but as of 2016 the Trust's maternity and gynaecology services were rated as 'requires improvement' by the Care Quality Commission. A 2016 Care Quality Commission report rated Northwick Park Hospital as 'requires improvement' overall, with only one out of eight assessment areas attaining a better rating. The report highlighted a number of concerns found during inspection visits, including that surgical staff were not always reporting incidents, patients experienced long waits, compliance with safeguarding training was poor, examples of poor infection control practice, a poor environment on the stroke wards, and that nutrition and hydration was poorly managed. The Commission subsequently issued the Trust with a Section 29 (A) warning notice. Facilities The hospital provides a full range of services including paediatrics, maxillofacial, orthopaedics, neurology, cardiology, elderly care medicine and a regional rehabilitation unit for patients with additional on-going acute medical needs. St Mark's Hospital, a national centre of gastrointestinal medicine is based at the same site, as is the British Olympic Association's Olympic Medical Institute. Local charity Radio Harrow is based within the hospital and has provided a patient visiting and broadcasting service since 1971.\\"Radio Harrow listing on the Charity Commission\\", Charity Commission for England and Wales Northwick Park is one of the few hospitals in England to have a paternoster lift transport system, but it is currently not in use. TGN incident On 13 March 2006, six people in a clinical trial at the independent Parexel drug trial unit (which is not run by London North West Healthcare NHS Trust) became severely unwell following administration of TGN1412, and were transferred to the intensive therapy unit at Northwick Park. Affected patients developed multi-organ failure and required intensive medical support by the critical care team at Northwick Park, led by Dr Ganesh Suntharalingam. All the patients subsequently survived and the last one was discharged in June 2006. Victims from this drug trial sought compensation for their multiple injuries with the help of a British law firm. Parexel, the American company responsible for the clinical trial, brought their own lawyers along for the hearings about the TGN1412 drug, billed as a possible wonder cure for arthritis, multiple sclerosis and leukaemia. The compensation money will largely be spent on equipment, adaptations and assistance they will need with their injuries. The incident was featured in the BBC 2 programme The Drug Trial: Emergency at the Hospital which aired in February 2017. In popular culture Northwick Park is the setting for the Channel 4 British sitcom Green Wing. The hospital features in the seventh series of ITV's Prime Suspect. In the 1976 film The Omen, the external scene when Katherine's body falls from a window and crashes into a parked ambulance was filmed at Northwick Park Hospital. In episode 6, series 1 of Fawlty Towers (\\"The Germans\\"), Sybil Fawlty is in Northwick Park Hospital for ingrown toenail surgery. Basil later joins her after he gets concussion during the fire drill. Before becoming the lead singer for Duran Duran, Simon Le Bon worked as a theatre porter at Northwick Park Hospital.

It is based on Miller's graphic novel of the same name. Much of the film is based on the first, third, and fourth books in Miller's original comic series. The Hard Goodbye is about an ex-convict who embarks on a rampage in search of his one-time sweetheart's killer. The Big Fat Kill follows a private investigator who gets caught in a street war between a group of prostitutes and a group of mercenaries, the police and the mob. That Yellow Bastard focuses on an aging police officer who protects a young woman from a grotesquely disfigured serial killer. The intro and outro of the film are based on the short story \\"The Customer is Always Right\\" which is collected in Booze, Broads & Bullets, the sixth book in the comic series. The film stars an ensemble cast led by Jessica Alba, Benicio del Toro, Brittany Murphy, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, and Elijah Wood, and featuring Alexis Bledel, Michael Clarke Duncan, Rosario Dawson, Carla Gugino, Rutger Hauer, Jaime King, Michael Madsen, Nick Stahl, and Makenzie Vega among others. Sin City opened to wide critical and commercial success, gathering particular recognition for the film's unique color processing which rendered most of the film in black and white while retaining or adding color for selected objects. The film was screened at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival in competition and won the Technical Grand Prize for the film's \\"visual shaping\\". A sequel, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, was released in 2014, also directed by Miller and Rodriguez.  Plot =\\"The Customer Is Always Right (Part I)\\" The Salesman walks onto a penthouse balcony where The Customer looks out over Basin City. He offers her a cigarette and says that she looks like someone who is tired of running and that he will save her. The two share a kiss and he shoots her; she dies in his arms. He says he will never know what she was running from but that he will cash her check in the morning. \\"That Yellow Bastard (Part I)\\" On the docks of Sin City, aging police officer John Hartigan tries to stop serial child-killer Roark Junior from raping and killing his fourth known victim, eleven-year-old Nancy Callahan. Junior is the son of Senator Roark, who has bribed the police to cover up his son's crimes. Hartigan's corrupt partner, Bob tries to convince Hartigan to walk away; Hartigan knocks him out. Hartigan, experiencing pain from a bad heart, heads into the warehouse where Roark Junior and several henchmen are holding Nancy. Junior shoots Hartigan in the shoulder and tries to escape. Hartigan catches up and shoots off Junior's ear, hand and genitals. Bob, now recovered, shoots Hartigan in the back. As the sirens approach, Bob leaves and Nancy lies down in Hartigan's lap. Hartigan passes out, reasoning his death is a fair trade for the girl's life. \\"The Hard Goodbye\\" After a one-night stand, Marv awakens to find Goldie has been killed while he slept. He flees the frame-up as the police arrive, vowing to avenge her death. His parole officer, Lucille, warns him to give up on this mission, believing Marv may have imagined it all due to his \\"condition\\". Marv interrogates several informants, working up to a corrupt priest, who reveals that the Roark family was behind the murder. Marv kills the priest but is then attacked by a woman who looks like Goldie, which he dismisses as a hallucination. Marv goes to the Roark family farm and is subdued by the silent stalker who killed Goldie. He awakens in the basement to find Lucille has been captured after looking into his story. She tells Marv that the killer is a cannibal and that Goldie was a prostitute. He learns that the killer's name is Kevin and escapes. Lucille is shot by the leader of a squad of corrupt cops. Marv kills the cops except for their leader, whom he interrogates. He learns that Cardinal Patrick Henry Roark arranged for Goldie's murder. Marv goes to Old Town, Sin City's prostitute-run red-light district, to learn more about Goldie and is captured by her twin sister, Wendy, the attacker Marv previously dismissed as a hallucination. Once he convinces Wendy that he is not the killer, the two return to the farm where Marv kills Kevin. He confronts Cardinal Roark, who confesses his part in the murders. Kevin was the cardinal's ward; the two men ate the prostitutes to \\"consume their souls\\". Marv kills the cardinal but is then shot and captured by his guards. Marv is taken to a hospital where cops threaten to kill his mother, to get him to confess to killing Roark, Kevin and their victims. He is sentenced to death in the electric chair. Wendy visits him on death row and thanks him for avenging her sister. Marv is then executed. \\"The Big Fat Kill\\" Shellie is being harassed by her abusive ex-boyfriend Jackie Boy and his cronies. Her boyfriend, Dwight violently warns him to leave Shellie alone. Jackie Boy and his cronies flee to Old Town. Dwight follows and sees them harass Becky, a young prostitute. Gail, the prostitutes' leader and Dwight's on-and-off lover, also witnesses the scene. When Jackie Boy threatens Becky with a gun, Miho, a martial arts expert, kills Jackie Boy and his friends. They realize Jackie Boy is actually Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty of the Basin City Police, considered a \\"hero cop\\" by the press. If the cops learn how he died, their truce with the prostitutes would end and the mob would be free to wage war on Old Town. Dwight takes the bodies to a tar pit, where he is attacked by an ex-IRA mercenary hired by mob boss Wallenquist. He nearly drowns in the tar before Miho saves him. The mercenary flees to the sewer with Jackie Boy's severed head but Dwight and Miho retrieve it and return to Old Town. Meanwhile, mob enforcer Manute kidnaps Gail. Becky, threatened with the death of her mother by the mob, betrays the prostitutes. Manute prepares the mob's invasion of Old Town. Dwight trades Jackie Boy's head for Gail's freedom but the head is stuffed with explosives; Dwight detonates it, destroying the evidence and Gail's captors. The other prostitutes gun down the mercenaries while Becky, injured in the fight, escapes. \\"That Yellow Bastard (Part II)\\" Hartigan is recovering in a hospital when Senator Roark informs him that Junior is in a coma and the Roark legacy is in serious jeopardy. Hartigan will be framed for Junior's crimes; if he tells anyone the truth, they will die. A grateful Nancy promises to write letters every week while he is in prison. Hartigan goes to jail, though he refuses to confess. He receives a weekly letter from Nancy, as promised. After eight years, the letters stop and he receives a severed finger instead. Hartigan confesses to all charges, leading to his parole, and searches for an adult Nancy, not knowing he is being followed by a deformed, yellow man. He eventually finds her at Kadie's Bar, where she has become an exotic dancer. He realizes he was set up to lead the yellow man to Nancy and the two escape in Nancy's car. Hiding in the trunk of Hartigan's car, the deformed man returns, revealing himself as Roark Junior, disfigured by years of surgery to regenerate his body parts. Junior attacks Hartigan and takes Nancy to the Roark farm to finish what he started eight years before. Hartigan follows and fakes a heart attack, giving him a chance to kill Junior. Knowing that Senator Roark will never stop hunting them, Hartigan commits suicide to ensure Nancy's safety. Again, he justifies his life for Nancy's as a fair trade. \\"The Customer Is Always Right (Part II)\\" An injured Becky departs from a hospital, talking on a cell phone with her mother. In the elevator she encounters The Salesman, dressed as a doctor. He offers her a cigarette, calling her by name, and she abruptly ends the call with her mother.  Cast  Frank Miller makes a cameo appearance as a priest, while Robert Rodriguez makes a cameo appearance as a member of the SWAT team.  Production  Becky (Alexis Bledel) walking down a street. An example of the film's neo-noir atmosphere.  Filming  Principal photography began on March 29, 2004. Several of the scenes were shot before any actor had signed on; as a result, several stand-ins were used before the actual actors were digitally added into the film during post-production. Rodriguez, an aficionado of cinematic technology, has used similar techniques in the past. In Roger Ebert's review of the film, he recalled Rodriguez's speech during production of Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams: \\"This is the future! You don't wait six hours for a scene to be lighted. You want a light over here, you grab a light and put it over here. You want a nuclear submarine, you make one out of thin air and put your characters into it.\\" The film was noted throughout production for Rodriguez's plan to stay faithful to the source material, unlike most other comic book adaptations. Rodriguez stated that he considered the film to be \\"less of an adaptation than a translation\\". As a result, there is no screenwriting in the credits; simply \\"Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller\\". There were several minor changes, such as dialogue trimming, new colorized objects, removal of some nudity, slightly edited violence, and minor deleted scenes. These scenes were later added in the release of the Sin City Collectors DVD, which also split the books into four separate stories.  Music  The soundtrack was composed by Rodriguez, John Debney, and Graeme Revell. The film's three main stories were each scored by an individual composer: Revell scored \\"The Hard Goodbye\\", Debney scored \\"The Big Fat Kill\\", and Rodriguez scored \\"That Yellow Bastard\\". Additionally, Rodriguez co-scored with the other two composers on several tracks. Another notable piece of music used was the instrumental version of the song \\"Cells\\" by the London-based alternative group The Servant. The song was heavily featured in the film's publicity, including the promotional trailers and television spots, and being featured on the film's DVD menus. \\"Sensemayá\\" by Silvestre Revueltas is also used on the end sequence of \\"That Yellow Bastard\\". Fluke's track \\"Absurd\\" is also used when Hartigan first enters Kadie's.  Credits  Three directors received credit for Sin City: Miller, Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino, the last for directing the drive-to-the-pits scene in which Dwight talks with a dead Jack Rafferty (Benicio del Toro). Miller and Rodriguez worked as a team directing the rest of the film. When the Directors Guild of America refused to allow two directors that were not an established team to be credited (especially since Miller had never directed before), Rodriguez first planned to give Miller full credit. Miller would not accept this. Rodriguez, also refusing to take full credit, decided to resign from the Guild so that the joint credit could remain.  Release =Home media The film was released on DVD on August 16, 2005.  Critical reception  Sin City opened on April 1, 2005 to generally positive reviews. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 77% based on 251 reviews, with an average rating of 7.42/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Visually groundbreaking and terrifically violent, Sin City brings the dark world of Frank Miller's graphic novel to vivid life.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 74 (citing \\"generally favorable reviews\\") based on 40 reviews. A 2017 data analysis of Metacritic reviews by Gizmodo UK found Sin City to be the third most critically divisive film of recent years. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert awarded the film 4/4 stars, describing it as \\"a visualization of the pulp noir imagination, uncompromising and extreme. Yes, and brilliant.\\" Online critical reaction was particularly strong: James Berardinelli placed the film on his list of the \\"Top Ten\\" films of 2005. Chauncey Mabe of the Sun-Sentinel wrote: \\"Really, there will be no reason for anyone to make a comic-book film ever again. Miller and Rodriguez have pushed the form as far as it can possibly go.\\"\\"'Sin City' Review\\". Film-Finder.com. Several reviews focused predominantly on the film's more graphic content, criticizing it for a lack of \\"humanity\\", the overwhelmingly dominant themes of violence against women, typically of an exploitative or sexualized nature. William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer described it as a celebration of \\"helpless people being tortured ...I kept thinking of those clean-cut young American guards at Abu Ghraib. That is exactly the mentality Rodriguez is celebrating here. Sin City is their movie.\\" The New York Times critic Manohla Dargis claimed that the directors' \\"commitment to absolute unreality and the absence of the human factor\\" made it \\"hard to get pulled into the story on any level other than the visceral.\\" Credit is given for Rodriguez's \\"scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences\\" but Dargis notes \\"it's a shame the movie is kind of a bore\\" where the private experience of reading a graphic novel does not translate, stating that \\"the problem is, this is his private experience, not ours\\".Dargis, Manohla (April 1, 2005). \\"A Savage and Sexy City of Pulp Fiction Regulars\\". NYTimes.com. Retrieved September 2, 2012. In a more lighthearted piece focusing on the progression of films and the origins of Sin City, fellow Times critic A. O. Scott, identifying Who Framed Roger Rabbit as its chief cinematic predecessor, argued that \\"Something is missing – something human. Don't let the movies fool you: Roger Rabbit was guilty,\\" with regard to the increasing use of digitisation within films to replace the human elements. He applauds the fact Rodriguez \\"has rendered a gorgeous world of silvery shadows that updates the expressionist cinematography of postwar noir\\" but bemoans that several elements of \\"old film noirs has been digitally broomed away\\", resulting instead in a film that \\"offers sensation without feeling, death without grief, sin without guilt, and, ultimately, novelty without surprise\\". Sin City is described as a neo-noir film by some authors.Conard, Mark T.; ed. (2009). The Philosophy of Neo-Noir. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky. .  Box office  Sin City grossed $29.1 million on its opening weekend, defeating fellow opener Beauty Shop by more than twice its opening take. The film saw a sharp decline in its second weekend, dropping over 50%. Ultimately, the film ended its North American run with a gross of $74.1 million against its $40 million negative cost. Overseas, the film grossed $84.6 million, for a worldwide total from theater receipts of $158.7 million.  Accolades  Mickey Rourke won a Saturn Award, an Online Film Critics Society Award, a Chicago Film Critics Association Award, and an Irish Film & Television Award for his performance. The film was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, and Rodriguez won the Technical Grand Prize for the film's visual shaping. Graeme Revell's work in the film was honored with a Best Film Music Award at the BMI Film & TV Awards. Sin City was nominated at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards in three categories: Best Movie, Best Kiss for Clive Owen and Rosario Dawson, and Sexiest Performance for Jessica Alba, winning the latter. The film also received three nominations at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards: Choice Movie: Action, Choice Movie: Action Actress for Jessica Alba and Choice Movie: Villain for Elijah Wood.  Sequel  A sequel, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, was released on August 22, 2014. Production for the sequel began in October 2012 with Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller directing a script co-written by them and William Monahan. The film was based mainly on A Dame to Kill For, the second book in the Sin City series by Miller, and also included the short story \\"Just Another Saturday Night\\" from the Booze, Broads, & Bullets collection, as well as two original stories written by Miller for the film, titled \\"The Long Bad Night\\" and \\"Nancy's Last Dance\\". Actors Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba all reprised their roles in the sequel, amongst others. Unlike the 2005 original, the sequel was a critical and financial failure.  TV series  Dimension Films is developing a soft reboot of the series for television, Stephen L’Heureux who produced the second film will oversee the series with Sin City creator Frank Miller. This will be with new characters and timelines and be more like the comics rather than the films. In November 2019, Deadline reports that Legendary Pictures bought the rights for the television series and are developing both a live action and animated series of Sin City with both Miller and Rodriguez in talks to work on the series as executive producers.

History The name \\"oină\\" was originally \\"hoina\\", and is derived from the Cuman word oyn \\"game\\" (a cognate of Turkish oyun).oină , in Alexandru Ciorănescu, Dicționarul etimologic român, Universidad de la Laguna, Tenerife, 1958-1966. The oldest direct mention comes from a diet manual of 1782 by medic István Mátyus, who talks about the health benefits of oina. In 1899, Spiru Haret, the minister of education decided that oină was to be played in schools in physical education classes. He organized the first annual oină competitions. The Romanian Oină Federation (\\"Federaţia Română de Oină\\") was founded in 1932, and was reactivated at the beginning of the 1950s, after a brief period when it was dissolved. Today, there are two oină federations: one in Bucharest, Romania and another one in Chișinău, Moldova. Pitch Oină pitch animation The pitch is a rectangle, 70m long by 32m wide divided into: * the in game (\\"în joc\\") area, which is 60x32m * the batting zone (\\"zona de bătaie\\") - 5m long - delimited from the in game area by the batting line * the back zone (\\"zona de fund\\") - a 5m long safe zone during a run - delimited from the in game area by the back line The attacking side player that has commenced a run will have to cross the following four lines in order: * the start line (the left side of the batting line) * the arrival line (the left side of the back line) * the return line (the right side of the back line) * the escape line (the right side of the batting line) The in game area is further split into the advance and return triangles and squares. At the intersection of the lines inside the game area and the pitch limits or other lines within the game area, there are circles which determine the positions of the midfielders (\\"mijlocași\\") and side players (\\"mărginași\\"). The 1m and 3m semicircles are used for batting and serving. A waiting line is drawn for attacking players to wait their turn to bat. Players There are two teams of 11 players, one attacking side or \\"at bat\\" (\\"la bătaie\\") and one defending side or \\"at catch\\" (\\"la prindere\\"). The roles switch at half time. The defending players are placed in the following positions: * 3 midfielders (\\"mijlocași\\") * 3 advance side players (\\"mărginași de ducere\\") * 3 return side players (\\"mărginași de întoarcere\\") * 1 back player (\\"fundaș\\") that is free to move within the back zone * 1 forward player (\\"fruntaș\\") that is free to move within the batting zone The attacking players change roles as the game progresses. The roles are chronologically ordered this way: * waiting one's turn * serving the ball * batting * waiting to enter the game (make a run) * running the advance corridor * staying in the back zone * running the return corridor Each team has a captain (\\"căpitan\\" or \\"baci\\"\\"). The midfielder 2 is usually used as captain because he can throw the ball at an attacking player in any in game position. For this reason, the midfielder 2 is also known as a baci. Each team has a maximum of 5 substitutes available. Scope of the game The teams have very different roles depending on whether they are at bat or at catch. At bat players are tasked to open a play and run the lanes until they cross the escape line. At catch players are tasked to hit the players running the lanes with the ball. There can be a maximum of 2 players running each lane at the same time. A player can be hit in both lanes once. Rules The team at bat is selected by a ritual where the players have to grab the bat, thrown by the referee, and the last one to be able to place at least 4 fingers on the bat wins. The game begins with the team at bat, with one of the players throwing the ball while another player of the same team has to hit it with a wooden bat (\\"bâtă\\") and send it as far as he can towards the adversary field. After that, if the ball is caught by the adversaries, the player can run (if he wishes, or if he is forced to run by the referee) the advance and return corridors/lanes (\\"culoarele de ducere și întoarcere\\"), without being hit by the defenders. If he stops the ball with his palm, it is not considered a hit. The player is not allowed to catch the ball, and he must release it immediately. If the player doing a run is hit he goes out of field and into the back zone, or he finishes his tasks, depending on which lane he is running. The full set of regulations can be found here. Scoring=In game At catch players score 2 points for each player hit with a ball, unless the ball touches the palm or the back of the palm. At bat players score by batting beyond certain lines, like so: * the ball crosses the 65m line in the air and does not go out of bounds (does not cross the lateral lines), whether or not the defense touches the ball in the air - 2 points * the ball falls in the back zone - 2 points * the ball is touched in the air by the defense, and goes out of bounds in the air from within the back zone - 2 points * the ball goes out of bounds in the air from within the back zone without being touched by the defense - 1 point * the ball crosses the 60m line (the back line) in the air and is caught by the defense - 1 point * the ball crosses the threequarters line in the air and falls in the threequarters area - 1 point * the ball goes out of bounds in the air from within the threequarters area - 1 point * the ball is diverted out of bounds in the air from within the threequartees area by the defense - 1 point * the ball falls on the threequarters area of the back line - 1 point * the ball is diverted from within the threequarters area in front of the threequarters line by the defense and is not subsequently caught in the air - 1 point Competition Winning brings the team 3 points, a draw brings in 2 points, and the losing team will score 1 point. Quitting or elimination of the team will result in no points being awarded and a 0-9 loss. Running out of substitutes due to injuries will result in a 0-6 loss and 1 point being awarded, while if the same situation is due to the elimination of a player, the result will be a 0-9 loss and no points being awarded. Ball A spherical ball made of leather, filled with horse, pig, or bovine hair is used in oină. The ball is around 8 cm in diameter and 140 grams in senior games and around 7 cm in diameter and 100 grams in U-18 games. Comparison with baseball * Similar weight of the ball: around 140 grams for both * Longer and slimmer bat for oină * A game takes only 30 minutes for oină * Oină teams have 11 players; Baseball teams have 9 players * In oină, the defense can score by hitting the attacking players that are in game (running the lanes) Competitions in Romania All competitions are organized by the governing body, the Romanian Oină Federation (\\"Federaţia Română de Oină\\" - FRO). The main competitions are: * The National Championship * The Romanian Cup * The Romanian Supercup * The National Junior Championship Other competitions in 2010 2010 calendar are: * \\"Dragu\\" Cup * \\"Gherăiești\\" Cup * \\"Antena Satelor\\" National Championship (junior) * Federation Cup * Border Police Cup * \\"Monteoru\\" Cup * \\"Cleopatra\\" Cup (beach oină) * \\"Zarandului\\" Cup * \\"Tătaru\\" Cup * Village Cup * \\"Antena Satelor\\" Cup *various other junior and indoor oină competitions A number of international events are organized: * \\"Cronos\\" Cup (junior) * International Festival of Sports Related to Oină * Oină-Lapta Tournament Internationalizing Oină Oină and variants of the sport are also played in neighboring countries where there has been or still is a Romanian ethnic or cultural presence. As part of its program to bring oină to the spotlight again, the FRO has begun the process of creating an international federation. Romania and the Republic of Moldova place the foundation of the International Oină Federation A minimum of 3 national federations need to exist in order to form an international federation, and 2 exist already (the Romanian and Moldovan federations). The FRO has begun talks of founding oină clubs and federations in neighboring Bulgaria and Serbia,http://froina.sportlocal.ro/blog/stiri.html#Oina%20ajunge and in Sweden.http://froina.sportlocal.ro/blog/stiri.html#Turneu%20international Demonstration matches are to be held in Serbia.

The president is elected for a five-year term. The Parliament is composed of members directly elected to represent constituencies, and one woman representative for every district; as well representatives of special interest groups, including the army, youth, workers and persons with disabilities. Overview The first national election in Uganda was the Uganda National Assembly election of 1962. An alliance between the Uganda People's Congress (UPC) and Kabaka Yekka (KY) won the majority of parliamentary seats, and formed Uganda's first post-independence government with Obote as executive Prime Minister.History of Parliament (Website of the Parliament of Uganda) A period of dictatorship and political strife, including the tenures of Idi Amin, Yusuf Lule and Godfrey Binaisa, meant no elections were held until the presidential election of December 1980. Obote was pronounced the winner amid bitter dispute and allegations of electoral fraud. Yoweri Museveni, one of the presidential aspirants, declared an armed rebellion, and waged a guerrilla war (the Ugandan Bush War) against the government of Obote. Museveni's National Resistance Army (NRA) took power in 1986 from the government of Gen. Tito Okello Lutwa who had six months earlier toppled Obote's UPC government in a July 27, 1985 military coup, making him president. Museveni and his National Resistance Movement (NRM) created a form of \\"no-party democracy\\", banning political parties from fielding candidates directly in elections. In the \\"no- party\\" presidential election in 1996, Museveni defeated Paul Ssemogerere and Mohamed Mayanja by a landslide. Although international and domestic observers described the vote as valid, both the losing candidates rejected the results. In the following presidential election, held in 2001, Museveni won by a substantial majority, with Kizza Besigye as the only real challenger. Despite a protest against the results, citing massive voter intimidation and rigging, the outcome was accepted by the Supreme Court of Uganda. In the 2005 constitutional referendum, Ugandans voted to restore a multi-party political system, lifting the 19-year restriction on the activities of political parties. The 2006 general election was the first multiparty election in 25 years. Museveni won 59% of the presidential vote, and his party, the National Resistance Movement, won the majority of parliamentary seats.

He was a leading member of the Country Party, forerunners of the Whigs, who during the reign of King Charles II, laid the groundwork for opposition in the House of Commons to the accession of an openly Catholic king in Charles's brother James. This ultimately resulted in Russell's execution for treason, almost two years before Charles died and James acceded to the throne. Early life and marriage Born Hon. William Russell, he was the third son of William Russell, 5th Earl of Bedford, later created Duke of Bedford, and Lady Anne Carr. After the death of his elder brother Francis (1638–1679), he gained the courtesy title of Baron Russell and was thus referred to as Lord Russell. He and Francis were at Cambridge University in 1654. They then travelled abroad, visiting Lyon and Geneva, residing for a time at Augsburg. Russell's account makes for a colourful depiction of his travels. The two made their way to Paris by 1658, and had returned to Woburn Abbey, Woburn (which was not then in its present palatial form) by December 1659. At the Restoration in 1660, when Charles II took the throne, Russell was elected as a Member of Parliament for the borough of Tavistock, a seat traditionally held by a member of his family.History of Parliament Online - Russell, Hon. William For many years, Russell appears not to have been active in public affairs, but to have indulged in court intrigue, and is not recorded as speaking until 1674. In 1663 and 1664 he was engaged in two duels; he was wounded in the second one. In 1669, at age 30, he married the widowed Lady Vaughn.thePeerage.com He thus became connected with the Earl of Shaftesbury, who had married his wife's cousin. They had a close and affectionate marriage. Parliament William, Lord Russell It was not until the formation of the country party (the forerunner of the Whig party),britainexpress which opposed the policies of the Cabal (the inner group of advisers to the king) and Charles II's Franco-Catholic policies, that Russell began to take an active part in affairs. With a passionate zeal against Roman Catholicism ( \\"I despise such a ridiculous and nonsensical religion\\" he once remarked), and an intense love of political liberty, he opposed persecution of Protestant Dissenters. His first speech in Parliament appears to have been on 22 January 1674, when he inveighed against the Great Stop of the Exchequer, the attack on the Smyrna fleet, the corruption by French money of Charles's courtiers, and the ill- intended ministers of the king. He also supported the proceedings against the Duke of Buckingham. In 1675, Russell moved an address to the king for the removal from royal councils and impeachment of the Earl of Danby. On 15 February 1677, in the debate on the 15 months' prorogation (an extremely lengthy period between sessions of Parliament), he moved the dissolution of Parliament; and in March 1678 he seconded the address that asked the king to declare war against France. The enmity of the country party towards James, the Duke of York, and towards Lord Danby, and the party's desire for a dissolution and the disbanding of the army, were greater than the party's enmity towards Louis XIV of France. The French king therefore found it easy to form a temporary alliance with Russell, Holles and the opposition leaders. They sought to cripple the king's power of hurting France and to compel him to seek Louis's friendship; that friendship, however, was to be given only on the condition that Louis support their goals. Russell entered into close communication with the Marquis de Ruvigny (Lady Russell's maternal cousin), who came over to England with money for distribution among members of parliament. By the testimony of Barillon, however, it is clear that Russell himself refused to take any French payments. The alleged Popish Plot and the Monmouth Rebellion Anti-French, warmongering alarms which culminated in the \\"discovery\\" in 1678 of the first \\"conspirators\\" of an alleged Popish Plot to treacherously murder King Charles II and accelerate the accession of his Roman Catholic brother, appear to have affected Russell more than his otherwise sober character would have led people to expect. Russell threw himself into the small party which looked to James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth ('Monmouth') to take the throne, an (illegitimate but recognised) son of Charles, as the representative of Protestant interests, a political blunder. Undaunted, Russell afterwards was in confidential communication with William of Orange who, with his wife Mary, came to the throne five years after Russell's execution. Exclusion debates On 4 November 1678, Russell moved an address to the King to exclude his brother James (at the time the Duke of York) \\"from his person and councils\\" (homes, companionship and correspondence), including removal from the line of succession. Parliament's insistence on the impeachment of Danby led to it being prorogued on 30 December and dissolved in January. At the ensuing election, Russell was again elected to Parliament, this time as a representative for Bedfordshire, as well as for Hampshire (for which he chose not to sit). The success of the newly formed 'party' in the elections of 1679 led to Danby's removal from cabinet, and in April 1679 Russell became a member of the new Privy Council Ministry formed by Charles on the advice of Sir William Temple of Temple Mount, East Sheen.Sir George Clarke. The Later Stuarts, 1660–1714 (2nd edition, Clarendon Press, 1955), 97–99. Only six days after this, Russell moved for a committee to draw up a more subdued bill \\"to secure religion and property [in case of] a popish successor\\". In June 1679, when the Covenanters were rising in Scotland, he verbally attacked (the Duke of) Lauderdale personally in full council. The Trial of William, Lord Russell, in 1683 by Sir George Hayter, painted in 1825 as a commission by his descendant The 6th Duke of Bedford In January 1680, Russell, along with Cavendish, Capell, Powle, and Essex, tendered resignation, which was received by King Charles \\"with all my heart.\\" On 16 June, he accompanied Shaftesbury when the latter indicted James at Westminster as a popish recusant; and on 26 October, he spoke in the house to move to \\"suppress popery and prevent a popish successor\\"; while on 2 November, now at the height of his influence, he seconded the motion for exclusion in its most emphatic shape, and on 19 November physically carried the exclusion bill to the House of Lords. He opposed the limitation scheme on the ground that monarchy under its conditions would be an absurdity. The historian Laurence EchardLaurence Echard (History of England, ii.) stated that Russell opposed the indulgence exercised by Charles to the Duke of Norfolk's cousin Lord Stafford who was a convicted \\"plotter\\", in preventing a more painful method of execution – an indulgence afterwards shown to Russell himself but other historians disagree. On 18 December, he moved to refuse supplies until the king passed the Exclusion Bill. The Prince of Orange having come over at this time, the opposition leaders were open to a compromise on the exclusion question. Russell, however, refused to give way. On 26 March 1681, in the parliament held at Oxford, Russell again seconded the Exclusion Bill. Upon the dissolution of parliament, he retired into privacy at his country seat of Stratton in Hampshire. It was probably at his wish that his chaplain wrote the Life of Julian the Apostate, in reply to Dr Hickes's sermons, defending the lawfulness of resistance in extreme cases. Rye House Plot William, Lord Russell (1639–1683), in the Tower of London – Painter Mather Brown He had no share in the schemes of Whig Lord Shaftesbury after the election of Tory sheriffs for London in 1682; upon the 1683 violation of the charters however he began seriously to consider the best means of resisting the King's government. In October 1682, he attended a meeting at which what might be construed as treason was talked: Monmouth, Essex, Hampden, Algernon Sidney, Lord Howard of Escrick and Sir Thomas Armstrong met at the house of one Mr Sheppard, a wine merchant. There they met Richard Rumbold, the owner of Rye House, a fortified mansion in Hertfordshire. This was followed by the unsuccessful Rye House Plot, a plan to ambush Charles II and his brother James near Rye House, Hoddesdon, on their way back to London from the Newmarket races. However the plot was disclosed to the government. Unlike several co- conspirators, Russell refused to escape to Holland. He was accused of promising his assistance to raise an insurrection and bring about the death of the king. He was sent on 26 June 1683 to the Tower of London where he prepared himself for his death. Monmouth offered to return to England and be tried if doing so would help Russell, and Essex refused to abscond for fear of injuring his friend's chance of escape. However, he was tried and convicted of treason and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered, afterwards commuted by Charles II to death by beheading. By the standards of the time (when those charged with treason rarely escaped death) he received a fair trial. Lord Chief Justice Francis Pemberton, in his summing up to the jury, clearly leaned towards an acquittal, thereby offending the King, who dismissed him soon afterwards. No defence counsel was permitted in a treason trial until the passing of the Treason Act 1695, but in a rare concession to the defence, Lady Russell was allowed to act as her husband's secretary. Even Jeffreys, leading for the prosecution, conducted the trial in a sober and dignified manner quite different from his normal bullying style, and, while stressing the strength of the evidence, reminded the jury that no innocent man should have his life taken away. After the verdict Russell's wife and friends made desperate efforts to save him, making pleas for mercy to the King, the Duke of York, and the French Ambassador, Paul Barillon. Barillon informed the King that in the view of Louis XIV this was a suitable case for mercy, and James was at least prepared to listen to Russell's friends; but Charles was implacable, saying \\"if I do not take his life he will shortly take mine.\\" Russell himself, in petitions to Charles and James, offered to live abroad if his life were spared, and never again to meddle in the affairs of England. He however refused an offer of escape from Cavendish. Lady Russell obtained a private interview and went on her knees to the King, but to no avail: Charles, who showed clemency to former opponents after his Restoration, no longer believed in showing mercy to his real or supposed enemies. Execution 18th century artist's impression of Lord Russell's last interview with his family before his execution. Russell spent his last day peacefully in the Tower, spending the morning in devotions with the Scottish archbishop Alexander Burnet. He was beheaded by Jack Ketch on 21 July 1683 at Lincoln's Inn Fields. The execution was said to have been conducted quite poorly by Ketch, who later wrote a letter of apology. Russell was exonerated by reversal of his attainder under William III of England. Russell did not confess; in fact, he pleaded that he knew of no plot to execute the king and was not party to any conspiracy to do so. He is recorded as having admitted conspiring to levy a war. Such a mini- invasion ultimately took place and was successful; simply put, Russell did not time his meetings correctly. He resigned himself rapidly to accept his fate with dignity while still stating his innocence, but was disappointed in the justice he had received, as laid out in his last letter before his death. Russell was later pardoned as having committed no part in a directly treasonous plot, casting the evidence as hearsay. The pardon remains as an official document. Whigs later commemorated him as a mistreated martyr, supposedly put to death in retaliation for his efforts to exclude James from succession to the crown.Lois G.

Belonging to the analytic and evidentialist schools of thought, Flew was most notable for his work related to the philosophy of religion. During the course of his career he taught at the universities of Oxford, Aberdeen, Keele and Reading, and at York University in Toronto. For much of his career Flew was known as a strong advocate of atheism, arguing that one should presuppose atheism until empirical evidence of a God surfaces. He also criticised the idea of life after death, the free will defence to the problem of evil, and the meaningfulness of the concept of God. In 2003 he was one of the signatories of the Humanist Manifesto III. However, in 2004 he changed his position, and stated that he now believed in the existence of an Intelligent Creator of the universe, shocking colleagues and fellow atheists. In order to further clarify his personal concept of God, Flew openly made an allegiance to Deism, more specifically a belief in the Aristotelian God, and dismissed on many occasions a hypothetical conversion to Christianity, Islam or any other religion. He stated that in keeping his lifelong commitment to go where the evidence leads, he now believed in the existence of a God. In 2007 a book outlining his reasons for changing his position, There is a God: How the World's Most Notorious Atheist Changed His Mind was written by Flew in collaboration with Roy Abraham Varghese. The book (and Flew's conversion to Deism) has been the subject of controversy, following an article in The New York Times Magazine alleging that Flew's intellect had declined due to senility, and that the book was primarily the work of Varghese; Flew himself specifically denied this, stating that the book represented his views; although he acknowledged that due to his age Varghese had done most of the actual work of writing the book. He was also known for the development of the no true Scotsman fallacy, and for his debate on retrocausality with Michael Dummett.  Life and career  Flew, the son of Methodist minister/theologian Robert Newton Flew (1886–1962) and his wife Winifred née Garrard (1887–1982), was born in London. He was educated at St Faith's School, Cambridge followed by Kingswood School, Bath. He is said to have concluded by the age of 15 that there was no God.http://www.fwponline.cc/v27n1/reviewone_editor.html During the Second World War he studied Japanese at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, and was a Royal Air Force intelligence officer. After a period with the Inter-Services Topographical Department in Oxford, he was posted to Bletchley Park in June 1944.Smith, Michael (2000), The Emperor's Codes, Bantam, p. 246 After the war, Flew achieved a first class degree in Literae Humaniores at St John's College, Oxford (1947). He also won the John Locke Scholarship in Mental Philosophy in the following year. Flew was a graduate student of Gilbert Ryle, prominent in ordinary language philosophy. Both Flew and Ryle were among many Oxford philosophers fiercely criticised in Ernest Gellner's book Words and Things (1959). A 1954 debate with Michael Dummett over backward causation was an early highlight in Flew's career. For a year, 1949–50, Flew was a lecturer in philosophy at Christ Church, Oxford.Who's Who, 1974, London : A. & C. Black, 1974, p. 1118 From 1950 to 1954 he was a lecturer at the University of Aberdeen, and from 1954 to 1971 he was a professor of philosophy at the University of Keele. He held a professorship at the University of Calgary, 1972–73. Between 1973 and 1983 he was professor of philosophy at the University of Reading. At this time, he developed one of his most famous arguments, the No true Scotsman fallacy in his 1975 book, Thinking About Thinking. Upon his retirement, Flew took up a half-time post for a few years at York University, Toronto. Politically Flew was a libertarian-leaning conservative and wrote articles for The Journal of Libertarian Studies. His name appears on letterheads into 1992 as a Vice- President of the Conservative Monday Club, and he held the same position in the Western Goals Institute.Labour Research, November 1988, p. 2. He was one of the signatories to a letter in The Times along with Lord Sudeley, Sir Alfred Sherman, and Dr. Harvey Ward, on behalf of the institute, \\"applauding Alfredo Cristiani's statesmanship\\" and calling for his government's success in defeating the Cuban and Nicaraguan-backed communist FMLN in El Salvador.The Times, 29 September 1989. Flew married on 28 June 1952. He had two daughters. Flew died on 8 April 2010, while nursed in an Extended Care Facility in Reading, England, suffering from dementia.. While an undergraduate, Flew attended the weekly meetings of C. S. Lewis's Socratic Club fairly regularly. Although he found Lewis to be \\"an eminently reasonable man\\" and \\"by far the most powerful Christian apologists for the sixty or more years following his founding of that club\\", he was not persuaded by Lewis's argument from morality as found in Mere Christianity. Flew also criticised several of the other philosophical proofs for God's existence. He concluded that the ontological argument in particular failed because it is based on the premise that the concept of Being can be derived from the concept of Goodness. Only the scientific forms of the teleological argument ultimately impressed Flew as decisive. During the time of his involvement in the Socratic Club, Flew also wrote the article \\"Theology and Falsification\\", which argued that claims about God were merely vacuous where they could not be tested for truth or falsehood. Though initially published in an undergraduate journal, the article came to be widely reprinted and discussed. Flew was also critical of the idea of life after death and the free will defence to the problem of evil. In 1998, he debated Christian philosopher William Lane Craig over the existence of God..  Atheism and deism = The Presumption of Atheism  One of Antony Flew's most influential professional works was his 1976 The Presumption of Atheism in which Flew forwarded the proposition that the question of God's existence should begin with the presumption of atheism: > \\"What I want to examine is the contention that the debate about the > existence of God should properly begin from the presumption of atheism, that > the onus of proof must lie upon the theist. The word 'atheism', however, has > in this contention to be construed unusually. Whereas nowadays the usual > meaning of 'atheist' in English is 'someone who asserts that there is no > such being as God, I want the word to be understood not positively but > negatively... in this interpretation an atheist becomes: not someone who > positively asserts the non-existence of God; but someone who is simply not a > theist. > The introduction of this new interpretation of the word 'atheism' may appear > to be a piece of perverse Humpty-Dumptyism, going arbitrarily against > established common usage. 'Whyever', it could be asked, don't you make it > not the presumption of atheism but the presumption of agnosticism? Flew's proposal to change his profession's use of the term atheism saw limited acceptance in the 20th century, but in the early 21st century Flew's negative sense of 'atheism' came to be forwarded more commonly. The impact of Flew's proposed negative atheism, which is often referred to today as 'weak atheism' or 'soft atheism', is illustrated by analytic Philosopher William Lane Craig's 2007 assessment that the presumption of atheism had become \\"one of the most commonly proffered justifications of atheism.\\" And BBC journalist William Crawley 2010 analysis: \\"The Presumption of Atheism (1976) made the case, now followed by today's new atheism, that atheism should be the ... default position\\". In recent debates, atheists often forward the Presumption of Atheism referring to atheism as the \\"default position\\" or has \\"no burden of proof\\" or asserting that the burden of proof rests solely on the theist. Revised viewsConversion to deism= On several occasions, starting in 2001, rumors circulated claiming that Flew had converted from atheism to deism. Flew denied these rumours on the Secular Web website.. In January 2004 Flew and Gary Habermas, his friend and philosophical adversary, took part in and conducted a dialogue on the resurrection at California Polytechnic State University – San Luis Obispo. During a couple of telephone discussions shortly after that dialogue, Flew explained to Habermas that he was considering becoming a theist. While Flew did not change his position at that time, he concluded that certain philosophical and scientific considerations were causing him to do some serious rethinking. He characterized his position as that of atheism standing in tension with several huge question marks. In a 2004 interview (published 9 December), Flew, then 81 years old, said that he had become a deist. In the article Flew states that he has renounced his long- standing espousal of atheism by endorsing a deism of the sort that Thomas Jefferson advocated (\\"While reason, mainly in the form of arguments to design, assures us that there is a God, there is no room either for any supernatural revelation of that God or for any transactions between that God and individual human beings\\"). Flew stated that \\"the most impressive arguments for God’s existence are those that are supported by recent scientific discoveries\\" and that \\"the argument to Intelligent Design is enormously stronger than it was when I first met it\\". The argument of ID is that evidenced objects and physical concepts are either too simple or too complex to be simply natural, whichever of the two extremes one chooses to be the hallmark of design by an outside intelligence. He also answered in the affirmative to Habermas's question, \\"So of the major theistic arguments, such as the cosmological, teleological, moral, and ontological, the only really impressive ones that you take to be decisive are the scientific forms of teleology?\\". He supported the idea of an Aristotelian God with \\"the characteristics of power and also intelligence\\", stating that the evidence for it was stronger than ever before. He rejected the idea of an afterlife, of God as the source of good (he explicitly states that God has created \\"a lot of\\" evil), and of the resurrection of Jesus as a historical fact, although he has allowed a short chapter arguing in favor of Joshua's/Jesus' resurrection to be added into his latest book. Flew was particularly hostile to Islam, and said it is \\"best described in a Marxian way as the uniting and justifying ideology of Arab imperialism.\\" In a December 2004 interview he said: \\"I'm thinking of a God very different from the God of the Christian and far and away from the God of Islam, because both are depicted as omnipotent Oriental despots, cosmic Saddam Husseins\\".. =Controversy over his position= In October 2004 (before the December publication of the Flew–Habermas interview), in a letter written to the internet atheist advocate Richard Carrier of the Secular Web Flew stated that he was a deist, and wrote \\"I think we need here a fundamental distinction between the God of Aristotle or Spinoza and the Gods of the Christian and the Islamic Revelations.\\" Flew also said: \\"My one and only piece of relevant evidence [for an Aristotelian God] is the apparent impossibility of providing a naturalistic theory of the origin from DNA of the first reproducing species... [In fact] the only reason which I have for beginning to think of believing in a First Cause god is the impossibility of providing a naturalistic account of the origin of the first reproducing organisms.\\" When asked in December 2004 by Duncan Crary of Humanist Network News if he still stood by the argument presented in The Presumption of Atheism, Flew replied he did and affirmed his position as deist: \\"I'm quite happy to believe in an inoffensive inactive god.\\" When asked by Crary whether or not he has kept up with the most recent science and theology, he responded with \\"Certainly not,\\" stating that there is simply too much to keep up with. Flew also denied that there was any truth to the rumours of 2001 and 2003 that he had converted to Christianity. His 2007 book There is a God (see below) revisited the question, however, and questioned contemporary models: \\"the latest work I have seen shows that the present physical universe gives too little time for these theories of abiogenesis to get the job done.\\". He added: \\"The philosophical question that has not been answered in origin-of-life studies is this: How can a universe of mindless matter produce beings with intrinsic ends, self- replication capabilities, and 'coded chemistry'? Here we are not dealing with biology, but an entirely different category of problem\\". However, in spring 2005 when atheist Raymond Bradley, emeritus professor of philosophy at Simon Fraser University and a member of the editorial board of The Open Society journal, wrote an open letter to Flew accusing him of not \\"check[ing] the veracity of Gerald Schroeder's claims before swallowing them whole,\\" Flew responded strongly to that charge in a letter published in the same journal in summer 2006, describing the content of Bradley's letter \\"extraordinarily offensive\\" and the accusation made by him as an \\"egregiously offensive charge\\"; he also implied that Bradley was a \\"secularist bigot,\\" and suggested that he should follow Socrates's advice (as scripted in Plato's Republic) of \\"follow[ing] the argument wherever it leads.\\". Other prominent atheists, such as Richard Dawkins, suggested Flew's deism was a form of God of the gaps. Flew said in December 2004:. =Restatement of position= A letter on evolution and theology which Flew published in the August/September 2004 issue of Philosophy Now magazine closed with, \\"Anyone who should happen to want to know what I myself now believe will have to wait until the publication, promised for early 2005, by Prometheus of Amherst, NY of the final edition of my God and Philosophy with a new introduction of it as 'an historical relic'.\\". The preface of God and Philosophy states that the publisher and Flew went through a total of four versions (each extensively peer-reviewed) before coming up with one that satisfied them both. The introduction raises ten matters that came about since the original 1966 edition. Flew states that any book to follow God and Philosophy will have to take into account these ideas when considering the philosophical case for the existence of God: # A novel definition of \\"God\\" by Richard Swinburne # The case for the existence of the Christian God by Swinburne in the book Is There a God? # The Church of England's change in doctrine on the eternal punishment of Hell # The question of whether there was only one Big Bang and if time began with it # The question of multiple universes # The fine-tuning argument # The question of whether there is a naturalistic account for the development of living matter from non-living matter # The question of whether there is a naturalistic account for non-reproducing living matter developing into a living creature capable of reproduction # The concept of an Intelligent Orderer as explained in the book The Wonder of the World: A Journey from Modern Science to the Mind of God by Roy Abraham Varghese # An extension of an Aristotelian/Deist concept of God that can be reached through natural theology, which was developed by David Conway. In an interview with Joan Bakewell for BBC Radio 4 in March 2005, Flew rejected the fine-tuning argument as a conclusive proof: \\"I don't think it proves anything but that it is entirely reasonable for people who already have a belief in a creating God to regard this as confirming evidence. And it's a point of argument which I think is very important – to see that what is reasonable for people to do in the face of new evidence depends on what they previously had good reason to believe.\\" He also said it appeared that there had been progress made regarding the naturalistic origins of DNA. However, he restated his deism, with the usual provisos that his God is not the God of any of the revealed religions.. In the same interview, Flew was asked whether he was retracting belief in an Aristotelian God, but answered no. One month later, Flew told Christianity Today that although he was not on the road to becoming a Christian convert, he reaffirmed his deism: \\"Since the beginning of my philosophical life I have followed the policy of Plato's Socrates: We must follow the argument wherever it leads.\\". In late 2006, Flew joined 11 other academics in urging the British government to teach intelligent design in the state schools.. In 2007, in an interview with Benjamin Wiker, Flew said again that his deism was the result of his \\"growing empathy with the insight of Einstein and other noted scientists that there had to be an Intelligence behind the integrated complexity of the physical Universe\\" and \\"my own insight that the integrated complexity of life itself – which is far more complex than the physical Universe – can only be explained in terms of an Intelligent Source.\\" He also restated that he was not a Christian theist.. Book with Varghese and authorship controversy In 2007, Flew published a book titled There is a God, which was listed as having Roy Abraham Varghese as its co-author. Shortly after the book was released, the New York Times published an article by historian of religion Mark Oppenheimer, who stated that Varghese had been almost entirely responsible for writing the book, and that Flew was in a serious state of mental decline, having great difficulty remembering key figures, ideas, and events relating to the debate covered in the book. His book praises several philosophers (like Brian Leftow, John Leslie and Paul Davies), but Flew failed to remember their work during Oppenheimer's interview. A further article by Anthony Gottlieb noted a strong difference in style between the passages giving Flew's biography, and those laying out the case for a god, with the latter including Americanisms such as \\"beverages\\", \\"vacation\\" and \\"candy\\". He came to the same conclusion as Oppenheimer, and stated that \\"Far from strengthening the case for the existence of God, [the book] rather weakens the case for the existence of Antony Flew\\".. Varghese replied with a letter disputing this view.. Flew later released a statement through his publisher stating: An audio commentary by William Lane Craig concurs with this position, but Richard Carrier disputed this view. In June 2008, Flew stated his position once again, in a letter to a fellow of the Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship. Christian writer Regis Nicoll claims that \\"Moreover, in a signed, handwritten letter (a copy of which I now have) sent to Roy Varghese, the legendary philosopher reaffirmed his conversion while criticising Oppenheimer for drawing attention away from the book’s central argument: the collapse of rationalism.\\" He argues that \\"Even Mark Oppenheimer described the ex-atheist 'flaunt[ing] his allegiance to deism' in May 2006 to a Christian audience at Biola University.\\" Perhaps most definitively, Christian apologist Anthony Horvath corresponded with Antony Flew before it was publicly known there would even be a book. In 2010, he published his letters. The letters contain Flew's description of the outline of the book, his Deism in the pattern of Einstein's, and his high praise of N.T. Wright's arguments for Christianity. All of these elements are present in the book. However, in 2014 the blog skeptical-science.com, following Oppenheimer's investigation on the authorship and content of the book, concluded that Varghese and a few other \\"ghostwriters\\" (evangelical pastors) psychologically manipulated Flew quite easily due to his vulnerability, old age and their persistent love-bombing, exploiting him, and presenting typical rough creationist arguments in favor of the Intelligent design theory and appraisal of Christianity that Flew would have never agreed upon: Awards Flew was awarded the Schlarbaum Prize by the Ludwig von Mises Institute for his \\"outstanding lifetime achievement in the cause of liberty.\\". Upon acceptance of the award in Auburn, Alabama, in September 2001, Flew delivered an address entitled \\"Locke versus Rawls on Equality.\\" Of his choice of topics, he stated \\"I am the first Englishman and the first professional philosopher to receive the Schlarbaum Prize. So it seems appropriate to begin by talking about the greatest English philosopher, John Locke.\\"Flew, Antony. \\"Locke versus Rawls on Equality\\" Mises. 24 October 2001. On 11 May 2006, Antony Flew accepted the second \\"Phillip E. Johnson Award for Liberty and Truth\\" from Biola University. The award, named for its first recipient, was given to Flew \\"for his lifelong commitment to free and open inquiry and to standing fast against intolerant assaults on freedom of thought and expression\\". When informed of his award, Flew remarked, \\"In light of my work and publications in this area and the criticism I’ve received for changing my position, I appreciate receiving this award\\". He was an honorary associate of the New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists. and a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. In 1985, Flew was awarded the In Praise of Reason Award the highest honor the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry awards. The award was presented by Chairman Paul Kurtz in London \\"'[I]n recognition of his long-standing contributions to the use of methods of critical inquiry, scientific evidence, and reason in evaluating claims to knowledge and solving social problems.\\" Works * A New Approach to Psychical Research (1953) * New Essays in Philosophical Theology (1955) editor with Alasdair MacIntyre * Essays in Conceptual Analysis (1956) * Hume's Philosophy of Belief (1961) * Logic And Language (1961) editor * . * . * Evolutionary Ethics (1967) * An Introduction to Western Philosophy: Ideas and Argument from Plato to Sartre (1971) * Body, Mind and Death (1973) * Crime or Disease (1973) * Thinking About Thinking (1975) * Sociology, Equality and Education: Philosophical Essays in Defence of A Variety of Differences (1976) A Dictionary of Philosophy (1979) editor, later edition with Stephen Priest * Philosophy, an Introduction (1979) * Libertarians versus Egalitarians (c. 1980) pamphlet * The Politics of Procrustes: contradictions of enforced equality (1981) * Darwinian Evolution (1984) * . * Examination not Attempted in Right Ahead, newspaper of the Conservative Monday Club, Conservative Party Conference edition, October 1985. * God: A Critical Inquiry (1986) – reprint of God and Philosophy (1966) with new introduction * David Hume: Philosopher of Moral Science (1986) Oxford: Basil Blackwell. * . * Did Jesus Rise From the Dead?

It contains Kashan's Fin Bath, where Amir Kabir, the Qajarid chancellor, was murdered by an assassin sent by King Nasereddin Shah in 1852. Completed in 1590, the Fin Garden is the oldest extant garden in Iran.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/gardenstovisit/3349964/The- worlds-50-most-beautiful-gardens-Asia-Africa-Australasia-and-the-Americas.html History The origins of the garden may be anterior to the Safavid period; some sources indicate that the garden has been relocated from another place, but no clear picture of it has been found. The settlements of the garden in its present form was built under the reign of Abbas I of Persia (1571-1629), as a traditional bagh near the village of Fin, located a few kilometres southwest of Kashan. The garden was developed further during the Safavid dynasty, until Abbas II of Persia (1633-1666). It was highly recognized during the reign of Fat′h Ali Shah Qajar and was considerably expanded. The garden subsequently suffered from neglect and was damaged several times until, in 1935, it was listed as a national property of Iran. On 2007, 8 September, Bagh-e Fin was submitted to the UNESCO's Tentative List. Unesco declared the garden a World Heritage Site on July 18, 2012. Structure The garden covers 2.3 hectares with a main yard surrounded by ramparts with four circular towers. In keeping with many of the Persian gardens of this era, the Fin Garden employs a great many water features. These were fed from a spring on a hillside behind the garden, and the water pressure was such that a large number of circulating pools and fountains could be constructed without the need for mechanical pumps. The garden contains numerous cypress trees and combines architectural features of the Safavid, Zandiyeh and Qajar periods.

Early life Powell was born in Knucklas, Radnorshire and may have been educated at Jesus College, Oxford. This notes that there is no written record of his attending Jesus College. He returned to Wales as a schoolmaster (1638–9) during which time he was converted to the Puritan understanding of the Gospel of Jesus Christ under the preaching of the Puritan Walter Cradock and through the writings of Richard Sibbs (1577–1635) and William Perkins (1558–1602). Preaching  In about 1639 Powell became an itinerant preacher and was arrested twice for preaching in various parts of Wales in 1640. However, he was not punished and during the Civil War he preached in and around London. In the same year he was the first minister of Pendref Chapel, Llanfyllin, which is said to be the oldest Welsh independent church in Powys. On 26 December 1641 he was preaching in Llanyre Parish Church in Rhos when he was forcibly removed by Hugh Lloyd (bishop) and twelve armed men and imprisoned. In 1646, when Parliament's victory was certain, Powell returned to Wales having received a \\"certificate of character\\" from the Westminster Assembly, although he had refused to be ordained by the Presbyterians. With a salary granted to him by parliament he resumed his itinerant preaching in Wales. Advisor to Parliament and controversy  In 1650 Parliament appointed a commission for the better propagation and preaching of the gospel in Wales, with Powell acting as one of the principal advisers of this body. For three years he was actively employed in removing from their parishes those ministers whom he regarded as incompetent. During this time Powell was involved in a controversy with Welsh poet Katherine Philips. Powell had published a poem celebrating the regicide of Charles I, and Philips responded with hers, Upon the Double Murder of King Charles in Answer to a Libellous Rhyme made by V.P. This was one of her first forays into political writing, and she is one of the first women to do so in literature. When it became apparent the poem may be published, and so embarrass her husband James Philips, she was forced to apologise. She did so in the form of another poem but whilst distancing herself from the views of her husband she reinforced her criticism of Powell.Shopland, Norena 'The Welsh Sappho' from Forbidden Lives: LGBT stories from Wales,Seren Books, 2017 Preaching in London and royal plot In 1653 Powell returned to London to preach at St Ann Blackfriars after the death of their pastor, William Gouge. Having denounced Cromwell for accepting the office of Lord Protector, he was imprisoned. At the Restoration, on 18 July 1660, the Council of King Charles II issued an order to Sir Matthew Price, High Sheriff of Montgomeryshire to take into safe custody Vavasour Powell (described as, \\"a most factious and dangerous minister\\"), Sir Richard Saltonstall, and Richard Price of Aberbechan.Green, Mary Ann Everett, Ed. Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, of the Reign of Charles II, 1660-1661 Vol. I (1860) London: Longman, Green, Longman, & Roberts, p. 123 According to Price's letters to Secretary Nicholas, Vavasour Powell, Saltonstall and Price were concerned in a plot to depose King Charles II. Letters were found in their possession indicating the plot extended all the way to London. By 2 August 1660 Vavasour Powell was taken into custody, while Sir Richard Saltonstall and Capt. Richard Price \\"had left these parts\\" (Montgomeryshire). Powell remained in prison for seven years. He was set free in 1667, but in the following year he was again imprisoned and was in custody until his death on 27 October 1670. Powell is buried at Bunhill Fields cemetery in London. Work Powell wrote eleven books and some hymns but his chief gifts were those of a preacher. During his ministry he preached before the Lord Mayor of London (1649), Parliament (1650) and as an ardent defender of Calvinism held disputations with popular Arminians of his day. While remaining a relatively minor figure in seventeenth-century Puritan history since his death, Powell's place in the Puritan movement has been reassessed in recent years. The twentieth-century Welsh theologian R. Tudur Jones wrote of Powell: > Vavasor Powell deserves better of historians than to be dismissed as a > millenarian enthusiast. In many ways, Powell was the most striking > personality amongst the Welsh Puritans. That estimation has been heeded as Powell has been the subject of doctoral dissertations as well as several peer reviewed papers and presentations. Powell has emerged as a leading case study for the right wing elements of Seventeenth Century English Non Conformity and their relationship to the larger Puritan movement.

It belongs to the broader field of space geodesy. Traditional astronomical geodesy is not commonly considered a part of satellite geodesy, although there is considerable overlap between the techniques. The main goals of satellite geodesy are: # Determination of the figure of the Earth, positioning, and navigation (geometric satellite geodesy) # Determination of geoid, Earth's gravity field and its temporal variations (dynamical satellite geodesy or satellite physical geodesy) # Measurement of geodynamical phenomena, such as crustal dynamics and polar motion Satellite geodetic data and methods can be applied to diverse fields such as navigation, hydrography, oceanography and geophysics. Satellite geodesy relies heavily on orbital mechanics. History=First steps (1957-1970) Satellite geodesy began shortly after the launch of Sputnik in 1957. Observations of Explorer 1 and Sputnik 2 in 1958 allowed for an accurate determination of Earth's flattening. The 1960s saw the launch of the Doppler satellite Transit-1B and the balloon satellites Echo 1, Echo 2, and PAGEOS. The first dedicated geodetic satellite was ANNA-1B, a collaborative effort between NASA, the DoD, and other civilian agencies. ANNA-1B carried the first of the US Army's SECOR (Sequential Collation of Range) instruments. These missions led to the accurate determination of the leading spherical harmonic coefficients of the geopotential, the general shape of the geoid, and linked the world's geodetic datums. Soviet military satellites undertook geodesic missions to assist in ICBM targeting in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Toward the World Geodetic System (1970-1990) Worldwide BC-4 camera geometric satellite triangulation network The Transit satellite system was used extensively for Doppler surveying, navigation, and positioning. Observations of satellites in the 1970s by worldwide triangulation networks allowed for the establishment of the World Geodetic System. The development of GPS by the United States in the 1980s allowed for precise navigation and positioning and soon became a standard tool in surveying. In the 1980s and 1990s satellite geodesy began to be used for monitoring of geodynamic phenomena, such as crustal motion, Earth rotation, and polar motion. Modern Era (1990-present) GRACE The 1990s were focused on the development of permanent geodetic networks and reference frames. Dedicated satellites were launched to measure Earth's gravity field in the 2000s, such as CHAMP, GRACE, and GOCE. Measurement techniques DORIS, SLR, GPS, and altimetry. Techniques of satellite geodesy may be classified by instrument platform: A satellite may #be observed with ground-based instruments (Earth-to-space-methods), #carry an instrument or sensor as part of its payload to observe the Earth (space-to-Earth methods), #or use its instruments to track or be tracked by another satellite (space-to-space methods). Earth-to-space methods (satellite tracking)Geodetic use of GPS/GNSS= Global navigation satellite systems are dedicated radio positioning services, which can locate a receiver to within a few meters. The most prominent system, GPS, consists of a constellation of 31 satellites (as of December 2013) in high, 12-hour circular orbits, distributed in six planes with 55° inclinations. The principle of location is based on trilateration. Each satellite transmits a precise ephemeris with information on its own position and a message containing the exact time of transmission. The receiver compares this time of transmission with its own clock at the time of reception and multiplies the difference by the speed of light to obtain a \\"pseudorange.\\" Four pseudoranges are needed to obtain the precise time and the receiver's position within a few meters. More sophisticated methods, such as real-time kinematic (RTK) can yield positions to within a few millimeters. In geodesy, GNSS is used as an economical tool for surveying and time transfer. It is also used for monitoring Earth's rotation, polar motion, and crustal dynamics. The presence of the GPS signal in space also makes it suitable for orbit determination and satellite-to-satellite tracking. :Examples: GPS, GLONASS, Galileo =Doppler techniques= Doppler positioning involves recording the Doppler shift of a radio signal of stable frequency emitted from a satellite as the satellite approaches and recedes from the observer. The observed frequency depends on the radial velocity of the satellite relative to the observer, which is constrained by orbital mechanics. If the observer knows the orbit of the satellite, then recording the Doppler profile determines the observer's position. Conversely, if the observer's position is precisely known, then the orbit of the satellite can be determined and used to study the Earth's gravity. In DORIS, the ground station emits the signal and the satellite receives. :Examples: Transit, DORIS =Passive optical tracking= In optical tracking, the satellite can be used as a very high target for triangulation and can be used to ascertain the geometric relationship between multiple observing stations. Optical tracking with the BC-4, PC-1000, MOTS, or Baker Nunn cameras consisted of photographic observations of a satellite, or flashing light on the satellite, against a background of stars. The stars, whose positions were accurately determined, provided a framework on the photographic plate or film for a determination of precise directions from camera station to satellite. Geodetic positioning work with cameras was usually performed with one camera observing simultaneously with one or more other cameras. Camera systems are weather dependent and that is one major reason why they fell out of use by the 1980s. ANNA 1B track on photography taken by Santiago (Chile) MOTS station on November 11, 1962 :Examples: PAGEOS, Project Echo, ANNA 1B =Laser ranging= In satellite laser ranging (SLR) a global network of observation stations measure the round trip time of flight of ultrashort pulses of light to satellites equipped with retroreflectors. This provides instantaneous range measurements of millimeter level precision which can be accumulated to provide accurate orbit parameters, gravity field parameters (from the orbit perturbations), Earth rotation parameters, tidal Earth's deformations, coordinates and velocities of SLR stations, and other substantial geodetic data. Satellite laser ranging is a proven geodetic technique with significant potential for important contributions to scientific studies of the Earth/Atmosphere/Oceans system. It is the most accurate technique currently available to determine the geocentric position of an Earth satellite, allowing for the precise calibration of radar altimeters and separation of long-term instrumentation drift from secular changes in ocean surface topography. Satellite laser ranging contributes to the definition of the international terrestrial reference frames by providing the information about the scale and the origin of the reference frame, the so-called geocenter coordinates. :Example: LAGEOS Space-to-Earth methodsAltimetry= This graph shows the rise in global sea level (in millimeters) measured by the NASA/CNES ocean altimeter mission TOPEX/Poseidon (on the left) and its follow- on mission Jason-1. Image credit: University of Colorado Satellites such as Seasat (1978) and TOPEX/Poseidon (1992-2006) used advanced dual-band radar altimeters to measure the height of the Earth's surface (sea, ice, and terrestrial surfaces) from a spacecraft. Jason-1 has begun in 2001, Jason-2 in 2008 and Jason-3 in January 2016. That measurement, coupled with orbital elements (possibly augmented by GPS), enables determination of the terrain. The two different wavelengths of radio waves used permit the altimeter to automatically correct for varying delays in the ionosphere. Spaceborne radar altimeters have proven to be superb tools for mapping ocean-surface topography, the hills and valleys of the sea surface. These instruments send a microwave pulse to the ocean's surface and record the time it takes to return. A microwave radiometer corrects any delay that may be caused by water vapor in the atmosphere. Other corrections are also required to account for the influence of electrons in the ionosphere and the dry air mass of the atmosphere. Combining these data with the precise location of the spacecraft makes it possible to determine sea-surface height to within a few centimeters (about one inch). The strength and shape of the returning signal also provides information on wind speed and the height of ocean waves. These data are used in ocean models to calculate the speed and direction of ocean currents and the amount and location of heat stored in the ocean, which in turn reveals global climate variations. Laser altimetry A laser altimeter uses the round-trip flight-time of a beam of light at optical or infrared wavelengths to determine the spacecraft's altitude or, conversely, the ground topography. :Examples: ICESat, MOLA. Radar altimetry A radar altimeter uses the round-trip flight-time of a microwave pulse between the satellite and the Earth's surface to determine the distance between the spacecraft and the surface. From this distance or height, the local surface effects such as tides, winds and currents are removed to obtain the satellite height above the geoid. With a precise ephemeris available for the satellite, the geocentric position and ellipsoidal height of the satellite are available for any given observation time. It is then possible to compute the geoid height by subtracting the measured altitude from the ellipsoidal height. This allows direct measurement of the geoid, since the ocean surface closely follows the geoid. The difference between the ocean surface and the actual geoid gives ocean surface topography. :Examples: Seasat, Geosat, TOPEX/Poseidon, ERS-1, ERS-2, Jason-1, Jason-2, Envisat, SWOT (satellite) =Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)= Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. This geodetic method uses two or more synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images to generate maps of surface deformation or digital elevation, using differences in the phase of the waves returning to the satellite. The technique can potentially measure centimetre-scale changes in deformation over timespans of days to years. It has applications for geophysical monitoring of natural hazards, for example earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also in structural engineering, in particular monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. :Example: Seasat, TerraSAR-X Space-to-space methodsGravity gradiometry= A gravity gradiometer can independently determine the components of the gravity vector on a real-time basis. A gravity gradient is simply the spatial derivative of the gravity vector. The gradient can be thought of as the rate of change of a component of the gravity vector as measured over a small distance. Hence, the gradient can be measured by determining the difference in gravity at two close but distinct points. This principle is embodied in several recent moving-base instruments. The gravity gradient at a point is a tensor, since it is the derivative of each component of the gravity vector taken in each sensitive axis. Thus, the value of any component of the gravity vector can be known all along the path of the vehicle if gravity gradiometers are included in the system and their outputs are integrated by the system computer. An accurate gravity model will be computed in real-time and a continuous map of normal gravity, elevation, and anomalous gravity will be available. :Example: GOCE =Satellite-to-satellite tracking= This technique uses satellites to track other satellites. There are a number of variations which may be used for specific purposes such as gravity field investigations and orbit improvement. * A high altitude satellite may act as a relay from ground tracking stations to a low altitude satellite. In this way, low altitude satellites may be observed when they are not accessible to ground stations. In this type of tracking, a signal generated by a tracking station is received by the relay satellite and then retransmitted to a lower altitude satellite. This signal is then returned to the ground station by the same path. * Two low altitude satellites can track one another observing mutual orbital variations caused by gravity field irregularities. A prime example of this is GRACE. * Several high altitude satellites with accurately known orbits, such as GPS satellites, may be used to fix the position of a low altitude satellite. These examples present a few of the possibilities for the application of satellite-to-satellite tracking. Satellite-to-satellite tracking data was first collected and analyzed in a high-low configuration between ATS-6 and GEOS-3. The data was studied to evaluate its potential for both orbit and gravitational model refinement. :Example: GRACE GNSS tracking  :Examples: CHAMP, GOCE List of geodetic satellites * ANNA-1B *Beidou *BLITS *CHAMP *Diadème *Echo *Envisat *ERS-1 *ERS-2 *Etalon *Experimental Geodetic Payload \\"Ajisai\\" *Explorer program *Galileo *Geo-IK-2 *GEOS-3 *Geosat *Geosat Follow-On *GFZ-1 *GLONASS *GRACE *GOCE *GPS *ICESat-1 *ICESat-2 *LAGEOS *LARES *Larets *Laser Reflecting Equipment (LRE) *PAGEOS *Seasat *Starlette *Stella *TOPEX/Poseidon *TRANSIT *WESTPAC See also * Geodetic astronomy ReferencesFurther reading * Smith, David E. and Turcotte, Donald L.

Battle of the Somme in 1916 (red – British front line, blue – German fortifications). During the First World War, Beaumont-Hamel was close to the front line, near many attacks, especially during the Battle of the Somme, one of the largest allied offensives of the war. By 1918 the village had been almost totally destroyed. The banks of white chalk at Beaumont Hamel led to a sector of British trenches being nicknamed \\"White City\\". To the west of the village was Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt, one of the sites of the mines exploded on the first day of the Battle of the Somme.

Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are. Publish–subscribe is a sibling of the message queue paradigm, and is typically one part of a larger message-oriented middleware system. Most messaging systems support both the pub/sub and message queue models in their API, e.g. Java Message Service (JMS). This pattern provides greater network scalability and a more dynamic network topology, with a resulting decreased flexibility to modify the publisher and the structure of the published data. Message filtering In the publish-subscribe model, subscribers typically receive only a subset of the total messages published. The process of selecting messages for reception and processing is called filtering. There are two common forms of filtering: topic-based and content- based. In a topic-based system, messages are published to \\"topics\\" or named logical channels. Subscribers in a topic-based system will receive all messages published to the topics to which they subscribe. The publisher is responsible for defining the topics to which subscribers can subscribe. In a content-based system, messages are only delivered to a subscriber if the attributes or content of those messages matches constraints defined by the subscriber. The subscriber is responsible for classifying the messages. Some systems support a hybrid of the two; publishers post messages to a topic while subscribers register content-based subscriptions to one or more topics. Topologies In many pub/sub systems, publishers post messages to an intermediary message broker or event bus, and subscribers register subscriptions with that broker, letting the broker perform the filtering. The broker normally performs a store and forward function to route messages from publishers to subscribers. In addition, the broker may prioritize messages in a queue before routing. Subscribers may register for specific messages at build time, initialization time or runtime. In GUI systems, subscribers can be coded to handle user commands (e.g., click of a button), which corresponds to build time registration. Some frameworks and software products use XML configuration files to register subscribers. These configuration files are read at initialization time. The most sophisticated alternative is when subscribers can be added or removed at runtime. This latter approach is used, for example, in database triggers, mailing lists, and RSS. The Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware does not use a broker in the middle. Instead, each publisher and subscriber in the pub/sub system shares meta-data about each other via IP multicast. The publisher and the subscribers cache this information locally and route messages based on the discovery of each other in the shared cognizance. In effect, brokerless architectures require publish/subscribe system to construct an overlay network which allows efficient decentralized routing from publishers to subscribers. It was shown by Jon Kleinberg that efficient decentralised routing requires Navigable Small-World topologies. Such Small-World topologies are usually implemented by decentralized or federated publish/subscribe systems. Locality-aware publish/subscribe systems construct Small-World topologies that route subscriptions through short-distance and low-cost links thereby reducing subscription delivery times. History One of the earliest publicly described pub/sub systems was the \\"news\\" subsystem of the Isis Toolkit, described at the 1987 Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Symposium on Operating Systems Principles conference (SOSP '87), in a paper \\"Exploiting Virtual Synchrony in Distributed Systems. 123–138\\". Advantages=Loose coupling Publishers are loosely coupled to subscribers, and need not even know of their existence. With the topic being the focus, publishers and subscribers are allowed to remain ignorant of system topology. Each can continue to operate as per normal independently of the other. In the traditional tightly coupled client–server paradigm, the client cannot post messages to the server while the server process is not running, nor can the server receive messages unless the client is running. Many pub/sub systems decouple not only the locations of the publishers and subscribers but also decouple them temporally. A common strategy used by middleware analysts with such pub/sub systems is to take down a publisher to allow the subscriber to work through the backlog (a form of bandwidth throttling). Scalability Pub/sub provides the opportunity for better scalability than traditional client-server, through parallel operation, message caching, tree-based or network-based routing, etc. However, in certain types of tightly coupled, high-volume enterprise environments, as systems scale up to become data centers with thousands of servers sharing the pub/sub infrastructure, current vendor systems often lose this benefit; scalability for pub/sub products under high load in these contexts is a research challenge. Outside of the enterprise environment, on the other hand, the pub/sub paradigm has proven its scalability to volumes far beyond those of a single data center, providing Internet-wide distributed messaging through web syndication protocols such as RSS and Atom. These syndication protocols accept higher latency and lack of delivery guarantees in exchange for the ability for even a low-end web server to syndicate messages to (potentially) millions of separate subscriber nodes. Disadvantages The most serious problems with pub/sub systems are a side- effect of their main advantage: the decoupling of publisher from subscriber. Message delivery issues A pub/sub system must be designed carefully to be able to provide stronger system properties that a particular application might require, such as assured delivery. * The broker in a pub/sub system may be designed to deliver messages for a specified time, but then stop attempting delivery, whether or not it has received confirmation of successful receipt of the message by all subscribers. A pub/sub system designed in this way cannot guarantee delivery of messages to any applications that might require such assured delivery. Tighter coupling of the designs of such a publisher and subscriber pair must be enforced outside of the pub/sub architecture to accomplish such assured delivery (e.g. by requiring the subscriber to publish receipt messages). * A publisher in a pub/sub system may assume that a subscriber is listening, when in fact it is not. A factory may utilize a pub/sub system where equipment can publish problems or failures to a subscriber that displays and logs those problems. If the logger fails (crashes), equipment problem publishers won't necessarily receive notice of the logger failure, and error messages will not be displayed or recorded by any equipment on the pub/sub system. This is also a design challenge for alternative messaging architectures, such as a client/server system. In a client/server system, when an error logger fails, the system will receive an indication of the error logger (server) failure. However, the client/server system will have to deal with that failure by having redundant logging servers online, or by dynamically spawning fallback logging servers. This adds complexity to the client and server designs, as well as to the client/server architecture as a whole. However, in a pub/sub system, redundant logging subscribers that are exact duplicates of the existing logger can be added to the system to increase logging reliability without any impact to any other equipment on the system. In a pub/sub system, the feature of assured error message logging can be added incrementally, subsequent to implementing the basic functionality of equipment problem message logging. The pub/sub pattern scales well for small networks with a small number of publisher and subscriber nodes and low message volume. However, as the number of nodes and messages grows, the likelihood of instabilities increases, limiting the maximum scalability of a pub/sub network. Example throughput instabilities at large scales include: * Load surges—periods when subscriber requests saturate network throughput followed by periods of low message volume (underutilized network bandwidth) * Slowdowns—as more and more applications use the system (even if they are communicating on separate pub/sub channels) the message volume flow to an individual subscriber will slow For pub/sub systems that use brokers (servers), the argument for a broker to send messages to a subscriber is in-band, and can be subject to security problems. Brokers might be fooled into sending notifications to the wrong client, amplifying denial of service requests against the client. Brokers themselves could be overloaded as they allocate resources to track created subscriptions. Even with systems that do not rely on brokers, a subscriber might be able to receive data that it is not authorized to receive. An unauthorized publisher may be able to introduce incorrect or damaging messages into the pub/sub system. This is especially true with systems that broadcast or multicast their messages. Encryption (e.g. Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)) can prevent unauthorized access, but cannot prevent damaging messages from being introduced by authorized publishers. Architectures other than pub/sub, such as client/server systems, are also vulnerable to authorized message senders that behave maliciously.

The \\"Green Ribbon\\" was the badge of the Levellers in the English Civil Wars, in which many of them had fought, and was an overt reminder of the radical origins of the club's loyalties. Meetings and name The club had its meeting-place at the King's Head tavern at Chancery Lane End, so was known as the King's Head Club. It seems to have been founded about the year 1675 as a resort for men of the political faction hostile to the king's court. As these associates were in the habit of wearing in their hats a bow, or bob, of green ribbon, as a distinguishing badge useful for the purpose of mutual recognition in street brawls, the name of the club was changed, about 1679, to the Green Ribbon Club. The King's Head Tavern, described by North as over against [meaning opposite] the Inner Temple Gate, was at the corner of Fleet Street and Chancery Lane, on the east side of the latter thoroughfare. Membership The frequenters of the club were the extreme faction of the country party, the men who supported Titus Oates, and who were concerned in the Rye House Plot and Monmouth's rebellion. Roger North tells us that they admitted all strangers that were confidingly introduced, for it was a main end of their institutions to make proselytes, especially of the raw estated youth newly come to town. According to Dryden (Absalom and Achitophel) drinking was the chief attraction, and the members talked and organized sedition over their cups. Thomas Dangerfield supplied the court with a list of forty-eight members of the Green Ribbon Club in 1679; and although Dangerfield's numerous perjuries make his unsupported evidence worthless, it receives confirmation as regards several names from a list given to James II by Nathan Wade in 1685 (Harleian Manuscript 6845,), while a number of more eminent personages are mentioned in The Cabal, a satire published in 1680, as also frequenting the club. From such sources it appears that the Duke of Monmouth himself, and statesmen like Halifax, Shaftesbury, Buckingham, Macclesfield, Cavendish, Bedford, Grey of Warke, were among those who fraternized at the King's Head Tavern with third-rate writers such as Scroop, Mulgrave and Shadwell; with remnants of the Cromwellian régime like Lord Falconbridge, John Claypole and Henry Ireton (two sons-in-law and a grandson of the old Protector);Henry Ireton (c.1652–1711) was the son of the Cromwellian General Henry Ireton and Bridget a daughter of Oliver Cromwell. with such profligates as Lord Howard of Escrick and Sir Henry Blount; and with scoundrels of the type of Dangerfield and Oates. An allusion to Dangerfield, notorious among his other crimes and treacheries for a seditious paper found in a meal-tub, is found in connection with the club in The Loyal Subject's Litany, one of the innumerable satires of the period, in which occur the lines: :\\"From the dark-lanthorn Plot, and the Green Ribbon Club From brewing sedition in a sanctified Tub, Libera nos, Domine\\". Activism The club was the headquarters of the Whig opposition to the court, and its members were active promoters of conspiracy and sedition. The president was either Lord Shaftesbury or Sir Robert Peyton, MP for Middlesex, who later turned informer. The Green Ribbon Club served both as a debating society and an intelligence department for the Whig faction. Questions under discussion in parliament were here threshed out by the members over their tobacco and ale; the latest news from Westminster or the city was retailed in the tavern, for some or others were continually coming and going, says Roger North, to import or export news and stories. Slander of the court or the Tories was invented in the club and sedulously spread over the town, and measures were concerted there for pushing on the Exclusion Bill, or for promoting the pretensions of the Duke of Monmouth. The popular credulity as to Catholic outrages in the days of the Popish Plot was stimulated by the scandalmongers of the club, whose members went about in silk armour, supposed to be bulletproof, in which any man dressed up was as safe as a house, says North, for it was impossible to strike him for laughing; while in their pockets, for street and crowd-work, they carried the weapon of offence invented by Stephen College and known as the Protestant Flail. The genius of Shaftesbury found in the Green Ribbon Club the means of constructing the first systematized political organization in England. North relates that every post conveyed the news and tales legitimated there, as also the malign constructions of all the good actions of the government, especially to places where elections were depending, to shape men's characters into fit qualifications to be chosen or rejected. In the general election of January and February 1679 the Whig interest throughout the country was managed and controlled by a committee sitting at the club in Chancery Lane. The club's organizing activity was also notably effective in the agitation of the Petitioners in 1679. This celebrated movement was engineered from the Green Ribbon Club with all the skill and energy of a modern caucus. The petitions were prepared in London and sent down to every part of the country, where paid canvassers took them from house to house collecting signatures with an air of authority that made refusal difficult. The great pope-burning processions in 1680 and 1681, on the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's accession, were also organized by the clubIn fact, the actual Pope in Rome, Pope Innocent XI, was a staunch foe of the French King Louis XIV, and far from promoting the Duke of York gaining the throne, he would ten years later openly endorse the Glorious Revolution.. They ended by the lighting of a huge bonfire in front of the club windows; and as they proved an effective means of inflaming the religious passions of the populace, it was at the Green Ribbon Club that the mobile vulgus first received the nickname of the mob. The activity of the club was, however, short-lived. Decline The failure to carry the Exclusion Bill, one of the favourite projects of the faction, was a blow to its influence, which declined rapidly after the flight of Shaftesbury, the confiscation of the city of London's charter, and the discovery of the Rye House Plot, in which many of its members were implicated. In 1685 John Ayloffe, who was found to have been a dubber at the King's Head Tavern and a green-ribbon man, was executed in front of the premises on the spot where the pope-burning bonfires had been kindled; and although the tavern was still in existence in the time of Queen Anne, the Green Ribbon Club which made it famous did not survive the accession of James II.

The suburb was developed during the 1890s and is an administrative locality within the City of Bayswater (having been mostly within the City of Stirling until 1998), bordered by the suburbs of Mount Lawley, East Perth and Bayswater. Maylands railway station provides easy access to the City centre and beyond. The railway line was originally built in the 1880s, and the railway station was extensively refurbished in 2000. Recently a shared bicycle / pedestrian path was built to link Maylands with neighbouring suburbs via the shoreline of the Swan River. There is also a small yacht club and a golf course. Maylands was once a source of clay for brick and tile making at Maylands Brickworks, and the pits from these activities are now part of a golf course and residential area. It was home to Perth's main airport which serviced all kinds of aircraft and even flying boats until the early 1960s, when the airport moved to Perth Airport. The facilities were then converted to a training area for the Western Australian Police Service.  Revitalisation  In December 2009, the City of Bayswater endorsed the Maylands Activity Centre Urban Design Framework following widespread community consultation. The Urban Design Framework provides the strategic direction for the future of the Maylands town centre. This document has been instrumental in guiding the ongoing revitalisation of the Maylands town centre. Over recent years, Maylands' revitalisation has gathered significant momentum, with a variety of new developments and businesses bringing new residents and vibrancy to the town centre. New bars, cafés and restaurants, along with gourmet food and retail outlets have all contributed to an ongoing transformation of the Maylands town centre into a lively, diverse and inclusive destination. Maylands continues to evolve as a cultural and creative hub, with the relocation of the Western Australian Ballet to the former Western Australian Institute for the Blind building on Whatley Crescent in 2012. Estudio Nuevo, Studio 281, Swallow Bar and the Maylands Hawkers Markets each provide a variety of music, performance, dance, artistic, cultural and culinary experiences that exemplify Maylands' unique creative and community flavour.  Culture and arts = Western Australian Ballet  The West Australian Ballet Centre is situated on the historical site of the former Blind Institute in Maylands. The history of the building site dates back to 1897 when the Victoria Institute and the Industrial School for the Blind was developed as a part of the celebrations for the 60th year of Queen Victoria’s reign. This magnificent building has become a symbol that illustrates Perth’s short history. With its high ceilings, rustic wooded floors, classical charm and character, the building sets a perfect tone for the West Australian Ballet. The building’s disposition provides the artistic team with a creative and innovative backdrop to aid in the creation of world class productions.  Lyric Lane  The recent Council approval of the Lyric Lane Bar and Café will see the establishment of a purpose-built venue consisting of a bar, cafe and a live music basement, which will provide for new cultural pursuits in the town centre. The project is now open.  WA Youth Jazz Orchestra  It has recently been announced that the Western Australian Youth Jazz Orchestra will soon take up residence in the old Maylands Hall at the corner of Eighth Avenue and Guildford Road.  Community = Community groups A variety of community groups including Creative Maylands, Local Arts and Community Events Inc (LACE), Maylands Residents and Ratepayers Association, Maylands Historical and Peninsula Association (Inc) and Maylands Business Association provide a supportive backbone of active and passionate community members who seek to ensure that the values of the Maylands people are reflected both in its present and future. = Local Arts and Community Events Inc (LACE) = LACE is the not-for-profit organiser of the Maylands Hawker Markets, and new organiser of the Maylands Street Festival. LACE is about creating free to attend, inclusive community events to help reconnect community. = Creative Maylands = Since October 2010, Creative Maylands has been managing and supporting activities that creatively enrich the Maylands neighbourhood. They aim to connect people and ideas to help make Maylands a great place to live, work, and visit. = Maylands Residents and Ratepayers Association = Maylands Business Association = The association has a strong group of local businesses working together to improve Maylands and make it a destination venue for the community and the promotion of business interests, The group is active with Council and State Government to help form policies consistent to their vision for Maylands. = Maylands Historical and Peninsula Association (Inc) = Maylands Historical and Peninsula Association (Inc) was formed in October 1992 at a public meeting held in the Maylands Library. They were promoted by the Maylands Ratepayers and Residents Association and declared the Maylands Historical Society by the Mayor of the City of Stirling. The Association was officially registered on 1 December 1992, as the Maylands Historical Society Incorporated. On 5 June 2003, they were renamed the Maylands Historical and Peninsula Association Inc. to reflect their caretaker work at the Old Peninsula Hotel in Maylands, in addition to other historical work.  Community facilities  RISE = The City of Bayswater's RISE (Recreation, Information, Socialising and Entertainment) was opened in July 2011 and replaced the former Alma Venville Centre with a larger, more contemporary facility. The RISE is a multi purpose community centre that includes a library, gymnasium, cafe, creche, dry courts, function rooms, meeting rooms and a community hall. = Maylands Yacht Club = The Maylands Yacht Club is located on the Swan River on the Maylands foreshore. The MYC is a family oriented club, with a strong emphasis on enjoyment and helping those who want to learn to sail. The Club sails a variety of classes from the single handed Laser, Sabre and Spiral, to a number of two-handed dinghies including Mirrors and 125s, and the popular trailer-sailer Hartley TS 16. = Maylands Tennis Club = The Maylands Tennis Club is a boutique grass court club in a secluded location on the Maylands Peninsula, overlooking the Swan River. The Club operates all year round, with 14 grass courts and 3 hard courts (four grass courts over the winter months). The club provides for competitive tennis for players of a wide range of abilities and is renowned for its social activities year-round. = Maylands Cricket Club = The Maylands Cricket Club is based at De Lacy Reserve. A small community club who function throughout the summer months. Founded in 1958/59 as the Peninsula Cricket Club, before changing to Maylands Peninsula Cricket Club in the 70's before finally being called Maylands Cricket Club in 1989.  Heritage and history  In 1896 the name \\"Maylands\\" was first used to identify the area, appearing on a poster advertising a land auction. However the exact reason how the area got its name is something of a mystery. One theory is that Mephan Ferguson (owner of the local foundry) was responsible for naming the area, in honour of his aunt and daughter whom were both named May. Another theory is the area was named by Edgar. W. Hamer (Golds Estates of Australia) after he inspected land in the locality sometime in the month of May.  Historic Peninsula Hotel  Peninsula Hotel Maylands dawn The Peninsula Hotel is located on Railway Parade in Maylands, Perth. The hotel was built in 1906 by well known building contractor, Friederich Wilhelm Gustave Liebe. Old Maylands Aerodrome Maylands Airport 1935 The Maylands Aerodrome was built at Maylands to support West Australian Airways Ltd, which flew the first commercial air service in Australia (before Qantas). Maylands Airport was where Charles Kingsford-Smith made his landing to complete the first non-stop flight across Australia. On 8 August 1928, the \\"Southern Cross\\" took off from Point Cook near Melbourne and set course for Perth, a distance of over . The first part of the flight Kingsford-Smith described as rather dull, while the second part was made thoroughly unpleasant by a cloud cover their heavy machine couldn't rise out of. For hours they endured the bitter cold and when daylight finally came, they discovered that they had drifted off course to Bunbury, to the south. After their arrival at Maylands airport they found that summer rains had turned the field more or less into a swamp. During World War II, Maylands Airfield was requisitioned by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). From February 1942, it was also used by the United States Army Air Forces for refuelling and aircraft ferrying purposes. Between 6 April 1942 and 5 August 1943, No. 35 Squadron, flying Avro Ansons, was based at Maylands to transport supplies and passengers to Allied units throughout Western Australia, as well as supporting the Royal Australian Navy and the Australian Army.

Similar titles include great king and king of kings. The high kings of history usually ruled over lands of cultural unity; thus high kings differentiate from emperors who control culturally different lands, and feudal monarchs, where subordinates assume lesser positions. High kings can be chosen by lesser rulers through elections, or be put into power by force through conquest of weaker kingdoms. High kingship In history and literature, high kings may be found where there is a high degree of cultural unity, along with sufficient political fragmentation that the high king's subordinates style themselves kings. In this respect, high kingships frequently differ from empires, which are culturally as well as politically heterogeneous, as well as from feudal monarchies, where the subordinate rulers take lesser titles (such as duke or count) and may be, at least in theory, subject to appointment and dismissal by the sovereign. In this model, a high king might be chosen from among a group of kings in his personal capacity, for instance by election or on the basis of genealogical superiority. Alternatively, the high kingship might be attached to the kingship of one of the constituent kingdoms, either permanently or when one kingdom is able to assert supremacy over the others. The high king's authority over other kings is usually limited, and in some high kingships his duties are largely ceremonial or restricted to occasions such as war that create a need for a unified command structure. Historical high kings Rulers who have been termed \\"high king\\" (by their contemporaries or by modern observers) include: *Various rulers of the ancient and early medieval kingdoms in Great Britain and Ireland have been called \\"High King\\"; **the High King of Ireland ('), like the legendary Brian Boru. **the High King of Scotland ('), especially the legendary Macbeth. **the King of the Britons, such as the legendary King Arthur, Uther Pendragon, and possibly Vortigern, have been termed \\"High King of Britain.\\" **the ruler of the Picts. **the \\"Bretwalda\\" was essentially the high king of the Anglo-Saxons, though the name is rarely translated as such. *some ancient Greek rulers, such as Agamemnon (see anax) *the most powerful king of the various Etruscan city-states *Mepe-Umaglesi (most high king) was a predicate of the Georgian Orthodox Mepe-Mepeta (king of kings) *in Lithuania, the title of Didysis Kunigaikštis is more accurately translated as \\"high king\\", although it is traditionally rendered as \\"grand duke\\" *in ancient Sumer, the rulers of all Sumer held the title of Nam-Lugal (high king).Dawson, Doyne. The First Armies. London: Cassell & Co. 2001, p. 80. In Imperial Germany, the German Emperor (Deutscher Kaiser), who was also the King of Prussia, could be considered a contemporary \\"high king\\", as he held seniority over the other monarchs of the empire (three kings, six grand dukes, five reigning dukes and seven reigning princes) as \\"president of the confederation\\". The Yang di-Pertuan Agong (literally \\"supreme lord\\") in Malaysia could probably be seen as a \\"high king\\", as he is elected from among nine Malay rulers of the states (seven sultans, a raja, and a Yang di-Pertuan Besar-literally \\"great lord\\") by the Conference of Rulers (through informal agreement, on a rotational basis). In practice, however, the term \\"high king\\" is rarely applied to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (king). Adhiraja or Adiraja is the comparable term of high king in India. The maharaja could possibly be rendered as \\"high king\\", although the literal meaning is closer to \\"emperor\\". Taewang, meaning \\"greatest of kings\\", was used by the later rulers of the Korean kingdom of Koguryo (and Silla, albeit to a rarer extent) to rank themselves as equals to the Chinese emperors or to express suzerainty over surrounding states, particularly during the Three Kingdoms Era. Daewang (great king) was used by rulers of other kingdoms and subsequent dynasties, including Baekje, whose king assumed the style of Daewang Pyeha (\\"his imperial majesty the great king\\") by the reign of King Mu (600-640 AD at the latest). However, after the Mongol Invasions of Korea, these rulers remained technically subordinate to the Mongol Empire and later China until King Gojong declared the Korean Empire in 1897 and assumed the title of Hwangje, or \\"emperor\\" (the Korean rendition of the Chinese \\"huang di\\"). Originally, the rulers of (), an ancient name of Japan, was known as the \\"Grand King of Yamato\\" (, ) or the \\"Kings of Wa\\" (, ) prior to the 7th century. It was later changed to become the Emperor of Japan (, ). The title \\"king of kings\\" also expresses much the same concept as \\"high king\\" - it was used at various times by the Emperor of Persia (') and the Emperor of Ethiopia. Similarly, the Imperial Mongolian title Khagan is sometimes translated as Khan of Khans.  In fiction  * is also the name of a J-pop group created in 2008 featuring Ai Takahashi, Reina Tanaka, Saki Shimizu, Maimi Yajima and Yuuka Maeda. * In C. S. Lewis's epic fantasy, The Chronicles of Narnia, Peter Pevensie was the High King of Narnia while his younger brother Edmund Pevensie was the King and his sisters Susan Pevensie and Lucy Pevensie were the Queens. He was also the high king over all kings of Narnia, from the first to the last. Aslan, the deity and the Great Lion of Narnia, is described as being \\"the High King above all High Kings\\", meaning he is the highest king over all rulers of Narnia. * In J. R. R. Tolkien's works, mainly The Silmarillion, there was a succession of high kings of the Noldor exiled in Middle-earth, beginning with Fëanor and culminating in Gil-galad's reign. Ingwë, leader of the Vanyar, is also referred as the High King of the Eldar, while Manwë is also sometimes titled High King of Arda. Thingol is acknowledged as high-king of Beleriand by Fingolfin. In the Third Age, the rulers of Arnor were known as \\"high kings\\", including Aragorn, as King Elessar, ruling the reunited kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor at the beginning of the Fourth Age. * In George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, the first human king ruling in Westeros was called the High King of the First Men. * In Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain, there is a line of High Kings of Prydain (a fictionalized version of Wales) who are descendants of a royal family who came from the Summer Country in order to oppose Arawn. The high king throughout the series is Gwydion's father Math, who is then succeeded by Gwydion and later Taran in the final novel of the series, The High King. * In Bethesda Softworks' The Elder Scrolls, the high king is the highest authority in the Province of Skyrim and theoretically the high king of Alinor is also the highest authority of the Summerset Isle (later renamed Alinor). * In Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft, the high king is the leader of the Alliance who has military control over the Alliance forces. *In Holly Black's The Folk of the Air series, there is a high king who rules over the land of faeries, Elfhame.

Early years Farah was born in Paterson, New Jersey, on July 6, 1954, to parents of Syrian and Lebanese ancestry. His father was a schoolteacher. He graduated from William Paterson University, in Wayne, New Jersey with a B.A. in Communications.  Career  Farah worked for six years as executive news editor at the Los Angeles Herald Examiner until the paper shuttered in 1989. On July 22, 1990, Farah became editor of The Sacramento Union. The paper had been losing up to $3 million annually, and in early 1990 it was purchased from Richard Mellon Scaife by Daniel Benvenuti Jr. and David Kassis. Farah and the paper's owners envisioned the paper as a conservative alternative to The Sacramento Bee. \\"We just thought the way to go was to be unabashedly conservative in our approach,\\" explained Farah to The Washington Post. Among other things, Farah convinced Rush Limbaugh to write a daily column, which ran on \\"Page 1.\\" Farah prohibited advertisement for films rated NC-17 in the newspaper. In 1991, Farah left the Union and co-founded the Western Journalism Center. He currently writes a weekly print column for The Jerusalem Post which is nationally syndicated through Creators Syndicate. He launched the online WorldNetDaily in 1997. The website has been categorized as far-right and is known for publishing unreliable or fringe material. In April 2019, WorldNetDaily announced that Farah had suffered a stroke and would withdraw from the website's day-to-day operations until he recovers.  Conspiracy theories  Farah gained prominence for promoting conspiracy theories surrounding the suicide of Vince Foster. Farah is a proponent of the conspiracy theory related to Barack Obama's status as a natural-born citizen of the United States and resultant eligibility to serve as U.S. president, stating, \\"It'll plague Obama throughout his presidency. It'll be a nagging issue and a sore on his administration, much like Monica Lewinsky was on Bill Clinton's presidency\\" and \\"It's not going to go away, and it will drive a wedge in an already divided public.\\" Despite the release of Obama's notarized birth certificate abstract, he continued to promoted birtherism.

The picture was directed by Raoul Walsh and features Teresa Wright, Robert Mitchum, Judith Anderson, Dean Jagger, Alan Hale Sr., and Harry Carey Jr.. The music is by Max Steiner and the cinematographer is James Wong Howe. Plot Set in New Mexico around the turn of the 20th century and told in flashback, the film tells the story of Jeb Rand (Mitchum), whose entire family was slaughtered when he was a child. In the aftermath of the massacre Jeb is found by Mrs Callum, a widow, who raises him in her family. Traumatized by the killings, Jeb does not recall anything of that night, except for vague images that he sees in a frequent nightmare. Mrs Callum raises him as her own son, together with her daughter Thor and her son Adam. Years later Jeb is shot at while riding a colt, but the shooter misses him; although Mrs Callum blames the incident on deer hunters she knows that it was an attempted murder by her brother-in-law Grant. She confronts Grant and it is revealed that there has been a long-standing feud between the Rands and the Callums. Jeb's father, with whom Mrs Callum was having an affair, took the life of her husband (Grant's brother) and, in an act of revenge, Grant killed Jeb's family. The night of the massacre, Grant's arm is so severely injured he eventually loses it. Mrs Callum pleads with her brother-in-law to leave Jeb alone, reasoning he is not a threat to anyone. Grant agrees to let Jeb live, at least until he grows up, in order to prove to Mrs Callum that one day Jeb will turn on her. Years later Jeb, Adam and Thor are adults and one day law officials arrive to recruit volunteers to join the US Army to fight the Spaniards. Jeb and Adam are told that one of them must join and, after agreeing on a coin toss, Jeb loses and signs up. He is injured in battle and, while recuperating in hospital, experiences again the flashbacks to the night of his family's murder. Due to his injuries he is honorably discharged from the army, sent home and awarded the Medal of Honor. It is apparent that adoptive brother and sister, Jeb and Thor have long been in love and, after his homecoming celebration, Jeb tries to convince Thor to run away with him and get married as soon as possible because he suspects that someone, or something, is following him. Thor refuses, saying that she wants to get married on her own terms and not out of fear. Jeb goes for a long horse ride in order to clear his head and stumbles upon an abandoned ranch which he suspects he has seen before. When he returns home, his mother confirms that the ranch he came across is indeed where he and his real parents lived when Jeb was a child and where the murders occurred. As Jeb prepares to leave to gamble at the casino in town, Adam shows him the money that had been set aside for him while he was in the army, and the profits he is entitled to according to their mother's wish that everything be split among the three. However, Adam calls Jeb's share the 'Rand share' and expresses resentment that there should be any money given to Jeb at all. The two agree that the ranch is not big enough for both of them and again agree to a coin toss to determine who will leave. Jeb loses; Adam relishes throwing him out and they end up in a fistfight. Jeb declares he will return the next day for Thor and promises that, if Adam tries to stop him, he will kill him. With only the coin with which to start betting Jeb has a big win at the casino and the owner, Jake Dingle, offers him a partnership. Meanwhile, having earlier researched Jeb's past and not wanting his sister to marry him, Adam ambushes Jeb on his way back from the casino, but is killed by Jeb, in self-defense. Jeb is acquitted of the murder in court but is shunned by Thor and Mrs Callum, who states that Jeb is dead to him. With no family, job or home of his own, Jeb accepts Jake Dingle's offer and becomes part-owner of the casino. Months later Jeb discovers that Thor is engaged to a man named Prentice and learns that Thor and Prentice will be attending a town dance. Jeb also attends the dance and forces Thor to dance with him. Grant Callum goads Prentice to defend Thor's honor and convinces him to make an attempt on Jeb's life. Jake Dingle warns Jeb that Prentice is coming for him. Jeb steps out the back door into the alley in an attempt to avoid the situation but Prentice is coming down the street. The two engage in a gun battle and Jeb is once again forced to kill in self-defense. Some time later Thor and Mrs Callum hatch a plan to gain revenge on Jeb for the pain he has caused them. Thor pretends to forgive Jeb and agrees to marry him, planning to murder him on their wedding night. When the moment arrives, Jeb reveals to her that he knows her plan; she cannot bring herself to carry out the murder and reconciles with him, somehow knowing in her heart that he is innocent and that he truly loves her. Tired of waiting, Grant Callum rounds up a gang of other Callums and they chase Jeb across the desert, intending to finish the job of killing all the Rands that Callum had begun all those years ago. Jeb finally recalls the night that his father and siblings were murdered, realizing that it was Grant who killed them and that Mrs Callum was there too. Thor finally learns that her mother had an affair with Jeb's father, and that when Mrs Callum's husband discovered it, he attempted to murder Rand, but was killed himself, resulting in Grant slaughtering Jeb's entire family to avenge his brother's death. On learning that Jeb survived the slaughter, Mrs Callum adopted him, out of guilt. Thor pleads with her mother not to allow Jeb to be hanged, stating there is still time to make up for her actions. As Grant is about to hang Jeb, Mrs Callum shoots him dead. She asks for and receives forgiveness from Jeb and Thor, and advises them to look to the future and enjoy their lives together.

Reception=Critical response Film critic Bosley Crowther wrote a mixed review, \\"... the strange and angry actions which occur through the tortuous wanderings of this drama seem decidedly bewildering and absurd. What's so significant about a fellow—even though he may be a foster- child—finding life slightly oppressive on a primitive New Mexican ranch? ... As we say, without the revelation which comes rather patly at the end, the urgency of these weighty questions is hard to grasp as the picture drones along. And it is likewise hard to work up any sympathy for the hero, who seems bored by all his woes. That may be because Robert Mitchum, who plays the latter, is a very rigid gent and gives off no more animation than a Frigidaire turned to 'Defrost.'\\" Variety magazine, on the other hand, praised the film. The Variety staff wrote, \\"Pursued is potent frontier days western film fare. Standout in picture is suspense generated by the original script and Raoul Walsh's direction. It builds the western gunman's death walk to high moments of thrill and action. Strong casting also is a decided factor in selling the action wares. Production makes use of natural outdoor backgrounds supplied by New Mexico scenery, lending air of authenticity that is fully captured by the camera.\\" Box office According to Warner Bros records the film earned $2,536,000 domestically and $1,175,000 foreign.

Clinker built (also known as lapstrake) is a method of boat building where the edges of hull planks overlap each other. Where necessary in larger craft, shorter planks can be joined end to end into a longer strake or hull plank. The technique developed in northern Europe and was successfully used by the Anglo-Saxons, Frisians, Scandinavians, and typical for the Hanseatic cog. A contrasting method, where plank edges are butted smoothly seam to seam, is known as carvel construction. Examples of clinker-built boats directly descended from those of the early medieval period are seen in the traditional round-bottomed Thames skiffs, and the larger (originally) cargo- carrying Norfolk wherries of England. Etymology From clinch, or clench, a common Germanic word, meaning “to fasten together”.  Origin  The technique of clinker developed in the Nordic shipbuilding tradition as distinct from the Mediterranean mortise and tenon planking technique which was introduced to the provinces of the north in the wake of Roman expansion. Overlapping seams already appear in the 4th century BC Hjortspring boat. The oldest evidence for a clinker-built vessel, dendrochronologically dated to 190 AD, are boat fragments which were found in recent excavations at the site of the famous Nydam Boat. The Nydam Boat itself, built ca. 320 AD, is the oldest preserved clinker-built boat.The Nydam Boats Clinker-built ships were a trademark of Nordic navigation throughout the Middle Ages, particularly of the longships of the Viking raiders and the trading cogs of the Hanseatic League. File:Nydamboat.2.jpgClinker hull of the Nydam Boat from Jutland File:Exhibition in Viking Ship Museum, Oslo 01.jpgClinkered prow of the Viking Oseberg ship File:Kogge stralsund.jpgClinker-built medieval cog from Stralsund Planking A comparison of clinker and carvel building styles. In building a simple pulling boat, the keel, hog, stem, apron, deadwoods, sternpost and perhaps transom are assembled and securely set up. In normal practice, this will be the same way up as they will be in use. From the hog, the garboard, bottom, bilge, topside and sheer strakes are planked up, held together along their ‘lands’ - the areas of overlap between neighbouring strakes - by copper rivets. At the stem and, in a double-ended boat, the sternpost, geralds are formed. That is, in each case, the land of the lower strake is tapered to a feather edge at the end of the strake where it meets the stem or stern-post. This allows the end of the strake to be screwed to the apron with the outside of the planking mutually flush at that point and flush with the stem. This means that the boat's passage through the water will not tend to lift the ends of the planking away from the stem. Before the next plank is laid up, the face of the land on the lower strake is bevelled to suit the angle at which the next strake will lie in relation with it. This varies all along the land. Gripes are used to hold the new strake in position on the preceding one before the fastening is done. Timbering or framing out Once the shell of planking is assembled, transverse battens of oak, ash or elm, called timbers are steam-bent to fit the internal, concave side. Elm species are not durable where the boat is used frequently in fresh water. As the timbers are bent in, they are copper riveted to the shell, through the lands of the planking. On many clinker built craft, e.g. in Scandinavia, in Thames skiffs, and larger working craft like the coble, sawn frames are used, assembled from floors and top timbers, joggled to fit the lands. Sometimes the timbers in larger craft were also joggled before being steamed in. With the timbers all fitted, longitudinal members are bent in. The thwart risings are fastened through the timbers with its upper edge on the level of the undersides of the thwarts. Bilge keels are added to the outside of the land on which the boat would lie on a hard surface to stiffen it and protect it from wear. A stringer is usually fitted round the inside of each bilge to strengthen it. In a small boat, this is usually arranged to serve also as a means of retaining the bottom boards. These are removable assemblies, shaped to lie over the bottom timbers and be walked upon. They spread the stresses from the crew's weight across the bottom structure. Longitudinals Inboard of the sheer strake the heavier gunwale is similarly bent in along the line of the sheer. This part of the work is finished by fitting the breast hook and quarter knees. Swivel or crutch chocks are fitted as appropriate to the gunwale, the thwarts fitted down onto the rising and held in position by knees up to the gunwale and perhaps down onto the stringer. The structure of gunwale, rising, thwart and thwart knees greatly stiffens and strengthens the shell and turns it into a boat. There are several ways of fixing the rubbing strake but in a clinker boat, it is applied to the outside of the sheer strake. Fittings Finally, the fittings such as swivels or crutch plate, painter ring, stretchers, keel and stem band are fitted and fixed with screws. In a sailing dinghy, there would be more fittings such as fairleads, horse, shroud plates, mast step, toe straps and so on. Finishing That more or less finishes the boatbuilder's work but the painter has yet to varnish or paint it. At stages along the way, he will have been called in to prime the timber, particularly immediately before the timbering is done. The boatbuilder will clean up the inside of the planking and the painter will prime it and probably more, partly because it is easier that way and partly so as to put some preservative on the planking behind the timbers. Similarly, it is best to have the varnishing done after the fittings are fitted but before they are shipped. Thus, the keel band will be shaped and drilled and the screw holes drilled in the wood of keel and stem then the band will be put aside while the varnishing is done. Fastenings The planks may be fastened together in several ways: * With copper or iron rivets consisting of a square nail and a dish shaped washer called a rove. The land is pierced, the nail knocked through from the outside, the rove punched on while the head is held up by a dolly (a small portable anvil, usually of cylindrical shape). The nail is cut off just proud of the rove and the cut end clenchedSome people would pronounce this word as \\"clinched\\" but there always was room for regional variation in boatbuilding words. over the rove while the dolly is used to hold the nail in place. In planking up clinker work, one man can hold both dolly and clenching hammer. Although this is common where sawn frames are to be used, boats intended for steamed timbers are usually nailed but not clenched until the timbering out is complete. As timbering is a two handed job it is more efficient to leave the clenching until help is at hand then the helper dollies up, whilst the builder sits inside the hull and clenches up. * With iron nails with the pointed nail ends protruding on the inside of the boat, bent over and back into the wood in the form of a hook. This is a cheap and cheerful technique maybe called clinching in some parts but usually, in England at least, \\"turnin'-em-over\\". It is the sort of thing which used to be found in Scandinavian-built boats but even with iron nails, on the lands, they were usually properly clenched over roves. Nails fastening timbers were sometimes turned over, particularly where removable bottom boards were to rest on the timbers. However, it was possible to tread the bottom boards onto the clenched nails and where marks were left, gouge out recesses to accommodate the clenched nails. * Screws were used for fixing the ends of the strakes to apron and transom and in later times, knees to gunwale and thwarts, but traditionally, this last would be done with a clench bolt or a large copper nail, clenched. * Adhesive, notably epoxy. Traditionally, lands were neither glued nor was anything used to bed them. The garboard was bedded onto the hog and keel, and the ends of the strakes onto the stem and apron using a mixture of white lead and grease. During the World Wars new techniques and materials were developed by the aircraft industry. By the mid-1950s, these were well infiltrated into the boatbuilding trade. New boats in classes of racing dinghy with clinker hulls were built as glued clinker boats. The basic construction was the same but ply planking was used and the lands were glued with no fastenings, except that the ends and garboards were still screwed to apron and hog. The need to prevent the splitting of the planks was removed by the use of ply so no timbers were used. Except for a light gunwale and wide rubbing strake, the longitudinals were omitted too. A short thwart rising and knees were glued to the planking. These boats were all decked and that is how adequate stiffness was achieved. So that the liquid glue could be laid onto the land before the next plank was assembled onto it, they were built upside down. Fastening the centre-line structure In the last few years of wooden boat construction, glue and screws took over, but until the 1950s, the keel, hog, stem, apron, deadwoods, sternpost, and perhaps transom would be fastened together by bolts set in white lead and grease. There are three kinds of bolt used, of which, nowadays, the screw bolt (i.e. threaded bolt), with its nut and washer, is by far the most common. The second type of bolt is the pin bolt or cotter bolt, which, instead of a thread, has a tapered hole forged through the end away from the head, into which a tapered pin or cotter is knocked. The taper is in effect a straight thread. In conjunction with a washer, this draws the bolt tight, as a nut does on a screw bolt. The third type of bolt is the clench bolt. It has some of the features of a rivet but was usually much longer than the normal rivet; in a wooden ship, perhaps a metre or more. For a shipwright's use, it is of copper. A head is formed by upsetting one end using a swage. It is then knocked through a hole bored through the work to be fastened, and through a washer. The head is held up with a dolly and the other end is upset over the washer in the same way as the head. Until well into the nineteenth century, this is what held the great ships of the world together, though some may have used iron. Until the late 1950s, the centre-line assembly of British Admiralty twenty-five foot motor cutters were fastened this way. Where suitable metal was not available, it was possible to use treenails (pronounced trennels). They were like clench bolts but made of wood, and instead of being clenched, they had a hardwood wedge knocked into each end to spread it. The surplus was then sawn off. Comparison between clinker and carvel The clinker form of construction is linked in people's minds with the Vikings who used this method to build their famous longships from riven timber (split wood) planks. Clinker is the most common English term for this construction in both British and American English, though in American English the method is sometimes also known as lapstrake; lapboard was used especially before the 20th century to side buildings, where the right angles of the structure lend themselves to quick assembly. The smoother surface of a carvel boat gives the impression at first sight that it is hydrodynamically more efficient. The lands of the planking are not there to disturb the stream line. This distribution of relative efficiency between the two forms of construction is an illusion because for given hull strength, the clinker boat is lighter. Additionally, the clinker built method as used by the Vikings created a vessel which could twist and flex relative to the line extending length of the vessel, bow to stern. This gave it an advantage in North Atlantic rollers so long as the vessel was small in overall displacement. Increasing the beam, due to the light nature of the method, did not commensurately increase the vessel's survivability under the torsional forces of rolling waves, and greater beam widths may have made the resultant vessels more vulnerable. There is an upper limit to the size of clinker built vessels, which could be and was exceeded by several orders of magnitude in later large sailing vessels incorporating carvel-built construction. Clinker requires relatively wide planking stock compared to carvel, as carvel can employ stealers to reduce plank widths amidships where the girth is greatest. The need for sufficient lap to accept the clench fastenings drives towards wider planks in proportion to thickness than can be employed in carvel. In all other areas of construction, including framing, deck, etc., clinker is as capable as carvel. Clinker construction remains to this day a valuable method of construction for small wooden vessels.

Features The engineers who designed the Fairchild F8 Microcomputer did so mindful of a set of goals. The computer needed to be electrically frugal. It needed characteristics that permitted easy interface to standard SSI and MSI components. It needed a moderate instruction set. It needed to be easy to incorporate into a design. The design needed to put the maximum number of computer components and circuits into the LSI components to minimize the package count. This approach reduced the time spent on designing support logic circuits. These goals resulted in a microcomputer with a multiplexed bus architecture, with just two buses for all functions: the time-multiplexed data bus and a 7-bit control bus for synchronizing the system's components relative to the data bus. The functions of the F8 were distributed among several devices resulting in system simplification. In the F8 the control bus regulates the use of the data bus through the use of timing signals and state controls. The phi clock divides the machine cycle into discrete phases depending on the instruction being executed. The five state control lines are a function of the instruction being executed. The control bus states regulate the control of information in the computer. The F3851 is the program storage unit containing 1K ROM. It is programmed in manufacturing using a mask that could be specified by the customer of Fairchild. The F3851A PSU, in the F8 Evaluation Kit 1, was filled with the Fairbug program that allowed inspection and modification of memory, jumping to routines, viewing registers, punching paper tape, and interacting with a teletype user. All 64K of memory could be addressed, and any section could be RAM or ROM. The Fairbug PSU was a demonstration of packing many routines into a 1K ROM. Other memory interfaces include the F3852 Dynamic Memory Interface and F3853 Static Memory Interface. The program counter (PC) is maintained in the respective support chips: The PSU, DMI and the SMI. There is one program counter for each support chip in the system, which all stores the same count. The individual support-chip will use its internal program counter when the next instruction is from its own address space, otherwise it will just maintain it and keep it up to date without fetching instructions. The memory support chips also contain a pair of data counters each, where only one of them is in use at any time. There are no restrictions in the F8 for how memory addresses are used, as the F8 implements a von Neumann architecture. Memory can be used to store both data and code, and the CPU makes no distinction in how the memory is treated in both cases. The F8 has two bidirectional 8-bit ports built into every PSU, but not the DMI and SMI. An interrupt in the F3850 is similar to a subroutine call. A power-on detection organizes the computer circuitry. The machine instructions can be grouped into six categories: accumulator instructions, branch instructions, memory reference instructions, address register instructions, scratchpad register instruction, miscellaneous instructions (interrupt, input, output, indirect scratchpad register, load, and store).Preliminary F8 Microprocessor Data Book, Introduction, Fairchild Semiconductor, June 27, 1975, Revision A The Fairchild F8 microcomputer was made available in late 1975 to electronic design engineers. The board has three large scale integration devices packaged in 40-pin ICs: CPU, PSU, and SMI. This circuit board performed as a 64K 8-bit personal computer which interfaced to a Teletype. The design permitted additional interfaces to floppy disk and other devices. A program called Fairbug, which resided in a 1K PSU, allowed users to view and change memory and registers, and test programs written in the machine code. This device appeared at the beginning of the transition from time shared computers to personal computers. FAIR-BUG Fairchild provided development and evaluation kits for the F8, these kits included a 3851A PSU (Program Storage Unit) which contained a monitor in mask ROM, vectored to start at address 0x8080. At power-on, the ROM was entered. The ROM monitor was referred to in Fairchild literature as FAIR-BUG. The FAIR-BUG monitor is a constellation of routines for assisting product development engineers who interacted with FAIR-BUG from a Teletype. Fairchild extended FAIR-BUG as KD-BUG, for use with a keyboard and display. FAIR-BUG main commands are single ASCII characters drawn from the set {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I, L, M, N, P, R, S, W}. Register and memory locations were keyed in as parameters immediately after the command identifier. For example, the command M02F0-02FF results in the content of 16 bytes of memory being typed out by the Teletype. FAIR-BUG commands address all memory locations and all registers. These locations can be examined or modified by the programmer. FAIR-BUG contains five subroutines which are used in processing commands: Input 2 ASCII Bytes; Output 1 ASCII byte; Output the string CR, LF, Null; Output 1 ASCII byte; Input 1 ASCII Byte from a Parallel Input Device. FAIR-BUG is essentially a random access management routine for all memory, both RAM and ROM, and all registers including program counter, data counter, and scratchpad. The programmer is given the ability to plant any of the 70+ machine code instructions or operands into memory locations. The programmer can then use the G command to load a specific address into the program counter and execute the routine at that address. The objective in providing the FAIR-BUG routines in 1975 was to assist engineers in speeding up the creation of applications for the F8 ICs. Design The processor itself had no address bus -- memory addresses were kept in each co-processor's own address counter and were manipulated through five control signals, reducing the number of pins and the associated cost. It also featured 64 bytes of scratchpad memory, accessed by the ISAR register in cells (register windows) of eight, which meant external RAM was not always needed for small applications. In addition, the 2-chip processor did not need support chips, unlike others which needed seven or more. The use of the ISAR register allowed a subroutine to be entered without saving registers, the ISAR would just be changed, speeding execution. Special purpose registers were usually stored in the second cell (regs 8-15), and only the first sixteen registers could be accessed directly. The windowing concept was useful, but only the register pointed to by the ISAR could be accessed -- to access other registers, the ISAR was incremented or decremented through the window. The F8 ran at 1–2 MHz, yielding a 0.5 μs cycle time. History The Fairchild F8 microcomputer evolved during 1974 and 1975.Patent: US3984813. Filing date: Oct. 7, 1974. Original Assignee: Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation. The first set of integrated circuits were available to engineers in 1975. These 40-pin integrated circuits required documentation for putting the F8 microcomputer to work. The Preliminary F8 Microcomputer Data Book from Fairchild Semiconductor carries the date June 27, 1975. A Guide to Programming the Fairchild F8 Microcomputer also carries the date June 27, 1975. Another document titled A Timeshare Users Guide for the Fairchild F8 Microcomputer was published August 7, 1975 as Revision A. In September 1975 Fairchild published User's Manual F8 Design Evaluation Kit Number 1. These documents were meant to accompany the Fairchild F8 Design Evaluation Kit 1 which was being sold to engineers. Kit 1 was an 8-bit microprocessor on a single circuit board. The board had three 40-pin ICs: F3850, F3851, F3853. The F3850 held the Central Processing Unit. The F3851 held a Read-Only Memory that contained a program called Fairbug. The F3853 contained circuitry to interface to static random access memory of 64K bytes. The circuit board allowed a simple interface to a Teletype for interacting with the Fairbug program.The One-Card F8 Microprocessor Evaluation System Instruction Sheet, Fairchild Microsystems, February 13, 1976.F8 Microprocessor, Fairchild Semiconductor, 1975F8 Fairbug User's Guide, Fairchild Micro Systems, September 15, 1976User's Manual F8 Design Evaluation Kit Number One, Fairchild Semiconductor, September 1975, Revision BSchematic Drawing, F8 Microprocessor Design Evaluation Kit, Revision B, August 21, 1975Preliminary F8 Microprocessor Data Book, Fairchild Semiconductor, June 27, 1975, Revision AA Guild to Programming the Fairchild F-8 Microcomputer, Fairchild Semiconductor, June 27, 1975, Revision AA Timeshare Users Guide for the Fairchild F8 Microprocessor, Fairchild Semiconductor, August 7, 1975, Revision A The F8 was released in a single-chip implementation (the Mostek 3870) in 1977.

The full titulature of Darius was Great King, King of Kings, King in Fārs, King of the Countries, Hystaspes’ son, Arsames’ grandson, an Achaemenid. King of Kings (Akkadian: šar šarrāni;' Old Persian: Xšâyathiya Xšâyathiyânâm;''''' Middle Persian: šāhān šāh;''''' Modern Persian: شاهنشاه, Šâhanšâh; Greek: Βασιλεὺς Βασιλέων, Basileùs Basiléōn;''''' Armenian: արքայից արքա, ark'ayits ark'a; Georgian: მეფეთ მეფე, Mepet mepe; Ge'ez: ንጉሠ ነገሥት, Nəgusä Nägäst) was a ruling title employed primarily by monarchs based in the Middle East. Though most commonly associated with Iran (historically known as Persia in the WestYarshater, Ehsan Persia or Iran, Persian or Farsi , Iranian Studies, vol. XXII no. 1 (1989)), especially the Achaemenid and Sasanian Empires, the title was originally introduced during the Middle Assyrian Empire by king Tukulti- Ninurta I (reigned 1233–1197 BC) and was subsequently used in a number of different kingdoms and empires, including the aforementioned Persia, various Hellenic kingdoms, Armenia, Georgia and Ethiopia. The title is commonly seen as equivalent to that of Emperor, both titles outranking that of king in prestige, stemming from the medieval Byzantine emperors who saw the Shahanshahs of the Sasanian Empire as their equals. The last reigning monarchs to use the title of Shahanshah, those of the Pahlavi dynasty in Iran (1925–1979), also equated the title with \\"Emperor\\". The rulers of the Ethiopian Empire used the title of Nəgusä Nägäst (literally \\"King of Kings\\"), which was officially translated into \\"Emperor\\". The female variant of the title, as used by the Ethiopian Zewditu, was Queen of Kings (Ge'ez: Nəgəstä Nägäst). In the Sasanian Empire, the female variant used was Queen of Queens (Middle Persian: bānbishnān bānbishn).  Historical usage = Ancient India  In Ancient India, Sanskrit language words such as Chakravarti, Rajadhiraja are among the words that were used for employing the title of the King of Kings. These words also occur in Aitareya Aranyaka and other parts of Rigveda (1700 BCE - 1100 BCE).  Ancient Mesopotamia  Assyria and Babylon = King of Kings was among the many titles used by King Ashurbanipal of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (depicted strangling and stabbing a lion). The title King of Kings was first introduced by the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I (who reigned between 1233 and 1197 BC) as šar šarrāni. The title carried a literal meaning in that a šar was traditionally simply the ruler of a city- state. With the formation of the Middle Assyrian Empire, the Assyrian rulers installed themselves as kings over an already present system of kingship in these city-states, becoming literal \\"kings of kings\\". Following Tukulti- Ninurta's reign, the title was occasionally used by monarchs of Assyria and Babylon.''''' Later Assyrian rulers to use šar šarrāni include Esarhaddon (r. 681–669 BC) and Ashurbanipal (r. 669–627 BC). \\"King of Kings\\", as šar šarrāni, was among the many titles of the last Neo-Babylonian king, Nabonidus (r. 556–539 BC). Boastful titles claiming ownership of various things were common throughout ancient Mesopotamian history. For instance, Ashurbanipal's great- grandfather Sargon II used the full titulature of Great King, Mighty King, King of the Universe, King of Assyria, King of Babylon, King of Sumer and Akkad.'''''''''' = Urartu and Media = The title of King of Kings occasionally appears in inscriptions of kings of Urartu.''''' Although no evidence exists, it is possible that the title was also used by the rulers of the Median Empire, since its rulers borrowed much of their royal symbolism and protocol from Urartu and elsewhere in Mesopotamia. The Achaemenid Persian variant of the title, Xšâyathiya Xšâyathiyânâm, is Median in form which suggests that the Achaemenids may have taken it from the Medes rather than from the Mesopotamians.''''' An Assyrian-language inscription on a fortification near the fortress of Tušpa mentions King Sarduri I of Urartu as a builder of a wall and a holder of the title King of Kings;''''''''''  Iran  Achaemenid usage = Xerxes the Great of the Achaemenid Empire referred to himself as the great king, the king of kings, the king of the provinces with many tongues, the king of this great earth far and near, son of king Darius the Achaemenian. The Achaemenid Empire, established in 550 BC after the fall of the Median Empire, rapidly expanded over the course of the sixth century BC. Asia Minor and the Lydian kingdom was conquered in 546 BC, the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BC, Egypt in 525 BC and the Indus region in 513 BC. The Achaemenids employed satrapal administration, which became a guarantee of success due to its flexibility and the tolerance of the Achaemenid kings for the more-or-less autonomous vassals. The system also had its problems; though some regions became nearly completely autonomous without any fighting (such as Lycia and Cilicia), other regions saw repeated attempts at rebellion and secession.''''' Egypt was a particularly prominent example, frequently rebelling against Achaemenid authority and attempting to crown their own Pharaohs. Though it was eventually defeated, the Great Satraps' Revolt of 366–360 BC showed the growing structural problems within the Empire.''''' The Achaemenid Kings used a variety of different titles, prominently Great King and King of Countries, but perhaps the most prominent title was that of King of Kings (rendered Xšâyathiya Xšâyathiyânâm in Old Persian)''''', recorded for every Achaemenid king. The full titulature of the king Darius I was \\"great king, king of kings, king in Fārs, king of the countries, Hystaspes’ son, Arsames’ grandson, an Achaemenid\\".''''' An inscription in the Armenian city of Van by Xerxes I reads;'''''''''' = Parthian and Sasanian usage = Mithridates I of Parthia (r. 171–132 BC) was the first post-Achaemenid Iranian king to use the title of King of Kings. Beginning with the reign of his nephew Mithridates II (r. 124–88 BC), the title remained in consistent usage until the fall of the Sasanian Empire in 651 AD. The standard royal title of the Arsacid (Parthian) kings while in Babylon was Aršaka šarru (\\"Arsacid king\\"), King of Kings (recorded as šar šarrāni by contemporary Babylonians)''''' was adopted first by Mithridates I (r. 171–132 BC), though he used it infrequently. The title first began being consistently used by Mithridates I's nephew, Mithridates II, who after adopting it in 111 BC used it extensively, even including it in his coinage (as the Greek BAΣIΛEΥΣ BAΣIΛEΩN)''''' until 91 BC.''''' It is possible that Mithridates II's, and his successors', use of the title was not a revival of the old Achaemenid imperial title (since it was not used until almost a decade after Mithridates II's own conquest of Mesopotamia) but actually stemmed from Babylonian scribes who accorded the imperial title of their own ancestors onto the Parthian kings.''''' Regardless of how he came to acquire the title, Mithridates II did undertake conscious steps to be seen as an heir to and restorer of Achaemenid traditions, introducing a crown as the customary headgear on Parthian coins and undertaking several campaigns westwards into former Achaemenid lands.'''''''''' The title was rendered as šāhān šāh in Middle Persian and Parthian and remained in consistent use until the ruling Arsacids were supplanted by the Sasanian dynasty of Ardashir I, creating the Sasanian Empire. Ardashir himself used a new variant of the title, introducing \\"Shahanshah of the Iranians\\" (Middle Persian: šāhān šāh ī ērān). Ardashir's successor Shapur I introduced another variant; \\"Shahanshah of the Iranians and non-Iranians\\" (Middle Persian: šāhān šāh ī ērān ud anērān), possibly only assumed after Shapur's victories against the Roman Empire (which resulted in the incorporation of new non-Iranian lands into the empire). This variant, Shahanshah of Iranians and non-Iranians, appear on the coinage of all later Sasanian kings.''''' The final Shahanshah of the Sasanian Empire was Yazdegerd III (r. 632–651 AD). His reign ended with the defeat and conquest of Persia by the Rashidun Caliphate, ending the last pre-Islamic Iranian Empire. The defeat of Yazdegerd and the fall of the Sasanian Empire was a blow to the national sentiment of the Iranians, which was slow to recover. Although attempts were made at restoring the Sasanian Empire, even with Chinese help, these attempts failed and the descendants of Yazdegerd faded into obscurity.''''' The title Shahanshah was criticized by later Muslims, associating it with the Zoroastrian faith and referring to it as \\"impious\\".'''''''''' The female variant of the title in the Sasanian Empire, as attested for Shapur I's (r. 240–270 AD) daughter Adur-Anahid, was the matching bānbishnān bānbishn (\\"Queen of Queens\\"). The similar title shahr banbishn (\\"Queen of the empire\\") is attested for Shapur I's wife Khwarranzem. = Buyid revival = Panāh Khusraw, better known by his laqab 'Adud al-Dawla, revived the title of Shahanshah in Iran in the year 978 AD, more than three centuries after the fall of the Sasanian Empire.Following the fall of the Sasanian Empire, Iran was ruled by a series of relatively short-lived Muslim Iranian dynasties; including the Samanids and Saffarids. Although Iranian resentment against the Abbasid Caliphs was common, the resentment materialized as religious and political movements combining old Iranian traditions with new Arabic ones rather than as full-scale revolts. The new dynasties do not appear to have had any interest in re-establishing the empire of the old Shahanshahs, they at no point seriously questioned the suzerainty of the Caliphs and actively promoted Arabic culture. Though the Samanids and the Saffarids also actively promoted the revival of the Persian language, the Samanids remained loyal supporters of the Abbasids and the Saffarids, despite at times being in open rebellion, did not revive any of the old Iranian political structures.'''''''''' The shiite Buyid dynasty, of Iranian Daylamite origin, came to power in 934 AD through most of the old Iranian heartland. In contrast to earlier dynasties, ruled by Emirs and wanting to appease the powerful ruling Caliphs, the Buyids consciously revived old symbols and practices of the Sasanian Empire.''''' The region of Daylam had resisted the Caliphate since the fall of the Sasanian Empire, attempts at restoring a native Iranian rule built on Iranian traditions had been many, though unsuccessful. Asfar ibn Shiruya, a Zoroastrian and Iranian nationalist, rebelled against the Samanids in 928 AD, intending to put a crown on himself, set up a throne of gold and make war on the Caliph. More prominently, Mardavij, who founded the Ziyarid Dynasty, was also Zoroastrian and actively aspired to restore the old empire. He was quoted as promising to destroy the empire of the Arabs and restore the Iranian empire and had a crown identical to the one worn by the Sasanian Khosrow I made for himself.''''' At the time he was murdered by his own Turkic troops, Mardavij was planning a campaign towards Baghdad, the Abbasid capital. Subsequent Ziyarid rulers were Muslim and made no similar attempts.'''''''''' After the death of Mardavij, many of his troops entered into the service of the founder of the Buyid dynasty, Imad al-Dawla.''''' Finally, the Buyid Emir Panāh Khusraw, better known by his laqab (honorific name) of 'Adud al-Dawla proclaimed himself Shahanshah after defeating rebellious relatives and becoming the sole ruler of the Buyid dynasty in 978 AD.' Those of his successors that likewise exercised full control over all the Buyid emirates would also style themselves as Shahanshah.'''''''' ' During times of Buyid infighting, the title became a matter of importance. When a significant portion of Firuz Khusrau's (laqab Jalal al-Dawla) army rebelled in the 1040s and wished to enthrone the other Buyid Emir Abu Kalijar as ruler over the lands of the entire dynasty, they minted coins in his name with one side bearing the name of the ruling Caliph (Al-Qa'im) and the other side bearing the inscription \\"al-Malik al-Adil Shahanshah\\".''''' When discussing peace terms, Abu Kalijar in turn addressed Jalal in a letter with the title Shahanshah.''''' When the struggle between Abu Kalijar and Jalal al-Dawla resumed, Jalal, wanting to assert his superiority over Kalijar, made a formal application to Caliph Al-Qa'im for the usage of the title Shahanshah, the first Buyid ruler to do so. It can be assumed that the Caliph agreed (since the title was later used), but its usage by Jalal in a mosque caused outcry at its impious character.''''' Following this, the matter was raised to a body of jurists assembled by the Caliph. Though some dissented, the body as a whole ruled that the usage of al-Malik al-Adil Shahanshah was lawful.'''''  Hellenic usage  Seleucid rulers frequently assumed old Persian titles and honors, the usurper Timarchus is one of few concrete examples of a Seleucid ruler using the title \\"King of Kings\\". Alexander the Great's conquests ended the Achaemenid Empire and the subsequent division of Alexander's own empire resulted in the Seleucid dynasty inherting the lands formerly associated with the Achaemenid dynasty. Although Alexander himself did not employ any of the old Persian royal titles, instead using his own new title \\"King of Asia\\" (βασιλεὺς τῆς Ἀσίας)''''', the monarchs of the Seleucid Empire more and more aligned themselves to the Persian political system. The official title of most of the Seleucid kings was \\"Great King\\", which like \\"King of Kings\\", a title of Assyrian origin, was frequently used by the Achaemenid rulers and was intended to demonstrate the supremacy of its holder over other rulers. \\"Great King\\" is prominently attested for both Antiochus I (r. 281–261 BC) in the Borsippa Cylinder and for Antiochus III the Great (r. 222–187 BC) throughout his rule.''''' In the late Seleucid Empire, \\"King of Kings\\" even saw a revival, despite the fact that the territory controlled by the Empire was significantly smaller than it had been during the reigns of the early Seleucid kings. The title was evidently quite well known to be associated with the Seleucid king, the usurper Timarchus (active 163–160 BC) called himself \\"King of Kings\\" and the title was discussed in sources from outside the empire as well.''''' Some non-Seleucid rulers even assumed the title for themselves, notably in Pontus (especially prominently used under Mithridates VI Eupator).''''' It is possible that the Seleucid usage indicates that the title no longer implied complete vassalization of other kings but instead a recognition of suzerainty (since the Seleucids were rapidly losing the loyalty of their vassals at the time).''''''''''  Armenia and Georgia  The King of Kings Tigranes the Great of Armenia with four vassal Kings surrounding him After the Parthian Empire under Mithridates II defeated Armenia in 105 BC, the heir to the Armenian throne, Tigranes, was taken hostage and kept at the Parthian court until he bought his freedom in 95 BC (by handing over \\"seventy valleys\\" in Atropatene) and assumed the Armenian throne.''''' Tigranes ruled, for a short time in the first century BC, the strongest empire in the Middle East which he had built himself. After conquering Syria in 83 BC, Tigranes assumed the title King of Kings.''''' The Armenian kings of the Bagratuni dynasty from the reign of Ashot III 953–977 AD to the dynasty's end in 1064 AD revived the title, rendering it as the Persian Shahanshah.'''''''''' King of Kings was revived in the Kingdom of Georgia by King David IV (r. 1089–1125 AD), rendered as mepet mepe in Georgian. All subsequent Georgian monarchs, such as Tamar the Great, used the title to describe their rule over all Georgian principalities, vassals and tributaries. Their use of the title probably derived from the ancient Persian title.''''''''''  Palmyra  After a successful campaign against the Sasanian Empire in 262 AD, which restored Roman control to territories that had been lost to the Shahanshah Shapur I, the ruler of the city of Palmyra, Odaenathus, founded the Palmyrene kingdom. Though a Roman vassal, Odaenathus assumed the title Mlk Mlk dy Mdnh (King of Kings and Corrector of the East). Odaenathus son, Herodianus (Hairan I) was acclaimed as his co-monarch, also given the title King of Kings. Usage of the title was probably justified through proclaiming the Palmyrene kingdom as the legitimate successor state of the Hellenic Seleucid empire, which had controlled roughly the same territories near its end. Herodianus was crowned at Antioch, which had been the final Seleucid capital. Though the same title was used by Odaenathus second son and successor following the deaths of both Odaenathus and Herodianus, Vaballathus and his mother Zenobia soon relinquished it, instead opting for the Roman Augustus (\\"Emperor\\") and Augusta (\\"Empress\\") respectively.  Ethiopia  The title King of Kings was used by the rulers of the Aksumite Kingdom since the reign Sembrouthes c. 250 AD. The rulers of the Ethiopian Empire, which existed from 1270 to 1974 AD, also used the title of Nəgusä Nägäst, sometimes translated to \\"King of the Kingdom\\", but most often equated to \\"King of Kings\\" and officially translated to Emperor. Though the Ethiopian Emperors had been literal \\"Kings of Kings\\" for the duration of the Empire's history, with regional lords using the title of Nəgus (\\"king\\"), this practice was ended by Haile Selassie (r. 1930–1974 AD), who somewhat paradoxically still retained the use of Nəgusä Nägäst. Empress Zewditu (r. 1916–1930 AD), the only female monarch of the Ethiopian Empire, assumed the variant \\"Queen of Kings\\" (Nəgəstä Nägäst).  In religion = Judaism and Christianity  \\"Christ as King of Kings\\". A Russian icon from Murom (1690). In Judaism, Melech Malchei HaMelachim (\\"the King of Kings of Kings\\") came to be used as a name of God, using the double superlative to put the title one step above the royal title of the Babylonian and Persian kings referred to in the Bible.'''''''''' \\"King of Kings\\" (βασιλεὺς τῶν βασιλευόντων) is used in reference to Jesus Christ several times in the Bible, notably once in the First Epistle to Timothy (6:15) and twice in the Book of Revelation (17:14, 19:11–16);'''''Some Christian realms (Georgia, Armenia and Ethiopia) employed the title and it was part of the motto of the Byzantine Emperors of the Palaiologan period, Βασιλεὺς Βασιλέων Βασιλεύων Βασιλευόντων (Basileus Basileōn, Basileuōn Basileuontōn, literally \\"King of Kings, ruling over those who rule\\"). In the Byzantine Empire the word Βασιλεὺς (Basileus), which had meant \\"king\\" in ancient times had taken up the meaning of \\"emperor\\" instead. Byzantine rulers translated \\"Basileus\\" into \\"Imperator\\" when using Latin and called other kings rēx or rēgas, hellenized forms of the Latin title rex.''''' As such, Βασιλεὺς Βασιλέων in the Byzantine Empire would have meant \\"Emperor of Emperors\\". The Byzantine rulers only accorded the title of Basileus onto two foreign rulers they considered to be their equals, the Kings of Axum and the Shahanshahs of the Sasanian Empire, leading to \\"King of Kings\\" being equated to the rank of \\"Emperor\\" in the view of the West.''''''''''  Islam  Following the fall of the Sasanian Empire in 651 AD, the title of Shahanshah was sternly criticized in the Muslim world. It was problematic enough that the adoption of Shahanshah by the Muslim Buyid dynasty in Persia required a body of jurists to agree on its lawfulness''''' and the title itself (both as \\"king of kings\\" and as the Persian variant Shahanshah) is condemned in Sunni hadith, a prominent example being Sahih al-Bukhari Book 73 Hadiths 224 and 225;''''' The condemnation of the title within the Islamic world may stem from that the concept of God alone being king had been prominent in early Islam. Opposing worldly kingship, the use of \\"King of Kings\\" was obnoxious and blasphemous.''''''''''  Modern usage =Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (r. 1941–1979) was the last monarch of Iran and the last Iranian ruler to take the title Shahanshah. After the end of the Buyid dynasty in 1062 AD, the title of Shahanshah wouldn't be adopted by another Iranian ruler until Ismail I, the founder of the Safavid dynasty. Upon his capture of Tabriz in 1501 AD, more than four hundred years after the end of the Buyid dynasty, Ismail proclaimed himself the Shāh of Azerbaijan and the Shahanshah of Iran.''''' The term šāhanšāh-e Irān, King of Kings of Iran, is richly attested for the Safavid period and for the preceding Timurid period (when it was not in use).''''' Nader Shah, founder of the later Afsharid Dynasty, assumed the title šāhanšāh in 1739 to emphasize his superiority over Muhammad Shah of the Mughal Empire in India.'''''''''' The title Shahanshah is also attested for Fath-Ali Shah Qajar of the Qajar dynasty (r. 1797–1834). Fath- Ali's reign was noted for its pomp and elaborate court protocol.''''' An 1813/1814 portrait of Fath-Ali contains a poem with the title; \\"Is this a portrait of a shahanshah, inhabitant of the skies / Or is it the rising of the sun and the image of the moon?\\".''''' The Qajar dynasty was overthrown in 1925, replaced by the Pahlavi dynasty. Both reigning members of this dynasty, Reza Shah Pahlavi (r. 1925–1941) and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (r. 1941–1979), before they too were overthrown as part of the Iranian revolution in 1979, used the title of Shahanshah.''''' Although Mohammad Reza Pahlavi had reigned as Shah for twenty-six years by then, he only took the title of Shahanshah on 26 October 1967 in a lavish coronation ceremony held in Tehran. He said that he chose to wait until this moment to assume the title because in his own opinion he \\"did not deserve it\\" up until then; he is also recorded as saying that there was \\"no honour in being Emperor of a poor country\\" (which he viewed Iran as being until that time).''''' The current head of the exiled house of Pahlavi, Reza Pahlavi II, symbolically declared himself Shahanshah at the age of 21 after the death of his father in 1980.'''''''''' Muammar Gaddafi In 2008, the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi claimed to be a \\"King of Kings\\". A gathering of more than 200 African tribal kings and chiefs endorsed his use of the title on 28 August that year, stating that \\"We have decided to recognise our brotherly leader as the 'king of kings, sultans, princes, sheikhs and mayors of Africa\\". At the meeting, held in the city of Benghazi, Gaddafi was given gifts including a throne, an 18th-century Qur'an, traditional outfits and ostrich eggs. At the same meeting, Gaddafi urged his guests to put pressure on their own governments and speed the process of moving towards a unified African continent. Gaddafi told those that attended the meeting that \\"We want an African military to defend Africa, we want a single African currency, we want one African passport to travel within Africa\\".''''' The meeting was later referred to as a \\"bizarre ceremony\\" in international media.'''''

Its defining characteristics include: more diverse and user-determined gaming hardware and software; and generally greater capacity in input, processing, video and audio output. The uncoordinated nature of the PC game market, and now its lack of physical media, make precisely assessing its size difficult. In 2018, the global PC games market was valued at about $27.7 billion.https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191107005499/en/Global- PC-Games-Market-Analysis-2015-2019-Forecasting Home computer games became popular following the video game crash of 1983, leading to the era of the \\"bedroom coder\\". In the 1990s, PC games lost mass-market traction to console games, before enjoying a resurgence in the mid-2000s through digital distribution. Newzoo reports that the PC gaming sector is the third-largest category (and estimated in decline) across all platforms , with the console sector second-largest, and mobile / smartphone gaming sector biggest. 2.2 billion video gamers generate US$101.1 billion in revenue, excluding hardware costs. \\"Digital game revenues will account for $94.4 billion or 87% of the global market. Mobile is the most lucrative segment, with smartphone and tablet gaming growing 19% year on year to $46.1 billion, claiming 42% of the market. In 2020, mobile gaming will represent just more than half of the total games market. [...] China expected to generate $27.5 billion, or one-quarter of all revenues in 2017.\\" PC gaming is considered synonymous (by Newzoo and others) with IBM Personal Computer compatible systems; while mobile computers – smartphones and tablets, such as those running Android or iOS – are also personal computers in the general sense. The APAC region was estimated to generate $46.6 billion in 2016, or 47% of total global video game revenues (note, not only \\"PC\\" games). China alone accounts for half of APAC's revenues (at $24.4 billion), cementing its place as the largest video game market in the world, ahead of the US's anticipated market size of $23.5 billion. China is expected to have 53% of its video game revenues come from mobile gaming in 2017 (46% in 2016).  History = Early growth  Spacewar!, developed for the PDP-1 in 1961, is often credited as being the second ever computer game. The game consisted of two player-controlled spaceships maneuvering around a central star, each attempting to destroy the other. Bertie the Brain was one of the first game playing machines developed. It was built in 1950 by Josef Kates. It measured more than four meters tall, and was displayed at the Canadian National Exhibition that year. Although personal computers only became popular with the development of the microprocessor and microcomputer, computer gaming on mainframes and minicomputers had previously already existed. OXO, an adaptation of tic-tac-toe for the EDSAC, debuted in 1952. Another pioneer computer game was developed in 1961, when MIT students Martin Graetz and Alan Kotok, with MIT student Steve Russell, developed Spacewar! on a PDP-1 mainframe computer used for statistical calculations. The first generation of computer games were often text-based adventures or interactive fiction, in which the player communicated with the computer by entering commands through a keyboard. An early text-adventure, Adventure, was developed for the PDP-11 minicomputer by Will Crowther in 1976, and expanded by Don Woods in 1977. By the 1980s, personal computers had become powerful enough to run games like Adventure, but by this time, graphics were beginning to become an important factor in games. Later games combined textual commands with basic graphics, as seen in the SSI Gold Box games such as Pool of Radiance, or The Bard's Tale, for example. By the late 1970s to early 1980s, games were developed and distributed through hobbyist groups and gaming magazines, such as Creative Computing and later Computer Gaming World. These publications provided game code that could be typed into a computer and played, encouraging readers to submit their own software to competitions. Players could modify the BASIC source code of even commercial games. Microchess was one of the first games for microcomputers which was sold to the public. First sold in 1977, Microchess eventually sold over 50,000 copies on cassette tape. As with second-generation video game consoles at the time, early home computer game companies capitalized on successful arcade games at the time with ports or clones of popular arcade games. By 1982, the top-selling games for the Atari 400 were ports of Frogger and Centipede, while the top-selling game for the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A was the Space Invaders clone TI Invaders. That same year, Pac-Man was ported to the Atari 800, while Donkey Kong was licensed for the Coleco Adam. In late 1981, Atari attempted to take legal action against unauthorized clones, particularly Pac-Man clones, despite some of these predating Atari's exclusive rights to the home versions of Namco's game.  Industry crash and aftermath  As the video game market became flooded with poor-quality cartridge games created by numerous companies attempting to enter the market, and overproduction of high-profile releases such as the Atari 2600 adaptations of Pac-Man and E.T. grossly underperformed, the popularity of personal computers for education rose dramatically. In 1983, consumer interest in console video games dwindled to historical lows, as interest in games on personal computers rose. The effects of the crash were largely limited to the console market, as established companies such as Atari posted record losses over subsequent years. Conversely, the home computer market boomed, as sales of low-cost color computers such as the Commodore 64 rose to record highs and developers such as Electronic Arts benefited from increasing interest in the platform. To enhance the immersive experience with their unrealistic graphics and electronic sound, early PC games included extras such as the peril- sensitive sunglasses that shipped with The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or the science fiction novella included with Elite. These extras gradually became less common, but many games were still sold in the traditional oversized boxes that used to hold the extra \\"feelies\\". Today, such extras are usually found only in Special Edition versions of games, such as Battlechests from Blizzard. The North American console market experienced a resurgence in the United States with the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). In Europe, computer gaming continued to boom for many years after. Computers such as the ZX Spectrum and BBC Micro were successful in the European market, where the NES was not as successful despite its monopoly in Japan and North America. The only 8-bit console to have any success in Europe would be the Sega Master System. Meanwhile, in Japan, both consoles and computers became major industries, with the console market dominated by Nintendo and the computer market dominated by NEC's PC-88 (1981) and PC-98 (1982). A key difference between Western and Japanese computers at the time was the display resolution, with Japanese systems using a higher resolution of 640x400 to accommodate Japanese text which in turn affected video game design and allowed more detailed graphics. Japanese computers were also using Yamaha's FM synth sound boards from the early 1980s. Reprinted from During the 16-bit era, the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST became popular in Europe, while the PC-98, Sharp X68000 and FM Towns became popular in Japan. The Amiga, X68000 and FM Towns were capable of producing near arcade-quality hardware sprite graphics and sound quality when they first released in the mid-to-late 1980s.  Growth of IBM PC gaming  Among launch titles for the IBM Personal Computer (PC) in 1981 was Microsoft Adventure, which IBM described as bringing \\"players into a fantasy world of caves and treasures\\". BYTE that year stated that the computer's speed and sophistication made it \\"an excellent gaming device\\", and IBM and others sold games like Microsoft Flight Simulator. The PC's CGA graphics and speaker sound were poor, however, and most customers bought the powerful but expensive computer for business. One ComputerLand owner estimated in 1983 that a quarter of corporate executives with computers \\"have a game hidden somewhere in their drawers\\", and InfoWorld in 1984 reported that \\"in offices all over America (more than anyone realizes) executives and managers are playing games on their computers\\", but software companies found selling games for the PC difficult; an observer said that year that Flight Simulator had sold hundreds of thousands of copies because customers with corporate PCs could claim that it was a \\"simulation\\". From mid-1985, however, what Compute! described as a \\"wave\\" of inexpensive IBM PC clones from American and Asian companies, such as the Tandy 1000, caused prices to decline; by the end of 1986, the equivalent to a $1600 real IBM PC with 256K RAM and two disk drives cost as little as $600, lower than the price of the Apple IIc. Consumers began purchasing DOS computers for the home in large numbers. While often purchased to do work on evenings and weekends, clones' popularity caused consumer- software companies to increase the number of IBM-compatible products, including those developed specifically for the PC as opposed to porting from other computers. Bing Gordon of Electronic Arts reported that customers used computers for games more than one fifth of the time whether purchased for work or a hobby, with many who purchased computers for other reasons finding PC games \\"a pretty satisfying experience\\". By 1987, the PC market was growing so quickly that the formerly business-only computer had become the largest and fastest-growing, and most important platform for computer game companies. DOS computers dominated the home, supplanting Commodore and Apple. More than a third of games sold in North America were for the PC, twice as many as those for the Apple II and even outselling those for the Commodore 64. With the EGA video card, an inexpensive clone had better graphics and more memory for games than the Commodore or Apple, and the Tandy 1000's enhanced graphics, sound, and built-in joystick ports made it the best platform for IBM PC-compatible games before the VGA era. By 1988, the enormous popularity of the Nintendo Entertainment System had greatly affected the computer-game industry. A Koei executive claimed that \\"Nintendo's success has destroyed the [computer] software entertainment market\\". A Mindscape executive agreed, saying that \\"Unfortunately, its effect has been extremely negative. Without question, Nintendo's success has eroded software sales. There's been a much greater falling off of disk sales than anyone anticipated.\\" A third attributed the end of growth in sales of the Commodore 64 to the console, and Trip Hawkins called Nintendo \\"the last hurrah of the 8-bit world\\". Experts were unsure whether it affected 16-bit computer games, but Hawkins in 1990 nonetheless had to deny rumors that Electronic Arts would withdraw from computers and only produce console games. By 1993 ASCII Entertainment reported at a Software Publishers Association conference that the market for console games ($5.9 billion in revenue) was 12 times that of the computer-game market ($430 million). However, computer games did not disappear. By 1989 Computer Gaming World reported that \\"the industry is moving toward heavy use of VGA graphics\\". While some games were advertised with VGA support at the start of the year, they usually supported EGA graphics through VGA cards. By the end of 1989, however, most publishers moved to at supporting at least 320x200 MCGA, a subset of VGA. VGA gave the PC graphics that outmatched the Amiga. Increasing adoption of the computer mouse, driven partially by the success of adventure games such as the highly successful King's Quest series, and high resolution bitmap displays allowed the industry to include increasingly high-quality graphical interfaces in new releases. Further improvements to game artwork and audio were made possible with the introduction of FM synthesis sound. Yamaha began manufacturing FM synth boards for computers in the early-mid-1980s, and by 1985, the NEC and FM-7 computers had built-in FM sound. The first PC sound cards, such as AdLib's Music Synthesizer Card, soon appeared in 1987. These cards allowed IBM PC compatible computers to produce complex sounds using FM synthesis, where they had previously been limited to simple tones and beeps. However, the rise of the Creative Labs Sound Blaster card, released in 1989, which featured much higher sound quality due to the inclusion of a PCM channel and digital signal processor, led AdLib to file for bankruptcy by 1992. Also in 1989, the FM Towns computer included built-in PCM sound, in addition to a CD-ROM drive and 24-bit color graphics. By 1990, DOS was 65% of the computer- game market, with the Amiga at 10%; all other computers, including the Apple Macintosh, were below 10% and declining. Although both Apple and IBM tried to avoid customers associating their products with \\"game machines\\", the latter acknowledged that VGA, audio, and joystick options for its PS/1 computer were popular. In 1991, id Software produced an early first-person shooter, Hovertank 3D, which was the company's first in their line of highly influential games in the genre. There were also several other companies that produced early first-person shooters, such as Arsys Software's Star Cruiser, which featured fully 3D polygonal graphics in 1988,スタークルーザー (translation), 4Gamer.net and Accolade's Day of the Viper in 1989. Id Software went on to develop Wolfenstein 3D in 1992, which helped to popularize the genre, kick- starting a genre that would become one of the highest-selling in modern times. The game was originally distributed through the shareware distribution model, allowing players to try a limited part of the game for free but requiring payment to play the rest, and represented one of the first uses of texture mapping graphics in a popular game, along with Ultima Underworld. In December 1992, Computer Gaming World reported that DOS accounted for 82% of computer- game sales in 1991, compared to Macintosh's 8% and Amiga's 5%. In response to a reader's challenge to find a DOS game that played better than the Amiga version the magazine cited Wing Commander and Civilization, and added that \\"The heavy MS-DOS emphasis in CGW merely reflects the realities of the market\\". A self-reported Computer Gaming World survey in April 1993 similarly found that 91% of readers primarily used IBM PCs and compatibles for gaming, compared to 6% for Amiga, 3% for Macintosh, and 1% for Atari ST, while a Software Publishers Association study found that 74% of personal computers were IBMs or compatible, 10% Macintosh, 7% Apple II, and 8% other. 51% of IBM or compatible had 386 or faster CPUs. By 1992 DOS games such as Links 386 Pro supported Super VGA graphics. While leading Sega and Nintendo console systems kept their CPU speed at 3–7 MHz, the 486 PC processor ran much faster, allowing it to perform many more calculations per second. The 1993 release of Doom on the PC was a breakthrough in 3D graphics, and was soon ported to various game consoles in a general shift toward greater realism. Computer Gaming World reiterated in 1994, \\"we have to advise readers who want a machine that will play most of the games to purchase high-end MS-DOS machines\\". By spring 1994 an estimated 24 million US homes (27% of households) had a personal computer. 48% played games on their computer; 40% had the 486 CPU or higher; 35% had CD-ROM drives; and 20% had a sound card. Another survey found that an estimated 2.46 million multimedia computers had internal CD-ROM drives by the end of 1993, an increase of almost 2,000%. Computer Gaming World reported in April 1994 that some software publishers planned to only distribute on CD as of 1995. CD-ROM had much larger storage capacity than floppies, helped reduce software piracy, and was less expensive to produce. Chris Crawford warned that it was \\"a data-intensive technology, not a process- intensive one\\", tempting developers to emphasize the quantity of digital assets like art and music over the quality of gameplay; Computer Gaming World wrote in 1993 that \\"publishers may be losing their focus\\". While many companies used the additional storage to release poor-quality shovelware collections of older software, or \\"enhanced\\" versions of existing ones—often with what the magazine mocked as \\"amateur acting\\" in the added audio and video—new games such as Myst included many more assets for a richer game experience. Many companies sold \\"multimedia upgrade kits\\" that bundled CD drives, sound cards, and software during the mid-1990s, but device drivers for the new peripherals further depleted scarce RAM. By 1993, PC games required much more memory than other software, often consuming all of conventional memory, while device drivers could go into upper memory with DOS memory managers. Players found modifying \`CONFIG.SYS\` and \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` files for memory management cumbersome and confusing, and each game needed a different configuration. (The game Les Manley in: Lost in L.A. satirizes this by depicting two beautiful women exhaust the hero in bed, by requesting that he again explain the difference between extended and expanded memory.) Computer Gaming World provided technical assistance to its writers to help install games for review, and published sample configuration files. The magazine advised non-technical gamers to purchase commercial memory managers like QEMM and 386MAX and criticized nonstandard software like Origin Systems's \\"infamous late and unlamented Voodoo Memory Manager\\", which used unreal mode.  Contemporary gaming  By 1996, the growing popularity of Microsoft Windows simplified device driver and memory management. The success of 3D console titles such as Super Mario 64 and Tomb Raider increased interest in hardware accelerated 3D graphics on PCs, and soon resulted in attempts to produce affordable solutions with the ATI Rage, Matrox Mystique, S3 ViRGE, and Rendition Vérité. As 3D graphics libraries such as DirectX and OpenGL matured and knocked proprietary interfaces out of the market, these platforms gained greater acceptance in the market, particularly with their demonstrated benefits in games such as Unreal.Shamma, Tahsin. Review of Unreal, Gamespot.com, June 10, 1998. However, major changes to the Microsoft Windows operating system, by then the market leader, made many older DOS-based games unplayable on Windows NT, and later, Windows XP (without using an emulator, such as DOSbox). The faster graphics accelerators and improving CPU technology resulted in increasing levels of realism in computer games. During this time, the improvements introduced with products such as ATI's Radeon R300 and NVidia's GeForce 6 Series have allowed developers to increase the complexity of modern game engines. PC gaming currently tends strongly toward improvements in 3D graphics. Unlike the generally accepted push for improved graphical performance, the use of physics engines in computer games has become a matter of debate since announcement and 2005 release of the nVidia PhysX PPU, ostensibly competing with middleware such as the Havok physics engine. Issues such as difficulty in ensuring consistent experiences for all players, and the uncertain benefit of first generation PhysX cards in games such as Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter and City of Villains, prompted arguments over the value of such technology. Similarly, many game publishers began to experiment with new forms of marketing. Chief among these alternative strategies is episodic gaming, an adaptation of the older concept of expansion packs, in which game content is provided in smaller quantities but for a proportionally lower price. Titles such as Half-Life 2: Episode One took advantage of the idea, with mixed results rising from concerns for the amount of content provided for the price.  Foreign PC gaming = Polish  During the 1980s, the cheap and talented workforce of the Polish People's Republic began producing video games with Warsaw company Karen, founded by enterprising emigrant Lucjan Wencel, developing many hits that were released in the United States. The 1991 strategy game \\"Solidarność\\" by Przemysław Rokita, where players led a trade union to political victory, was the symbolic beginning of a new trend where interactive works applied video game conventions to local Polish culture and history, and through a distorting mirror portrayed the Eastern Bloc, local villages, and the mentality of citizens. Developers in this age struggled with minimal profits, working after hours, harsh working conditions, older computers, and an ignorance of foreign languages and sentiments. The country saw its own text based games – e.g. Mózgprocesor (1989), arcade games – e.g. Robbo (1989), football manager – Polish League (1995), Doom-clone – Cytadela (1995), and The Settlers-clone – Polanie (1995), however the adventure game genre was the \\"most significant species in the 90s\\", a genre which was finally cracked with Tajemnica Statuetki. Tajemnica Statuetki was the first commercially released Polish adventure game, one of the first Polish and Polish-language video games ever, and Chmielarz's first game that he had developed from start to finish – the first officially sold program that he wrote. It is sometimes erroneously considered the first Polish computer game, a distinction held by Witold Podgórski's 1961 mainframe game Marienbad, inspired by a Chinese puzzle called \\"Nim\\", and released on the Odra 1003. (Meanwhile, Polygamia writes that 1986's text-based Puszka Pandory is the first game written by a Pole, sold in Poland, and reviewed in Polish press). Despite this, Onet wrote in 2013 about a common misconception that the game marks the point where the history of digital entertainment in Poland begins.  Platform characteristics = Fidelity  In high-end PC gaming, a PC will generally have far more processing resources at its disposal than other gaming systems. Game developers can use this to improve the visual fidelity of their game relative to other platforms, but even if they do not, games running on PC are likely to benefit from higher screen resolution, higher framerate, and anti-aliasing. Increased draw distance is also common in open world games. Better hardware also increases the potential fidelity of a PC game's rules and simulation. PC games often support more players or NPCs than equivalents on other platforms and game designs which depend on the simulation of large numbers of tokens (e.g. Guild Wars 2, World of Warcraft) are rarely seen anywhere else. The PC also supports greater input fidelity thanks to its compatibility with a wide array of peripherals. The most common forms of input are the mouse/keyboard combination and gamepads, though touchscreens and motion controllers are also available. The mouse in particular lends players of first-person shooter and real-time strategy games on PC great speed and accuracy.  Openness  The defining characteristic of the PC platform is the absence of centralized control; all other gaming platforms (except Android devices, to an extent) are owned and administered by a single group. The advantages of openness include: ; Reduced software cost : Prices are kept down by competition and the absence of platform-holder fees. Games and services are cheaper at every level, and many are free. ; Increased flexibility : PC games decades old can be played on modern systems, through emulation software if need be. Conversely, newer games can often be run on older systems by reducing the games' fidelity and/or scale. ; Increased innovation : One does not need to ask for permission to release or update a PC game or to modify an existing one, and the platform's hardware and software are constantly evolving. These factors make PC the centre of both hardware and software innovation. By comparison, closed platforms tend to remain much the same throughout their lifespan. There are also disadvantages, including: ; Increased complexity : A PC is a general- purpose tool. Its inner workings are exposed to the owner, and misconfiguration can create enormous problems. Hardware compatibility issues are also possible. Game development is complicated by the wide variety of hardware configurations; developers may be forced to limit their design to run with sub-optimum PC hardware in order to reach a larger PC market, or add a range graphical and other settings to adjust for playability on individual machines, requiring increased development, test, and customer support resources. ; Increased hardware cost : PC components are generally sold individually for profit (even if one buys a pre-built machine), whereas the hardware of closed platforms is mass-produced as a single unit and often sold at a smaller profit, or even a loss (with the intention of making profit instead in online service fees and developer kit profits). ; Reduced security : It is difficult, and in most situations ultimately impossible, to control the way in which PC hardware and software is used. This leads to far more software piracy and cheating than closed platforms suffer from. = Modifications = The openness of the PC platform allows players to edit or modify their games and distribute the results over the Internet as \\"mods\\". A healthy mod community greatly increases a game's longevity and the most popular mods have driven purchases of their parent game to record heights. It is common for professional developers to release the tools they use to create their games (and sometimes even source code) in order to encourage modding, but if a game is popular enough mods generally arise even without official support. Mods can compete with official downloadable content however, or even outright redistribute it, and their ability to extend the lifespan of a game can work against its developers' plans for regular sequels. As game technology has become more complex, it has also become harder to distribute development tools to the public. Modding has a different connotation on consoles which are typically restricted much more heavily. As publicly released development tools are rare, console mods usually refer to hardware alterations designed to remove restrictions.  Dominant software  Although the PC platform is almost completely decentralized at a hardware level, there are two dominant software forces: the Microsoft Windows operating system and the Steam distribution service. Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20, 1985 as an add-on to DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world's personal computer market with over 90% market share, overtaking Mac OS, which had been introduced in 1984. Valve does not release any sales figures on its Steam service, instead it only provides the data to companies with games on Steam, which they cannot release without permission due to signing a non-disclosure agreement with Valve. However, Stardock, the previous owner of competing platform Impulse, estimated that, as of 2009, Steam had a 70% share of the digital distribution market for video games. In early 2011, Forbes reported that Steam sales constituted 50–70% of the $4 billion market for downloaded PC games and that Steam offered game producers gross margins of 70% of purchase price, compared with 30% at retail. In 2011, Steam served over 780 petabytes of information, double what it had delivered in 2010. = Digital distribution services = PC games are sold predominantly through the Internet, with buyers downloading their new purchase directly to their computer. This approach allows smaller independent developers to compete with large publisher-backed games and avoids the speed and capacity limits of the optical discs which most other gaming platforms rely on. Valve released the Steam platform for Windows computers in 2003 as a means to distribute Valve-developed video games such as Half-Life 2. It would later see release on the Mac OS X operating system in 2010 and was released on Linux in 2012 as well. By 2011, it controlled 70% of the market for downloadable PC games, with a userbase of about 40 million accounts. Origin, a new version of the Electronic Arts online store, was released in 2011 in order to compete with Steam and other digital distribution platforms on the PC. The period between 2004 and now saw the rise of many digital distribution services on PC, such as Amazon Digital Services, GameStop, GFWL, EA Store, Direct2Drive, GOG.com, and GamersGate. Digital distribution also slashes the cost of circulation, eliminates stock shortages, allows games to be released worldwide at no additional cost, and allows niche audiences to be reached with ease. However, most digital distribution systems create ownership and customer rights issues by storing access rights on distributor-owned computers. Games confer with these computers over the Internet before launching. This raises the prospect of purchases being lost if the distributor goes out of business or chooses to lock the buyer's account, and prevents resale (the ethics of which are a matter of debate).  PC gaming technology  thumbright250pxAn exploded view of a modern personal computer:  Hardware  Modern computer games place great demand on the computer's hardware, often requiring a fast central processing unit (CPU) to function properly. CPU manufacturers historically relied mainly on increasing clock rates to improve the performance of their processors, but had begun to move steadily towards multi- core CPUs by 2005. These processors allow the computer to simultaneously process multiple tasks, called threads, allowing the use of more complex graphics, artificial intelligence and in-game physics. Similarly, 3D games often rely on a powerful graphics processing unit (GPU), which accelerates the process of drawing complex scenes in realtime. GPUs may be an integrated part of the computer's motherboard, the most common solution in laptops, or come packaged with a discrete graphics card with a supply of dedicated Video RAM, connected to the motherboard through either an AGP or PCI-Express port. It is also possible to use multiple GPUs in a single computer, using technologies such as NVidia's Scalable Link Interface and ATI's CrossFire. Sound cards are also available to provide improved audio in computer games. These cards provide improved 3D audio and provide audio enhancement that is generally not available with integrated alternatives, at the cost of marginally lower overall performance. The Creative Labs SoundBlaster line was for many years the de facto standard for sound cards, although its popularity dwindled as PC audio became a commodity on modern motherboards. Physics processing units (PPUs), such as the Nvidia PhysX (formerly AGEIA PhysX) card, are also available to accelerate physics simulations in modern computer games. PPUs allow the computer to process more complex interactions among objects than is achievable using only the CPU, potentially allowing players a much greater degree of control over the world in games designed to use the card. Virtually all personal computers use a keyboard and mouse for user input, but there are exceptions. During the 1990s, before the keyboard and mouse combination had become the method of choice for PC gaming input peripherals, there were other types of peripherals such as the Mad Catz Panther XL, the First-Person Gaming Assassin 3D, and the Mad Catz Panther, which combined a trackball for looking / aiming, and a joystick for movement. Other common gaming peripherals are a headset for faster communication in online games, joysticks for flight simulators, steering wheels for driving games and gamepads for console-style games.  Software  Computer games also rely on third-party software such as an operating system (OS), device drivers, libraries and more to run. Today, the vast majority of computer games are designed to run on the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems. Whereas earlier games written for DOS would include code to communicate directly with hardware, today application programming interfaces (APIs) provide an interface between the game and the OS, simplifying game design. Microsoft's DirectX is an API that is widely used by today's computer games to communicate with sound and graphics hardware. OpenGL is a cross-platform API for graphics rendering that is also used. The version of the graphics card's driver installed can often affect game performance and gameplay. In late 2013, AMD announced Mantle, a low-level API for certain models of AMD graphics cards, allowing for greater performance compared to software-level APIs such as DirectX, as well as simplifying porting to and from the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles, which are both built upon AMD hardware. It is not unusual for a game company to use a third- party game engine, or third-party libraries for a game's AI or physics.  Multiplayer  Local area network gaming = Multiplayer gaming was largely limited to local area networks (LANs) before cost-effective broadband Internet access became available, due to their typically higher bandwidth and lower latency than the dial-up services of the time. These advantages allowed more players to join any given computer game, but have persisted today because of the higher latency of most Internet connections and the costs associated with broadband Internet. LAN gaming typically requires two or more personal computers, a router and sufficient networking cables to connect every computer on the network. Additionally, each computer must have its own copy (or spawn copy) of the game in order to play. Optionally, any LAN may include an external connection to the Internet. = Online games = Online multiplayer games have achieved popularity largely as a result of increasing broadband adoption among consumers. Affordable high-bandwidth Internet connections allow large numbers of players to play together, and thus have found particular use in massively multiplayer online role-playing games, Tanarus and persistent online games such as World War II Online. Although it is possible to participate in online computer games using dial-up modems, broadband Internet connections are generally considered necessary in order to reduce the latency or \\"lag\\" between players. Such connections require a broadband-compatible modem connected to the personal computer through a network interface card (generally integrated onto the computer's motherboard), optionally separated by a router. Online games require a virtual environment, generally called a \\"game server\\". These virtual servers inter-connect gamers, allowing real time, and often fast-paced action. To meet this subsequent need, Game Server Providers (GSP) have become increasingly more popular over the last half decade. While not required for all gamers, these servers provide a unique \\"home\\", fully customizable, such as additional modifications, settings, etc., giving the end gamers the experience they desire. Today there are over 510,000 game servers hosted in North America alone.  Emulation  Emulation software, used to run software without the original hardware, are popular for their ability to play legacy video games without the platform for which they were designed. The operating system emulators include DOSBox, a DOS emulator which allows playing games developed originally for this operating system and thus not compatible with a modern-day OS. Console emulators such as Nestopia and MAME are relatively commonplace, although the complexity of modern consoles such as the Xbox or PlayStation makes them far more difficult to emulate, even for the original manufacturers. The most technically advanced consoles that can currently be successfully emulated for commercial games on PC are the PlayStation 2 using PCSX2, and the Nintendo Wii U using the Cemu emulator. A PlayStation 3 emulator named RPCS3 is in development, although it can currently only run small Homebrew games and certain old arcade titles that were originally ported to the PS3 from older platforms. Most emulation software mimics a particular hardware architecture, often to an extremely high degree of accuracy. This is particularly the case with classic home computers such as the Commodore 64, whose software often depends on highly sophisticated low-level programming tricks invented by game programmers and the demoscene.  Controversy  PC games have long been a source of controversy, largely due to the depictions of violence that has become commonly associated with video games in general. The debate surrounds the influence of objectionable content on the social development of minors, with organizations such as the American Psychological Association concluding that video game violence increases children's aggression, a concern that prompted a further investigation by the Centers for Disease Control in September 2006. Industry groups have responded by noting the responsibility of parents in governing their children's activities, while attempts in the United States to control the sale of objectionable games have generally been found unconstitutional. Video game addiction is another cultural aspect of gaming to draw criticism as it can have a negative influence on health and on social relations. The problem of addiction and its health risks seems to have grown with the rise of massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs). Alongside the social and health problems associated with computer game addiction have grown similar worries about the effect of computer games on education.  Computer games museums  There are several computer games museums around the world. In 2011 one opened in Berlin, a computer game museum that documents computer games from the 1970s until today. The Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment, in Oakland, California also exhibits PC games in its general collection. The Video Game Museum in Rome is dedicated to the preservation of videogames, and includes Pss games in its collection. The Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California holds a collection of PC games, and allows visitors to play Spacewar!, the first computer game, on a restored original DEC PDP-1.

The majority of cases are caused by malignant tumors within the mediastinum, most commonly lung cancer and non- Hodgkin's lymphoma, directly compressing or invading the SVC wall. Non- malignant causes are increasing in prevalence due to expanding use of intravascular devices (such as permanent central venous catheters and leads for pacemakers and defibrillators), which can result in thrombosis. Other non- malignant causes include benign mediastinal tumors, aortic aneurysm, infections, and fibrosing mediastinitis. Characteristic features are edema (swelling due to excess fluid) of the face and arms and development of swollen collateral veins on the front of the chest wall. Shortness of breath and coughing are quite common symptoms; difficulty swallowing is reported in 11% of cases, headache in 6% and stridor (a high-pitched wheeze) in 4%. The symptoms are rarely life-threatening, though edema of the epiglottis can make breathing difficult, edema of the brain can cause reduced alertness, and in less than 5% of cases of SVCO, severe neurological symptoms or airway compromise are reported. Resolution of superior vena cava syndrome is directly related to the treatment of the underlying compression. Signs and symptoms Shortness of breath is the most common symptom, followed by face or arm swelling.emedicine > Superior Vena Cava Syndrome.

Retrieved Mars 2011 *Pemberton's sign Superior vena cava syndrome usually presents more gradually with an increase in symptoms over time as malignancies increase in size or invasiveness. Cause Thrombosis of the superior vena cava caused by an indwelling central venous catheter which caused superior vena cava syndrome Over 80% of cases are caused by malignant tumors compressing the superior vena cava. Lung cancer, usually small cell carcinoma, comprises 75-80% of these cases and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, comprises 10-15%. Rare malignant causes include Hodgkin's lymphoma, metastatic cancers, leukemia, leiomyosarcoma of the mediastinal vessels, and plasmocytoma. Syphilis and tuberculosis have also been known to cause superior vena cava syndrome. SVCS can be caused by invasion or compression by a pathological process or by thrombosis in the vein itself, although this latter is less common (approximately 35% due to the use of intravascular devices). Diagnosis A CXR of a person with lung cancer which was causing superior vena cava syndrome. A CT image showing compression of the right hilar structures by cancer. The main techniques of diagnosing SVCS are with chest X-rays (CXR), CT scans, transbronchial needle aspiration at bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy. CXRs often provide the ability to show mediastinal widening and may show the presenting primary cause of SVCS. However, 16% of people with SVC syndrome have a normal chest X-ray. CT scans should be contrast enhanced and be taken on the neck, chest, lower abdomen, and pelvis. They may also show the underlying cause and the extent to which the disease has progressed. Treatment Several methods of treatment are available, mainly consisting of careful drug therapy and surgery. Glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or methylprednisolone) decrease the inflammatory response to tumor invasion and edema surrounding the tumor. Glucocorticoids are most helpful if the tumor is steroid-responsive, such as lymphomas. In addition, diuretics (such as furosemide) are used to reduce venous return to the heart which relieves the increased pressure. In an acute setting, endovascular stenting by an interventional radiologist may provide relief of symptoms in as little as 12–24 hours with minimal risks. Should a patient require assistance with respiration whether it be by bag/valve/mask, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or mechanical ventilation, extreme care should be taken. Increased airway pressure will tend to further compress an already compromised SVC and reduce venous return and in turn cardiac output and cerebral and coronary blood flow. Spontaneous respiration should be allowed during endotracheal intubation until sedation allows placement of an ET tube and reduced airway pressures should be employed when possible. Prognosis Symptoms are usually relieved with radiation therapy within one month of treatment. However, even with treatment, 99% of patients die within two and a half years. This relates to the cancerous causes of SVC found in 90% of cases. The average age of disease onset is 54 years.

Mostek was an integrated circuit manufacturer, founded in 1969 by L. J. Sevin, Louay E. Sharif, Richard L. Petritz and other ex-employees of Texas Instruments. Initially their products were manufactured in Worcester, Massachusetts, however by 1974 most of its manufacturing was done in the Carrollton, Texas facility on Crosby Road. At its peak in the late 1970s, Mostek held an 85% market share of the dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) memory chip market worldwide, until being eclipsed by Japanese DRAM manufacturers who offered equivalent chips at lower prices by dumping memory on the market. In 1979, soon after its market peak, Mostek was purchased by United Technologies Corporation for $345M. In 1985, after several years of red ink and declining market share, UTC sold Mostek for $71M to the French electronics firm Thomson SA, later part of STMicroelectronics. Mostek's intellectual property portfolio, which included rights to the Intel x86 microprocessor family as well as many foundational patents in DRAM technology, provided a large windfall of royalty payments for STMicroelectronics in the 1990s. Early calculator business Early Mostek calculator on a chip Mostek's first contract was from Burroughs, a $400 contract for circuit design. The first design to be produced in their newly set-up MOS fab in Worcester, was the MK1001, a simple shifter chip. This was followed by a 1K PMOS aluminum-gate DRAM, the MK4006 that was manufactured in their Carrollton facility. Mostek had been working with Sprague Electric to develop the ion implantation process which provided a tremendous gain in the control of doping profiles. Using ion implantation, Mostek became an early leader in MOS manufacturing technology, while their competition was still mostly using the older bipolar technology. The resulting increased speed and lower cost of the MK4006 memory chip made it the runaway favorite to IBM and other mainframe and minicomputer manufacturers (cf. BUNCH, Digital Equipment Corporation). In 1970 Busicom, a Japanese adding machine manufacturer, approached Intel and Mostek with a proposal to introduce a new electronic calculator line. Intel responded first, providing them with the Intel 4004, which they used in a line of desktop calculators. Mostek's device took longer to develop but was a single chip calculator solution, the MK6010. Busicom used the Mostek design in a new handheld line, the Busicom LE-120A, which went on the market in 1971 and was the smallest calculator available for some time. Hewlett-Packard also contracted with Mostek for mask development and production of chips for their HP-35 and HP-45 lines. World leader in DRAM Mostek co-founder Robert Proebsting invented DRAM address multiplexing with the MK4096 4096 X 1 bit DRAM introduced in 1973. Address multiplexing was a revolutionary approach which reduced cost and board space by fitting a 4K DRAM into a 16 pin package, while competitors took the evolutionary approach which led to a bulky and relatively expensive 22 pin package. Competitors derided the Mostek approach as unnecessarily complex, but Proebsting understood the future roadmap for DRAM memories would benefit greatly if only one new pin were needed for every 4X increase in memory size, instead of the two pins per 4X for the evolutionary approach. Computer manufacturers found address multiplexing to be a compelling feature as they saw a future 64K DRAM chip would save 8 pins if implemented with address multiplexing and subsequent generations even more. Per pin costs are a major cost driver in integrated circuits, plus the multiplexed approach used less silicon area, which further reduces chip cost. The MK4096 was produced using an NMOS aluminum-gate process with an added interconnect layer of polysilicon (dubbed the SPIN process) The fear, uncertainty and doubt put up by the competition regarding address multiplexing was dispelled by the actual performance of the MK4096 which proved solid and robust in all types of computer memory designs. In 1976 Mostek introduced the silicon-gate MK4027 (an improved version of the metal-gated MK4096), and the new MK4116 16K double-poly silicon-gate DRAM. They were designed by Paul Schroeder, who later left Mostek to co-found Inmos. From this point until the late 1970s Mostek was a continual leader in the DRAM field, holding as much as 85% of the world market for DRAM. The MK4027 and MK4116 were reverse- engineered by Mosaid and successfully cloned by many companies. The 64K generation of DRAMs required a transition from 12 volt (and + and − 5 volt) to 5 volt-only operation, in order to free the +12 and −5 volt pins for use as addresses (the +5 volts and ground pins were assigned to pins 8 and 16, respectively, rather than the 16-pin TTL DIP standard of pin 8 for ground and pin 16 for +5 volts). While most competitors took a conservative approach by scaling the basic MK4116 design and process, Mostek undertook a major redesign which incorporated forward-looking features (such as controlled precharge current) that were not necessary at the 64K level and delayed their entry into the market. Mostek's 256K DRAM was further delayed by a then-ambitious two layer metallization design. When the price for 64K DRAMs collapsed in 1985, Mostek's 256K device was not ready for volume production, and the company suffered heavy losses. Mostek's DRAM legacy is exemplified in the MK4116, MK4164 and MK41256, each of which were successfully cloned by competitors, both USA-based and overseas-based. \\"By four\\" DRAM was a simple adaptation of the MK4116/MK4164/MK41256 technology, utilizing a larger package to accommodate the additional data bits and multiplexing the data in/out pins as well; the basic *RAS, *CAS, *WRITE and multiplexed address bus concept was retained intact. World leader in telecommunications products Mostek enjoyed many years of mastery of the international market for telecommunications products. Their product line included telephone tone and pulse dialers, touchtone decoders, counters, top-octave generators (used by Hammond, Baldwin, and others), CODECs, watch circuits, and a host of custom products for a variety of customers. The custom products used the simple PMOS process and helped maintain Mostek's cash flow through a smoky fire in the fab that closed it for six months, intense DRAM competition, and other semiconductor market pressures. During the fab shutdown production of the PMOS products was shifted to several external fabs. Several employees played a key role in the Telecommunications and Industrial Products Department. Robert Paluck headed the department, assisted by Michael Callahan, Charles Johnson, William H. Bradley, Robert C. Jones, Robert Banks, Ted Lewis, Darin Kincaid, William Cummings, and a host of other employees. Ted Lewis and William H. Bradley were designated as key employees after the United Technologies purchase. Paluck left Mostek to work with Sevin-Rosen Partners and Convex Computer. Bradley designed all of the custom products based on the single- chip-calculator platform, as well as the code for the wristwatch devices produced by Mostek for Bulova and other customers. For a short while, Paluck headed a joint venture called Mostek Hong Kong, a collaboration with Bulova for the production of high-end wristwatches based on Mostek designs. Mr. Bradley was an employee of that joint venture. As Mostek's focus was shifted to its DRAM products, the industrial and telecommunications products were ignored and their market share vanished. Microprocessor second sourcing deals Mostek MK3880P (Zilog Z80). With this foundation in calculator chips and high volume DRAM production, Mostek gained a reputation as a leading semiconductor \\"fabrication house\\" (fab) in the early 1970s. One of their more popular products was the Mostek 3870, which combined the two-chip Fairchild F8 (3850 + 3851) into a single chip, which they introduced in 1977. William H. Bradley designed a host of custom products based on the MK3870. Fairchild later licensed the 3870 back from Mostek. They also produced ROM chips on demand, as well as the chips powering the Hammond electronic organ. Mostek cut a deal with a startup, Zilog, in which Mostek provided fab resources to manufacture the Zilog microprocessors in return for second sourcing rights to the Zilog family. Mostek produced MK3880, the Zilog Z80 and a series of Z80 support chips, until Zilog built their own fab. The Z80 eventually became the most popular microcomputer family as it was used in millions of embedded devices as well as in many home computers and computers using the de facto standard CP/M operating system, such as the Osborne, Kaypro, and TRS-80 models. When Vin Prothro, President, and L. J. Sevin, Chairman of the Board, discovered that Zilog had modified the recipe for Z80 chips to keep the yields low, thereby buying Zilog time to build their own fabs, Mostek sought a new microprocessor partner. They negotiated a deal with Intel to gain second sourcing rights to the Intel 8086 microprocessor family and the future x86 designs. After Sevin left to become a venture capitalist (founding Compaq and many other companies), Prothro signed another pivotal deal with Motorola to gain the rights to the Motorola 68000 and VME computers. The Intel x86 microprocessors would go on to become the brains for the IBM PC, while the Motorola 68000 would become the heart of the Apple Macintosh line. Mostek had secured the rights to every microprocessor family that would be important for the next 25 years. However, Mostek chose not to aggressively follow-up its entry into microprocessors—instead maintaining its concentration on the highly competitive (and thereby unprofitable) DRAM business. Decline in the face of Asian competition Mostek merged with United Technologies in 1979 to prevent an unfriendly takeover from Gould at the 10th anniversary of the company's founding, when a large block of stock options controlled by Sprague stock became vested. United Technologies would go on to lose their investment. The leadership chosen for the semiconductor division did not appreciate the up- front investment required or the long time for ROI. They sacrificed the Mostek's leadership position in some markets, focusing on the DRAM basket. They eventually spent hundreds of millions trying to keep the company going during the various semiconductor and videogame crashes of the early 1980s, and eventually gave up and sold it to Thomson Semiconductor in 1985 for $71 million. Unfortunately the DRAM marketplace was the beachhead where Japanese firms would make their successful assault on the global semiconductor market. Mostek was unable to match the Japanese extremely aggressive pricing, and succumbed during a particularly brutal price war when Korean firms (including Samsung, now the world's largest electronics conglomerate) tried to beat the Japanese at their own game. Micron Technology (one of several Mostek spinoffs) would later bring suit to prove the Japanese memory manufacturers guilty of price dumping, but the ruling would be too late to save Mostek. Thomson proceeded to lay off 80% of the workforce in an attempt to return the company to profitability. The next year they merged with SGS-ATES to become STMicroelectronics, based in Geneva, Switzerland. Although by this time most of Mostek's designs were no longer commercially viable, their DRAM patents turned out to be valuable and STM started a series of lawsuits to collect royalties. Between 1987 and 1993 STM made $450 million on these licenses alone. Spinoffs Jerry Rogers founded Cyrix in 1988 to capitalize on the Mostek second source agreement that allowed any 80X86 processor to be legally copied, which Intel attempted to stop via lawsuits. Eventually, after losing many legal battles, Intel simply changed the name of the 80586 to the Pentium, thereby ending the agreement. Micron Technology was a very successful spinoff founded by a handful of Mostek employees, including Ward Parkinson, Dennis Wilson, and Doug Pitman. Sevin Rosen Funds co-founded by LJ Sevin who was also the co-founder of Mostek and CEO. Sevin Rosen funded Compaq Computers, Cyrix, Convex Computers and more.

The Indian Plate includes most of South Asia—i.e. the Indian subcontinent—and a portion of the basin under the Indian Ocean, including parts of South China and western Indonesia,Sinvhal, Understanding Earthquake Disasters, p. 52, Tata McGraw-Hill Education, 2010, Harsh K. Gupta, Disaster management, p. 85, Universities Press, 2003, and extending up to but not including Ladakh, Kohistan and Balochistan.M.

M. Celâl Şengör, Tectonic evolution of the Tethyan Region, Springer, 1989, Plate movements Due to plate tectonics, the India Plate split from Madagascar and collided (c. 55 Mya) with the Eurasian Plate, resulting in the formation of the Himalayas. Until roughly , the Indian Plate formed part of the supercontinent Gondwana together with modern Africa, Australia, Antarctica, and South America. Gondwana broke up as these continents drifted apart at different velocities, a process which led to the opening of the Indian Ocean. In the late Cretaceous, approximately and subsequent to the splitting off from Gondwana of conjoined Madagascar and India, the Indian Plate split from Madagascar. It began moving north, at about per year, and is believed to have begun colliding with Asia as early as , in the Eocene epoch of the Cenozoic. However, some authors suggest the collision between India and Eurasia occurred much later, around . If the collision occurred between 55 and 50 Mya, the Indian Plate would have covered a distance of , moving more quickly than any other known plate. In 2012, paleomagnetic data from the Greater Himalaya was used to propose two collisions to reconcile the discrepancy between the amount of crustal shortening in the Himalaya (~) and the amount of convergence between India and Asia (~). These authors propose a continental fragment of northern Gondwana rifted from India, traveled northward, and initiated the \\"soft collision\\" between the Greater Himalaya and Asia at ~50 Mya. This was followed by the \\"hard collision\\" between India and Asia occurred at ~25 Mya. Subduction of the resulting ocean basin that formed between the Greater Himalayan fragment and India explains the apparent discrepancy between the crustal shortening estimates in the Himalaya and paleomagnetic data from India and Asia. However, the proposed ocean basin was not constrained by paleomagnetic data from the key time interval of ~120 Mya to ~60 Mya. New paleomagnetic results of this critical time interval from southern Tibet do not support this Greater Indian Ocean basin hypothesis and the associated dual collision model. In 2007, German geologists suggested the reason the Indian Plate moved so quickly is that it is only half as thick () as the other platesThe lithospheric roots in South Africa, Australia, and Antarctica are thick. () See also which formerly constituted Gondwana. The mantle plume that once broke up Gondwana might also have melted the lower part of the Indian subcontinent, which allowed it to move both more quickly and further than the other parts. The remains of this plume today form the Marion Hotspot (Prince Edward Islands), the Kerguelen hotspot, and the Réunion hotspots. As India moved north, it is possible the thickness of the Indian Plate degenerated further as it passed over the hotspots and magmatic extrusions associated with the Deccan and Rajmahal Traps. The massive amounts of volcanic gases released during the passage of the Indian Plate over the hotspots have been theorised to have played a role in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, generally held to be due to a large asteroid impact. The collision with the Eurasian Plate along the boundary between India and Nepal formed the orogenic belt that created the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalaya Mountains, as sediment bunched up like earth before a plow. The Indian Plate is currently moving north-east at per year, while the Eurasian Plate is moving north at only per year. This is causing the Eurasian Plate to deform, and the Indian Plate to compress at a rate of per year. Geography The westerly side of the Indian Plate is a transform boundary with the Arabian Plate called the Owen Fracture Zone, and a divergent boundary with the African Plate called the Central Indian Ridge (CIR). The northerly side of the Plate is a convergent boundary with the Eurasian Plate forming the Himalaya and Hindu Kush mountains.

It is given by injection into a muscle or under the skin. Common side effects include hot flashes, unstable mood, trouble sleeping, headaches, and pain at the site of injection. Other side effects may include high blood sugar, allergic reactions, and problems with the pituitary gland. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Leuprorelin is in the gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue family of medications. It works by decreasing gonadotropin and therefore decreasing testosterone and estradiol. Leuprorelin was patented in 1973 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1985. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is sold under the brand name Lupron among others. Medical use Leuprorelin may be used in the treatment of hormone-responsive cancers such as prostate cancer and breast cancer. It may also be used for estrogen- dependent conditions such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids. It may be used for precocious puberty in both males and females, and to prevent premature ovulation in cycles of controlled ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF). It may be used to reduce the risk of premature ovarian failure in women receiving cyclophosphamide for chemotherapy. Along with triptorelin and goserelin, it has been used to delay puberty in transgender youth until they are old enough to begin hormone replacement therapy. Researchers have recommended puberty blockers after age 12, when the person has developed to Tanner stages 2–3, and then cross-sex hormones treatment at age 16. This use of the drug is off-label, however, not having been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and without data on long-term effects of this use.Dreger, A. (2009, Jan.-Feb.). Gender Identity Disorder in childhood: Inconclusive advice to parents. Hastings Center Report, pp. 26-29. They are also sometimes used as alternatives to antiandrogens like spironolactone and cyproterone acetate for suppressing testosterone production in transgender women. It is considered a possible treatment for paraphilias. Leuprorelin has been tested as a treatment for reducing sexual urges in pedophiles and other cases of paraphilia. Side effects Common side effects of leuprorelin injection include redness/burning/stinging/pain/bruising at the injection site, hot flashes (flushing), increased sweating, night sweats, tiredness, headache, upset stomach, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, breast swelling or tenderness, acne, joint/muscle aches or pain, trouble sleeping (insomnia), reduced sexual interest, vaginal discomfort/dryness/itching/discharge, vaginal bleeding, swelling of the ankles/feet, increased urination at night, dizziness, breakthrough bleeding in a female child during the first two months of leuprorelin treatment, weakness, chills, clammy skin, skin redness, itching, or scaling, testicle pain, impotence, depression, or memory problems. The rates of gynecomastia with leuprorelin have been found to range from 3 to 16%. Pharmacology=Mechanism of action Leuprorelin is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue acting as an agonist at pituitary GnRH receptors. Agonism of GnRH receptors initially results in the stimulation of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion by the anterior pituitary ultimately leading to increased serum estradiol and testosterone levels via the normal physiology of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis); however, because propagation of the HPG axis is incumbent upon pulsatile hypothalamic GnRH secretion, pituitary GnRH receptors become desensitised after several weeks of continuous leuprorelin therapy. This protracted downregulation of GnRH receptor activity is the targeted objective of leuprorelin therapy and ultimately results in decreased LH and FSH secretion, leading to hypogonadism and thus a dramatic reduction in estradiol and testosterone levels regardless of sex. In the treatment of prostate cancer, the initial increase in testosterone levels associated with the initiation of leuprorelin therapy is counterproductive to treatment goals. This effect is avoided with concurrent utilisation of 5α-reductase inhibitors, such as finasteride, or flutamide which function to block the downstream effects of testosterone. Available forms Leuprorelin is available in the following forms, among others: * Short-acting daily intramuscular injection (Lupron): 5 mg/mL (2.8 mL) used as 1 mg every day. * Long-acting depot intramuscular injection (Lupron Depot): 7.5 mg once a month, 22.5 mg every 3 months, or 30 mg every 4 months. * Long-acting depot subcutaneous injection (Eligard): 7.5 mg once a month, 22.5 mg every 3 months, 30 mg every 4 months, or 45 mg every 6 months. * Long-acting subcutaneous injection (Fensolvi): 45 mg every 6 months. * Long-acting subcutaneous implant (Viadur): 65 mg pellet once every 12 months. Chemistry The peptide sequence is Pyr-His-Trp-Ser- Tyr-D-Leu-Leu-Arg-Pro-NHEt (Pyr = L-Pyroglutamyl). History Leuprorelin was discovered and first patented in 1973 and was introduced for medical use in 1985.

However, there is no scientifically valid or reliable research to show its effectiveness in treating autism. This use has been termed the \\"Lupron protocol\\" and Mark Geier, the proponent of the hypothesis, has frequently been barred from testifying in vaccine-autism related cases on the grounds of not being sufficiently expert in that particular issue\\"John and Jane Doe v.

The name refers to Haman, the villain in the Purim story. In Hebrew, hamantashen are known as , oznei Haman, 'Haman's ears'. The shape is achieved by folding in the sides of a circular piece of dough similar to a shortbread, with a filling placed in the center. Hamantashen are made with many different fillings, which are traditionally sweet (although savory varieties have become popular as well), including mohn (poppy seed, the oldest and most traditional variety), lekvar (prune jam), nut, date, apricot, raspberry, raisins, apple, vanilla pastry cream with chocolate chips cherry, fig, chocolate, dulce de leche, halva, caramel, or cheese. Their formation varies from hard similar to a shortbread to soft doughy casings. Etymology Four hamantashen: (clockwise from top left) chocolate, poppy seed, blueberry, and cherry. In Yiddish, the word homentash is singular, while homentashen is the plural form. However, hamantashen is the more common word form among English speakers, even when referring to a single pastry (for example, \\"I ate a poppy seed hamantashen\\"). Name and symbolism Hamantash is also spelled hamentasch, homentash, homentasch, homentaschan, or even (h)umentash. The name hamantash is commonly viewed as a reference to Haman, the villain of Purim, as described in the Book of Esther. The pastries are supposed to symbolize the defeated enemy of the Jewish people.Purim, Jewish Encyclopedia, 1906, 'In this connection it may be mentioned that for the celebration of Purim there developed among the Jews a special kind of baking. Cakes were shaped into certain forms and were given names having some symbolic bearing on the historical events of Purim. Thus the Jews of Germany eat \\"Hamantaschen\\" and \\"Hamanohren\\" (in Italy, \\"orrechi d'Aman\\"), \\"Kreppchen,\\" \\"Kindchen,\\" etc.' The word tash means \\"pouch\\" or \\"pocket\\" in Yiddish, and thus may refer to Haman's pockets, symbolizing the money that Haman offered to Ahasuerus in exchange for permission to destroy the Jews. In Hebrew, tash means \\"weaken\\", and the hamantash may celebrate the weakening of Haman and the hope that God will weaken all of the enemies of the Jews. Another possible source of the name is a folk etymology: the Yiddish word מאָן־טאַשן (montashn) for a traditional delicacy, literally meaning \\"poppyseed pouch\\",MyJewishLearning.com - Holidays: Purim Foods was transformed to hamantaschen, likely by association with Haman or inclusion of the Hebrew article (). In Israel, hamantaschen are called oznei Haman (), Hebrew for \\"Haman's ears\\" in reference to their defeated enemy's ears. The reason for the three-sided shape is uncertain. There is an old legend that Haman wore a three-cornered hat. Alternatively, the Midrash says that when Haman recognized the merit of the Three Patriarchs, his strength immediately weakened. Naked Archaeologist documentarian Simcha Jacobovici has shown the resemblance of hamantaschen to dice from the ancient Babylonian Royal Game of Ur, thus suggesting that the pastries are meant to symbolize the pyramidal shape of the dice cast by Haman in determining the day of destruction for the Jews. A simpler explanation is that the shape derives from traditional Jewish baking techniques in Central Europe for folding dough so as to form a pouch around a filling, also common for making dumplings. It has also been suggested that the shape is a representation of female reproductive organs, and that the poppy- seed filling is a fertility symbol. Sweet fillings Sweet hamantaschen fillings range from the traditional such as mohn/poppy seed, lekvar/prune, apricot jam, and also date which is especially popular in Israel. Prune Prune hamantaschen was invented in 1731 by David Brandeis of Jung-Bunzlau, Bohemia. The daughter of a Christian bookbinder purchased from Brandeis povidl (plum jam) which she claimed had made her family ill; as her father coincidentally died a few days after eating it. The burgomaster of the city ordered the closure of Brandeis' store and imprisoned him, his wife, and son for selling poisonous food to Christians. Investigations by municipal authorities and the court of appeal in Prague revealed that the bookbinder had died of consumption and the charges were dismissed. Brandeis wrote a scroll which he called Shir HaMa'alot l'David (\\"A Song of Ascents to David\\"), to be read on 10 Adar, accompanied by a festive meal. He was freed from prison four days before Purim after the charges against him were proven to be false, and in celebration of his release, Jews from his city celebrated with povidl or plum hamantaschen. Vanilla pastry cream with chocolate chips Hamantash filled with vanilla pastry cream and chocolate chips prior to baking. Israeli baker Uri Scheft offers hamantaschen filled with a vanilla pastry cream and chocolate chips at Lehamim/Breads Bakery, his bakeries in Tel Aviv and New York City. A recipe for this filling is also featured in Scheft's cookbook. Savory fillings Savory hamantaschen fillings have emerged in recent years, and their popularity has grown and are commonly prepared at home but can also be found in various Jewish bakeries and restaurants serving Jewish cuisine. Savory varieties may have fillings such as pizza, spinach and feta, lamb, potato, or cheese, and are often somewhat similar to other Jewish pastries such as the knish, bourekas, and sambusak. Preparation Volunteers in Israel preparing hamantaschen for Purim with the children of fallen soldiers. Poppy seed hamantaschen prior to baking. Sweet hamantaschen are typically made with a dough containing butter or, less-commonly a pareve dough containing oil. Depending on the ingredients used in the dough, the consistency of the finished hamantaschen can range from dry and crumbly like to a shortbread, to soft and cakey like a black and white cookie, to firm and crisp like a butter cookie. The dough is generally prepared with flour, eggs, sugar, butter (or margarine or cooking oil), and a flavoring such as vanilla (or sometimes cocoa, rose water, or orange blossom water may be used); sometimes milk is used in the dough, and sometimes a leavener such as baking powder or baking soda is added as well. The dough is then mixed gently so as to incorporate all the ingredients together but not make the dough tough and give the hamantaschen an inferior texture. Hamantaschen served at a Purim party in Dresden that have been dusted with powdered sugar. The dough is allowed to rest in the refrigerator and is then removed and rolled out to a thickness of between 1/8 and 1/4 of an inch; rounds of dough are stamped out and are often brushed with an egg wash to encourage sealing prior to the addition of the filling. The most popular filling is poppyseed, but apricot, prune, strawberry, raspberry, chocolate, peanut butter and jelly, and others are also common. The bottom and the top two corners of the dough are folded inward but do not fully enclose the filling, allowing it to remain visible. Sometimes hamantaschen may be frozen for a short period of time after shaping in order to prevent leakage of the filling. Then they are baked in an oven at medium heat for a short duration of time. Sometimes after baking hamantaschen may be dusted with confectioner's sugar, dipped in melted chocolate, or topped with sprinkles. Savory hamantaschen are prepared in much the same way as sweet hamantaschen, with the exception of the fillings; and they are generally made with a different dough, such one similar to a pie crust or puff pastry, or a modified sweet hamantaschen dough containing less sugar. Hamantashen in Israel Bakers selling hamantaschen as part of Purim celebrations at Machne Yehuda in Jerusalem, Israel. IDF Logistics Corps as part of a baking competition hosted by a winner of the Masterchef Israel television series. Hamantaschen are known as \\"oznei haman\\" in Israel, and are the most popular cookie sold at bakeries across Israel in the weeks leading up to the celebration of Purim each year, with both large chains and small independent bakeries offering many different varieties. As in the diaspora, poppyseed remains the most-popular filling, with chocolate in second, and date filling coming in third in popularity. Jam is not nearly as common a filling as in America. Each year bakeries offer new, innovative flavors of hamantaschen. Roladin, a popular Israeli bakery chain offers oznei haman with fillings such as goat cheese and onion jam, amaretto-pistachio-marzipan, and triple-sec cheesecake, among others. In 2017, Roladin announced that they were launching a dozen new flavors as well as reinvented versions of the more traditional fillings, and projected that they would sell over 2 million oznei haman during the Purim season. Lehamim Bakery, which has locations in Tel Aviv and New York City offers fillings such as sweet potato and feta, charoset, vanilla pastry cream with chocolate chips, apple, marzipan, and others. Oren Becker, an Israeli pastry chef has started making gluten free, vegan low or no-sugar, and low fat hamantaschen, and has said his personal favorite is made with a whole grain dough and filled with goji berries.

Eleven eclogues have been handed down to us under his name, of which the last four, from metrical considerations and express manuscript testimony, are now generally attributed to Nemesianus, who lived in the time of the emperor Carus and his sons (latter half of the 3rd century). The separate authorship of the eclogues of Calpurnius and Nemesianus was established by Haupt.  Controversy over date  There is no doubt that Calpurnius's eclogues post-date Virgil’s eclogues, as Calpurnius is heavily indebted, and frequently alludes to Virgil. However, the period in which Calpurnius was active has been debated and there is no overriding consensus. Edward Gibbon placed him in the reign of Carus (282 – 283 AD). In the late nineteenth century, Haupt asserted that Calpurnius wrote during the reign of Nero (54 – 68 AD).Haupt, M. (1854) De Carminibus Bucolicis Calpurnii et Nemesiani. Evidence put forward for this Neronian dating includes the fact that, in Calpurnius's eclogues I, IV, and VII, the emperor is described as a handsome youth, like Mars and Apollo, whose accession marks the beginning of a new golden age, prognosticated by the appearance of a comet, which is argued to be the same that appeared some time before the death of Claudius; he exhibits splendid games in the amphitheatre (probably the wooden amphitheatre erected by Nero in 57); and in the words maternis causam qui vicit Iulis (i.45) there is a reference to the speech delivered in Greek by Nero on behalf of the Ilienses (Suetonius, Nero, 7; Tacitus, Annals, xii.58), from whom the Julii derived their family. In 1978 it was argued that Calpurnius was active in the reign of Severus (193 – 211 AD).Champlin, E. (1978) The Life and Times of Calpurnius Siculus, JRS 68: 95 -110. Arguments for such later dating of Calpurnius's work are based on internal stylistic, metrical and lexical grounds\\"Calpurnius Siculus\\" Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd edition – including what are considered by some to be allusions in Calpurnius's poetry to Flavian-era literature. There has been subsequent disagreement among scholars as to the date of Calpurnius's poetry, with some arguing for a Neronian Date,Townend, G.B. (1980) \\"Calpurnius Siculus and the Munus Neronis\\", JRS 70:166-74; Mayer, R. (1980) \\"Calpurnius Siculus: Technique and Date\\", JRS 70: 175-76. others for a later date.Armstrong, D. (1986) \\"Stylistics and the Date of Calpurnius Siculus\\", Philologus 130: 113-36; Courtney, E. (1987) \\"Imitaion, Chronologie Litteraire et Calpurnius Siculus\\", REL 65: 148-57 Life Nothing is known of the life of Calpurnius with any certainty. Some scholars have argued that Calpurnius is represented, in his poetry, by the character of Corydon and have attempted to draw conclusions about Calpurnius's life from the life of Corydon portrayed in the eclogues. From this it is deduced that Calpurnius was in poor circumstances and was on the point of emigrating to Spain, when a patron (represented in the poems by a certain Meliboeus) came to his aid. Through his influence Calpurnius apparently secured a post at Rome. The poet's patron, has been variously identified with Columella, Seneca the philosopher, and Gaius Calpurnius Piso. Although the sphere of Meliboeus's literary activity (as indicated in Eclogue iv.53) suits none of these, what is known of Calpurnius Piso fits in well with what is said of Meliboeus by the poet, who speaks of his generosity, his intimacy with the emperor, and his interest in tragic poetry. His claim is further supported by the poem De Laude Pisonis (ed. C.F. Weber, 1859) which has come down to us without the name of the author, but which there is considerable reason for attributing to Calpurnius, the other main contender being Lucan. Eclogues The eclogues are a collection of Latin poetry attributed to Calpurnius Siculus. Of his models the chief is Virgil, of whom (under the name of Tityrus) he speaks with great enthusiasm; he is also indebted to Ovid and Theocritus.  Laus Pisonis and Einsiedlen Eclogues  The Laus Pisonis exhibits a striking similarity with Calpurnius's eclogues in metre, language, and subject-matter. The author of the Laus is young, of respectable family and desirous of gaining the favour of Piso as his Maecenas. Further, the similarity between the two names can hardly be accidental; it is suggested that the poet may have been adopted by the courtier, or that he was the son of a freedman of Piso. The attitude of the author of the Laus towards the subject of the panegyricus seems to show less intimacy than the relations between Corydon and Meliboeus in the eclogues, and there is internal evidence that the Laus was written during the reign of Claudius (Teuffel-Schwabe, Hist. of Rom. Lit. 306,6). Mention may here be made of the fragments of two short hexameter poems known as the Einsiedeln Eclogues, which share similarities with the poetry of Calpurnius. Further reading * H. E.

The film is both set and filmed in Utah, including at Dead Horse Point State Park, Arches National Park, Professor Valley in Moab as well as White's Ranch - Milepost 14 Utah Hwy 128, Moab (which was also a set for a number of other western films from the same era). The picture is an adaptation of the novel Warlock by American author Oakley Hall. Fonda portrays Clay Blaisedell, a freelance marshal in the fictional town of Warlock with implacable methods of dealing with troublemakers. A subplot centers on Blaisedell's club-footed assistant, Tom Morgan, played by Quinn, who has sublimated his relationships and ambition into a warped devotion to Blaisedell, the only person Morgan thinks does not look down on him for his disability. As in the earlier film Wichita (1955), the conflict of the law with the outlaw runs parallel to the resentment of the town's own leadership. Plot Warlock is a small Utah mining town of the early 1880s. Cowboys working for Abe McQuown often come into town, killing on a whim, and beating or humiliating any deputy sheriff who tries to stand up to them. The Citizens' Committee decides to hire Clay Blaisedell, a renowned gunfighter, as town marshal in spite of the misgivings of some, such as old Judge Holloway. The town is not incorporated and does not have authority to have its own marshal. Blaisedell arrives with his devoted clubfooted friend, Tom Morgan, an expert gunman as well. Morgan has a reputation as a heavy-drinking gambler, but Blaisedell insists that he is part of the package. Their first encounter with McQuown's men is without bloodshed. The cowboys are intimidated by Blaisedell, and one, Johnny Gannon, stays behind, because he has become sick of their murderous ways. Morgan learns that his old flame, Lily Dollar, is coming to town on the stagecoach, accompanied by Bob Nicholson, brother of Big Ben Nicholson, who was recently killed by Blaisedell. Lily had left Morgan for Big Ben and knows that Morgan pushed Ben into challenging Blaisedell, who killed him. She wants Blaisedell dead to punish Morgan. Morgan sets out to meet the stagecoach, but sees from a distance it being robbed by some of McQuown's men. He takes advantage of the situation to kill Bob Nicholson unseen. Lily arrives in town and sees Morgan there. She believes that he pulled the trigger. The robbers are arrested without incident by Blaisedell and a posse. Before taking them to Bright City for trial, the sheriff, who disapproves of Blaisedell, accepts Gannon's offer to become Warlock's new resident deputy. The robbers, one of whom is Gannon's younger brother Billy, are cleared by a jury intimidated by McQuown. The cowboys, led by Billy, immediately confront Blaisedell and Morgan in the street. Deputy Gannon asks them to leave and tells Billy, \\"I ain't backin' him, because you're my brother, and I ain't backin' you, because you're wrong.\\" A cowboy tries to shoot Blaisedell in the back, but is spotted by Morgan and shot. Blaisedell kills two others, including Billy, after giving him a chance to back down. McQuown's smooth-talking man Curley posts wanted notices for Blaisedell, declaring the cowboys \\"regulators\\" in mockery of his quasi-legal status. Gannon vows to stop any regulators who come into town, and McQuown angrily stabs him in his gun hand. Townspeople begin resenting Blaisedell and Morgan, exactly as Blaisedell had predicted. However, he has started a relationship with Jessie Marlow and decides to marry and settle down, much to the surprise of Morgan, who wants to move on. Despite his injured hand, Gannon faces the cowboys alone after Morgan pulls a gun on Blaisedell, who had volunteered to back the deputy. With help from the citizens and from Curley, who promised him \\"a fair fight\\", Gannon unexpectedly kills McQuown and breaks up the regulators for good. Morgan cannot tolerate the idea that Gannon is now more of a hero than Blaisedell, and he resents Lily's attraction to the deputy, too. In the course of an argument, Blaisedell learns the truth about the deaths of the Nicholson brothers and turns his back on Morgan. That evening, in a drunken state, Morgan calls Gannon out, intending to kill him. Blaisedell locks Deputy Gannon in his own cell, insisting, \\"Tom Morgan's my responsibility.\\" Initially content to seem cowed, Morgan is pleased Blaisedell is a hero again, but when townspeople jeer and mock Morgan as he walks away, he challenges Blaisedell to a showdown. Morgan shoots off Blaisedell's hat before being fatally wounded a split-second later. Morgan's dying words are, \\"I won, Clay, I won!\\" A grief-stricken Blaisedell carries his friend's body into the saloon, which he burns down. Gannon tells Blaisedell that he will arrest him in the morning if he does not leave town. Blaisedell decides to leave. Jessie refuses to accompany him. The next day, Gannon and Blaisedell face one another. Blaisedell outdraws Gannon, but then throws his famous golden-handled revolvers into the sand, smiles at Gannon and rides away.

It was most closely related to the American mink (Neovison vison), with continuing debate about whether or not the sea mink should be considered a subspecies of the American mink (making it Neovison vison macrodon) or a species of its own. The main justification for a separate species designation is the size difference between the two minks, but other distinctions have been made, such as its redder fur. The only known remains are bone fragments unearthed in Native American shell middens. Its actual size is speculative, based largely on tooth remains. The sea mink was first described in 1903, after its extinction; information regarding its external appearance and habits stem from speculation and from accounts made by fur traders and Native Americans. It may have exhibited behavior similar to the American mink, in that it probably maintained home ranges, was polygynandrous, and had a similar diet, though more seaward-oriented. It was probably found on the New England coast and the Maritime Provinces, though its range may have stretched further south during the last glacial period. Conversely, its range may have been restricted solely to the New England coast, specifically the Gulf of Maine, or just to the nearby islands. The largest of the minks, the sea mink was more desirable to fur traders and became extinct in the late 19th or early 20th century. Taxonomy and etymology alt=A wet American mink with pale brown fur, dark brown eyes, long fingers, and a skinny tail. Its head is turned to the right and it is standing on a rock next to water. The sea mink was first described as Lutreola macrodon, distinct from the American mink, by Daniel Webster Prentiss, a medical doctor and ornithologist, in 1903 after it became extinct. Prentiss based his description on skull fragments recovered from Native American shell middens in New England. Most sea mink remains, nearly all of them skull fragments, have come from shell middens, but a complete specimen has never been found. Debate has occurred regarding whether the sea mink was its own species, or another subspecies of the American mink. Those who argue that the sea mink was a subspecies often refer to it as Neovison vison macrodon. A study in 1911 by Frederic Brewster Loomis, an American paleontologist, concluded that the differences between the American mink and the sea mink were too minute to justify the latter's classification as a separate species, and he named it Lutreola vison antiquus. A study conducted in 2000 by Mead et al. refuted Loomis by claiming that the size range for the largest sea mink specimen was beyond that of the American mink, thereby making it a separate species. But a 2001 study by Graham concluded that this size difference was insufficient evidence to classify the sea mink as its own species and that it should be considered a subspecies. Graham supposed that the size difference was caused by environmental factors. Furthermore, Graham reported that Mead assumed the smaller mink specimens to be the American mink, and the larger mink specimens outside the range of the American mink to be sea minks; this may have been a case of sexual dimorphism wherein all specimens were sea minks, the larger ones being males and the smaller ones being females. A 2007 study compared the dental makeup of the sea mink to the American mink, and concluded that they were distinct enough to be considered two separate species. The taxonomy of the minks was revised in 2000, resulting in the formation of a new genus, Neovison, which includes only the sea mink and the American mink. Formerly, both minks were classified in the genus Mustela. The species name macrodon translates to \\"large teeth\\". According to Richard Manville, a naturalist who maintains that the sea mink is not a separate species, its closest relative is the common mink (N. v. mink), which also inhabits the New England area. Fur traders who hunted it gave the sea mink various names, including water marten, red otter, and fisher cat. Possibly the first description of this species was made by Sir Humphrey Gilbert in the late 1500s as \\"a fish like a greyhound\\", which was a reference to its affinity for the sea and its body shape and gait, which were apparently similar to that of a greyhound. It is possible that the fisher (Pekania pennanti) got its name from being mistakenly identified as the sea mink, which was also known as the fisher by fur traders. The Abnaki Indians referred to it as the \\"mousebeysoo\\", which means \\"wet thing\\". It was named \\"sea mink\\" because it was always found near the coast by fur traders, and subsequently the American mink was often referred to as the \\"wood mink\\". Range The sea mink was a marine mammal that lived around the rocky coasts of New England and the southernmost Maritime Provinces until it was hunted to extinction in the late 19th or early 20th century. Most sea mink remains are unearthed on the coast of Maine. Though it is speculated that they at one point inhabited Connecticut and Rhode Island, they were commonly trapped along the coast of the Bay of Fundy (in the Gulf of Maine), and it is said that they formerly existed on the southwestern coast of Nova Scotia. There were reports of unusually large mink furs being collected from Nova Scotia regularly. The bones of a specimen unearthed in Middleboro, Massachusetts, were dated to be around 4,300±300 years old, from salt water. The sea mink may have reached that area by traveling up rivers, or may have been brought there by Native Americans. The latter is most likely, as no other mink remains have been discovered between Casco Bay in Maine and southeastern Massachusetts. Sea mink bones have been unearthed in Canada, although these may have been carried there by Native Americans from the Gulf of Maine. The rugged shorelines of the Down East region of Maine may have represented a northernmost barrier in their range. Mead concluded that only American minks inhabited the mainland and that sea minks were restricted to islands off the coast. If this is the case, then all remains found on the mainland were carried there. Graham challenged that hypothesis, stating that it is unlikely that all sea mink specimens originate from one population. During the last glacial period, ending 12,000 years ago, the sea mink's range may have extended south of the Gulf of Maine. It may have even evolved there, as Maine at that time would have been covered in glaciers, although the oldest known specimen only dates back to around 5,000 years; this could be due to the rising sea levels—older sea mink remains may be submerged underwater. Alternately, the sea mink may have evolved after the last glacial period and filled a new ecological niche. Description alt=A pen-and-ink drawing of the upper teeth of a sea mink on the left, and that of an American mink on the right. The teeth of the sea mink are slightly but noticeably larger than that of the American mink. Since the sea mink has only been described by fragmentary remains, its appearance and behaviors are not well- documented. Its relatives, as well as descriptions by fur traders and Native Americans, give a general idea of this animal's appearance and its ecological roles. Accounts from Native Americans in the New England/Atlantic Canadian regions reported that the sea mink had a fatter body than the American mink. The sea mink produced a distinctive fishy odor, and had fur that was said to be coarser and redder than that of the American mink. It is thought that naturalist Joseph Banks encountered this animal in 1776 in the Strait of Belle Isle, and he described it as being slightly larger than a fox, having long legs, and a tail that was long and tapered towards the end, similar to a greyhound. The sea mink was the largest of the minks. As only fragmentary skeletal remains of the sea mink exist, most of its external measurements are speculative and rely only on dental measurements. In 1929, Ernest Thompson Seton, a wildlife artist, concluded that the probable dimensions for this animal are from head to tail, with the tail being long. A possible mounted sea mink specimen collected in 1894 in Connecticut measured from head to tail and the tail was in length; a 1996 study found this to be either a large American mink or possibly a hybrid. The specimen was described as having coarse fur that was reddish-tan in color, though much of it was likely faded from age. It was darkest at the tail and the hind limbs, with a white patch between the forearms. There were also white spots on the left forearm and the groin region. Palatal aspect of the skull from the type specimenalt=A pen-and-ink drawing of the upper portion of the mouth (inside view) of a sea mink. The left side of the drawing (i.e., the right side of the mouth) has teeth drawn in, whereas the right side of the drawing (i.e., the left side of its mouth) has teeth sockets drawn in. The front teeth in between the canines are all drawn in. The type specimen was collected by Prentiss and Frederick True, a biologist, in 1897 in Brooklin, Maine, the remains of which consist of a maxilla, parts of the nasal bone, and the palate. The teeth are all present on the right side of the palate, and the left side consists of the incisors and one premolar. Other than a chipped canine, all the teeth are in good condition. The specimen is apparently larger than the Alaskan mink (N. v. nesolestes), as the average distance between the last incisor to the first molar is in the Alaskan mink, whereas that distance is in the type specimen. The nasal bone has an abrupter ascension, and the carnassial teeth make a more acute angle with the gums than those of the common mink (N. v. mink). These minks were large and heavily built, with a low sagittal crest and short, wide postorbital processes (projections on the frontal bone behind the eye sockets). In fact, the most notable characteristic of the skull was its size, in that it was clearly larger than that of other mink species, having a wide rostrum, large nostril openings, large antorbital fenestrae (openings in the skull in front of the eye socket), and large teeth. Their large size was probably in response to their coastal environment, as the largest extant subspecies of American mink, the Alaskan mink (N. v. nesolestes), inhabits the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska, an area with a habitat similar to the Gulf of Maine. Mead, concluding that the mink was restricted to nearshore islands, suggested that the large size was due to insular gigantism. Since almost all members of the subfamily Mustelinae exhibit sexual dimorphism, male sea minks were probably larger than female sea minks. The sea mink's wider carnassial teeth and blunter carnassial blades suggest that they crushed hard shells more often than did the teeth of the American mink. Behavior intertidal predator of the Gulf of Maine.alt=A sandy beach at dusk the sand on the bottom half, and the water and the horizon on the top half. There's a group of people walking across the shoreline, and on the right side of the picture there's a rock formation jutting upwards from the sand with evergreen trees on it As marine mammal species often play a large part in their ecosystems, it is possible that the sea mink was an important intertidal predator. It may have been similar in diet to the American mink, and may have consumed seabirds, seabird eggs, and hard-bodied marine invertebrates, though in greater proportions. Fur traders reported that sea mink dens had two entrances, and were made in the rocks piled up by the waves. Remains of toad sculpins and ocean pout were the most common around their dens, and garden banded snails were also reported to have been part of their diet. Their seafood-oriented diet may have increased their size. According to fur traders, the sea mink was nocturnal and resided in caves and rock crevices during the day. Due to the overlap of American mink and sea mink ranges, it is possible that they hybridized with each other. Although not a truly marine species, being confined to coastal waters, the sea mink was unusually aquatic compared to other members of Musteloidea, being, next to otters, the most aquatic member of the taxon. Like other minks, individual sea minks may have maintained home ranges, and since the males were larger and required more food, males would have had larger territorial claims. Likewise, their larger size may have allowed the males to target larger prey than the females, and they may have had to defend females during mating seasons. Like other weasels, the sea mink was probably polygynandrous, with both sexes mating with multiple individuals. Exploitation and extinction alt=A gully surrounded by low- lying leafy plants and trees. The bottom of the gully is filled with shells, and it leads to a lake The sea mink was pursued by fur traders due to its large size; this made it more desirable than other mink species further inland. The unregulated fur trade eventually led to its extinction, which is thought to have occurred between 1860 and 1920. The sea mink was seldom sighted after 1860. The last two recorded kills of a sea mink were made in Maine in 1880 near Jonesport, Maine, and Campobello Island, New Brunswick, in 1894, although the 1894 kill is speculated to be of large American minks. Fur traders made traps to catch sea minks and also pursued them with dogs, although they were rarely trapped. If a sea mink escaped into a small hole on the rocky ledges, it was dug out by hunters using shovels and crowbars. If it was out of reach of the hunters, it was shot and then retrieved using an iron rod with a screw on the far end. If it was hiding, it was smoked out and suffocated. The minks' nocturnal behavior may have been caused from pressure by fur traders who hunted them in daylight. Since the remains of brain cases found in shell middens are broken and many of the bones found exhibit cut marks, it is assumed that the sea mink was hunted by Native Americans for food, and possibly for exchange and ceremonial purposes. One study looking at the remains in shell middens in Penobscot Bay reported that sea mink craniums were intact, more so than that of other animals found, implying that they were specifically placed there. Males were more often collected than females.

Enric Valor i Vives (; 1911 in Castalla, Alicante – 2000 in Valencia) was a Spanish narrator and grammarian who made one of the most important contributions to the re- collection and recovery of Valencian lexicography and its standardization in the Valencian Community, Spain. Biography Enric Valor was born in 1911, the son of an affluent family from Castalla, in the Valencian comarca of l'Alcoià. In 1930, at the age of nineteen, he became a journalist in Alicante writing in the satirical newspaper El Tio Cuc, in Valencian. During the Second Spanish Republic he started to become politically active. His main demand was for autonomous status for the Land of Valencia. He was also at this time working in the city of Valencia in the nationalist newspapers La República de les Lletres, El Camí and El País Valencià. When the Spanish Civil War broke out he supported the Spanish Republic. After the war, he cut back on his political activities to concentrate on literature. At the beginning of the 1950s he started to compile \\"rondalles\\", a type of folk narrative, which were published as Rondalles valencianes (1950–1958). During the 1960s he returned to underground political activities involving Valencian nationalism and, as a result, he became a political prisoner of Francisco Franco's Spanish State from 1966 to 1968. Once out of prison he founded almost the first magazine in Valencian in the postwar period; Gorg (\\"Whirl\\", in Valencian). When the Francoist State ended, Enric Valor was able to spread freely his opinions and literary works. He became honoured with many important literary and linguistic awards from all over the Països Catalans. During the 1990s there was a move among some Valencian cultural groups to propose Valor as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but it didn't come to fruit. Valor then died in 2000. Linguistic works His first linguistic work was in the weekly magazine El Tio Cuc based in Alicante. He was contributing to the development of the Catalan-Valencian-Balearic Dictionary (such a Catalan inter-dialectal dictionary) under the directorship of Francesc de Borja i Moll, which included a Southern Valencian lexicon. Like Carles Salvador and Sanchis Guarner, he was one of the principal promoters of the standardisation of Valencian by means of works such as Curs de la llengua valenciana (Gorg, 1961), Millorem el llenguatge (1971), and Curso medio de gramática catalana referida especialmente al País Valenciano (1973). In 1983 he released La flexió verbal where he summarized the widely dialectised Valencian verbs. This work became the principal reference for the normative use of verbs, and is used as essential teaching material for Valencian pupils. Literary works His most known work is Rondalles valencianes (1950–1958), where 36 valencian popular tales are collected as a literary narration. Other works with a similar style are Narracions de la Foia de Castalla (1953), and Meravelles i picardies (1964–1970). Valor was also a writer. His first novel was L'ambició d'Aleix which was started between the 1940s and 1950s, but it was being re-written until its release in 1960. Perhaps his most important novel work is Cicle de Cassana which is made up of three novels: Sense la terra promesa (1960), Temps de batuda (1983), and Enllà de l'horitzó (1991). The Cicle de Cassana trilogy aims for the regaining of collective memory between 1916 and 1939. In 1982 he published La idea de l'emigrant.

The term erythroplasia was coined by Louis Queyrat to describe a precancerous red lesion of the penis. This gave rise to the term erythoplasia of Queyrat. Depending upon the context, this term may refer specifically to carcinoma in situ of the glans penis or vulva appearing as a red patch, or may be used as a synonym of erythroplasia on other mucous membrane or transitional sites. It mainly affects the glans penis (the head of the penis), although uncommonly it may present on the mucous membranes of the larynx, and rarely, the mouth, or the anus. Erythroplakia is analogous to the term leukoplakia which describes white patches. Together, these are the 2 traditionally accepted types of premalignant lesion in the mouth, When a lesion contains both red and white areas, the term \\"speckled leukoplakia\\" or \\"eyrthroleukoplakia\\" is used. Although oral erythroplakia is much less common than leukoplakia, erythroplakia carries a significantly higher risk of containing dysplasia or carcinoma in situ, and of eventually transforming into invasive squamous cell carcinoma (a type of oral cancer).  Signs and symptoms  Although often the terms erythroplasia and erythroplakia are used synonymously, some sources distinguish them, stating that the latter is macular (flat) while the former is papular (bumpy). Erythroplakia of the genital mucosae is often referred to as erythroplasia of Queyrat. The most common areas in the mouth where erythroplakia is found are the floor of the mouth, buccal vestibule, the tongue, and the soft palate. It appears as a red macule or plaque with well- demarcated borders. The texture is characterized as soft and velvety. An adjacent area of leukoplakia may be found along with the erythroplakia. Erythroplasia may also occur on the laryngeal mucosa, or the anal mucosa.  Causes  Erythroplakia has an unknown cause but researchers presume it to be similar to the causes of squamous cell carcinoma. Carcinoma is found in almost 40% of erythroplakia.Ridge JA, Glisson BS, Lango MN, et al. \\"Head and Neck Tumors\\" in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach. 11 ed. 2008. It is mostly found in elderly men around the ages of 65 - 74. It is commonly associated with smoking. Alcohol and tobacco use have been described as risk factors.  Diagnosis =Differential diagnosis of an oral red lesion Erythroleukoplakia (\\"speckled leukoplakia\\"), left commissure. Biopsy showed mild epithelial dysplasia and candida infection. Antifungal medication may turn this type of lesion into a homogenous leukoplakia (i.e. the red areas would disappear) There are many other conditions that are similar in appearance and must be ruled out before a diagnosis of erythroplakia is made (see table). Sometimes, a diagnosis is delayed for up to two weeks in order to see if the lesion spontaneously regresses on its own or if another cause can be found. Erythroplakia frequently is associated with dysplasia, and is thus a precancerous lesion. Biopsy Microscopically, the tissue exhibits severe epithelial dysplasia, carcinoma-in-situ, or invasive squamous cell carcinoma in 90% of cases. There is an absence of keratin production and a reduced number of epithelial cells. Since the underlying vascular structures are less hidden by tissue, erythroplakia appears red when viewed in a clinical setting.  Treatment  Treatment involves biopsy of the lesion to identify extent of dysplasia. Complete excision of the lesion is sometimes advised depending on the histopathology found in the biopsy. Even in these cases, recurrence of the erythroplakia is common and, thus, long-term monitoring is needed. History In 1911, French dermatologist Louis Queyrat described a sharply defined, bright red, glistening velvety precancerous lesion of the glans penis. He coined the term \\"erythroplasie\\" to designate red plaques as an analogy to \\"leucoplasie\\", which designated white patches. Since \\"leucoplasie\\" was the equivalent of the English leukoplakia (coined in 1861), the term became erythroplakia in English. Similarly, the term leukoplakia was originally coined to describe white lesions of the urinary tract, and in 1877 was first applied to white patches in the mouth. It is unclear when the term erythroplakia was first adapted to describe red lesions in the mouth. Etymology The word erythroplakia means \\"red patch\\", and is derived from the Greek words ερυθρος - \\"red\\" and πλάξ - \\"plate\\" The World Health Organization defines oral erythroplakia as follows:  References  External links  Conditions of the mucous membranes Oral mucosal pathology ","title":"Erythroplakia"},{"id":"1336557","text":"Map showing Butare Province Butare was a province (prefecture) of Rwanda prior to its dissolution in January 2006. Butare city is the second largest city in Rwanda and one of the nation's former twelve provinces. It is located in south-central region of the country and borders Burundi to the south. It had a population of 77.449 as of January 2006.  Description  Butare was situated in the south west of the country and bordered Burundi. Its geography was in keeping with most of the rest of Rwanda, and was hilly compared to surrounding Tanzania, but not as mountainous as the North of Rwanda.  Genocide  During testimony at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) investigating the 1994 Rwandan genocide, expert André Guichaoua referred to Butare as the \\"rebel province.\\" Butare was the only prefecture to be run by a Tutsi, Jean-Baptiste Habyalimana, who actively opposed the genocide. Because it had a large Tutsi minority, prefectural politics were dominated by the Parti Social Démocrate (PSD), rather than the Mouvement Républicain National pour la Démocratie et le développement (MRND), from which the genocidal Interahamwe drew recruits. The Interahamwe in Butare were thus less numerous and less organized than their counterparts in the rest of country. When the country erupted into bloodshed following the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana (no relation to the prefect) on 6 April 1994, Butare was untouched, with the notable exception of the Nyakizu commune. Many Tutsis who fled the violence in other parts of country found haven in Butare. The calm lasted two weeks. Interim President Théodore Sindikubwabo, himself a native of Butare, appointed a new prefect on 19 April in a ceremony in the prefectural capital. Prefect Habyalimana was shortly thereafter arrested and killed. One of the next to die was former Queen Rosalie Gicanda, described by the ICTR prosecution as \\"a historical symbol for all Tutsi\\". Paramilitary units and Interahamwe were then airlifted from Kigali, signaling the start of the killing. It has been suggested that the Hutu government leadership were particularly concerned about Butare because so many of them were natives; besides Sindikubwabo, Prime Minister Jean Kambanda (the first person convicted by the ICTR), General Augustin Ndindiliyimana (head of the Gendarmie), and Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, the minister of women and family affairs were all born in Butare.

It was directed by John Sturges (with whom Widmark would also make another western The Law and Jake Wade), and unfolds in the vein of the psychological Western (a subgenre that has yielded many films, e.g. those of Anthony Mann, with whose films this bears comparison). It delivers an unconventional story, written by Borden Chase, that sometimes crosses into film noir, as a colorful cast of supporting characters help or hinder the protagonist during the unfolding of its central mystery. Backlash was filmed on location at Old Tucson Studios. Plot Jim Slater (Richard Widmark) meets Karyl Orton (Donna Reed) in Gila Valley, Arizona. She thinks that he is searching for a gold cache believed to hidden somewhere in the valley. When a man with a rifle starts shooting at him, Jim wonders if she can be trusted. After Jim kills his foe, he discovers the dead man was a deputy sheriff from Silver City. He takes the body there. When Sheriff J. C. Marson (Edward Platt) questions him, Jim reveals that he is after the person responsible for his father's death. Jim's father and four other men were besieged and killed by Apaches. Jim believes there was a sixth man who got away and could have gone for help, but instead decided he wanted the gold they found all to himself. Marston reveals that one of the men was the brother of the dead deputy. There are two other brothers, who will want revenge. When Jim refuses to leave town, Marston suggests he go see Sergeant George Lake (Barton MacLane) in Tucson. Lake led the detail that found the massacre victims. Jim takes his advice, but finds Lake and his men under siege at an isolated trading post. Lake tells Karyl that only three of the bodies could be identified. While there, Karyl stakes her claim to the gold; her husband was another victim of Gila Valley. Lake and Jim sneak out that night and stampede the Apaches' horses, allowing the party to escape. Lake, however, is mortally wounded. Before he dies, he reveals they found a horse bearing the brand of Carson's outfit in Texas. When Jim returns to Tucson, he encounters Karyl in a hotel, being forced upstairs by a stranger. Karyl calls him by name, whereupon the stranger draws his gun. Jim kills him and wounds another man gunning for him, though he himself is shot in the shoulder. Afterward, Karyl reveals that the dead man is Jeff Welker (Robert J. Wilke) and the survivor his brother Tony (Harry Morgan). Jim slaps her. She tracks him down, tends to his wound, and offers to trade information. Jim kisses her. When the pair reach their destination, Major Carson (Roy Roberts) tries to recruit Jim against Bonniwell (John McIntire), who has organized the local bandits. Jim is not interested in the upcoming range war, though he does learn that Bonniwell arrived in the region with $60,000, the same amount as the missing gold. One of Carson's gunmen, Johnny Cool (William Campbell), informs Bonniwell of Carson's plans. Bonniwell gathers his men in town, guns down Sheriff Olson (Robert Foulk) when he tries to keep the peace, and prepares an ambush. He finds Jim locked in the jail. He lets the prisoner out when he learns who he is, then reveals that he is Jim's father, whom Jim had not seen since he was a child. The gold came, not from mining, but via robbery. The others forced Bonniwell out, only to run afoul of the Apaches, leaving him to collect the gold. Disillusioned, Jim wants nothing to do with his father. Karyl pleads with Jim to leave immediately, but he wants to warn Carson. When he tries to fire a warning shot, he discovers that Bonniwell gave him back an unloaded gun. Bonniwell chases his son with a knife, but Jim manages to wrestle a gun from one of the bandits and fire. Alerted, Carson has his men surround the town, whereupon the bandits panic and flee. Bonniwell offers to step out of hiding and draw to see which Slater is faster, but he treacherously already has his gun in his hand. Carson's men ride in and fatally shoot him just before Jim steps out in the open.

Seliger was a former assistant theoretician professor Dr. Eugen Sänger. The company developed and built prototypes of sounding rockets and launched them near Cuxhaven. The BSFEGmbH cooperated strongly with the Hermann-Oberth- Gesellschaft, of which Berthold Seliger was a member. The first rocket developed by the BSFEGmbH was an improved version of the Kumulus, which was first launched on 19 November 1962 and reached a height of 50 kilometres. On 7 February 1963 the BSFEGmbH launched a two-stage rocket with a maximum height of 80 kilometres and, on 2 May 1963, they launched a three-stage rocket with a maximum flight height of more than 100 kilometres. The latter rocket may have attained the highest flight altitude of all rockets built in post-war Germany. The signals from all these rockets were also received at the observatory in Bochum (300 km SSW of Cuxhaven). After May 1963 the BSFEGmbH worked on the improvement of the steering system of their rockets and thought also on military usable rockets. On 5 December 1963 the BSFEGmbH gave a flight demonstration of their rockets to military staff of non-NATO-countries. Although their rockets were launched with reduced amount of propellant in order not to violate Allied laws concerning the development of military rockets in Germany and were not fit for military use, the rocket experiments of the Hermann-Oberth-Gesellschaft e.V. and the BSFEGmbH after this date were viewed with great suspicion. In 1964, these experiments were discontinued with a temporary injunction, which is still valid today, after a fatal accident at a rocket demonstration by Gerhard Zucker at Braunlage, although Gerhard Zucker did not cooperate with the BSFEGmbH or the Hermann-Oberth-Gesellschaft e.V. in any way and also had a bad reputation with the members of these societies.

The Society was established in 1952 by Karl Poggensee in Bremen as the German Agency For Affairs of Space Travel (DAFRA), tasked to develop civilian rockets. Early on in Hespenbusch, near Großenkneten, various prototype rockets were developed, which soon reached heights of a few kilometers. The available area in Hespenbusch quickly became too small to continue to conduct rocket tests there. In 1957 the rocket experiments of DAFRA, which was renamed the DRG (German rocket company), moved to Cuxhaven, where rocket tests were resumed in 1959. On December 15, 1960, the first launch of the Kumulus, which had a maximum height of 20 kilometres, took place and on September 16, 1961, the first launch of the Cirrus, which had a maximum height of 50 kilometers, took place. At this time Berthold Seliger began to build rockets in this society, which was renamed the Hermann Oberth society. In 1961 Berthold Seliger created his own company, the Seliger Forschungs- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH, which cooperated with the Hermann Oberth society. The Seliger Forschungs- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH developed several two- and three-stage rockets, which could reach heights of up to 150 kilometers, between 1962 and 1963. After a disputed flight demonstration of the Seliger Forschungs- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH militarily usable rockets before military representatives from non-NATO states at Cuxhaven on December 5, 1963, a break between the Seliger Forschungs- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH and the Hermann Oberth society occurred. The latter continued to make rocket launches until June 1964. After the termination of rocket launches in the Cuxhaven area the Hermann Oberth society put its emphasis on the education of future space technology engineers. In 1993 the Hermann Oberth society and the Otto Lilienthal society united to form the German Society for Air and Space Technology, DGLR.

A right-handed batsman, he played 35 Test matches for England, as captain in 22 of those games, and led the team to defeat in four Ashes series against Australia. An amateur, MacLaren played first-class cricket for Lancashire, captaining that county for most of his career. As a batsman, MacLaren was one of the leading cricketers of his time and had a reputation as a fast-scoring stylist. In 1895, he scored 424 runs in an innings against Somerset which was the highest individual score in first-class cricket until 1923 and remained a record in English cricket until 1994. Opinions were divided over his captaincy. He was a deep thinker on the game and critics believed him to be tactically advanced, but his pessimism, clashes with the selectors and inability to get the best out of his players led most commentators to rate him a poor leader. After attending public school, MacLaren played intermittently for Lancashire until 1899 as he tried to establish a career outside the sport. Even so, he was appointed county captain in 1894 and was chosen frequently to play for England. An appointment as Lancashire's assistant secretary allowed him to play more regularly from 1900. He first captained England in 1898 as a stand-in, but became captain in his own right in 1899. Under his leadership, England lost to Australia in three consecutive series—1899, 1901–02 and 1902. MacLaren was involved in controversies throughout all three defeats, and was replaced as captain in 1905, although he remained in the team. Business interests kept him out of the game for the following years, but he was invited to lead England once more in 1909. Defeat in that series ended his Test career, and the following year he ceased playing regular first-class cricket. He played occasionally until 1922–23, and had some late successes: in 1921, a team selected and captained by MacLaren defeated a previously unbeaten Australian team, and on his final first-class appearance during a 1922–23 Marylebone Cricket Club tour of New Zealand, he scored 200 runs. MacLaren had many jobs as he attempted to find ways to support his cricket, family and lifestyle. At various times, he worked as a teacher, a journalist and a cricket coach. For many years, he was employed as Lancashire's assistant secretary but such were his financial worries that he often had to ask for cash advances from the committee, with which he had a stormy relationship. He worked for several years as private secretary to K. S. Ranjitsinhji and he became involved in his employer's financial scandals. Many of MacLaren's later business ventures were failures, and only when his wife came into an inheritance did he and his family live in comfort. Throughout his life, MacLaren was involved in many disagreements and was never popular with teammates. However, he was a hero to the cricket writer Neville Cardus, who wrote prolifically on him. MacLaren died in 1944, aged 72. Early life MacLaren was born on 1 December 1871 in Whalley Range, a fairly prosperous district of Manchester,Down (1981), p. 9. the second of seven sons to James MacLaren and Emily Carver. His father, a cotton merchant and cricket enthusiast, served as honorary treasurer to the Lancashire team from 1881 until his death in 1900. MacLaren senior encouraged his sons to play cricket. With the aim of improving their ability in the game, MacLaren senior sent Archie and his older brother James to Elstree, a school well-regarded for its coaching.Down (1981), pp. 9–12. MacLaren's cricket instruction was supplemented during the holidays at Old Trafford Cricket Ground, where his father paid professional cricketers to bowl at him. He was soon selected for the school's cricket team, scored his first century, and was the captain by his final year. From Elstree, MacLaren went to Harrow School in 1886 where he joined James; Geoffrey, their younger brother, followed them but financial difficulties prevented any other family members attending the school. MacLaren had little success in intra-school cricket during his first year there but in 1887, success in trial games resulted in his promotion to the school first eleven. A century in an early match ensured his selection for the important fixture against Eton College at Lord's. Although an inexperienced Harrow team was easily defeated, MacLaren top-scored in both innings with scores of 55 and 67, and in praising his batting, critics suggested he had a bright future. He came top of the school batting averages for the 1887 season. Wet weather in the following two years affected playing conditions, making the cricket pitches slow-paced and difficult to bat on. With little experience of such conditions, MacLaren had a succession of failures. His technique, based at the time on playing forward at the ball, was unsuited to wet pitches and it was only late in 1889 that he made the required technical adjustments and learned to play off the back foot (i.e. stepping backwards to play a shot). During 1890, his final year at Harrow, he captained the team and had his most successful season, scoring over 500 runs at an average of 42.54. In the match against Eton at Lord's, MacLaren once more succeeded when others struggled, and he scored 76 on a difficult pitch. In his four years at Harrow, MacLaren was twice awarded the prize for the school's best batsman, and received awards for his fielding. MacLaren also played football successfully: he captained his House team and played in the school first eleven in 1888 and 1889 before a knee injury forced him to miss the 1890 season.Down (1981), pp. 12–14. Unlike many of his fellow amateur cricketers in this period, MacLaren did not attend Oxford or Cambridge Universities, where he would have played a high level of cricket; his father could not afford to send him or his brothers there. On leaving Harrow, MacLaren found employment with the Manchester and Liverpool District Bank.Down (1981), pp. 15–16. Lancashire cricketer Lancashire monitored MacLaren's progress during his time at Harrow.Down (1981), p. 13. When his season there ended in 1890, he was selected to play for Lancashire in the County Championship. Making his first-class debut on 14 August 1890 in a match against Sussex, he scored 108 runs on a difficult pitch in a relatively fast time of two hours. Although less successful in the remaining games of the season, he finished fourth in the Lancashire averages with 140 runs at an average of 23.33.Down (1981), p. 15. MacLaren's financial circumstances forced him to keep working at the District Bank, limiting the amount of cricket he played in 1891 and 1892.Down (1981), p. 16. When he did play for Lancashire, MacLaren was moderately successful. He led the county's batting averages in 1892 and in total scored 548 runs at 27.40. Of his two centuries, the second came when he opened the batting.Down (1981), pp. 16–17. During the winter of 1892–93, MacLaren studied cotton manufacture in New Orleans; when he returned home, he played more regularly for Lancashire. He scored consistently in 1893, totalling 831 runs at 25.18, had success in the high-profile match against Yorkshire, and led the team in the absence of the regular captain.Down (1981), p. 17. As a result of his successes, he was selected to play for the North of England in a representative match against the Australian team who were touring England that year. He scored 66, sharing an opening partnership of 121 in 80 minutes with his county colleague Albert Ward. Later in the season, he was chosen to play for the amateur \\"Gentlemen\\" team in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's.Down (1981), pp. 17–18. Before the 1894 season, MacLaren resigned from the bank to play a whole season of cricket.Down (1981), p. 18. Lancashire at the time were undergoing a period of transition, and the captaincy was unsettled: three men captained the county in the first part of the season. In the absence of other amateurs with county experience who could play regularly, MacLaren was appointed captain.Down (1981), p. 19. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack observed that MacLaren was young for the position, and largely unproven in cricket, but it supported the decision.Wynne-Thomas, p. 59. After losing his first match in charge, the team improved in the latter part of the season to finish fourth in the Championship. MacLaren finished sixth in the Lancashire averages, and in total scored 1,105 runs at 25.69, but his batting had made little progress since his debut. However, his successful leadership of Lancashire led some press critics to suggest him as a future England captain. At the end of the season, he was a last-minute selection to tour Australia with a team led by Andrew Stoddart.Down (1981), p. 20. Test cricketer=Test debut Stoddart's team which toured Australia in 1894–95: MacLaren is at the bottom left Approached to organise a touring team by the Australian cricket authorities, Stoddart had been unable to persuade several leading batsmen to join his squad.Frith, p. 14. Stoddart only took 13 men, of whom two were wicket-keepers (only one of whom could realistically play in each match) and one was a lob bowler who did not play any Test matches; this guaranteed MacLaren's selection for all the matches against Australia. Consequently, he retained his place even when his form was poor. In his first game, against South Australia, he scored 228,Down (1981), p. 21. and hit another half-century in the build-up to the first Test. He made his international debut on 14 December 1894, scoring 4 and 20 as England won despite being asked to follow on.Down (1981), pp. 22–23. England also won the next game, although MacLaren was caught from the opening delivery of the match, the first time anyone had been dismissed by the first ball of a Test.Down (1981), p. 24. Australia took the third and fourth Tests to level the series. MacLaren had little personal success, and averaged only 12.50 in the series after four games. By then, MacLaren was in financial difficulties. As an amateur, his expenses were covered by the tour organisers but he received no money for playing. To support him financially, the Lancashire committee had given him £100 before the tour. By the latter stages of the tour, his money was running out; most of it was probably spent betting on horse races, and he sent Lancashire a request for further money. Just before the final Test, he received a £60 advance on his expenses for the upcoming English season. For the fifth Test, he dropped down from opening the batting, which he had done throughout the series, to batting at number five,Down (1981), pp. 24–26. and responded with his first Test century. Batting with greater caution than usual, he scored 120 before accidentally standing on his own wicket.Down (1981), pp. 26–27. England won the match to take the series 3–2, amid great public interest in England and Australia.Frith, pp. 158–59, 196. MacLaren scored 240 runs at 26.67 in the Test series, finishing fourth in the English averages.Frith, p. 184. He performed more effectively in the lesser matches,Gibson, p. 63. and following some final tour fixtures, he totalled 803 runs at 47.23 in all first-class games. On the six-week outward journey MacLaren met (Kathleen) Maud Power, an Australian socialite and the daughter of a horse racing official. They were married in 1898.Frith, pp. 33–37. World record holder MacLaren returned home via Japan, missing the start of the 1895 cricket season. In his absence, he was named as a \\"Young Batsman of the Year\\" in Wisden for his performances in 1894. After playing two games for Lancashire, MacLaren accepted the offer of a teaching job in a preparatory school in Harrow; although still Lancashire's captain, he missed several matches, to the disquiet of its supporters. The team's results were mixed in his absence, and he returned to play Somerset at Taunton.Down (1981), p. 29. On the first day of the three-day game, MacLaren scored 289 not out in 330 minutes. On the second day, he took his score to 424 before he was dismissed, surpassing the previous highest individual innings in first-class cricket,Down (1981), pp. 30–33. W. G. Grace's score of 344, made in 1876. MacLaren batted for 470 minutes in total and hit 62 fours and a six.Gibson, p. 84. This remained the highest score in first-class cricket until 1923 when Bill Ponsford scored 429 in Australia, and was the largest first-class innings in England until Brian Lara scored 501 in 1994. In total, Lancashire scored 801 runs and won the game by an innings. After a spell of lower scores, MacLaren played several big innings, including three consecutive centuries in the last three games of the season.Wynne-Thomas, p. 62. He ended 1895 top of the national batting averages with 1,229 runs at 51.20.Down (1981), p. 37. MacLaren was elected a life member of Lancashire in recognition of his achievements.Down (1981), p. 38. Teaching commitments left MacLaren unavailable for the start of the 1896 season, and his first appearance came in July.Down (1981), p. 39. Although he had batted only once in the season, he was chosen to play in the second Test match of the summer between England and Australia, a selection made controversial by his lack of cricket. As the Test was played at Old Trafford, the England team was chosen by the Lancashire committee, who recognised that MacLaren would attract spectators as a local player. He was dismissed by the first ball he faced in the first innings, and scored 15 runs in the second as England were defeated.Down (1981), p. 40. Shortly after the Test, he scored 226 against Kent to take Lancashire to a draw in a match they seemed likely to lose.Down (1981), p. 41. This was enough for him to retain his place in the team for the final Test match, where he scored 20 and 6.Down (1981), pp. 41–42. He batted effectively for the rest of the season, finishing with 713 runs for Lancashire at 54.85. Critics praised his batting, but his absences may have prevented the team from winning the Championship; they finished second.Down (1981), p. 43. In all first-class matches, he scored 922 runs at 36.88. Second tour of Australia MacLaren's teaching duties meant that in 1897 he again missed the start of the cricket season, and he felt it necessary to resign as Lancashire's captain. When he began playing, he scored heavily, including another double century against Kent, and his runs helped Lancashire to win the County Championship:Down (1981), p. 45. concentrating on aggressive batting, he scored faster than in previous years, and hit 974 runs at 51.26.Wynne-Thomas, pp. 67–68. At the end of the season, MacLaren was included in Stoddart's second Australian touring team. Despite high expectations of success, the Test series was lost 4–1. Although nominally captain, Stoddart played in only two Tests; he was grief-stricken after the death of his mother and disillusioned by the failures of his team.Gibson, pp. 69–70. MacLaren, after an unproductive start to the tour, scored 142 and 100 against New South Wales to become the first batsman to score two centuries in the same Australian first-class match.Down (1981), p. 47. In the absence of Stoddart, he captained the England team in the first Test.Down (1981), pp. 47–48. He scored 109 in the first innings, batting more cautiously than usual, and 50 not out in the second as England won by nine wickets.Down (1981), pp. 48–49. His captaincy proved controversial when he refused to recall the Australian batsman Charlie McLeod to the wickets after he was dismissed; McLeod was out to a no-ball but, being deaf, did not hear the umpire's call and was run out when he left his crease.Gibson, p. 70. With Stoddart still absent, MacLaren was captain in the second Test. Australia won by an innings, and MacLaren was criticised in the Australian press for complaining about the pitch.Down (1981), p. 49. Commentators also suggested that he underused the bowling of Ted Wainwright.Down (1981), p. 50. Stoddart returned for the third and fourth Tests, both of which England lost by an innings. MacLaren scored 124 in the third game, but was mocked in the press after the fourth when he claimed that a fly in his eye caused him to be dismissed. When Stoddart withdrew from the final match, MacLaren once more assumed the leadership. He scored 65 in the first innings but could not prevent Australia winning again.Down (1981), p. 51. In all first-class matches, MacLaren scored 1,037 runs at 54.57; in the Test matches, he aggregated 488 runs at an average of 54.22. Wisden noted that MacLaren batted \\"magnificently\\" and commented: \\"Of all the English players the one who had the best cause to look back upon the trip with satisfaction was MacLaren.\\" At the conclusion of the tour, on 17 March 1898, he married Power. The wedding attracted media attention and was well attended.Down (1981), p. 52. The couple later had two sons. England captain=Appointment and start of captaincy MacLaren played little cricket in 1898, initially owing to his teaching commitments and the need to establish himself and his wife in a new home. After making his first appearance in July, he did not play again until August. He played nine first-class games, scoring 478 runs at 29.87, before his season was ended by neuralgia.Down (1981), pp. 53–54. Despite his frequent absences—again he missed the first part of the season—Lancashire re- appointed MacLaren as joint captain for 1899.Down (1981), p. 54. That summer, the Australians toured England and the first Test took place before MacLaren had played any cricket. For the second game, MacLaren replaced W. G. Grace as England captain; the other candidate for the leadership was Stanley Jackson, who was senior to MacLaren at Harrow and had preceded him into the England side, but MacLaren was favoured owing to his previous experience in the role with Lancashire and England.Gibson, p. 48. Australia comfortably won the second Test, and on his first appearance of the season, MacLaren scored 4 runs opening the innings on the first day. In the second innings, he moved down the order to number six, but he came in to bat when England trailed heavily and had lost four wickets. He batted for around 150 minutes to score 88 not out.Down (1981), pp. 56–57. The Wisden match report stated: \\"There was ... some risk in playing MacLaren, who had not so far taken part in any first- class cricket during the season. In this case however, the [selection] committee had reason to congratulate themselves, MacLaren playing a magnificent second innings and making a great, though fruitless, effort to save the game ... Never has MacLaren played a greater innings.\\" Afterwards, MacLaren scored a century in difficult batting conditions against Yorkshire.Down (1981), p. 57. Jackson did not play in this game, and initially refused to play for England in the third Test; the press attributed this to jealousy of MacLaren and anger at being passed over for the captaincy. The third Test was drawn owing to poor weather, but England's revival continued in the next game, which was drawn with England in a dominant position. The final match was also drawn, but while England lost the series 1–0, critics believed the team had recovered from a poor start to the summer and held the ascendancy in the final three games.Down (1981), pp. 57–60. MacLaren's only score over fifty was that in the second Test, and he finished the series with 164 runs at 32.80. In all first-class cricket, he made 814 runs at 32.56, including two centuries against Yorkshire.Down (1981), pp. 57, 59. Full-time cricketer In late 1899, MacLaren joined a private cricket tour of America and Canada organised by the cricket-playing Indian prince Ranjitsinhji.Down (1981), pp. 61–62. The following March, he was appointed as an assistant secretary at Lancashire. The position was a sinecure;Wynne-Thomas, p. 74. his main role was to coach the first eleven which effectively meant that he was paid to play cricket, despite his amateur status. Surviving records do not indicate his salary, but some sources suggest he was paid comfortably more than Lancashire's leading professionals.Down (1981), pp. 63–64.McKinstry, p. 72. In addition, MacLaren worked as a journalist for the Daily Express, reporting on matches in which he played, a common practice at the time for amateurs.Down (1981), p. 64. Resuming sole control over the Lancashire side, and freed from his teaching responsibilities, MacLaren played from the beginning of the 1900 season, planning meticulously in a bid to lead Lancashire to the County Championship. His batting form suffered initially, but the team dominated the start of the season. Commentators gave much of the credit to MacLaren's captaincy. However, he was severely criticised for conservative tactics in one game, when he was reluctant to attempt to force a win. In the latter stages of the season, MacLaren scored prolifically, making a succession of high scores at rapid pace.Down (1981), pp. 64–66. He ended the 1900 season with 1,554 runs at 36.13. During that season, the leading Lancashire bowler Arthur Mold had been no-balled for throwing, but MacLaren defended him in the press. At a meeting of county captains in December, MacLaren was the only representative to defend the legality of Mold's bowling action, and in 1901, Mold was again no-balled and his career was effectively over. MacLaren struggled with injury in 1901, and his batting form suffered. He frequently dropped low in the batting order, and it was late in the season before he began to score runs regularly. His captaincy was criticised after some tactical decisions which were either unconventional or unsuccessful, and he clashed with the Lancashire committee over the poor state of Old Trafford's pitch.Down (1981), pp. 66–68. In total, he scored 1,069 first-class runs at 31.44. MacLaren c. 1905 MacLaren was invited by the Melbourne Cricket Club to bring a team to Australia during the English winter of 1901–02. This was the last privately organised team to represent England at Test level in Australia, with subsequent ones playing under the colours of the MCC. Many leading players were unavailable—Yorkshire's Wilfred Rhodes and George Hirst were not permitted to tour by their captain Lord Hawke.Down (1981), pp. 68–69. The team was judged to be weak, but contained several players at the beginning of their careers who went on to success at Test level. Sydney Barnes was chosen by MacLaren after playing only a handful of county matches. Barnes' success on his single appearance for Lancashire in 1901 convinced MacLaren of his worth, to the surprise and disparagement of commentators, most of whom had never seen him.Down (1981), p. 70. Barnes began the tour well, but did not get on with his captain. During a storm on part of the sea journey, MacLaren, speculating on their chances of survival, commented to a team member: \\"If we go down, at least that bugger Barnes will go down with us.\\" The team lost their first match and continued to struggle. MacLaren clashed with authorities in Melbourne over his right to choose an umpire, but he began to bat well at Sydney, where he scored 145 and 73 in a tour match.Down (1981), pp. 71–72. In the first Test, MacLaren shared a century opening partnership with Tom Hayward and scored 116 to become the first man to score four Test centuries. This was the last Test century by an England captain in Australia for 57 years. Barnes bowled with great success; Colin Blythe and Len Braund, like Barnes chosen by MacLaren and making their Test debuts, performed effectively and England won by an innings.Down (1981), pp. 73–74. The remaining four Tests were lost as the team suffered from a lack of effective bowlers. MacLaren severely overbowled Barnes, who took 13 wickets, in the second Test; the bowler was injured in the next game and took no further part on the tour.Down (1981), pp. 74–76. MacLaren was successful with the bat. He scored 92 in the fourth Test, made centuries in the two first-class games played in between the Test matches, and finished top of the batting averages. Critics judged that his team had performed well despite the heavy defeat, and his captaincy attracted praise.Down (1981), pp. 77–79. In addition, the team were considered to be the best fielding side to visit Australia. In the Test series, MacLaren scored 412 runs at 45.77, while in all first-class matches he hit 929 runs at 58.06. Before the tour began, MacLaren resigned as Lancashire's captain and assistant secretary, owing to his concern for the health of his wife. Journalists speculated that MacLaren would join the Hampshire team as assistant secretary, as he lived in that county, or even move to Australia. Lancashire selected a replacement captain, but when MacLaren returned to England, he re-committed to the club, stating the visit to Australia had improved the health of his wife, and he was reappointed.Down (1981), pp. 79–81.Wynne-Thomas, pp. 80–81. Ashes series of 1902 MacLaren began the 1902 season well and, facing an Ashes series against Australia, began planning for the Tests; he arranged to receive reports on prospective players from both sides.Down (1981), p. 83. England dominated the first Test, scoring 376 and bowling Australia out for 36; rain prevented a result and also heavily curtailed the drawn second Test.Down (1981), pp. 83–84. The team for the third Test, played in Sheffield, was to be chosen from 12 players picked by the selectors, with the final place contested between Bill Lockwood and Schofield Haigh. However, on the morning of the match, MacLaren, with the approval of the selector Lord Hawke, summoned Barnes from Manchester to play instead of either. The move was unpopular with spectators—their favoured choice, Haigh, was a Yorkshire player—but Barnes took six wickets in the first innings,Down (1981), pp. 84–85. although injury reduced his effectiveness in the second innings. England were bowled out in poor light—MacLaren's biographer Michael Down suggests that part of the blame lies with him for not appealing against the light—and needed an unlikely 339 runs to win in their second innings. MacLaren changed the batting order, asking Gilbert Jessop to open the batting. Jessop scored fifty, and MacLaren scored 63, but England lost by 143 runs.Down (1981), pp. 85–86. Following the defeat, the England selectors made several changes for the fourth Test; both Barnes and Jessop were left out. MacLaren favoured Jessop's inclusion but the selectors considered him unreliable.Down (1981), p. 87. Although Barnes was not fully fit, later commentators suggested the selectors omitted him because of MacLaren's actions at Sheffield. A further player was added to the squad in case the pitch was affected by rain before the match, but rather than choosing Haigh, the leading wet-pitch bowler in the country,Down (1981), p. 88. Hawke insisted that Sussex's Fred Tate was included—critics have suggested that Hawke wanted to prevent Haigh's absence from the Yorkshire team, of which Hawke was captain, given the unlikeliness of the extra bowler being needed. According to the cricket writer Neville Cardus, when MacLaren saw the list of players in the team, he responded: \\"My God, look what they've sent me\\". MacLaren was angry with Hawke, and when it rained before the match, included Tate in the final eleven at the expense of George Hirst, a leading all- rounder.Gibson, p. 87. Gibson suggests that Tate was included by the selectors only \\"because they thought MacLaren could not possibly pick him\\" and so he could not make any further late changes to the team; MacLaren, according to Gibson, in turn included Tate out of spite. Other writers have suggested that MacLaren, as a Lancastrian, preferred a Sussex player to a Yorkshire one.Whimpress and Hart, p. 51. Australia won the toss. The match began in damp conditions, and before the pitch began to dry, at which point it would become extremely difficult for batting, the Australian opening batsmen scored 135 in 90 minutes; Australia's total reached 173 for one wicket at lunch, and Victor Trumper scored a century in that time. MacLaren was subsequently criticised for allowing Australia to score so quickly, but claimed that his carefully planned strategy was rendered obsolete when Trumper began to strike the ball out of the ground. MacLaren commented: \\"I couldn't very well have had a man fielding in the bloody practice ground, now could I?\\"Down (1981), pp. 88–89. The bowlers recovered the situation to some extent, and following a century from Jackson, England trailed by 37 runs after the first innings. In the second innings, Australia collapsed to the England bowlers, but Tate dropped a crucial catch while stationed by MacLaren at the edge of the field. MacLaren also received criticism for this, as Tate was unaccustomed to fielding on the boundary.Down (1981), pp. 89–90. Gibson notes that MacLaren \\"later spent much breath defending himself on this point\\"; although it is not clear how Tate came to be moved—a later interpretation is that MacLaren moved Tate there rather than ask an amateur player to cross the field for a few deliveries—most commentators agree that this was the turning point of the match.Whimpress and Hart, p. 62. England were left needing 124 runs to win. MacLaren opened the batting, having batted at number four in the first innings, and tried to score quickly, but was caught from a big hit. According to Gibson, he returned to the dressing room in fury, throwing his bat across the room and saying that he had \\"thrown away the match and the bloody rubber [series]\\".Gibson, p. 88. Gibson suggests that the implication that only MacLaren could have guided England to victory must have had a demoralising effect on the remaining batsmen, and speculates that he felt guilty over the composition of a team that looked likely to lose. Gibson comments: \\"This does not say much for MacLaren as a captain. Indeed, it has always seemed to me a shocking performance, from the choice of the team to the chuck of the bat.\\" Wickets continued to fall and Tate, the last batsman, was bowled when England needed four runs to win.Down (1981), p. 91. England won the final match by one wicket,Down (1981), p. 92. but lost the series 2–1. While contemporary critics did not blame MacLaren, the cricket authorities were less happy. MacLaren believed that the choices of the selectors had made it impossible to win, and continued to write about the series for many years.Down (1981), pp. 92–93. He finished the series with 198 runs at 28.28, and ended the season with 1,254 first-class runs at 32.15. Cricketing decline=Replacement as England captain MacLaren on a postcard c. 1905 MacLaren took a new job with a wine merchant which allowed him to complete a full season in 1903. Wet weather caused many difficult pitches for batting, and MacLaren was often the only Lancashire batsman able to cope with the conditions.Down (1981), pp. 95, 100. His highest-profile success came when he captained the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's. When his team faced defeat on the final day on a difficult pitch, he scored 168 not out and shared a partnership of 309 with C. B. Fry in less than three hours. This innings was later praised as one of his finest.Down (1981), pp. 99–100. He ended the season with 1,886 runs at 42.86, and Lancashire finished fourth.Down (1981), p. 101. However, his success with the bat was overshadowed by controversy over the England captaincy. MacLaren originally planned to tour Australia with another private team in the winter of 1903–04, but withdrew over his concerns that there was not enough strong bowling available. Frustrated with MacLaren, the cricket authorities in Melbourne asked the MCC, via Pelham Warner, to organise their own team. MacLaren was not offered the captaincy—Warner was chosen in June 1903 when Jackson proved unavailable. Newspaper rumours suggested that Lord Hawke played a part in this decision, and that MacLaren's recent paid role for Lancashire counted against him.Down (1981), pp. 95– 96. The press favoured MacLaren, and Warner was widely criticised; one journal noted that he was \\"condemned as an interloper and a nonentity\\".Down (1981), pp. 97–98. The cricket establishment was less sympathetic to MacLaren. After publicly vacillating over the summer, he eventually decided not to tour under Warner, whom he perceived to be his junior. The tour proved a great success for Warner, and his team won the Test series.Down (1981), p. 99. In 1904, MacLaren led Lancashire to victory in the County Championship, their only such success under his captaincy. Unusually for a Championship-winning team, the club relied heavily on batting rather than bowling. MacLaren played several big innings, scoring at a rapid pace, as his team began the season with a string of victories. Their form faded later in the season, but they remained unbeaten.Down (1981), pp. 102–05. In all first-class cricket, MacLaren scored 1,191 runs at 31.34. At some point during the season, he was asked by Ranjitsinhji, a close friend, to become his private secretary, and both men travelled to India during the winter of 1904–05. Ranjitsinhji at the time was pursuing his claim to the throne of Nawanagar, and he remained in India when MacLaren returned to England for the 1905 cricket season.Wilde, pp. 164–66. The Australians toured England in 1905, but MacLaren was again passed over for the England captaincy; the team was captained by Jackson and won the series 2–0.Down (1981), pp. 106–07. MacLaren began the season well and played in the first Test. Australia led by 25 runs after the first innings, as England struggled to play the pace of Albert Cotter. According to a story later told by Neville Cardus, before the second innings he saw MacLaren muttering: \\"Cotter! I'll bloody Cotter him!\\".Down (1981), p. 107. MacLaren attacked Cotter's bowling, and overcame the defensive bowling tactics used by Australia to slow down the game. He scored 140, his highest Test innings and only Test century in England. When Australia batted, Bernard Bosanquet took eight wickets to bowl England to a win; it was MacLaren's suggestion that Jackson persist with Bosanquet's bowling when it was initially unsuccessful.Down (1981), pp. 107–08. MacLaren scored 56 and 79 in the drawn second Test, but did not play in the third owing to injury. He played in the final two Tests but accomplished little.Down (1981), p. 109. In the series, he scored 303 runs at 43.28. Jackson later wrote that MacLaren was an invaluable tactical aid during the series. Lancashire ended the season second in the Championship, and opened a testimonial fund for MacLaren which raised over £800 by the end of the season. He later clashed with committee members who were unhappy with his decision to use the money to buy a motor car. At the end of the season, MacLaren resigned the captaincy of Lancashire, but was persuaded to continue by the committee.Down (1981), pp. 110–12. In total during 1905, he scored 1,522 runs at an average of 35.39 in all first- class cricket. Private secretary to Ranjitsinhji A combination of injuries and work reduced the amount of cricket MacLaren played after 1905.Down (1981), p. 112. He missed most of Lancashire's matches in June and July 1906. He returned against Middlesex at Lord's in August, but was involved in mild controversy when he declined to put Middlesex's batsmen under pressure when chasing a small but challenging total to win the game; this may have arisen from his dislike of Lord's and the figures in authority there.Down (1981), pp. 113–14. MacLaren ended the 1906 season with 599 runs at 20.65. In the winter of 1906–07, MacLaren returned to India to work for Ranjitsinhji. In January 1907, he wrote to Lancashire to inform them of his reduced availability for 1907; even so, the committee retained him as captain.Down (1981), p. 114. In February, Ranjitsinhji was named as the new ruler of Nawanagar.Wilde, p. 172. MacLaren attended his installation on 11 March—MacLaren and the politician Arthur Priestley were the only English attendeesWilde, pp. 173, 176.—and did not return to England until mid-June, although he informed Lancashire that his absence in India was to recover from an illness. He resumed the captaincy of Lancashire, and made a good start with scores of 47 and 92 in his second match, but his form faded. One match provoked a public row between MacLaren and Lord's. MacLaren captained Lancashire against Middlesex at Lord's in July; rain restricted play on the first day of the three-day game, and at the start of the second day, the umpires ruled that the waterlogged pitch remained unfit to play on. Some spectators came on to the pitch to look for themselves, then protested outside the pavilion. The incident was defused by the ground authorities, but the following day MacLaren told the press: \\"Owing to the pitch having been deliberately torn up by the public, I, as captain of the Lancashire eleven, cannot see my way to continue the game, the groundsman bearing me out that the wicket [pitch] could not be again put right.\\"Down (1981), p. 115. Lancashire would not play—although all decisions about fitness for play should have been made by the umpires, not MacLaren—and the match was drawn. The incident provoked discussion in the press, but most critics agreed that MacLaren was in the wrong. MacLaren subsequently scored his first century for two years, but he did little in the remainder of the season, at the end of which he again resigned the captaincy of Lancashire, conscious of his failing form and fitness.Down (1981), p. 116. In all first-class cricket in 1907, he scored 829 runs at 26.74. Much of MacLaren's time was now taken up working for Ranjitsinhji, who visited England between October 1907 and December 1908.Wilde, pp. 179, 205. MacLaren played just nine matches in 1908; Lancashire were eager for him to play, but he had little impact. His greatest success came for the Gentlemen against the Players at the Oval, when he shared a partnership of 141 with C. B. Fry. In total, he scored 428 runs at an average of 28.53.Down (1981), pp. 116–17. Meanwhile, Ranjitsinhji lived extravagantly in Sussex, running up huge bills and ignoring most attempts to make him pay.Wilde, pp. 180–81. MacLaren was involved in several cases which resulted in either legal action or complaint to the India Office.Wilde, pp. 163–64, 183–91. When an artist had to go to court to make Ranjitsinhji pay for work she had done, MacLaren's attempts to delay and obstruct her caused the India Office, in its adjudication, to describe him as Ranjitsinhji's \\"ridiculous private secretary\\".Wilde, pp. 196–201. In October, MacLaren was taken to court himself over non-payment of rent. He had a house close to Ranjitsinhji's residence, and claimed in court that Ranjitsinhji rented the house on his behalf, and, as a ruling prince, could not be prosecuted. The magistrates disagreed, ruled MacLaren liable, and forced him to pay—although Ranjitsinhji probably paid for him.Wilde, pp. 198–99. In his biography of Ranjitsinhji, Simon Wilde suggests that MacLaren had to work very hard for his employer in this period, and found little time for cricket. In addition, his batting form was poor throughout, and he seemed to be in bad physical condition when he occasionally found time to play. Before Ranjitsinhji returned to India, MacLaren resigned as his secretary—although he went with him to India for a holiday. According to Wilde, the resignation was to allow MacLaren to play more regularly, but \\"he never really recovered his form\\".Wilde, pp. 206–07. In summarising Ranjitsinhji's life at this time, Wilde suggests that his unreliability with money was quite calculated, and writes: \\"Many of his off-the-field exploits with A. C. MacLaren ... will probably never be known, but it seems clear that sometimes they were not averse to conducting themselves in the fashion of E. W. Hornung's fictional character Raffles, the cricketing burglar.\\"Wilde, pp. xi–xii. Return as England captain For the 1909 season, MacLaren worked to improve his fitness prior to that summer's Test series against Australia. Jackson was first choice to lead the England team, but when he was unavailable, MacLaren was appointed captain, to the approval of critics and the public.Down (1981), pp. 117–18. MacLaren began the season well for Lancashire, and as Australia struggled in their early tour matches, England began the Tests as favourites to win.Down (1981), p. 118. England won the low-scoring first match; the press praised MacLaren's deployment of fielders. In England's second innings Jack Hobbs, batting with Fry—whom MacLaren promoted to open the batting having done so himself in the first innings—scored the required runs to complete a ten-wicket win. Hobbs was making his first Test appearance in England, despite MacLaren's reluctance to include him in the team.Down (1981), p. 119. The England selectors made several changes to the team for the second Test. Colin Blythe, a crucial bowler to the team, withdrew before the game. Other players were left out whom most commentators believed should have played, and the bowling attack was packed with medium-paced bowlers of a similar style.Down (1981), pp. 119–20. The report in Wisden suggested: \\"Never in the history of Test Matches in England has there been such blundering in the selection of an England eleven\\". The selectors later implied the controversial choices were at the behest of MacLaren, although other evidence suggests that MacLaren did not get the team he requested.Down (1981), p. 120. England lost the game; MacLaren's reputation suffered and commentators began to blame him for the defeat. He offered his resignation, but the selectors retained him as captain and restored some of the players omitted from the second Test.Down (1981), p. 121. When England lost the third Test after the batsmen failed, not helped by MacLaren's poor form, critics questioned his place in the team.Down (1981), p. 122. MacLaren tried to excuse his position, suggesting in the press that he knew the team would struggle and played \\"in spite of my personal wishes\\". He also implied that the team's selection was out of his hands. When the fourth Test was rained off, England could not win the series and so Australia retained the Ashes. The final match of the series was drawn, mainly because the pitch heavily favoured batting. MacLaren was involved in another selection controversy when the fast bowler Claude Buckenham was left out of the England team at his instigation. The Wisden match report described this decision as \\"so grave a blunder that it is difficult to find words in which to speak of it.\\" The Wisden editor, Sydney Pardon, commented: \\"A fatal blunder was committed in leaving out Buckenham—a blunder for which it was generally understood that MacLaren was responsible. Experts occasionally do strange things and this was one of the strangest. The idea of letting England go into the field in fine weather, on a typical Oval wicket, with no fast bowler except Sharp touched the confines of lunacy.\\" Further issues arose over MacLaren's handling of his bowlers, and Wisden suggested \\"MacLaren was sadly at fault in his management of the England bowling\\". Douglas Carr, a 37-year- old, was called into the team after some success in preceding games and on the premise that the Australians would be unable to play his googly. After Carr had initial success, MacLaren kept him bowling for a long period until the player tired and was easily punished by the batsmen.Down (1981), p. 123. In his only innings, MacLaren scored 12, and when the match ended, much of the blame for England's failures was apportioned to him.Down (1981), p. 124. In the series, he scored 85 runs at 12.14. The Oval match was his final Test match; in 35 games he had scored 1,931 runs at 33.87. He ended the season with 613 runs at 19.77. Retirement from regular cricket MacLaren played regularly for Lancashire at the start of 1910, but his poor form continued until midway through the season, when he scored centuries in successive matches. He played once more for Lancashire and once for the \\"Gentlemen of England\\" before withdrawing from first-class cricket for the season,Down (1981), pp. 124–25. in which he scored 345 runs at 26.53. This was effectively the end of his Lancashire career and he played only sporadically for the team afterwards. He continued to play cricket, including a tour of Argentina with the MCC in 1910–11. He also played for the team of the businessman Lionel Robinson, including some first-class games, over the following seasons.Down (1981), p. 126. During the 1914 season, MacLaren attempted to return to the Lancashire team, possibly to boost the circulation of a magazine for which he was writing. He appeared in one county match, without success, although he continued to play in other first-class games for the MCC and other teams.Down (1981), pp. 126–27. Later career=Final cricket matches alt=A cricket team arranged in two rows. Most are wearing cricket whites and caps. After MacLaren stopped playing regularly for Lancashire, he formed a business partnership with J. N. Pentelow, a cricket writer. Pentelow was the owner of The World of Cricket, a cricket magazine, and in 1914 MacLaren joined him in an attempt to improve its circulation. MacLaren was officially known as the editor of the publication and Pentelow his assistant, but the latter did most of the work. Pentelow was already struggling to keep the magazine going, but matters worsened after MacLaren joined. Pentelow's debts increased and by the end of 1914, the business folded; although details are obscure, Down suggests that \\"MacLaren's characteristic unreliability with money left Pentelow very much in the lurch.\\" During the First World War, MacLaren joined the Royal Army Service Corps as a lieutenant and worked in the Manchester area recruiting men into the army. He was promoted to captain before leaving the Army on health grounds.Down (1981), p. 128. After the war, he was employed as cricket manager for Lionel Robinson and wrote for various newspapers and cricket publications. MacLaren and his family lived for a time on Robinson's estate when their financial situation was poor. He advised Robinson on the best way to prepare cricket pitches and to organise matches which might bring about Robinson's greater acceptance in society.Down (1981), p. 129. As part of this process, MacLaren arranged for the 1921 Australian touring team to play at Robinson's cricket ground against a team selected and captained by MacLaren himself.Down (1981), p. 129–30. The Australians struggled against MacLaren's team, but went on to dominate the Test matches against England; MacLaren insisted throughout the summer that the Australian team was not as strong as it appeared, and that younger English players should be chosen. Eastbourne Cricket Club invited him to captain a team named \\"An England XI\\" against the tourists following the conclusion of the Tests. He was dismissed by critics when he claimed that he could beat the Australian team; prior to the game, the Australians were undefeated on the tour and had won 22 of their 36 games.Down (1981), p. 133. MacLaren planned meticulously for the match; he chose an all-amateur team, selecting spin bowlers noted for their reliability and excellent fielders.Down (1981), p. 134. Although bowled out for 43 in their first innings, MacLaren's team came back strongly to win by 28 runs, the touring team's first defeat, although his batting contribution was slight.Down (1981), pp. 135–38. Coach and senior figure Lancashire appointed MacLaren as coach for the 1922 season, to popular acclaim; he also captained the Lancashire second team. Even before he began work, his poor financial situation forced him to request two advances on his salary.Down (1981), p. 140. As a coach, MacLaren was autocratic and demanding, but encouraged the players to think for themselves. He was unpopular with some players and clashed frequently with the Lancashire committee.Down (1981), pp. 141–44. During the winter of 1922–23, the MCC organised two cricket tours—a Test playing tour to South Africa and a tour to Australia and New Zealand intended to give experience to young, promising cricketers. MacLaren was chosen to captain the latter team on account of his experience and his success with young cricketers during his win over the Australians in 1921.Down (1981), pp. 145–46. He was given a good reception by the crowds when he played and press reports praised his tactical awareness. The team was undefeated in matches in New Zealand.Down (1981), pp. 150–51. Against the full New Zealand team, MacLaren scored 200 not out in 264 minutes in his final first-class innings; the effort placed a strain on his knee and he was unable to play again on the tour.Down (1981), pp. 153–54. He ended his first-class career with 22,236 runs at an average of 34.15. When the team returned to play more matches in Australia, MacLaren became involved in controversy for criticising the standards of play in New Zealand and for comments made in the press there. He also queried the first-class status of Bill Ponsford's record innings of 429, scored against Tasmania. On the journey home, MacLaren sent a message to Lancashire asking for more money; the committee declined to send the sum and shortly afterwards terminated his contract as coach. Lancashire told the press that MacLaren's knee injury meant that he could not continue.Down (1981), pp. 154–57. Final years In the following years, MacLaren and his family struggled financially. His wife's family sometimes sent money, but MacLaren often spent extravagantly whenever he had funds. On one occasion, when paid for writing an article, he moved out of his accommodation into an expensive hotel, and threw a dinner party for his friends. He ran up many debts—including an unpaid champagne bill at Old Trafford Cricket Ground in 1923—and borrowed money from friends. He supplemented his wife's income through working as a journalist and a coach. Among other business ventures, he designed a cricket bat, showed specially shot cricket films, briefly owned a hotel and attempted to start a horse bloodstock agency.Down (1981), pp. 157–61. He continued to play club cricket and in 1924–25 he managed a privately organised tour of South Africa.Down (1981), p. 162. Shortly before the Second World War, MacLaren's wife inherited a large sum of money which enabled them to live in comfort. They bought an estate at Warfield Park near Bracknell in BerkshireDown (1981), pp. 162–63. and the couple were able to live in the extravagant manner he had always wanted. Around this time, on a visit to America, MacLaren made a brief appearance in the Hollywood film The Four Feathers, which starred his friend, former cricketer C. Aubrey Smith.Down (1981), p. 163. In the 1940s, his health began to fail. He was hurt in a car crash and then contracted cancer. He died on 17 November 1944, aged 72; his wife died a few months later. Style, technique and captaincy MacLaren's obituary in The Times stated that he was \\"one of the outstanding opening batsmen of all time\\". As a batsman, he had a reputation for stylishness, but his technique was based on scoring runs safely.Down (1981), pp. 164–65. He always tried to seize the initiative in a game. Batting with his head slightly raised, he drew his bat back unusually far, which provided the power to his shots, and in particular his drives. He scored runs quickly, mainly through his ability to score from good length balls.Down (1981), p. 165. When playing a shot, he either stepped right forward or moved far back in the batting crease and having hit the ball, he followed through with the bat, often holding his pose for effect. These qualities, and his quick footwork, made him effective on difficult batting pitches.Down (1981), p. 166. One of his most highly regarded shots was the hook. In later years, Cardus described the shot: \\"To see MacLaren hook a fast ball ... from the front of his face, was in those days an experience which thrilled me like heroic poetry; he didn't merely hook the ball, he dismissed it from his presence.\\"Quoted in Down (1981), pp. 166–67. Cardus, for whom MacLaren was a boyhood hero, wrote prolifically about him in later years; he called one such essay on MacLaren \\"The Noblest Roman\\", and judged him among the best of all batsmen. Gideon Haigh suggests: \\"If ever a cricketer was the creation of a single writer, it is MacLaren, the luminous majesty with which he is associated owed in very large degree to his youthful acolyte Neville Cardus.\\" MacLaren was also a highly proficient fielder, initially in the outfield but later at slip.Down (1981), p. 167. Critics have looked less favourably on MacLaren as a captain.Gibson, p. 85. When he assumed the leadership of England, the press were reporting on the tactical performance of captains for the first time. MacLaren was among the first captains to study tactics.Down (1981), p. 168. However, judgements on his effectiveness have varied greatly. For most of his career, he was regarded as an excellent captain.Gibson, pp. 92–93. Contemporaries praised his tactical awareness; he planned minutely,Down (1981), pp. 170–71. and organised his fields extremely carefully to prevent batsmen scoring through blocking their favourite shots, a technique practically unheard of at the time.Down (1981), p. 172. He liked to alter the batting order, a tactic which often divides critics, although it frequently succeeded for MacLaren.Gibson, p. 86. He was less successful in managing his team. Regarded as a pessimist, he openly showed disappointment at the composition of his sides, and became downcast when the course of the match was running against him. Some of those who played under him thought that his sides were unhappy ones which operated without joy and solely concentrated on winning.Down (1981), pp. 173–74. He encountered many difficulties over selection; he often promoted cricketers whom he considered to show potential and consequently railed against committees which did not provide him with the players he wanted. Down suggests that MacLaren was usually correct, being more experienced and a better judge than most of those who chose the teams. Peter Wynne-Thomas describes MacLaren's approach to selection as \\"unorthodox\\", and writes that while his ideas were sometimes successful, they failed badly at other times.Wynne-Thomas, p. 54. Apart from his own failings, MacLaren had a reputation as an unlucky captain, both in terms of losing important players to injury and illness before vital games, and in the frequency with which he lost the toss before a match. Nor was MacLaren particularly popular; in later years, several people for whom he had been a hero changed their opinion once they met him. In his history of the club, Peter Wynne-Thomas describes MacLaren as the dominant figure in Lancashire cricket from his debut until the First World War.Wynne-Thomas, p. 53. Gibson accepts that MacLaren was tactically a good captain, but observes that in his 12 seasons as leader of a strong Lancashire team, he only once won the County Championship. In addition, as the appointed captain in four series against Australia, he was beaten in each one, something no other England captain has repeated. Gibson suggests that \\"the excuses begin to run thin, sieved through such a tale of failure.\\" Gibson summarises that \\"England under MacLaren must have been a good side to watch, save for the passionate partisans, but an uncomfortable side in which to play ... Bad captain or no, with no doubt ... MacLaren was one of the most entrancing, one of the most glamorous—though that word had not come into fashion in his day—characters of his cricketing epoch.\\"Gibson, p. 89.

It is underpinned by the basic science of pharmacology, with an added focus on the application of pharmacological principles and quantitative methods in the real human patient's population. It has a broad scope, from the discovery of new target molecules to the effects of drug usage in whole populations. Clinical pharmacologists usually have a rigorous medical and scientific training that enables them to evaluate evidence and produce new data through well-designed studies. Clinical pharmacologists must have access to enough outpatients for clinical care, teaching and education, and research as well as be supervised by medical specialists. Their responsibilities to patients include, but are not limited to, analyzing adverse drug effects, therapeutics, and toxicology including reproductive toxicology, cardiovascular risks, perioperative drug management and psychopharmacology. Clinical pharmacology also connects the gap between medical practice and laboratory science. The main objective is to promote the safety of prescription, maximize the drug effects and minimize the side effects. In this aspect, there can be an association with pharmacists skilled in areas of drug information, medication safety and other aspects of pharmacy practice related to clinical pharmacology. In fact, in countries such as USA, Netherlands, and France, pharmacists can be trained to become clinical pharmacists, to improve optimal drug therapy with clinical pharmacology related knowledge. In addition, the application of genetic, biochemical, or virotherapeutic techniques has led to a clear appreciation of the mechanisms involved in drug action. A bachelor's degree, in a clinical, health science or bioscience related field is typically required for enrollment on a master's degree level course in pharmacology. Institutions may also hold specific coursework and credit requirements for enrollment on advanced degrees in pharmacology. Branches Clinical Pharmacology consists of multiple branches listed below: *Pharmacodynamics - what drugs do to the body and how. This includes not just the cellular and molecular aspects, but also more relevant clinical measurements. For example, not just the biology of salbutamol, a beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist, but the peak flow rate of both healthy volunteers and real patients. *Pharmacokinetics - what happens to the drug while in the body. This involves the body systems for handling the drug, usually divided into the following classification: ** Absorption - the process of the drug moving into the bloodstream ** Distribution - the reversed transmission of the drug from one location to the other in the human body ** Metabolism - the process of how the drug is metabolized in the liver of the human body ** Excretion - the process of how the drug expels, happens in the liver and kidneys. *Rational Prescribing - using the right medication, at the right dose, using the right route and frequency of administration for the patient, and stopping the drug appropriately. *Adverse Drug Effects - determining the side effects of the medicine *Toxicology - deals with the negative effects on a living system caused by chemicals *Drug interactions - the study of how drugs interact with each other. Two drugs may negatively or positively affect the drug effects. *Drug development - usually culminating in some form of clinical trials and marketing authorization applications to country-specific drug regulators such as US FDA. *Molecular Pharmacology - studying drug action at the molecular level. This is also a branch of pharmacology in general, but the ultimate interest is in human as a system. *Pharmacogenomics - studying human genome to learn interaction of drugs with genetics, etc. Chatu, Sukhdev., and Christopher. Tofield. The Hands-on Guide to Clinical Pharmacology. 3rd ed., Wiley-Blackwell, 2010  History  Medicinal applications of plant and animal resources have been common since prehistoric times. Many countries have written documentation of their early traditional remedies of many types, like China, Egypt, and India. Some of these remedies are still identified as helpful in today's society, but most have them have been discarded due to the fact that they were useless and potentially harmful. During the 1500s, intermittent attempts were made to advance the methods of medicine. Schools were made to teach these advances, but none of these methods was effective and this led to the domination of thought that claimed to explain everything in regards to biology and disease with no experimentation to back it up. These schools would come up with strange methods that they believed were the answers to disease and injury. They thought that a wound could be healed if an ointment was applied to the weapon, and that disease was caused by having too much bile and blood in the human body. Around the 17th century, theoretical medicine was set aside and forgotten about, and people started to use medicine that was based on analysis and experimentation. Physicians began to apply these new methods to the traditional drugs and remedies that they had in their own culture. This is when the sciences of the preparation and use of medical drugs began to develop, although they still lacked methods to test some of the hypotheses they had about how drugs worked in the body.Paul G. Ambrose, Sujata M. Bhavnani, Christopher M. Rubino, Arnold Louie, Tawanda Gumbo, Alan Forrest, George L. Drusano; Pharmacokinetics-Pharmacodynamics of Antimicrobial Therapy: It's Not Just for Mice Anymore, Clinical Infectious Diseases, Volume 44, Issue 1, 1 January 2007, Pages 79–86, https://doi.org/10.1086/510079 By the late 18th century and early 19th century, the development of the methods of experimental physiology and pharmacology by François Magendie and his student Claude Bernard. From the late 18th century to the early 20th century, advances were made in chemistry and physiology that laid the foundation that was needed in order to understand drugs at the organ and tissue level. The advances that were made at this time gave manufacturers the ability to make and sell medicine that they claimed to be legitimate but were worthless. These claims were not able to be evaluated until the rational therapeutic concepts were reestablished in medicine about 60 years later. Around that same time, major development and growth in biology began. Information started to pile up on biological substrates and drug movements as soon as new techniques and concepts arose. During the last half-century, many new and some old drug groups were introduced. There has been even more rapid growth in even the last three decades, with understanding the bases of drug action at a molecular level. This new information has helped to identify the molecular mechanisms of many dugs and separate receptors and clone them. These methods aided in the many discoveries dealing with receptors. The expansion of scientific principles of pharmacology is still on-going today.

Here the inlet divides the riverside districts of Shad Thames and Jacob's Island. The River Neckinger is a reduced subterranean river that rises in Southwark and flows approximately 2.5 kilometres through that part of London to St Saviour's Dock where it enters the Thames. What remains of the river is enclosed and runs underground and most of its narrow catchment has been diverted into other combined and surface water sewers, flowing into the Southern Outfall Sewer and the Thames respectively. Course 19th century map showing the Lock Stream (between the Lock Hospital and Bull Inn) going under the Old Kent Road then reappearing as a channel on the other side. The watercourse drained first the seasonally wet (and occasionally flooded) ground at St George's Fields, now Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, in western Southwark. Its course was east as follows. It took the line of Brook Drive then passed by the Elephant and Castle, then passed the site of Lock Hospital, Kent Street. This upper section was also known before that hospital's closure in the early 19th century as the Lock Stream. It then passed the grounds of (since demolished) Bermondsey Abbey to the south, forming the channel north of what was the large Thames island of Bermond's ey (island). The channel is today resembled by Abbey Street. In the first millennium the river merged into the Thames by hooking north at three points. At least three tidally broadly flooded mouths existed, two of which were west of the former small island of Horsleydown and the third at the approximate site of St Saviour's Dock.https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/blog/2012/12/01/the-myth-of-canutes-canal-in- south-london/ see map published here, source not cited The Neckinger's northern mouth (now a surface water point of discharge into a deep, excavated inlet) divides the much-built up former marshland at the east end of Horsleydown island, known as Shad Thames and the low part of Bermondsey historically known as Jacob's Island to the east, which has also been built- up. History=Etymology In the 17th century convicted pirates were hanged at the wharf where the Neckinger entered the Thames. The name of the river is believed to derive from the term \\"devil's neckcloth\\", a slang term for the hangman's noose. In London Past and Present, published in 1891, Henry B. Wheatley argued that there was 'much good evidence' that 'the 'Devil's Neckinger'... the ancient place of punishment and execution' was at the site of the 'Dead Tree public-house' on Jacob's Island. Writing in The Inns of Old Southwark And Their Associations, in 1888, authors William Rendle and Philip Norman note that a place called Devol's Neckenger appears on a map in 1740 and, in the same location, in 1813, the Dead Tree inn. Route of Canute's Trench south of the River Thames from A History of London (1884) by W. J. Loftie. The early section of the Neckinger, where it crossed the Old Kent Road, was known by this name. Canute's Trench Historian Walter Besant says the Neckinger's early section, where it crosses the Kent Road, at Lock Bridge, was also known as Canute's Trench. In May, 1016, Danish Cnut the Great, who had invaded England, dug a trench through Southwark to allow his boats to avoid the heavily defended London Bridge. In 1173, a channel following a similar course was used to drain the Thames to allowing building work on London Bridge. Middle Ages In the 14th century, the crossing point of the Neckinger and the Old Kent Road was known as the of Seint Thomas, or St. Thomas-à-Watering, and was mentioned by Geoffrey Chaucer in The Canterbury Tales as the place where the pilgrims water their horses on their way to Thomas Becket's shrine. In the Tudor period St. Thomas-à-Watering was also the location for public executions. In the 16th century, herbalist and botanist John Gerard wrote of the wild willow herb that 'It is found nigh the place of execution at St. Thomas a Watering; and by a style on a Thames bank near to the Devil's Neckerchief on the way to Redriffe.' 1813 engraving of Chapel of the Hospital for Lepers in Kent Street, Southwark, called Le Lock. The upper section of the Neckinger passed by the hospital site and was known as Lock Stream. During the Middle Ages, the local religious house, Bermondsey Abbey, made use of the water of the Neckinger to power a Tide mill. The mill's early name was Redriff, also an early name for the present neighbouring district of Rotherhithe,BBC London, A Thames Tour of RotherhitheJohn Wells’s phonetic blog, Redriff, 31 October 2007 On 31 June 1536, the Abbey leased the mill to John Curlew, but the Dissolution of the Monasteries saw it privately acquired. At this time the Neckinger was navigable from the Thames up to the Abbey grounds. Local doctor, William Rendle, writing in Old Southwark And Its People, in 1878, describes a bridge on the Old Kent Road, dated to the time of Bermondsey Abbey, which was still visible as part of the sewer system in the 19th century. It was 'of a pointed arch of stone with six ribs, similar to the oldest part of the London Bridge and to those of Bow and Eltham. There are, however, no mouldings to the bridge; it was merely chamfered at the edges. Its date may be about the middle of the fifteenth century... The dimensions of the bridge are: width, 20 feet; span of arch, 9 feet.' In 1640, the City of London issued an order to 'make up and amend' the Lock Bridge as part of sewer works. According to Rendle the sewers were built up to adjoin the bridge at each side and it was a familiar landmark to 'sewer people' in the tunnels. During the 19th century improvements 'the ancient relic was not injured by the new works but necessarily covered up again. 17th and 18th centuries Private homes and businesses began to be built on the former Abbey grounds and the water of the Neckinger attracted tanners to its banks. In the late 1700s competition for the water led to the tanners bringing a suit against the mill owner which was won on the argument of 'ancient usages of the district' which ensured the inhabitants had the right to a supply of tidal water. Grange Walk) over the River Neckinger. The Jacob's Island district was notoriously squalid from early Victorian times until the mid-20th century. It was described by Charles Dickens in 1838 as \\"the filthiest, the strangest, the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in London\\", and by the Morning Chronicle in 1849 as \\"The very capital of cholera\\" and \\"The Venice of drains\\". In Dickens' novel, Oliver Twist a branch of the Neckinger is given the name Folly Ditch and is the place where the book's Bill Sikes meets his death. In the 1790s Neckinger Mill was established to produce paper, which continued until 1805 when the site was sold to the leather manufacturers Bevingtons. In 1838, the construction of a new line for the London and Greenwich Railway divided the mill land into two uneven portions, with further railway works taking place in 1841 and 1850. Modern era In 1935, Bevingtons moved most of their business to Dartford, keeping the smaller section of their divided site as a warehouse, and selling the larger portion to the Bermondsey Borough Council. When Bevingtons sold the warehouse in early 1980s it was converted into a residential development, and it has since been joined by new blocks of luxury flats, which coexist, with some friction, with the more bohemian houseboats moored offshore at Reed Wharf.

In 1851 the regiment was retitled as the 1st Regiment of Infantry, Punjab Irregular Force when the Trans Frontier Brigade, tasked with policing the volatile North-West Frontier, was expanded and renamed the Punjab Irregular Force (PIF), giving rise to the \\"Piffer\\" name adopted by the officers and men of the regiments of the PIF and still used to this day by their successor regiments. In 1857 the Indian Mutiny began and the regiment, like many other Indian units, remained loyal to the British. During the British-Indian siege of rebel-held Delhi (begun on 30 May) the 1st Punjab Infantry was part of the 3rd Column, commanded by Col. Campbell. On 14 September the column was tasked with storming the Kashmiri Gate—a part of the walled defences of Delhi—which they successfully achieved. Fierce fighting, however, ensued and Delhi was not fully retaken until 20 September. The rebellion was finally quelled by July 1858. In 1863 the 1st Punjab Infantry took part in the Umbeyla campaign in the North-West Frontier. At the Crag Picquet the regiment saw fierce fighting on 30 October, to such an extent that the regiment was compelled to withdraw from the hill; it was retaken shortly afterwards and two Victoria Crosses (VC) were later awarded. One of the VC recipients was Henry William Pitcher of the 4th Punjabis, who later joined the 1st Punjab Infantry and was killed in 1875 at Dera Ghazi Khan. Further fighting took place at Crag Picquet in November, which involved the regiment. In 1865 the Punjab Irregular Force was renamed the Punjab Frontier Force and the regiment's title was consequently changed to become the 1st Regiment of Infantry, Punjab Frontier Force. In 1878, the Second Afghan War began and the regiment participated as part of the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the Kandahar Field Force, commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Donald Stewart. The force captured the city of Kandahar on 8 January 1879. The regiment was awarded the Theatre Honour \\"Afghanistan 1878–79\\" for their participation in the initial campaign of the war. The conflict did not conclude until 1880. 1880–1922 The 1890s saw the 1st Punjab Infantry involved in several major operations against the hostile tribes on the North- West Frontier of India. These included Maizar, and Waziristan on 10 June 1897, when the regiment was ambushed in an action that signified the beginning of a large tribal uprising against the British. The beginning of the 20th century gave the regiment no respite, and it took part in further operations in Waziristan in 1901. That same year it became, simply, the 1st Punjab Infantry. In 1903, the regiment was designated a rifle regiment and retitled as the 55th Coke's Rifles (Frontier Force), named in honour of the regiment's founder. In 1908, the Regiment took part in the Mohmand expedition on the North-West Frontier.1st Regiment of Punjab Infantry, Punjab Frontier Force, 1889. Punjabi Musalman Naik, Dogra 320px The 55th did not serve abroad during the First World War but the regiment—which comprised companies of Afridis, Punjabi Musulmans, Sikhs and Yusufzais—saw active service on the North-West Frontier for the duration of the war, fighting many of the numerous marauding tribes that populated the area. Many men of the regiment did, however, see service abroad during the war while attached to other units. In 1915, Jemadar Mir Dast, while attached to the 57th Wilde's Rifles (Frontier Force), was awarded the 55th's first (and only) Victoria Cross for his distinguished actions at Wieltie, Belgium. Mir Dast's brother, Mir Mast, had deserted from his regiment—the 58th—to the Germans. It is rumoured that Mir Mast received the Iron Cross while fighting for them. 1922–47 In 1921–22, a major reorganization was undertaken in the British Indian Army leading to the formation of large infantry groups of four to six battalions. Among these was the 13th Frontier Force Rifles, formed by grouping the 55th Coke's Rifles with the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 56th Punjabi Rifles, the 57th Wilde's Rifles, 58th Vaughan's Rifles and 59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force). The Coke's new designation was 1st Battalion (Coke's) 13th Frontier Force Rifles. The 55th's uniform of rifle green colour was adopted as the uniform of the new regiment. During the Second World War, the 1/13th Frontier Force Rifles (Coke's) was part of the 9th Indian Division based on the west coast of Malaya. The battalion fought in the disastrous Malayan Campaign against the Japanese, which led to the surrender of British forces at Singapore on 15 February 1942. The battalion was re-raised in 1946. In 1945, 13th Frontier Force Rifles dropped its regimental number \\"13\\" to become Frontier Force Rifles. 1947 onwards Upon the independence in 1947, the Frontier Force Rifles was allotted to Pakistan Army. In 1948, 1 FF Rifles fought in the Kashmir War against India. The battalion fought with great gallantry at Chakothi in the Jhelum Valley, and foiled all Indian attempts to advance towards Muzaffarabad. In 1956, the Frontier Force Rifles and the Pathan Regiment were merged with the Frontier Force Regiment, and 1 FF Rifles was redesignated as 7th Battalion (Coke's) The Frontier Force Regiment or 7 FF. During the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965, the battalion again distinguished itself in the Battle of Chawinda.Attiqur Rahman, Lt Gen M. (1980).

Early life Warner was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad. His mother, Rosa Cadiz, was of Spanish origin, his father of an English colonial family. He was educated at Harrison College, and then sent to England to Rugby School and Oriel College, Oxford. Cricket career As a right-hand batsman, Warner played first-class cricket for Oxford University, Middlesex and England. He played 15 Test matches, captaining in 10 of them, with a record of won 4, lost 6. He succeeded in regaining The Ashes in 1903–04, winning the series against Australia 3–2. However he was less successful when he captained England on the tour of South Africa in 1905–06, suffering a resounding 1–4 defeat, the first time England had lost to South Africa in a Test match. He was also to have captained England on the 1911–12 tour of Australia, but fell ill. He was unable to play in any of the Tests, with Johnny Douglas taking over the captaincy. He is the only batsman to carry his bat through the innings in his first Test match. He was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1904 and also in 1921, making him one of two to have received the honour twice (the usual practice is that it is only won once: the other is Jack Hobbs). The second award marked his retirement as a county player after the 1920 season, in which he captained Middlesex to the County Championship title. In the mid-1920s he was Chairman of Selectors, and in 1926 during industrial strife served as a Special Constable. He did not, however, play in another first-class fixture until 1926–27, when he captained a Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side to Argentina, in which the four representative matches against the host nation were accorded first-class status. MCC scraped a win in the series by two games to one, with one match drawn. He played one more first-class match, in 1929 for the MCC against the Royal Navy. Cricket management After retiring as a player, he became a tour manager, most notably on the infamous \\"Bodyline\\" tour of Australia in 1932–33. He was the chairman of the England Test selectors for several years in the 1930s. He later became President of the Marylebone Cricket Club. He was knighted for his services to cricket in 1937. Cricket writing Warner wrote extensively on cricket. He detailed his Ashes Tests and a history of Lord's Cricket Ground. He founded The Cricketer magazine. He was cricket correspondent of the Morning Post from 1921 to 1933, and subsequently of the Daily Telegraph. Family life He married Agnes in the summer of 1904 and had two sons, Esmond and John, and a daughter, Elizabeth. He died, aged 89, at West Lavington, West Sussex. His brother Aucher Warner not only captained the first combined West Indies side in the West Indies during the 1896–97 season (playing against A. A. Priestley's XI and for Trinidad vs. Lord Hawke's touring team, which included Pelham Warner) but also the first West Indian touring side to England in 1900.

The eventual outcome was the creation of what is now called the tank. Established in February 1915 by First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, the Committee was composed mainly of naval officers, politicians and engineers. It was chaired by Eustace Tennyson d’Eyncourt, Director of Naval Construction at the Admiralty. Formation The committee was formed at Churchill's instruction in February 1915. It started with only three members: d’Eyncourt, as chairman; Flight Commander Thomas Hetherington of the Royal Naval Air Service Armoured Car Squadron; and Colonel Wilfred Dumble of the Naval Brigade. Hetherington had proposed a large wheeled landship, estimated to weigh some 300 tons. A former Royal Engineer, Dumble had managed the London Omnibus Co. and been brought back to service in response to the urgent need for transport by the Royal Naval Division in Antwerp - he had been an adjutant to Colonel R.E.B. Crompton, who was trying to develop cross-country vehicles for the Army. Dumble recommended Crompton to the committee as an expert on heavy traction. The committee's activities were concealed from Kitchener at the War Office, the Board of the Admiralty, and the Treasury, all of whom were expected to block the project. Tank development The Committee conducted a number of trials with various wheeled and tracked vehicles, and work was in progress on a prototype vehicle (later to become Little Willie) when in July 1915 the Committee's existence came to the attention of the War Office. This led to its operations being taken over by the Army and a number of its members transferring from the Navy. From December, 1915 the word \\"tank\\" was adopted as a codename for the vehicles in development, and the Landship Committee became known officially as the Tank Supply Committee.

The Juvenalorden, or \\"Juvenal Order\\", of 1907 was founded on the initiative of then student, later clergyman August Lindh, remembered for his widespread Swedish translation of the German student song (in Swedish: O, gamla klang - och jubeltid!), and with a tenuous connection to the original society in the form of the aging physician M. Aspelin, who had during his student days in Uppsala been introduced into the Juvenals by its principal figure, the poet and composer Gunnar Wennerberg (1817-1901) himself. The purpose of the order (as stated in the Nordisk familjebok article on the society from 1924) was to work \\"for the ennobling of youthful happiness in the academic life\\". As a revival of the earlier society the order worked to both conserve and develop aspects of older upsaliensian student life, which had acquired a classical character in the mid 19th century; important aspects of this is the male student choir singing and the performance of spex, a form of comical musical theatre usually based on themes from history or classical literature and characterized by its humorous anachronisms.\\"Juvenalorden\\", in Nordisk familjebok, vol. 36, Supplement (1924), col. 836.

Agam trained at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem, before moving to Zürich, Switzerland in 1949, where he studied under Johannes Itten (1888–1967) at the Kunstgewerbe Schule, and was also influenced by the painter and sculptor Max Bill (1908–1994). In 1951 Agam went to Paris, France, where he still lives. He has a daughter and two sons, one of whom is the photographer Ron Agam. Artistic career Agam's first solo exhibition was at the Galerie Craven, Paris, in 1953,Exhibition at Galerie Craven, Paris, 30 October–12 November 1953. Ragon, p. 33. and he exhibited three works at the 1954 Salon des Réalités Nouvelles.Ragon, p. 7. He established himself as one of the leading pioneers of kinetic art at the Le Mouvement exhibition at the Galerie Denise René, Paris, in 1955, alongside such artists as Jesús Rafael Soto, Carlos Cruz-Díez, Pol Bury, Alexander Calder and Jean Tinguely. In 1964, Agam wrote his artistic credo, unchanged since then. > My intention was to create a work of art which would transcend the visible, > which cannot be perceived except in stages, with the understanding that it > is a partial revelation and not the perpetuation of the existing. My aim is > to show what can be seen within the limits of possibility which exists in > the midst of coming into being. Agam's work is usually abstract, kinetic art, with movement, viewer participation and frequent use of light and sound. His works are placed in many public places. His best known pieces include \\"Double Metamorphosis III\\" (1965), \\"Visual Music Orchestration\\" (1989) and fountains at the La Défense district in Paris (1975) and the \\"Fire and Water Fountain\\" in the Dizengoff Square in Tel Aviv (1986). He is also known for a type of print known as an Agamograph, which uses barrier-grid animation to present radically different images, depending on the angle from which it is viewed. The lenticular technique was executed in large scale in the square \\"Complex Vision\\" (1969) which adorns the facade of the Callahan Eye Foundation Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. Agam had a retrospective exhibition in Paris at the Musée National d'Art Moderne in 1972, and at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 1980, among others. His works are held in numerous museum collections including the Museum of Modern Art and the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum. He is the subject of two documentary films by American filmmaker Warren Forma: \\"Possibilities of Agam\\" (1967) and \\"Agam and...\\" (1980). In 1996, he was awarded the Jan Amos Comenius Medal by UNESCO for the \\"Agam Method\\" for visual education of young children. He designed and created the winner's trophy for the 1999 Eurovision Song Contest that was held in Jerusalem. In 2009, at age 81, Agam created a monument for the World Games in Kaohsiung, Taiwan titled \\"Peaceful Communication with the World\\". It consists of nine 10m high hexagon pillars positioned in diamond or square formation. The sides of the pillars are painted in different patterns and hues, totaling more than 180 shades. One side of each pillar is also lined to segment the structure into sections, so that children's perception of the pillar will change as they grow, because they will see a different pillar at a different height. One of Agam's more notable creations is the Hanukkah Menorah at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 59th Street in New York City, sponsored by the Lubavitch Youth Organization. The 32-foot-high, gold colored, 4,000 pound steel structure is recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the World's Largest Hanukkah Menorah. It uses real oil lamps, which are lighted every year during Hanukkah with the aid of cherry-picking machines. In May 2014, Agam's piece \\"Faith- Visual Pray\\" was presented to Pope Francis by El Al Israel Airlines' president, David Maimon. The piece included significant symbols of both Jewish and Christian faiths. Agam is the highest-selling Israeli artist. In a Sotheby's New York auction in November 2009, when his \\"4 Themes Contrepoint\\" was sold for $326,500, he said: \\"This does not amaze me … my prices will go up, in keeping with the history I made in the art world.\\" A year later, his \\"Growth\\", an outsize kinetic painting done in oil on a wood panel, which was shown at the 1980 retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum, estimated at $150,000 to $250,000, sold for the record-breaking sum of $698,000. In 2018, the 3,200-square-meter Yaacov Agam Museum of Art (YAMA) opened in the artist's hometown of Rishon LeZion, Israel. Agam told the Jerusalem Post that it is \\"the only museum in the world that is dedicated to art in motion.\\" File:Dizingoff Square.JPGFountain in Dizengoff Square in Tel Aviv File:Yaacov Agam sheba.jpgWork by Agam at the Sheba Medical Center, Israel File:Dan Hotel Tel Aviv 20120916 01.jpgFacade of Dan Hotel, Tel Aviv File:Agam - Eighteen levels.jpgEighteen Levels (1971) See also * Visual arts in Israel * List of public art in Israel ReferencesBibliography  * External links  Living people People from Rishon LeZion Jews in Mandatory Palestine Israeli Jews Jewish sculptors Modern painters 20th-century Israeli sculptors Contemporary sculptors Jewish artists Jewish Israeli artists Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design alumni Sandberg Prize recipients Op art Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Yaacov Agam"},{"id":"1336692","text":":See also Blizna, Podlaskie Voivodeship. For the Polish film of this name see The Scar (1976 film). Blizna is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Ostrów, within Ropczyce-Sędziszów County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south-eastern Poland. It lies approximately north of Ostrów, north of Ropczyce, and north-west of the regional capital Rzeszów. It has a population of about 250. History=World War II V-2 rocket being recovered from the Bug River near Sarnaki From 5 November 1943 to early July 1944 there was an SS military base near Blizna, from which 139 A4 (also known as V-2) rockets were launched for experimental purposes and for training.Zak, Anatoly: RussianSpaceWeb.Com: 2009Jena1806.Com: 2009 After the air raid on Peenemünde on 17 August 1943 it was decided that the training and testing should be done in southeast Poland outside of the range of the Allied bombers. However test launches also continued at Peenemuende until 21 February 1945. Because the rockets launched from Blizna - in contrast to the rockets launched from Peenemünde - flew over a populated area, there was also some destruction of buildings. Wernher von Braun, a central figure in Germany's pre-war rocket development program, and post-war director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, worked at the Blizna test site and personally visited the test missile impact areas to troubleshoot any problems discovered during trials.Gatland, Kenneth William: Project Satellite: 1958 p82 V-2 rocket in Blizna The missile testing ground at Blizna was quickly located by the Polish resistance movement, the Armia Krajowa thanks to reports from local farmers. Armia Krajowa field agents even managed to obtain pieces of the fired rockets, by arriving on the scene before German patrols. In early March 1944, British Intelligence Headquarters received a report of an Armia Krajowa agent (code name: ‘Makary’) who had covertly surveyed the Blizna railway line and observed a freight car heavily guarded by SS troops containing ‘an object which, though covered by a tarpaulin, bore every resemblance to a monstrous torpedo’. Subsequently, a plan was formed to make an attempt to capture a whole unexploded V-2 rocket and transport it to Britain. Around 20 May 1944, a relatively undamaged V-2 rocket fell on the swampy bank of the Bug River near the village of Sarnaki and local Poles managed to hide it before German arrival. The rocket was then dismantled and smuggled across Poland. In late July 1944, the Polish resistance (Home Army and V1 and V2) secretly transported parts of the rocket out of Poland in Operation Most III (Bridge III), for analysis by British intelligence. replica V2 missile in Blizna V-2 War Museum. In July 1944 the advance of Soviet troops forced the base at Blizna to be evacuated and launch activities were moved to the Tuchola Forest.

It is the fourth-oldest town in South Africa, after Cape Town, Stellenbosch, and Swellendam. The town was the center of a short-lived republic in the late 18th century. The town was a starting point for Great Trek groups led by Gerrit Maritz and Piet Retief and furnished large numbers of the Voortrekkers in 1835–1842. Graaff-Reinet is home to more national monuments than any other town or city in South Africa. It is also known for being a flourishing market for agricultural produce, noted for its mohair industry, and sheep and ostrich farming. History Boer republic of Graaff-Reinet (blue) and other Dutch territories around 1795 Graaff-Reinet was established by the Dutch East India Company in 1786. The town is named after then-governor of the Cape Colony, Cornelis Jacob van de Graaff, and his wife. The town was originally established as a trading post to expand trading inland from the Cape Colony. In 1795, the town's burghers, who were annoyed by company taxation, proclaimed themselves to be the independent \\"Colony of Graaff-Reinet\\". The burghers then requested guardianship from the government of the Netherlands. Similar action was subsequently taken by the burghers of Swellendam. Before the authorities at Cape Town could take decisive measures against the rebels, they were compelled to capitulate to the British who had invaded and occupied the Cape. In January 1799, Marthinus Prinsloo, a leader of the 1795 independence movement, rebelled again but surrendered the following April. Prinsloo and nineteen others were imprisoned in the Cape Town castle. After trial, Prinsloo and another commandant were sentenced to death. Other conspirators were sentenced to exile. The sentences were not carried out and the prisoners were released in March 1803, on the retrocession of the Cape to the Netherlands. In 1801, there was another revolt in Graaff Reinet, but due to the measures of General Francis Dundas, the acting governor of the Cape Colony, peace was soon restored. In February 1803, due to the 1802 signing of the Treaty of Amiens, the British returned the Cape Colony to the Netherlands, then named the Batavian Republic. On 13 August 1814 the Cape Colony was formally ceded to Britain by a convention under which Dutch vessels were entitled to resort freely to the Cape of Good Hope for the purposes of refreshment and repairs. Britain agreed on 13 August 1814 to pay five million sterling to the United Netherlands for the Dutch possession at the Cape. The Cape Colony received a degree of independence in 1872 when \\"Responsible Government\\" was declared in South Africa. In 1877, the government of Prime Minister John Molteno began construction of the railway line connecting Graaff-Reinet to Port Elizabeth on the coast. This railway was officially opened on 26 August 1879.Burman, Jose (1984), Early Railways at the Cape. Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, p.68. Graaff Reinet became the centre of British military operations for the Eastern Cape during the Second Boer War. In 1901, a number of captured Boer rebels were tried in the town for crimes ranging from high treason, murder, attempted murder, arson and robbery. Nine were sentenced to death, with eight of these being executed by firing squad on the outskirts of the town, while the ninth sentence was carried out in Colesberg. A monument stands in the town to commemorate these fallen Boers. Geography The town lies above the sea and is built on the banks of the Sundays River, which rises a little further north on the southern slopes of the Sneeuberge, and splits into several channels here. The town is home to a number of tourist attractions, including the Dutch Reformed church in the town, which is a prominent stone building with seating to accommodate 1,500 people. The building is influenced by the architecture of Salisbury Cathedral in England. The town is also home to tourist sites such as The Valley of Desolation, Camdeboo National Park and the Reinet House Museum, a Cape Dutch building, formerly the Dutch Reformed Church parsonage. Demographics In the South African National Census of 2011, the population of Graaff-Reinet and the township of uMasizakhe was recorded as 35,672, which included 8,393 households. 62.2% of these residents described themselves as \\"Coloured\\", 28.2% as \\"Black African\\", and 8.7% as \\"White\\". The dominant language was Afrikaans, which was the first language of 76.0% of the population. 18.9% spoke Xhosa, and 3.6% spoke English. The regions' indigenous languages, which include the Khoekhoe and Bushman languages, are rarely spoken, as historically the locals were prohibited from speaking their native languages.

It contains the Tuchola Forest National Park, which is at the core of the Tuchola Forest Biosphere Reserve, designated by UNESCO in 2010.  Landscape  The area was formed during the last glacial age and is covered with low hills and more than 900 post-glacial lakes. With 3,200 km² of dense spruce and pine forest, the area is one of the biggest forests in Poland and Central Europe. Since 1996, part of the area has been designated as the Tuchola Forest National Park, covering . Approximately 30% of the area is inhabited by the Kociewiacy people. The largest towns in the area are Czersk and Tuchola.  History  It formed part of Poland since the establishment of the state in the 11th century. After the First Partition of Poland in 1772 the area was annexed by Prussia, and from 1871 it was part of the German Empire. Under German rule, near the village of Grupa, a military exercise area Truppenübungsplatz Gruppe was established, in which medical research was conducted, leading to publication of the name in scientific reports of the early 20th century. During World War I, pacifist doctor Georg Friedrich Nicolai was banished from Berlin to the remote area which had to be restored in 1919 to Poland as a result of the Treaty of Versailles, after Poland regained independence in November 1918. Rudzki Most massacre of Poles, carried out by Nazi Germany in 1939 In 1939, during the invasion of Poland at the very beginning of World War II, the major Battle of Tuchola Forest was fought in the area. Soon, the former military test area was occupied again by German troops,Heinz Guderian: Erinnerungen eines Soldaten, \\"Ich hatte am 3.9 ... meinen Sohn Kurt wiedergesehen und mich dabei an den Türmen von Kulm, meiner Geburtsstadt, erfreut, die vom Ostufer der Weichsel herüberwinkten.

Approximately 107 missiles were fired in a southbound direction for tests and training purposes. In January 1945 the site had to be evacuated before the Red Army offensive overran the area. After World War II, the forest was a safe haven for many anti-communist partisans, among them Zygmunt Szendzielarz.

Biography Of Belarussian/Polish extraction, Gurko was educated in the Imperial Corps of Pages, entered the hussars of the Imperial Guard as a sub-lieutenant in 1846, became captain in 1857, adjutant to Alexander II of Russia in 1860, colonel in 1861, commander of the 4th Hussar Regiment of Mariupol in 1866, and major-general of the emperor's suite in 1867. He subsequently commanded the grenadier regiment, and in 1873 the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, of the cavalry of the Imperial Guard. Although he took part in the Crimean War, being stationed at Belbek, his claim to distinction is due to his service in the Turkish war of 1877. He led the spearhead of the Russian invasion, took Tarnovo on July 7, crossed the Balkans by the Haim Boaz pass—which debouches near Hainkyoi—and, despite considerable resistance, captured Uflani, Maglizh and Kazanlak; on July 18 he attacked Shipka, which was evacuated by the Turks the following day. Thus within 16 days of crossing the Danube, Gourko had secured three Balkan passes and created a panic at Constantinople. He then made a series of successful reconnaissances of the Tundzha valley, cut the railway in two places, occupied Stara Zagora () and Nova Zagora (), checked the advance of Suleiman Pasha's army and returned again over the Balkans. In October he was appointed commander of the allied cavalry, and attacked the Plevna line of communication to Orhanie with a large mixed force, captured Gorni-Dubnik, Telish and Vratsa and, in the middle of November, Orhanie itself. Pleven was isolated, and after its liberation in December Gourko led his troops amidst snow and ice over the Balkans to the fertile valley beyond. He liberated Sofia and decisively defeated Suleiman Pasha at the Battle of Philippopolis and occupied Adrianople. The armistice at the end of January 1878 stopped further operations. With the help of Carol I of Romania and a few other Russian commanders such as : Michael Nikolaevich and Iosif Vladimirovich Gourko, the Russian Empire managed to break free Romania, Serbia and Montenegro. After a Russian victory the Treaty of Berlin was signed. In 1879–1880, Gurko was a governor of St. Petersburg, and from 1883-1894 Governor-General of Poland, where he enforced the Russification policies of Alexander III. He died in 1901, near the city of Tver. Honour Gurko was made a count and decorated with the 2nd class of St. George, Order of the Cross of Takovo and other orders. Gurkovo town in South-central Bulgaria and General Yosif V. Gurko Street in Sofia, Bulgaria are named after him.

The grandson of the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson and the son of the Governor-General of Australia, he succeeded his father to the title in 1928, having been known before that as \\"The Hon Lionel Tennyson\\". He should not be confused with his uncle, after whom he was named, who was also \\"The Hon Lionel Tennyson\\". Life and career As a schoolboy at Eton College, Tennyson was a fast bowler, but by the time he took up regular first-class cricket with Hampshire in 1913, he bowled very rarely. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1914. During World War I he served with The Rifle Brigade in France. He was Mentioned in Despatches twice and three times wounded. His two younger brothers were killed in the war. Tennyson played nine Test matches for England, five of them on the tour of South Africa under Johnny Douglas in 1913/14. In 1921, England having lost six Test matches in succession to the Australians under Warwick Armstrong, Tennyson was recalled to the side for the second Test at Lord's, and though the game was again lost, he scored an undefeated 74 in the second innings against Jack Gregory and Ted McDonald at their fastest. That innings led him to be appointed captain for the three remaining matches of the series, succeeding Douglas. The next game was lost; the final two matches were left drawn. At Headingley in the first of these three games as captain, Tennyson split his hand while fielding in the Australians' first innings but, patched up with what Wisden called a \\"basket guard\\", he made 63 and 36. He led several non-Test match tours overseas, to India, South Africa and the West Indies. Tennyson was captain of Hampshire from 1919 to 1932. He was in charge of the side in the remarkable match against Warwickshire in 1922, when Hampshire were bowled out for 15 runs in their first innings and, having been forced to follow on, then scored 521 in the second innings and won the match by 155 runs. In 1933 he published his autobiography, From Verse to Worse. Returning from his second war-wound to the Western Front he records: \\"I have never liked travelling light and so, though the amount of kit I arrived with may, in fact have aroused a certain amount of astonishment, I was quickly forgiven by my commanding officer as well as by everyone else, when they found out that it included, among other things, a case of champagne.\\" He published a second volume of memoirs, Sticky Wickets, in 1950. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of 51st (London) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (a Territorial Army unit based in Chelsea, London) on 9 August 1931 and held the position until 1947.Monthly Army List 1931–39.Burke's Peerage.

He retired after the 2007 season, ending a career with nine years in English football at clubs Wimbledon, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, and Aston Villa, and in Norway he played for Molde, Rosenborg, Lyn, and Strømsgodset.  In Norway  Leonhardsen started his career in Clausenengen before he, as a 19-year-old, moved to Premier Division side Molde in 1989. Two years later he was brought to Norwegian champions Rosenborg. Leonhardsen won the honorable Kniksen award as the best midfielder in 1989, 1991, 1992 and 1993. He was voted the Player's Player of the Year in Norway in 1994.  In England  Leonhardsen moved to Wimbledon in the Premier League the following season, where he made an instant impact on the left wing. He spent three seasons with Wimbledon, playing on the left wing, and helped them reach the semi finals of both the FA Cup and Football League Cup in his final season there. He was sold to Liverpool for £3.5million in May 1997, and was initially a regular member of the first team under the management of Roy Evans. After Gerard Houllier's continental revolution of Liverpool from 1999, Leonhardsen fell out of favour at Anfield and was sold to Tottenham Hotspur, before joining Aston Villa on a free transfer in August 2002.  Return to Norway  He moved back to Norway in 2004 to join FC Lyn Oslo, where he became the captain. He signed a two-year contract with second-level club Strømsgodset IF from Drammen in December 2005. Leonhardsen retired aged 37 after helping securing Strømsgodset's promotion to Tippeligaen in 2006, and later retaining their place in the league in 2007. Leonhardsen began working as a youth coach at his former club Lyn. In 2018 he became assistant coach of Mjøndalen IF. International career Leonhardsen made 86 appearances for the Norway national team, scoring 19 goals. He was part of the 1994 and 1998 FIFA World Cup squads. In Norway, the expression \\"a Leo run\\" is derived from Leonhardsen's running capacity and smart movements. He seemed to have an uncanny instinct for anticipating when and where a loose ball would present him with a scoring chance, directing and timing his runs to make sure he'd be there to exploit it - hence his impressive scoring rate for a midfielder. He is reckoned as somewhat of a cult hero and a symbol of the Norway national team success in the 1990s. He earned great respect during his career due to his highly professional approach to the game.

Norwegian citizens in the affected region * Formally identified dead: 84 (updated 18 May 2005) * People who were in the affected areas at the time of the disaster: ca. 7,660 Problems in reporting The first few days, the Norwegian Foreign office was in charge of collating names and information about people reported missing or with possible whereabouts in the environs of the hit areas. According to their information, 21 Norwegian citizens were confirmed to be killed during the calamity, and about 1,600 were either missing or of unknown whereabouts presumptively in the general South and East Asia regions. On 30 December the national police took over the lists, which actually had partial information (duplicate or triplicate listings etc.) on more than 8,000 entry lines. Through the work of the police, those listed as missing were whittled down to below 300. On 3 January the police published a list with names of 279 missing persons, and that there were 16 confirmed deaths instead of the originally reported 21 (no list published). The drop from 21 to 16 was explained by more stringent demands as to legal presumption of death. It soon transpired that there had been a fair amount of miscommunication, reporting snags and computer errors, even typing errors. Many people who learned that they were on their lists, were able to call in and were removed. By the afternoon of 5 January, the names of missing persons had been lowered to 80. It was furthermore stated that the number of confirmed deaths had, again, been over-reported due to a typing error, dropping the number of confirmed dead from 16 to 12. Apparently due to the stringency of presumed death declarations, a Norwegian Tamil woman who was killed in the waves in a part of Sri Lanka controlled by the Tamil Tigers, found after one day, identified by local friends and relatives and buried in Sri Lanka on 2 January, remained listed as \\"missing\\" on the official list. But on 6 January her name was removed, and the statistics of confirmed dead increased from 12 to 13. On 18 January the Police published numbers of dead and missing according to an altered system. The number of deceased (eight) included only those whose formal identification had been confirmed by the pertinent civic authorities. The number of missing (then eighty) thus included some people whose bodies had been identified by relatives or friends, but not yet by the authorities. History Thailand has been a Norwegian tourist destination of great popularity for many years. In recent years, more and more Norwegians have also started to celebrate Christmas in the warmth of the south Asian weather, instead of celebrating at home, where the weather can be rough, with temperatures far below zero degrees Celsius as well as snow. In light of these facts, the impact of the catastrophe has a large psychological and personal impact on the small nation. In Sri Lanka, there are reports of three Norwegians dead, one of them a Norwegian citizen born in the Tamil part of the country and doing volunteer work at an orphanage in her town of birth. The tradition of vacationing there is much more limited than Thailand. The Norwegian Embassy was in a state of emergency following the disaster. Impact This disaster exerted significant psychological impact everywhere in the world. Tourism is South-East Asia's biggest export and it was disrupted considerably. However, it is making a comeback with more and more tourists visiting each year. A memorial for the victims of the tsunami catastrophe of 26 December 2004 was initiated by the Norwegian government. The memorial is meant to be a dignified place for reflection and contemplation for all people affected by catastrophes.

In boyhood, he gained a knowledge of plants from his grandfather, who was an apothecary, and later he qualified as a doctor in medicine. Pursuing the study of botany in various parts of France and other countries, he began to take notice of the relation between the distribution of plants and the soils and subsoils. In this way his attention came to be directed to minerals and rocks. In 1746, he communicated to the Academy of Sciences in Paris a memoir on the distribution of minerals and rocks, and this was accompanied by a map on which he had recorded his observations. He thus, as remarked by W. D. Conybeare, \\"first carried into execution the idea, proposed by Martin Lister years before, of geological maps.\\" In the course of his journeys he made a large collection of fossils and figured many of them, but he had no clear ideas about the sequence of strata. He made observations also on the degradation of mountains by rain, rivers and sea; and he was the first to ascertain the existence of former volcanoes in the district of Auvergne. In 1759, Guettard was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He died in Paris on 7 January 1786. His publications include: * Observations sur les plantes (2 vols, 1747) * Histoire de la découverte faite en France de matières semblables à celles dont la porcelaine de la Chine est composée (1765) * Mémoires sur différentes parties des sciences et arts (5 vols, 1768–1783) * Mémoires sur la minéralogie du Dauphiné (2 vols, 1779). * Atlas et description minéralogiques de la France (1780) * \\"Atlas minéralogique de la France, volume de planches\\" (1780) See The Founders of Geology, by Sir A Geikie (1897).

Story The story follows a boy named Genki Sakura, who is a key player of the Monster Rancher video games. After winning a tournament hosted by the game's creators, Genki wins a special CD that he can use to unlock a special monster in his game at home. However, upon using this disk in his game console, he finds himself transported to a world of monsters that, much like Genki's game, are given life by scanning special stone disks within temples. There, he meets a girl named Holly, who is seeking a stone disk containing a legendary Phoenix that will save the land from the tyranny of an evil ruler named Moo. Upon attempting to use the disk Genki had won to try and release the monster, they bring forth a different sort of monster, which Genki names Mocchi. Wanting to free the land from Moo's rule, Genki, Holly, Mocchi and their other monster companions go on a quest to find the stone disk that contains the Phoenix. Release ADV Films licensed the home video rights to the first 12 episodes, which the company released on DVD. ADV also released the entire first season of Monster Rancher on VHS. The series was brought to the US by BKN and dubbed by Ocean Studios. After Monster Rancher went off the air in the US, ADV halted its release of the series on home video and DVD. In 2005, BKN International A.G. licensed the DVD rights for 73 episodes of the Monster Rancher anime series to Digiview Productions LLC for US and Canadian mass retail market distribution. Digiview only released one DVD containing episodes 1 through 5 at select Wal-Marts and other select places that sell $1 DVDs in February 2006. Eventually, this DVD was reissued to include up to episode 8. The Digiview releases were canceled after this release. The series was later made available to watch on Hulu. Discotek Media released the series in three English-dubbed DVD box sets in 2014, and a single box set with the original Japanese audio subtitled and uncut on July 10, 2015. An SD on BD set was released by Discotek Media on May 29, 2018.

He was known by the nickname Colonel House, although he had performed no military service. He was a highly influential back-stage politician in Texas before becoming a key supporter of the presidential bid of Wilson in 1912. Having a self-effacing manner, he did not hold office but was an \\"executive agent\\", Wilson's chief advisor on European politics and diplomacy during World War I (1914–18) and at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. In 1919 Wilson, suffering from a series of small strokes, broke with House and many other top advisors, believing they had deceived him at Paris. Early years He was born July 26, 1858 in Houston, Texas, the last of seven children of Mary Elizabeth (Shearn) and Thomas William House Sr. His father an emigrant from England by way of New Orleans, who became a prominent Houston businessman, with a large role in developing the city and served a term as its mayor. An ardent Confederate, he had also sent blockade runners against the Union blockade in the Gulf of Mexico during the American Civil War. House attended Houston Academy, a school in Bath, England, a prep school in Virginia, and Hopkins Grammar School, New Haven, Connecticut. He went on to study at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, in 1877 where he was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity. He left at the beginning of his third year to care for his sick father, who died in 1880. He married Loulie Hunter on August 4, 1881. Texas business and politics On his return to Texas, House ran his family's business. He eventually sold the cotton plantations, and invested in banking. He was a founder of the Trinity and Brazos Valley Railway. House moved to New York City about 1902. In 1912, House published anonymously a novel called Philip Dru: Administrator, in which the title character leads the democratic western U.S. in a civil war against the plutocratic East, becoming the dictator of America. Dru as dictator imposes a series of reforms which resemble the Bull Moose platform of 1912 and then vanishes.Lasch, pp. 230–35. House helped to make four men governor of Texas: James S. Hogg (1892), Charles A. Culberson (1894), Joseph D. Sayers (1898), and S. W. T. Lanham (1902). After their elections, House acted as unofficial advisor to each. In 1893, Hogg appointed House to his military staff with the rank of lieutenant colonel, a position which came with a title but no actual military responsibilities. He was reappointed by Culberson, Sayers, and Lanham, and was soon known as \\"Colonel House,\\" the title which he used for the rest of his career. Edward M. House, from An Onlooker in France 1917–1919 by William Orpen, 1921. Plate LXXXV A \\"cosmopolitan progressive\\" who examined political developments in Europe, House was an admirer of the British Liberal welfare reforms instigated between 1906 and 1914, noting to a friend in June 1911 that David Lloyd George > is working out the problems which are nearest my heart and that is the > equalization of opportunity …. The income tax, the employers' liability act, > the old age pension measure, the budget of last year and this insurance bill > puts England well to the fore. We have touched these problems in America but > lightly as yet but the soil is fallow. Advisor to Wilson After House withdrew from Texas politics and moved to New York, he became an advisor, close friend and supporter of New Jersey governor Woodrow Wilson in 1911, and helped him win the Democratic presidential nomination in 1912. He became an intimate of Wilson and helped set up his administration. House was offered the cabinet position of his choice (except for Secretary of State, which was already pledged to William Jennings Bryan) but declined, choosing instead \\"to serve wherever and whenever possible.\\" House was even provided living quarters within the White House. He continued as an advisor to Wilson particularly in the area of foreign affairs. House functioned as Wilson's chief negotiator in Europe during the negotiations for peace (1917–1919) and as chief deputy for Wilson at the Paris Peace Conference. In the 1916 presidential election, House declined any public role but was Wilson's top campaign advisor: \\"he planned its structure; set its tone; guided its finance; chose speakers, tactics, and strategy; and, not least, handled the campaign's greatest asset and greatest potential liability: its brilliant but temperamental candidate.\\" After Wilson's first wife died in 1914, the President was even closer to House. However, Wilson's second wife, Edith, of whom he had commissioned the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862–1947) to paint a portrait in 1916, disliked House, and his position weakened. It is believed that her personal animosity was significantly responsible for Wilson's eventual decision to break with House. Col. House and President Wilson in 1915. Diplomacy House threw himself into world affairs, promoting Wilson's goal of brokering a peace to end World War I. He spent much of 1915 and 1916 in Europe, trying to negotiate peace through diplomacy. He was enthusiastic but lacked deep insight into European affairs and relied on the information received from British diplomats, especially the British foreign secretary Edward Grey, to shape his outlook. Nicholas Ferns argues that Grey's ideas meshed with House's. Grey's diplomatic goal was to establish close Anglo-American relations; he deliberately built a close connection to further that aim. Thereby Grey re-enforced House's pro- Allied proclivities so that Wilson's chief advisor promoted the British position.Nicolas Ferns, \\"Loyal Advisor? Colonel Edward House's Confidential Trips to Europe, 1913–1917.\\" Diplomacy & Statecraft 24.3 (2013): 365-382. After a German U-boat sank without warning the British passenger liner on 7 May 1915, with 128 Americans among the 1198 dead, many Americans called for war. The ship was carrying war munitions, although this was not publicly revealed at the time.http://www.centenarynews.com/article?id=1616 Wilson demanded that Germany respect American neutral rights, and especially not sink merchant ships or passenger liners without giving the passengers and crew the opportunity to get into lifeboats, as required by international law. Tension escalated with Germany, until Germany agreed to Wilson's terms. House felt that the war was an epic battle between democracy and autocracy; he argued the United States ought to help Britain and France win a limited Allied victory. However, Wilson still insisted on neutrality. House played a major role in shaping wartime diplomacy. He supported Thomas Garrigue Masaryk Czechoslovak legions especially in Russia as well.PRECLÍK, Vratislav.

In September 1918, Wilson gave House the responsibility for preparing a constitution for a League of Nations. In October 1918, when Germany petitioned for peace based on the Fourteen Points, Wilson charged House with working out details of an armistice with the Allies. Edward M. House in 1920 Paris conference Time cover, 25 Jun 1923 House helped Wilson outline his Fourteen Points and worked with the president on the drafting of the Treaty of Versailles and the Covenant of the League of Nations.

On May 30, 1919 House participated in a meeting in Paris which laid the groundwork for establishment of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Throughout 1919, House urged Wilson to work with Senator Henry Cabot Lodge to achieve ratification of the Versailles Treaty, but Wilson refused to deal with Lodge or any other senior Republican. The conference revealed serious policy disagreements and personality conflicts between Wilson and House. Wilson became less tolerant and broke with his closest advisors, one after another. Later, he dismissed House's son-in-law, Gordon Auchincloss, from the American peace commission when it became known the young man was making derogatory comments about him. In February 1919, House took his place on the Council of Ten, where he negotiated compromises unacceptable to Wilson. The following month, Wilson returned to Paris. He decided that House had taken too many liberties in negotiations, and relegated him to the sidelines. After they returned to the US later that year, the two men never saw or spoke to each other again. In the 1920s, House strongly supported membership of both the League of Nations and the Permanent Court of International Justice. In 1932, House supported Franklin D. Roosevelt for the presidency without joining his inner circle. Although he became disillusioned with the course of the New Deal after Roosevelt's election, he expressed his reservations only privately. House was a confidant of William E. Dodd, Roosevelt's first Ambassador to Nazi Germany, acting at times as Dodd's intermediary with the White House and the State Department.Larson, Erik (2011) In the Garden of Beasts New York: Broadway Paperbacks. pp. 38, 136, 152, 217, 245 Death and legacy House died on March 28, 1938 in Manhattan, New York City, following a bout of pleurisy. As a (one time) novelist, House had much more influence with the book Philip Dru: Administrator than has been appreciated. Historian Maxwell Bloomfield notes the impact of the character Dru, as written by Wilson's Secretary of the Interior. In his diary, Franklin K. Lane wrote the following:Peaceful Revolution: Constitutional Change and American Culture from Progressivism to the New Deal, Harvard University Press The Letters of Franklin K. Lane, Personal and Political :Colonel House's Book, Philip Dru, favors it, and all that book has said should be, comes about slowly, even woman suffrage. The President comes to Philip Dru in the end. And yet they say that House has no power.... Edward M. House statue in Warsaw House was buried at Glenwood Cemetery in Houston. After his death, politicians, diplomats and statesman from around the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom expressed their admiration for House and regrets about his death, including President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Cordell Hull, Fiorello LaGuardia, Al Smith, Mackenzie King, David Lloyd George, Lord Tyrrell, and Lord Robert Cecil.Staff/Associated Press (March 29, 1938) \\"British Remember Wisdom of House\\" The New York TimesStaff (March 29. 1938) \\"Roosevelt Praises Service of House\\" The New York TimesStaff (March 29, 1938) \\"Deaths: House, Edward M.\\" The New York Times House Park, a high school football stadium in Austin, Texas, stands on House's former horse pasture.

A statue of House, financed by Ignacy Jan Paderewski in 1932, is located at Skaryszewski Park in Warsaw. House is considered a hero in Poland for his advocacy of Polish independence after World War I, which was incorporated into the Fourteen Points and resulted in the reestablishment of the Polish nation.

He is probably best known for his ground-breaking work on marine reptile fossils in the 1820s, including important papers for the Geological Society of London on ichthyosaur anatomy and the first published scientific description of a plesiosaur.  Life and career=Childhood and education He was a grandson of John Conybeare, bishop of Bristol (1692–1755), a notable preacher and divine, and son of Dr William Conybeare, rector of St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate. Born in London, he was educated there at Westminster School, then went in 1805 to Christ Church, Oxford, where in 1808 he took his degree of BA, with a first in classics and second in mathematics, and proceeded to MA three years later. Early career Having entered holy orders he became in 1814 curate of Wardington, near Banbury, and he accepted also a lectureship at Brislington near Bristol. During this period he was one of the founders of the Bristol Philosophical Institution (1822). He was rector of Sully in Glamorganshire from 1823 to 1836, and vicar of Axminster from 1836 to 1844. He was appointed Bampton lecturer in 1839, called and later published in a book as An Analytical Examination into the Character, Value, and Just Application of the Writings of the Christian Fathers During the Ante Nicene Period. He was instituted to the deanery of Llandaff in 1845. Geology Attracted to the study of geology by the lectures of Dr John Kidd he pursued the subject with ardour. As soon as he had left college he made extended journeys in Britain and on the continent, and he became one of the early members of The Geological Society. Both Buckland and Sedgwick acknowledged their indebtedness to him for instruction received when they first began to devote attention to geology. Illustration of plesiosaur skeletal anatomy from Conybeare's 1824 paper describing the skeleton found by Anning He contributed geological memoirs to the Transactions of the Geological Society, the Annals of Philosophy, and the Philosophical Magazine. In 1821, in collaboration with Henry De la Beche he distinguished himself by describing, from fragmentary remains, the saurian Plesiosaurus in a paper for the Geological that also contained an important description and analysis of all that had been learned to that point about the anatomy of ichthyosaurs including the fact that there had been at least three different species. His predictions about the plesiosaur were proved correct by the discovery of a nearly complete skeleton by Mary Anning in 1823, which Conybeare described to the Geological Society in 1824. Among his most important memoirs is that on the south-western coal district of England, written in conjunction with Dr Buckland, and published in 1824. Diagram of the skeletal anatomy of an Ichthyosaur from an 1824 paper by Conybeare He wrote also on the valley of the Thames, on Elie de Beaumont's theory of mountain- chains, and on the great landslip which occurred near Lyme Regis in 1839 when he was vicar of Axminster. His principal work, however, is the Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales (1822), being a second edition of the small work issued by William Phillips and written in co-operation with that author. The original contributions of Conybeare formed the principal portion of this edition, of which only Part 1, dealing with the Carboniferous and newer strata, was published. It affords evidence throughout of the extensive and accurate knowledge possessed by Conybeare; and it exercised a marked influence on the progress of geology in Britain. Conybeare was an advocate of gap creationism.McIver, Thomas Allen. (1989). Creationism: Intellectual Origins, Cultural Context, and Theoretical Diversity. University of California, Los Angeles.Lynch, John M. (2002). Creationism and Scriptural Geology. Thoemmes. p. 10. He was a fellow of the Royal Society and a corresponding member of the Institute of France. In 1844, he was awarded the Wollaston medal by the Geological Society of London. His elder brother, the scholar John Josias Conybeare, was also interested in geology. Death W D Conybeare's Grave and Memorial, Llandaff Cathedral.

Foster in sporting literature,Altham, p.144. was an English first-class cricketer and footballer. He is the only man to have captained England at both sports. One of seven Foster brothers who were all educated at Malvern College and who all played cricket for Malvern and for Worcestershire, Foster was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In 1903 he scored 287 on Test debut, setting a world record for the highest Test score. Cricket career Foster was educated at Malvern College and University College, Oxford. He first played for Oxford University Cricket Club in 1897; in addition to cricket, he also represented Oxford at football, racquets and golf. However, although he did fairly well, it was not until 1899 that his beautiful and immaculate driving to the off-side made him into one of the finest batsmen of his time. He had played for Worcestershire while they were still a minor county but in 1899, their inaugural season as a first-class county, he and his brother Wilfrid Foster both scored two hundreds in a match (against Hampshire), a feat which remains unique in county cricket. In 1900, as captain of Oxford, he scored 171 to set the record for the highest individual score in the Varsity Match, and he scored 102 not out and 136 for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's, the first man to score two centuries in a match in the Gentleman v Players series. In total, Foster scored 930 runs at an average of 77.5 for Oxford in the 1900 season, a record in University cricket. For these performances, Foster was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1901 and the following year a superb run of form for Worcestershire resulted in him scoring 1,957 runs, at an average of 54.36. However, business prevented him representing the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in Australia the following year and England undoubtedly missed his brilliant batting. Moreover, apart from one match against Warwickshire, he could devote no time to first-class cricket in May and June 1902, ruling him out of contention for an England place against Australia. In 1903, his appearances were restricted to three matches in June and August, but England were desperate for a captain for that winter's Ashes tour. Foster was (oddly) able to arrange to be away from England. Although one might have feared that he would be out of practice, in the first Test at Sydney in 1903, Foster scored 287. This was the highest score in Test cricket until 1930 (surpassed by Andy Sandham), and remains the highest score by a debutant and the third highest by a batsman of any nationality against Australia, home or away (surpassed only by Len Hutton's 364 in 1938 & Ross Taylor's 290 in 2015). For more than a century, Foster also held the record for the highest score in a test match at the SCG, his score not being beaten until Australian Michael Clarke scored 329 not out against India in January 2012. Foster did not follow it up, until the final Test on a vicious wicket at Melbourne, where he top-scored in both innings with 18 (in a total of 61 all out) and, having been promoted to open, an excellent 30 (out of 101 all out). In the following three seasons Foster could spare no time for cricket, apart from August 1905 (when he scored 246 on his first appearance), but in 1907 he was able to find time to play regularly from the beginning of June. His batting was as good as ever in a summer of appalling wickets and helped Worcestershire (fourteenth of sixteen counties in 1906) to rise to equal second with Yorkshire. He captained England in the three-match series against South Africa in 1907, winning one match and drawing two. Offered the captaincy of the MCC for the 1907/1908 Ashes tour, Foster declined because business commitments were monopolising his attention. After the Third Test of 1907 he could spare time for only two more first-class matches, one in 1910 (when he scored 133 against Yorkshire) and one in 1912. However, in Saturday club cricket, he never lost his brilliance. In one club match in 1909 he scored 261 in just 75 minutes. Football career In football, Foster played as a forward for the Corinthians in the early 1900s, scoring 22 goals in 26 matches. He also played for Old Malvernians, a team made up of ex pupils from Malvern College. He played five matches for England between 1900 and 1902, making his debut against Wales on 26 March 1900. In his second game, against Ireland at the Dell, Southampton, he scored his first international goal in a 3–0 victory.England v Ireland, 09 March 1901 – 11v11 match report. 11v11.com. Retrieved on 17 May 2018. C. B. Fry played at full- back in the same game. Foster was awarded the captaincy against Wales in his final appearance on 3 March 1902, which ended in a 0–0 draw.

Overview The album, originally titled None More Negative and released in 1990 under the group's former name Repulsion, launched the band's career. The album has a rawness that was prominent in Peter Steele's previous band, Carnivore, but it incorporates elements that became standard for Type O Negative, merging styles including doom metal, gothic rock, new wave and industrial music. Slow, Deep and Hard is a semi- autobiographical album with heavy amounts of black humor, based on a failed relationship in which the vocalist/bass guitarist Peter Steele was involved. In keeping with the band's notable humor, the album's cover artwork is a blurred image of sexual penetration.

The displacement of rock layers can provide information on how and why Earth's lithosphere changes throughout geologic time. There are different mechanisms which lead to vertical displacement such as tectonic activity, and isostatic adjustments. Tectonic activity leads to vertical displacement when crust is rearranged during a seismic event. Isostatic adjustments result in vertical displacement through sinking due to an increased load or isostatic rebound due to load removal.  Tectonic causes of vertical displacement  Displacement of the dark mudstone layer pictured is a part of the surface layer above (not pictured), indicating a vertical displacement of this layer of rock.Vertical displacement resulting from tectonic activity occurs at divergent and convergent plate boundaries. The movement of magma in the asthenosphere can create divergent plate boundaries as the magma begins to rise and protrude weaker lithospheric crust. Subsidence at a divergent plate boundary is a form of vertical displacement which occurs when a plate begins to split apart. As intrusive magma widens the rift zone of a divergent plate boundary the layers of crust on the surface above the rift will subside into the rift, creating a vertical displacement of those layers of surface crust. Convergent plate boundaries create orogenies such as the Laramide orogeny that raised the Rocky Mountains. For this orogen event dense oceanic crust from the Pacific plate subducts beneath the less dense continental crust of the North American plate as they converge. This subduction induced the compression of the bounded western region of the North American plate which created the uplift of different layers of rock. This vertical displacement created the various mountain formations which are cumulatively known as the Rocky Mountain range. Earthquakes are one mechanism that leads to vertical displacement of crust. The fracturing of land during an earthquake creates a fault when land is displaced during the event.Rafferty, John P., (2013). \\"Geological Sciences\\". New York, NY: Rosen Publishing Group. 9781615305445. https://www.vitalsource.com/sa/en-us/products/geological-sciences-britannica- educational-v9781615305445 The throw of the fault is a term used to describe and quantify the magnitude of this displacement.  Glacial isostatic adjustment  top: Image shows isostatic depression due to the weight of ice on top of it. bottom: Image shows isostatic rebound due to load removal. Changes in glaciation can lead to the vertical displacement of crust. Glaciers and ice sheets residing on top of landmass result in an isostatic depression, or sinking, in a section of lithospheric crust due to the weight of the ice. Likewise, isostatic rebound, or uplift, occurs when glaciers and ice sheets recede. Using asthenosphere viscosity data researchers are able to determine the rate by which isostatic rebound occurs. Isostatic rebound occurrence rate can be determined by comparing local viscosities to the maximum viscosity of the asthenosphere. Areas with higher viscosity are subject to quick isostatic rebound while in regions of low viscosity crustal uplift occurs at a slower rate. Uplift is still occurring through isostatic rebound from the Last Glacial Maximum. Glacial isostatic rebound leads to sea level regression which can be measured using 14C dating to determine the age of sublittoral sediment in different regions along the seafloor.

INLD was founded in October 1996 as Haryana Lok Dal (Rashtriya) by Choudhary Devi Lal, who served as Deputy Prime Minister of India in the V.P. Singh's Cabinet and Chief Minister of Haryana twice.His son Om Prakash Chautala is the president.  History  Chaudhary Devi Lal founded the Bharatiya Lok Dal in 1974 after winning the election from Rori constituency to the Haryana Legislative Assembly, while the INLD was founded in the year 1987 after assembly election. The 1982 and 1987 elections were fought under the name Lok Dal (LKD). The party renamed into its current name in 1998. The party was a member of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and thus part of the Bharatiya Janata Party led government from 1998 to 2004 at the Federal level. INLD has performed poorly in all the four consecutive general elections held since 1998. It lost consecutive assembly elections for Haryana in 2005, 2009 and 2013. It failed to win any seats in Lok Sabha in 2004 and 2009 general elections, despite being in alliance with Bharatiya Janata Party in 2009. In the Lok Sabha elections 1999, the INLD had an electoral alliance with BJP in Haryana. Each party contested five of the ten seats in the state. All ten were elected. In 2000, Chautala was elected as the Chief Minister of Haryana for the fifth time. In the 2000 state assembly elections, INLD won 47 out of the 90 seats. Later, INLD broke its alliance with the BJP and left the NDA and the government. In 2004, the party contested on 20 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Chandigarh, but 14 of those lost their deposits. Its 10 candidates in Haryana secured 22.43 per cent votes, 5 candidates secured 0.52 per cent votes in Rajasthan, 4 candidates secured 0.02 per cent votes in Uttar Pradesh and its lone candidate UT secured 6.61 per cent votes in Chandigarh. However, in the 2005 Haryana state assembly elections, INLD lost its majority, winning just 9 out of the 90 seats compared to the Congress party's 67 seats. In 2009, the INLD won 31 seats. On 16 January 2013, Om Prakash Chautala and Ajay Chautala were sent jail after a New Delhi court sentenced them to ten years imprisonment under various provisions of the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act. In the 16th Lok Sabha elections, the INLD won on two seats. Dushyant Chautala was elected for a Hisar Lok Sabha Seat and Charanjeet Singh Rori was elected for a Sirsa Lok Sabha Seat. In Rohtak at Chhotu Ram Stadium, INLD made the Guinness World Records for having supporters apply for 10,450 eye donations in 8 hours. In the 2014 Legislative Assembly election, the INLD won 19 seats and is the chief opposition party in the state. Abhay Singh Chautala has been elected as Leader of Opposition in the State of Haryana. On 14 April 2015, Indian National Lok Dal, Janata Dal (United), Janata Dal (Secular), Rashtriya Janata Dal, Samajwadi Party, and Samajwadi Janata Party (Rashtriya) announced that they would merge into a new national Janata Parivar Alliance.http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/janata-parivar- merger-has-suffered-a-setback-gowda/article8070745.ece Jannayak Janta Party emerged from a split in the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) which itself had been caused by infighting among the Chautala family.

A large round Coca-Cola sign overlooks Five Points, atop the Olympia Building on the east side of the intersection between Edgewood Avenue and Decatur Avenue. The nearly 50-foot tall sign has a 33-foot lighted neon face and faces up and down Peachtree Street. A lighted portion at the bottom of the sign gives the current time and temperature. At the other corners of Five Points are located: Woodruff Park (northeast); the William- Oliver Building (northwest); Georgia State University's Andrew Young School of Policy Studies (southwest); and a parking garage (southeast). On a triangular island in the intersection stands the George Beasley sculpture Five Points Monument, alluding to the water tower formerly standing on the spot as well as the streetcar tracks that once existed in the intersection. History Prior to the arrival of white settlers, Five Points was the intersection of two Creek Indian trails, the Pitch Tree (corrupted to Peachtree) Trail and the Sandtown Trail. In 1845, George Washington Collier opened a grocery store at what is now Five Points, and the store later served as Atlanta's first post office in 1846. In 1848, Five Points served as the location of Atlanta's first mayoral election. Moses Formwalt became Atlanta's first mayor, defeating Jonathan Norcross. In 1875, Atlanta's drinking water system began with the construction of three artesian wells at Five Points. The system delivered water to Atlanta's residents via wooden pipes. Until the 1960s, Five Points represented the central hub of Atlanta. With the advent of urban sprawl, white flight, and the development of shopping malls, the economic and demographic center of Atlanta shifted northward, and Five Points went into decay. By the 21st century, the area was revitalizing, mostly due to the expansion of Georgia State University, which maintains a large footprint in Five Points.

The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, extant, extinct or dormant (Eardley of Spalding to Goojerat). 5 (2nd ed.). London, p.340, note (d) William III de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby (c. 1193 – 28 March 1254) of Chartley Castle in Staffordshire, was an English nobleman and major landowner, unable through illness to take much part in national affairs. From his two marriages, he left numerous children who married into noble and royal families of England, France, Scotland and Wales. Origins He was the son and heir of William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby (c.1168-c.1247), by his wife Agnes de Kevelioc, a daughter of Hugh de Kevelioc, 3rd Earl of Chester (by his wife Bertrada de Montfort). Career In 1230 he accompanied King Henry III to France and attended Parliament in London in the same year. Like his father, he suffered from gout from youth and after the 1230s took little part in public affairs, travelling always in a litter. He was accidentally thrown from his litter into the River Great Ouse while crossing a bridge at St Neots in Huntingdonshire and, although he escaped death, never recovered from the effects of the accident. He succeeded to the title of his father in 1247, but only lived another seven years, dying on 28 March 1254. Landholdings Unable to play any part at court or at war, he followed his father in managing the family's landholdings. Their original lands were centred on Tutbury Castle, stretching beyond Staffordshire into the south of Derbyshire and the west of Nottinghamshire. The death in 1232 of his uncle Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, brought him vast new estates, including Chartley Castle in Staffordshire, much of Lancashire between the Rivers Ribble and Mersey and many manors in Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire. He continued the policy of encouraging the growth of towns and markets, exploiting the forests of Needwood and Duffield Frith, and taking advantage of rising prices in commodities and land values. By the time of his death his income placed him among the top six English nobles, but he also left his son considerable debts. Marriages & issue He married twice: To Sybil Marshal He married firstly Sibyl Marshal, a daughter of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, by his wife Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembroke, by whom he had seven daughters: *Agnes de Ferrers (d. 11 May 1290), who married (as his second wife) William de Vesci (d.1253); *Isabel de Ferrers (died before 26 November 1260), who married (1) Gilbert Basset, of Wycombe, and (2) (as his second wife) Reginald II de Mohun, feudal barony of Dunster in Somerset, father-in- law of her sister Joan. *Maud de Ferrers (died 12 March 1298), who married (1) Simon de Kyme (died 1248), (2) William de Vivonne (died 1259), and (3) Amaury IX, Viscount of Rochechouart. *Sibyl de Ferrers, who married (as his first wife) Frank de Bohun, of Midhurst, great-nephew of Savaric FitzGeldewin;The Sibyl de Ferrers who married John de Vipont, Lord of Appleby, was her aunt. *Joan de Ferrers (died 1267) married (1) Sir John de Mohun, feudal baron of Dunster (died 1253) and (2) (as his first wife) Sir Robert Aguillon of Addington ; *Agatha de Ferrers (died May 1306), married Hugh Mortimer, younger son of Ralph de Mortimer; *Eleanor de Ferrers (died 16 October 1274) married (1) William de Vaux, (2) in about 1252 (as his 3rd wife) Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester, and (3) in about 1265 Roger de Leybourne.

They are pharmacologically inert substances that are given intravenously. They increase the osmolarity of blood and renal filtrate. Two examples are mannitol and isosorbide. In the nephron, osmotic diuretics act at the portions of the nephron that are water-permeable. Osmotic diuretics work by expanding extracellular fluid and plasma volume, therefore increasing blood flow to the kidney. This washes out the cortical medullary gradient in the kidney. This stops the loop of Henle from concentrating urine, which usually uses the high osmotic and solute gradient to transport solutes and water. These agents can also act at other parts of the body. For example, they can be used to reduce intracranial and intra-ocular pressure. Osmotic diuretics increase plasma volume, but because they do not cross the blood-brain barrier, this does not affect the nervous system. In effect, this is the cause of their action reducing locally the plasma volume in the nervous system.  Mechanism of action  Osmotic diuretics have their major effect in the proximal convoluted tubule and the descending limb of the Loop of Henle. These sites are freely permeable to water. Through osmotic effects, they also oppose the action of ADH in the collecting tubule. The presence of a nonreabsorbable solute such as mannitol prevents the normal absorption of water by interposing a countervailing osmotic force. As a result, urine volume increases. The increase in urine flow rate decreases the contact time between fluid and the tubular epithelium, thus reducing sodium as well as water reabsorption. The resulting natriuresis is of lesser magnitude than the water diuresis, leading eventually to excessive water loss and hypernatremia. Any osmotically active agent that is filtered by the glomerulus but not reabsorbed causes water to be retained in these segments and promotes a water diuresis. Such agents can be used to reduce intracranial pressure and to promote prompt removal of renal toxins. The prototypical osmotic diuretic is mannitol. Mannitol lowers the intra cranial pressure through two effects in the brain.The first, rheological effect, reduces blood viscosity, and promotes plasma expansion and cerebral oxygen delivery. In response, cerebral vasoconstriction occurs due to autoregulation, and cerebral blood volume is decreased. The second effect occurs through creation of an osmotic gradient across the blood-brain barrier, leading to the movement of water from the parenchyma to the intravascular space. Brain tissue volume is decreased and, therefore, ICP is lowered.

He was also a rugby union player for Leicester at full back or three quarter. Early life Jones was born in 1872 in Shelton, Nottinghamshire, and educated at Bedford Modern School and Jesus College, Cambridge. Cricket career Jones played for Cambridge University, Nottinghamshire, London County and England. He was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1900. Jones was the first substitute to keep wicket in a Test match, when he did so against Australia at The Oval in 1905. He was a brilliant, sometimes impetuous, opening batsman and a leg-break and googly bowler. In 1903 he made what was then the highest-ever score by a Nottinghamshire batsman, scoring an unbeaten 296 against Gloucestershire at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. Jones played 12 Test matches for England, but lost the two games he captained. He led Nottinghamshire to the County Championship in 1907 and was captain of the 1907/08 England tour to Australia. But he only appeared in two matches because of illness. He remained captain of Nottinghamshire until a few months before his death from tuberculosis, in Dunstable, Bedfordshire. Rugby career Jones made 15 appearances for Bedford between 1889 and 1895 before moving to Leicester Tigers in 1895. He was appointed captain between 1896–99 and then again between 1902–04. He was club captain when Tigers secured their first piece silverware, the Midlands Counties Cup, though missed the final through injury. He was captain in the victorious finals of 1899, 1903 and 1904 and played in the victorious final of 1900 and 1901. He became the first player to pass 500 points for the club against Moseley in 1903. Between 1906-12 he refereed 5 rugby internationals, including France's first test victory against Scotland in 1911.

He was born in the north. Biography As a boy Hardyng entered the service of Sir Henry Percy (Hotspur), with whom he was present at the Battle of Shrewsbury (1403). He then passed into the service of Sir Robert Umfraville, under whom he was constable of Warkworth Castle, Northumberland, and Kyme Castle, Lincolnshire. He was in Umfraville's retinue at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 and in the sea-fight before Harfleur in 1416.John Hardyng, Chronicle: Edited from British Library MS Lansdowne 204, James Simpson and Sarah Peverley (eds), Vol 1 (Kalamazoo: Medieval Institute Publications, 2015), pp. 1-6. In 1424 Hardyng was at Rome, where at the instance of Cardinal Beaufort he consulted the chronicle of Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus. Upon the death of Umfraville in 1436, Hardyng retired to the Augustinian Priory at Kyme, where he wrote the two versions of his chronicle and where he probably lived till his death about 1465. Hardyng was a man of antiquarian knowledge, and under Henry V was employed to investigate the feudal relations of Scotland to the English crown. For this purpose he visited Scotland. By his own account, he spent three and a half years mapping the terrain and securing documents related to English sovereignty.Peverley, BBC Arts Feature Later, he would incorporate material from his Scottish mission, most notably the first independent map of Scotland, into a history of Britain written for Henry V's son.Peverley, Medieval Maps of Scotland For his services he says that Henry V promised Hardyng the manor of Geddington in Northamptonshire. Many years after, in 1440, he had a grant of £10 a year for similar services. In 1457 there is a record of the delivery of documents relating to Scotland by Hardyng to the earl of Shrewsbury, and his reward by a further pension of £20.John Hardyng, Chronicle: Edited from British Library MS Lansdowne 204, James Simpson and Sarah Peverley (eds), Vol 1 (Kalamazoo: Medieval Institute Publications, 2015), pp. 1-6. Manuscript map of Scotland by John Hardyng, 15th century It is clear that Hardyng was well acquainted with Scotland, and James I is said to have offered him a bribe to surrender his papers. But most of the documents, which are still preserved in the Record Office, have been shown to be forgeries, and were probably manufactured by Hardyng himself.John Hardyng, Chronicle: Edited from British Library MS Lansdowne 204, James Simpson and Sarah Peverley (eds), Vol 1 (Kalamazoo: Medieval Institute Publications, 2015). Hardyng spent many years on the composition of a rhyming chronicle of England. His services under the Percies and Umfraville's gave him opportunity to obtain much information of value for fifteenth century history. It was written and rewritten to suit his various patrons. The original edition ending in 1437 had a Lancastrian bias and was dedicated to Henry VI and his family. Afterwards he began preparing a version for Richard, Duke of York, and continued the chronicle for Richard's son, Edward IV. A reference to Edward's wife, Elizabeth Woodville, in the prologue indicates that Hardyng was still working on his second version in 1464.John Hardyng, Chronicle: Edited from British Library MS Lansdowne 204, James Simpson and Sarah Peverley (eds), Vol 1 (Kalamazoo: Medieval Institute Publications, 2015). Versions The first version is preserved in Lansdowne manuscript 204 in the British Library, and the best of the later versions in Oxford, Bodleian Library, Arch. Selden B. 10. Richard Grafton printed two editions in January 1543 and Stow, who was acquainted with a different version, censured Grafton on this point somewhat unjustly. Sir Henry Ellis published the longer version of Grafton with some additions from the Selden and Harley manuscripts in 1812. Professors Sarah Peverley and James Simpson have edited the first chronicles, and Peverley is editing the second version.John Hardyng, Chronicle: Edited from British Library MS Lansdowne 204, James Simpson and Sarah Peverley (eds), Vol 1 (Kalamazoo: Medieval Institute Publications, 2015).

It is usually denoted by the Greek letter λ (lambda) and is often used in reliability engineering. The failure rate of a system usually depends on time, with the rate varying over the life cycle of the system. For example, an automobile's failure rate in its fifth year of service may be many times greater than its failure rate during its first year of service. One does not expect to replace an exhaust pipe, overhaul the brakes, or have major transmission problems in a new vehicle. In practice, the mean time between failures (MTBF, 1/λ) is often reported instead of the failure rate. This is valid and useful if the failure rate may be assumed constant – often used for complex units / systems, electronics – and is a general agreement in some reliability standards (Military and Aerospace). It does in this case only relate to the flat region of the bathtub curve, which is also called the \\"useful life period\\". Because of this, it is incorrect to extrapolate MTBF to give an estimate of the service lifetime of a component, which will typically be much less than suggested by the MTBF due to the much higher failure rates in the \\"end-of-life wearout\\" part of the \\"bathtub curve\\". The reason for the preferred use for MTBF numbers is that the use of large positive numbers (such as 2000 hours) is more intuitive and easier to remember than very small numbers (such as 0.0005 per hour). The MTBF is an important system parameter in systems where failure rate needs to be managed, in particular for safety systems. The MTBF appears frequently in the engineering design requirements, and governs frequency of required system maintenance and inspections. In special processes called renewal processes, where the time to recover from failure can be neglected and the likelihood of failure remains constant with respect to time, the failure rate is simply the multiplicative inverse of the MTBF (1/λ). A similar ratio used in the transport industries, especially in railways and trucking is \\"mean distance between failures\\", a variation which attempts to correlate actual loaded distances to similar reliability needs and practices. Failure rates are important factors in the insurance, finance, commerce and regulatory industries and fundamental to the design of safe systems in a wide variety of applications. Failure Rate Data Failure rate data can be obtained in several ways. The most common means are: ;Estimation:From field failure rate reports, statistical analysis techniques can be used to estimate failure rates. For accurate failure rates the analyst must have a good understanding of equipment operation, procedures for data collection, the key environmental variables impacting failure rates, how the equipment is used at the system level, and how the failure data will be used by system designers. ;Historical data about the device or system under consideration: Many organizations maintain internal databases of failure information on the devices or systems that they produce, which can be used to calculate failure rates for those devices or systems. For new devices or systems, the historical data for similar devices or systems can serve as a useful estimate. ;Government and commercial failure rate data: Handbooks of failure rate data for various components are available from government and commercial sources. MIL- HDBK-217F, Reliability Prediction of Electronic Equipment, is a military standard that provides failure rate data for many military electronic components. Several failure rate data sources are available commercially that focus on commercial components, including some non-electronic components. ;Prediction: Time lag is one of the serious drawbacks of all failure rate estimations. Often by the time the failure rate data are available, the devices under study have become obsolete. Due to this drawback, failure-rate prediction methods have been developed. These methods may be used on newly- designed devices to predict the device's failure rates and failure modes. Two approaches have become well known, Cycle Testing and FMEDA. ; Life Testing: The most accurate source of data is to test samples of the actual devices or systems in order to generate failure data. This is often prohibitively expensive or impractical, so that the previous data sources are often used instead. ;Cycle Testing: Mechanical movement is the predominant failure mechanism causing mechanical and electromechanical devices to wear out. For many devices, the wear-out failure point is measured by the number of cycles performed before the device fails, and can be discovered by cycle testing. In cycle testing, a device is cycled as rapidly as practical until it fails. When a collection of these devices are tested, the test will run until 10% of the units fail dangerously. ;FMEDA: Failure modes, effects, and diagnostic analysis (FMEDA) is a systematic analysis technique to obtain subsystem / product level failure rates, failure modes and design strength. The FMEDA technique considers: * All components of a design, * The functionality of each component, * The failure modes of each component, * The effect of each component failure mode on the product functionality, * The ability of any automatic diagnostics to detect the failure, * The design strength (de-rating, safety factors) and * The operational profile (environmental stress factors). Given a component database calibrated with field failure data that is reasonably accurate , the method can predict product level failure rate and failure mode data for a given application. The predictions have been shown to be more accurate than field warranty return analysis or even typical field failure analysis given that these methods depend on reports that typically do not have sufficient detail information in failure records.W. M. Goble, \\"Field Failure Data – the Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\\" exida, Sellersville, PA Failure modes, effects, and diagnostic analysis Failure Rate in the Discrete Sense The failure rate can be defined as the following: :The total number of failures within an item population, divided by the total time expended by that population, during a particular measurement interval under stated conditions. (MacDiarmid, et al.) Although the failure rate, \\\\lambda (t), is often thought of as the probability that a failure occurs in a specified interval given no failure before time t, it is not actually a probability because it can exceed 1. Erroneous expression of the failure rate in % could result in incorrect perception of the measure, especially if it would be measured from repairable systems and multiple systems with non-constant failure rates or different operation times. It can be defined with the aid of the reliability function, also called the survival function, R(t)=1-F(t), the probability of no failure before time t. ::\\\\lambda(t) = \\\\frac{f(t)}{R(t)}, where f(t) is the time to (first) failure distribution (i.e. the failure density function). ::\\\\lambda(t) = \\\\frac{R(t_1)-R(t_2)}{(t_2-t_1) \\\\cdot R(t_1)} = \\\\frac{R(t)-R(t+\\\\Delta t)}{\\\\Delta t \\\\cdot R(t)} \\\\\\\\! over a time interval \\\\Delta t = (t_2-t_1) from t_1 (or t) to t_2. Note that this is a conditional probability, where the condition is that no failure has occurred before time t. Hence the R(t) in the denominator. Hazard rate and ROCOF (rate of occurrence of failures) are often incorrectly seen as the same and equal to the failure rate. To clarify; the more promptly items are repaired, the sooner they will break again, so the higher the ROCOF. The hazard rate is however independent of the time to repair and of the logistic delay time. Failure rate in the continuous sense Hazard function h(t) plotted for a selection of log-logistic distributions. Calculating the failure rate for ever smaller intervals of time results in the ' (also called hazard rate'), h(t). This becomes the instantaneous failure rate or we say instantaneous hazard rate as \\\\Delta t approaches to zero: :h(t)=\\\\lim_{\\\\Delta t \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{R(t)-R(t+\\\\Delta t)}{\\\\Delta t \\\\cdot R(t)}. A continuous failure rate depends on the existence of a failure distribution, F(t), which is a cumulative distribution function that describes the probability of failure (at least) up to and including time t, :\\\\operatorname{Pr}(T\\\\le t)=F(t)=1-R(t),\\\\quad t\\\\ge 0. \\\\\\\\! where {T} is the failure time. The failure distribution function is the integral of the failure density function, f(t), :F(t)=\\\\int_{0}^{t} f(\\\\tau)\\\\, d\\\\tau. \\\\\\\\! The hazard function can be defined now as :h(t)=\\\\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)}=\\\\frac{f(t)}{R(t)}. Exponential failure density functions. Each of these has a (different) constant hazard function (see text). Many probability distributions can be used to model the failure distribution (see List of important probability distributions). A common model is the exponential failure distribution, :F(t)=\\\\int_{0}^{t} \\\\lambda e^{-\\\\lambda \\\\tau}\\\\, d\\\\tau = 1 - e^{-\\\\lambda t}, \\\\\\\\! which is based on the exponential density function. The hazard rate function for this is: :h(t) = \\\\frac{f(t)}{R(t)} = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda e^{-\\\\lambda t}}{e^{-\\\\lambda t}} = \\\\lambda . Thus, for an exponential failure distribution, the hazard rate is a constant with respect to time (that is, the distribution is \\"memory-less\\"). For other distributions, such as a Weibull distribution or a log-normal distribution, the hazard function may not be constant with respect to time. For some such as the deterministic distribution it is monotonic increasing (analogous to \\"wearing out\\"), for others such as the Pareto distribution it is monotonic decreasing (analogous to \\"burning in\\"), while for many it is not monotonic. Decreasing Failure Rate A decreasing failure rate (DFR) describes a phenomenon where the probability of an event in a fixed time interval in the future decreases over time. A decreasing failure rate can describe a period of \\"infant mortality\\" where earlier failures are eliminated or corrected and corresponds to the situation where λ(t) is a decreasing function. Mixtures of DFR variables are DFR. Mixtures of exponentially distributed random variables are hyperexponentially distributed. Renewal processes For a renewal process with DFR renewal function, inter-renewal times are concave. Brown conjectured the converse, that DFR is also necessary for the inter-renewal times to be concave, however it has been shown that this conjecture holds neither in the discrete case nor in the continuous case. Applications Increasing failure rate is an intuitive concept caused by components wearing out. Decreasing failure rate describes a system which improves with age. Decreasing failure rates have been found in the lifetimes of spacecraft, Baker and Baker commenting that \\"those spacecraft that last, last on and on.\\" The reliability of aircraft air conditioning systems were individually found to have an exponential distribution, and thus in the pooled population a DFR. Coefficient of variation When the failure rate is decreasing the coefficient of variation is ⩾ 1, and when the failure rate is increasing the coefficient of variation is ⩽ 1. Note that this result only holds when the failure rate is defined for all t ⩾ 0 and that the converse result (coefficient of variation determining nature of failure rate) does not hold. Units Failure rates can be expressed using any measure of time, but hours is the most common unit in practice. Other units, such as miles, revolutions, etc., can also be used in place of \\"time\\" units. Failure rates are often expressed in engineering notation as failures per million, or 10−6, especially for individual components, since their failure rates are often very low. The Failures In Time (FIT) rate of a device is the number of failures that can be expected in one billion (109) device-hours of operation. Xin Li; Michael C. Huang; Kai Shen; Lingkun Chu. \\"A Realistic Evaluation of Memory Hardware Errors and Software System Susceptibility\\". 2010\\\\. p. 6. (E.g. 1000 devices for 1 million hours, or 1 million devices for 1000 hours each, or some other combination.) This term is used particularly by the semiconductor industry. The relationship of FIT to MTBF may be expressed as: MTBF = 1,000,000,000 x 1/FIT. Additivity Under certain engineering assumptions (e.g. besides the above assumptions for a constant failure rate, the assumption that the considered system has no relevant redundancies), the failure rate for a complex system is simply the sum of the individual failure rates of its components, as long as the units are consistent, e.g. failures per million hours. This permits testing of individual components or subsystems, whose failure rates are then added to obtain the total system failure rate. \\"Reliability Basics\\". 2010\\\\. Vita Faraci. \\"Calculating Failure Rates of Series/Parallel Networks\\". 2006\\\\. Adding \\"redundant\\" components to eliminate a single point of failure improves the mission failure rate, but makes the series failure rate (also called the logistics failure rate) worse—the extra components improve the mean time between critical failures (MTBCF), even though the mean time before something fails is worse. \\"Mission Reliability and Logistics Reliability: A Design Paradox\\". Example Suppose it is desired to estimate the failure rate of a certain component. A test can be performed to estimate its failure rate. Ten identical components are each tested until they either fail or reach 1000 hours, at which time the test is terminated for that component. (The level of statistical confidence is not considered in this example.) The results are as follows: Estimated failure rate is : \\\\frac{6\\\\text{ failures}}{7502\\\\text{ hours}} = 0.0007998\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\text{failures}}{\\\\text{hour}} = 799.8 \\\\times 10^{-6}\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\text{failures}}{\\\\text{hour}}, or 799.8 failures for every million hours of operation.

She was educated at St. Gabriel's NS, Cowper Street and St. Joseph Sisters of Charity Secondary School, Stanhope Street and University College Dublin (UCD), where she graduated with a degree in commerce. She is also a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. She has worked as a lecturer in Accountancy in the Dublin Institute of Technology and the University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Political career=Early years: 1989–1997 Burton first stood for election at the 1989 general election, as one of two Labour Party candidates in the Dublin Central constituency; she failed to be elected. At the local elections in 1991, she was elected to Dublin County Council for the Mulhuddart local electoral area. Burton was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1992 general election as a Labour Party TD for the Dublin West constituency in the 27th Dáil. She was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare in the Fianna Fáil–Labour Party coalition that was formed after that election. With the breakdown of that coalition and the establishment of a Rainbow Coalition of Fine Gael-Labour-Democratic Left in early 1995, she became Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, a position she held until the coalition's defeat at the 1997 general election. Loss of seat and re- election: 1997–2007 She lost her seat at the 1997 general election, to Joe Higgins of the Socialist Party. Burton was re-elected to Fingal County Council in the 1999 local elections, on this occasion winning a seat in the Castleknock local electoral area. She was re-elected to the Dáil for Dublin West at the 2002 general election. She was then appointed Labour Party Spokesperson for Finance. She was a candidate for the deputy leadership of the party in 2002, obtaining 24% of the first preference vote, but was unsuccessful. Labour Deputy Leadership: 2007–2014 Burton became deputy leader of the Labour Party in September 2007. She was re-elected to represent Dublin West at the 2011 general election, topping the poll on the 1st count with 9,627 votes, and was the first TD in the country to be elected to the 31st Dáil. Labour Leadership: 2014–2016 Labour polled badly at the 2014 local and European elections; this led to the resignation of Eamon Gilmore as leader. Burton announced her candidacy for the leadership to replace him. On 4 July 2014, she won the leadership election, defeating Alex White by 78% to 22%. Taoiseach Enda Kenny, appointed her as Tánaiste on the same day. Upon her election she said that the Labour Party \\"would focus on social repair, and govern more with the heart\\". She became the first woman to lead the Labour Party. On 11 July 2014, Burton announced the Labour Party cabinet ministers, with party deputy leader Alan Kelly appointed as Minister for the Environment, Alex White as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Jan O'Sullivan as Minister for Education and Skills and Gerald Nash as Minister of State for Business and Employment and Brendan Howlin remaining as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Burton also remained in her ministry at the Department of Social Protection. Despite a Millward Browne poll that predicted she would lose her constituency seat a month prior to the 2016 general election, Burton polled better than expected and retained her Dublin West seat. At the Women in Media conference that took place in April 2016, following elections and during negotiations to form a governing coalition, Burton discussed how women were excluded from the government negotiation process. She criticized what she called the misogyny and abuse female politicians faced during the election, and as well as the \\"vulgar, crude, and demeaning\\" Late Late Show broadcast during the election that offered Freudian interpretations of politicians' body language.Burton: ‘disproportionate maleness’ in govt talks‘disproportionate maleness’ in govt talks The Irish Times, 16 April 2016 The Labour Party returned to opposition following the 2016 general election, in greatly reduced numbers.

On 6 May 2016, Enda Kenny announced in the Dáil that Frances Fitzgerald would be the new Tánaiste, while Burton's constituency colleague Leo Varadkar took her old job in the Department of Social Protection. On 10 May 2016, she announced her resignation as Labour Party leader, which took effect on 20 May 2016, when her replacement Brendan Howlin was chosen unopposed.

Early life Hamley was the youngest son of Vice-Admiral William Hamley, born at Bodmin, Cornwall, and entered the Royal Artillery in 1843. Career Hamley was promoted captain in 1850, and in 1851 went to Gibraltar, where he began his literary career by contributing articles to magazines. He served throughout the Crimean campaign as aide-de- camp to Sir Richard Dacres, commanding the artillery, taking part in all the operations with distinction, and becoming successively major and lieutenant- colonel by brevet. He also received the CB and French and Turkish orders. During the war Hamley contributed to Blackwood's Magazine an admirable account of the progress of the campaign, which was afterwards republished. The combination in Hamley of literary and military ability secured for him in 1859 the professorship of military history at the new Staff College at Sandhurst, from which in 1866 he went to the council of military education, returning in 1870 to the Staff College as commandant. From 1879 to 1881 Hamley was British commissioner successively for the delimitation of the frontiers of the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria, Ottoman Empire in Asia and the Russian Empire, and Ottoman Empire and Greece, and was rewarded with the KCMG. Promoted colonel in 1863, he became a lieutenant-general in 1882, when he commanded the 2nd division of the expedition to Egypt under Lord Wolseley, and led his troops in the Battle of Tel el-Kebir, for which he received the KCB, the thanks of Parliament, and 2nd class of the Order of Osminieh. Hamley considered that his services in Egypt had been insufficiently recognised in Lord Wolseley's despatches, and expressed his indignation freely, but he had no sufficient ground for supposing that there was any intention to belittle his services. Later life From 1885 until 1892, Hamley was Member of Parliament for Birkenhead in parliament in the Conservative interest. He was promoted to general in 1890. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 2nd Middlesex Artillery Volunteers on 6 November 1887.Monthly Army List 1887–1893. Hamley is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.Brompton Cemetery Writings Hamley was a clever and versatile writer. His principal work, The Operations of War, published in 1866, became a text-book of military instruction. It was praised by the German General Helmuth von Moltke, Chief of the Prussian General Staff, and until 1894 it was the sole text used in the entrance examination for the Camberley Staff College. He also published some pamphlets on national defence, was a frequent contributor to magazines, and the author of several novels, of which perhaps the best known is Lady Lee's Widowhood. Hamley took interest in animal welfare.Handley, Graham. (1996). The Two Georges and The Gunner. The George Eliot Review 272: 56–60. He authored Our Poor Relations, in 1872. The book reflected his compassion for animals and his horror of their abuse. He attacked vivisection and condemned the collecting of moths.

Panzergrenadier (), abbreviated as PzGren (modern) or PzG (WWII), is a German term for motorised or mechanized infantry – that is, infantry transported in combat vehicles specialized for such tasks – as introduced during World War II. It is used in the armies of Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Additionally, in the German Army, Panzergrenadier (Pzg) is also the lowest rank of enlisted men (Mannschaften) in the Panzergrenadiertruppe, comparable to NATO Other Rank-1 level. Forerunners The term Panzergrenadier was not adopted until 1942. Infantry in panzer divisions from 1937 onwards were known as Schützen Regiments; they wore the same rose pink piping on their uniforms as the tank crews (with an \\"S\\" cypher that distinguished the Schützen from the tank and anti-tank units that also wore that colour). Soldiers in special Motorized Infantry units wore the standard white piping of the Infantry. In 1942, when Infantry Regiments were renamed as Grenadier Regiments by Hitler as a historical homage to Frederick the Great's Army, the Schützen regiments (and the soldiers in them) began to be redesignated as Panzergrenadier regiments, as did Motorized Infantry units and soldiers. Their Waffenfarbe was also changed from either white (in the case of Motorized Infantry) or rose pink to a meadow-green shade previously worn by motorcycle troops. Some units did not change over their designations and/or Waffenfarbe accoutrements until 1943, and many veteran Schützen ignored regulations and kept their rose-pink until the end of the war. World War II usage German panzergrenadiers and their Sd.Kfz. 251 armoured half-track in the Soviet Union, August 1942. The term Panzergrenadier had been introduced in 1942, and was applied equally to the infantry component of Panzer divisions as well as the new divisions known as Panzergrenadier Divisions. Most of the Heer's PzGren. divisions evolved via upgrades from ordinary infantry divisions, first to Motorized Infantry divisions and then to PzGren. divisions, retaining their numerical designation within the series for infantry divisions throughout the process. This included the 3rd, 10th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 18th, 20th, 25th, and 29th divisions. Others, such as the Großdeutschland Division, were built up over the course of the war by repeatedly augmenting the size of an elite regiment or battalion. The Waffen-SS also created several PzGren. divisions by the same methods, or by creating new divisions from scratch later in the war. A number of PzGren. divisions in both the Heer and Waffen-SS were upgraded to Panzer divisions as the war progressed. The Panzergrenadier divisions were organized as combined arms formations, usually with six battalions of truck-mounted infantry organized into either two or three regiments, a battalion of tanks, and an ordinary division's complement of artillery, reconnaissance units, combat engineers, anti-tank and anti-aircraft artillery, and so forth. All these support elements would also be mechanized in a PzGren. division, though most of the artillery, anti-tank, and anti-aircraft elements were equipped with weapons towed by trucks rather than the relatively rare armored and self- propelled models. In practice the PzGren. divisions were often equipped with heavy assault guns rather than tanks, one armoured regiment with three battalions of 14 assault guns each one of themLa Guerre des Blindes, Eddy Bayer, Athens, 1964 due to a chronic shortage of tanks throughout the German armed forces. A few elite units, on the other hand, might have the tanks plus a battalion of heavy assault guns for their anti-tank element, and armored carriers for some of their infantry battalions as well. On paper a Panzergrenadier division had one tank battalion less than a Panzer division, but two more infantry battalions, and thus was almost as strong as a Panzer division, especially on the defensive. Of 226 panzergrenadier battalions in the whole of the German Army, Luftwaffe and Waffen SS in September 1943, only 26 were equipped with armoured half tracks, or just over 11 percent. The rest were equipped with trucks.Panzergrenadier Divisions 1939–45 by Chris Bishop. London: Amber Books Ltd, 2007.

The vast majority of Schützen/Panzergrenadier soldiers were mounted in trucks. Additionally, vehicles in the early war period suffered from poor off-road performance. In 1944 a couple of Panzer Divisions based in France had more than the standard one battalion mounted in Sd.Kfz. 251 troop carriers. The Panzer Lehr Division's infantry and engineers were entirely mounted in Sd.Kfz. 251 troop carriers, while the 1st Battalion in both Panzergrenadier regiments in 2. Panzer Division and 21. Panzer Division were half-equipped with armoured halftracks (Sd.Kfz. 251 troop carriers for 2. Panzer, U304(f) light armoured personnel carriers for 21. Panzer).

Five Swiss SPz2000 (Combat Vehicle 90) at Frauenfeld Training Area, 2016 Additionally, in 2008 two inactive Panzergrenadier Battalions were formed: *Panzergrenadierbataillon 908, Viereck (with Panzergrenadierbataillon 411 as supplying and maintaining unit) *Panzergrenadierbataillon 909, Marienberg (with Panzergrenadierbataillon 371 as supplying and maintaining unit) Training and development of the Panzergrenadiertruppe is usually performed by the Armoured Corps Training Centre (Ausbildungszentrum Panzertruppen) in Munster, its commander holding the title of General der Panzertruppen. Some essential training courses, especially for urban warfare and fighting in forested terrain, are held at the Ausbildungszentrum Infanterie (\\"Infantry Training Centre\\") at Hammelburg. OperatorsAustria= The two existing Panzergrenadier battalions of the Austrian Bundesheer use the Ulan armoured fighting vehicle.Panzergrenadiere: Österreichisches Bundesheer The Waffenfarbe of the Austrian Panzergrenadiers is black. =Germany= The main weapon system of the German Panzergrenadiers is the Puma IFV. It was introduced beginning in 2010, with equipping to be completed by 2025. Due to the design of the Puma, Panzergrenadiers cannot exceed a height of 1.84 meters. The G36 assault rifle is the standard weapon of German infantrymen and also used by Panzergrenadier units. Each dismounted fireteam usually also deploys a MG3 machine gun. To fight armored vehicles or other hard targets the Panzerfaust 3 rocket- propelled grenade and the MILAN Anti-tank guided missile are in use. The MILAN-ATGM is used by dismounted Panzergrenadier fireteams (which consist of six soldiers due to the number of soldiers carried by the Marder and Puma IFVs), as well as attached to the Marder turret to provide the IFV with enhanced anti-armour capabilities. In tandem with the replacement of the Marder by the Puma, the MILAN is similarly being replaced by the Spike-ATGM for mounted and dismounted use. As part of the Future Soldier-program, the German Infanterist der Zukunft-program is also intended to be introduced into Panzergrenadier-units and is already deployed with German soldiers in Afghanistan. =Switzerland= In 2000, the Swiss Army purchased 186 CV 90 infantry fighting vehicles from Hägglunds of Sweden. They are in use with Panzergrenadier troops.

His use of tinted papers and opaque paints in watercolour proved influential. Life Harding was born at Deptford in 1798, the son of a drawing-master who had been a pupil of Paul Sandby. He was taught perspective by his father and had lessons from Samuel Prout. At the age of thirteen he exhibited two drawings of buildings in the style of Prout at the Royal Academy. He was apprenticed to the engraver Charles Pye, but left him after only a year to concentrate on painting watercolours, and when he was 18 he was awarded a silver medal by the Society of Arts. In 1818 he showed with the Society of Painters in Watercolours, (known as the \\"Old Watercolour Society or OWCS from 1831) for first time. He was to contribute to its exhibitions for the rest of his life. He was elected an associate of the society in 1820 and a full member in 1821. In 1843 he took up oil painting, and exhibited many landscapes in that medium at the Royal Academy. In 1847 he resigned his membership of the OWCS , hoping to be elected a member of the academy; but, after nine years without success, he withdrew his candidature, and was re-elected to the OWCS. Elm and Birch From an early on in his career Harding was a successful and popular teacher. When lithography became popular in Britain, he quickly adopted it as a means of reproducing good examples for the use of pupils and students. His first productions were drawing-books, consisting of pencil sketches and studies of trees; they were printed in tints with two stones, allowing the reproduction of more elaborate drawings. His Sketches at Home and Abroad, a series of fifty plates using this method, was published in 1836. In 1841 he published The Park and the Forest, a set of sketches drawn on the stone with a brush instead of the crayon, a technique of his own invention which he called \\"lithotint\\". His other lithographic works included A Series of Subjects from the Works of R. P. Bonington (1829–30); Recollections of India (1847, from drawings by C. S. Hardinge) and Picturesque Selections (1861). In 1830, Harding exhibited a series of Italian views sketched on papers of various colours and textures, the syyle of which was widely imitated. His use of opaque body colourin watercolour, following the example set by J.M.W. Turner also proved influential. His drawings were praised by John Ruskin in Modern Painters. From the 1830s a range of papers was produced under the name of \\"JDH pure drawing paper\\", initially for Winsor and Newton. The papers, which proved popular amongst both amateur and professional artists, and which Harding used himself, were produced in white, and in shades of cream, buff and grey. They were marketed until around 1910. Winsor and Newton also produced pencils under Harding's name. In Barnham Marshes Harding was a prolific author of educational manuals, and his Lessons on Art, Guide and Companion to Lessons on Art, Elementary Art, or the Use of the Chalk and Lead Pencil advocated and explained, and The Principles and Practice of Art, were widely used both in Britain and abroad. His Drawing Models and Their Uses (1854) describes the use of a range of solid forms which he prepared and marketed. He was described by Gilbert Redgrave in A History of Water Colour Painting in England as \\"a skilful and rapid draughtsman, though somewhat mannered, and rarely rising above the commonplace.\\" He died at Barnes, on 4 December 1863, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery.

Hip hop tuga is different from mainstream hip hop because it has strong influences from African music, from Lusophone Africa, reggae, zouk and fado. Artists such as Valete and Sam the Kid are among the most popular. Old school Portuguese hip hop artists include General D, Chullage, Boss AC, Mind Da Gap, Dealema, Fuse, Mundo Segundo, Regula, Da Weasel, Allen Halloween, J.Cap, Sir Scratch, Don Nuno, and Guetto 6 Damaia. General D the godfather of Portuguese hip hop in Lisbon, Portugal 1993. Lisbon-based Cape Verdean Portuguese rapper Boss AC during a live performance in 1994. The founder of hip hop tuga was rapper General D. Born in Maputo, Mozambique, General D moved to Lisbon at a young age and, even though he held a Portuguese passport and was heavily influenced by American rap, he always merged his music with his own Mozambican roots. He was the first rap-oriented artist of any kind to have a legitimate recording contract in Portugal. In 1994, he signed with Valentim de Carvalho, a Portuguese division of EMI Records, with whom he recorded two albums: Pé Na Tchôn, Karapinha Na Céu (1995) and Kanimabo (1997). Intelligent and charismatic, the general public and media liked General D., even though his lyrics were often very anti- establishment.https://www.discogs.com/artist/222370-General- Dhttps://www.publico.pt/2014/03/14/culturaipsilon/noticia/general-d-uma- historia-nunca- contada-331877https://theculturetrip.com/europe/portugal/articles/hip-hop- tuga-the-history-of-portuguese-hip-hop-pt-1/ Californian hip hop artist and poet, Ithaka (also known as: Ithaka Darin Pappas) is often included in the hip hop tuga community because he lived and recorded in Lisbon during 1992-1998 and was among the first wave of artists working with hip hop in Portugal. There he completed his first two (of eight) albums; Flowers And The Color Of Paint (1995) and Stellafly (1997). His 1995 song \\"Escape from the City of Angels\\" (featuring Lisbon's Marta Dias) was included in the soundtrack of Antoine Fuqua's U.S. feature film directorial debut The Replacement Killers (Columbia Pictures) starring Chow Yun Fat, Mira Sorvino, Clifton Collins Jr. and Michael Rooker.

This ancient surname of many spellings, is a \\"crusader\\" import into Europe from the Holy Land. Recorded as Elliss, Elix, Ellice, Eles, Elias, Heelis, and many other forms, it derives from the Greek \\"Elias\\", itself from the Hebrew \\"Eliyahu\\", and meaning \\"Yahweh is God\\". It also carries the Tigrinyan derivation from 'Ellos' as well as the Greek 'Helios', themselves both meaning 'sun god'.

It was the first title in the main Final Fantasy series in which Uematsu was not the sole composer. The Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack was released on four Compact Discs in 2001 by DigiCube, and was re-released in 2004 by Square Enix. Prior to the album's North American release, a reduced version entitled Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack was released on a single disk by Tokyopop in 2002. An EP entitled feel/Go dream: Yuna & Tidus containing additional singles not present in the game was released by DigiCube in 2001. Piano Collections Final Fantasy X, a collection of piano arrangements of the original soundtracks by Masashi Hamauzu and performed by Aki Kuroda, was released by DigiCube in 2002 and re-released by Square EA in 2004. A collection of vocal arrangements of pieces from the game arranged by Katsumi Suyama along with radio drama tracks was released as Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection in 2002 by DigiCube. The theme song for the game is titled \\"Suteki da ne\\", which was performed by Japanese folk singer Ritsuki Nakano, known as \\"RIKKI\\". The song was released as a single by DigiCube in 2001 and was re-released by Square Enix in 2004. The game's music was well received overall; reviewers praised the additions to the soundtrack by the two new composers for the series. They especially praised Hamauzu, both for his work in the original soundtrack and in arranging the themes for Piano Collections Final Fantasy X. Several tracks, especially \\"Suteki da ne\\" and \\"To Zanarkand\\", remain popular today, and have been performed numerous times in orchestral concert series, as well as being published in arranged and compilation albums by Square as well as outside groups. Creation and influence Final Fantasy X marks the first time Nobuo Uematsu has had any assistance in composing the score for a Final Fantasy game. His fellow composers for Final Fantasy X were Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano. Uematsu contributed 51 tracks, Hamauzu contributed 20 tracks and Nakano contributed 18 tracks to the game. The two new composers were chosen for the soundtrack based on their ability to create music that was different than Uematsu's while still working together. Uematsu states that his music has been inspired by the music of popstar idols such as Elton John and Paul McCartney, and that his favorite part about the soundtrack is the good reviews from listeners. Nakano set out to create music with a \\"vibrant and dynamic feel\\" that tied together his years of experience with game music, while Hamauzu tried to use the soundtrack to bring video game music to \\"greater heights\\". \\"To Zanarkand\\" was originally written by Uematsu before the development of Final Fantasy X, for the recital of a flutist friend named Seo. Uematsu eventually decided the track was too gloomy and kept it for a later use. When development of Final Fantasy X started, he decided to use the track for the game. Albums=Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack is a soundtrack album of music from Final Fantasy X composed, arranged and produced by Nobuo Uematsu, Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano. Vocals are performed by RIKKI for \\"Suteki da ne\\", Bill Muir for \\"Otherworld\\", and choruses for \\"Hymn of the Fayth\\". It spans four discs and 91 tracks, covering a duration of 4:32:26. It was first released in Japan on August 1, 2001 by DigiCube with catalog number SSCX-10054, and was re-released on May 10, 2004 by Square Enix with catalog number SQEX-10013. In 2002, Tokyopop released a version of Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack in North America entitled Final Fantasy X Official Soundtrack, which contained 17 tracks from the original album on a single disk. This release had the catalog number TPCD-0211-2. Additionally, in 2001, prior to the game's release, Square released a promotional disk titled Final Fantasy X Promo CD, which contained edited versions of \\"Other World\\", \\"Zanarkand\\", and \\"Battle 1\\". The disk covers a length of 7:08, and was only released in Japan. Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack reached #4 on the Oricon charts, and sold 140,000 copies as of January 2010. The album was moderately well received; while some reviewers felt it to be an \\"absolutely amazing\\" soundtrack, others only found it to be a \\"satisfying\\" work that was \\"not quite all I was hoping for\\". Some reviewers felt that of the three composers, Uematsu's pieces were the weakest, citing them as having a tendency to be \\"buried\\" under the compositions of the others. The same reviewers, however, noted that some of the best pieces on the soundtrack, such as \\"To Zanarkand\\", were the work of Uematsu. Hamauzu's contributions were seen as some of his best work, and reviewers felt that both he and Nakano brought a \\"myriad of new flavors\\" to the soundtrack which were very well received. Final Fantasy X Official Soundtrack, although not re-released after the Original Soundtrack was brought to North America, was seen as a good sampler of the music from the full soundtrack. Track listing feel/Go dream: Yuna & Tidus feel/Go dream: Yuna & Tidus is an EP containing tracks composed by Nobuo Uematsu and inspired by pieces from the game. \\"feel\\" was based on the \\"Hymn of the Fayth,\\" while \\"Go dream\\" was based on \\"Tidus' Theme\\". Music arrangements were done by Masashi Hamauzu, Tsuyoshi Sekito, and Masayoshi Soken (under the pseudonym \\"Masayoshi Kikuchi\\"). Vocals are performed by Mayuko Aoki for the track \\"feel\\" and Masakazu Morita for the track \\"Go dream\\". A remix of \\"feel\\" was included as a bonus track in the Vocal Collection of Final Fantasy X. It was released in Japan by DigiCube on October 11, 2001, bearing the catalog number SSCX-10058. The EP reached #13 on the Oricon charts. Piano Collections Final Fantasy X Piano Collections Final Fantasy X is a collection of music from the original soundtrack arranged for the piano by Masashi Hamauzu, and performed by Aki Kuroda. Hamauzu intended the process of arranging the pieces to \\"consider the groundwork of individual compositions in order to transform these pieces into piano arrangements\\" rather than simply playing the themes on a piano as they originally sounded. It spans 15 tracks and covers a duration of 56:43. It was first released in Japan on February 20, 2002 by DigiCube with catalog number SSCX-10064, and was re-released on July 22, 2004 by Square Enix with catalog number SQEX-10028. Piano Collections Final Fantasy X reached #89 on the Oricon charts and sold 2,900 copies. It was very well received, with reviewers finding it to be a \\"great\\" album, and stating that it was superior to most video game soundtracks, both piano or otherwise. They especially praised Hamauzu, terming him a \\"very skilled arranger and performer\\". Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection is a collection of vocal arrangements of pieces from the game arranged by Katsumi Suyama along with radio drama tracks, performed by the game's characters' voice actors in Japanese. It spans 14 tracks and covers a duration of 42:21. It was released in Japan on December 18, 2002 by DigiCube with catalog number SSCX-10073. The album was poorly received by critics. They found the album, while it had \\"pretty good\\" vocals, to have overall poor sound quality and a clichéd musical style. While \\"not a horrible album\\", they found that the collection was overpriced and under-produced. It reached #69 on the Oricon charts, and sold over 11,700 copies. Suteki da ne \\"Suteki da ne\\" is the theme song of Final Fantasy X. It was written by Nobuo Uematsu and Kazushige Nojima and was sung by Japanese folk singer Ritsuki Nakano, known as \\"Rikki\\", whom the music team contacted while searching for a singer whose music reflected an Okinawan atmosphere. \\"Suteki da ne\\" is sung in its original Japanese form in both the Japanese and English versions of Final Fantasy X. The song's title translates to \\"Isn't It Wonderful?\\" in English, and its lyrics were written by scenario writer Kazushige Nojima, while Uematsu composed the instrumentals and Shirō Hamaguchi arranged the instrumentals. Like the ballad from Final Fantasy VIII, \\"Suteki da ne\\" has an in-game version used in cutscenes together with an orchestrated version used as part of the ending theme. The song was released as a single by DigiCube on July 18, 2001, and re-released by Square Enix on July 22, 2004. The disk also contains an instrumental version, an unrelated song entitled \\"Gotsuki-sama ~UTIKISAMA~\\" (\\"The Moon\\"), and a vocal version of Aerith's theme song from Final Fantasy VII titled \\"Pure Heart\\". The single covers a duration of 20:35. The original release has a catalog number of SSCX-10053, and the re-release has a catalog number of SQEX-10029. The original release of \\"Suteki da ne\\" reached #10 on the Oricon charts, and sold 130,000 copies. There is also an \\"autumn version\\" of the song, also performed by Ritsuki Nakano, released by Universal on October 3, 2001 on the \\"KANARIA\\" minialbum together with six unrelated tracks. The release has a catalog number of UMCK-1056. This version of the song, as well as all versions on the single, is also found on the Final Fantasy Single Collection bootleg CD, released by EverAnime with catalog number GM-496, by Archer Records with catalog number SA-007 and by Miya Records with catalog number MICA-0068. An official English translation of the song was created for the Distant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy concert series and was first performed in Chicago by vocalist Susan Calloway on December 12, 2009. Otherworld \\"Otherworld\\", the opening theme of Final Fantasy X, was composed by Nobuo Uematsu with lyrics by Alexander O. Smith. It was sung by Bill Muir, the frontman of xtillidiex (pronounced \\"Till I die\\"), a death metal band active in Tokyo at the time. The song was already fully formed when Smith was tasked with writing lyrics for it based on a guide track. Smith's lyrics were loosely based on \\"The Song of Wandering Aengus\\", a poem by W. B. Yeats. Smith mistook a guitar solo section of the song as another part that he had to fill with lyrics, and so he wrote in a spoken words part in \\"one of those Limp Bizkit-style breakdowns\\". Uematsu liked the result and included it in the final song.http://www.rpgsite.net/interview/3030-alexander-o-smith-interview Legacy The Black Mages, a band led by Nobuo Uematsu that arranges music from Final Fantasy video games into a rock music style, have arranged three pieces from Final Fantasy X. These are \\"Fight With Seymour\\" from their self- titled album, published in 2003, and \\"Otherworld\\" and \\"The Skies Above\\", both of which can be found on the album The Skies Above, published in 2004. Uematsu continues to perform certain pieces in his Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy concert series. The music of Final Fantasy X has also appeared in various official concerts and live albums, such as 20020220 Music from Final Fantasy, a live recording of an orchestra performing music from the series including several pieces from the game. Additionally, \\"Swing de Chocobo\\" was performed by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra for the Distant Worlds - Music from Final Fantasy concert tour, while \\"Zanarkand\\" was performed by the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra in the Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy concert series. An arrangement of \\"A Fleeting Dream\\" was performed on July 9, 2011 at the Symphonic Odysseys concert, which commemorated the music of Uematsu. Independent but officially licensed releases of Final Fantasy X music have been composed by such groups as Project Majestic Mix, which focuses on arranging video game music. Selections also appear on Japanese remix albums, called dojin music, and on English remixing websites.

He played a vital role in the Insurrection of 31 May - 2 June 1793 and subsequently the fall of the Girondins. On 27 July 1794 he tried to release Maximilien Robespierre, who was arrested by the Convention. He was executed on the next day - together with Robespierre, Saint-Just and Couthon - by the rules of the law of 22 Prairial, only verifying his identity at the trial. Life=Early years François Hanriot was born in Nanterre, nowadays a western suburb of Paris. His parents were servants (gardeners) to a former Treasurer of France. and came from Sormery in the Bourgogne. Between 1779 and 1783 he seems to have been a soldier in America serving under Lafayette (but there are no documents to prove that).Moreau, J. (2010) François Hanriot, general-citizen, p. 32-34. Nanterre: Société d'Histoire de Nanterre. Not a man of any specific profession, Hanriot held a variety of different jobs. He took his first employment with a procureur doing mostly secretarial work, but lost his position due to reasons of dishonesty. Next, he obtained a clerkship in the Paris octroi in 1789 doing tax work. His position here was also ill-fated, as he was again fired after leaving his station the night of 12 July 1789, when the popular Jacques Necker was fired and angry Parisians attempted to burn the building belonging to the Wall of the Ferme générale down. Hanriot was arrested and imprisoned in Bicêtre, and released the next year with the help of Jean-Paul Marat.Moreau, J. (2010) François Hanriot, general-citizen, p. 32-34. Nanterre: Société d'Histoire de Nanterre. After his string of unfortunate professions, Hanriot remained unemployed and subsequently very poor. His next string of occupations is rather hazy in history; many people of the time connect him to a variety of professions including a shopkeeper, selling liquor and a peddler. He owned the complete works by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, published by Pierre-Alexandre DuPeyrou and René Louis de Girardin (1780-1782). Role in the first years of the Revolution After generating a more substantial fortune and moving to 21, Rue de la Clef, in a Parisian quarter near Jardin des Plantes and Rue Mouffetard, in January 1792, Hanriot soon became well known for his anti-aristocratic outlook and attacking LaFayette. He became an orator for the local section \\"Sans-culottes\\", one of the most populous and poorest districts of the capital. On 9 August 1792, when the Assembly refused to impeach LaFayette, the tocsin called the sections into arms.N. Hampson (1978) Danton, p. 72 In the evening the \\"commissionaires\\" of several sections (Billaud-Varenne, Chaumette, Hébert, Hanriot, Fleuriot- Lescot, Pache, Bourdon) gathered in the town hall. The next day the Tuileries was stormed by the National Guard, the Fédérés and the people from the revolutionary sections of Paris. As a member of the Cordeliers club he was strongly in favor of imposing taxes on the aristocracy, presenting them \\"with a bill in one hand and a pistol in the other.\\" With this attitude he gained a loyal following of local sans-culottes and they would appoint him on 2 September as captain of the National Guard battalion of his section. It is unlikely he participated in the September Massacre as the Sainte-Pélagie Prison in his section was not visited at all. On 18 September he was elected as one of the 24 Paris deputies in the Convention. The Fall of the Girondists Journées des 31 Mai, 1er et 2 Juin 1793, an engraving of the Convention surrounded by National Guards, forcing the deputies to arrest the Girondins and to establish an armed force of 6,000 men. The insurrection was organized by the Paris Commune and supported by Montagnards. The uprising of the Parisian sans-culottes from 31 May to 2 June 1793. The scene takes place in front of the Deputies Chamber in the Tuileries. The depiction shows Marie- Jean Hérault de Séchelles and Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud. The Spring of 1793 was a period of great political tension in Paris as the radical voices in the Commune and the Montagnards in the Convention became more overtly hostile to the ruling Girondist faction. The authorities' decision to arrest Jean-Paul Marat in April brought matters to a head, and precipitated the Fall of the Girondists in which Hanriot played a major part. In the evening of 30 May 1793 the Commune appointed Hanriot provisionally to the position of \\"Commandant- General\\" of the Parisian National Guard, because Santerre was fighting in the Vendée. He was ordered to march his troops to the Palais National. The purpose of this move was to force the Convention to dissolve the Commission of Twelve and the arrest of 22 select Girondists. In the morning of Friday 31 May the city gates were closed and the tocsin in the Notre-Dame was rung. Hanriot ordered to fire a cannon on the Pont-Neuf as a sign of alarm.Thompson, J.M. (1959) The French Revolution. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, p. 353. Vergniaud suggested to arrest Hanriot. On the night of June 1 the Comité insurrectionnel ordered the arrest of Jean-Marie Roland and Clavière and banning the Girondist newspapers and the arrest of their editors.Mathiez, Albert (1995) The French Revolution, p. 325. Rostov-on-Don: Phoenix. It ordered François Hanriot, to surround the Convention ‘with a respectable armed force’.Davidson, Ian. The French Revolution, p. 161 The Convention (about 100 deputies) decided to allow men to carry arms on days of crisis and pay them for each day and promised to indemnify the workers for the interruption in the past four days. It postponed any other decisions on the accused deputies for three days.Gazette nationale ou le Moniteur universel, 5 juin 1793 (At midnight the commune decided the men should take a rest and go home.) The next morning the Convention invited Hanriot, who told them all the men were prepared and posts occupied. Some people on the galleries called \\"A la Vendée\\". Hanriot ordered National Guard to march from the town hall to the National Palace. In the early evening on 2 June, a large force of armed citizens, some estimated 80,000, but Danton spoke of 30,000 souls,Le Républicain français, 14 septembre 1793, p. 2Moreau, J. (2010) François Hanriot, general-citizen, p. ?. Nanterre: Société d'Histoire de Nanterre. surrounded the convention with artillery. \\"The armed force\\", Hanriot said, \\"will retire only when the Convention has delivered to the people the deputies denounced by the Commune.\\" The accused Girondins attempted to exit, walked around the palace in a theatrical procession and confronted on all sides by bayonets and pikes, returned to the meeting hall and submitted to the inevitable. Twenty-two Girondins were seized one by one after some juggling with names. They finally decided that 31 deputies were not to be imprisoned, but only subject to house arrest.Davidson, Ian. The French Revolution, p. 161-162 On 2 June 1793 at 11 in the morning women gathered in front of the Convention. Then Hanriot's troops surrounded the Convention with thousands of armed volunteers, cannons and pikes while it was in session and throngs of sans-culotte soldiers entered the building and disrupted the sessions. The President of the Convention, Herault de Sechelles, came out to appeal to Hanriot to remove his troops, but he refused. Under that pressure, the Convention voted the arrest of 22 Girondist deputies, removing that faction from power. Marat and Couthon regarded Hanriot as the “Savior of the Fatherland”. (Gérard Walter insists on the contrary on the perfect discipline of the men commanded by Hanriot. The historian thus attributes to the sans- culotte commander the merit of having avoided the bloodshed during the exclusion and the arrest of the Girondins deputies.) On 11 June Hanriot resigned his command, declaring that order had been restored. On 29 June he was reelected in his section.Moreau, J. (2010) François Hanriot, general- citizen, p. 32-34. Nanterre: Société d'Histoire de Nanterre. On 1 July he was elected by the Commune and two days later appointed by Jean Bouchotte permanent commander of the armed forces of Paris. On 4 September, the Sans- culottes again invaded the convention. Supported by Hanriot they demanded tougher measures against rising prices and the setting up of a system of terror to root out the counter-revolution. On 11 September the power of the Comité de Salut Public was extended for one month; Robespierre supported Hanriot in the Jacobin club who led the insurrection in 2 June. On 19 September the Convention supported his appointment as general of the Parisian National Guard. Hanriot moved into an apartment on the third floor of the Hôtel de Ville, Paris.Gustave Hue (1907) Deux géneraux de la République. In: Les Contemporains, 1 janvier 1907 On 8 December he declared not to use arms against the people; he would use reason. End of the Reign of Terror Saint-Just and Robespierre at the Hôtel de Ville on the night of 9 to 10 Thermidor Year II. Painting by Jean-Joseph Weerts During the Spring of 1794 there were increasing tensions between Robespierre and the Committees on the one hand, and the Paris Commune and the sans-culottes on the other. On 6 March Hanriot appeared in front of the Convention with 1,200 men. This culminated in the arrest of Hebert, Momoro, Vincent, Ronsin and their associates on 13 March. Hanriot, a Hébertist, was protected by Robespierre. On 27 March the sans-culotte Revolutionary Army was disbanded and its artillery units brought under Hanriot's control. Although he was broadly supportive of the radical ideas of Hébert and his associates, Hanriot remained loyal to Robespierre. At around 3 p.m. Hanriot was ordered to appear in the convention; he or someone else suggested to only show up accompanied by a crowd. (Dumas was already arrested at noon and at four taken to Sainte-Pélagie Prison, as well as members of the family Duplay.Ratineau Fabienne. Les livres de Robespierre au 9 thermidor.

La Garde nationale (Folio Histoire) (French Edition). Editions Gallimard. What had happened was not very clear to their officers; either the convention was closed down or the Paris Commune. Nobody explained anything. When the Paris Commune heard of the arrests it began mobilising forces to free Robespierre and his allies and to take control of the Convention. The mayor Fleuriot-Lescot instructed the prisons of Paris to refuse admission to any prisoners sent to them by the Convention and Hanriot took charge of military preparations for taking the Convention. When he appeared at the Place du Carrousel in front of the Convention he was taken prisoner by the oldest deputy Philippe Rühl. (He seems to be taken prisoner earlier that day by :fr:Louis Antoine Joseph Robin near the Palais-Royal. To avoid communication with Hanriot the five deputies were given a meal and it was decided they had to leave the Tuileries?] According to Eric Hazan: \\"Now came the turning-point of this journée: instead of taking advantage of its superiority, in both guns and men, to invade the nearby hall where the Convention was sitting, the column, lacking orders or leaders, returned to the Maison-Commune.\\" After 9 p.m. the vice-president of the Tribunal Coffinhal went to Committee of General Security with 3,000 men and their artillery.Fouche & Robespierre, le 9 thermidor by Arnaud Louis Raoul Comte de Martel, p. 238-239 As Robespierre and his allies had been taken to a prison in the meantime he succeeded only in freeing Hanriot and his adjutants.Richard T. Bienvenu (1968) The Ninth of Thermidor, p. 235 The Convention declared the five deputies (plus the supporting members) to be outlaws. On hearing this, the insurgents and their commander were seized with fright and fled helter- skelter to the Commune.Richard T. Bienvenu (1968) The Ninth of Thermidor, p. 215, 224 When the Paris' militants heard this news, order began to break down, they became divided. Hanriot ordered the armed forces which surrounded the national palace to retire. Or was Hanriot forced by the Commune to withdraw his troops? As Hanriot was given orders, which was illegal, the Convention put him outside the law. Hanriot did not dare to take advantage of the situation and preferred to return to the Town Hall to consult with the general council of the Commune?Dupuy, Roger. La Garde nationale (Folio Histoire) (French Edition). Gallimard editions. Hanriot ordered his armed \\"sectionnaires\\" to withdraw to square in front of the Hôtel de Ville. All or just many of the gunners decided to defend the Convention instead of the Commune and if ordered would turn their pieces in the direction of the town hall.Richard T. Bienvenu (1968) The Ninth of Thermidor, p. 216-217 In the evening Robespierre, Hanriot and the other liberated prisoners had gathered at the Hotel de Ville which was now their headquarters. The Convention responded by declaring them outlaws to be taken dead or alive, and ordering troops of its own under Barras to suppress them. Henriot ordered to light the entire square with torches. Within an hour, the forces of the Commune quietly deserted the square. Around two in the morning, troops of the Convention under the command of Barras arrived. Robespierre and a number of others were arrested. Hanriot fell from a side window, and was found later in the day, unconscious, in a neighbouring courtyard. Hanriot was taken to the guillotine in the same cart as Robespierre and his brother and was executed just before Robespierre on 28 July 1794, only semi-conscious when led to the platform. According to Merda Hanriot tried to escape by a concealed staircase to the third floor.C.A. Méda, p. 385 Most sources say that Hanriot was thrown out of a window by Coffinhal after being accused of the disaster. (According to Ernest Hamel it is one of the many legends spread by Barère.E. Hamel, p. 342) Anyhow, Hanriot landed in a small courtyard on a heap of glass or manure. He had strength enough to crawl into a drain where he was found twelve hours later and taken to the Conciergerie. In the afternoon of 10 Thermidor (28 July, a décadi, a day of rest and festivity) the Revolutionary Tribunal condemned Robespierre and 21 \\"Robespierrists\\" (c.q. 13 members of the insurrectionary Commune) to death by the rules of the law of 22 Prairial, only verifying their identity at the trial. In the late afternoon, the convicts were taken in three carts to the Place de la Révolution to be executed.

This gives his full name as Francis Stanley Jackson, whereas Cricinfo and CricketArchive both give his full name as Frank Stanley Jackson. This article uses the name given by Wisden. (21 November 1870 – 9 March 1947), known as the Honourable Stanley Jackson during his playing career, was an English cricketer, soldier and Conservative Party politician. He played in 20 Test matches for the England cricket team between 1893 and 1905. Early life Jackson was born in Leeds. His father was William Jackson, 1st Baron Allerton. During Stanley's time at Harrow School his fag was fellow parliamentarian and future Prime Minister Winston Churchill. He went up to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1889.  Cricket career  Jackson c. 1895 Jackson played for Cambridge University, Yorkshire and England. He spotted the talent of Ranjitsinhji when the latter, owing to his unorthodox batting and his race, was struggling to find a place for himself in the university side, and as captain was responsible for Ranji's inclusion in the Cambridge First XI and the awarding of his Blue. According to Alan Gibson this was \\"a much more controversial thing to do than would seem possible to us now\\". He was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1894. He captained England in five Test matches in 1905, winning two and drawing three to retain The Ashes.Alan Gibson wrote a book about his achievements in that series, published in 1966: Jackson's Year: The Test Matches Of 1905. Captaining England for the first time, he won all five tosses and topped the batting and bowling averages for both sides, with 492 runs at 70.28 and 13 wickets at 15.46. These were the last of his 20 Test matches, all played at home as he could not spare the time to tour. Jackson still holds the Test record for the most matches in a career without playing away from home.. An orthodox batsman with a penchant for forcing strokes in front of square on both sides of the wicket he was regarded as a very sound player of fast bowling. His own bowling was a brisk fast medium, with a good off cutter his main weapon. While his commitments outside of cricket limited the number of games he played he was a key member of the very strong Yorkshire sides who won 6 county championships during his career (although this did include 1901 when Jackson did not appear in the county championship). His performances in 1896 and 1898 in particular showed what his statistics could have been if he had been able to dedicate more time, scoring over 1,000 championship runs at better than 40.00 in each season and taking over 100 wickets across the two seasons at an average of under 20. He was also the first batsman to be dismissed for nervous 90's on test debut. Gibson wrote of him as a cricketer that he had \\"a toughness of character, a certain ruthlessness behind the genial exterior... He does not seem to have been a particularly popular man, though he was always a deeply respected one.\\" He was President of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1921. Jackson succeeded Lord Hawke as President of Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1938 after Hawke's death and held the post until his own death in 1947.Kilburn, p. 123.  Military and political career  Jackson was a lieutenant in the Harrow Volunteers when he was on 16 January 1900 appointed captain in 3rd (Militia) Battalion of the King's Own (Royal Lancaster Regiment). He left with his battalion in February 1900 to serve in the Second Boer War, and arrived in South Africa the following month. He transferred to the West Yorkshire Regiment as a Lieutenant-Colonel in 1914. He was elected as a Member of Parliament at a by-election in February 1915, representing Howdenshire (Yorkshire) until resigning his seat on 3 November 1926. He served as Financial Secretary to the War Office 1922–23. In 1927 he was appointed Governor of Bengal and in that year was knighted with the GCIE and was made a member of the Privy Council. In 1928 while he was Governor of Bengal, he inaugurated The Malda District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd in Malda District of Bengal to promote co-operative movements. He was awarded the KStJ in 1932. In 1932, he sidestepped and ducked five pistol shots fired at close range by a girl student named Bina Das in the Convocation Hall of the University of Calcutta. Escaping unharmed and smiling, \\"[e]ven before the smoke had blown away, the Governor resumed his speech amid cheers.\\"Five shots fired at governor Glasgow Herald, 8 February 1932, p. 11 The attacker was tackled and disarmed by Lieutenant-Colonel Hassan Suhrawardy (the first Muslim vice chancellor of the University of Calcutta), who was knighted by the King for his heroism.Bravery Recognised Brisbane Courier 18 February 1932, at Trove Later that year, Jackson was appointed GCSI.

The resignation followed severe economic and political crises over the previous six to twelve months. Vice president B. J. Habibie took over the presidency. Dissent under the New Order Coming to power in 1967 on the aftermath of an attempted coup officially blamed on the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), the government of Suharto adopted policies that severely restricted civil liberties and instituted a system of rule that effectively split power between the Golkar organisation and the military. In 1970, price rises and corruption prompted student protests and an investigation by a government commission. Suharto responded by banning student protest, forcing the activists underground. Only token prosecution of cases recommended by the commission was pursued. The pattern of co-opting a few of his more powerful opponents while criminalising the rest became a hallmark of Suharto's rule. In order to maintain a veneer of democracy, Suharto made several electoral reforms. He stood for election before electoral college votes every five years, beginning in 1973. According to his electoral rules, however, only three entities were allowed to participate in the election: two political parties and Golkar. All the previously existing political parties were forced to be part of either the Islamist United Development Party (PPP) or the nationalist Democratic Party of Indonesia (PDI). Golkar, being Suharto's primary political vehicle, was officially not a political party. All senior civil servants were obliged to join employee associations linked to Golkar, while senior bureaucrats were banned from joining political parties. In a political compromise with the powerful military, Suharto banned its members from voting in elections but set aside seats in the legislature for their representatives. As a result, he won every election in which he stood in 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998. This authoritarianism became an issue in the 1980s. On 5 May 1980, a group called the Petition of Fifty (Petisi 50) demanded greater political freedoms and accused Suharto of misinterpreting the Pancasila state ideology. It was signed by former military men, politicians, academics and students. The Indonesian media suppressed the news, and the government placed restrictions on the signatories, some of whom were later jailed. Following the end to the Cold War, western concern over communism waned, and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny. In 1991, the murder of East Timorese civilians in a Dili cemetery, also known as the \\"Santa Cruz Massacre\\", caused US attention to focus on its military relations with the Suharto regime and the question of Indonesia's occupation of East Timor. In 1992, this attention resulted in the Congress of the United States passing limitations on IMET assistance to the Indonesian military, over the objections of President George H.W. Bush. In 1993, under President Bill Clinton, the US delegation to the United Nations Human Rights Commission helped pass a resolution expressing deep concern over Indonesian human rights violations in East Timor. Cracks emerge ABC news report of Suharto announcing he would retire in 1998 and speculating on who would replace him—including eventual successor B. J. Habibie. In 1996, the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), a legal party that had been used by the New Order as a benign prop for the New Order's electoral system, began to assert its independence under Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Indonesia's founding father, Sukarno. In response, Suharto attempted to foster a split over the leadership of the PDI, backing a co-opted faction loyal to deputy speaker of Parliament Suryadi against supporters of Megawati. After the Suryadi faction announced a party congress to sack Megawati would be held in Medan on 20–22 June, Megawati proclaimed that her supporters would hold demonstrations in protest. The Suryadi faction went through with the sacking, and the demonstrations manifested themselves throughout Indonesia. Megawati's supporters then took over the PDI headquarters in Jakarta. On Saturday 27 July, a mob including soldiers in civilian clothing and thugs from the army-associated Pemuda Pancasila organisation forcibly entered the building. According to the National Human Rights Commission (Komnas HAM), five people were killed, 149 injured and 74 missing – mostly from those arrested by the military. The attack was followed by two days of rioting, in which youths burned at least six buildings, including that of the Ministry of Agriculture. The political tensions in Jakarta were accompanied by anti-Chinese riots in Situbondo (1996), Tasikmalaya (1996), Banjarmasin (1997), and Makassar (1997); while violent ethnic clashes broke out between the Dayak and Madurese settlers in Central Kalimantan in 1997. After a violent campaign season, Golkar won the rigged May 1997 MPR elections. The new MPR voted unanimously to re-elect Suharto to another five-year term in office in March 1998, upon which he appointed his protégé BJ Habibie as vice-president while stacking the cabinet with his own family and business associates (his daughter Tutut became Minister of Social Affairs). The government's increase of fuel prices by 70% in May triggered rioting in Medan. With Suharto increasingly seen as the source of the country's mounting economic and political crises, prominent political figures, including Muslim politician Amien Rais, spoke out against his presidency, and in January 1998 university students began organising nationwide demonstrations. Monetary crisis Indonesia followed the Kingdom Of Thailand in abandoning the fixed exchange rate of its currency on 14 August 1997. The rupiah further devalued to its lowest point following the signing of the second IMF letter of intent on 15 January 1998. In the second half of 1997, Indonesia became the country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The economy suffered a flight of foreign capital leading to the Indonesian rupiah falling from Rp 2,600 per dollar in August 1997 to over Rp 14,800 per dollar by January 1998. The Indonesian companies with US dollar- denominated borrowings struggled to service these debts with their rupiah earnings, and many went bankrupt. Efforts by Bank Indonesia to defend its managed float regime by selling US dollars had little effect on the currency's decline, but instead drained Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves. Weaknesses in the Indonesian economy, including high levels of debt, inadequate financial management systems and crony capitalism, were identified as underlying causes. Volatility in the global financial system and over-liberalisation of international capital markets were also cited. The government responded by floating the currency, requesting International Monetary Fund assistance, closing some banks and postponing major capital projects. In December 1997, Suharto for the first time did not attend an ASEAN presidents' summit, which was later revealed to be due to a minor stroke, creating speculation about his health and the immediate future of his presidency. In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press conference to assure he was in charge and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing rupiah. Suharto's attempts to re-instil confidence, such as ordering generals to personally reassure shoppers at markets and an \\"I Love the Rupiah\\" campaign, had little effect. Evidence suggested that Suharto's family and associates were being spared the most stringent requirements of the IMF reform process, and there was open conflict between economic technocrats implementing IMF plans and Suharto-related vested interests, further undermining confidence in the economy. The government's unrealistic 1998 budget and Suharto's announcement of Habibie as the next vice president both caused further currency instability. Suharto reluctantly agreed to a wider-reaching IMF package of structural reforms in January 1998 in exchange for $43 billion in liquidity (with a third letter of intent with the IMF being signed in April of that year). However, the rupiah dropped to a sixth of its pre-crisis value, and rumours and panic led to a run on stores and pushed up prices. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits, and set up the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take over management of troubled banks in order to prevent the collapse of the financial system. Based on the IMF recommendations, the government increased interest rates to 70% pa in February 1998 to control high inflation caused by the higher prices of imports. However, this action restricted the availability of credit to the corporate sector. Shops looted and goods burned on the streets in Jakarta, 14 May 1998. In 1997 and 1998, there were riots in various parts of Indonesia. Sometimes these riots were aimed against Chinese Indonesians. Some riots looked spontaneous, and others looked as if they had been planned. One theory was that pro-Suharto generals were trying to weaken the forces of democracy by increasing the divisions between orthodox and non-orthodox Muslims, between Muslims and Christians and between Chinese and non-Chinese. Another theory was that certain generals were trying to topple Suharto. Human Rights Watch Asia reported that in the first five weeks of 1998, there were over two dozen demonstrations, price riots, bomb threats, and bombings on Java and that unrest was spreading to other islands. An Islamic school and four mosques were turned ablaze in retaliation for Church fires by Christians. Trisakti incident At the start of May 1998, students were holding peaceful demonstrations on university campuses across the country. They were protesting against massive price rises for fuel and energy, and they were demanding that President Suharto should step down. On 12 May, as students at Jakarta's Trisakti University were returning to campus in the late afternoon after demonstrating near the parliament building, men in mobile Police brigade uniforms appeared on the flyover overlooking Trisakti. They shot and killed four students and wounded two more. Riots of 13–14 May On 13 and 14 May, rioting across Jakarta destroyed many commercial centres and over a thousand died. Ethnic Chinese were targeted. The riots were allegedly instigated by Indonesian military members who were out of uniform. Homes were attacked and, women were raped by gangs of men who wore ordinary clothing. The US State Department and a government fact-finding team found that \\"elements of the military had been involved in the riots, some of which were deliberately provoked\\". However, most of the deaths suffered when Chinese owned supermarkets in Jakarta were targeted for looting from 13–15 May were not Chinese, but Javanese looters who were burnt to death by the hundreds when a fire broke out. Over a thousand and as many as five thousand people died during these riots in Jakarta and other cities such as Surakarta. Many victims died in burning malls and supermarkets, but some were shot or beaten to death. The riots destroyed thirteen markets, 2,479 shop-houses, 40 malls, 1,604 shops, 45 garages, 383 private offices, nine filling stations, eight public buses and minivans, 1,119 cars, 821 motorcycles, and 1,026 houses. Allegations of the involvement of the military in planning the riots In 1998, one of the key generals was Prabowo, son of former Finance Minister Dr. Sumitro Djojohadikusumo. Prabowo had received anti-terror training at Fort Bragg and Fort Benning in the US. In May 1998, Prabowo was the commander of Kostrad, the strategic reserve, the division Suharto commanded when he took power in 1965. One of Prabowo's friends, Muchdi Purwopranjono ran Kopassus (special forces), and another, Syafrie Samsuddin, headed the Jakarta Regional Command. The Indonesian military had been split since the mid-1990s into a \\"red and white\\" nationalist faction led by Armed Forces commander General Wiranto and a \\"green\\" Islamist faction headed by Prabowo. A security officer alleged that during the riots, Kopassus (special forces) officers had ordered the burning down of a bank. A taxi driver reported hearing a man in a military helicopter encouraging people on the ground to carry out looting. Shopowners at a plaza claimed that before the riots, military officers tried to extract protection money. A teenager claimed he and thousands of others had been trained as protesters. A street child alleged that Kopassus officers ordered him and his friends to become rioters. There was a report of soldiers being dressed up as students and taking part in the rioting. Eyewitnesses spoke of the destruction being organised, with bands of men with short haircuts directing looters into shops, malls and banks, and of rioters being transported in military trucks. Rape victims testified that ethnic Chinese women were targeted, with assaults planned in advance. Syafrie failed to order his troops to quell the riots, and a report subsequently emerged that Syafrie had actually been in radio contact with the gangs terrorising the city. It is possible that Prabowo hoped the riots would discredit his rival Wiranto and result in Suharto appointing Prabowo to head the armed forces. Resignation of Suharto Suharto reads his address of resignation at Merdeka Palace on 21 May 1998, watched by Vice-president B. J. Habibie, who succeeded him. By the middle of May, there were demonstrations in cities across the country, and students were occupying the parliament building, with no efforts from the authorities to remove them. On 18 May, to the surprise of journalists at a press conference, Suharto loyalists and speaker of the People's Consultative Assembly and People's Representative Council Harmoko called for Suharto's resignation. Meanwhile, Amien Rais, leader of the Islamic organisation Muhammadiyah, declared he would organise a demonstration of a million supporters to call for Suharto's resignation. This was planned for 20 May, celebrated as Indonesia's Indonesian National Awakening. On the evening of 18 May, influential Muslim intellectual Nurcholish Madjid, who had held various meetings with generals and civilians, met with Suharto. The meeting ended with Suharto telling Nurcholish of his intention to resign \\"as soon as possible\\" following a meeting with Muslim leaders. This two-hour meeting took place on the morning of 19 May. Afterwards, Suharto announced to the nation that he would reshuffle the cabinet and set up a reform committee to plan new elections. Following a warning from a Prabowo ally of possible bloodshed, Amien Rais called off the demonstration. On 20 May, there was a \\"massive show of force\\" from the military, with soldiers and armoured vehicles on the streets of Jakarta. Prabowo wanted a robust response to the demonstrators, but Wiranto realised that the Suharto era was coming to an end and was more receptive to the students' demands. According to sources of the Jakarta Post, Wiranto visited Suharto at home and asked the president to resign. On the same day, some of Suharto's allies refused to serve in a new cabinet. Facing a threat of impeachment from Harmoko, and having received a letter from 14 cabinet members rejecting the formation of a new cabinet, Suharto decided to resign. At 9 am on the morning of 21 May, Suharto made a short speech of resignation. He was immediately replaced by Vice-president B. J. Habibie. Allegedly, late on the evening of 21 May, Prabowo arrived at the presidential palace and demanded that he be made the chief of the armed forces. Reportedly, Habibie escaped from the palace. The following day, Prabowo was sacked as head of Kostrad. Wiranto remained as chief of the armed forces, and his troops began removing the students from the parliament building. Aftermath Not so often reported was the silent departure of families and wealth from the country. The emigrants were not exclusively of Chinese descent, but also included wealthy natives (pribumi) and Suharto's cronies. The immediate destination was Singapore, where some stayed permanently while others moved on to Australia, the US and Canada. Many of these families returned when the political situation stabilised a few years later. Since the fall of the New Order, there has been a variety of state-sponsored initiatives to address the widespread abuses of human rights since the fall of Suharto. A report issued by the International Center for Transitional Justice and the Indonesian Commission for Disappeared Persons and Victims of Violence (KontraS) concluded that, that \\"senior government officials consistently failed to achieve truth, accountability, institutional reform and reparations for the most severe crimes.

Guilly was the daughter of a Belgian and a Frenchman. She was born in Brussels as a child, she lived alternately in Brussels and Paris. she later moved to Paris as a musician and writer. It occurred to her that blind people on the streets of Paris were increasingly endangered by the motorization of transport. The police in France used white signal sticks to regulate traffic and stop cars. Mrs d'Herbemont had the idea of putting the color white or white-painted sticks visually impaired and blind transporters in order to draw attention to themselves. In 1930, d'Herbemont wrote a letter to the director of the national daily newspaper L'Écho de Paris. This letter was published causing much consternation. On February 7, 1931, d'Herbemont symbolically presented, in the presence of several ministers, the first two white canes. These were given to a blind soldier and a blind civilian. These were followed by the distribution of 5000 white canes to blind French veterans from World War I and blind civilians.

He is mentioned in records between 1324 and 1349, but neither before nor after these dates. He wrote, in Middle High German, a collection of fables entitled Der Edelstein ('The Jewel') (c. 1349), one hundred in number, which were based principally on those of Avianus (4th century) and the Anonymus Neveleti (edited by Isaac Nicolas Nevelet, 1610). He dedicated this work to the Bernese patrician and poet, , advocatus (Vogt) of Brienz (d. c. 1350). It was printed in 1461 at Bamberg by Albrecht Pfister and was one of the first books printed in the German language.

It was first mentioned by the Ancient Greek geographer Ptolemy in his Geographia, under the name Apulon.

The two roads merge at Apula, with the next stop on the route being Brucla.

She was born in Cork, but grew up in England. Voynich was a significant figure, not only on the late Victorian literary scene, but also in Russian émigré circles. She is best known for her novel The Gadfly, which became hugely popular in her lifetime, especially in Russia. Biography Ethel Lilian Boole was born on 11 May 1864, at Lichfield Cottage, Blackrock, Ballintemple, Cork,Waddington, P. (2015), \\"Voynich [née Boole], Ethel Lilian [Lily; E. L. V.] (1864–1960), novelist, translator, and musician\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography the youngest daughter of mathematician George Boole (father of Boolean logic), and mathematician and educationalist Mary Everest,Sometimes given as Everett. Showalter 1977, p. 63. who was the niece of George Everest and a writer for Crank, an early-20th-century periodical.Showalter 1977, pp.251–252. Her father died six months after she was born. Her mother returned to her native England with her daughters, and was able to live off a small government pension until she was appointed librarian at Queen's College, London. When she was eight, Ethel contracted erysipelas, a disease associated with poor sanitation. Her mother decided to send her to live in Lancashire with her brother, believing that it would be good for her health. Described as \\"a religious fanatic and sadist\\", who regularly beat his children, he apparently forced Ethel to play the piano for hours on end. Ethel returned to London at the age of ten. She became withdrawn, dressing in black and calling herself \\"Lily\\". At the age of eighteen she gained access to a legacy. This allowed her to study piano and musical composition at the Hochschule für Musik in Berlin, which she attended between 1882 and 85. During this period she became increasingly attracted to revolutionary politics. Back in London she learned Russian from Sergei Kravchinski, known as Stepniak who encouraged her to go to Russia. From 1887 to 1889 she worked as a governess in St. Petersburg, where she stayed with Kravchinski's sister-in-law, Preskovia Karauloff. Through her, she became associated with the revolutionary Narodniks. After her return to the UK, she settled in London, where she became involved in pro-Revolutionary activity. With Kravchinski she founded the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom, and helped to edit Free Russia, the Narodniks's English-language journal.Sally Mitchell, Victorian Britain: An Encyclopedia, Routledge, 2012, p.837. In 1890 she met Michał Habdank-Wojnicz, a Polish revolutionary who had escaped from Siberia. Soon he also became Ethel Boole's life-partner. By 1895, they were living together and she was calling herself Mrs. Voynich. They married in 1902. In 1904 he anglicised his name to Wilfrid Michael Voynich and became an antiquarian book dealer, giving his name eventually to the Voynich manuscript. In 1897 she published The Gadfly, which was an immediate international success. She published three more novels Jack Raymond (1901), Olive Latham (1904) and An Interrupted Friendship (1910), but none matched the popularity of her first book. The Voyniches emigrated to the United States in 1920, after Wilfred had moved the main base of his book business to New York. She concentrated more on music from this point on, working in a music school, but she continued her writing career as a translator, translating from Russian, Polish and French. A final novel, Put off thy Shoes, was published in 1945. Voynich was unaware of the vast sales of The Gadfly in the Soviet Union until she was visited in New York by a Russian diplomat in 1955, who told her how highly regarded she was in the country. The following year Adlai Stevenson secured an agreement for the payment of $15,000 royalties to her.Gray, Anne, The World of Women in Classical Music, Seven LOCKS, 2007, P.886-7. Ethel Lilian Voinich died July 27, 1960 at the age of 96. According to her will, her body was cremated, and the ashes scattered over Central Park in New York City. Alleged affair with Reilly According to the British journalist Robin Bruce Lockhart, Sidney Reilly – a Russian-born operative employed by the émigré intelligence network of Scotland Yard's Special Branch – met Ethel Voynich in London in 1895. Lockhart, whose father, R.H. Bruce Lockhart knew Reilly, claims that Reilly and Voynich had a sexual liaison and voyaged to Italy together. During their romance Reilly is said to have bared his soul and revealed to her the story of his espionage activities. After their brief affair, Voynich published The Gadfly, whose central character Arthur Burton was based on Reilly.Robin Bruce Lockhart, Reilly: Ace of Spies; 1986, Hippocrene Books, . In 2004, writer Andrew Cook suggested that Reilly may have been reporting on Voynich and her political activities to William Melville of the Metropolitan Police Special Branch.Andrew Cook, Ace of Spies: The True Story of Sidney Reilly, 2004, Tempus Publishing, . Page 39. In 2016, new evidence surfaced from archived communication between Anne Fremantle, who attempted a biography of Ethel Voynich, and a relative of Ethel's on the Hinton side. The evidence demonstrates that a liaison of some sort took place between Reilly and her in Florence, 1895.Gerry Kennedy, The Booles and the Hintons, Atrium Press, July 2016 pp 274-276 Work=The Gadfly She is most famous for her first novel The Gadfly, first published in 1897 in the United States (June) and Britain (September), about the struggles of an international revolutionary in Italy who was loosely based on the figure of Giuseppe Mazzini. This novel was very popular in the Soviet Union and was the top bestseller and compulsory reading there, where it was seen as ideologically useful; for similar reasons, the novel has been popular in the People's Republic of China as well. By the time of Voynich's death The Gadfly had sold an estimated 2,500,000 copies in the Soviet Union and had been made into two Russian movies, first in 1928 in Soviet Georgia (Krazana) and then again in 1955.Cork City Libraries provides a downloadable PDF of Evgeniya Taratuta's 1957 biographical pamphlet Our Friend Ethel Lilian Boole/Voynich, translated from the Russian by Séamus Ó Coigligh. The pamphlet gives some idea of the Soviet attitude toward Voynich. Historian Mark Mazower describes The Gadfly as ‘a radical fin de siècle English novel’ translated into Yiddish by his grandfather, Max Mazower, being published in 1907 in Vilna, then part of the Russian Empire, now Vilnius, Lithuania. Its dramatic story serves as an allegory form the struggle for liberty in Russia. Not only did it circulate widely among socialists in Russia, it appealed enormously to people of progressive ideas elsewhere with soaring popularity in Britain towards the end of the First World War. Sidney Reilly, the famous British “Ace of Spies” is said to have either modelled himself on or served as a model for Voynich's hero. Reilly, in turn, was used by Ian Fleming as a model for James Bond, the most famous fictional spy of the Cold War. The 1955 film of the novel, by the Soviet director Aleksandr Fajntsimmer is noted for the fact that composer Dmitri Shostakovich wrote the score (see The Gadfly Suite). Along with some other excerpts, the Romance movement has since become very popular. Shostakovich's Gadfly theme was also used in the 1980s, in the BBC TV series Reilly, Ace of Spies. In 1980 the novel was adapted again as a TV miniseries The Gadfly, featuring Sergei Bondarchuk as Father Montanelli. Various other adaptations exist, including at least three operas and two ballets. Other Novels Voynich's other four novels never achieved the same success as The Gadfly, but two of them extended its narrative. An Interrupted Friendship (1910) elaborates on The Gadfly's protagonist's backstory, and Put Off Thy Shoes (1945), Voynich's last novel, further focuses on the life of the protagonist's family and ancestors; a \\"lengthy, multi-generational chronicle\\" set in the 18th century. Her second novel, Jack Raymond (1901), was quickly followed by her third, Olive Latham (1904). Nearly a decade later, Voynich took a hiatus from writing and focused on music.MacHale, Desmond. The Life and Work of George Boole: A Prelude to the Digital Age. Cork: Cork University Press, 2014, p. 314. Music Voynich began composing music around 1910. She joined the Society of Women Musicians during World War I. After she and her husband moved to New York, she devoted herself much more to music, creating many adaptations and transcriptions of existing works. In 1931 she published an edited volume of Chopin's letters. Gerry Kennedy, The Booles and the Hintons, Atrium Press, July 2016 From 1933 to 1943 she worked at the Pius X School of Liturgical Music in Manhattan. While there she composed a number of cantatas and other works that were performed at the college, including Babylon, Jerusalem, Epitaph in Ballad Form and The Submerged City. She also researched the history of music, compiling detailed commentaries on music of various eras. Most of her music remains unpublished and is held at the Library of Congress. Recent evaluation in 2005 of the cantata Babylon by an eminent English composer was not very favourable. 'The general impression is of amateurism and gaucheness'.

Inevitably, such deposits are sedimentary in nature. Not a formal term, it tends to be used more to describe especially dense collections such as Lagerstätte. It is also applied to brecciated and stalagmitic deposits on the floor of caves, which frequently contain osseous remains. In a more restricted sense, the term is used to describe certain thin layers of bony fragments, which occur in well-defined geological strata. One of the best- known of these is the Ludlow Bone Bed, which is found at the base of the Downton Sandstone in the Upper Ludlow series. At Ludlow (England) itself, two such beds are actually known, separated by about . of strata. Although quite thin, the Ludlow Bone Bed can be followed from that town into Gloucestershire, for a distance of . It is almost completely made up of fragments of spines, teeth and scales of ganoid fish. Another well-known bed, formerly known as the Bristol or Lias Bone Bed, exists in the form of several thin layers of micaceous sandstone, with the remains of fish and saurians, which occur in the Rhaetic Black Paper Shales that lie above the Keuper marls, in the south-west of England.

It is one of many theoretical explanations for the Fermi paradox. The hypothesis is that alien life intentionally avoids communication with Earth, and one of its main interpretations is that it does so to allow for natural evolution and sociocultural development, avoiding interplanetary contamination, similarly to people observing animals at a zoo. The hypothesis seeks to explain the apparent absence of extraterrestrial life despite its generally accepted plausibility and hence the reasonable expectation of its existence. A variant on the zoo hypothesis suggested by Ball is the laboratory hypothesis, where humanity is being subjected to experiments, with the Earth being a giant laboratory. Aliens might, for example, choose to allow contact once the human species has passed certain technological, political, or ethical standards. They might withhold contact until humans force contact upon them, possibly by sending a spacecraft to planets they inhabit. Alternatively, a reluctance to initiate contact could reflect a sensible desire to minimize risk. An alien society with advanced remote-sensing technologies may conclude that direct contact with neighbors confers added risks to oneself without an added benefit. In the related laboratory hypothesis, the zoo hypothesis is extended such that the 'zoo keepers' are subjecting humanity to experiments, a hypothesis which Ball describes as \\"morbid\\" and \\"grotesque\\", overlooking the possibility that such experiments may be altruistic, i.e., designed to accelerate the pace of civilization to overcome a tendency for intelligent life to destroy itself, until a species is sufficiently developed to establish contact, as in the zoo hypothesis. Assumptions The zoo hypothesis assumes, first, that whenever the conditions are such that life can exist and evolve, it will, and secondly, there are many places where life can exist (i.e. that there are a large number of alien cultures in existence). It also assumes that these aliens have great reverence for independent, natural evolution and development. In particular, assuming that intelligence is a physical process that acts to maximize the diversity of a system's accessible futures,A. D. Wissner-Gross, \\"Causal entropic forces\\", Physical Review Letters 110, 168702 (2013). a fundamental motivation for the zoo hypothesis would be that premature contact would \\"unintelligently\\" reduce the overall diversity of paths the universe itself could take. These ideas are perhaps most plausible if there is a relatively universal cultural or legal policy among a plurality of extraterrestrial civilizations necessitating isolation with respect to civilizations at Earth-like stages of development. In a universe without a hegemonic power, random single civilizations with independent principles would make contact. This makes a crowded Universe with clearly defined rules seem more plausible. If there is a plurality of alien cultures, however, this theory may break down under the uniformity of motive concept because it would take just a single extraterrestrial civilization to decide to act contrary to the imperative within our range of detection for it to be undone, and the probability of such a violation of hegemony increases with the number of civilizations. This idea, however, becomes more plausible if all civilizations tend to evolve similar cultural standards and values with regard to contact much like convergent evolution on Earth has independently evolved eyes on numerous occasions, or all civilizations follow the lead of some particularly distinguished civilization, such as the first civilization among them. Fermi paradox With this in mind, a modified zoo hypothesis becomes a more appealing answer to the Fermi paradox. The time between the emergence of the first civilization within the Milky Way and all subsequent civilizations could be enormous. Monte Carlo simulation shows the first few inter-arrival times between emergent civilizations would be similar in length to geologic epochs on Earth. Just what could a civilization do with a ten-million, one-hundred- million, or half-billion-year head start?Kardashev scale Kardashev, N.S. (1964). Soviet Astronomy. 8, 217 Even if this first grand civilization is long gone, their initial legacy could live on in the form of a passed-down tradition, or perhaps an artificial life form dedicated to such a goal without the risk of death. Beyond this, it does not even have to be the first civilization, but simply the first to spread its doctrine and control over a large volume of the galaxy. If just one civilization gained this hegemony in the distant past, it could form an unbroken chain of taboo against rapacious colonization in favour of non-interference in those civilizations that follow. The uniformity of motive concept previously mentioned would become moot in such a situation. If the oldest civilization still present in the Milky Way has, for example, a 100-million-year time advantage over the next oldest civilization, then it is conceivable that they could be in the singular position of being able to control, monitor, influence or isolate the emergence of every civilization that follows within their sphere of influence. This is analogous to what happens on Earth within our own civilization on a daily basis, in that everyone born on this planet is born into a pre-existing system of familial associations, customs, traditions and laws that were already long established before our birth and which we have little or no control over. Criticism Some critics of the hypothesis say that only a single dissident group in an alien civilization, or alternatively the existence of galactic cliques instead of a unified galactic club, would be enough to break the pact of no contact. To Stephen Webb, it seems unlikely, taking humans as reference, that such prohibition would be in effect for millions of years without a single breach thereof. Others say that the zoo hypothesis, along with its planetarium variation, is highly speculative and more aligned with theological theories. Appearance in fiction The zoo hypothesis is a common theme in science fiction. 1930s * 1937: In Olaf Stapledon's 1937 novel Star Maker, great care is taken by the Symbiont race to keep its existence hidden from \\"pre-utopian\\" primitives, \\"lest they should lose their independence of mind\\". It is only when such worlds become utopian-level space travellers that the Symbionts make contact and bring the young utopia to an equal footing. 1950s * 1951: Arthur C. Clarke's The Sentinel (first published in 1951) and its later novel adaptation 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) feature a beacon which is activated when the human race discovers it on the moon. An alien race has apparently visited us in the distant past. * 1953: In Childhood's End, a novel by Arthur C. Clarke published in 1953, the alien cultures had been observing and registering the Earth's evolution and human history for thousands (perhaps millions) of years. At the beginning of the book, when mankind is about to achieve spaceflight, the aliens reveal their existence and quickly end the arms race, colonialism, racial segregation and the Cold War. 1960s * In Star Trek, the Federation (including humans) has a strict Prime Directive policy of nonintervention with less technologically advanced cultures which the Federation encounters. The threshold of inclusion is the independent technological development of faster-than-light propulsion. In the show's canon the Vulcan race limited their encounters to observation until Humans made their first warp flight, after which they initiated first contact, indicating the practice predated the Human race's advance of this threshold. Additionally, in the episode \\"The Chase (TNG)\\", a message from a first (or early) civilization is discovered, hidden in the DNA of sentient species spread across many worlds, something that could only have been fully discovered after a race had become sufficiently advanced. * In Hard to Be a God by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, the (unnamed) medieval-esque planet where the novel takes action is protected by the advanced civilization of Earth, and the observers from Earth present on the planet are forbidden to intervene and make overt contact. One of the major themes of the novel is the ethical dilemma presented by such a stance to the observers. 1980s * 1986: In Speaker for the Dead by Orson Scott Card, the human xenobiologists and xenologers, biologists and anthropologists observing alien life, are forbidden from giving the native species, the Pequeninos, any technology or information. When one of the xenobiologists is killed in an alien ceremony, they are forbidden to mention it. This happens again until Ender Wiggin, the main character of Ender's Game, explains to the Pequeninos that humans cannot partake in the ceremony because it kills them. While this is not exactly an example of the zoo hypothesis, since humanity makes contact, it is very similar and the humans seek to keep the Pequeninos ignorant of technology. * 1987: In Julian May's 1987 novel Intervention, the five alien races of the Galactic Milieu keep the Earth under surveillance, but do not intervene until humans demonstrate mental and ethical maturity through a paranormal prayer of peace. * 1989: Iain M. Banks' The State of the Art depicts the Culture secretly visiting Earth and then deciding to leave it uncontacted, watching its development as a control group, to confirm whether their manipulations of other civilizations are ultimately for the best (the laboratory hypothesis). Other works by Banks depict the Culture (or a Culture equivalent) routinely manipulating less advanced civilizations, including pre-industrial ones (e.g., Inversions), both covertly and overtly, for philosophical or foreign policy purposes. * 1989: Bill Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes comic strip for November 8, 1989, alludes to the possibility of an ethical threshold for first contact (or at least for the prudence of first contact) in Calvin's remark \\"Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us.\\" 2000s * 2000: In Robert J. Sawyer's SF novel Calculating God (2000), Hollus, a scientist from an advanced alien civilization, denies that her government is operating under the prime directive. * 2002: In the Kingdom Hearts series of video games, the main characters interact with several worlds based upon Disney film franchises, separated into independent realms. In order to maintain the illusion that each world is independent of the larger Kingdom Hearts universe, Donald Duck will occasionally use his magic to warp his appearance, as well as the appearances of Goofy and the player character Sora. In addition, revealing any information about the outside world is forbidden within the Disney realms. * 2003: In South Park's inaugural episode of season seven, \\"Cancelled\\", aliens refrain from contacting Earth because the planet is the subject and setting of a reality television show. Unlike most variations of the zoo hypothesis where contact is not initiated in order to allow organic socioeconomic, cultural, and technological development, the aliens in this episode refrain from contact for the sole purpose of entertainment. In essence, the aliens treat all of Earth like the titular character in The Truman Show in order to maintain the show's integrity. * In the 2008 video game Spore, which simulates the evolution and life of species on a fictional galaxy, intelligent species in the \\"Space Stage\\" cannot contact those in previous stages, which did not unify their planets, nor develop spaceflight yet. However, they are allowed to abduct their citizens/members, to create crop circles in their terrain and to place in their planets a tool called \\"monolith\\", which accelerates their technological evolution.

The resacas constitute former channels of the Rio Grande and are naturally cut off from the river, having no inlet or outlet.  History  The Rio Grande's water moves from Colorado to the Gulf of Mexico. Every year during spring, melted snow would flow into the Rio Grande, bringing seasonal flood waters to the most southern tip of Texas. Given the overflow of the river's main and distributary channel banks, the Rio Grande would carve new river channels, resacas. When the seasonal flooding ended and the river retreated, the newly formed oxbow lakes remained, creating resacas all throughout the Rio Grande Valley. There are only 5 resacas left in the world and they are located within Cameron County in Texas.  Word origins  There are two explanations for the origin of the word resaca. The first explanation holds that it is a contraction of the Spanish phrase rio seco (dry river). The second explanation is that the word stems from the Spanish word resacar (to retake).

Description Although most speak of biblical theology as a particular method or emphasis within biblical studies, some scholars have also used the term in reference to its distinctive content. In this understanding, biblical theology is limited to a collation and restatement of biblical data, without the logical analysis and dialectical correlation between texts that systematic theology emphasizes.Carson, D. A. \\"Systematic Theology and Biblical Theology\\". In New Dictionary of Biblical Theology. Edited by T. Desmond Alexander and Brian S. Rosner. Downers Grove: InterVarsity, 2000, 102. Although the distinction existed prior, the beginning of biblical theology as a significant and separate discipline can be traced to J. P. Gabler’s 1787 address upon his inauguration as professor at the University of Altdorf, when he used the term and called for a separate discipline apart from the dogmatic emphasis of the confessions.Gabler, Johann P. \\"An Oration on the Proper Distinction between Biblical and Dogmatic Theology and the Specific Objectives of Each\\". In Old Testament Theology: Flowering and Future. Sources for Biblical and Theological Study. Edited by Ben. C. Ollenburger. Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2004. Some scholars focus on the Old Testament or Hebrew Bible and falls in the field of Old Testament theology. The field started out as a Christian endeavor written mostly by men and aimed to provide an objective knowledge of early revelation, working as much as possible only with these biblical texts and their historical contexts, in the twentieth century it became informed by other voices and views, including those of feminist and Jewish scholars, which provided new insights and showed ways that the early work was bound by the perspectives of their authors. Key scholars have included Walther Eichrodt, Gerhard von Rad, Phyllis Trible, and Jon Levenson. Others focus on the New Testament; the field of New Testament theology likewise seeks understanding from within the bounds of these documents and their historical contexts. Key scholars have included Rudolf Bultmann, Hendrikus Boers, and N. T. Wright. In evangelicalism In evangelicalism biblical theology is a discipline of theology which emphasises the progressive nature of biblical revelation. Graeme Goldsworthy explains the relationship between biblical theology and systematic theology as follows: The work of Gregory Beale, Kevin Vanhoozer, Geerhardus Vos (Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments), Herman Nicolaas Ridderbos (The Coming of the Kingdom), Meredith Kline (Kingdom Prologue), Graeme Goldsworthy (According to Plan, Gospel and Kingdom), Vaughan Roberts (God's Big Picture), James Hamilton (God's Glory in Salvation through Judgment), and Peter Gentry and Stephen Wellum (Kingdom through Covenant: A Biblical-Theological Understanding of the Covenants) have helped popularize this approach to the Bible.Gaffin, Richard B.

Biblical theology movement (1940s–1960s) The biblical theology movement was an approach to Protestant biblical studies that was popular in the United States, particularly among Presbyterians, between the 1940s and early 1960s. Heavily influenced by neo-orthodoxy, the movement sought to escape the polarization of liberal theology and Christian fundamentalism. Important themes included: \\"1) The Bible as a theological resource; 2) The unity of the Bible; 3) The revelation of God in history; 4) The Bible’s distinctly Hebraic mentality; and 5) The uniqueness of biblical revelation.\\" Scholars included G.

These are generally unproductive, and covered with stunted wood; but the lower country is fertile, and finely clothed with the baobab, the tamarind and various valuable fruit-trees. Bondu is traversed by torrents, which flow rapidly during the rains but are empty in the dry season. The inhabitants were mostly Fula, though the Mandinka of the area controlled trade. Most people were Muslim and the legal structure followed Islamic law, but it was not known as a strictly observant region. This cites A. Rançon, Le Bondou: étude de géographie et d'histoire soudaniennes de 1681 à nos jours (Bordeaux, 1894). History Bondu was controlled by Mande rulers until the second half of the 17th century when Muslim Fulas took over in what is regarded as the first of the Fula jihads in West Africa.\\"The Islamic revolution in the western Sudan: The First Fulani Jihad.\\" (p. 10) Encyclopædia Britannica. 2013. (accessed 6 March 2013) Mungo Park, the first European traveller to visit the country, passed through Bondu in 1795, and had to submit to many exactions from the reigning monarch. The royal residence was then at Fatteconda; but when Major William Gray, a British officer who attempted to solve the Niger problem, visited Bondu in 1818 it had been moved to Bulibani (Boolibany), a village with a population of 1500–1800, surrounded by a strong clay wall. In August 1845 the king of Bondu signed a treaty recognizing French sovereignty over his country. The treaty was disregarded by the natives, but in 1858 Bondu came definitively under French control.

The film was released by Paramount Pictures. Based on the 1957 novel Mandingo by Kyle Onstott, and on the 1961 play Mandingo by Jack Kirkland (which is derived from the novel), Mandingo received mixed reviews upon release, but was a box office hit. It was followed by a sequel in 1976, titled Drum, which also starred Norton. Sylvester Stallone was an uncredited extra. Plot The movie is set in the Deep South of the United States prior to the American Civil War. Falconhurst is a run-down plantation owned by widower Warren Maxwell and largely run by his son, Hammond. Hammond and his cousin, Charles, visit a plantation where both men are given black women out of hospitality. Hammond chooses Ellen, who is a virgin. Both she and Hammond watch as Charles abuses and rapes the other woman, with Charles claiming that she likes it. Hammond asks Ellen if this is true, and she says no. Hammond then rapes Ellen. Warren Maxwell pressures him to marry, so Hammond chooses his cousin, Blanche, who is desperate to get out of her house to escape her brother Charles. It is implied that Charles raped her when she was 13. After their wedding night, Hammond is sure that she is not a virgin—a claim Blanche denies. On their way back from their honeymoon, Hammond returns to the plantation where Ellen is kept and purchases her as his sex slave. Eventually, he comes to genuinely care for her. Meanwhile, Hammond purchases a Mandingo slave named Ganymede. Nicknamed \\"Mede\\", the slave works for Hammond as a prize-fighter. He's forced to soak in a large cauldron of very hot salt water to ostensibly toughen his skin. Hammond also breeds Mede with female slaves on his plantation. Hammond makes a great deal of money betting on Mede's fights. Rejected by Hammond, Blanche becomes a slovenly alcoholic who does nothing all day long. While Hammond is on a business trip alone, Blanche discovers Ellen is pregnant. Correctly assuming the baby is Hammond's, Blanche beats Ellen. Ellen flees, but falls down some stairs, and miscarries. Hammond (who had promised Ellen that her baby would be freed), returns to Falconhurst and discovers Ellen lost the baby. Threatened with bodily harm by Warren, Ellen does not tell him how she miscarried. Hammond gives Ellen a pair of ruby earrings, which she wears while serving an evening meal. Hammond gave the matching necklace to Blanche, who becomes enraged to find Ellen being publicly favored by Hammond. Hammond leaves on another business trip, taking Ellen with him. A drunken Blanche demands that Mede come to her bedroom. Although the other slaves attempt to stop him, Mede does as he is ordered. Blanche says she will accuse Mede of rape if he does not have sex with her, so he spends the night with her. Blanche's sexuality is reawakened by Mede, whom she finds exceptionally well-endowed, and she has sex with him several more times. Hammond returns to the plantation. A great deal of time has passed since Hammond and Blanche's marriage, and Warren Maxwell is eager for a grandchild. Sensing that the marriage is troubled, Warren locks Hammond and Blanche in a room together and refuses to let them out until they reconcile. They appear to do so. A short time later, Blanche announces she is pregnant, but when the baby is born, it is clear the child is a mulatto. To avoid a scandal, the child is killed on doctor's orders. Sickened at Blanche's sexual indiscretion, Hammond asks the doctor if he has the poison he uses on old slaves and horses. He pours the poison into a toddy for Blanche. An outraged Hammond seeks out Mede, intending to kill him. As Hammond attempts to force Mede into a boiling cauldron of water, Mede tries to tell him that Blanche blackmailed him into having sex. Hammond shoots Mede twice with a rifle and the second shot throws Mede into the boiling water. Hammond uses a pitchfork to drown Mede. In a fit of fury, the slave Agamemnon (Richard Ward) picks up the rifle and aims it at Hammond. When Warren calls him a \\"crazy nigger\\" and demands that he put the gun down, the slave shoots and kills Warren. As he runs away, Hammond kneels helpless next to Warren's lifeless body. Cast Perry King and Brenda Sykes in Mandingo * James Mason as Warren Maxwell * Susan George as Blanche Maxwell * Perry King as Hammond Maxwell * Richard Ward as Agamemnon * Brenda Sykes as Ellen * Ken Norton as Mede * Sylvester Stallone as Lynching Witness (uncredited) Production=Development and writing The original novel sold over 4.5 million copies. Film rights were eventually bought by Dino de Laurentiis. Producer Ralphe Serpe said during filming that the movie was: > A human, sociological story that's going to bring about a better > understanding between the races ... We're faithful to the story of the book > but not the spirit. I mean, the book's hackwork, isn't it? It's almost > repulsive. A lot of people have read it, but they read it for the wrong > reasons. It's really a story of love. We had the script rewritten three > times. ... I hated that ending in the book where the guy boils the slave > down and pours the soup over his wife's grave. I mean, we have the slave > boiled but we cut out the part where he pours the soup on his grave. He just > ... pulls away. And we know that tomorrow there's going to be a lot of > trouble. It's really a very beautiful ending. Charlton Heston turned down the role of the father and the role of his son was rejected by Timothy Bottoms, Jan Michael Vincent, Jeff Bridges and Beau Bridges. Boxer Ken Norton turned down a $250,000 gate to fight Jerry Quarry to make the film. Home media Paramount Pictures licensed the film to Legend Films for its first official DVD release. The DVD was released on June 3, 2008, in 1.77:1 anamorphic widescreen version without any extras. Reception=Critical response Roger Ebert despised the film, calling it \\"racist trash\\", and gave it a \\"zero star\\" rating. Richard Schickel of Time magazine found the film boring and cliché-ridden. Movie critic Robin Wood was enthusiastic about the film, calling it \\"the greatest film about race ever made in Hollywood.\\" In Leonard Maltin's annual publication Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide, the film is ranked as a \\"BOMB\\" and dismissed with the word \\"Stinko!\\" Some prominent critics hailed the film, including the New York Times columnist Dave Kehr, who called it \\"a thinly veiled Holocaust film that spares none of its protagonists\\", further describing it as \\"Fleischer's last great crime film, in which the role of the faceless killer is played by an entire social system.\\" Director Quentin Tarantino has cited Mandingo and Showgirls as the only two instances \\"in the last twenty years [that] a major studio made a full-on, gigantic, big-budget exploitation movie\\". In Django Unchained, Tarantino took the terminology of \\"Mandingo fighting\\" from the use of \\"a Mandingo\\" being a fine slave for breeding in the film.Daniel Bernardi The Persistence of Whiteness: Race and Contemporary ... – 2013 \\"For the purposes of breeding chattel, he must also buy a \\"Mandingo\\" buck, a male slave. In the film, a \\"Mandingo\\" represents the finest stock of slaves deemed most suitable for fighting and breeding.\\" On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 26% critical approval rating based on 19 reviews and has an average score of 4.63/10.  Racial criticism  In the 21st century, the film has been recognised for the heavy use of racist stereotypes, that were created during the height of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and were used to help commodify black people and justify slavery. The film has also been the subject of racial analysis. Some publications and writers condemned its release even in 1975, including Roger Ebert, who called it \\"racist trash, obscene in its manipulation of human beings and feelings, and excruciating to sit through in an audience made up largely of children, as I did last Saturday afternoon\\". Sequel Drum, the sequel to Mandingo, was released the following year. Released by United Artists, it was once again produced by Dino De Laurentiis. Ken Norton, Brenda Sykes, and Lillian Hayman were the only actors from the first film to return for the sequel. Norton and Sykes played different characters, and Hayman returned in the role of Lucretia Borgia. Warren Oates took over for Perry King in the role of Hammond Maxwell. The story is set 15 years after the events of the first film.

From left to right: Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel; Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester; Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham; Henry, Earl of Derby (later Henry IV); and Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick. The Lords Appellant were a group of nobles in the reign of King Richard II, who, in 1388, sought to impeach some five of the King's favourites in order to restrain what was seen as tyrannical and capricious rule. The word appellant simply means '[one who is] appealing [in a legal sense]'. It is the older (Norman) French form of the present participle of the verb appeler, the equivalent of the English 'to appeal'. The group was called the Lords Appellant because its members invoked a procedure under law to start prosecution of the king's unpopular favourites known as 'an appeal': the favourites were charged in a document called an \\"appeal of treason\\", a device borrowed from civil law which led to some procedural complications.Anthony Tuck, ‘Lords appellant (act. 1387–1388)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2010 accessed 12 Oct 2010 Members There were originally three Lords Appellant: Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, son of Edward III and thus the king's uncle; Richard FitzAlan, Earl of Arundel and of Surrey; and Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. These were later joined by Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby (the future king Henry IV) and Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham.  Success  They achieved their goals, first establishing a Commission to govern England for one year from 19 November 1386.Anthony Goodman, The Loyal Conspiracy:The Lords Appellant under Richard II, (University of Miami Press, 1971), 13. In 1387, the Lords Appellant launched an armed rebellion against King Richard and defeated an army under Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford at the skirmish of Radcot Bridge, outside Oxford.Anthony Goodman, The Loyal Conspiracy:The Lords Appellant under Richard II, 129-130. They maintained Richard as a figurehead with little real power. They had their revenge on the king's favourites in the \\"Merciless Parliament\\" (1388). The nominal governor of Ireland, de Vere, and Richard's Lord Chancellor, Michael de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, who had fled abroad, were sentenced to death in their absence.Anthony Goodman, The Loyal Conspiracy:The Lords Appellant under Richard II, 44. Alexander Neville, Archbishop of York, had all his worldly goods confiscated. The Lord Chief Justice, Sir Robert Tresilian, was executed, as were Sir Nicholas Brembre, Lord Mayor of London, John Beauchamp of Holt, Sir James Berners, and Sir John Salisbury. Sir Simon Burley was found guilty of exercising undue influence over the king and was sentenced to death.Anthony Goodman, The Loyal Conspiracy:The Lords Appellant under Richard II, 46. Derby and Nottingham, together with the Duke of York, tried to win a reprieve for him, but he was executed on 5 May. Aftermath In 1389, Richard's uncle, John of Gaunt, returned from Spain and Richard was able to rebuild his power gradually until 1397, when he reasserted his authority and destroyed the principal three among the Lords Appellant. However, in 1399 Richard was deposed by Gaunt's son, Henry of Bolingbroke, partly as a result of the royal confiscation of Gaunt's estate on his death. Bolingbroke succeeded him as Henry IV. Richard never forgave the Lords Appellant. His uncle Gloucester was murdered in captivity in Calais; it was (and remains) widely believed that he was killed on Richard's orders. The Earl of Arundel was beheaded. Warwick lost his title and his lands and was imprisoned on the Isle of Man until Richard was overthrown by Henry Bolingbroke. The behaviour of the two junior Lords Appellant, Bolingbroke and Mowbray, probably influenced Richard's decision in 1398 to exile them both, and to revoke the permission he had given them to sue for any inheritance which fell due, as it did in relation to Mowbray's grandmother and, more significantly, of Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt.

It is part of the Payachata complex of volcanoes, together with Parinacota Volcano to the south. The name \\"Payachata\\" means \\"twins\\" and refers to their appearance. It hosts glaciers down to elevations of , lower on the northern slope. Pomerape is a complex of lava domes, accompanied by lava flows which were emplaced atop of the domes. It was active about 200,000 years ago. The lava domes formed first and were later buried by the actual volcanic cone, which unlike the rhyolitic- dacitic domes is formed by hornblende andesite. The \\"Chungará Andesites\\" and lava dome complex of Parinacota were laid down at this time. Pomerape is associated with an adventive vent that has erupted mafic magmas. The main cone was last active 106,000 +- 7,000 years ago, the adventive vent is dated to 205,000 ± 24,000 years ago. Climbing the volcano is alpine grade PD by the east ridge.

Life and career Hullah was born at Worcester. He was a pupil of William Horsley from 1829, and entered the Royal Academy of Music in 1833. He wrote an opera to words by Dickens, The Village Coquettes, produced in 1836;J. Hullah & C. Dickens, The village coquettes: a comic opera in two acts (Richard Bentley, London 1836).

From 1839, when he went to Paris to investigate various systems of teaching music to large masses of people, he identified himself with Wilhem's system of the fixed \\"Do,\\" in contrast to the moveable \\"Do\\" of the Tonic sol-fa. His adaptation of Wilhem's system was taught with enormous success from 1840 to 1860. His first ever lesson was given at the Battersea College for training teachers (now University St Mark and St John Plymouth),in 1840, at the instigation of educationalist and college Principal James Kay Shuttleworth. One of his famous pupils was Edmund Hart Turpin.Edmund Hart Turpin , cyberhymnal.org, Retrieved 16 December 2014 St Martin's Hall. In 1847 a large building in Long Acre, called St Martin's Hall, was built by subscription and presented to Hullah. It was inaugurated in 1850 and burnt to the ground in 1860, a blow from which Hullah was long in recovering. In 1849 William Sterndale Bennett, founder and chairman of the Bach Society, invited Hullah to join his committee with a view to producing the first English performance of Johann Sebastian Bach's St Matthew Passion, which took place on 6 April 1854.JR Sterndale Bennett, \\"The Life of William Sterndale Bennett\\" (Cambridge, 1907) p 204 As a sight-singing pioneer, Hullah produced his popular series Vocal Scores (1846) and Part-Music (1867). A series of lectures was given at the Royal Institution in 1861, and in 1864 he lectured in Edinburgh, but in the following year he was unsuccessful in his application for the Reid professorship. He conducted concerts in Edinburgh in 1866 and 1867, and the concerts of the Royal Academy of Music from 1870 to 1873; he had been elected to the committee of management in 1869. In 1872 he was appointed by the Council of Education as Musical Inspector of Training Schools for the United Kingdom. In 1878 he went abroad to report on the condition of musical education in schools, and wrote a very valuable report, quoted in the memoir of him published by his wife in 1886. He was attacked by paralysis in 1880, and again in 1883. Dr. Hullah was Honorary Fellow of King's College, London, and Professor of Vocal Music at Queen's College, London and Bedford College, London.Back matter: 'Works by John Hullah' (Longmans advertising supplement in The Third or Transition Period of Musical History (1876)). He succeeded Dr. Horsley as organist of the Charterhouse (in its original London location) in 1858, and held the post until his death.F. Hullah, Life of John Hullah LL.D (Longmans, Green & Co., London 1886), p. 74. He received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Edinburgh in 1876.F. Hullah, Life of John Hullah LL.D, p. 207. His compositions, which remained popular for some years after his death in 1884, consisted mainly of ballads (such as his musical adaptation of Charles Kingsley's poem, \\"Three Fishers\\"); but his importance in the history of music is due to his exertion in popularizing musical education, and his persistent opposition to the Tonic sol-fa system, which had a success he could not foresee. His objections to it were partly grounded on the character of the music which was in common use among the early teachers of the system.

The number of hours per week allowed gradually increased over the years from below 30 hours in the 1950s. Until 1967 the BBC was allowed to play only five hours per day of commercial gramophone records on the air. It continued to affect BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2 and the Independent Local Radio stations until 1988. The result was that the BBC had to use \\"cover\\" versions of popular songs by groups such as Shane Fenton and the Fentones recorded at the BBC studios, or orchestral versions by one of the in-house orchestras, to fill in the hours. The term \\"needle time\\" comes from the use (at the time) of gramophone records as the main source of recorded music, which were played on gramophone record players using a gramophone needle. Needle time notice British records at the time carried a warning message around the edge of the record label in the centre of the record itself to the effect that: \\"Unauthorised public performance or broadcasting of this record is strictly prohibited.\\" Radio Luxembourg Although the record industry in Britain wanted the public to buy its records, it had to give them some airtime so that the public could find out about their existence. To that end the record industry used the commercial nighttime signals from Radio Luxembourg whose powerful AM signal could be heard in the UK. The \\"208\\" shows on Luxembourg were mainly fifteen minutes to thirty minutes in length and presented under names such as the Decca Records Show or the Capitol Records Show. These prerecorded programmes resembled what later became known as infomercials, because they normally only featured a little over half of the record, with heavy plugging for title, artist and label. Because all the hours of transmission were booked up by the major record companies (EMI, Decca, Pye, Philips etc.) groups and artists had to sign to them to get any exposure. This was one of the driving forces for Ronan O'Rahilly and others to start the first pirate radio station to get exposure for artists he represented. The \\"pirate stations\\" Unlike the BBC or Radio Luxembourg, the offshore pirate radio stations of the 1960s operated not only outside the three-mile limit of territorial waters, but also in a grey area of the law. Because the studios and transmitters were located on board the ships or offshore structures, the personnel on board were only under the authority of the captain of that ship or structure. In the case of ship stations such as Wonderful Radio London which introduced top 40 radio to Britain, the ship was registered in a foreign country and therefore subject to the laws of that country, which did not recognise \\"needle time\\".

The result of this effort was an open protocol specification, which is publicly available. The standardisation effort was necessary to replace the huge number of deprecated homemade software clients and servers (some of them still using BTX emulation). While IFX (Interactive Financial Exchange), OFX (Open Financial Exchange) and SET (Secure Electronic Transaction) are tailored for the North American market, HBCI is designed to meet the requirements of the European market.

Versions= HBCI 2.2 PIN/TAN  HBCI 2.2 PIN/TAN (or HBCI+) is an extension to HBCI that added a security method based on PINs and TANs, which had already been in use with BTX and web banking.  FinTS 3.0  For version 3.0, which formally introduced the PIN/TAN method, the specification was renamed to FinTS, whereas the original DSA- and RSA-based security method retained the name HBCI.  FinTS 4.0  In version 4.0, the basic message syntax was switched over to XML. Further, the number of roundtrips necessary was reduced, allowing asynchronous communication (e.g. via SMTP) for simple transaction dialogues.

Biography Bond was born at Hanwell, London, England, the son of a schoolmaster. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood, and in 1832 obtained a post in the Public Record Office. In 1838, he became an assistant in the manuscript department of the British Museum, where he attracted the notice of his chief, Sir Frederic Madden, a leading paleographer of his day, and in 1852 he was made Egerton librarian. In 1856, he became assistant keeper of manuscripts, and in 1867 was promoted to the post of keeper. His work in reorganising the manuscript department was of lasting value, and to him is due the classified catalogue of manuscripts, and the improved efficiency and punctuality of publication of the department. In 1873, he was appointed principal librarian of the British Museum. Under his supervision, the new buildings of the White Wing were erected, to accommodate prints, drawings, manuscripts and newspapers. The purchase of the Stowe manuscripts was concluded while he was in office. He founded, in conjunction with Sir Edward Maunde Thompson, the Palaeographical Society, and made scientific improvements to classical palaeography. He was made LL.D. of Cambridge in 1879, created CB in 1885, and KCB the day before his death in January 1898. Bond published little, but he was the editor of four volumes of facsimiles of Anglo-Saxon charters from 679 to the Conquest, The Speeches in the Trial of Warren Hastings (1859–1861), and a number of other historic documents. He married Caroline Frances Barham (22 July 18231 August 1912), second daughter of the Reverend Richard Harris Dalton Barham.s:Essays in librarianship and bibliography/The Late Sir Edward A.

That is, a property of spaces is a topological property if whenever a space X possesses that property every space homeomorphic to X possesses that property. Informally, a topological property is a property of the space that can be expressed using open sets. A common problem in topology is to decide whether two topological spaces are homeomorphic or not. To prove that two spaces are not homeomorphic, it is sufficient to find a topological property which is not shared by them. Common topological properties= Cardinal functions  * The cardinality X of the space X. * The cardinality \\\\vertτ(X)\\\\vert of the topology of the space X. * Weight w(X), the least cardinality of a basis of the topology of the space X. * Density d(X), the least cardinality of a subset of X whose closure is X.  Separation  Note that some of these terms are defined differently in older mathematical literature; see history of the separation axioms. * T0 or Kolmogorov. A space is Kolmogorov if for every pair of distinct points x and y in the space, there is at least either an open set containing x but not y, or an open set containing y but not x. * T1 or Fréchet. A space is Fréchet if for every pair of distinct points x and y in the space, there is an open set containing x but not y. (Compare with T0; here, we are allowed to specify which point will be contained in the open set.) Equivalently, a space is T1 if all its singletons are closed. T1 spaces are always T0. * Sober. A space is sober if every irreducible closed set C has a unique generic point p. In other words, if C is not the (possibly nondisjoint) union of two smaller closed subsets, then there is a p such that the closure of {p} equals C, and p is the only point with this property. * T2 or Hausdorff. A space is Hausdorff if every two distinct points have disjoint neighbourhoods. T2 spaces are always T1. * T2½ or Urysohn. A space is Urysohn if every two distinct points have disjoint closed neighbourhoods. T2½ spaces are always T2. * Completely T2 or completely Hausdorff. A space is completely T2 if every two distinct points are separated by a function. Every completely Hausdorff space is Urysohn. * Regular. A space is regular if whenever C is a closed set and p is a point not in C, then C and p have disjoint neighbourhoods. * T3 or Regular Hausdorff. A space is regular Hausdorff if it is a regular T0 space. (A regular space is Hausdorff if and only if it is T0, so the terminology is consistent.) * Completely regular. A space is completely regular if whenever C is a closed set and p is a point not in C, then C and {p} are separated by a function. * T3½, Tychonoff, Completely regular Hausdorff or Completely T3. A Tychonoff space is a completely regular T0 space. (A completely regular space is Hausdorff if and only if it is T0, so the terminology is consistent.) Tychonoff spaces are always regular Hausdorff. * Normal. A space is normal if any two disjoint closed sets have disjoint neighbourhoods. Normal spaces admit partitions of unity. * T4 or Normal Hausdorff. A normal space is Hausdorff if and only if it is T1. Normal Hausdorff spaces are always Tychonoff. * Completely normal. A space is completely normal if any two separated sets have disjoint neighbourhoods. * T5 or Completely normal Hausdorff. A completely normal space is Hausdorff if and only if it is T1. Completely normal Hausdorff spaces are always normal Hausdorff. * Perfectly normal. A space is perfectly normal if any two disjoint closed sets are precisely separated by a function. A perfectly normal space must also be completely normal. * T6 or Perfectly normal Hausdorff, or perfectly T4. A space is perfectly normal Hausdorff, if it is both perfectly normal and T1. A perfectly normal Hausdorff space must also be completely normal Hausdorff. * Discrete space. A space is discrete if all of its points are completely isolated, i.e. if any subset is open. * Number of isolated points. The number of isolated points of a topological space.  Countability conditions  * Separable. A space is separable if it has a countable dense subset. * First-countable. A space is first-countable if every point has a countable local base. * Second-countable. A space is second-countable if it has a countable base for its topology. Second-countable spaces are always separable, first-countable and Lindelöf.  Connectedness  * Connected. A space is connected if it is not the union of a pair of disjoint non-empty open sets. Equivalently, a space is connected if the only clopen sets are the empty set and itself. * Locally connected. A space is locally connected if every point has a local base consisting of connected sets. * Totally disconnected. A space is totally disconnected if it has no connected subset with more than one point. * Path-connected. A space X is path-connected if for every two points x, y in X, there is a path p from x to y, i.e., a continuous map p: [0,1] → X with p(0) = x and p(1) = y. Path-connected spaces are always connected. * Locally path-connected. A space is locally path-connected if every point has a local base consisting of path-connected sets. A locally path-connected space is connected if and only if it is path-connected. * Arc-connected. A space X is arc-connected if for every two points x, y in X, there is an arc f from x to y, i.e., an injective continuous map f: [0,1] → X with p(0) = x and p(1) = y. Arc-connected spaces are path-connected. * Simply connected. A space X is simply connected if it is path-connected and every continuous map f: S1 → X is homotopic to a constant map. *Locally simply connected. A space X is locally simply connected if every point x in X has a local base of neighborhoods U that is simply connected. *Semi-locally simply connected. A space X is semi- locally simply connected if every point has a local base of neighborhoods U such that every loop in U is contractible in X. Semi-local simple connectivity, a strictly weaker condition than local simple connectivity, is a necessary condition for the existence of a universal cover. * Contractible. A space X is contractible if the identity map on X is homotopic to a constant map. Contractible spaces are always simply connected. * Hyper-connected. A space is hyper-connected if no two non-empty open sets are disjoint. Every hyper-connected space is connected. * Ultra-connected. A space is ultra- connected if no two non-empty closed sets are disjoint. Every ultra-connected space is path-connected. * Indiscrete or trivial. A space is indiscrete if the only open sets are the empty set and itself. Such a space is said to have the trivial topology.  Compactness  * Compact. A space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover. Some authors call these spaces quasicompact and reserve compact for Hausdorff spaces where every open cover has finite subcover. Compact spaces are always Lindelöf and paracompact. Compact Hausdorff spaces are therefore normal. * Sequentially compact. A space is sequentially compact if every sequence has a convergent subsequence. * Countably compact. A space is countably compact if every countable open cover has a finite subcover. * Pseudocompact. A space is pseudocompact if every continuous real-valued function on the space is bounded. * σ-compact. A space is σ-compact if it is the union of countably many compact subsets. * Lindelöf. A space is Lindelöf if every open cover has a countable subcover. * Paracompact. A space is paracompact if every open cover has an open locally finite refinement. Paracompact Hausdorff spaces are normal. * Locally compact. A space is locally compact if every point has a local base consisting of compact neighbourhoods. Slightly different definitions are also used. Locally compact Hausdorff spaces are always Tychonoff. * Ultraconnected compact. In an ultra-connected compact space X every open cover must contain X itself. Non- empty ultra-connected compact spaces have a largest proper open subset called a monolith.  Metrizability  * Metrizable. A space is metrizable if it is homeomorphic to a metric space. Metrizable spaces are always Hausdorff and paracompact (and hence normal and Tychonoff), and first-countable. Moreover, a topological space (X,T) is said to be metrizable if there exists a metric for X such that the metric topology T(d) is identical with the topology T. * Polish. A space is called Polish if it is metrizable with a separable and complete metric. * Locally metrizable. A space is locally metrizable if every point has a metrizable neighbourhood.  Miscellaneous  * Baire space. A space X is a Baire space if it is not meagre in itself. Equivalently, X is a Baire space if the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. * Topological Homogeneity. A space X is (topologically) homogeneous if for every x and y in X there is a homeomorphism f : X -> X such that f(x) = y. Intuitively speaking, this means that the space looks the same at every point. All topological groups are homogeneous. * Finitely generated or Alexandrov. A space X is Alexandrov if arbitrary intersections of open sets in X are open, or equivalently if arbitrary unions of closed sets are closed. These are precisely the finitely generated members of the category of topological spaces and continuous maps. * Zero-dimensional. A space is zero-dimensional if it has a base of clopen sets. These are precisely the spaces with a small inductive dimension of 0. * Almost discrete. A space is almost discrete if every open set is closed (hence clopen). The almost discrete spaces are precisely the finitely generated zero-dimensional spaces. * Boolean. A space is Boolean if it is zero-dimensional, compact and Hausdorff (equivalently, totally disconnected, compact and Hausdorff). These are precisely the spaces that are homeomorphic to the Stone spaces of Boolean algebras. * Reidemeister torsion * \\\\kappa-resolvable. A space is said to be κ-resolvable (respectively: almost κ-resolvable) if it contains κ dense sets that are pairwise disjoint (respectively: almost disjoint over the ideal of nowhere dense subsets). If the space is not \\\\kappa-resolvable then it is called \\\\kappa-irresolvable. * Maximally resolvable. Space X is maximally resolvable if it is \\\\Delta(X)-resolvable, where \\\\Delta(X) = \\\\min\\\\\\\\{G : G eq\\\\emptyset, G\\\\mbox{ is open}\\\\\\\\}. Number \\\\Delta(X) is called dispersion character of X. * Strongly discrete. Set D is strongly discrete subset of the space X if the points in D may be separated by pairwise disjoint neighborhoods. Space X is said to be strongly discrete if every non-isolated point of X is the accumulation point of some strongly discrete set.

She was named for Rear Admiral Thornton A. Jenkins. Jenkins was laid down on 24 March 1911 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; launched on 29 April 1912; sponsored by Miss Alice Jenkins, daughter of Rear Admiral Jenkins; and commissioned on 15 June 1912, Lieutenant Commander E. H. Delany in command. Pre-World War I In the years that preceded World War I, Jenkins, based at Newport, Rhode Island, trained with the Atlantic Fleet, sailing to the Caribbean for winter maneuvers operating along the East Coast in summer. In addition, she sailed to Tampico, Mexico in mid-April 1914 to support the American occupation of Veracruz. World War I As the war raged in Europe, Jenkins continued patrol operations along the North American coast in search of possible German U-boats. The patrols and maneuvers sharpened her war-readiness, so that she was ready for any eventuality when she sailed for Europe on 26 May 1917. Based at Queenstown, Ireland, Jenkins and her sister destroyers patrolled the eastern Atlantic, escorting convoys and rescuing survivors of sunken merchantmen. She continued escort and patrol duty for the duration of the war. Though she made several submarine contacts, no results were determined. Following the signing of the Armistice on 11 November 1918, Jenkins sailed for home, arriving Boston, Massachusetts on 3 January 1919. LCDR James L. Kauffman received the Navy Cross for service as Commanding Officer of Jenkins during World War I. Inter-war period The destroyer operated along the Atlantic coast until arriving at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 20 July. She remained there until decommissioning on 31 October.

He appointed the James McGill Professor at McGill University in 2001. Life Born in Preston, Ontario (now part of Cambridge). He obtained his undergraduate education at the University of Toronto obtaining a B.A. in anthropology in 1959. Trigger received a doctorate in archaeology from Yale University in 1964. He was taught by George Peter Murdock and Benjamin Irving Rouse. He was co-supervised by co-supervised by William Kelly Simpson and Michael D. Coe. He became friends with K. C. Chang, a Chinese archaeologist, who joined the department during his final year of his PhD. His doctoral work was funded by a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Award. His PhD thesis entitled \\"History and Settlement of Lower Nubia\\" argued that four principle parameters determined the density of Nubia over 4,000 years: the height of floods, agricultural techniques, foreign trade and wars. He spent the following year teaching at Northwestern University and subsequently took a position, as Assistant Professor, with the Department of Anthropology at McGill University in Montreal, and remained there for the rest of his career. He was married to Dr Barbara Welch, a British geographer trained in Physical Geography, who was despite being less known than her husband was considered an equally sophisticated thinker. Pamela Jane Smith writes in her obituary of Bruce Trigger that \\"It is little known outside Canada that Bruce had a deep and profound influence on the development of archaeology in his homeland and is seen as one of the great Canadian intellectuals along with Harold Innis, Northrop Frye and Marshall McLuhan.\\" Contributions Bruce Trigger contributed to a wide range of fields and wrote on many aspects of archaeology. He published over 20 books including the book \\"A History of Archaeological Thought\\" which became required reading in the discipline. Leo Klejn (2008:4, (Lev Samuilovich Klejn, known as Leo Klejn, who was an internationally acclaimed Russian archaeologist) who corresponded with him for a considerable period of time wrote of him \\"Since then I always felt (and said) that if there were another archaeologist in the world whose positions were the most similar to mine, it would be Bruce Trigger.\\" He described (2008:4) Bruce and his contributions after his death as: \\"Today no other scholar is able to skillfully embrace the whole multifaceted range of activities of this modest and calm man. There must have been something unique about his spirit or personality that inspired and equipped him to deal creatively with American Indians, Ancient Egypt, world civilizations and the theory and history of archaeology, and it is interesting to try to understand some of the principles underlying his explorations of these very different themes.\\" Archaeological fieldwork During his doctoral degree at Yale he was also the Chief Archaeologist for the 1962 Yale/Pennsylvania excavations at Armina West in Egyptian Nubia. These excavations were directed by William Kelly Simpson. Bruce was also the Staff Archaeologist with the 1963-1964 Oriental Institute Sudan Expedition for the UNESCO campaign. Ethnohistory He was arguably best known for The Children of Aataentsic, his two-volume study of the Huron peoples, a work which remains the definitive study on the history and ethnography of that people. The Children of Aataentsic earned Trigger numerous accolades, including adoption by the Huron- Wendat Nation as an honorary member. Trigger would later reiterate some of the key arguments of the book in Natives and Newcomers, a polemical work aimed at educating laypeople. In Natives and Newcomers Trigger, writing in the tradition of Franz Boas, argued that the colonial and Aboriginal societies of early Canada all possessed rich and complex social and cultural systems, and that there are no grounds to argue that any society of early Canada was superior to the others. History of archaeology Trigger's book A History of Archaeological Thought investigates the history of the development of theory and archaeology as a discipline. The first version was published by Cambridge University Press in 1989. This book was described as \\"the first ever to examine the history of archaeological thought from medieval times to the present in world-wide perspective\\" A second and expanded edition of this book was published in 2006. The second book \\"introduces new archaeological perspectives and concerns. At once stimulating and even-handed, it places the development of archaeological thought and theory throughout within a broad social and intellectual framework.\\" He published a number of articles on this topic: * Trigger, Bruce Graham 1981 Anglo‐American Archaeology World Archaeology 13(2: Regional traditions of archaeological research 1): 138–155. * Trigger, Bruce Graham 1983 American Archaeology as Native History: A Review Essay.

Archaeological theory In Understanding Early Civilizations: A Comparative Study Trigger uses an integrated theoretical approach to look at the meaning of similarities and differences in the formation of complex societies in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, Shang of China, Aztecs and Classic Maya of Mesoamerica, Inka of the Andes, and Yoruba of Africa. In 2004 a session at the Society for American Archaeology (SAA) conference was dedicated to the research of Bruce Trigger. Trigger also made significant contributions to theory and debates on epistemological issues within archaeology. The 2003 book \\"Artifacts and Ideas\\" is a collection of previously published papers that trace the history and development of these contributions. In particular were his arguments about how the social and political contexts of research affect archaeological interpretation. One essay entitled \\"Archaeology and the Image of the American Indian\\" documents how archaeological interpretation reflected and legitimated stereotypes of Native American peoples and expressed the dominant political ideas and interests of Euro-American culture. For example, prior to 1914 Euro-American stereotypes resulted in a prehistory that saw native cultures as being primitive and inherently static. It was commonly believed that Native Americans had not undergone any significant developmental changes and that they were incapable of change. It was believed that natives had arrived in the Americas only recently, and this \\"fact\\" explained their alleged lack of cultural development. Some early Euro-American archaeologists explained away the contrary evidence of earthwork mounds as the creations of \\"more enlightened\\" non-native peoples who had been exterminated by Native American savages. These popular beliefs, supported by the claims of early archaeologists, served to legitimate the displacement of native peoples from their homelands. John Wesley Powell, who led the debunking of the mound builder myths, not coincidentally also recognized that great injustices had been perpetuated against Native American peoples. Although Trigger recognized that Euro-American political interests tended to influence and distort interpretations of the archaeological record, he also argued that the accumulation of evidence served to correct these distortions. Honours and awards He received a number of academic awards and numerous other honours such as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada from 1976, he became a recipient of their Innis-Gérin Medal in 1985. In 1979 he was awarded the Cornplanter Medal. In 1991, he was recipient of the Québec Government’s Prix Léon-Gérin. The Québec Government in 2001 made him an Officer of the National Order of Quebec while five years later, in 2005, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. His most cherished honour was his adoption in 1989 into the Great Turtle Clan of the Wendat (Huron) Confederacy, with the name Nyemea. Trigger died of cancer on December 1, 2006.

Dirt track racing started in the United States before World War I and became widespread during the 1920s and 1930s using both automobiles and motorcycles. Two different types of race cars dominate -- open wheel racers in the Northeast and West and stock cars in the Midwest and South. While open wheel race cars are purpose- built racing vehicles, stock cars (also known as fendered cars) can be either purpose-built race cars or street vehicles that have been modified to varying degrees. Dirt track racing is the single most common form of auto racing in the United States. There are hundreds of local and regional racetracks throughout the nation. The sport is also popular in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Racetrack Late model class drivers show how dirt track car drivers slide their car's back end around through a corner. The multiple cars show the different angles that occur whilst driving through a corner. The track surface may be composed of any soil, but most racers prefer a track with a clay base. The curation of a racetrack is a long and complex job and requires hours of work. Typically the machines for track curation include a grader, cultivator, roller and water truck however this varies at different dirt tracks around the world. Typically the track is graded and 'dug up' after the racing is finished and then it is watered with a water truck. It may be then broken down with a cultivator or rolled. These steps are repeated however many times necessary and do vary according to climate, location and soil composition. North America Nearly all tracks are oval and less than in length with most being ½ mile (804 m) or less. The most common increments in the U.S. are ½ mile, ⅜ mile (603 m), ⅓ mile (536 m), ¼ mile (402 m), and ⅛ mile (201 m). With the longer tracks, the race cars achieve higher speeds up to 160 mph (257kmh) and the intervals between cars increase. This decreases the chance of crashes but increases the damage and chance of injury when cars do crash. United Kingdom In Great Britain the oval tracks are normally on grass with lengths of 400 meters (¼ mile) to 800 meters (½ mile). The races consist of several four lap qualifying heats that eliminate slower drivers. Then there is a final race featuring the fastest competitors. Europe In mainland Europe, long tracks can be grass, sand or cinder, and can be up to long. Australia Dirt track racing in Australia has a history dating back to the 1920s and 1930s. Most oval track speedways are similar to those in the US for car racing such as sprint cars, speedcars (midgets) and sedans, with most tracks generally around ¼ mile (402 m) to ⅓ mile (536 m) in length. Most tracks have a clay surface, though some use dolomite, dolomite and clay mix or even sand and clay mix. During the 1970s and early 1980s, a small number of tracks were paved with asphalt, though this phase only lasted about a decade and all tracks paved over eventually reverted to their former surfaces. Race vehicles A typical dirt track \\"street stock\\" car racing in Wisconsin, USA Each racetrack or sponsoring organization maintains a rule book outlining each class of race car which includes dimensions, engine size, equipment requirements and prohibitions. The requirements for each class are usually coordinated with multiple tracks to allow for the widest available venue for each type of car. This coordination allows the drivers to compete at many different racetracks, increase competitors' chances of winning, and lets racing associations develop a series of race events that promote fan interest. Many tracks support two types of racing in their programs, open wheel cars and stock cars. Both types range from large and powerful V8 engines to small yet still powerful, four- cylinder engines. Some of the smaller open wheel race cars have classes for single-cylinder engines. Depending on the class, the cars may have wings to aid in handling at higher speeds. Open wheel cars sprint cars Open wheel cars are generally manufactured with tubular frames and a body purchased for that particular class. The wheels of these vehicles are not protected by fenders; they are exposed or \\"open\\". Classes include: *Dwarf (5/8 replicas of 1928 to 1948 coupes and sedans) *Mod lite - 1000-1250cc motorcycle engines (5/8 replicas of full size modified but equally as fast) *Kart (go kart) *Mini sprint- 600-1200cc motorcycle engines. Usually utilize a top wing. *Winged sprint- 410ci, 360ci engine, or 305ci engines. The top wing helps these fast and powerful racecars with downforce. *Non-wing sprint car *Silver crown *Midget (speedcar) *Three quarter midget (TQ) *Quarter midget *600 and 270 micro sprints Open wheel sanctioning bodies include: *USAC - The United States Automobile Club *World of Outlaws Sprint Cars (410ci engine national touring series) *All Star Circuit of Champions (410ci engine upper Midwest, mid- Atlantic and Atlantic touring series) *National Sprint League (410ci engine Midwest touring series) *American Sprint Car Series (ASCS) (360ci engine national touring series) *United Sprint Car Series (USCS) (360ci engine mid south and south touring series) *MOWA (410ci engine Midwest touring series) *POWRi (midgets and mini sprints) Popular chassis manufacturers around the country for winged sprint cars are Eagle, Maxim, J&J;, Triple X, and GF1. There are also several engine builders that build both 410ci and 360ci engines for traveling sprint car teams. Speedway, Kistler, Gaerte, Wesmar, Shaver, Don Ott Racing Engines, and Fisher Racing Engines are the more popular engine builders. Modified cars IMCA Modified car Modified cars are a hybrid of open wheel cars and stock cars. This class of car has the racing characteristics of a stock car. The rear wheels are covered by fenders but the front wheels are left exposed. There are sanctioning bodies that control the rules for this class at most tracks. Each sanctioning body has their own set of guidelines provided in an annual rule book and their own registration fees. Sanctioning bodies include: *Super DIRTcar Series *IMCA (International Motor Contest Association) *UMP (United Midwestern Promoters) *USRA (United States Racing Association) *USMTS (United States Modified Touring Series) *WISSOTA (WISSOTA Promoters' Association) *TSMA (Tri-State Modified Association) Full-bodied cars Full-bodied cars, sometimes referred to as stock cars, are vehicles that, unlike open-wheel cars, have fenders covering all wheels. Full-bodied cars can vary from full tube frame chassis and aluminium bodied late models to automobiles manufactured by the major automakers with certain modifications as allowed for each class. There are several general types: =Non-production cars= These are stock cars custom built for racing, usually with welded tubular frames and custom built or purchased bodies. The most popular type of dirt full-bodied stock cars are late models. They are categorized depending on what track and series that is being run. The racetrack dictates what type of late model is raced, but most fall into one of these categories:  Late model  Current dirt super late models feature steel constructed tube frame chassis with aluminium bodies that give them the sleek aerodynamic appearance of a stock race car but there is nothing stock about these 2300 pound machines. The cars are powered by an motor than can turn in excess of 9,000 rpm. The engines are based on V-8 Chevrolet, Chrysler, and Ford power plants. These cars are considered to be the most sophisticated cars in dirt racing. They hit speeds well over 100 mph (160 km/h) and slide around the dirt corners. They are raced on dirt tracks throughout the country anywhere from 1/5 to one mile. The expense for these cars is significant. The cost for one complete race-ready late model is around $70,000. There is also cheaper equipment and parts that can be purchased, but staying competitive is much more expensive. To get the frame (chassis) and parts all new without the transmission and motor is around 20,000 to 30,000 dollars depending on the quality and from which manufacturer the chassis comes. The top manufacturers around the country include Rocket, Sweet- Bloomquist, Club 29, Longhorn, MB Customs, Black Diamond Racecars, GRT, Warrior, Barry Wright Racecars, Rayburn, MasterSbilt, Krypnonite and Schwartz Race Cars. The engines for these cars are around 850 horsepower and can cost up to 40,000 dollars. Motor builders include Hatfield Racing, Durham Racing Engines, Cornett Racing Engines, Sheered Engine Development, Gaerte Racing Engines, Clements Racing Engines, Custom Racing Engines, Vic Hill Racing Engines and Pro Power Engines. Most racing series and special events offer different motor options with the use of different total vehicle weights to create an even playing field: * Open motor - there is no displacement limit with this type of motor. Most open motors exceed 400 cubic inches but the 380 small block is also a common open motor. These motors utilize aluminium blocks and heads and often have specially welded cams. The cars which run this motor option must weigh at least . Cars utilizing a steel block must weigh 2300 lb. * Spec motor- spec motors are built to the series' specifications. The motor can be either steel, aluminium or a combination. Spec motors typically cannot exceed . Cars using this motor option weigh in at and run a or spoiler. * All steel motor - steel block and heads, a maximum of , and weigh in at either 2200 or 2150 pounds depending on the series. Cars with an all-steel motor must run a or spoiler.  Limited late model  Limited late models and late model stocks have the same body rules as super late models. The main difference in the two classes is the motor rules. Engine limitations typically include maximum engine displacement size, certain required cylinder head angles, maximum compression ratios, and maximum carburetor size. Suspension rules typically forbid the use of expensive canister shocks. Tire choice is also typically limited to a certain tire such as the Hoosier D55 spec tire.  Late model stock  Late model stocks have the same body rules as super late models and limited late models. This class typically has even more limited engine rules. Typical late model stock engine requirements: * Chevrolet 350, Chrysler 360, Ford 351 engines. Must be all-steel except intake manifold. * Engine maximum displacement of . * Engines typically cannot be modified except for aftermarket carburetor, intake manifold and exhaust manifold. Many different tracks and sanctioning bodies have variations on these rules of what constitutes an open late model, limited late model and a late model stock.  Crate late models  A Fastrak late model Crate late models use Chevrolet small-block engine engines that have been sealed with a special tag. Typical motors include the GM 602 and GM 604 engines. Recently the GM CT525 crate has been a popular choice of racers and some after-market Ford motors have surfaced in competition. Crate engines are sealed at the intake manifold, cylinder head, front cover, and oil pan with special twist off bolts. Crate engines must not be altered, modified, or changed in any way from factory specifications. Crate late models have three primarily Southern region touring series: the Durrence Layne Dirt Late Model Series, the United Crate Racing Alliance and the Fastrak Crate Late Model Series.  Popular late model racing series  * World of Outlaws Late Model Series *Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series *Southern All Star Racing Series (SAS) *Southern Nationals/Spring Nationals *International Motor Contest Association (IMCA) *United Midwestern Promoters (UMP) *Mid America Racing Series (MARS) *Midwest Late Model Racing Association (MLRA) *United Late Model Association (ULMA) There are hundreds of additional unsanctioned regional and national special events run throughout the year.

There is a high degree of variability between classes of modified cars. The lowest divisions of modified production cars may be completely stock except for having their interior or windshields removed. The highest divisions of modified production cars may have only a few original stock parts, and may be nearly as fast as late model race cars. Most cars have their glass windshields removed and their interiors stripped out. The original seat may be allowed to be used in the lowest classes, but a racing seat and roll cage is required to be installed in higher divisions. Other safety and performance features are added to higher division cars. The engines in lower divisions are completely stock, and higher divisions are highly modified and enhanced. Most modified production cars use full exhaust systems. Engines vary from unmodified 4 cylinders to highly modified V8. Cars in lower divisions use stock tires, and higher division cars use purpose-built specified racing tires. Common names of modified production car divisions: *Limited late model (604 crate LM) *602/sportsman (A-hobby/cadet/super street) *Pony/mini stocks (4-cyl.) *FWD front wheel drives (stingers/hot shots/hornets) BJP Racing or B&J; Performance is among the highest ranking 4cyl race cars in the country *Bombers (hobby/thunder/outlaw stock/pure stock) *Cruisers (Road warriors/renegades) *Legends/mod lites (dwarfs) =Unmodified production cars= These cars are automobiles just as driven on the street; including the original interiors. The engines may be modified as allowed under different rules:Saloon Motorcycles Dirt and grass track bikes have capacities of 250, 350, 500 and in the solo classes and can reach speeds of up to on the straights and with no brakes fitted to the machine. The American Grand National dirt track championship uses motorcycles of up to 750 cc capacities and can reach speeds of up to . There are three sidecar classes. The continental class has a 500 cc single-cylinder engine, also in Great Britain there are left- and right-handed sidecar machines with the engines up to 1000 cc. Sidecar races are some of the most exciting in Grass Track sport, with the driver and passenger working together to obtain the best grip and speed around the corners. Vintage racing Many obsolete race vehicles that were left in barns to rust are being restored to their former glory. The restored race vehicles are being displayed at car shows and sometimes raced. Cars that compete in vintage racing events are from the late 19th century to historic cars from a few years ago. There are more than 170 racing events in North America, and thousands of other vintage events sanctioned by hundreds of clubs.To Get Started Racing at Victory Lane Magazine Race program Four car heat race of vintage open wheel cars common in Wisconsin (USA) from the 1950s to 1970s The typical race program usually involves a number of classes, and many tracks offer both open wheel and stock car racing. There are a wide variety of event formats.  Hot laps (warm up or practice)  These races are 2-5 laps for drivers to get an understanding of the track conditions and the set up of their race cars. They are at the very start of the night before qualifying and the heat races. Qualifying A qualifying session happens before the start of the event. The Lucas Oil Dirt Late Model Series and the World of Outlaw Late Models use the qualifying system to line up their heat races. They give each driver 2 timed laps to get their times. This system is also used to line up the big crown jewel events. For most of the regional series they use the method called the \\"pill draw.\\" Before the races each driver draws a number and that determines where they start in their heat race. Recently the innovation of Transponder Scoring has brought dirt track racing into the internet immediate post \\"live\\" scoring and timing of events (Race Monitor). Heat races Preliminary races for each class, called heat races, frequently open the schedule. The heat races may determine the starting race position in the main events and usually earn season championship points. The heat races are shorter than the feature races, and not as many cars race in each heat, from 8 to 12 laps for a heat race. There are numerous formats for qualifying for the feature event. In a race where they qualify to determine their starting position for the heat race they use a \\"heads up\\" system. This system is where there is a predetermined set of cars that go to the A feature from the heat race, usually either the top 3 or 4. In a race where they use the pill draw to line up the heat races they use a method called passing points. In this system a driver receives a set number of points for where they finish, 1st-59 2nd-57 and so forth the lower they finish. To add to the points the driver gets for finishing, the driver also gets 1.5 points for each car they pass. They will then usually take the top 16 drivers with the highest total number of points and line up the A feature. Semi-feature/B main/last chance showdown There may be a semi-feature where unqualified racers may race their way into the remaining open starting positions in the A feature event. This race is called the last chance qualifier or B feature. The cars who did not make the A feature through the heat race or qualifying session get one more chance to qualify for the A feature through the B feature. The B length is anywhere up to circa 20 laps. Depending on how many B's there are determines how many transfer to the A, anywhere up to circa 6 will transfer. If a driver transfers through the B, they will start behind the drivers who made it through the heats / qualifying position. At selected other races with a larger car count, there may be more \\"alphabet soup\\" features (C, D, E, F, etc.). In those cases the drivers in the lower feature race will race with a certain number who advances to the next higher feature (e.g. top two in the F advance to the E, etc.). Feature/A main The A feature or main feature race is held for each division. The top cars from the event compete in the race. The starting positions may be determined by the season's point standings, or by a combination of the heat/qualifying speed/trophy dash/semi-feature finishing positions. It is usually the longest race in the program and depending upon the division it may range from 10 laps to 50 laps. Points, a trophy, and frequently a purse are generally awarded, with the amount of each is determined by finishing position. The winner of the feature event is considered the winner of the event. Special events Many tracks have special events which tends to draw a larger crowd. Occasionally, a track will sponsor a \\"powder-puff\\" race to allow women the opportunity to drive racecars for a few laps of racing. Otherwise, woman racers may compete in the same events as the men. Many tracks contract with a National and/or Regional touring racing association to schedule a sanctioned event. The racers in these events earn points for ranking within the series and sometimes the tracks points. The associations also usually require a guaranteed purse from the tracks of sanctioned events. Some tracks also have a \\"run-what-you-brung\\" contest usually toward the beginning of the season. Spectator racing pits two drivers from the stands who, after signing waivers, can run their personal automobiles against each other in a one-on-one 1 or 2 lap shootout. Dirt tracks tend to be somewhat more makeshift and more versatile than asphalt pavements, and can be converted for use in other motorsports. For instance, Little Valley Speedway in Little Valley, New York is a half-mile dirt track that can be converted into a figure-8 track, a demolition derby pit, or a tractor pull straightaway. Championships Both the racetracks and the racing associations award championships as determined by the guidelines of the associated rulebooks. Awards, usually for the top ten racers in each class, may include a trophy, a jacket, and a monetary amount. Track championships are awarded according to the points earned during the season. A certain number of points may be awarded for participation in an event and additional points added depending on the finish position in each race. The points earned at one track do not generally count toward another track's championship. At dirt tracks sanctioned by NASCAR, drivers can compete against drivers from other NASCAR-sanctioned tracks, both paved and dirt, for the statewide and provincial Whelen All-American Series championship, where the best performer of the state and provincial champions will win the national championship. All Dirt late model drivers won NASCAR's first such championship in 1982, and these drivers have frequently won regional and national championships in the 30-year history of NASCAR's short track championship, which only applies for local racing divisions (non-touring). The racing associations count points earned at the tracks for certain sponsored races similarly. Additionally they may promote the appearances of their drivers and winners at various other events.

Vernal pools, also called vernal ponds or ephemeral pools, are seasonal pools of water that provide habitat for distinctive plants and animals. They are considered to be a distinctive type of wetland usually devoid of fish, and thus allow the safe development of natal amphibian and insect species unable to withstand competition or predation by fish. Certain tropical fish lineages (such as killifishes) have however adapted to this habitat specifically. Vernal pools are a type of wetland. They can be surrounded by many communities/species including deciduous forest, grassland, lodgepole pine forest, blue oak woodland, sagebrush steppe, succulent coastal scrub and prairie. These pools are characteristic of Mediterranean climates, but occur in many other ecosystems. Generation and annual development An inundated rock vernal pool on Enchanted Rock. Note the one inhabited by cacti in the background. During most years, a vernal pool basin will experience inundation from rain/precipitation, followed by desiccation from evapotranspiration. These conditions are commonly associated with Mediterranean climate and reside mainly in the Central Valley of these regions. Vernal pool basins are often characteristics of Mediterranean climates. Most pools are dry for at least part of the year, and fill with the winter rains, spring snowmelts and rising water tables. Some pools may remain at least partially filled with water over the course of a year or more, but all vernal pools dry up periodically. Typically, though, a vernal pool has three phases each year: it is inundated in the winter (inundated phase) with the vernal pool holding onto the water from 10–65 days, it dries slowly during the spring (flowering phase), and it dries completely during the summer (dry phase). Vernal pools favor native species because many non-native species cannot tolerate the extreme seasonal changes in environmental conditions. Some vernal pools have an underlying impermeable clay layer (also known as a hardpan) that reduces water percolation. The impermeable layer is hydrophobic and it prevents water from draining into lower soil layers, allowing vernal pools to become inundated for a very long period of time. This feature of vernal pools means that the water is allowed to slowly evaporate instead of draining. This is a key factor in the development of vernal pool plant communities as it keeps the soil at the waters edge just wet enough for vernal plant communities to flourish while those closer to the center of the pool are more inundated, leading to zonation of plant communities as the water level recedes. This clay layer also allows pools to exist long enough to prevent upland species from developing, while existing for just enough time to prevent aquatic plant species from taking over. Some authorities restrict the definition of vernal pools to exclude seasonal wetlands that have defined inlet and outlet channels. The justification is that such seasonal wetlands tend to be qualitatively different from isolated vernal pools; this is because they are fed by larger drainage basins so that firstly, inflow contributes higher concentrations of dissolved minerals. Secondly, flow patterns increase the periodic scouring and silting effect of flows through or simply into the wetland. Thirdly, longer distance inflow and outflow make for less strictly endemic populations and plants. Low dissolved mineral concentrations of smaller vernal pool basins may be characterized as oligotrophic, and poorly buffered with rapid pH shifts due to carbon dioxide uptake during photosynthesis. Vernal pools are so called because they are often, though not necessarily, at their maximum depth in the spring (\\"vernal\\" meaning of, relating to, or occurring in the spring). There are many local names for such pools, depending upon the part of the world in which they occur. Vernal pools may form in forest, but they are more typically associated with grassland and rocky plains or basins. While many vernal pools are only a few meters in width, playas and prairie potholes are usually much larger, but still are otherwise similar in many respects, with high water in wet periods, followed by dry conditions. Some exclude desert playas from the definition of vernal pools because their larger closed drainage basins in areas with high evaporation rates produce higher concentrations of dissolved minerals, with salinity and alkalinity favoring different species. Playas may be inundated less frequently than vernal pools, and inundation typically coincides with colder weather unfavorable for plant growth. Ecology Despite being dry at times, vernal pools teem with life when filled, serving as critical breeding grounds for many amphibian and invertebrate species. The most obvious inhabitants are various species of breeding frogs and toads. Some salamanders also utilize vernal pools for reproduction, but the adults may visit the pool only briefly. Other notable inhabitants are Daphnia and fairy shrimp, the latter often used as an indicator species to decisively define a vernal pool. Other indicator species, at least in New England, are the wood frog, the spadefoot toad, and some species of mole salamanders. Notably, vernal pools are fishless, due to their ephemeral nature. Some of the species within vernal pools are endangered. Fairy shrimp are crustaceans in the family Branchinectidae. It takes about 30 hours for them to start to hatch in water and it takes 50 days for them to mature. In springtime, the eggs hatch and they can go dormant. There are different types of fairy shrimp in different vernal pools because the pools can act like islands because they are so isolated. Certain plant species are also associated with vernal pools, although the particular species depend upon the ecological region. The flora of South African vernal pools, for example, are different from those of Californian vernal pools, and they have characteristic Anostraca, such as various Branchipodopsis species. In some northern areas, tadpole shrimp are more common.Some vernal pool inhabitants are becoming threatened due to the habitat loss. One of these inhabitants includes the California Tiger Salamander.  Habitat loss  Vernal pools harbor a distinct assemblage of flora and fauna that, in some cases, aren't found anywhere else on the planet. Despite this fact, about 90% of vernal pool ecosystems in California have been destroyed. Disturbingly, much of this destruction has occurred in recent years, with about 13% of remaining vernal pools being lost in the short interval from 1995–2005. The major threats to vernal pool habitats in the Central Valley are agriculture, urbanization, changes in hydrology, climate change, and improperly managed grazing by livestock.  Restoration  Vernal pools are prime habitats to be targeted for restoration work due to their value as hotpots of biodiversity as well as recent history of extensive destruction and degradation. However, there have been varying rates of success attributed to various restoration efforts. A number of hypotheses exists as to why: Hypothesis 1: Constructed pools are too deep. Hypothesis 2: Edges of constructed pools narrower than natural ones. Hypothesis 3: Constructed pools have steeper slopes than natural ones. Results: Research suggest that the last two details (Hypothesis 2 & 3) are crucial in determining the habitat value of man-made vernal pools. In general, most constructed pools were too steep and did not have wide enough edges.  Mitigation  There has been a fair amount of controversy surrounding the practice of mitigation, which is the destruction of protected or endangered species and habitats, such as vernal pools, on the condition that whatever entity (business, land manager, etc.) is destroying the habitat will undertake the construction of a replacement habitat to \\"mitigate\\" their impacts. This concept is difficult to apply to vernal pools, which represent a tremendous habitat value- but are difficult to successfully replicate using construction methods (as mentioned above). Thus, it has been very controversial to apply mitigation strategies to vernal pool systems due to the obvious risks inherent in trying to reconstruct this kind of habitat. Although, some agencies are now requiring two replacements for every vernal pool that is destroyed, in order to compensate for the low quality of man-made habitat. Soils Vernal pools can form anywhere that a depression fills with rainwater, leading to low nutrients and low levels of dissolved salts. They are underlain with an impermeable layer of claypan, hardpan, or volcanic rock allowing for water retention. In many instances they contain grasslands that form over a variety of soil types containing silts and clays often covered by a layer of interwoven fibrous roots and dead leaves. The soil types present tend to relate to the local soil types and hydrology of the pool. Finer soils such as clay, silt, and muck are more common in perched situations, whereas pools which are more connected to the water table have more coarse soils like sand or gravel. Soils in vernal pools often reflect their inundated conditions, leading to low chroma horizons, mottling, and anoxic decay. They can develop hydric soils which are typical of flooded areas, including accumulations of organic matter, but this may not happen in drier areas. In some cases there is a hard pan layer which causes the retention of water in the pools. The hardpan clay basin accumulates water due to the small particle size and therefore reduced porosity. This permits flooding and development of vernal pools. Flora Vernal pool flowers, with different species occurring in zones related to soil moisture and temperature gradients formed as the pool dries out. Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge, Calif. In vernal pools, flowering occurs simultaneously because of the seasonality of favorable conditions. Vernal pool ecosystems may include both cosmopolitan species and endemic species adapted to unique environmental conditions. These conditions include moisture gradients, salinity gradients, and reduced levels of competition. Mircrotopographical gradients also contribute to species distribution in vernal pool communities, where plants that flower sooner in the season are more likely to be found at slightly higher elevations than later flowering species. Many vernal pool plants have buried seeds which accumulate in the soil. Different species are suited to different moisture levels, and as water evaporates from the edges of a pool, distinctive zonation of species can be seen. Most pools receive annual deposition of tree leaves, which are critical to maintaining local life due to leaf detritus. Many upland perennial plants are unable to withstand the period of flooding. Many wetland plants are unable to withstand the period of desiccation. Therefore, venal pools are a distinctive habitat that provides a refuge from both terrestrial and fully aquatic plants. When dissolved carbon dioxide is depleted by daytime photosynthesis, vernal pool species like Howell's quillwort (Isoetes howellii) and pygmyweed (Crassula aquatica) collect carbon dioxide nocturnally using Crassulacean acid metabolism. Vernal pool basin habitats favor annual plants with some uniquely adapted perennials which suffer extensive mortality resembling annual reproduction. Annuals comprise approximately 80 percent of vernal pool flora. Listed below are some genera of the approximately one hundred vascular plant species associated with California vernal pool habitats. A typical pool will include only 15 to 25 species. ;Cosmopolitan aquatic flora: * quillworts (perennial) * water clover (perennial) * pillworts (perennial) * water starworts * succulents * waterworts * mousetail * buttercups * spikerushes (perennial) * lilaea ;Vernal pool specialists: * stickyseeds * calicoflowers * button parsleys (perennial) * snorkelwort * false Venus' looking glass * pincushion plants * popcornflowers * woollyheads * Colusa grass * Orcutt grass * Solano grass Upland plants commonly found at vernal pools in California include yellow pansies, several sweet-scented clovers, yellow and bright lavender monkeyflowers, star lilies, and yarrow. Vernal pools are often threatened by development in the same way that other wetlands are. As a result, most pools have been converted into residential zones, roads, and industrial parks. That is why most extant pools occur on protected or private land such as national parks, and ranches. A large number of rare, endangered species, and endemic species occur in vernal pool areas. For example, the San Diego mesa mint, a highly endangered plant, is found exclusively in vernal pools in the San Diego area. Another example is the wildflower Lasthenia conjugens, which is found in limited parts of the San Francisco Bay Area. A third example is the herb Limnanthes vinculans endemic to Sonoma County, California. Fauna Vernal pool in northern California Many of the amphibians that breed only in vernal pools spend most of their lives in the uplands within hundreds of feet of the vernal pool. Eggs are laid in the vernal pool, then the juveniles leave the pool two or three months later, not to return until the following spring to breed. Therefore, the upland areas surrounding a vernal pool are critical for the survival of these species. In California and New York state, the endangered tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) is dependent on vernal pools to breed as described above. A few other obligate vernal pool species are the marbled salamander (Ambystoma opacum), Jefferson's salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonianum), the blue-spotted salamander (Ambystoma laterale) and the spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum). Some other species, notably Anostraca, fairy shrimp and their relatives, lay eggs capable of entering a state of cryptobiosis. They hatch when rains replenish the water of the pool, and no stage of the animals' life cycle leaves the pool, except when eggs are accidentally transported by animal phoresis, wind, or rarely, by flood. Such animal populations may be very old indeed, when the conditions for seasonal vernal waters are stable enough. As an extreme example, Branchipodopsis relictus on the main island of the Socotra archipelago, which is exceedingly remote for what it is, a continental fragment of Gondwana, is believed to have been isolated since the Miocene. Branchipodopsis relictus is correspondingly isolated genetically as well as geographically. Vernal pools can serve as a temporary habitat for migrating birds, especially in California. The rich invertebrate population in these pools provide food for ducks, herons, egrets, plovers and many other species.Silveira, Joseph G. \\"Avian uses of vernal pools and implications for conservation practice.\\" In Ecology, Conservation and Management of Vernal Pool Ecosystems.

Its offshoot website was launched in 1999 and closed in February 2015. CVG was the longest- running video game media brand in the world. History=Magazine Computer and Video Games was established in 1981, being the first British games magazine. Initially published monthly between November 1981 and October 2004 and solely web-based from 2004 onwards, the magazine was one of the first publications to capitalise on the growing home computing market, although it also covered arcade games. At the time of launch it was the world's first dedicated video games magazine.Plunkett, Luke. \\"The World's Oldest Video Game Publication Is Closing [UPDATE: Maybe Not?] \\" Kotaku. 29 May 2014. The first issue featured articles on Space Invaders, Chess, Othello and advice on how to learn programming. The magazine had a typical ABC of 106,000. Website Launched in August 1999, CVG was one of the UK and Europe's leading gaming web sites. Primarily known for its news service, CVG also features a mix of current and next-generation multi-format gaming reviews, previews, features and interviews, as well as a new emphasis on video and multimedia content. CVG was originally owned by EMAP, before being bought by Dennis Publishing. In 2004 CVG was acquired by Future Publishing who remain its current owners. In 2006, the site underwent a major re-design and relaunch to bring it up to scratch for the so-called next generation of Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii gaming. In 2007, CVG became the hub of a new CVG Network, hosting magazine sites for all of Future Publishing's unofficial gaming magazines including PC Gamer, PC Zone, Xbox World 360, PlayStation World, PSM3 and NGamer as well as long standing cheats site, CheatStation. The CVG Network expanded further in May 2007 to include sites like Xbox 360 Magazine, Edge and Next Generation.biz. CVG also has a very popular forum with many users and topics. CVG has also had a cult following with an award thread they used to run known as the yakkies. In May 2007, CVG submitted to electronic audit by the Audit Bureau of Circulation and registered 1.56 million monthly unique users and 11.4 million page impressions. Future has since incorporated the forums of many of its other games related publications to ComputerAndVideoGames.com in addition to devoting sections to those that did not previously have a formal website, such as PC Gamer. In early 2014, CVG, amongst other Future-operated websites, was earmarked for closure by management, but instead received staff cuts in July. Future announced the closure of the website in December 2014. The website closed on 26 February 2015, with all pages redirecting to Gamesradar+, another Future publication.  YouTube channel  Until the closure of CVG, their official YouTube channel provided a variety of video game related content, providing everything from walkthroughs of games to news regarding video game consoles and regarding gaming events. Their second longest running series, GTA V O'clock covered news and conspiracy theories regarding Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. It was one of the few publications invited to see and play Grand Theft Auto V before its release to the public on 17 September 2013 and re-release for PC on 14 April 2015. CVG Presents When the magazine did reappear it was in a new form, titled CVG Presents, on 16 April 2008 with a bi-monthly release schedule. The new format concentrates the whole magazine on a single subject. The first issue of the new format concentrated on the history of the Grand Theft Auto series of games. CVG Presents has not been published since 2009. Golden Joystick Awards CVG hosted the annual Golden Joystick Awards, the longest running gaming ceremony in the world and widely acknowledged as one of the most prestigious, as they're voted for solely by the general gaming public. Originally created in 1982 as the CVG magazine's annual awards ceremony, the awards moved onto the web with CVG.com in 1999. In April 1983, the magazine published the results of its first Golden Joystick Awards, along with pictures from the ceremony in Berkeley Square. DJ Dave Lee Travis presented the award for best game of the year to Jetpac. The 2006 Golden Joystick awards attracted over 540,000 votes and were webcast for the first time. The Golden Joystick Awards entered their 25th Silver Anniversary year in 2007 and attracted over 750,000 votes from gamers around the world, with Microsoft's Gears of War winning four Joysticks including Ultimate Game of the Year.

Early life Gully was born at Wick, near Bath, the son of an innkeeper who became a butcher in Bath shortly after John's birth. Gully worked for his father and inherited the business on his father's death. In 1805 the business failed and as a result, Gully was imprisoned for debt. Boxing Gully was visited in prison by a friend, Henry Pearce, a well-known prize fighter who was nicknamed \\"the Game Chicken\\". An informal match was arranged between them, which took place in the prison; as a result, Gully's debts were settled. On 8 October 1805, Gully was again matched against Henry Pearce, before the Duke of Clarence (later William IV of the United Kingdom) and numerous other spectators. After fighting twenty eight rounds, which occupied an hour and seventeen minutes, he was beaten. In 1807, he twice fought Bob Gregson, the Lancashire Giant, for two hundred guineas a side, winning on both occasions. The foremost prizefighting reporter of the period, Pierce Egan, recorded their battle of 14 October 1807:David Snowdon, Writing the Prizefight: Pierce Egan's Boxiana World (Bern, 2013) :‘Gregson’s strength was manifest to his opponent, who endeavoured to ward off its potent effects by his thorough knowledge of the science, and Gulley put in another dreadful facer, which made the claret fly in all directions, when Gregson fell' (Boxiana, vol. I) Horse racing Gully became the landlord of the Plough Tavern in Carey Street, London. He retired from the ring in 1808, and took to horse-racing. In 1827 he lost £40,000 by backing his horse Mameluke (for which he had paid four thousand guineas) for the St. Leger Stakes. In partnership with Robert Ridsdale, in 1832, he made £85,000 by winning The Derby and St Leger with St. Giles and Margrave. In 1844 in partnership with John Day, Gully won the 2,000 Guineas with Ugly Buck, and two years later he took the Derby and The Oaks with Pyrrhus The First and Mendicant. In 1854 he won the Two Thousand Guineas with Hermit, and in the same year, in partnership with Henry Padwick, the Derby with Andover. Political and business interests Having bought Ackworth Park near Pontefract, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for the Pontefract constituency from December 1832 to July 1837. In 1862 he purchased the Wingate Grange estate and collieries. A street in Wingate, County Durham is named after him. Gully died at Durham on 9 March 1863 aged 79. His body was returned to Ackworth where he was interred with his daughter. Family Gully was twice married and had twelve children by each wife. His daughter Mary married Thomas Pedley. Their son was engineer and cricketer William Pedley. John Gully in fiction Gully makes a notable appearance in Royal Flash, in George MacDonald Fraser's The Flashman Papers series of books, and was played by Henry Cooper in the 1975 film version.

In the 2011 census, it had around 290 houses and a population of 753. The village has very few amenities, but there is a primary school and a licensed social club run by a committee of members. There are three entrances to the village, two of which lead from the A1041 road between Selby and Camblesforth. The other entrance is a single-track road leading from the Selby bypass. The village's two nature reserves offer a network of paths and bridleways for woodland walks but neither allows horse riding. Barlow common also has a private fishing area and information centre. Before the 19th century, Barlow was usually known as ‘Berlay’ or ‘Barley’. Overview Barlow is an essentially rural village, situated about three miles from the town of Selby and from the motorway network. More recently the village could best be described as a dormitory village for commuters to Selby, York and Leeds. Barlow does not lead to anywhere along its main road. At the very end of the village is a roundabout and the Drax Nature Reserve. The services of the village are limited, with only the primary school and social club being the main amenities. Formally the village had a Post Office and Public House,Brown Cow Brewery, Barlow (2004). geograph.org.uk. Retrieved 4 February 2020 although both of these ceased to operate in the last century. The village has a mixed-use hall near the social club, being prominently used as a daytime nursery and gym. The village had a community church, which held weekly services and as well as services for the Primary school. It was closed by the parish of Brayton in 2012, due to the very small congregation coming to the weekly services. The vicar however still makes visits to the primary school, to celebrate important events in the Christian calendar.\\"Letter from the Rev Watson\\" (2012). Barlow Parish Council. Retrieved 4 February 2020 Barlow has its own bus services for schools and the public. Brayton Academy serves as the nearest secondary school and Selby has the nearest college. History Evidence of Barlow was first recorded in 1020, in a survey of the estates of the Archbishop of York. After the Norman Conquest, it was part of an estate centred on Drax manor. The only physical evidence of medieval settlement in Barlow is the earthworks around the present Barlow Hall farm. The furrow fields suggest that the area was in use around the time of the Norman Conquest, as the settlement was recorded in the Domesday Book as \\"Berlai\\". In 1520, London gentry family the Thompsons purchased the lands and built the Hall and later village church in the 16th century. The population grew during the industrial period and the main layout of Barlow was erected around this time. Much of the present housing was built in the last century. The village was the site of an airship production factory in the early part of the 20th century. Established by Whitworth & Co Ltd, it was responsible for the construction of the 25r, R29 and R33 during the First World War. However, in the aftermath of the war, the site became disused and the factory closed being replaced by a munitions depot in 1930. When Drax power station began construction in 1967 the supply depot was discontinued by the Ministry of Defence. The site had been mostly demolished by the late 1970s and all remains of now lie under the ash tip of Barlow Mound.Vikings, airships and ash: the history of Barlow Mound Retrieved 29 October 2018 Barlow Railway Station facing west In 1912, the NER established the Selby-Goole railway line which ran through the current nature reserve down to the merry-go-rounds at Drax. It enabled the construction of the airship factory and later the ordnance depot. The station closed to passengers in 1964 but the line was still used by the depot; and for construction on Drax power station until 1983. The line was completely dismantled by 1986 and the nearby ballast tip was replaced by Barlow Common. It was declared a local nature reserve in March 2002.

Commander David Glasgow Farragut and Captain Percival Drayton, chief of staff, stand on the deck of the Hartford, after the victory in Mobile Bay, August, 1864. Percival Drayton was appointed a midshipman in the Navy in December 1827 and initially served in the south Atlantic on board the frigate . He attained the rank of Lieutenant in February 1838 and had assignments in the Mediterranean, Pacific, and Atlantic, as well as shore duty at the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., and at the New York Navy Yard. Promoted to Commander in September 1855, Drayton subsequently served as a staff officer during the Paraguay Expedition. At the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, he was stationed at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where he directed the construction and renovation of ships for war service. In the fall of 1861, Commander Drayton was placed in command of the gunboat ; he participated in the capture of Port Royal, South Carolina. His older brother Thomas F. Drayton, a graduate of West Point and classmate of Jefferson Davis, had resigned with the secession of South Carolina. He was a general of the Confederate army and commanded the forts destroyed in this engagement. Percival Drayton became commanding officer of the sloop of war and was active in inshore operations in the waters of South Carolina, Georgia and northern Florida through the summer of 1862. He was promoted to Captain in July of that year. In September 1862, he was given command of the ironclad , overseeing her outfitting and working with John Ericsson to improve elements of monitor design. Drayton commanded his ship in attacks on Forts McAllister and Sumter in March and April 1863, experiences that reinforced his opinion concerning the limitations of the monitor type when fighting against well-defended fortifications. Captain Drayton's next assignment was as Superintendent of Ordnance at the New York Navy Yard. In December 1863 he began a year as Fleet Captain to the commander of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, Rear Admiral David Glasgow Farragut. Also commanding the squadron flagship, the big sloop of war , he took part in the August 1864 Battle of Mobile Bay and the following operations within Mobile Bay. Appointed Chief of the Bureau of Navigation in late April 1865, Drayton died of an obstructed bowel in Washington, D.C., on 4 August 1865 and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Namesakes The U.S. Navy has named two destroyers in honor of Percival Drayton, including: Drayton (Destroyer # 23, later DD-23) of 1910-1935; and of 1936-1946.

Cutting an object into slices creates many parallel cross-sections. The boundary of a cross-section in three-dimensional space that is parallel to two of the axes, that is, parallel to the plane determined by these axes, is sometimes referred to as a contour line; for example, if a plane cuts through mountains of a raised-relief map parallel to the ground, the result is a contour line in two- dimensional space showing points on the surface of the mountains of equal elevation. In technical drawing a cross-section, being a projection of an object onto a plane that intersects it, is a common tool used to depict the internal arrangement of a 3-dimensional object in two dimensions. It is traditionally crosshatched with the style of crosshatching often indicating the types of materials being used. With computed axial tomography, computers can construct cross-sections from x-ray data. Definition If a plane intersects a solid (a 3-dimensional object), then the region common to the plane and the solid is called a cross-section of the solid. A plane containing a cross-section of the solid may be referred to as a cutting plane. The shape of the cross-section of a solid may depend upon the orientation of the cutting plane to the solid. For instance, while all the cross-sections of a ball are disks,in more technical language, the cross-sections of a 3-ball are 2-balls the cross-sections of a cube depend on how the cutting plane is related to the cube. If the cutting plane is perpendicular to a line joining the centers of two opposite faces of the cube, the cross-section will be a square, however, if the cutting plane is perpendicular to a diagonal of the cube joining opposite vertices, the cross-section can be either a point, a triangle or a hexagon. Plane sections A related concept is that of a plane section, which is the curve of intersection of a plane with a surface. Thus, a plane section is the boundary of a cross-section of a solid in a cutting plane. If a surface in a three-dimensional space is defined by a function of two variables, i.e., , the plane sections by cutting planes that are parallel to a coordinate plane (a plane determined by two coordinate axes) are called level curves or isolines. More specifically, cutting planes with equations of the form (planes parallel to the -plane) produce plane sections that are often called contour lines in application areas. Mathematical examples of cross sections and plane sections Colored regions are cross-sections of the solid cone. Their boundaries (in black) are the named plane sections. A cross section of a polyhedron is a polygon. The conic sections – circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas – are plane sections of a cone with the cutting planes at various different angles, as seen in the diagram at left. Any cross- section passing through the center of an ellipsoid forms an elliptic region, while the corresponding plane sections are ellipses on its surface. These degenerate to disks and circles, respectively, when the cutting planes are perpendicular to a symmetry axis. In more generality, the plane sections of a quadric are conic sections. Cross-section of a solid cylinder A cross-section of a solid right circular cylinder extending between two bases is a disk if the cross-section is parallel to the cylinder's base, or an elliptic region (see diagram at right) if it is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the base. If the cutting plane is perpendicular to the base it consists of a rectangle (not shown) unless it is just tangent to the cylinder, in which case it is a single line segment. The term cylinder can also mean the lateral surface of a solid cylinder (see Cylinder (geometry)). If a cylinder is used in this sense, the above paragraph would read as follows: A plane section of a right circular cylinder of finite lengththese cylinders are open, they do not contain their bases is a circle if the cutting plane is perpendicular to the cylinder's axis of symmetry, or an ellipse if it is neither parallel nor perpendicular to that axis. If the cutting plane is parallel to the axis the plane section consists of a pair of parallel line segments unless the cutting plane is tangent to the cylinder, in which case, the plane section is a single line segment. A plane section can be used to visualize the partial derivative of a function with respect to one of its arguments, as shown. Suppose . In taking the partial derivative of with respect to , one can take a plane section of the function at a fixed value of to plot the level curve of solely against ; then the partial derivative with respect to is the slope of the resulting two-dimensional graph. In related subjects A plane section of a probability density function of two random variables in which the cutting plane is at a fixed value of one of the variables is a conditional density function of the other variable (conditional on the fixed value defining the plane section). If instead the plane section is taken for a fixed value of the density, the result is an iso-density contour. For the normal distribution, these contours are ellipses. In economics, a production function specifies the output that can be produced by various quantities and of inputs, typically labor and physical capital. The production function of a firm or a society can be plotted in three-dimensional space. If a plane section is taken parallel to the -plane, the result is an isoquant showing the various combinations of labor and capital usage that would result in the level of output given by the height of the plane section. Alternatively, if a plane section of the production function is taken at a fixed level of —that is, parallel to the -plane—then the result is a two-dimensional graph showing how much output can be produced at each of various values of usage of one input combined with the fixed value of the other input . Also in economics, a cardinal or ordinal utility function gives the degree of satisfaction of a consumer obtained by consuming quantities and of two goods. If a plane section of the utility function is taken at a given height (level of utility), the two-dimensional result is an indifference curve showing various alternative combinations of consumed amounts and of the two goods all of which give the specified level of utility. Area and volume Cavalieri's principle states that solids with corresponding cross-sections of equal areas have equal volumes. The cross- sectional area (A') of an object when viewed from a particular angle is the total area of the orthographic projection of the object from that angle. For example, a cylinder of height h and radius r has A' = \\\\pi r^2 when viewed along its central axis, and A' = 2 rh when viewed from an orthogonal direction. A sphere of radius r has A' = \\\\pi r^2 when viewed from any angle. More generically, A' can be calculated by evaluating the following surface integral: : A' = \\\\iint \\\\limits_\\\\mathrm{top} d\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{r}}, where \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{r}} is the unit vector pointing along the viewing direction toward the viewer, d\\\\mathbf{A} is a surface element with an outward-pointing normal, and the integral is taken only over the top-most surface, that part of the surface that is \\"visible\\" from the perspective of the viewer. For a convex body, each ray through the object from the viewer's perspective crosses just two surfaces. For such objects, the integral may be taken over the entire surface (A) by taking the absolute value of the integrand (so that the \\"top\\" and \\"bottom\\" of the object do not subtract away, as would be required by the Divergence Theorem applied to the constant vector field \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{r}}) and dividing by two: : A' = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\iint \\\\limits_A  d\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{r}}  In higher dimensions  In analogy with the cross-section of a solid, the cross-section of an -dimensional body in an -dimensional space is the non-empty intersection of the body with a hyperplane (an -dimensional subspace). This concept has sometimes been used to help visualize aspects of higher dimensional spaces. For instance, if a four-dimensional object passed through our three- dimensional space, we would see a three-dimensional cross-section of the four- dimensional object. In particular, a 4-ball (hypersphere) passing through 3-space would appear as a 3-ball that increased to a maximum and then decreased in size during the transition. This dynamic object (from the point of view of 3-space) is a sequence of cross-sections of the 4-ball.

Pinus taeda cross-section showing annual rings, Cheraw, South Carolina. In geology, the structure of the interior of a planet is often illustrated using a diagram of a cross-section of the planet that passes through the planet's center, as in the cross-section of Earth at right. Cross-sections are often used in anatomy to illustrate the inner structure of an organ, as shown at the left. A cross- section of a tree trunk, as shown at left, reveals growth rings that can be used to find the age of the tree and the temporal properties of its environment.

Green trained under Robert Hancock, a Worcester engraver, after which he moved to London and began working as a mezzotint engraver. He began to exhibit with the Incorporated Society of Artists from 1766, became a fellow a year later and a director in 1771. He was appointed mezzotint engraver to the king in 1773, and the following year was elected an associate engraver with the Royal Academy. Throughout the 1770s and 1780s, Green's engraving practice flourished. In the 1790s, however, several of his international speculations failed and in 1798 he was declared bankrupt. In 1805 he accepted the role of keeper of the British Institution, a post he held until his death. Biography Born in Salford Priors, he was placed by his father in a solicitor's office at Evesham, where he remained for two years; but ultimately he decided, on his own responsibility, to abandon the legal profession and became a pupil of a line engraver at Worcester. In 1765 he migrated to London and began work as a mezzotint engraver, having taught himself the technicalities of this art, and quickly rose to a position in absolutely the front rank of British engravers. On first coming to London he published in collaboration with the Aquatint engraver Francis Jukes. Portrait of the Ladies Waldegrave, mezzotint after Joshua Reynolds He became a member of the Incorporated Society of Artists in 1767, an associate-engraver of the Royal Academy in 1775, and for some forty years he followed his profession with the greatest success. The exclusive right of engraving and publishing plates from the pictures in the Düsseldorf gallery was granted him by the duke of Bavaria in 1789, but, after he had issued more than twenty of these plates, the siege of that city by the French put an end to this undertaking and caused him serious financial loss. From this cause, and through the failure of certain other speculations, he was reduced to poverty; and in consequence he took the post of keeper of the British Institution in 1805, and continued in this office for the remainder of his life. During his career as an engraver he produced some four hundred plates after portraits by Reynolds, Romney, and other British artists, after the compositions of Benjamin West, and after pictures by Van Dyck, Rubens, Murillo, and other old masters. It is claimed for him that he was one of the first engravers to show how admirably mezzotint could be applied to the translation of pictorial compositions as well as portraits, but at the present time it is to his portraits that most attention is given by collectors. His engravings are distinguished by exceptional richness and subtlety of tone, and by very judicious management of relations of light and shade; and they have, almost without exception, notable freshness and grace of handling. James Walker (c.1748-c.1808) was one of Green's pupils. The Antiquarian A keen Antiquarian, he was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, in London. He published at least three works. The first was a \\"Survey of the City of Worcester\\", published in 1764, compiled during his residence there. Printed by J. Butler for S.Gamidge, at Prior's Head, Worcester. This formed the groundwork for his second book \\"the History and antiquities of the City and Suburbs of Worcester\\", published as two volumes on 3 April 1796. Printed for the author by W.Bulmer and Co. and sold by G.Nicol of London. His third work was \\"An Account of the Discovery of the Body of King John: In the Cathedral Church of Worcester\\", published by V. and R.

In Connecticut, the incumbent governor's party is listed on top of the ballot. Despite being far outspent by her rivals, Groark won nearly, but not quite, 20 percent of the vote in a five-way race. Rowland won with 36 percent. Democrat Curry came in second with 33% while anti-income tax, independent-conservative Tom Scott came in fourth with 11%. Another third-party candidate came in last with 1 percent. Because Groark failed to gain 20 percent of the vote to retain major party status for the ACP, its influence ended in Connecticut politics. Some Democrats, Curry among them,http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc- xpm-2001-08-26-0108260037-story.html blamed Groark for siphoning votes from Curry and throwing the election to Rowland. On the other end of the spectrum, Jonathan Pelto, a former political director of the Connecticut Democratic Party, told The New York Times that had Scott not been on the ballot, it would have been a landslide victory for Rowland.https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/nyregion/1994-elections- connecticut-governor-now-comes-hardest-part-repealing-that.html Groark's support was heaviest in suburban and rural towns in northern Connecticut.

Discovered in 1878 by Édouard Stephan using the reflector at Marseille Observatory, it is one of the smallest planetary nebulae and by far the most extensively studied. Overview NGC 7027 is one of the visually brightest planetary nebulae. It is about 600 years old. It is unusually small, measuring only 0.2 by 0.1 light-years, whereas the typical size for a planetary nebula is 1 light-year. It has a very complex shape, consisting of an elliptical region of ionized gas within a massive neutral cloud. The inner structure is surrounded by a translucent shroud of gas and dust. The nebula is shaped like a prolate ellipsoidal shell and contains a photodissociation region shaped like a \\"clover leaf\\". NGC 7027 is expanding at . The central regions of NGC 7027 have been found to emit X-rays, indicating very high temperatures. Surrounding the ellipsoidal nebula are a series of faint, blue concentric shells. It is possible that the central white dwarf of NGC 7027 has an accretion disk that acts as a source of high temperatures. The white dwarf is believed to have a mass approximately 0.7 times the mass of the Sun and is radiating at 7,700 times the Sun's luminosity. NGC 7027 is currently in a short phase of planetary nebula evolution in which molecules in its envelope are being dissociated into their component atoms, and the atoms are being ionized. The expanding halo of NGC 7027 has a mass of about three times the mass of the Sun, and is about 100 times more massive than the ionized central region. This mass loss in NGC 7027 provided important evidence that stars a few times more massive than the Sun can avoid being destroyed in supernova explosions. NGC 7027 has a rich and highly ionized spectrum caused by its hot central star. The nebula is rich in carbon, and is a very interesting object for the study of carbon chemistry in dense molecular material exposed to strong ultraviolet radiation. The spectrum of NGC 7027 contains fewer spectral lines from neutral molecules than is usual for planetary nebulae. This is due to the destruction of neutral molecules by intense UV radiation. The nebula contains ions of extremely high ionization potential. The helium hydride ion, thought to be the earliest molecule to have been formed in the Universe (about 100,000 years after the Big Bang), was detected in 2019 for the first time in space in NGC 7027. There is also evidence for the presence of nanodiamond in NGC 7027. It has been photographed multiple times by the Hubble Space Telescope since its launch in 1990. Prior to these observations, NGC 7027 was thought to be a proto-planetary nebula with the central star too cool to ionize any of the gas, but it is now known to be a planetary nebula in the earliest stage of its development. The progenitor star is believed to have been about 3 to 4 times the mass of the Sun before the nebula was formed. In 1977 at Yerkes Observatory, a small Schmidt telescope was used to derive an accurate optical position for the planetary nebula NGC 7027 to allow comparison between photographs and radio maps of the object. In a 6\\" telescope at around 50× it appears as a relatively bright bluish star. It is best viewed with the highest magnification possible.

Hugh Reginald Haweis (3 April 1838 – 29 January 1901) was an English cleric and writer. He was the husband of author Mary Eliza Haweis and the father of painter Stephen Haweis. Biography The Reverend H.R. Haweis was born in Egham, Surrey in 1838, the son of the Rev. John Oliver Willyams Haweis of Brighton, Canon of Chichester. He was educated privately in Sussex and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1860. He travelled in Italy and served under Garibaldi in 1860. On his return to England he was ordained and held various curacies in London, becoming in 1866 incumbent of St James's, Marylebone. HR Haweis His unconventional methods of conducting the service, combined with his dwarfish figure and lively manner, soon attracted crowded congregations. He married Mary E. Joy in 1866, and both he and Mrs Haweis (d. 1898) contributed largely to periodical literature and travelled a good deal abroad. Haweis was Lowell lecturer in Boston, in 1885, and represented the Anglican Church at the Chicago Parliament of Religions in 1893. He was much interested in music, and wrote books on violins and church bells, besides contributing an article to the 9th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica on “bell”. His best-known book was Music and Morals (1871), which went through sixteen editions before the end of the century, and he was for a time from 1868 editor of Cassell's Magazine. He also wrote the five-volume Christ and Christianity, a popular church history (1886–1887), as well as Travel and Talk (1896) and similar chatty and entertaining books. His book My Musical LifeH.R. Haweis, My Musical Life (W.H. Allen, London 1884). offers a biographical tour through his career and his spiritual leanings in music, tracing his awakening to music, his interest in the Cremonese violin makers and in Paganini, an exposition of The Ring of the Nibelungen, Parsifal, Lohengrin and Tannhäuser, and anecdotes of his meetings with Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt.

It was first published by EMAP in October 1988 and initially covered computer games aimed at the Atari ST, Commodore Amiga, and IBM PC markets. Like many similar magazines, it contained sections of news, game reviews, previews, tips, help guides, columnist writings, readers' letters, and cover-mounted disks of game demos. The magazine was sometimes criticised for including \\"filler\\" content such as articles on Arnold Schwarzenegger with the justification that an upcoming film had a computer game tie-in. Readers also initially had trouble buying the magazine due to the name; The One lead to confusion among newsagents over exactly which magazine they meant. History In 1988 the 16-bit computer scene was beginning to emerge. With Commodore's Amiga and Atari's ST starting to gain more and more coverage in the multi format titles, EMAP decided it was time for a dedicated magazine aimed at the user of these 16-bit computers. The One for 16-Bit Games was launched and covered the Atari ST, Amiga, and PC games market.The One for 16-bit Games #1 (1988-Oct) Produced by editor Gary Penn and a small team of contributors, the magazine went on to gain a circulation figures of over 40,000 readers. The industry voted The One for 16-Bit Games \\"Magazine of the Year\\" in February 1990. In June 1990, the magazine was extensively redesigned. Some regular features were dropped, the layout was changed, and the logo changed slightly to more emphasize ONE. The magazine was subtitled \\"For Amiga, Atari ST and PC Games\\".The One #21 (1990-Jun) The ST and Amiga had reached a larger market by 1991 and there were dozens of single format magazines catering to these users. Because of this EMAP, along with recently appointed editor Ciarán Brennan, made the decision to split the magazine into The One for Amiga Games starting May 1991The One for Amiga Games #32 (1991-May) and The One for ST Games. PC games coverage was transferred to the recently launched PC Leisure. 1991 was the start of the high-water mark of 16-bit gaming. The 8-bit computers were fading away and gamers were moving over to the faster and more powerful 16-bit formats. Because many features fell into the general computing category, content remained similar between the two magazines. Because both magazines were produced by the same production team, the magazines resembled one another. However a few months later both titles would move in their own directions, catering for platform specific games. In 1992 EMAP was reorganizing their games magazines. Mean Machines was split into two, The One for ST Games was incorporated into Europress's ST Action, and ACE magazine closed. ACE magazine closing meant that there was a well-respected team available. To give the magazine a new direction and look, the original staff were moved and the ACE writers took their place. The change of The One was evident with magazines' relaunch. The new editor Jim Douglas and his team produced the new magazine from May 1992, with its shortened logo THE ONE, with the subtitle \\"Incorporating all the best of ACE\\".The One #44 (1992-May) As the subtitle suggested, the magazine layout and content was essentially The One with some of the content of ACE, together producing an entirely new magazine. Just months after the redesign, most of the staff moved on and David Upchurch took over editorship. Again, the magazine put the word \\"Amiga\\" in its title starting October 1992.The One Amiga #49 (1992-Oct) Now called The One Amiga, this would allow potential readers to recognize the magazine as an Amiga title. The staples were also replaced in favour of a spine bound magazine. There were many significant changes to the Amiga market in 1993. More coverage was given to games that were A1200 specific and there was the launch of the 32-bit Amiga CD32. All formats were accommodated within the magazine by way of the details box which indicated what specification the game was designed for. In March 1994, David Upchurch announced that this would be his last issue. Deputy Editor, Simon Byron, stepped up to replace him. Just eight issues later and the cycle repeated itself, Simon Byron left and, then Deputy Editor, Andy Nuttall replaced him. Despite the new editorship and optimism the magazine page count decreased to 84. In July 1995 it was announced that EMAP was closing the magazine down. The One content was incorporated into EMAP's other Amiga title, CU Amiga. This was not the end of The One magazine as Maverick Magazines bought the title and launched their first edition in August 1995.The One Amiga: Maverick Edition #82 (1995-Aug) This version, dubbed The One Amiga: Maverick Edition, had a different content. It looked like The One but it lacked the former writing style and spirit of the EMAP team. The magazine quickly decreased to a pamphlet style magazine of just 16 pages before ceasing with the final issue of July 1996.

Simpson murder case. Early life and education Kaelin was born on March 9, 1959, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Kaelin was nicknamed \\"Kato\\" as a child after the character played by Bruce Lee on the television series The Green Hornet.Brian \\"Kato\\" Kaelin He graduated from Nicolet High School in Glendale, Wisconsin, in 1977. He attended, but never graduated from, the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire. He pledged SAE Fraternity in the fall of 1980 and was accepted at the end of the term at California State University, Fullerton. During his time at Eau Claire he created his own talk show, Kato and Friends, and hosted The Gameshow on the campus television station, TV10. He eventually moved to Hollywood.  O. J. Simpson murder case  Kaelin was a minor witness for the prosecution in the 1995 O. J. Simpson murder case. In 1994, he was staying in a guest house on Simpson's Rockingham estate and was present at the compound on the night of the two murders on June 12. He witnessed some of Simpson's movements before and after the time of the murders. His story seemed to contradict Simpson's version of the events on some key points, as he testified that he could not account for Simpson's whereabouts between 9:36 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on the evening the murders took place, which the prosecution alleged occurred between 10:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. In spite of \\"valuable evidence\\" provided by Kaelin in his testimony, prosecutor Marcia Clark took the unusual step of having him declared a hostile witness, \\"allowing her to attack her own prosecution witness without repeated objections from Simpson's defense team.\\" He received considerable media attention during the trial; one survey found that 74 percent of Americans could identify him, compared to 25 percent for Vice President Al Gore. Landmark libel case After Simpson was acquitted, the cover of an issue of the tabloid newspaper National Examiner featured a photo of Kaelin without his shirt on, with the headline \\"Cops think Kato did it!\\" The article within the issue alleged that police suspected Kaelin of perjury. Kaelin sued the publisher, Globe Communications, for libel, alleging that the cover headline implied he was suspected of the murders. The federal District Court for Central California dismissed the case, saying the story was not libelous or malicious. This was reversed by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled: The decision was a landmark case in libel law, finding that a headline could be considered libel. Kaelin later settled the US$15 million lawsuit with Globe Communications out of court. Career Before his involvement in the O. J. Simpson trial, Kaelin appeared in the movie Beach Fever (1987), in which his character created a love potion with his friend and hit on girls at the beach; he also starred in Night Shadow (1989), a low budget horror movie. Kaelin briefly made national headlines when he said he never told the New York Post columnist Cindy Adams that Simpson definitely killed his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. He said he has expressed his opinion before, that he thinks Simpson did it, but \\"I have no firsthand knowledge.\\" Soon after the trial, Kaelin appeared on the first episode of the Fox sketch comedy MADtv (October 1995) and made a cameo appearance on the HBO sketch comedy Mr. Show with Bob and David during the series' first season (November 1995); in the latter series' episode titled \\"We Regret to Inform You\\", he shows up at lobotomized actor Borden Grote's party. He appeared in the feature film The Still Life (2006) and had a minor role in National Lampoon's Dorm Daze 2 (2006). In February 2009, Kaelin guest-starred in the web series Star-ving and the movie Whacked. He was a guest on Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher, on March 29, 1995. Kaelin has made numerous forays into reality television. In 2002, he participated in the series Celebrity Boot Camp. In 2004, he participated in the development of a reality show called House Guest, in which he would live in other celebrities' homes; that show never aired. He was seen on an episode of the E! reality series Sunset Tan, asking specifically for a \\"farmer's tan\\". He was also a guest player on the sixth episode of the Comedy Central series Reality Bites Back. In 2008, he was a contestant in the Fox Reality Channel show Gimme My Reality Show, in which minor celebrities competed to receive their own reality show. Kaelin has also participated in game shows. He appeared on the NBC version of The Weakest Link (2002). He was a contestant on the game shows Russian Roulette as well as the reality dating show BZZZ! hosted by Annie Wood. In 2005, he appeared in the first three National Lampoon's Strip Poker pay-per-view programs (Kaelin is an avid poker player); the titles were filmed at Hedonism II, a naturist resort in Negril, Jamaica, which led him to quip, \\"The first few days there were the hardest!\\" The Playboy bunnies, WWE Divas, and pin-up models competing in the no-limit Texas hold 'em games, and upon losing all their chips and clothes, had to dive into the \\"Pool of Shame\\" and visit \\"Kato's Guesthouse\\", where he would interview the nude defeated players. He also appeared in numerous comedic skits. Kaelin also has worked as a radio and television host. For a short time in 1995, he worked as a radio talk host on KLSX in Los Angeles, and provided online content for National Lampoon. From June 2005 to some time in 2006, Kaelin co-hosted Eye for an Eye, a daytime TV court show syndicated in 34 countries. Kaelin was a recurring guest on the video game review show X-Play. Kaelin has also appeared in several parodies. In 2009, he was seen on the series Tosh.0, in a parody of the Keyboard Cat video titled \\"Keyboard Kato\\". And in 2010, Kaelin appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher, wearing a wig to play his younger self in a taped skit parodying 1990s television appearances by 2010 US senatorial candidate Christine O'Donnell. Since 2011, Kaelin has hosted the TV talk show Tailgating with Kato. In 2016, he made a brief appearance on the FX comedy series Baskets, where he performed the national anthem at a rodeo. In 2016, Kaelin appeared in the Troma Entertainment film B.C. Butcher.http://io9.gizmodo.com/tromas-latest-horror- comedy-bc-butcher-was-directed-b-1751414096 In 2019, Kaelin was a house guest in the second American season of the reality show competition Celebrity Big Brother. He was evicted by a 5-0 vote on February 4, 2019, finishing in 8th place out of 12 house guests. Personal life Kaelin was best friends with the actor and comedian Norm Macdonald from mid-2000 to mid-2001, according to Macdonald's The Norm Show co-star Artie Lange. He was even given a guest role on the show. He and Macdonald had a falling out which ended their friendship. Kaelin was married to Cynthia Coulter from 1983 to 1989.

Biography Born in Hasselfelde, he first came to public notice in 1931, when he began to work on the problem of transporting mail by rocket. In 1933 he performed several experiments in the Harz and at Cuxhaven. In 1934, he emigrated to the UK, where he attempted to interest the British government in his rocket. After a failed rocket demonstration for officials of the British Royal Mail on July 31, 1934, he was deported to Germany, where he was arrested on suspicion of cooperating with the British. During World War II he served in the Luftwaffe. After World War II, he moved across the border to West Germany, to the part of the Harz in Lower Saxony, where he became a furniture dealer. He continued his rocket experiments until, at a rocket demonstration on May 7, 1964 on the Hasselkopf Mountain near Braunlage, an accident occurred which killed three people. This accident led to a ban on civilian rocket research in West Germany, ending the rocket experiments of the Hermann-Oberth-Gesellschaft (Hermann Oberth Society) and the Berthold Seliger Forschungs- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH (Berhold Seliger Research and Development Society). In the 1970s Gerhard Zucker once again began launching mail rockets. Zucker in popular culture A movie based on Zucker's attempts with mail rockets at Scarp was made in 2004, called The Rocket Post, starring Ulrich Thomsen as Zucker. In October 2011, Canadian Wilfred Ashley McIsaac resurrected the Zucker legacy in eastern Ontario, Canada after launching a scale solid fuel ARCAS rocket with Gerhard Zucker 'First Canadian Rocket- Flight' stamps on board. Zucker himself produced the postal stamps for a May 1936 exhibit in New York City. The stamps were never used until McIsaac launched them 75 years later on October 31, 2011.

Early life and education Graham was born in Mexico City, Mexico on August 19, 1938, to Roberto Pena and Adelina Graham. Roberto Pena died when his son was six years old, and the boy, his mother Adelina, his grandmother Ana, and his aunt Mercedes left Mexico and moved to San Jose, California. Robert Graham received his formal art training at San Jose State University and the San Francisco Art Institute.LA Times, obituary He continued his studies at the San Francisco Art Institute in California, finishing in 1964. Career By the late 1960s, Graham had one-man exhibitions of his sculpture at important contemporary art galleries in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, New York City, London, Cologne, and Essen, Germany. He, along with family members Joey and Steven, lived in London for a period before settling in Los Angeles in the early 1970s. His first solo exhibition in a museum was at the Dallas Museum of Art in 1972. Since then he has had dozens of one-man shows, including several at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Graham used a range of materials and scales in his work. In the 1970s he created very small wax sculptures (circa ) in miniature dioramas, depicting people interacting in various contemporary environments, such as a living room or a beach scene. Some of these interactions included sexual congress. Graham's 1986 monument to the boxer Joe Louis is a bronze fist and forearm. He has created hundreds of nude figures and groupings in intermediate scales. Graham's first major monumental commission was the ceremonial gateway for the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, for the occasion of the 1984 Olympics. He also designed the commemorative silver dollar for the event. The gateway featured two bronze torsos, male and female, modeled on contestants in the games. The gateway was a major design element of an Olympiad noted for its lack of new construction. To the surprise of many, the nudity of the torsos became an issue in the media.When Everyone Giggled at the LA Coliseum's Headless Nudes After 1984, Graham received many other commissions for monumental works, such as The Great Bronze Doors of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles (2002). Personal life Graham married his first wife Joey Graham in 1959. They have one son, Steven, born in 1963. He married actress Anjelica Huston in 1992,CBC Graham Obituary and they resided in an unusual dwelling in Venice, Los Angeles. Huston refused to move to the bohemian area unless Graham built them a fortress to live in. The result was a giant, windowless structure behind an opaque 40-foot fence. Graham made a cameo appearance in Huston's movie, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, as the Venezuelan general near the beginning of the film standing on the deck of the ship. Wes Anderson mentions in the movie's commentary that Graham has some aspects in common with Steve Zissou. Honors In 1983, Graham was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver announced on May 28, 2008 that Graham would be inducted into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts. The induction ceremony took place on December 15, 2008 but he was too ill to attend. His son Steven accepted the award on his behalf as he was inducted alongside 11 other legendary Californians. Death After an illness of about six months, Graham died on December 27, 2008 at Santa Monica – UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles. His funeral was held at Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, which has bronze doors that Graham created for the cathedral. His remains are interred at Woodlawn Cemetery, Mortuary & Mausoleum.

Also known as D-Plan or The Plan, the name came from a stray phrase uttered by insurance salesman Ned Ryerson in the popular comedy Groundhog Day.Hearon, Liza. An Interview with Travis Morrison of The Dismemberment Plan Retrieved on October 6, 2006. The band members included Eric Axelson (bass), Jason Caddell (guitar), Joe Easley (drums), and Travis Morrison (vocals and guitar). Axelson, Caddell, Morrison and original drummer Steve Cummings formed the band in college, knowing each other from attending northern Virginia high schools (Axelson, Cummings, and Morrison attended Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke, Virginia). Cummings left the band after the recording of their debut album ! and was replaced by Easley, cementing the band's lineup. The Dismemberment Plan released four albums before breaking up in 2003, the best known being 1999's critically acclaimed Emergency & I. They reunited in early 2011, touring the US and Japan and releasing a live album. A comeback album, Uncanney Valley, was released on October 15, 2013. Band history Aside from a brief interlude in 1998 and 1999 when they were signed by Interscope Records, the band recorded for the Washington, D.C independent label DeSoto Records. Their breakthrough album, Emergency & I, was actually created during their time at Interscope. However, they were dropped from the label shortly after its completion, and thus took it back with them to DeSoto, where it wound up being released. The EP The Ice of Boston is the only item of theirs Interscope actually released during their tenure there. The band managed to avoid being in debt to the label, effectively being able to record on a major label budget with no consequence. The band referred to their situation in a later interview as \\"slipping through the cracks\\". Following the massive underground success of Emergency & I, the band received an even higher profile after being invited to open for the European leg of Pearl Jam's 2000 tour. A co-headlining tour in 2002 with Death Cab for Cutie (called the \\"Death and Dismemberment Tour\\") also worked well to raise both bands' profiles and cross-pollinate their fanbases, as well as forge creative ties between several members. Later that summer and fall the Dismemberment Plan started to debut songs for their follow-up to 2001's Change. In 2002 the band put all the music tracks from their last two albums on their website, encouraging fans to remix the songs. The result was 2003's A People's History of the Dismemberment Plan. On January 19, 2003, however, the band announced on their website that they had decided to break up after a few tours that year. A final show was planned for July 28, 2003 in Washington D.C.'s famous outdoor show space, Fort Reno Park. However come show-time a heavy rain threatened to damage their electronic equipment and drove off all but the most devoted fans, leading the band to add one more final show. On September 1, 2003, they closed out their career with a sold-out show at the renowned 9:30 Club, dubbed the \\"one last slice\\" show. Morrison took the post-Change songs with him for further work, and released many of them on his first album, Travistan, released in 2004. Eric Axelson started a band called Maritime with former members of The Promise Ring. They released three albums: Glass Floor in 2004, We, the Vehicles in 2006, and Heresy and the Hotel Choir in 2007. On March 1, 2007, the band announced they would be playing a one-and-off reunion show on Saturday, April 28, 2007 at Washington D.C.'s venerable Black Cat nightclub. The event was a charity concert benefiting Callum Robbins, son of J. Robbins, frontman for DeSoto Records labelmate Jawbox. Fan reaction to the decision was overwhelmingly positive, and tickets to the concert sold out within minutes of being offered online. In response to the high demand for tickets, a second show was announced for April 27. Travis Morrison has stated that the band probably won't be getting back together, \\"except to drink beer\\". On September 13, 2010, The Washington Post Click Track reported that the band would reunite for a tour, in support of Barsuk Records' reissue of 1999's Emergency & I. \\"We're not planning a new record,\\" bassist Eric Axelson told Click Track. \\"But we're doing these shows and taking it day to day after that.\\" The 2011 tour kicked off with a performance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, followed by three Washington, D.C. shows (two at the 9:30 Club, one at the Black Cat) January 21–23. The band would play 10 more shows in 2011, including high- profile appearances at the Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago and the annual \\"Roots Picnic\\" in Philadelphia. In August 2012, wanting to play \\"a couple of small, sweaty summer shows like we used to do\\", the Dismemberment Plan played small-venue shows in Baltimore and Fredericksburg, Va where they debuted eight new songs. As of August 13, 2012, according to Travis Morrison, \\"We have a bunch more [new songs] coming so we're going back to the lab to work on brand new ones and tweak these. No plans for recording as of yet, although certainly those conversations are happening now.\\" Shortly thereafter, the band announced that they would be playing the Virgin FreeFest in October, along with two more accompanying shows. On July 16, 2013, the band shared \\"Waiting\\", a new song from the upcoming album, which could be heard by calling the number 252-64-DPLAN. On October 15, 2013, the band released Uncanney Valley on Partisan Records. In November 2013, the band played the final holiday camp edition of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in Camber Sands, England. Musical style 250px While drawing heavily from previous Washington-based art-punk acts such as Fugazi and Jawbox, the Dismemberment Plan are significant for incorporating R&B; (in stage banter, Morrison often talked of his obsession with Gladys Knight) and hip-hop influences to their sound. Influential indie rock criticism website Pitchfork Media has called them the fathers of the late-1990s/early-2000s dance-punk movement, which in turn fostered the current new wave revival. Ironic humor was also a major component of the band's aesthetic, as displayed in songs such as \\"The Dismemberment Plan Gets Rich\\" (Dismemberment Plan/Juno) and \\"The Ice of Boston\\" (...Is Terrified).

They formed in 1993 with lead vocalist Benjamin Kowalewicz, guitarist Ian D'Sa, bassist Jon Gallant, and drummer Aaron Solowoniuk. There have been no lineup changes, although Solowoniuk is currently taking a hiatus from the band due to an MS relapse, and Jordan Hastings from Alexisonfire, Cunter, and Say Yes is currently filling in for him. In the 25 years since their inception, Billy Talent has sold over 900,000 physical albums in Canada alone and nearly 3 million albums internationally. Between 1995 and 2016, Billy Talent were the 27th best-selling Canadian artist in Canada and among the top 10 best-selling Canadian bands in Canada. The band existed for almost a decade before mainstream success. The members met and played in Our Lady of Mount Carmel Secondary School under the name Pezz and remained underground in Toronto's indie music scene until 2001. The band renamed itself Billy Talent after running into legal trouble with the old name. It was then that Kowalewicz's connection with an employee of Warner Music Canada's A&R; department landed the band a record deal and launched them into mainstream success. Since then, Billy Talent has made three multi-platinum records in Canada and continues to expand their success overseas; this included touring for 20 months supporting their second album. They released their third album, Billy Talent III, on July 14, 2009, and their fourth album, Dead Silence, on September 4, 2012. Dead Silence was followed up by a full UK tour throughout October and November 2012. To commemorate the longevity since the release of their first studio album, the band has released a greatest hits album entitled Hits on November 4, 2014. In 2015, they began to prepare material for their fifth studio album. Just before entering the studio, drummer Aaron Solowoniuk decided to sit out the recording sessions while he continued his longstanding battle with multiple sclerosis. Fellow Canadian Jordan Hastings was quickly recruited to play as Solowoniuk's studio stand-in, and, in early 2016, the group completed work on Afraid of Heights, which was released in July of that year.  History = Origins as Pezz (1993–1999) It wasn't until the recording of Watoosh! that Kowalewicz and D'Sa started singing, \\"creating unique harmonies accented by the loud rock sound that the band was pumping out.\\" The band got together during a high school talent contest. Pezz began writing, performing songs, and gaining attention and credibility at first locally, and soon in Toronto's broader indie music scene. Their first recording was a cheap 4-track demo. It was recorded in Ian D'Sa's basement in July 1994 and was named Demoluca, after a friend of the band named Jason Deluca had stopped by the house, banging on a basement window while the band was recording. Soon after, on January 1995, they all put in money to record another demo of better quality with engineer/producer Dave Tedesco at the \\"Signal to Noise\\" studio which they called Dudebox.\\"Before They Were Famous\\". Originally, two tracks from Demoluca and four newly recorded tracks were compiled onto it, but a year later the band recorded four more tunes live in the studio and re-released it. After these releases and their continued performances in the immediate area, Pezz was gaining a following in Mississauga and it continued to spread.Bowman, Trevor. D'Sa studied classical animation at Sheridan College, and even worked on Angela Anaconda as an animator. Gallant almost finished a business degree. Kowalewicz was in between jobs, one which included working at 102.1 the edge. Solowoniuk worked at Chrysler Canada. But during this, each member found the time and finances to max-out their credit cards, and record their first full- length album in 1999. They laid down twelve tracks at a studio called \\"Great Big Music\\", collaborating with Juno-nominated music producer Brad Nelson. Kowalewicz started singing in melody with D'Sa. The music began to transform from \\"raw rap-rock\\" songs into \\"catchy and angst-ridden pop-punk anthems\\". With that, Watoosh! was born and independently released. While popular within Toronto's indie scene, it did not reach large mainstream sales levels.  Billy Talent and success (1999–2004)  In 1999, the Canadian Pezz received documentation from an American band named Pezz proving that the latter had held the name internationally since 1989. The Canadian band had no legal claim to their old name and thus changed it to Billy Talent, inspired by the guitarist \\"Billy Tallent\\" from Michael Turner's novel Hard Core Logo. The film adaptation by Bruce McDonald would be the inspirational medium for the band. This, however, still led to fans mistaking Kowalewicz as being named Billy Talent.Wood, Sherry. Now known as Billy Talent, their sound began to move in a more aggressive, punk rock direction. During this time, Kowalewicz ran into Jen Hirst, at 102.1 the edge, the Toronto radio station he worked at. She had seen the band perform as Pezz, and he asked her to check out the band's performance at a club. This would prove to pay off, as Hirst was later hired by Warner Music Canada to work in A&R.; This connection would get the band their producer Gavin Brown, and a demo deal with the label. Before the demos were recorded, a local manager called Atlantic Records A&R; executives, who were already in Toronto, to see the band perform in its tiny rehearsal space. 3x platinum in Canada. In 2002, the band met with record executives, and ended up signing a co-venture agreement with Atlantic Records and Warner Music Canada. In the fall of 2003, the band released their full-length self-titled album, Billy Talent. The album found considerable sales success. \\"Try Honesty\\" was a successful first single, and was followed by other singles \\"The Ex\\", \\"River Below\\", and \\"Nothing to Lose\\" into late 2003 and 2004. The band played sold-out shows in Canada and the United States and had success in Europe. The band received a Juno, (They won two Junos, Best Album of the Year, and Best Band of the Year) and MuchMusic Video Award nominations and awards, and spent late 2004 and most of 2005 touring. Billy Talent went on to be certified 3x platinum in Canada. A track from the album titled \\"This Is How It Goes\\" was about Aaron Solowoniuk's fight with multiple sclerosis. On March 17, 2006, Aaron Solowoniuk revealed in a personal letter to fans that he was the friend in that song. Solowoniuk was confirmed to have the disease, which causes anything from numbness in the limbs to paralysis or loss of vision, in January 1999. His neurologist prescribed him medication that he would have to self inject three times a week, possibly for the rest of his life. Although it was a struggle for Solowoniuk to come to terms with the reality of the disease, going to numerous doctor appointments and touring with a mini-fridge in their van has become a normal routine.  Billy Talent II (2005–2007)  Billy Talent's second album was mostly recorded at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia, which was produced by Gavin Brown again with Ian D'Sa co-producing for the first time, and mixed by Chris Lord-Alge. Billy Talent II hit the shelves on June 27, 2006. It fared very well in Canada in its debut week, landing in at number 1 on the Canadian charts.Armstrong, Denis. It also enjoyed significant success in Germany, where it also debuted at number 1 in the album charts in its debut week, and was one of the top 10 selling albums in the country.Bliss, Karen. As of June 15, 2007, the album has sold almost 700,000 units worldwide, 215,000 of them in Canada making it certified 2x Platinum, and 200,000 shipped units in Germany achieved it platinum status there.Brockdorff, Johann-Friedrich. However, the success did not duplicate itself in the U.S. The band has expressed that they know they are a new band there, and they are choosing to concentrate their attention on Canada, Europe, and other places overseas instead. Kowalewicz at the Cardiff University Students' Union on August 8, 2006. This was the band's second international tour, and played in countries like Finland, Norway, Luxembourg, and Belgium for the first time. The album contains less anger and profanity than their previous self-titled album, as they had mellowed out and matured as men and as a band. More of the songs dealt with real-life issues, to the praise of fans and critics. The band ventured off on another UK tour in support of Billy Talent II, but this one would include more shows in countries they had not performed in before. During this tour leg, the gigs at London and Manchester, on September 8 and 16, respectively, were recorded live. Limited edition CDs were released as the band's only live album to date, Live from the UK Sept./2006. Also during the tour, the band had to miss their Southampton show \\"due to a death in the family\\". The whole band returned the following month to play the show.

As of September 11, 2007, the band has indicated that their 18-month tour has officially ended, and they are \\"home for a while to catch [their] breath a little before [they] start writing the next record.\\"Said by Ben on the official message boards (July 1, 2008).

However, this evolved into a more collected sound that was a mix of fewer genres on their second album, Billy Talent. The result of this has not been described by the band as their defining sound and that it was something that appeared to them after experimenting with different styles. On Billy Talent II, the band altered their sound yet again, based on more mid-tempo and emotional compositions; a bit more collected than their previous work. It was also based on far less angst and aggression behind the production, things that were known factors behind their debut. In their music there are raw and frequent backup vocals heavily collaborated by main vocals, quick changes between loud and quiet, and Kowalewicz's characteristic vocals which are the key elements that emphasize that assertion.  Band members  * Benjamin Kowalewicz – lead vocals (1993–present) * Ian D'Sa – guitar, vocals, keyboards (1993–present) * Jonathan Gallant – bass guitar, backing vocals (1993–present) * Aaron Solowoniuk - drums, percussion (1993–present; on hiatus 2016–present) * Jordan Hastings – drums, percussion (2016–present)  Awards  Billy Talent has received a significant amount of recognition in Canada, winning 10 awards from 32 nominations at the MuchMusic Video Awards and 7 awards from 20 nominations at the Juno Awards. The band has also been nominated at the MuchMusic Video Awards every year since 2004. Overall, Billy Talent has received 21 awards from 56 nominations in Canada. The band also had the number 1 rock song of 2009 \\"Devil on My Shoulder\\" on Much Music's holiday wrap, along with the number five song \\"Fallen Leaves\\" for much music's 99 best music videos. They are also the most nominated band in Much Music Video Award history.

She is considered by some as the pioneer of modern anxiety treatment via Cognitive Therapy. She continues to be noted for her books on dealing with anxiety disorders. Many of today's anxiety self-help books continue to cite her work. Weekes found that many of her patients suffered from anxiety disorders, such as agoraphobia, panic attacks, phobias, generalised anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In her books, she frequently used the term \\"nervous breakdown\\", despite it being unscientific and unnecessarily alarming. She also avoided the term \\"Anxiety State\\", as she felt it was too \\"medical\\" for the purpose of her books. She decided to replace the terms with \\"Nervous Illness\\" instead. She was concerned by the severe long-term effect the disorders had on her patients' lives and by the failure of psychiatric treatments such as psychoanalysis, that many had tried. Instead, she developed a program of treatment based on ideas from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. She noted, for example that patients did not suffer from these problems because they had flawed personalities or traumatic childhoods. Rather, the problems were caused by the patient having a habit of fear-avoidance, made worse, or caused, by a very responsive \\"sensitized\\" nervous system. She was critical both of Freudian approaches and of attempts by behaviourists to \\"desensitise\\" their patients using relaxation. She described in her books the three main pitfalls that lead to Nervous Illness. They are sensitization, bewilderment and fear. She explained that so much nervous illness is no more than severe sensitization kept alive by bewilderment and fear. Dr. Weekes analyzed fear as two separate fears; the first fear and the second fear. She explained that first fear is the fear that comes reflexively, almost automatically. The patient usually immediately recoils from it, and as he/she does, he/she adds a second fear to the first. Second fear is the fear the patient adds to the first fear. Examples of second fear are \\"Oh, my goodness! Here it is again! I can't stand it!\\". It is the second fear that is keeping the first fear alive, keeping the sufferer sensitized, keeping them nervously ill. Her program was first given to her own patients and then, as word spread of its success, to others in the form of records and cassette tapes. Eventually, she developed a self-help pack consisting of a book and cassette, with Claire Weekes guiding patients through a program. She has summarized this program as follows; facing the feared situation, accepting the feeling of panic, floating through it, and letting time pass. Her first book, published in 1962 was called Self Help For Your Nerves (Hope and Help for Your Nerves in the US); this book has sold more than 300,000 copies, and has been translated into fourteen languages. Her second book, Peace from Nervous Suffering was published in 1972. Her third book, Simple Effective Treatment of Agoraphobia was published in 1976. Her fourth book More Help for Your Nerves was published in 1984. Her fifth and final book The Latest Help for Your Nerves was published in 1989, just one year before her death. In 1983 Dr. Weekes was interviewed in a series of six talks, called Peace From Nervous Suffering, on the British national TV programme Pebble Mill at One, which introduced people to her techniques. A transcription of these talks along with 2 BBC radio interviews and 2 interviews at White Plains Hospital, New York were published in her last book The Latest Help for Your Nerves. All five of her books offered self-help methods and advice. Her work was marked by the personal nature of her approach. Early in her career she had earned both a Doctorate of Science as well as an M.D. Claire Weekes described her own battle with nervous illness in her final book where she explained how she began suffering when she was 26 years old as she was misdiagnosed with TB for which she became introverted and worried. Her suffering lasted two years, and gave her valuable insight into nervous illness. Dr. Robert L. DuPont describes in his book \\"The Anxiety Cure\\" that in 1983, he asked her if she'd ever had panic disorder. She replied \\"Yes, I have had what you call panic attacks. In fact, I still have them. Sometimes they wake me at night.\\" Dr. DuPont responded by saying he was sorry to hear that. He described Claire Weekes as looking at him in shock, and she responded \\"Save your sympathy for someone else. I don't need it or want it. What you call a panic attack is merely a few normal chemicals that are temporarily out of place in my brain. It is of no significance whatsoever to me!\\" Although many general practitioners may be unaware of her books, they are still in print, and her work is promoted by an organization in Australia set up by her heirs. Over decades, Doctor Weekes' first three books have brought life- changing relief to hundreds of thousands of anxiety-stricken people around the world. Even though Doctor Weekes has been deceased for twenty five years, at least half of Amazon.com's customer reviews state that one of her books \\"saved my life\\". Her early work in reproduction and placentation in reptiles is held in high regard, and is commonly cited by researchers in the field. Early career in biology Claire Weekes began her career as a research scientist, receiving her D Sc in 1930 from the University of Sydney; she was the first woman to attain that degree from the university. Working under Prof. Launcelot Harrison, she conducted research on reproduction and placentation in viviparous (live-bearing) lizards from 1925–1934; part of this period (1929–1931) was spent in England in the lab of J.P. Hill. Weekes' work led to eight published papers, including a major summary published in 1935 in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. Weekes' work provided the basis an understanding of reptile placentation that lasted for nearly 50 years. More recent work has continued to build on the empirical and conceptual framework that she established. Weekes' research on the complex placentae of Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii was instrumental in the establishment of the species as a model organism for studying the evolution of pregnancy.

The Adventure of the Reigate Squires was first published in 1893. It is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. Doyle ranked \\"The Adventure of the Reigate Squire\\" twelfth in his list of his twelve favorite Holmes stories. Synopsis Watson takes Holmes to a friend's estate near Reigate in Surrey to rest after a rather strenuous case in France. Holmes finds that his services are needed here, but he also finds that his recent illness serves him well. His host is Colonel Hayter. There has recently been a burglary at the nearby Acton estate in which the thieves stole a motley assortment of things, even a ball of twine, but nothing terribly valuable. Then one morning, the Colonel's butler tells news of a murder at another nearby estate, the Cunninghams'. The victim is William Kirwan, the coachman. Inspector Forrester has taken charge of the investigation, and there is one physical clue: a torn piece of paper found in William's hand with a few words written on it. Holmes takes an instant interest in this, seeing something that Forrester has missed: it is quite clear to Holmes that the fragment of a note was written by two men, each writing alternate words. One man is young, and the other rather older. Moreover, they are related. Holmes, an expert at studying handwriting, does not voice this or any other observation or conclusion until the end of the story. He also observes that one line says \\"quarter to twelve\\", coincidentally the time of William's murder. One of the first facts to emerge is that there is a longstanding legal dispute between the Actons and the Cunninghams involving ownership of about half of the estate currently in the Cunninghams' hands. Holmes spends quite a bit of time investigating and interviewing the two Cunningham men, young Alec and his ageing father. Alec tells Holmes that he saw the burglar struggling with William when a shot went off and William fell dead. The burglar ran off through a hedge to the road. The elder Cunningham claims that he was in his room smoking at the time, and Alec says that he had also still been up. Holmes knows that they are lying. No burglar with any sense would break into a house when he could see by the lit lamps that someone was still afoot. Also, William's body has no powder burns on it; so he was not shot at point-blank range as the Cunninghams claim. The escape route also does not bear their story out: there is a boggy ditch next to the road that the fleeing murderer would have had to cross, yet there are no signs of any footprints in it. Holmes knows that it would be useful to get hold of the rest of that note found in William's hand. He believes that the murderer snatched it away from William and thrust it into his pocket, never realizing that a scrap of it was still in the murdered coachman's hand. Unfortunately, neither the police nor Holmes can get any information from William's mother, for she is quite old, deaf, and somewhat simple-minded. Holmes puts his recent illness to use and fakes a fit just as Forrester is about to mention the one clue to the Cunninghams. He suspects that the Cunninghams know where the rest of the note is, and does not wish them to destroy it. Holmes also cunningly gets the elder Cunningham to write the word \\"twelve\\", which appears on the scrap of paper recovered from the murder scene, by deliberately making a mistake in an advertisement that Holmes tells Cunningham to publish, and asking him to correct it. Holmes then insists on searching the Cunninghams' rooms despite their protests that the burglar, whom Holmes has by now dismissed as a fabrication, could not have gone there. He sees Alec's room and then his father's, where he deliberately knocks a small table over, sending some oranges and a water carafe to the floor. The others have not been looking his way at the time, and Holmes implies that the cause is Watson's clumsiness. Watson plays along and starts grovelling about to gather up scattered oranges. Everyone then notices that Holmes has left the room. Moments later, there are cries of \\"murder\\" and \\"help\\". Watson recognizes his friend's voice. He and Forrester rush to Alec's room where they find Alec trying to throttle Holmes and his father apparently twisting Holmes's wrist. The Cunninghams are quickly restrained, and Holmes tells Forrester to arrest the two for murdering William Kirwan. At first, Forrester thinks Holmes must be mad, but Holmes draws his attention to the looks on their faces – very guilty. After a revolver is knocked out of Alec's hand, the two are arrested. The gun, of course, is the one used to murder William, and it is seized. Holmes has found the rest of the note, still in Alec's dressing gown pocket. It runs thus (the words in boldface are the ones on the original scrap): :\\"If you will only come round at quarter to twelve : to the east gate you will learn what : will very much surprise you and maybe : be of the greatest service to you and also : to Annie Morrison. But say nothing to anyone : upon the matter.\\" The elder Cunningham's confidence is broken after his arrest and he tells all. It seems that William followed his two employers the night they broke into the Acton estate (Holmes has already deduced that it was they, in pursuit of documents supporting Mr. Acton's legal claim, which they did not find). William then proceeded to blackmail his employers – not realizing that it was dangerous to do such a thing to Alec – and they thought to use the recent burglary scare as a plausible way of getting rid of him. With a bit more attention paid to detail, they might very well have evaded all suspicion.  Holmes and Watson  This is one of the rare stories that show a glimpse of Watson's dedication and his life before he met Holmes, as well as Holmes' trust in Watson. Colonel Hayter is a former patient Watson treated in Afghanistan and has offered his house to Watson and Holmes. Watson admits in convincing Holmes, \\"A little diplomacy was needed,\\" for Holmes resists anything that sounds like coddling or sentimentalism. Watson also glosses over the facts of Holmes' illness from overwork, implying redundancy because all of Europe was \\"ringing with his name.\\" Holmes' health has collapsed after straining himself to the limit, and his success in the case means nothing to him in the face of his depression. With his superhuman physical and mental achievement, he has a correspondingly drastic fit of nervous prostration and needs Watson's assistance. Holmes clearly has no problem with asking Watson for help when he needs it, for he sends a wire and Watson is at his side twenty-four hours later. At the onset of the mystery, Watson warns Holmes to rest, not to get started on a new problem. However, Watson knows and has revealed in other writings that inactivity is anathema to Holmes, and his caution comes off as weak. Holmes takes it all with humour, but the reader does not doubt his mind is eagerly upon the trail of the crime. At the conclusion, he tells Watson: \\"I think our quiet rest in the country has been a distinct success, and I shall certainly return much invigorated, to Baker Street to-morrow.\\"Direct Quote from The Reigate Squires Publication history The story only bore the title \\"The Reigate Squire\\" for its first appearance in The Strand Magazine.

Brought by the Normans—as Amable—to the British Isles, the name was there common as both Amabel and the abbreviated Mabel throughout the Middle Ages, with Mabel subsequently remaining common until circa 1700, from which point its usage was largely restricted to Ireland, Mabel there being perceived as a variant of the Celtic name Maeve, until the name had a Victorian revival in Britain, facilitated by the 1853 publication of the novel The Heir of Redclyffe by Charlotte M. Yonge, which features an Irish character named Mabel Kilcoran; Yonge's novel also features a character named Amabel, but her novel only significantly boosted the popularity of the name in the form Mabel, which became immensely popular in both the British Isles and the United States. At the start of the 20th century, Mabel's popularity began a slow decline which accelerated from the 1930s; the name has seen very light usage since the 1960s. Due to its origin as an abridgement of Amabel it has been surmised that Mabel was originally pronounced with a short A, the name's pronunciation with a long A dating only from its mid-19th-century revival.

(Actual publication dates were in the preceding month, as usual for UK magazines.) It won the InDin Magazine of the Year award in both 1990 and 1991, and was also briefly the best-selling multi-format 16-bit computer magazine in the UK. History The pre-launch editor and Publisher was Teresa Maughan (also Publisher of Your Sinclair) and editor was Gareth Herincx, who vacated the hotseat during the construction of issue 3 at which point Tim Ponting took over. Reviewers for the launch issue were: Jonathan Davies, Sean Kelly, Duncan MacDonald, David McCandless, Marcus 'Binky' Berkmann, and Matt Bielby (all former writers for Your Sinclair). Other journalists of note who passed through Zero's hallowed chambers included David 'Whistlin' Rick' Wilson, 'Lord' Paul Lakin, Amaya Lopez, Jackie Sutton, Rich Pelley and Jane Goldman. Issue 1 contained a coverdisk containing two free games for the Amiga and Atari ST. A regular coverdisk was later introduced which included full games and playable demos. Zero caused controversy when issue 31 included a playable demo of Cover Girl Poker on the cover disk. This resulted in the magazine being banned from the leading newsagents. By issue 33 the magazine was re-designed without the spine and had taken on a more youth orientated look. Content Game demos on a cover disk included with Zero in the May 1991 issue. Like many similar magazines, it contained sections of news, game reviews, previews, tips, help guides, columnists, reader's letters, and cover-mounted disks of game demos.

Doyle ranked \\"The Adventure of the Crooked Man\\" 15th in a list of his 19 favourite Sherlock Holmes stories.Trivia on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Favorite Sherlock Holmes Stories  Trivia Library Synopsis Holmes calls on Watson late one evening to tell him about a case that he has been working on, and also to invite him to be a witness to the final stage of the investigation. Colonel James Barclay, of The Royal Mallows based at Aldershot Camp, is dead, apparently by violence, and his wife, Nancy, is the prime suspect. The Colonel's brother officers are quite perplexed at the Colonel's fate, as most of them have always believed that he and Nancy were a happy couple. They have observed over the years, however, that the Colonel seemed more attached to his wife than she to him. They have also noticed that the Colonel sometimes had bouts of deep depression and moodiness for no apparent reason. As a married officer, the Colonel lived with his wife in a villa outside the camp at Aldershot, and one evening Nancy went out in the evening with her next-door neighbor, Miss Morrison, on an errand connected with her church, and came back not long afterwards. She went into the seldom-used morning room and asked the maid to fetch her some tea, which was unusual for Nancy. Hearing that his wife had returned, the Colonel joined her in the morning room. The coachman saw him enter, and that was the last time that he was seen alive. The morning room's blinds were up, and the glass door leading out onto the lawn was open. When the maid brought the tea, she heard an argument in progress between Nancy and her husband, and she heard Nancy say the name \\"David\\". She fetched the other maid and the coachman, who came and listened. Nancy was very angry and shouting about what a coward her husband was; his words were softer and less distinct. Suddenly, the Colonel cried out, there was a crash, and Nancy screamed. Holmes, Watson and the \\"Crooked Man\\". Realizing that something awful had just happened, the coachman tried to force the locked door, but could not. He remembered the outside glass door, and went outside to get into the room through that. Upon entering, he found that Nancy had fainted, and the Colonel was lying dead in a pool of his own blood. The coachman summoned the police and medical help, and also found, to his surprise, that the key was not in the locked door on the inside. Later, a thorough search failed to turn it up. A peculiar club-like weapon was also found in the morning room. Although the staff has seen the Colonel's weapon collection, they do not recognize this weapon. Holmes believes that the case is not what it initially appears to be. Although the staff are quite sure that they only heard the Colonel's and his wife's voices, Holmes is convinced that a third person came into the room at the time of the Colonel's death and, rather oddly, made off with the key. This Holmes deduces from footmarks found in the road, on the lawn, and in the morning room. Odder still, the mystery man seems to have brought an animal with him. Judging from the footmarks it made, it is long with short stumpy legs, like a weasel or a stoat, but bigger than either of those animals. It left claw marks on the curtain, too, leading Holmes to deduce that it was a carnivore, for there was a bird cage near the curtain. Holmes is sure that Miss Morrison holds the key to the mystery, and he is right. She claims to know nothing of the reason for the argument between her neighbors, but when Holmes tells her that Nancy could easily face a murder charge, she feels that she can betray her promise to her and tells all. On their short outing, the two women met a bent, deformed old man carrying a wooden box. He looked up at Nancy and recognized her, and she him. Nancy asked Miss Morrison to walk on ahead as there was apparently a private matter to discuss with this man. She came back very angry, and made her friend swear not to say anything about the incident, claiming the man was a former acquaintance who had fallen on hard times. This breaks the case wide open for Holmes. He knows that there cannot be many men of this description in the area, and soon identifies him as Henry Wood, and goes with Watson to visit him the next day in his room. Wood explains all. He had been a corporal in the same regiment as Colonel Barclay, who was still a sergeant at that time, at the time of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, then known as the 'Mutiny'. Also at this time, he and Barclay were both vying for Nancy's hand. Henry was not deformed, and much better looking in those days. The regiment was confined to its cantonment by the turmoil in India, and water had run out, among other problems. A volunteer was asked for, to go out and summon help, and Henry volunteered to do so. Sergeant James Barclay—later the Colonel—instructed Henry on the safest route to take. But as Henry traveled along the route, he was attacked and taken prisoner, being knocked unconscious in the process. When he came to, he gathered from what he knew of the local language, spoken by his captors, that Sergeant Barclay had betrayed him to the enemy, driven by one motive—to get rid of Henry so he could have Nancy for himself. Henry was tortured repeatedly, which is how he became deformed, spent years as a slave or wandering, made money as a conjurer, and when he was getting old, he longed to come back to England. He sought out soldiers because he was familiar with the milieu. Then, quite by chance, he met Nancy that evening, who was shocked to learn he was alive. Unknown to her, however, he followed her home and witnessed the argument, for the blinds were up and the glass door open. He climbed over the low wall and entered the room. An apoplectic fit caused by the sight of him killed the Colonel instantly, and Nancy fainted. Henry's first thought then was to open the inside door and summon help, and he took the key from the now-unconscious Nancy to do so. Realizing that the situation looked very bad for him and that he himself could be charged with murder, he chose instead to flee, stopping long enough to retrieve Teddy, his mongoose that he used in his conjuring acts, which had escaped from the wooden box. However, he did drop his stick, the strange weapon that was later found, and he inadvertently carried the key off with him. An inquest has already exonerated Nancy, having found the cause of the Colonel's death—apoplexy (Wood claimed the Colonel was dead before he received his apparently lethal head wound from hitting the fireplace fender, and the experts had apparently come to the same conclusion). As for \\"David\\", this was apparently a reproach in which Nancy likened her husband to the biblical king, who had Bathsheba's husband Uriah transferred to a zone with heavy fighting so that he would be killed, leaving David free to marry Uriah's wife. Commentary \\"Elementary, my dear Watson\\" is an often quoted line from Sherlock Holmes. However, Holmes never says this in any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories. In The Adventure of the Crooked Man, though, he comes his closest to it: :\\"I have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear Watson,\\" said he. :… :\\"Excellent!\\" I cried. :\\"Elementary,\\" said he. The Granada Television version reverses the oft-quoted \\"Elementary, my dear Watson\\" by ending with Watson deducing that Holmes had looked up a passage in the Bible since they returned home from Aldershot. When Holmes asks Watson how he knew he replies \\"Elementary, my dear Holmes\\" after explaining how he reached his conclusion. The exact date of this story's setting is unknown, but since Nancy has been married for \\"upward of thirty years\\" and the Indian Rebellion broke out in 1857, the date would seem to be sometime after 1887. The first few lines by Watson tell that this story occurred in the \\"summer\\" just after his marriage which was in 1889; thus summer of 1889 would be about right. Publication history \\"The Adventure of the Crooked Man\\" was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in July 1893, and in the US in Harper's Weekly on 8 July 1893. It was also published in the US edition of The Strand Magazine in August 1893.Smith (2014), p. 88. The story was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand.Cawthorne (2011), p. 86. It was included in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.Cawthorne (2011), p. 75. Adaptations=Film and television The story was adapted as a 1923 silent short film as part of the Stoll film series. It starred Eille Norwood as Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson, and featured Gladys Jennings as Mrs Barclay and Dora De Winton as Miss Morrison. The Granada TV version with Jeremy Brett is faithful to the original -- except that it has the housekeeper, instead of the coachman, tell Holmes of the clue of the missing key. It also hints that the \\"Mallows\\" are a \\"Lancers\\" regiment and that Barclay owed most of his rapid rise in ranks from Sergeant to Officer due at least in part to his marriage to the daughter of the regimental sergeant major -- rather than merit, as Murphy was already a young sub-officer at the time Barclay was a Sgt; at the time of the story Murphy is still only a major in \\"temporary\\" command of the regiment. It starred Norman Jones as Henry Wood, Lisa Daniely as Nancy Barclay, Denys Hawthorne as James Barclay, Fiona Shaw as Miss Morrison, Paul Chapman as Major Murphy, Shelagh Stephenson as Jane, Michael Lumsden as young Henry Wood, Catherine Rabett as young Nancy, and James Wilby as young Barclay. The story was adapted as a 1999 episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century titled \\"The Crooked Man\\". Holmes describes this case to his addiction group in the episode \\"A Giant Gun, Filled with Drugs\\" (2013) in the CBS TV series Elementary. Radio Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes which aired on 1 December 1930, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 26. Edith Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the later American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that was broadcast on 10 November 1940.Dickerson (2019), p. 96. Michael Hardwick dramatised the story as a 1966 BBC Light Programme radio adaptation, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. \\"The Crooked Man\\" was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1992 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Brian Blessed as Henry Wood and Terence Edmond as Major Murphy. This adaptation contains a twist to the end of the denouement scene: after Holmes has left the room, Watson advises Wood to wait a while and then return to Nancy Barclay, that his disfigurement will not matter to her. Wood answers ambiguously, and the matter is left (as far as the audience is concerned) unresolved. The story was adapted as an episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. The episode aired in 2015.

Doyle ranked \\"The Adventure of the Resident Patient\\" eighteenth in a list of his nineteen favourite Sherlock Holmes stories.Trivia on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Favorite Sherlock Holmes Stories  Trivia Library Synopsis Doctor Percy Trevelyan brings Holmes an unusual problem. Having been a brilliant student but a poor man, Dr. Trevelyan has found himself a participant in an unusual business arrangement. A man named Blessington, claiming to have some money to invest, has set Trevelyan up in premises with a prestigious address and paid all his expenses. In return, he demands three-fourths of all the money that the doctor's practice earns, which he collects every evening, going over the books thoroughly and leaving the doctor 5/3d of every guinea (21 shillings or £1 1/- in pre-decimalized currency) from the day's takings. Blessington is himself infirm, it turns out, and likes this arrangement because he can always have a doctor nearby. Everything has gone fairly well for the doctor since the arrangement began. Now, however, something has happened to Blessington. He has become excitable and agitated, this after he said that he had read about a burglary somewhere in the city. Shortly thereafter, the doctor acquired a new patient, a Russian nobleman with cataleptic fits. His grown son brought him in the evening while Blessington was taking his usual walk. The son insisted on waiting out in the waiting room while the doctor saw his father. During the consultation, the patient had a fit, sitting bolt upright and going quite rigid. The doctor rushed for some nitrite of amyl for his patient to inhale, but upon returning, found that both his patient and his son had left. Surprisingly, the same two men came back the next evening, the son claiming that he had seen his father walk out into the waiting room and assumed the consultation was over. He then had taken his father home, only later realizing that something was not quite right. The doctor had another consultation with the Russian gentleman, and after they had left, Blessington was utterly beside himself. Someone had been in his room. There were footprints to prove it. It could only have been the Russian nobleman's son, but why did he go in there? Nothing had been disturbed or stolen. At this point in Trevelyan's story, Holmes thinks that it would be wise to go to the doctor's Brook Street practice right away to see for himself what this odd case is all about. He discovers firsthand just how paranoid Blessington has become: he greets Holmes, Watson, and Trevelyan with a gun, but the doctor convinces him that the visitors mean no harm. Holmes asks Blessington who these men are, and why they want to molest him. Blessington nervously says that he cannot answer the first question, but by way of answering the second question, he says that he keeps all his money in a box in his bedroom, as he does not trust bankers. Holmes knows that it must be more than this. He leaves in disgust, advising Blessington that he can expect no advice if he tries to deceive him. Shortly after leaving, Holmes outlines to Watson his train of thought. He knows that two men, perhaps more, are out to get Blessington. The catalepsy was faked, just to keep Doctor Trevelyan busy so that he would not notice the other man going into Blessington's room. They did not wish to steal anything, as can be seen in their failure to rummage around in the room. They chose an appointment in the evening knowing that there would be no other patients in the waiting room. Holmes also knows just looking at Blessington that he is afraid for his own life, and deduces that he must therefore know who is after him, for no man could have such enemies without knowing about it. Also, it was only by chance that Blessington was not in both times that these two men came; they were obviously not familiar with Blessington's personal habits. The next morning brings news that Blessington has hanged himself. Trevelyan's brougham is sent to 221B Baker Street to bring Holmes to the scene. When Holmes and Watson arrive, Blessington's body is still hanging from a hook in his bedroom ceiling. Inspector Lanner is there. He believes that it is a suicide, but Holmes soon deduces otherwise. Discarded cigar butts and other clues tell him that three other men were there, and for a while. They were let into the premises by a confederate inside, as the door was still barred in the morning. Suspicion falls on the new page, who has vanished. It seems obvious to Holmes that the men came to \\"try\\" Blessington, and reached a verdict of guilty, and a sentence of death, which they then proceeded to carry out. A little digging at police headquarters brings up the rest of the truth. All four of the men were once members of a criminal gang that robbed banks. Blessington's real name was Sutton, and the other three, two of whom played the Russians, were Biddle, Hayward, and Moffat. After robbing the Worthington Bank of £7,000 in 1875, Blessington (or Sutton) had turned informer, and as a result, another gang member, Cartwright, had been hanged for murdering the caretaker, and the other three had each been given 15 years in prison. Blessington's \\"paranoia\\" was indeed a very real fear, caused by news of their early release, not by some burglary, as he claimed. The murderers chose hanging as their form of execution to avenge Cartwright. Eventually, the page turns up, but the case against him falls apart for lack of evidence. As for the other three, they are never heard from again, and it is believed that they perished in the wreck of the Norah Creina off Portugal. Publication history \\"The Adventure of the Resident Patient\\" was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in August 1893, and in the US in Harper's Weekly on 12 August 1893. It was also published in the US edition of The Strand Magazine in September 1893.Smith (2014), p. 97. The story was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand.Cawthorne (2011), p. 86. It was included in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.Cawthorne (2011), p. 75. In many editions, the story starts with the Holmes \\"mind- reading\\" scene from \\"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\\", which was added to this story after Doyle decided the latter story should not be included in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. Adaptations=Film and television The story was adapted as a 1921 silent short film as part of the Stoll film series. It starred Eille Norwood as Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson, and featured Judd Green as Blessington. In the 1985 Granada television adaptation starring Jeremy Brett, the episode presents Watson attempting to apply Holmes' methods to uncover his friend's current state but largely failing, although Holmes does admit that \\"there is an element of truth in what you say\\". This scene is very much in the manner of the Doyle-penned parody \\"How Watson Learned the Trick\\", which also features Watson making incorrect conclusions about Holmes. Near the end of the episode, Watson initially intends to entitle his memoir of the case \\"The Brook Street Mystery\\", but Holmes recommends the title \\"The Resident Patient\\". During the credits, Watson wrestles with variations of the suggestion before settling on \\"The Resident Patient\\". The ninth episode of Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century, a sci-fi reimagining of some of Doyle's stories in which Holmes is brought back to life to combat a clone of Moriarty, is based on this story with significant changes. Blessington is a plastic surgeon who was coerced by Moriarty's henchman Martin Fenwick and some goons into using his experimental technology of molding one's face to another, as well as masking the subject's DNA for a short time before the effects wear off. Blessington survives this version. Radio Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes which aired on 12 January 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 27.

The structures have been dated to the 19th century AD and they may originally have been a byproduct of contemporary agricultural techniques. Other pyramids employing the same methods and materials of construction can be found in various sites on Tenerife. In Güímar itself there were nine pyramids, only six of which survive.

There Heyerdahl researched possible parallels between the Canarian terrace structures and pyramid structures in Egypt and Central America in pre- Columbian Mesoamerica as ceremonial areas. Heyerdahl hypothesised that the Canarian pyramids formed a temporal and geographic stopping point on voyages between ancient Egypt and the Maya civilization, initiating a controversy in which historians, esoterics, archaeologists, astronomers, and those with a general interest in history took part.Juan Francisco Navarro Mederos: Arqueología de las Islas Canarias\\", in: Espacio, Tiempo y Forma, Serie I, Prehistoria y Arqueología, Bd. 10, 1997, S. 467.Antonio Aparicio Juan/César Esteban López, Las Pirámides de Güímar: mito y realidad.

The main limiting wall points to the sunset in the Summer solstice and the pyramids have stairs on their western side which face the direction of the rising sun on the Winter solstice. Also, standing on the platform of the largest pyramid on the day of the Summer solstice it is possible to experience a double sunset, as first the sun sets behind a mountain top, then it emerges again from behind the mountain and sets a second time behind a neighbouring peak.J.

Aparicio and Esteban suggest that the solstitial orientations of the pyramids were potentially motivated by the Masonic symbolism. These authors argue that solstices are very important in the symbolism of Freemasonry, and that the owner of the land in the epoch in which the pyramids were built was himself a Freemason. This motivation would be only an aesthetic one and would not modify in any rate the fundamental motivation (agriculture) and date of construction.  Archaeological excavations  Between 1991 and 1998, with the agreement of Thor Heyerdahl, multiple excavations of the site by archaeologists of the University of La Laguna (Departamento de Prehistoria, Antropología e Historia Antigua) took place. In 1996 the results of the 1991 excavation were presented at a colloquium (published in 1998), providing evidence for the dating of the pyramids.Maria Cruz Jiménez Gómez/Juan Francisco Navarro Mederos, El complejo de las morras de Chacona (Güímar, Tenerife): resultados del proyecto de investigación, XII Coloquio de Historia Canario-Americana (1996), Cabildo Insular de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria 1998, vol. 1. According to the preceding geophysical Georadar-Survey eight locations adjacent to the pyramids, each with an area of 25 m², were investigated in layers down to the solid lava-floor. In doing so it was possible to establish three specific sediment layers. Starting from the top these were: # A layer of thickness averaging 20 cm, consisting of humus-rich earth with many plant remains and roots; tracks from ploughing were clearly identifiable as were a broad spectrum of readily datable finds from the second half of the 20th century. # A layer of thickness averaging 25 cm, similar in composition to the first layer, however containing less humus and a larger amount of small stones; a large variety of finds which could be dated to the 19th and 20th century were found, of which an official seal from 1848 deserves particular mention. # A layer of thickness between 25 and 150 cm, composed out of small volcanic rocks, most likely put in place in one movement, which levelled the uneven stone underneath; the stones contained only very few finds, mostly a small number of pottery shards, of which some was local and some imported, both kinds were roughly estimated as belonging to the 19th century; the pyramids stand strategraphically directly on top of this bottom layer, therefore allowing only for an earliest date of construction of the pyramids within the 19th century.Juan Francisco Navarro Mederos/Maria Cruz Jiménez Gómez: El difusionismo atlántico y las pirámides de Chacona, in: Miguel Ángel Molinero Polo y Domingo Sola Antequera: Arte y Sociedad del Egipto antiguo. Madrid 2000, S. 246-249. Furthermore, under the border edge of one of the pyramids, a natural lava cave was discovered. It had been walled up and yielded artefacts from the time of the Guanches. Since the pyramids lie stratigraphically above the cave, the Guanche finds from between 600 and 1000 AD can only support conclusions on the date of human use of the cave. The above survey indicates that the pyramids themselves cannot be older than the 19th century.Part of the preceding sections are based on the German wikipedia article Pyramiden von Güímar. Conclusions Pyramids of Güímar The archaeologists involved maintain that the creation of the terrace structures followed from the practices of the 19th century rural population, who created these structures while clearing cultivatable land of stones, as they piled the stones into these terrace shapes. The excavations and subsequent research support a date for the construction of the structures no earlier than the 19th century. Heyerdahl suggested that the structures were not haphazardly piled-up stones. Heyerdahl maintained a belief in the hypothesis that the pyramids were connected with Guanches until his death. The association of the Guanches and the pyramids continues to be elaborated upon both in \\"Pyramid park\\" and on its official website. Aparicio and Esteban's theory connects the facts that the pyramids were built in the 19th century with the acknowledgement that they are not simply piles of stones.  Ethnographic park  Following the completion of the excavations in 1998, the 65,000 m² area surrounding the pyramids was made accessible to the public. Heyerdahl received financial support from his friend the Canarian businessman Fred Olsen, who owns the largest transport company in the Canaries and whose family came to the islands from Norway in the 20th century. An information centre provides visitors with information about Heyerdahl’s research trips and his previous ideas regarding the pyramids. Two pavilions contain exhibits relating to Heyerdahl along with models of his boats; a replica of the Ra II in its original size, amongst others. In spite of the conclusions regarding the age of the pyramids outlined above, Heyerdahl continued to maintain a belief \\"in a possible relationship between the existence of the pyramids and the pre Hispanic civilisation on Tenerife\\".Flyer from the \\"pyramid park\\" in Güímar, received on the 16.02.2008 at the ticket booth: Pirámides de Güímar.

The act created the National Register of Historic Places, the list of National Historic Landmarks, and the State Historic Preservation Offices. Senate Bill 3035, the National Historic Preservation Act, was signed into law on October 15, 1966, and is the most far-reaching preservation legislation ever enacted in the United States. Several amendments have been made since. Among other things, the act requires federal agencies to evaluate the impact of all federally funded or permitted projects on historic properties (buildings, archaeological sites, etc.) through a process known as Section 106 Review. Many of the historic preservation provisions that had been in 16 U.S.C. are in 54 U.S.C. § 300101 through § 320303 by Public Law 113–287 of December 19, 2014. Early development Prior to the 1960s, \\"historic preservation was,\\" according to a 2015 column in The Washington Post, \\"neither a public policy issue nor part of America's architectural, planning and real estate development culture. Historic-preservation laws didn't exist.\\" Although there was no national policy regarding preservation until 1966, efforts in the 19th century initiated the journey towards legislation. One of the earliest efforts of the preservation movement occurred around the 1850s. President George Washington's home, Mount Vernon, was in shambles. His nephew attempted to sell it to the federal government for $200,000, but the government did not authorize such a purchase.Christopher J. Duerken et all., A Handbook on Historic Preservation Law, edited by Christopher J. Duerken (Washington D.C.: Conservation Foundation: National Center for Preservation Law, 1983), 1. To prevent further destruction or conversion of the property to a resort, Ann Pamela Cunningham founded the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association to fight for this house. After establishing the first group promoting preservation efforts, they raised the money to acquire the property and protect it from ruin. Due to their efforts, this house has come to stand to represent the nation and the birth of independence, but it also, \\"served as a blueprint for later organizations.\\"Christopher Tunnard, \\"Landmarks of Beauty,\\" With Heritage So Rich, chaired by Albert Rains, directed by Laurence G. Henderson (New York: Random House, 1966), 30. & Mitchell Schwarzer, \\"Myths of Permanence and Transience in the Discourse on Historic Preservation in the United States,\\" Journal of Architectural Education 48, no. 1 (September 1994): 3–4. In 1906, an act was passed on the behalf of the nation's history and land. President Teddy Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act that \\"prohibited the excavation of antiquities from public lands without a permit from the Secretary of Interior.\\"Thomas F. King, Cultural Resource: Law and Practice, 2nd ed. (New York: Altamira Press, 2004), 19. It also gave the president authority to declare a specific piece of land a national monument, therefore protecting it from scavengers and proclaiming national identity.Duerken, 8. In 1916, the Department of the Interior established a new entity known as the National Park Service, the nation's first agency to regulate and manage public space, including the national monuments.King, 19. \\"Over the past fifty years the NPS has acquired more than of land, including not only the great chain of parks preserved for their natural beauty and value, but an extraordinary variety of historic buildings, monuments, and sites.\\"Walter Muri Whitehall, \\"The Right of Cities to be Beautiful,\\" With Heritage So Rich, chaired by Albert Rains, directed by Laurence G. Henderson (New York: Random House, 1966), 48. By 1935, Congress passed the Historic Sites Act, which established a national policy for preservation and permitted the Secretary of Interior to create programs on behalf of preservation efforts.Adina W. Kanefield, Federal Historic Preservation Case Law, 1966-1996, rev. ed., http://www.achp.gov/book/TOC2.html (accessed April 19, 2008). During the Great Depression era, the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) was established by the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration. It provided jobs for unemployed architects, engineers, and surveyors . They were charged with surveying, recording, documenting, and interpreting historic properties, creating an invaluable documentation of numerous buildings and other structures.King, 20. The Historic Sites Act also organized the national parks under the National Park Service, which created the foundation for the future development of the National Register of Historic Places.Duekern, 8. Although the Antiquities Act and Historic Sites Act were major stepping stones for the preservation movement, these did not create a broad public \\"national awareness.\\"Kanefield. On October 26, 1949, President Harry Truman signed legislation creating the National Trust for Historic Preservation \\"to facilitate public participation in the preservation of sites, buildings, and objects of national significance or international interest.\\" In addition, the law \\"enforced public participation in preserving and protecting the sites, buildings, objects of national significance in American history.\\"Whitehall, 49. Initially, the National Trust for Historic Preservation did not provide funds for preservation projects. Today, they offer funds for planning and education and provide a plethora of information, techniques, and methods to assist people in carrying out preservation efforts locally. Post WWII and urban renewal In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 into law which established the Interstate Highway System, providing an easy and efficient way for troops to depart if under attack. Due to this new construction, many historic properties were destroyed. In the 1960s, President John F. Kennedy launched the Urban Renewal Program. Hoping the plan would rejuvenate the cities, it in fact increased the destruction in the downtown areas.King, 21. The increase in population around this time, as well, and the manufacturing of cars called for a rapid change, therefore hindering our nation and its culture.Tunnard, 30. \\"With the urbanization, tear downs, and rebuilding America ... it is destroying the physical evidence of the past.\\" During the 1950s and 1960s, people saw the negative changes in their cities and developed a concern for their \\"quality of life that reflected their identity.\\"King, 22. As a response to the nationwide destruction brought about by federally initiated programs, a report coordinated by Lady Bird Johnson analyzed the country and the effects of urban renewal. With Heritage So Rich, an accumulation of essays, wrote \\"an expansive inventory of properties reflecting the nation's heritage, a mechanism to protect those properties from unnecessary harm caused by federal activities, a program of financial incentives, and an independent federal preservation body to coordinate the actions of federal agencies affecting historic preservation.\\"Robert Stipe, A Richer Heritage: Historic Preservation in 21st Century (Chapel Hill: University of Chapel Hill Press, 2003), 35. The book triggered public awareness of the issue and offered a proposition to handle the situation through the National Historic Preservation Act. National Historic Preservation Act The National Historic Preservation Act was signed into law by Lyndon B. Johnson on October 15, 1966.Stipe, 35. This act established several institutions: Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, State Historic Preservation Office, National Register of Historic Places, and the Section 106 review process. The Section 106 Process is further explained and defined in 36 CFR Part 800. Meeting four times a year, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation consists of 23 members from both public and private sectors, with the chairman appointed by the president.Stipe, 38. The Council's role is to advise the President and Congress on historic preservation issues, to develop policies and guidelines handling any conflicts of federal agencies, and to participate in the Section 106 review process.Duerken, 9. & Kanefield. The National Register of Historic Places, overseen by the National Park Service, is the nation's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects worthy of preservation,King, 40. and are officially designated \\"historic properties\\" regardless of whether they are archaeological or historic. To be eligible for listing, a property must meet one of four criteria and have sufficient integrity.A property does not have to be officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places to receive protection, they just have to be considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. One historian notes that National Park Service administrators \\"...responded enthusiastically to their growing professional authority by issuing a new, systematic outline of American history to serve as a guideline for the agency.\\" John A. Matzko, Reconstructing Fort Union (University of Nebraska Press, 2001), p. 65. Being listed on or eligible for listing on the National Register does not automatically prevent damage or destruction but it qualifies these approved properties for grants, loans, and tax incentives.Charles E. Fisher, \\"Promoting the Preservation of Historic Buildings: Historic Preservation Policy in the United States,\\" APT Bulletin 29, no. ¾ (1998): 8. The State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and Officer was established by the NHPA to coordinate statewide inventory of historic properties, nominate properties to the National Register, maintain a statewide preservation plan, assist others, and advise and educate locals.King, 42. There are a total of 59 SHPO officers, one for each state with eight additional ones, which include the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and others. Section 106 review process Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act mandates federal agencies undergo a review process for all federally funded and permitted projects that will impact sites listed on, or eligible for listing on, the National Register of Historic Places. Specifically it requires the federal agency to \\"take into account\\" the effect a project may have on historic properties. It allows interested parties an opportunity to comment on the potential impact projects may have on significant archaeological or historic sites. The main purpose for the establishment of the Section 106 review process is to minimize potential harm and damage to historic properties.Stipe, 49. Any federal agency whose project, funding or permit may affect a historic property, both those listed or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, must consider the effects on historic properties and \\"seek ways to avoid, minimize or mitigate\\" any adverse effects on historic properties. The typical Section 106 Review involves four primary steps: 1 - Initiation of the Section 106 Review; 2 - Identification of Historic Properties; 3 - Assessment of Adverse Effects; and 4 - Resolution of Adverse Effects. Further steps may be required if there is a disagreement among the consulting parties on adverse effects or the resolution of the effects.Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, \\"Protection Historic Properties: A Citizen's Guide to Section 106 Review,\\" Updated Brochure 2011. The federal agency overseeing the project inventories the project area (or contracts with a qualified consultant) to determine the presence or absence of historic properties. They then submit to the SHPO a Determination of Effect/Finding of Effect (DOE/FOE) outlining to the SHPO the project, the efforts taken identify historic properties, and what effects, if any, the project may have on historic properties. If the project is believed to have no adverse effect on eligible historic resources and the SHPO and other consulting parties agree, then the Section 106 process is effectively closed and the project may proceed. Alternatively, if an adverse effect is expected, the agency is required to work with the local State Historic Preservation Office to ensure that all interested parties are given an opportunity to review the proposed work and provide comments. This step seeks ways for the project to avoid having an adverse effect on historic properties. Ideally, a Memorandum of Agreement is reached between all consulting parties outlining agreed to mitigation or avoidance of historic properties, but this is not always the case. Without this process historical properties would lose a significant protection. This process helps decide different approaches and solutions to the project, but does not prevent any site from demolition or alteration. Motives Early preservation efforts were driven by patriotism and a desire to protect the new establishment of the nation by wealthy, private individuals. Early efforts focused primarily on individual structures as opposed to areas such as a neighborhood in a city or a rural landscape. The preserved structures were often turned into museums to create a showcase and generate tourism.Fisher, 7. The focus of preservation eventually shifted from patriotism to the aesthetics of a structure or area and ultimately to their structural relationships with society at large.Schwarzer, 2. According to Robin Elizabeth Datel, modern motivations for preservation can be summed up in four points: * to retain diverse elements of past * to perpetuate the distinctive identities of places * to involve amateurs in landscape care * to practice a conservation approach to environmental change.Robin Elizabeth Datel, \\"Preservation and a Sense of Orientation for American Cities,\\" Geographical Review 75, no. 2 (April 1985): 125. The economic benefits of preservation continue to become more important and better understood and documented. Preservation efforts produce the most number of jobs in the nation's economyDonovan D. Rypkema, The Economics of Historic Preservation: A Community Leader's Guide (Washington D.C.: National Trust for Historic Preservation, 1994), 11. and these jobs create new businesses and tourism, increase property values, and enhanced the quality of life in a community. Gotcha. Effects The National Historic Preservation Act has led to major changes in the employment trends in historic preservation fields. Archaeologists, historians, historic architects, and others have been employed in vast numbers in the field of cultural resource management. Cultural resource management is an umbrella term which encompasses archaeology, historic preservation and other disciplines when employed for the purposes of compliance with NHPA and other federal and state-mandated historic preservation laws. Prior to the passage and subsequent enforcement (through litigation) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and other laws, most archaeologists, historians, and other historic preservation specialists were employed primarily in the field of academia, working at universities or other places of higher learning. However, since the passage of the NHPA, ever- increasing numbers of these professionals are employed in support of the cultural resources management industry. Large public works projects often require that teams of archaeologists perform limited excavations in order to properly inventory buried archaeological remains and assess their eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places. This industry has also allowed a larger swath of individuals to participate in archaeology and history as, unlike in the academic arena, a PhD is not required to earn a professional livelihood. The Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualification Standards for archeologists require a graduate degree plus at least one year of full-time experience, at least four months of fieldwork, and demonstrated ability to carry research to completion. Additionally, the basic field work often required in support of performing inventories of cultural resources is conducted by individuals with or earning bachelor's degrees. As a result, many undergraduates and recent graduates in the fields which support the implementation of the National Historic Preservation Act have found gainful employment. In the past, they stood little chance of earning a living in these fields without an advanced degree. However, Cultural Resource Management (CRM) is still one of the lowest paying fields for educated professionals.

He was best-known for his work revolved around his Urdu poetry. Syed Zamir Jafri was born in a Syed family. He was the father of former Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Chief Syed Ehtesham Zamir. His native village, Chak Abdul Khaliq, is located near Dina, in the Jhelum district. Jafri has had great influence on Urdu poetry, and has focused on themes of peace and love for mankind. He had published 78 books of poetry and prose, written in Urdu, Punjabi, and English. In addition, he translated Malay folklore (Pantuns), poems by Nazar-ul-Islam, and translations from the monumental Punjabi classic the “Saif-Ul-Malook” by Mian Muhammad Bakhsh. As a Co-Editor, he is responsible for the production of the “Urdu Punch”, which is considered to be the most sophisticated and esteemed journal of Urdu Humor. After graduating from Islamia College, Jafri started as a journalist in Lahore but joined the Indian Army War Propaganda Directorate at the start of the Second World War. He was stationed at the headquarters in Delhi, alongside writers and intellectuals like M.D.Taseer, Majid Malik, and Faiz Ahmed Faiz. Jafri was posted to the Far East where he continued to serve in the Education Corps of Pakistan Army and participated in the Indo-Pakistani wars of 1947–1948 and 1965. He retired from the Army as a Major in 1965 and was appointed the first Director Public Relations of Capital Development Authority - a body formed to look after the development of Pakistan’s newly announced capital at Islamabad. Jafri remained at this post for over fifteen years and had the honor of naming the roads and residential/commercial sectors of the new Capital. Thereafter, he served on contract assignments as Deputy Director- General of Pakistan National Centre in the Ministry of Information, as Advisor to the Chief Commissioner Afghan Refugees and lastly as Chief Editor in the Academy of Letters. Jafri emerged as one of the most respected and acclaimed humourists. Known as a prose writer and a columnist, he had a knack of combining serious, grim facts with humor. His seldom use of irony, burlesque, or horse laughter was non-serious, and sometimes even nonsensical as defined in literary criticism. This can be seen through his popular collection “Ma Fiz Zamir”. This anthology reveals how Jafri dealt with the reality of cruel, bitter, uncivilized situations and unreasonably aggressive people through the use of amusement. He proved himself as a humorist by rendering them in such a manner to not betray his satire nature by becoming a cruel and mocking comic. Jafri left a mark of his own, making him the most sought after poet in poetry recitals (Mushiara).

Sir John de Courcy (also Courci; 1150–1219)\\"John de Courci\\" in Encyclopædia Britannica was an Anglo-Norman knight who arrived in Ireland in 1176. From then until his expulsion in 1204, he conquered a considerable territory, endowed religious establishments, built abbeys for both the Benedictines and the Cistercians and built strongholds at Dundrum Castle in County Down and Carrickfergus Castle in County Antrim.DeBreffny Castles of Ireland, pp. 104–105. Early career in Ireland Belonging to a family which took its name from Courcy, Calvados, John de Courcy, of Stoke Courcy, in Somerset, came to Ireland around the year 1171 as part of the Norman invading forces, brought in as mercenaries working for Diarmaid Mac Murchadha, the ousted King of Leinster, to help him regain his position as king. De Courcy's great-grandfather, Richard de Curci is named in the Domesday Book.read online His grandfather, William de Courcy I, married Emma of Falaise. His father, William de Courcy II, married Avice de Meschines and died about 1155, leaving the family estates in Somerset and elsewhere in England to his son, William de Courcy III, John's elder brother. John was very ambitious and wanted lands for himself. He decided to invade the north of Ireland which was controlled by Irish dynasties. In early January 1177 he assembled a small army of 22 knights and 300 foot-soldiers and marched north, at the rate of thirty miles a day. They skirted the back of the Mourne Mountains and took the town of Dún Dá Leathghlas (now Downpatrick) by surprise. After two fierce battles, in February and June 1177, de Courcy defeated the last King of Ulaid, Ruaidhrí Mac Duinnshléibhe. He did all this without King Henry II's permission. After conquering eastern Ulster he established his caput at Carrickfergus, where he built an impressive stone castle. Other monasteries and castles that he built are Inch Abbey and Dundrum. He married Affreca, daughter of Godred II Olafsson, King of Mann. It is likely that the marriage, as in the case of many kings and those aspiring to be kings in those days, was political, to seal an alliance with her father who paid homage to the King of Norway. John and Affreca are not recorded to have had any children. Affreca built a monastery at Greyabbey dedicated to Saint Mary of The Yoke of God. She is buried there and her effigy, in stone, can still be seen. In 1183, de Courcy provided for the establishment of a priory at the cathedral of Down with generous endowments to the Benedictines from Chester in England (free from all subjugation to Chester Cathedral). This building was destroyed by an earthquake in 1245. He also created a cell for Benedictines at St. Andrews in the Ards (Black Abbey) for the houses of Stoke Courcy in Somerset and Lonlay in France, which was near Inishargy, Kircubbin, in present-day County Down. The early Irish monastery of Nendrum was given to the Benedictine house of St Bees in Cumberland in order that they might also establish a cell. His wife, Affreca, founded the Cistercian monastery of Grey Abbey, Co. Down, as a daughter house of Holm Cultram (Cumberland) in 1193. He also made incursions into the west to increase his territory and lordship. In 1188 he invaded Connacht, but was repulsed and the next year he plundered Armagh.DeBreffny Churches and Abbeys of Ireland, pp. 60–61. Later career in Ireland After the accession of Richard I in 1189, de Courcy in conjunction with William de Lacy appears in some way to have offended the king by his proceedings in Ireland. De Lacy quickly made his peace with Richard, while de Courci defied him, and the subsequent history of the latter consisted mainly in the vicissitudes of a lasting feud with the de Lacys. Hugh de Lacy, younger son of Hugh de Lacy Lord of Meath, began to wage war on John de Courcy, capturing him in 1204.Mac Annaidh Dictionary of Irish History An account of his capture appears in the Book of Howth. This passage helps explain why John had a reputation as a strong, God-fearing warrior: In May 1205, King John made Hugh Earl of Ulster, granting him all the land of the province \\"as John de Courcy held it on the day when Hugh defeated him\\". John de Courcy returned, sailing across the Irish sea from the Isle of Man in July 1205 with Norse soldiers and a hundred boats supplied by his brother-in-law, Ragnold, King of Mann. John and his army landed at Strangford and laid siege to Dundrum Castle in vain, because the defences he himself had made were too strong. King John then had John de Courcy imprisoned and he spent the rest of his life in poverty. He was subsequently released when he \\"crossed himself\\" to go on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. De Courcy died in obscurity just outside what is now Craigavon. Literary references The story of John de Courcy's defeat of the French champion, and his winning the privilege to remain covered in the presence of the King, appears in Chapter 12 of Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper. In his book Saint Patrick's Town, Anthony M.

A number of different classification schemes have arisen, and though they share some similarities, there are differences due in part to the different purposes they serve. In addition, as mathematics continues to be developed, these classification schemes must change as well to account for newly created areas or newly discovered links between different areas. Classification is made more difficult by some subjects, often the most active, which straddle the boundary between different areas. A traditional division of mathematics is into pure mathematics, mathematics studied for its intrinsic interest, and applied mathematics, mathematics that can be directly applied to real world problems.For example the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition groups its mathematics articles as Pure, Applied, and Biographies. This division is not always clear and many subjects have been developed as pure mathematics to find unexpected applications later on. Broad divisions, such as discrete mathematics and computational mathematics, have emerged more recently. An ideal system of classification permits adding new areas into the organization of previous knowledge, and fitting surprising discoveries and unexpected interactions into the outline. For example, the Langlands program has found unexpected connections between areas previously thought unconnected, at least Galois groups, Riemann surfaces and number theory. Classification systems *The Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC) is produced by the staff of the review databases Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt MATH. Many mathematics journals ask authors to label their papers with MSC subject codes. The MSC divides mathematics into over 60 areas, with further subdivisions within each area. *In the Library of Congress Classification, mathematics is assigned the many subclass QA within the class Q (Science). The LCC defines broad divisions, and individual subjects are assigned specific numerical values. *The Dewey Decimal Classification assigns mathematics to division 510, with subdivisions for Algebra & number theory, Arithmetic, Topology, Analysis, Geometry, Numerical analysis, and Probabilities & applied mathematics. *The Categories within Mathematics list is used by the arXiv for categorizing preprints. It differs from MSC; for example, it includes things like quantum algebra. *The IMU uses its programme structure for organizing the lectures at its four-yearly ICM. One top-level section that MSC doesn't have is Lie theory. *The ACM Computing Classification System includes a couple of mathematical categories F. Theory of Computation and G. Mathematics of Computing. *MathOverflow has a tag system. *Mathematics book publishers such as Springer (subdisciplines), Cambridge (Browse Mathematics and statistics) and the AMS (subject area) use their own subject lists on their websites to enable customers to browse books or filter searches by subdiscipline, including topics such as mathematical biology and mathematical finance as top- level headings. *Schools and other educational bodies have syllabuses. *Research institutes and university mathematics departments often have sub- departments or study groups. e.g. SIAM has activity groups for its members. *Wikipedia uses a : Mathematics system on its articles, and also has a list of mathematics lists. Major divisions of mathematics=Pure mathematicsFoundations= ;including set theory and mathematical logic Mathematicians have always worked with logic and symbols, but for centuries the underlying laws of logic were taken for granted, and never expressed symbolically. Mathematical logic, also known as symbolic logic, was developed when people finally realized that the tools of mathematics can be used to study the structure of logic itself. Areas of research in this field have expanded rapidly, and are usually subdivided into several distinct subfields. :;Proof theory and constructive mathematics :: Proof theory grew out of David Hilbert's ambitious program to formalize all the proofs in mathematics. The most famous result in the field is encapsulated in Gödel's incompleteness theorems. A closely related and now quite popular concept is the idea of Turing machines. Constructivism is the outgrowth of Brouwer's unorthodox view of the nature of logic itself; constructively speaking, mathematicians cannot assert \\"Either a circle is round, or it is not\\" until they have actually exhibited a circle and measured its roundness. :;Model theory :: Model theory studies mathematical structures in a general framework. Its main tool is first-order logic. :;Set theory :: A set can be thought of as a collection of distinct things united by some common feature. Set theory is subdivided into three main areas. Naive set theory is the original set theory developed by mathematicians at the end of the 19th century. Axiomatic set theory is a rigorous axiomatic theory developed in response to the discovery of serious flaws (such as Russell's paradox) in naive set theory. It treats sets as \\"whatever satisfies the axioms\\", and the notion of collections of things serves only as motivation for the axioms. Internal set theory is an axiomatic extension of set theory that supports a logically consistent identification of illimited (enormously large) and infinitesimal (unimaginably small) elements within the real numbers. See also List of set theory topics. ;History and biography The history of mathematics is inextricably intertwined with the subject itself. This is perfectly natural: mathematics has an internal organic structure, deriving new theorems from those that have come before. As each new generation of mathematicians builds upon the achievements of their ancestors, the subject itself expands and grows new layers, like an onion. ;Recreational mathematics From magic squares to the Mandelbrot set, numbers have been a source of amusement and delight for millions of people throughout the ages. Many important branches of \\"serious\\" mathematics have their roots in what was once a mere puzzle and/or game. =Number Theory= Number theory is the study of numbers and the properties of operations between them. Number theory is traditionally concerned with the properties of integers, but more recently, it has come to be concerned with wider classes of problems that have arisen naturally from the study of integers. :; Arithmetic :: An elementary part of number theory that primarily focuses upon the study of natural numbers, integers, fractions, and decimals, as well as the properties of the traditional operations on them: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Up until the 19th century, arithmetic and number theory were synonyms, but the evolution and growth of the field has resulted in arithmetic referring only to the elementary branch of number theory. :; Elementary number theory :: The study of integers at a higher level than arithmetic, where the term 'elementary' here refers to the fact that no techniques from other mathematical fields are used. :; Analytic number theory :: Calculus and complex analysis are used as tools to study the integers. :; Algebraic number theory :: The techniques of abstract algebra are used to study the integers, as well as algebraic numbers, the roots of polynomials with integer coefficients. :; Other number theory subfields :: Geometric number theory; combinatorial number theory; transcendental number theory; and computational number theory. See also the list of number theory topics. =Algebra= The study of structure begins with numbers, first the familiar natural numbers and integers and their arithmetical operations, which are recorded in elementary algebra. The deeper properties of these numbers are studied in number theory. The investigation of methods to solve equations leads to the field of abstract algebra, which, among other things, studies rings and fields, structures that generalize the properties possessed by everyday numbers. Long standing questions about compass and straightedge constructions were finally settled by Galois theory. The physically important concept of vectors, generalized to vector spaces, is studied in linear algebra. Themes common to all kinds of algebraic structures are studied in universal algebra. :; Order theory :: For any two distinct real numbers, one must be greater than the other. Order theory extends this idea to sets in general. It includes notions like lattices and ordered algebraic structures. See also the order theory glossary and the list of order topics. :; General algebraic systems :: Given a set, different ways of combining or relating members of that set can be defined. If these obey certain rules, then a particular algebraic structure is formed. Universal algebra is the more formal study of these structures and systems. :; Field theory and polynomials :: Field theory studies the properties of fields. A field is a mathematical entity for which addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are well- defined. A polynomial is an expression in which constants and variables are combined using only addition, subtraction, and multiplication. :; Commutative rings and algebras :: In ring theory, a branch of abstract algebra, a commutative ring is a ring in which the multiplication operation obeys the commutative law. This means that if a and b are any elements of the ring, then a×b = b×a. Commutative algebra is the field of study of commutative rings and their ideals, modules and algebras. It is foundational both for algebraic geometry and for algebraic number theory. The most prominent examples of commutative rings are rings of polynomials. =Combinatorics= Combinatorics is the study of finite or discrete collections of objects that satisfy specified criteria. In particular, it is concerned with \\"counting\\" the objects in those collections (enumerative combinatorics) and with deciding whether certain \\"optimal\\" objects exist (extremal combinatorics). It includes graph theory, used to describe inter-connected objects (a graph in this sense is a network, or collection of connected points). See also the list of combinatorics topics, list of graph theory topics and glossary of graph theory. A combinatorial flavour is present in many parts of problem-solving. =Geometry= Geometry deals with spatial relationships, using fundamental qualities or axioms. Such axioms can be used in conjunction with mathematical definitions for points, straight lines, curves, surfaces, and solids to draw logical conclusions. See also List of geometry topics. :;Convex geometry :: Includes the study of objects such as polytopes and polyhedra. See also List of convexity topics. :;Discrete geometry and combinatorial geometry :: The study of geometrical objects and properties that are discrete or combinatorial, either by their nature or by their representation. It includes the study of shapes such as the Platonic solids and the notion of tessellation. :;Differential geometry :: The study of geometry using calculus. It is very closely related to differential topology. Covers such areas as Riemannian geometry, curvature and differential geometry of curves. See also the glossary of differential geometry and topology. :;Algebraic geometry :: Given a polynomial of two real variables, the points on a plane where that function is zero will form a curve. An algebraic curve extends this notion to polynomials over a field in a given number of variables. Algebraic geometry may be viewed as the study of these curves. See also the list of algebraic geometry topics and list of algebraic surfaces. ::;Arithmetic geometry ::: The study of schemes of finite type over the spectrum of the ring of integers. Alternatively defined as the application of the techniques of algebraic geometry to problems in number theory. ::;Diophantine geometry ::: The study of the points of algebraic varieties with coordinates in fields that are not algebraically closed and occur in algebraic number theory, such as the field of rational numbers, number fields, finite fields, function fields, and p-adic fields, but not including the real numbers. ::;Real algebraic geometry ::: The study of semialgebraic sets, i.e. real-number solutions to algebraic inequalities with real-number coefficients, and mappings between them. =Topology= Deals with the properties of a figure that do not change when the figure is continuously deformed. The main areas are point set topology (or general topology), algebraic topology, and the topology of manifolds, defined below. :;General topology :: Also called point set topology. Properties of topological spaces. Includes such notions as open and closed sets, compact spaces, continuous functions, convergence, separation axioms, metric spaces, dimension theory. See also the glossary of general topology and the list of general topology topics. :;Algebraic topology :: Properties of algebraic objects associated with a topological space and how these algebraic objects capture properties of such spaces. (Some of these algebraic objects are examples of functors.) Contains areas like homology theory, cohomology theory, homotopy theory, and homological algebra. Homotopy deals with homotopy groups (including the fundamental group) as well as simplicial complexes and CW complexes (also called cell complexes). See also the list of algebraic topology topics. :;Differential topology :: The field dealing with differentiable functions on differentiable manifolds, which can be thought of as an n-dimensional generalization of a surface in the usual 3-dimensional Euclidean space. =Mathematical Analysis= Within the world of mathematics, analysis is the branch that focuses on change: rates of change, accumulated change, and multiple things changing relative to (or independently of) one another. Modern analysis is a vast and rapidly expanding branch of mathematics that touches almost every other subdivision of the discipline, finding direct and indirect applications in topics as diverse as number theory, cryptography, and abstract algebra. It is also the language of science itself and is used across chemistry, biology, and physics, from astrophysics to X-ray crystallography. Applied mathematicsProbability and statistics= *Probability theory: The mathematical theory of random phenomena. Probability theory studies random variables and events, which are mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic events or measured quantities. See also :probability theory, and the list of probability topics. **Stochastic processes: An extension of probability theory that studies collections of random variables, such as time series or spatial processes. See also List of stochastic processes topics, and :Stochastic processes. *Statistics: The science of making effective use of numerical data from experiments or from populations of individuals. Statistics includes not only the collection, analysis and interpretation of such data, but also the planning of the collection of data, in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. See also the list of statistical topics. =Computational sciences= ;Numerical analysis : Many problems in mathematics cannot in general be solved exactly. Numerical analysis is the study of iterative methods and algorithms for approximately solving problems to a specified error bound. Includes numerical differentiation, numerical integration and numerical methods; c.f. scientific computing. See also List of numerical analysis topics. ;Computer algebra : This area is also called symbolic computation or algebraic computation. It deals with exact computation, for example with integers of arbitrary size, polynomials or elements of finite fields. It includes also the computation with non numeric mathematical objects like polynomial ideals or series. =Mathematical physics= ; Classical Mechanics : Addresses and describes the motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to parts of machinery, and astronomical objects, such as spacecraft, planets, stars and galaxies. . : ; Mechanics of structures : Mechanics of structures is a field of study within applied mechanics that investigates the behavior of structures under mechanical loads, such as bending of a beam, buckling of a column, torsion of a shaft, deflection of a thin shell, and vibration of a bridge. : ; Mechanics of deformable solids : Most real-world objects are not point-like nor perfectly rigid. More importantly, objects change shape when subjected to forces. This subject has a very strong overlap with continuum mechanics, which is concerned with continuous matter. It deals with such notions as stress, strain and elasticity. : ; Fluid mechanics : Fluids in this sense includes not just liquids, but flowing gases, and even solids under certain situations. (For example, dry sand can behave like a fluid). It includes such notions as viscosity, turbulent flow and laminar flow (its opposite). : ; Particle mechanics : In mathematics, a particle is a point-like, perfectly rigid, solid object. Particle mechanics deals with the results of subjecting particles to forces. It includes celestial mechanics—the study of the motion of celestial objects. =Other applied mathematics= *Operations research (OR), also known as operational research, provides optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex problems. OR uses mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and mathematical optimization. *Mathematical programming (or mathematical optimization) minimizes (or maximizes) a real-valued function over a domain that is often specified by constraints on the variables. Mathematical programming studies these problems and develops iterative methods and algorithms for their solution.

Throughout the article, unless otherwise stated, a Lie algebra is a finite- dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic 0. For such a Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g, if nonzero, the following conditions are equivalent: *\\\\mathfrak g is semisimple; *the Killing form, κ(x,y) = tr(ad(x)ad(y)), is non-degenerate; *\\\\mathfrak g has no non-zero abelian ideals; *\\\\mathfrak g has no non-zero solvable ideals; * the radical (maximal solvable ideal) of \\\\mathfrak g is zero.  Significance  The significance of semisimplicity comes firstly from the Levi decomposition, which states that every finite dimensional Lie algebra is the semidirect product of a solvable ideal (its radical) and a semisimple algebra. In particular, there is no nonzero Lie algebra that is both solvable and semisimple. Semisimple Lie algebras have a very elegant classification, in stark contrast to solvable Lie algebras. Semisimple Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero are completely classified by their root system, which are in turn classified by Dynkin diagrams. Semisimple algebras over non-algebraically closed fields can be understood in terms of those over the algebraic closure, though the classification is somewhat more intricate; see real form for the case of real semisimple Lie algebras, which were classified by Élie Cartan. Further, the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras is much cleaner than that for general Lie algebras. For example, the Jordan decomposition in a semisimple Lie algebra coincides with the Jordan decomposition in its representation; this is not the case for Lie algebras in general. If \\\\mathfrak g is semisimple, then \\\\mathfrak g = [\\\\mathfrak g, \\\\mathfrak g]. In particular, every linear semisimple Lie algebra is a subalgebra of \\\\mathfrak{sl}, the special linear Lie algebra. The study of the structure of \\\\mathfrak{sl} constitutes an important part of the representation theory for semisimple Lie algebras.  History  The semisimple Lie algebras over the complex numbers were first classified by Wilhelm Killing (1888–90), though his proof lacked rigor. His proof was made rigorous by Élie Cartan (1894) in his Ph.D. thesis, who also classified semisimple real Lie algebras. This was subsequently refined, and the present classification by Dynkin diagrams was given by then 22-year-old Eugene Dynkin in 1947. Some minor modifications have been made (notably by J. P. Serre), but the proof is unchanged in its essentials and can be found in any standard reference, such as .  Basic properties  *Every ideal, quotient and product of semisimple Lie algebras is again semisimple. *The center of a semisimple Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g is trivial (since the center is an abelian ideal). In other words, the adjoint representation \\\\operatorname{ad} is injective. Moreover, the image turns outSince the Killing form B is non-degenerate, given a derivation D, there is an x such that \\\\operatorname{tr}(D\\\\operatorname{ad}y) = B(x, y) for all y and then, by an easy computation, D = \\\\operatorname{ad}(x). to be \\\\operatorname{Der}(\\\\mathfrak g) of derivations on \\\\mathfrak{g}. Hence, \\\\operatorname{ad}: \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\overset{\\\\sim}\\\\to \\\\operatorname{Der}(\\\\mathfrak g) is an isomorphism. (This is a special case of Whitehead's lemma.) *As the adjoint representation is injective, a semisimple Lie algebra is a linear Lie algebra under the adjoint representation. This may lead to some ambiguity, as every Lie algebra is already linear with respect to some other vector space (Ado's theorem), although not necessarily via the adjoint representation. But in practice, such ambiguity rarely occurs. *If \\\\mathfrak g is a semisimple Lie algebra, then \\\\mathfrak g = [\\\\mathfrak g, \\\\mathfrak g] (because \\\\mathfrak g/[\\\\mathfrak g, \\\\mathfrak g] is semisimple and abelian). *A finite-dimensional Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g over a field k of characteristic zero is semisimple if and only if the base extension \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\otimes_k F is semisimple for each field extension F \\\\supset k. Thus, for example, a finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is semisimple if and only if its complexification is semisimple. Jordan decomposition Each endomorphism x of a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic zero can be decomposed uniquely into a semisimple (i.e.., diagonalizable over the algebraic closure) and nilpotent part :x=s+n\\\\ such that s and n commute with each other. Moreover, each of s and n is a polynomial in x. This is the Jordan decomposition of x. The above applies to the adjoint representation \\\\operatorname{ad} of a semisimple Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g. An element x of \\\\mathfrak g is said to be semisimple (resp. nilpotent) if \\\\operatorname{ad}(x) is a semisimple (resp. nilpotent) operator. If x\\\\in\\\\mathfrak g, then the abstract Jordan decomposition states that x can be written uniquely as: :x = s + n where s is semisimple, n is nilpotent and [s, n] = 0. Moreover, if y \\\\in \\\\mathfrak g commutes with x, then it commutes with both s, n as well. The abstract Jordan decomposition factors through any representation of \\\\mathfrak g in the sense that given any representation ρ, :\\\\rho(x) = \\\\rho(s) + \\\\rho(n)\\\\, is the Jordan decomposition of ρ(x) in the endomorphism algebra of the representation space. (This is proved as a consequence of Weyl's complete reducibility theorem; see Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility#Application: preservation of Jordan decomposition.)  Structure  Let \\\\mathfrak g be a (finite-dimensional) semisimple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. The structure of \\\\mathfrak g can be described by an adjoint action of a certain distinguished subalgebra on it, a Cartan subalgebra. By definition,This is a definition of a Cartan subalgebra of a semisimple Lie algebra and coincides with the general one. a Cartan subalgebra (also called a maximal toral subalgebra) \\\\mathfrak h of \\\\mathfrak g is a maximal subalgebra such that, for each h \\\\in \\\\mathfrak h, \\\\operatorname{ad}(h) is diagonalizable. As it turns out, \\\\mathfrak h is abelian and so all the operators in \\\\operatorname{ad}(\\\\mathfrak h) are simultaneously diagonalizable. For each linear functional \\\\alpha of \\\\mathfrak h, let :\\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\alpha} = \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g}  [h, x] = \\\\alpha(h) x \\\\, \\\\text{ for all } h \\\\in \\\\mathfrak h \\\\\\\\}. (Note that \\\\mathfrak{g}_0 is the centralizer of \\\\mathfrak h.) Then (The most difficult item to show is \\\\dim \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\alpha} = 1. The standard proofs all use some facts in the representation theory of \\\\mathfrak{sl}_2; e.g., Serre uses the fact that an \\\\mathfrak{sl}_2-module with a primitive element of negative weight is infinite-dimensional, contradicting \\\\dim \\\\mathfrak g < \\\\infty.) Let h_{\\\\alpha} \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h}, e_{\\\\alpha} \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\alpha}, f_{\\\\alpha} \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g}_{-\\\\alpha} with the commutation relations [e_{\\\\alpha}, f_{\\\\alpha}] = h_{\\\\alpha}, [h_{\\\\alpha}, e_{\\\\alpha}] = 2e_{\\\\alpha}, [h_{\\\\alpha}, f_{\\\\alpha}] = -2f_{\\\\alpha}; i.e., the h_{\\\\alpha}, e_{\\\\alpha}, f_{\\\\alpha} correspond to the standard basis of \\\\mathfrak{sl}_2. The linear functionals in \\\\Phi are called the roots of \\\\mathfrak g relative to \\\\mathfrak h. The roots span \\\\mathfrak h^* (since if \\\\alpha(h) = 0, \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\Phi, then \\\\operatorname{ad}(h) is the zero operator; i.e., h is in the center, which is zero.) Moreover, from the representation theory of \\\\mathfrak{sl}_2, one deduces the following symmetry and integral properties of \\\\Phi: for each \\\\alpha, \\\\beta \\\\in \\\\Phi, Note that s_{\\\\alpha} has the properties (1) s_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\alpha) = -\\\\alpha and (2) the fixed-point set is \\\\\\\\{ \\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h}^*  \\\\gamma(h_\\\\alpha) = 0 \\\\\\\\}, which means that s_{\\\\alpha} is the reflection with respect to the hyperplane corresponding to \\\\alpha. The above then says that \\\\Phi is a root system. It follows from the general theory of a root system that \\\\Phi contains a basis \\\\alpha_1, \\\\dots, \\\\alpha_l of \\\\mathfrak{h}^* such that each root is a linear combination of \\\\alpha_1, \\\\dots, \\\\alpha_l with integer coefficients of the same sign; the roots \\\\alpha_i are called simple roots. Let e_i = e_{\\\\alpha_i}, etc. Then the 3l elements e_i, f_i, h_i (called Chevalley generators) generate \\\\mathfrak g as a Lie algebra. Moreover, they satisfy the relations (called Serre relations): with a_{ij} = \\\\alpha_j(h_i), :[h_i, h_j] = 0, :[e_i, f_i] = h_i, [e_i, f_j] = 0, i e j, :[h_i, e_j] = a_{ij} e_j, [h_i, f_j] = -a_{ij} f_j, :\\\\operatorname{ad}(e_i)^{-a_{ij} + 1}(e_j) = \\\\operatorname{ad}(f_i)^{-a_{ij} + 1}(f_j) = 0, i e j. The converse of this is also true: i.e., the Lie algebra generated by the generators and the relations like the above is a (finite-dimensional) semisimple Lie algebra that has the root space decomposition as above (provided the [a_{ij}]_{1 \\\\le i, j \\\\le l} is a Cartan matrix). This is a theorem of Serre. In particular, two semisimple Lie algebras are isomorphic if they have the same root system. The implication of the axiomatic nature of a root system and Serre's theorem is that one can enumerate all possible root systems; hence, \\"all possible\\" semisimple Lie algebras (finite-dimensional over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero). The Weyl group is the group of linear transformations of \\\\mathfrak{h}^* \\\\simeq \\\\mathfrak{h} generated by the s_\\\\alpha's. The Weyl group is an important symmetry of the problem; for example, the weights of any finite-dimensional representation of \\\\mathfrak{g} are invariant under the Weyl group. Theorem 9.3  Example root space decomposition in sln(C)  For \\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\mathfrak{sl}_n(\\\\mathbb{C}) and the Cartan subalgebra \\\\mathfrak{h} of diagonal matrices, define \\\\lambda_i \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h}^* by :\\\\lambda_i(d(a_1,\\\\ldots, a_n)) = a_i, where d(a_1,\\\\ldots, a_n) denotes the diagonal matrix with a_1,\\\\ldots, a_n on the diagonal. Then the decomposition is given by :\\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\mathfrak{h}\\\\oplus \\\\left( \\\\bigoplus_{i eq j} \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\lambda_i - \\\\lambda_j} \\\\right) where :\\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\lambda_i - \\\\lambda_j} = \\\\text{Span}_\\\\mathbb{C}(e_{ij}) for the vector e_{ij} in \\\\mathfrak{sl}_n(\\\\mathbb{C}) with the standard (matrix) basis, meaning e_{ij} represents the basis vector in the i-th row and j-th column. This decomposition of \\\\mathfrak{g} has an associated root system: :\\\\Phi = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\lambda_i - \\\\lambda_j : i eq j \\\\\\\\}  sl2(C)  For example, in \\\\mathfrak{sl}_2(\\\\mathbb{C}) the decomposition is :\\\\mathfrak{sl}_2= \\\\mathfrak{h}\\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\lambda_1 - \\\\lambda_2}\\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\lambda_2 - \\\\lambda_1} and the associated root system is :\\\\Phi = \\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda_1 - \\\\lambda_2, \\\\lambda_2 - \\\\lambda_1 \\\\\\\\}  sl3(C)  In \\\\mathfrak{sl}_3(\\\\mathbb{C}) the decomposition is :\\\\mathfrak{sl}_3 = \\\\mathfrak{h} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\lambda_1 - \\\\lambda_2} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\lambda_1 - \\\\lambda_3} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\lambda_2 - \\\\lambda_3} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\lambda_2 - \\\\lambda_1} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\lambda_3 - \\\\lambda_1} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\lambda_3 - \\\\lambda_2} and the associated root system is given by :\\\\Phi = \\\\\\\\{\\\\pm(\\\\lambda_1 - \\\\lambda_2),\\\\pm(\\\\lambda_1 - \\\\lambda_3),\\\\pm(\\\\lambda_2 - \\\\lambda_3) \\\\\\\\}  Examples  As noted in #Structure, semisimple Lie algebras over \\\\mathbb{C} (or more generally an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero) are classified by the root system associated to their Cartan subalgebras, and the root systems, in turn, are classified by their Dynkin diagrams. Examples of semisimple Lie algebras, with notation coming from their Dynkin diagrams, are: * A_n: \\\\mathfrak {sl}_{n+1}, the special linear Lie algebra. * B_n: \\\\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}, the odd-dimensional special orthogonal Lie algebra. * C_n: \\\\mathfrak {sp}_{2n}, the symplectic Lie algebra. * D_n: \\\\mathfrak{so}_{2n}, the even-dimensional special orthogonal Lie algebra (n>1). The restriction n>1 in the D_n family is needed because \\\\mathfrak{so}_{2} is one-dimensional and commutative and therefore not semisimple. These Lie algebras are numbered so that n is the rank. Almost all of these semisimple Lie algebras are actually simple and the members of these families are almost all distinct, except for some collisions in small rank. For example \\\\mathfrak{so}_{4} \\\\cong \\\\mathfrak{so}_{3} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{so}_{3} and \\\\mathfrak{sp}_{2} \\\\cong \\\\mathfrak{so}_{5}. These four families, together with five exceptions (E6, E7, E8, F4, and G2), are in fact the only simple Lie algebras over the complex numbers.  Classification  The simple Lie algebras are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams. Every semisimple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras (by definition), and the finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras fall in four families – An, Bn, Cn, and Dn – with five exceptions E6, E7, E8, F4, and G2. Simple Lie algebras are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams, shown on the right, while semisimple Lie algebras correspond to not necessarily connected Dynkin diagrams, where each component of the diagram corresponds to a summand of the decomposition of the semisimple Lie algebra into simple Lie algebras. The classification proceeds by considering a Cartan subalgebra (see below) and the adjoint action of the Lie algebra on this subalgebra. The root system of the action then both determines the original Lie algebra and must have a very constrained form, which can be classified by the Dynkin diagrams. See the section below describing Cartan subalgebras and root systems for more details. The classification is widely considered one of the most elegant results in mathematics – a brief list of axioms yields, via a relatively short proof, a complete but non-trivial classification with surprising structure. This should be compared to the classification of finite simple groups, which is significantly more complicated. The enumeration of the four families is non-redundant and consists only of simple algebras if n \\\\geq 1 for An, n \\\\geq 2 for Bn, n \\\\geq 3 for Cn, and n \\\\geq 4 for Dn. If one starts numbering lower, the enumeration is redundant, and one has exceptional isomorphisms between simple Lie algebras, which are reflected in isomorphisms of Dynkin diagrams; the En can also be extended down, but below E6 are isomorphic to other, non-exceptional algebras. Over a non-algebraically closed field, the classification is more complicated – one classifies simple Lie algebras over the algebraic closure, then for each of these, one classifies simple Lie algebras over the original field which have this form (over the closure). For example, to classify simple real Lie algebras, one classifies real Lie algebras with a given complexification, which are known as real forms of the complex Lie algebra; this can be done by Satake diagrams, which are Dynkin diagrams with additional data (\\"decorations\\"). Section VI.10 Representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras  Let \\\\mathfrak g be a (finite-dimensional) semisimple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Then, as in #Structure, \\\\mathfrak g = \\\\mathfrak h \\\\oplus \\\\bigoplus_{\\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\Phi} \\\\mathfrak g_{\\\\alpha} where \\\\Phi is the root system. Choose the simple roots in \\\\Phi; a root \\\\alpha of \\\\Phi is then called positive and is denoted by \\\\alpha > 0 if it is a linear combination of the simple roots with non-negative integers coefficients. Let \\\\mathfrak b = \\\\mathfrak h \\\\oplus \\\\bigoplus_{\\\\alpha > 0} \\\\mathfrak g_{\\\\alpha}, which is a maximal solvable subalgebra of \\\\mathfrak g, the Borel subalgebra. Let V be a (possibly-infinite-dimensional) simple \\\\mathfrak g-module. If V happens to admit a \\\\mathfrak b-weight vector v_0,A \\\\mathfrak{b}-weight vector is also called a primitive element, especially in older textbooks. then it is unique up to scaling and is called the highest weight vector of V. It is also an \\\\mathfrak h-weight vector and the \\\\mathfrak h-weight of v_0, a linear functional of \\\\mathfrak h, is called the highest weight of V. The basic yet nontrivial factsIn textbooks, these facts is usually established by the theory of Verma modules. then are (1) to each linear functional \\\\mu \\\\in \\\\mathfrak h^*, there exists a simple \\\\mathfrak g-module V^{\\\\mu} having \\\\mu as its highest weight and (2) two simple modules having the same highest weight are equivalent. In short, there exists a bijection between \\\\mathfrak h^* and the set of the equivalence classes of simple \\\\mathfrak g-modules admitting a Borel-weight vector. For applications, one is often interested in a finite- dimensional simple \\\\mathfrak g-module (a finite-dimensional irreducible representation). This is especially the case when \\\\mathfrak g is the Lie algebra of a Lie group (or complexification of such), since, via the Lie correspondence, a Lie algebra representation can be integrated to a Lie group representation when the obstructions are overcome. The next criterion then addresses this need: by the positive Weyl chamber C \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{h}^*, we mean the convex cone C = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mu \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h}^*  \\\\mu(h_{\\\\alpha}) \\\\ge 0, \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\Phi > 0 \\\\\\\\} where h_{\\\\alpha} \\\\in [\\\\mathfrak g_{\\\\alpha}, \\\\mathfrak g_{-\\\\alpha}] is a unique vector such that \\\\alpha(h_{\\\\alpha}) = 2. The criterion then reads: *\\\\dim V^{\\\\mu} < \\\\infty if and only if, for each positive root \\\\alpha > 0, (1) \\\\mu(h_{\\\\alpha}) is an integer and (2) \\\\mu lies in C. A linear functional \\\\mu satisfying the above equivalent condition is called a dominant integral weight. Hence, in summary, there exists a bijection between the dominant integral weights and the equivalence classes of finite- dimensional simple \\\\mathfrak g-modules, the result known as the theorem of the highest weight. The character of a finite-dimensional simple module in turns is computed by the Weyl character formula. The theorem due to Weyl says that, over a field of characteristic zero, every finite-dimensional module of a semisimple Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g is completely reducible; i.e., it is a direct sum of simple \\\\mathfrak g-modules. Hence, the above results then apply to finite-dimensional representations of a semisimple Lie algebra.  Real semisimple Lie algebra  For a semisimple Lie algebra over a field that has characteristic zero but is not algebraically closed, there is no general structure theory like the one for those over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. But over the field of real numbers, there are still the structure results. Let \\\\mathfrak g be a finite-dimensional real semisimple Lie algebra and \\\\mathfrak{g}^{\\\\mathbb{C}} = \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb{R}} \\\\mathbb{C} the complexification of it (which is again semisimple). The real Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g is called a real form of \\\\mathfrak{g}^{\\\\mathbb{C}}. A real form is called a compact form if the Killing form on it is negative- definite; it is necessarily the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group (hence, the name).  Compact case  Suppose \\\\mathfrak g is a compact form and \\\\mathfrak h \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak g a maximal abelian subspace. One can show (for example, from the fact \\\\mathfrak g is the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group) that \\\\operatorname{ad}(\\\\mathfrak h) consists of skew-Hermitian matrices, diagonalizable over \\\\mathbb{C} with imaginary eigenvalues. Hence, \\\\mathfrak h^{\\\\mathbb{C}} is a Cartan subalgebra of \\\\mathfrak{g}^{\\\\mathbb{C}} and there results in the root space decomposition (cf. #Structure) :\\\\mathfrak{g}^{\\\\mathbb{C}} = \\\\mathfrak{h}^{\\\\mathbb{C}} \\\\oplus \\\\bigoplus_{\\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\Phi} \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\alpha} where each \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\Phi is real-valued on i \\\\mathfrak{h}; thus, can be identified with a real-linear functional on the real vector space i \\\\mathfrak{h}. For example, let \\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\mathfrak{su}(n) and take \\\\mathfrak h \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak g the subspace of all diagonal matrices. Note \\\\mathfrak{g}^{\\\\mathbb{C}} = \\\\mathfrak{sl}_n \\\\mathbb{C}. Let e_i be the linear functional on \\\\mathfrak{h}^{\\\\mathbb{C}} given by e_i(H) = h_i for H = \\\\operatorname{diag}(h_1, \\\\dots, h_n). Then for each H \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h}^{\\\\mathbb{C}}, :[H, E_{ij}] = (e_i(H) - e_j(H)) E_{ij} where E_{ij} is the matrix that has 1 on the (i, j)-th spot and zero elsewhere. Hence, each root \\\\alpha is of the form \\\\alpha = e_i - e_j, i e j and the root space decomposition is the decomposition of matrices: :\\\\mathfrak{g}^{\\\\mathbb{C}} = \\\\mathfrak{h}^{\\\\mathbb{C}} \\\\oplus \\\\bigoplus_{i e j} \\\\mathbb{C} E_{ij}.  Noncompact case  Suppose \\\\mathfrak g is not necessarily a compact form (i.e., the signature of the Killing form is not all negative). Suppose, moreover, it has a Cartan involution \\\\theta and let \\\\mathfrak g = \\\\mathfrak k \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak p be the eigenspace decomposition of \\\\theta, where \\\\mathfrak k, \\\\mathfrak p are the eigenspaces for 1 and -1, respectively. For example, if \\\\mathfrak g = \\\\mathfrak{sl}_n \\\\mathbb{R} and \\\\theta the negative transpose, then \\\\mathfrak k = \\\\mathfrak{so}(n). Let \\\\mathfrak a \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak p be a maximal abelian subspace. Now, \\\\operatorname{ad}(\\\\mathfrak p) consists of symmetric matrices (with respect to a suitable inner product) and thus the operators in \\\\operatorname{ad}(\\\\mathfrak a) are simultaneously diagonalizable, with real eigenvalues. By repeating the arguments for the algebraically closed base field, one obtains the decomposition (called the restricted root space decomposition): :\\\\mathfrak g = \\\\mathfrak g_0 \\\\oplus \\\\bigoplus_{\\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\Phi} \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\alpha} where *the elements in \\\\Phi are called the restricted roots, *\\\\theta(\\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\alpha}) = \\\\mathfrak{g}_{-\\\\alpha} for any linear functional \\\\alpha; in particular, -\\\\Phi \\\\subset \\\\Phi, *\\\\mathfrak g_0 = \\\\mathfrak a \\\\oplus Z_{\\\\mathfrak k}(\\\\mathfrak a). Moreover, \\\\Phi is a root system but not necessarily reduced one (i.e., it can happen \\\\alpha, 2\\\\alpha are both roots).  The case of \\\\mathrm{sl}(n,\\\\mathbb{C})  If \\\\mathfrak{g}=\\\\mathrm{sl}(n,\\\\mathbb{C}), then \\\\mathfrak{h} may be taken to be the diagonal subalgebra of \\\\mathfrak{g}, consisting of diagonal matrices whose diagonal entries sum to zero. Since \\\\mathfrak{h} has dimension n-1, we see that \\\\mathrm{sl}(n;\\\\mathbb{C}) has rank n-1. The root vectors X in this case may be taken to be the matrices E_{i,j} with i eq j, where E_{i,j} is the matrix with a 1 in the (i,j) spot and zeros elsewhere. Section 7.7.1 If H is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries \\\\lambda_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\lambda_n, then we have :[H,E_{i,j}]=(\\\\lambda_i-\\\\lambda_j)E_{i,j}. Thus, the roots for \\\\mathrm{sl}(n,\\\\mathbb{C}) are the linear functionals \\\\alpha_{i,j} given by :\\\\alpha_{i,j}(H)=\\\\lambda_i-\\\\lambda_j. After identifying \\\\mathfrak{h} with its dual, the roots become the vectors \\\\alpha_{i,j}:=e_i-e_j in the space of n-tuples that sum to zero. This is the root system known as A_{n-1} in the conventional labeling. The reflection associated to the root \\\\alpha_{i,j} acts on \\\\mathfrak{h} by transposing the i and j diagonal entries. The Weyl group is then just the permutation group on n elements, acting by permuting the diagonal entries of matrices in \\\\mathfrak{h}.  Generalizations  Semisimple Lie algebras admit certain generalizations. Firstly, many statements that are true for semisimple Lie algebras are true more generally for reductive Lie algebras. Abstractly, a reductive Lie algebra is one whose adjoint representation is completely reducible, while concretely, a reductive Lie algebra is a direct sum of a semisimple Lie algebra and an abelian Lie algebra; for example, \\\\mathfrak{sl}_n is semisimple, and \\\\mathfrak{gl}_n is reductive. Many properties of semisimple Lie algebras depend only on reducibility. Many properties of complex semisimple/reductive Lie algebras are true not only for semisimple/reductive Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields, but more generally for split semisimple/reductive Lie algebras over other fields: semisimple/reductive Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields are always split, but over other fields this is not always the case. Split Lie algebras have essentially the same representation theory as semsimple Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields, for instance, the splitting Cartan subalgebra playing the same role as the Cartan subalgebra plays over algebraically closed fields. This is the approach followed in , for instance, which classifies representations of split semisimple/reductive Lie algebras. Semisimple and reductive groups A connected Lie group is called semisimple if its Lie algebra is a semisimple Lie algebra, i.e. a direct sum of simple Lie algebras. It is called reductive if its Lie algebra is a direct sum of simple and trivial (one-dimensional) Lie algebras. Reductive groups occur naturally as symmetries of a number of mathematical objects in algebra, geometry, and physics. For example, the group GL_n(\\\\mathbb{R}) of symmetries of an n-dimensional real vector space (equivalently, the group of invertible matrices) is reductive.

Some news coverage was also given to the Atari Lynx and Jaguar in the later stages of its life. ST Action was launched in April 1988 by Gollner Publishing, becoming the first dedicated games magazine for the 16-bit Atari platform. The original team included Hugh Gollner (Publisher), Nick Clarkson (Editor), Steve Merrett, Jason Spiller and Martin Moth (Writers), Greg Percvial (Design). In 1990, Gollner Publishing merged with Europress Interactive, and ST Action made the transition to Europress, under which it would be published for the remainder of its lifespan. During this time, ST Action also proved a useful training ground for a number of gaming journalists including Doug Johns, Paul McNally, Jason Dutton, Alan Bunker and Steve White. The magazine used digital technology to capture game screenshots, becoming the first video game magazine in the world to do so. Games magazines traditionally took screenshots using a camera positioned in front of the screen. Ian Tindale found that he could use Mac-based technology to perform the image capture, saving time and cost. Competitors For much of its lifespan, it was the only video game magazine dedicated to the Atari ST. Its competitors, including ST Format and Atari ST User, covered a combination of games and technical subjects associated with the machine. This changed in May 1991 with the launch of The One for ST Games by EMAP Publishing. Both magazines co-existing until April 1992, when it was revealed that Europress Interactive had bought The One for ST Games and incorporated it into ST Action. The May 1992 edition (issue 49) promoted the merger, declaring it to be \\"TWO great mags for the price of one!\\". However, in reality there was little change to the magazine beyond the addition of The One ST logo and a minor redesign to the news pages. Decline The number of game releases for the Atari ST slowed during 1992, resulting in a decrease from 100 pages in the January 1992 edition to 76 pages in the December 1992 issue. The majority of issues published in 1993 contained 68 pages, the majority of which were dedicated to re-released games and regular content (news, letters, tips, help guides, subscription, etc.). The final issue (#67, November 1993) was published in October 1993, after which it was incorporated into Atari ST User. ST Action served as the games section for Atari ST User for several issues until Atari ST User was closed in November 1994. It was subsequently adopted by Atari ST Review with the December 1994 edition and continued until its closure.

Doyle ranked \\"The Adventure of the Naval Treaty\\" 19th in a list of his 19 favourite Sherlock Holmes stories.Trivia on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Favorite Sherlock Holmes Stories  Trivia Library Synopsis Holmes holding a rose, drawn by Sidney Paget. \\"Our highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to rest in the flowers...\\" Dr. Watson receives a letter, which he then refers to Holmes, from an old schoolmate, Percy Phelps, now a Foreign Office employee from Woking who has had an important naval treaty stolen from his office. It disappeared while Phelps had stepped out of his office momentarily late in the evening to see about some coffee that he had ordered. His office has two entrances, each joined by a stairway to a single landing. The commissionaire kept watch at the main entrance. There was no one watching at the side entrance. Phelps also knew that his fiancée Annie Harrison's brother Joseph was in town and that he might drop by. Phelps was alone in the office. Phelps pulled the bell cord in his office to summon the commissionaire, and to his surprise the commissionaire's wife came up instead. He worked at copying the treaty that he had been given while he waited. At last, he went to see the commissionaire when it had taken some time for the coffee to arrive. He found him asleep with the kettle boiling furiously. He did not need to wake him up, however, as just then, the bell linked to his office rang. Realizing that someone was in his office with the treaty still spread out on his desk, Phelps rushed back up and found that the document had vanished, as had the thief. It seemed obvious that the thief had come in through the side entrance; otherwise he would have passed Phelps on the stairs at some point, and there were no hiding places in his office. No footprints were seen in the office despite its being a rainy evening. The only suspect at that point was the commissionaire's wife, who had quickly hurried out of the building at about that same time. This was followed up, but no treaty was found with her. Other suspects were the commissionaire himself and Phelps's colleague Charles Gorot. Neither seemed a very likely suspect, but the police followed them both, and the commissionaire's wife. As expected, nothing came of it. Phelps was driven to despair by the incident, and when he got back to Woking, he was immediately put to bed in his fiancée's brother's room. There he remained, sick with \\"brain fever\\" for more than two months, his reputation and honour apparently gone. Holmes is quite interested in this case, and makes a number of observations that others seem to have missed. The absence of footprints, for instance, might indicate that the thief came by cab. There is also the remarkable fact that the dire consequences that ought to result from such a treaty being divulged to a foreign government have not happened in all the time that Phelps has been ill. Why was the bell rung? Holmes gathers some useful information at Briarbrae, the Phelps house, where Phelps' fiancée and her brother have also been staying. She has been nursing him days while a hired nurse kept watch over him at night. Joseph also remains to be of service if he can. After seeing Phelps at Woking, Holmes makes some inquiries in town. He visits Lord Holdhurst, Phelps's uncle, the Foreign Secretary, who gave his nephew his important task of copying the treaty, but Holmes dismisses him as a suspect, and is quite sure now that no one could have overheard their discussion about the task. Lord Holdhurst reveals to Holmes the potentially disastrous consequences that might occur if the treaty should fall into the hands of the French or Russian embassies. Fortunately, nothing has yet happened, despite the many weeks since the theft. Apparently, the thief has not yet sold the treaty, and Lord Holdhurst informs Holmes that the villain's time is running out, as the treaty will soon cease to be a secret. Why, then, has the thief not sold the treaty? Holmes returns to Woking, not having given up, but having to report that no treaty has turned up yet. Meanwhile, something interesting has happened at Briarbrae: someone tried to break in during the night, into Phelps's sick-room, no less. Phelps surprised him at the window but could not see his face through the hooded cloak that he was wearing. He did, however, see the interloper's knife as he dashed away. This happened the very first night that Phelps felt he could do without the nurse. Unknown to anyone else at this point--although Watson infers it from his friend's taciturnity--Holmes knows what is going on. He orders Annie to stay in her fiancé's sick room all day, and then to leave it and lock it from the outside when she finally goes to bed. This she does. Holmes finds a hiding place near Briarbrae to keep watch after having sent Watson and Phelps to London on the train, and also letting the occupants at Briarbrae believe that he intended to go with them, ostensibly to keep Phelps out of harm's way should the interloper come back. Holmes waits until about two o'clock in the morning, when the interloper appears--out of the house's tradesman's entrance. He goes to the window, gets it open as before, opens a hidden hatch in the floor, and pulls out the treaty. He then steps straight back out the window and Holmes intercepts him after which they fight, with Holmes emerging victorious but having suffered minor injuries. The treaty has been in Phelps's sick room all the time, while the thief, Joseph, who usually slept in that room, could not get to it. He rang the bell in Phelps's office after dropping by to visit and finding him not there, but then he saw the treaty and at once realized its potential value. His inability to reach the treaty explains why there have been no dire political consequences. Holmes explains that Joseph had lost a great deal of money on the stock market, which explains his need for money. Being a very desperate and selfish man, he cared nothing for the consequences Phelps might suffer from the document's loss. Always one with a flair for the dramatic, Holmes has the treaty literally served up to Phelps as breakfast the next morning at 221B Baker Street, London, where he has spent the night under Watson's watchful eyes (although there has been no danger). Phelps is ecstatic, Holmes is quietly triumphant, and once again, Watson is dumbfounded. Holmes explains that several clues all pointed to Joseph: the thief knew the ways of the office well, given that he had rung the bell just before seeing the treaty; Phelps had shown his relatives around the office; Joseph had dined in London that evening, and took the 11:00 PM train to Woking; Phelps expected to meet him for the train; the theft happened at about 9:40 PM; it was a rainy night, but there were no wet footprints in the passage or office, so the thief had come in a cab; and the burglar who tried to break into Phelps' room was familiar with the layout of the house and the habits of those who lived there. Commentary This is the longest of the short stories published in The Strand Magazine before Sherlock Holmes's \\"death\\" in \\"The Final Problem\\". As such, it was originally published in two parts. This story contains the first reference to \\"The Adventure of the Second Stain\\", which would not be published until around 11 years later, although the facts of the later-written story are different from those mentioned by Watson in \\"The Naval Treaty.\\" Publication history \\"The Adventure of the Naval Treaty\\" was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in October and November 1893, and in the US in Harper's Weekly on 14 and 21 October 1893. It was also published in the US edition of the Strand one month after its UK publication.Smith (2014), p. 99. The story was published with eight illustrations by Sidney Paget in The Strand Magazine in October 1893, and with seven illustrations by Paget in November 1893.Cawthorne (2011), p. 92. It was included in the short story collection The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.Cawthorne (2011), p. 75. Adaptations=Film and television One of the short films in the Sherlock Holmes Éclair film series (1912) was based on the story. In the short film, titled The Stolen Papers, Georges Tréville played Sherlock Holmes and Mr Moyse played Dr. Watson. Another short film based on the story was released in 1922 as part of the Sherlock Holmes Stoll film series, with Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson. The story was adapted for the 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost. The story was adapted as the 1984 episode \\"The Naval Treaty\\" from the first series of the Granada TV series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which stars Jeremy Brett. \\"The Great Game\\" (2010), the third episode of the television series Sherlock, uses \\"The Adventure of the Naval Treaty\\" and \\"The Adventure of the Bruce- Partington Plans\\" as inspiration, as both deal with the theft of government papers related to the navy. \\"Art in the Blood\\" (2014), the 23rd episode of Elementary, is inspired by the story. \\"The Adventure of the One Hundred Tadpoles\\", a 2015 episode of the NHK puppetry television series Sherlock Holmes, is based on the story. In the episode, Holmes and Watson try to take back a stolen picture which was entered in an art competition. The theme of the competition is tadpoles because \\"Tadpole\\" was the nickname of Sir Percy Phelps, founder of Beeton School. Radio \\"The Naval Treaty\\" was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. The episode aired on 19 January 1931.Dickerson (2019), p. 27. Another episode adapted from the story aired in August 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).Dickerson (2019), p. 75. Meiser also adapted the story as a 1940 episode of the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 96. The story was also adapted as an episode titled \\"The Case of the Stolen Naval Treaty\\" that aired in 1947 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Alfred Shirley as Watson).Dickerson (2019), p. 241. A radio dramatisation of \\"The Naval Treaty\\" aired on the BBC Home Service in 1952, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. The production was adapted by Felix Felton. Another dramatisation, which was also adapted by Felton and starred Hobbs and Shelley with a different supporting cast, aired in 1957 on the Home Service. A different radio version of \\"The Naval Treaty\\" adapted by Michael Hardwick aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1960, with Hobbs and Shelley again playing Holmes and Watson respectively. An adaptation of the story aired on BBC radio in 1978, starring Barry Foster as Holmes and David Buck as Watson. The story was adapted as an episode of CBS Radio Mystery Theater titled \\"The Naval Treaty\\". The episode, which featured Gordon Gould as Sherlock Holmes and Bernard Grant as Dr. Watson, first aired in April 1982. \\"The Naval Treaty\\" was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1992 by David Ashton as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Patrick Malahide as Percy Phelps, Brett Usher as Lord Holdhurst, Norman Jones as Mr Tangey, and Petra Markham as Miss Tangey. A 2014 episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, was adapted from the story, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

He designed the bytecoded virtual machine that made Smalltalk practical in 1976. He also invented bit blit, the general-purpose graphical operation that underlies most bitmap computer graphics systems today, and pop-up menus. He designed the generalizations of BitBlt to arbitrary color depth, with built-in scaling, rotation, and anti- aliasing. He made major contributions to the Squeak version of Smalltalk, including the original concept of a Smalltalk written in itself and made portable and efficient by a Smalltalk-to-C translator. Education Ingalls received his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in physics from Harvard University, and his Master of Science (M.S.) in electrical engineering from Stanford University. While working toward a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) at Stanford, he started a company to sell a software measurement invention that he perfected, and never returned to academia. Work Ingalls' first well known research was at Xerox PARC, where he began a lifelong research association with Alan Kay, and did his award-winning work on Smalltalk. He then moved to Apple Inc. He left research for a time to run the family business, the Homestead Resort, in Hot Springs, Virginia. He then worked at Interval Research Corporation, and then returned to Apple. Starting at Xerox, and then at Apple, he developed Fabrik, a visual programming language and integrated development environment (IDE), consisting of a kit of computing and user interface components that can be \\"wired\\" together to build new components and useful application software. Then he moved to Hewlett-Packard Labs, where he developed a module architecture for Squeak. He also started and still operates a small firm, Weather Dimensions, Inc., which displays local weather data on home computers. Ingalls then worked as a Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems, where he worked in the Sun Microsystems Laboratories (Sun Labs) research wing. His latest project is a JavaScript environment named Lively Kernel, which allows live, interactive Web programming and objects from inside Web browsers. While best known for his work on Smalltalk, Ingalls is also known for developing an optical character recognition system for Devanagari writing, which he did at the instigation of his father, Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr., a professor of Sanskrit. He lives near the beach in Rio del Mar, Aptos, California with his wife Cathleen Galas, where he contributes to development of the Squeak implementation of Smalltalk, JavaScript research, and the Lively Kernel Project, which now resides at the Hasso Plattner Institute. Ingalls has most recently moved to SAP SE Palo Alto Research Center, as a fellow. He is a key member of the Chief Scientist team guiding the company's technology vision, direction, and execution. Awards In 1984, Ingalls received the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Grace Murray Hopper Award for Outstanding Young Scientist, for his Xerox PARC research, including bit blit. In 1987, with Alan Kay, and Adele Goldberg, he received the ACM Software System Award, for his work on Smalltalk, the first fully object oriented programming software system.

History Naglee Park is home to numerous historic mansions and homes. The eastern part of Naglee Park has is characterized by mansions and large homes. Much of the Naglee Park neighborhood was developed on the grounds of the estate of Civil War Brigadier General Henry Morris Naglee. The Naglee estate\\"Naglee home\\" was famous for its gardens and vineyards. In 1902, nearly 20 years after General Naglee's death, the estate was subdivided to form the Naglee Park neighborhood. The Naglee Park Subdivision is bounded by E Santa Clara Street, E William Street, South 11th Street, and Coyote Creek. Many of the homes were constructed in the early 1900s, but few are built before 1906 because of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. These houses were built for many early Santa Clara Valley professionals and are historically significant. The Naglee Terrace Subdivision is bounded by East William Street, East Margaret Street, Coyote Creek (William Street Park), and South 11th Street. In 1958 a group of property owners were successful in changing the neighborhood zoning to allow multifamily development. Attempts had started in the 1940s with residents who were leaving the area and felt they could get better prices with less restrictive zoning. After San Jose State began to allow students to live off campus, in 1968, students moved into the area. About 70% of board and care facilities for mentally disabled people moved into the neighborhood, after changes to state policies, because of low prices in the late 1960s and early 1970s. . The neighborhood was zoned back into single-family homes in 1978 at the request of neighborhood residents.Jacobs, 23-24 In the 1950s through 1970s, the neighborhood was heavily impacted by growth of the University and downtown. Many of the larger homes were converted into apartments or board and care facilities. During the 1990s and 2000s, however, the neighborhood has experienced a revival, with many of the converted homes being fixed up and returned to single-family dwellings. Today, Naglee Park is one of the most livable neighborhoods in San Jose. The Campus Community Association (CCA) is the active neighborhood association in Naglee Park. The CCA sponsors neighborhood events such as Bark in the Park, the 4th of July parade and block party, and Christmas social. Geography The general boundaries of the neighborhood are Santa Clara Street, 11th Street, Interstate 280, and Coyote Creek. The local elementary is Horace Mann Elementary. The local middle school is Muwekma Ohlone Middle. The local high school is San Jose High School.

Published by EMAP and launched in May 1992 and placed at the \\"serious end\\" of the market, it catered to ST users who wished to use their ST for a variety of productive uses, such as its MIDI capabilities, programming or word processing, as opposed to casual gaming. The title was sold to Europress after EMAP decided to close it due to lower-than-expected sales and it ran for another two years with Freelance Editor Vic Lennard, full-time Deputy Editor, Tony Kaye and a full-time designer. This three-man team, along with several freelance contributors, kept the magazine popular for almost another two years before it finally succumbed to falling sales and the lack of success of Atari's Falcon, the expected replacement of the ST. This was due in part to the increasing PC market. The magazine was eventually sold to Future Publishing, producers of rival ST Format. The last issue was published in January 1995.Atari ST Review Like many similar magazines, it contained sections of news, game reviews, previews, tips, help guides, columnists, reader's letters, and cover-mounted disks of software.
