His father is Curtis Hudson, songwriter and producer, and most notably the co-writer of Madonna's song \\"Holiday\\", co-written with Eric's mother, singer/songwriter Lisa Stevens. Hudson attended Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey, and graduated in 2004. He is a multi-instrumentalist (including piano, drums, bass, guitar, and organ), and honed much of his early music development playing in church and conducting his own jazz band called the Jazz Funk Project. Hudson has played at Carnegie Hall, and performed at the Apollo Theater in Harlem for the 2002 Democratic National Convention. His early introduction into the industry began by working alongside legendary hip hop producers Buckwild and DJ Kay Gee from Naughty by Nature. Hudson was an instrumentalist on two ground-breaking albums, The Game's The Documentary and 50 Cent's The Massacre, which helped take his career to the next level. Soon after, he produced the song \\"Entourage\\" by Omarion.

Jackson and Kyle MacLachlan. It aired on HBO on March 26, 1994. The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Jackson and won a Primetime Emmy Award for Frankenheimer. Plot The docudrama is a partially fictionalized account of the four-day Attica Prison riot in 1971 at the Attica Correctional Facility, where prisoners took over much of state prison to protest inhumane conditions. The movie is focused on rookie Corrections Officer Michael Smith (Kyle MacLachlan) and inmate Jamaal X (Samuel L. Jackson) who develop a wary friendship with each other. It is largely told through Smith, who was shot four times, and based on Smith's testimony. Jamaal X is based on several inmates, including the inmate Smith credits with saving his life. Clarence Williams III plays the inmate Chaka, one of the more ruthless prisoners who does not participate in the riot for honorable reasons. The film opens with a montage of news footage from the late 1960s and early 1970s, including the assassination of Robert Kennedy, students killed at the Kent State shootings and the Watts riots. The movie then shows the quiet streets of Attica, New York and a 22 year old Smith in a barber shop getting his long hair cut. Smith is an expectant father who decided to become a corrections officer because of the pay. After the hair cut, he goes to start his new job at the prison where black militant Jamaal X also arrives. The film shows the first day of the two men, cross-cutting between them. The terrible prison conditions are revealed. Corrections Officers treat the prisoners abusively, with violence and needless strip searches, and basic needs like functioning toilets are ignored. The spirit of the Vietnam war protests is influencing the prisoners to seek recognition of their human rights. Smith begins hearing of complaints of degrading conditions from increasingly politicized prisoners, particularly Jamaal X, a Muslim leader prominent in the fight for prisoner rights. Smith is portrayed as the only officer who treats the inmates with respect and his occasional signs of sympathy for the prisoners make his co-workers suspicious of him. The seasoned Corrections Officers, like Lieutenant Weisbad, do not allow challenges to their methods of complete, and often humiliating, control. Ultimately Smith's alliance with Jamaal saves his life. Initially Smith allows himself to dehumanize the prisoners, cooperating with the inhumane treatment of the prisoners as he obeys the orders of his supervisors, even if it goes against his morals. His wife Sharon (Anne Heche) expresses disappointment and contempt when she tells him \\"You're changing!\\" However, Smith loses the willingness to follow orders during the uprising, after he is beaten by prisoners in the metal shop he supervises. Several prisoners led by the psychopath Chaka were able to overwhelm the officers and take them hostage when a gate malfunctions. Jamaal protects the officers from Chaka and the other sadists, recognizing they will lose the ability to negotiate with government officials if the hostages are killed. Smith refuses to humiliate himself in exchange for basic needs unlike the other captured officers. He tells his puzzled co-workers, \\"I wasn't a guard long enough to learn how to be a prisoner.\\" Jamaal comes to respect Smith for his non-conformity and considers him to be a kindred spirit. Jamaal recruits Smith to speak to a news crew, to testify that the hostages have not been tortured or killed. As the news conference, Smith hints to Jamaal that he cares more about his own dignity than the approval of others, an attitude he did not show prior to the crisis. However, New York's governor ends negotiations on the fifth day of the uprising and orders a raid by law enforcement officials and soldiers. Inmates and their hostages are fired at indiscriminately as their vision is impaired by tear gas. Chaka and Lt. Weisbad are among those killed. Smith is shot several times in the stomach by a friend who is an Attica police constable. Jamaal is wounded by a stray bullet. The statistics in film's epilogue convey its importance to the present. The U.S. prison population had risen 300 percent since the uprising, surpassing South Africa as the biggest per capita in the world, and this was likely to worsen with the three strikes law. Forty states were currently cited by the courts for overcrowding or other inhumane conditions. Cast * Kyle MacLachlan as Corrections Officer Michael Smith * Samuel L. Jackson as inmate Jamaal X * Clarence Williams III as inmate Chaka * Frederic Forrest as Vietnam veteran Corrections Officer Lieutenant Weisbad * Harry Dean Stanton as Hal Smith, Michael's father and a retired Correction Officer * Philip Bosco as Corrections Commissioner Russell Oswald * Tom Bower as Ed, Michael's uncle who works in the prison * Anne Heche as Sharon Smith, Michael's wife Production The film had a 31-day shooting schedule and $5.8 million budget. The film was filmed in Tennessee State Penitentiary near Nashville, Tennessee and in Clarksville, Tennessee in the spring of 1993. Michael Smith, who never worked in a prison again, was located with the help of private investigators. Former inmates who were present during the riot were cast as extras. MacLachlan spent hours talking to Smith to prepare for the role. Smith was originally invited to consult for a few days but stayed for the duration of the filming. Jackson drew on his own experience as an activist at Morehouse College in the 1960s, read books, and watched the TV series Eyes on the Prize to prepare for the role of Jamaal X. Williams prepared for the role of Chaka by watching documentary footage of the riot. Critical reception The film received almost unanimous acclaim from critics when it had its television premiere. Critics felt the film was compelling and praised the cast for its performance. The Chicago Tribune praised the \\"finely drawn characters\\" in Ron Hutchinson's script. Historical accuracy Although the prisoners were discontented with the ghastly prison conditions, the unplanned uprising began with a misunderstanding. On Sept. 8, 1971, a prisoner had been accused of hitting an officer. The next morning, after more prisoner infractions and a miscommunication among officers, a group of prisoners were locked in a tunnel connecting different parts of the prison. Believing that officers were coming to beat them up in reprisal, the prisoners attacked the officers in the tunnel and some attacked each other. Prisoners in other parts of the facility figured out what was happening and began to arm themselves e.g. with two-by-fours, chair legs, etc. When the prisoners in the tunnel burst out, the other inmates were taking over the prison. They created a society, with some rules by consensus and elected leaders. Observers like radical defense lawyer William M. Kunstler, The New York Times columnist Tom Wicker, and Bobby Seale, chairman of the Black Panther Party, were invited to inspect prison conditions and monitor negotiations. The observers took on the role of mediators. relaying demands which included amnesty from reprisals and basic rights. The prison uprising ended on September 13, 1971, when 1,000 New York state troopers, sheriff's deputies, correction officers and members of the National Guard under the order of Governor Nelson Rockefeller to fire at will, raided the prison and killed 29 inmates and 10 officers who were being held hostage. Rockefeller, who wanted to be president, had decided not to go to the prison to broker a peaceful resolution as the inmates and their negotiators had asked. Although agreement appeared near on many of the inmates‚Äô demands, the assault was approved when negotiations over amnesty had stalled and there were concerns for the safety of the hostages. Some prisoners beat up their least favorite officers. One officer, William Quinn, died early in the uprising after a blow to the head; he fell and was trampled. After that, officers taken hostage were treated well. After a helicopter sprayed a cloud of tear gas, troopers shot indiscriminately some 2,000 rounds of ammunition. After the shooting stopped, scores of prisoners were beaten and tortured, hundreds of whom were seriously wounded and initially denied medical care. Who shot Michael Smith has not been revealed. The brutalization of inmates continued long after the re-taking of the prison.

According to the theory, there are no events contrary to nature ‚Äî that is no \\"transgressions\\", in Hume's sense, of the laws of nature. An event is a miracle only in the sense that it does not agree with our understanding of nature, or fit our picture of nature, or that it thwarts our expectations as to how the world should behave. According to a perfect scientific understanding there would be no miracles at all. The name of the theory is derived from the Ancient Greek word , episteme, meaning \\"well- founded knowledge\\".  Augustine's account  Jesus exploiting surface tension In The City of God, Book XXI, Chapter 8, Augustine quotes Marcus Varro, Of the Race of the Roman People: :There occurred a remarkable celestial portent; for Castor records that, in the brilliant star Venus, called Vesperugo by Plautus, and the lovely Hesperus by Homer, there occurred so strange a prodigy, that it changed its colour, size, form, course, which never appeared before nor since. Adrastus of Cyzicus, and Dion of Naples, famous mathematicians, said that this occurred in the reign of Ogyges. : So great an author as Varro would certainly not have called this a portent had it not seemed to be contrary to nature. For we say that all portents are contrary to nature; but they are not so. For how is that contrary to nature which happens by the will of God, since the will of so mighty a Creator is certainly the nature of each created thing? A portent, therefore, happens not contrary to nature, but contrary to what we know as nature.Modern Library, p. 776, tr. Dods, emphasis added Augustine argues that there can be no true transgression of the laws of nature, because everything that happens according to God's will happens by nature, and a transgression of the laws of nature would therefore happen contrary to God's will. A miracle therefore is not contrary to nature as it really is, but only contrary to nature as our current understanding supposes it to be (Portentum ergo fit non contra naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura). For example, if we were to see a man walking on water, and the man really were walking on water, that would not be possible given the laws of nature as we understand them. (The surface tension of water is not great enough to support a man's weight.) But it is logically possible that our understanding of the laws of nature is incomplete, and that under certain circumstances it is possible for a man to walk on water.  Spinoza's account  Baruch Spinoza In Chapter Six of Spinoza's Theologico-Political Treatise (\\"Of Miracles\\"), Spinoza claims that the universal laws of nature are decrees of God. Hence, any event happening in nature which contravened nature's universal laws, would necessarily also contravene the Divine decree, nature, and understanding; or if anyone asserted that God acted in contravention to the laws of nature, he, ipso facto, would be compelled to assert that God acted against His own nature‚Äîan evident absurdity.Tractatus p. 83 : Further, as nothing happens in nature which does not follow from her laws, and as her laws embrace everything conceived by the Divine intellect, and lastly, as nature preserves a fixed and immutable order; it most clearly follows that miracles are only intelligible as in relation to human opinions, and merely mean events of which the natural cause cannot be explained by a reference to any ordinary occurrence, either by us, or at any rate, by the writer and narrator of the miracle.Tractatus p. 84, emphasis added In other words, according to Spinoza, miracles are not a transgression of natural or scientific laws, but only of natural laws as we currently understand them. A \\"miracle\\" is simply an event we cannot explain, and is parasitic upon our ignorance. It is, in reality, a natural event that surpasses our limited human comprehension. To a perfect understanding nothing would appear miraculous. This is the first main point that Spinoza makes in his chapter \\"Of Miracles.\\" His second point is that neither God's nature, nor his existence can be known from miracles; they can be known only from the fixed and immutable order of nature. If we understand miracles as actual interruptions or contraventions of the order of nature, and so of the will of God, then not only are they impossible, but they can provide no basis for knowledge of God. However, if understanding miracles epistemically, i.e. as events the causes of which we do not understand, then we have no basis for knowledge of God in this case either. We cannot base knowledge of God on ignorance, and events are miraculous only due to our ignorance of their natural causes. :If, therefore, anything should come to pass in nature which does not follow from her laws, it would also be in contravention to the order which God has established in nature for ever through universal natural laws; it would, therefore, be in contravention to God's nature and laws, and, consequently, belief in it would throw doubt upon everything, and lead to Atheism.  John Polkinghorne  The miracle of boiling The view of particle physicist and theologian John Polkinghorne is somewhat similar. Polkinghorne argues that an apparently simple event like boiling water, where a small quantity of liquid changes into a large quantity of steam (a phase transition) would seem miraculous to someone who had not seen it every day. :I try to understand God's action that we call miraculous in the same sort of way. There is an underlying consistency of God's relationship to the world but the existence of a new regime may mean that consistency expresses itself in totally unprecedented, totally unexpected consequences.Polkinghorne 1990 Polkinghorne argues that God cannot control things on the macroscopic scale by acting microscopically on each elementary particle in the universe, but that He can act within the framework of chaos theory as \\"pure spirit\\". As the complex nonlinear systems of life oscillate back and forth trying to decide which strange attractor to move towards, God intervenes gently in the direction that moves the system where he wishes it to go.Polkinghorne 1998 ch. 3 See Quantum mysticism.  McLean v. Arkansas  Evolution on trial The epistemic conception of the miraculous does not agree with the definition given in the famous McLean v. Arkansas case. In this case (McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education, 529 F. Supp. 1255, 1258‚Äì1264) (ED Ark. 1982), brought in Arkansas, the judge, William Overton, gave a clear, specific definition of science as a basis for ruling that 'creation science' is religion and not science. His judgment defined the essential characteristics of science as being :#guided by natural law; :#explanatory by reference to natural law; :#empirically testable; :#tentative in conclusion, i.e. not necessarily the final word; :#falsifiable. However, an epistemic explanation of miraculous events would satisfy at least the first two definitions.  Islamic view of miracles  The epistemic conception of the miraculous does not agree with the definition given in the work of the Muslim scholar al-ƒ™dÃ≤jÃ≤ƒ´ MawƒÅ·∏≥if, historian A.J. Wensinck, who saysA.J. Wensinck, Mu ødÃ≤jÃ≤iza, Encyclopedia of Islam that the main purpose of miracle is to prove the sincerity of the apostle and has to satisfy the following conditions: # It must be performed by God # \\"It must be contrary to the usual course of things\\" # It should be impossible to contradict it # \\"It must happen at the hands of him who claims to be an apostle\\" # \\"It must be in conformity with his announcement of it, and the miracle itself must not be a disavowal of his claim\\" # \\"It must follow on his claim\\" This contrasts with the epistemic theory, where a miracle is not contrary to the usual course of things (although it may be contrary to our current understanding).

History  The site launched in 2000 as FaxYourMP, allowing users to type a message into the website which would then be sent as a fax to their representative's office. In 2005, it rebranded as WriteToThem, sending messages by email or as faxes to those representatives who did not yet operate an email account.  Controversies  mySociety publish an annual table to show which MPs are the most and least responsive; this is based on the results of a rolling survey which is sent to users two weeks after they use the site.

Jacobs is particularly well known in the field of ufology for his research and authoring of books on the subject of alleged alien abductions. Career Jacobs obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1973, in the field of intellectual history. He wrote his dissertation on the controversy over unidentified flying objects in America. A revised edition of his dissertation was published as The UFO Controversy in America by Indiana University Press in 1975, and sold out (very unusual for an academic work).Jacobs 1975 As a faculty member of the Department of History at Temple University, Jacobs specialized in history of 20th-century American popular culture. He stated that his current research interests \\"involve a delineation of the role of anomalous experiences in personal and cultural life.\\" For over 25 years Jacobs taught a course on \\"UFOs in American Society.\\" AMER ST 2063: UFOs in American Society. (Formerly: AMER ST 0116.) Ufology Jacobs has a high profile in the field of Ufology. He has lectured widely, been interviewed, and participated in numerous television and radio shows on the subject of alien abductions. April 12, 2005, interview; June 2003 interview: Part 1, Part 2. David Jacobs has written five books on the topic of UFOs and alleged alien abductions. In recent years Jacobs has argued publicly that the evidence from his research, which sometimes includes utilizing hypnotic regression with alleged alien abductees along with traditional interview techniques, purports that alien-human hybrids were engaged in a covert program of infiltration into human society with possibly the final goal of taking over Earth. He asserts that some of his research subjects are teaching these hybrids how to blend into human society so that they cannot be differentiated from humans, and that this is occurring worldwide. Criticism Jacobs' hypotheses have been criticized as unsupportably dire by those who take a more positive view of the alien abduction experience such as John E. Mack; Jacobs labels these critics as \\"positivists\\" in his writings. Details of alien abductions reported by Jacobs and so-called \\"positivist\\" researchers may not differ to any great extent; criticism of Jacobs by such peers therefore focuses on Jacobs' interpretations, e.g., where Jacobs sees \\"infiltration\\" (a negative), others may see \\"integration\\" (a positive). Where differences in reports are more substantial (extending beyond the interpretive to actual distinctions between the alleged events reported by those who Jacobs interviews versus those interviewed by others), Jacobs has explained that elements not matching his own perspective are what he terms \\"confabulations.\\" Addendum 1: Abductions. Carl Sagan and Susan Clancy have criticized the methods used by Jacobs and other abduction researchers. Sagan asserted that sightings and experiences could be attributed to mistaken identity and faulty memory. Clancy has highlighted problems associated with abduction research, such as faulty memory retrieval when hypnotists \\"lead\\" the patient, and sleep paralysis. Jacobs has argued that Clancy's methodology was flawed, stating that in numerous cases people report they were abducted when fully awake and conscious, and that therefore sleep paralysis is not a tenable hypothesis. Moreover, he has stated that her book was factually incorrect.

The two used to take tobacco and Omani dry lime to sell in Kuwait and Bahrain and returned with goods like fabric and watches ‚Äî from Switzerland and France ‚Äî to sell in Dubai. The business expanded to Pakistan, India and across the Arab world into Europe, as it began to attract the support of international brands planning to enter the then Trucial States. It was around that time that Al Majid formally launched his own companies, Mohammad & Juma Al Majid alongside Al Gaz's United Arab Agencies. At the beginning of the fifties, he participated with his colleagues: Mr. Humaid Al Tayer, Abdullah Al Ghurair, Nasir Rashed Loutah, and with consent of Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum in the establishment of the first charitable society to help the needy of Dubai, so they established two secondary schools, one for boys in Bur Dubai, called Jamal Abdul Nasser Secondary School, the second for girls in Bur Deira, called Amna Secondary Schools. The partnership between Al Majid and Al Qaz lasted 11 years. After the UAE Federation was formed, Al Majid left the gold business as the trade and development projects the country offered greater opportunities. In 1974, Al Gaz and Al Majid began work on establishing a Pepsi factory in Dubai, the National Cement Company, and the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He also diversified into the carpentry and d√©cor business. The group has since diversified further into transport and logistics, construction, food and advertising. There is also an international investment company, Al Majid Investment. Majid established the Islamic and Arabic Studies College in 1987 in Dubai. In 1990, Al Majid, along with Al Gaz and other local philanthropists, established the Beit Al Khair Society, a charitable organization aims to aid the poor citizens, needy students, as well as offering cash or commodities to the victims of disasters. In 1991, Al Majid realized the needs of scholars and researchers, especially those who are unable to obtain the necessary books, references and manuscripts, so he established a public library, afterwards it was developed to become a cultural organization, known as Juma Al Majid Center for Culture and Heritage. Over time, Al Majid went on to secure franchise rights for other international brands ‚Äî in engineering, automobiles, office furniture, communication and tyres ‚Äî from companies like Samsung, Hyundai, Hitachi and many more. He is succeeded by his heir Khalid Juma Al Majid.

The municipality was formed by the merger of rural communities Berunes, Buland, and Geithellur on October 1, 1992. The coastline consists of three fjords Berufj√∂r√∞ur, Hamarsfj√∂r√∞ur, and √Ålftafj√∂r√∞ur. The town of Dj√∫pivogur is located on a peninsula between Berufj√∂r√∞ur and Hamarsfj√∂r√∞ur. Approximately 900 m west of the town is a work of art named \\"Eggin √≠ Gle√∞iv√≠k\\" (The Eggs of Merry Bay) by Sigur√∞ur Gu√∞mundsson. The work is a replica of the eggs of 34 nesting birds in the area, and was installed in the summer of 2009. Eggin √≠ Gle√∞iv√≠k (Eggs at Merry Bay) sculpture Dj√∫pivogur is home to Langab√∫√∞, one of Iceland's oldest commercial buildings. The south end dates back to 1790, but the building only took on its present appearance when the northern part was constructed in 1850. Langab√∫√∞ served many purposes, being a warehouse and slaughterhouse. Today, it is home to a caf√©, the heritage museum and an exhibition on the Icelandic sculptor R√≠kar√∞ur J√≥nsson, who was native to the village. Langab√∫√∞  Climate  Dj√∫pivogur features a cold tundra climate (K√∂ppen: ET). Approximately 5 kilometres west of Dj√∫pivogur lies Teigarhorn, a farm on the shores of Berufj√∂r√∞ur, where weather observations has been commenced since 1874. It is one of the oldest weather stations in the country and holds the record for the highest temperature ever recorded in Iceland, recorded on June 22, 1939. It is also claimed that Teigarhorn reached in September 1940, but that is not recognized by the Icelandic Meteorological Office. Temperatures above are very rare in Iceland, it has occurred only 5 times since weather observations were first commenced in Iceland in the 19th century. Teigarhorn features a cold tundra climate (K√∂ppen: ET) because it doesn't have any month that has a mean temperature above , but the winter temperatures are mild for a cold tundra climate, and thus closely resembles a mild tundra climate or a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc), the climate generally seen in coastal Iceland.  History  By the early nineteenth century, Dj√∫pivogur was 'a tiny port with a Danish colonial trading base'. Hans Jonatan, who had been a slave in Copenhagen, escaped there and became one of Iceland's first people of colour.Krist√≠n Loftsd√≥ttir and G√≠sli P√°lsson, 'Black on White: Danish Colonialism, Iceland and the Caribbean', in Scandinavian Colonialism and the Rise of Modernity: Small Time Agents in a Global Arena, ed. by Magdalena Naum and Jonas M. Nordin, Contributions To Global Historical Archaeology Volume, 37 (New York: Springer, 2013), pp. 37--52 (quoting p. 47).  Culture  Dj√∫pivogur is the first and only Cittaslow town in Iceland. Cittaslow's goals include improving the quality of life in towns by slowing down its overall pace, especially in a city's use of spaces and the flow of life and traffic through them. Cittaslow is part of a cultural trend known as the slow movement.  See also  * √Ü√∞arstein Lighthouse  References   External links  * Djupivogur * Dj√∫pivogur.

The decree describes the following: \\"Erepenning voor blijken van belangstelling in 's Rijksverzamelingen door schenking betoond\\" (). The medal is awarded in gold, silver or bronze as a token of appreciation to those who \\"aan hen, die enig boek- of kunstwerk, dat de vrucht van hun arbeid was, de Koning deden toekomen\\" (). By royal decree, on 5 May 1877, eligibility for this award was extended by King William III of the Netherlands, with the description \\"aan hen, die door het aanbieden van belangrijke geschenken of op andere wijze zich verdienstelijk hebben gemaakt ten opzichte van de verschillende wetenschappelijke en kunstverzamelingen des Rijks\\" (). Due to this description, the medal obtained its current official name. However, since the end of the 19th century, this decoration is primarily known as the \\"Museum Medal\\". Up until 1897, the honorary medal was only a standing decoration, when Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands declared that the medal could be worn suspended from a ribbon. Eligibility for this award was once again extending, by Queen Wilhelmina, on 28 October 1919 with the description \\"verdiensten jegens gemeentelijke (openbare) verzamelingen\\" (English: merit towards community (public) collections). What was initially a medal for generous donors became now an official royal award for merit. Queen Juliana of the Netherlands decided by royal decree on 26 July 1952 that the shape of the medal and ribbon should be changed. The current ribbon is orange with two red lines descending down the middle. A ribbon bar is also given with the award, with a palm branch device in either gold or silver for recipients of the gold or silver versions of the medal, respectively. Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands later changed the composition of the medallion, and is now depicted on the obverse of the medal.

The Hunterian Psalter (or York Psalter) is an illuminated manuscript of the 12th century. It was produced in England some time around 1170, and is considered a striking example of Romanesque book art. The work is part of the collection of the Glasgow University Library, cataloged as Sp Coll MS Hunter U.3.2 (229), which acquired the book in 1807. It derives its colloquial name, the \\"Hunterian Psalter\\", from having been part of the collection of 18th century Scottish anatomist and book collector William Hunter, who willed his collection to the University. It has also at times been known as the \\"York Psalter\\", owing to its supposed northern English origin in the city of York.Glasgow University Library, special exhibition Text The original text of the Hunterian Psalter, all written in the same hand, consists of the 150 psalms from Jerome's Versio Gallicana revision of the Vulgate Bible, Biblical canticles and liturgical texts, and numerous illustrations, over more than two hundred pages of heavy vellum. One leaf is missing, probably removed for its illuminated initial. The final thirteen folios contain later additions to the text, prayers likely from the late 13th century. These prayers were written for a female reader, but the singular feminine Latin endings were first overwritten with singular masculine endings, and then still later, plural masculine ones. There is also a formula for an amulet intended to cure epilepsy dating from the same century. Illustrations Eve spinning, showing the incised gold leaf background; the patterns are different on each page The book opens with an illustrated calendar, each month beginning with the historiated letters \\"KL\\", an abbreviation for kalenda, i.e. the first day of the month. Then follow thirteen pages of prefatory full-page miniatures, two scenes to a page, with three pages of Old Testament scenes, six of scenes from the Life of Christ (further pages are perhaps missing), and, unusually for this date, three from the Life of the Virgin, including a Death of the Virgin, with a funeral procession, and an Assumption. These are the earliest English miniatures to have gold leaf backgrounds incised with patterns of lines and dots. After these pages there is an opening with full-page miniatures of David playing his harp and a Beatus initial for the start of Psalm 1 (\\"Beatus vir\\"). All the psalms have a large illuminated initial, often historiated, and each verse starts with an enlarged gold initial. The start of the ten traditional divisions of the text have especially large initials, as is usually the case.Glasgow University Library accessed 30 August 2008 Many of the illustrations and historiated initials seem to have been truncated at the top, perhaps the result of the book having been poorly re-bound at some time. Another theory is that the tops of the pages simply bear holes from where cloth curtains were once stitched. The book was re-bound again in 1983. The manuscript's illustrations are notable for their several departures from scripture, for example in the panel depicting the sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham, Isaac's hands are depicted as unbound. In Genesis 22:9, it is written, \\"...He bound his son Isaac, and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.\\" Provenance It is uncertain where or when, exactly, the manuscript was produced, or for whom. It has been suggested that it was produced for Roger de Mowbray (d. 1188), a prominent 12th century crusader and religious benefactor known to have founded a number of Augustinian and Cistercian monasteries and nunneries. The book also contains three commemorations to Augustine of Hippo, which has led some scholars to conclude that the manuscript might have been created for a house of Augustinian Canons, or by someone with a connection to the Augustinian order. The fact that there is no mention of the 29 December feast of Thomas Becket on the page for December is thought to indicate that the book was produced before Becket's canonization in 1173. For most of its history, it was thought to have been the product of a scriptorium in the north of England, owing to its inclusion of a number of northern saints such as Oswald of Northumbria and John of Beverley (who very seldom occur outside northern manuscripts), although modern scholarly consensus puts its likely origin in the southwest of England. There is no definite consensus about the number of artists who worked on the book. It has been suggested that a single master oversaw the work of several assistants, and it has also been put forth that it is the work of an artist working alone, copying and adapting templates from other illuminated manuscripts. It is thought to have been the work of skilled tradesmen, not monks.

Shea was an all round athlete, and was an accomplished swimmer and professional boxer. He is best known as being the first rugby union player to achieve the Full House of scoring in an international match. Rugby union career Born in Newport in 1892, Shea initially played rugby union with Pill Harriers, a notoriously tough team from Newport Docks. It was with Pill that Shea gained his first cap for Wales, against the post-war touring New Zealand Army. in 1919, like many Pill players, he switched to Newport RFC, the Harriers first-class rivals. The next year he was selected to play for Wales against England at St. Helens in the Five Nations Championship. Unsurprisingly for teams meeting for the first time since the end of the First World War, both teams contained many new caps. It was in this match that Shea would make history by scoring a try, conversion, drop goal, and penalty goal, the first player to do so at an international level.Griffiths (1988), pg 74. In a rain swept match, Shea opened the scoring in the first half with a penalty goal against the wind. England responded with a try and conversion, both from Harold Day, to take the first half 5‚Äì3. Within five minutes of the restart, Shea had drop kicked Wales back into the lead. With twenty minutes remaining, and the Welsh forwards in command, Shea broke through the English defence to score a try under the posts which he easily converted. Wick Powell then scored a second try for Wales, before Shea finished the match with another drop goal, for a convincing Welsh win.Griffiths (1988), pg 75. The feat of achieving all four rugby union scores was held by Shea alone until Lewis Jones emulated him thirty years later when on tour with the British Lions against Australia. Shea would play two more matches for Wales, both on the losing side. Shea found himself at the centre of a controversy before the start of the 1920 game against Scotland, when the Scottish Rugby Union threatened to pull out of the game against Wales as Shea was a professional boxer.Smith (1980), pg 208. A negative response from national newspapers towards the Scottish complaints ensured that the game went ahead. After the game, in which Scotland won 9‚Äì5; Shea was criticised in some sections of the press, for attempting to play the match against Scotland single-handed.Smith (1980), pg 205. Shea's final game was played against England on 15 January 1921. Whether or not Shea would have achieved more caps for Wales is unknown as in 1921 he turned professional by joining rugby league side Wigan in December of that year for a then record fee of ¬£700.Smith (1980), pg 209. International matches played WalesSmith (1980), pg 471. * 1920, 1921 * New Zealand Army XV 1919 * 1920 Rugby league career Shea's first game for Wigan was on Christmas Eve, 1921, scoring a try on his d√©but. He remained with the club for three seasons, two of them as captain, though he never moved to Wigan and always travelled to matches from Wales. On 11 December 1922 he became a dual-code international when he turned out for the Wales national rugby league team in an away match against England. He played his second and final league international match the next year, when Wales beat England 13‚Äì2 in an encounter at Wigan. After leaving Wigan, Shea was instrumental in setting up Pontypridd RLFC, a lone professional league team in Wales that competed in the Northern League, though the club failed to find support and folded the following season. Jerry Shea played left-, i.e. number 4, in Wigan's 13-2 victory over Oldham in the Championship Final during the 1921‚Äì22 season at The Cliff, Broughton on Saturday 6 May 1922. Jerry Shea played right-, i.e. number 3, in Wigan's 20‚Äì2 victory over Leigh in the 1922‚Äì23 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1922‚Äì23 season at The Willows, Salford on Saturday 25 November 1922. Boxing career As well as a rugby player Shea was also a professional boxer, fighting in the welter and middleweight categories. Shea's first professional bout was on 18 January 1916 against Twiggy Davies at The Park Hall, in Newport. He drew the match but just two weeks later he beat Davies by points decision at the same venue. Although Shea never fought for a major belt, he faced and beat several notable fighters during his nine-year professional career. He twice faced Frank Moody, the British and Commonwealth champion, drawing on points in their first encounter in 1919, and then beating him by points in their rematch at the Empire Theatre in Cardiff the following year. Just two weeks after defeating Moody, Shea was lined up against Ted \\"Kid\\" Lewis at the Pavilion in Mountain Ash. Lewis, the former World Welterweight champion, won by a knockout in the first round. In 1920, Shea beat future European Welterweight Champion, Rene DeVos at The Ring in Blackfriars, then in 1922 he defeated the future British light-heavyweight champion Gipsy Daniels at Newport. His final recorded fight was on 17 November 1924 when he faced ex-welterweight champ, Johnny Basham. Shea won the contest on points.

The house is notable as a rare example in Ireland of a 16th-century unfortified house. It is situated close to the Collegiate Church of St Mary Youghal. History Walter Raleigh, former resident of Myrtle Grove It was home for Sir Walter Raleigh from 1588 to 1589. Myrtle Grove's South Gable is where Edmund Spenser is reputed to have written part of his poem The Faerie Queene, although some historians question this story. The house was acquired by Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork in 1602 from Sir Walter Raleigh's Irish estate. Though remodelled twice it remains one of the best-known examples of a Tudor house in Ireland. The house was acquired by Hayman family in the 18th century. In the 20th century, it was the home of Sir Henry Arthur Blake and Lady Blake. At this time, the building housed \\"the best collection of West Indian paintings and sketches\\". The Blakes lived here until their deaths. They were buried in the garden. The house remains in private ownership but is open to the public on certain days of the year. Legends The house is reputed to be where potatoes were first planted in Ireland or in Europe. The latter is unlikely however, as potatoes were present only in Spain in 1536. There is a similar legend stating that Myrtle Grove was where tobacco was first smoked by Walter Raleigh. A servant was said to have observed Raleigh from behind and seen smoke rising from him. Thinking that Raleigh was on fire he threw a bucket of water on him to douse the fire. This legend is also however associated with several of Raleigh's other houses. \\"Myrtle Grove\\", a poem written in Spenserian stanzas by James Reiss, and published in Fugue magazine (the University of Idaho) in 2007, develops the legend that Edmund Spenser wrote portions of his great epic, The Faerie Queene, under an aureole window in the South Gable of Raleigh's house.

Previous MP  The seat had become vacant when the constituency's Liberal Member of Parliament, the Rt Hon. Sir Francis Dyke Acland, Bt. died. Acland was first elected for this seat in the 1932 North Cornwall by-election and retained it until his death.  Previous Result  * Note on 1935 result: Change and swing are calculated from the result of the by-election on 22 July 1932.  Candidates  The Liberal Party candidate was Tom Horabin (1896 ‚Äì 26 April 1956). He was a business consultant with no local ties and no track record as an election candidate. He was a close friend of John Foot, the influential Liberal candidate for neighbouring Bodmin. The Conservative candidate was E.R. Whitehouse. He had previously contested the seat at the 1935 United Kingdom general election. The local Labour party had already selected D.C.N. Wakley to contest the forthcoming General Election. However, Labour party Headquarters successfully put pressure on the local Labour party to withdraw their candidate. The action of the Labour HQ was a clear indication of a desire to electorally co-operate with the Liberal party at a forthcoming General Election, along the lines of a Popular Front.  Result  The by-election took place shortly before the start of the Second World War. It was the last peacetime by-election won by the Liberal Party until the 1958 Torrington by-election.  Aftermath  Tom Horabin was the Liberal Party Chief Whip from August 1945 until he resigned and left the party in October 1946. He continued to represent North Cornwall until the 1950 general election, first as an Independent and then as a Labour MP from November 1947. In 1950 Horabin contested Exeter, but did not return to the House of Commons.

It was first published in the Civil and Military Gazette on 29 November 1886; its first appearance in book form was in the first Indian edition of Plain Tales from the Hills in 1888, and it later appeared in subsequent editions of that collection. The tale is an interesting example of Kipling's attitudes to different races and cultures, which is less simple than many accounts of his beliefs allow.  Authorship  Rudyard's sister Alice \\"Trix\\" Kipling may have been involved in the writing of some of the stories in Plain Tales from the Hills, including \\"Lispeth\\": \\"As is widely acknowledged by Kipling scholars, Alice was a prime contributor to previous Kipling collection, among them Echoes (1884) and Quartette (1885)...In \\"Trix‚ÄîThe Other Kipling\\" (Kipling Journal, September 2014), Barbara Fisher...speculates that signs of Trix‚Äôs sensibility can be found in 'Lispeth', 'Three‚Äì and an Extra', 'Miss Youghal‚Äôs Sais', 'Bitters Neat', 'Yoked to an Unbeliever', 'False Dawn' and 'Cupid‚Äôs Arrow[sic]\\" (48). In all of these stories, Fisher locates central narrative strands concerning unrequited love, unhappy marriages, star-crossed lovers, and unhappy maidens‚Äîthemes, as noted above, that concerned the eighteen-year old Alice more as they concerned Rudyard less.\\" An anonymous article published in The Youth's Companion in 1924 also hints at this: ‚ÄúRudyard Kipling was so seldom in Simla that I have always felt convinced that his sister helped him a great deal in the ground work of his tales and ditties; she had a more intimate knowledge than he of Simla and its society.\\"\\"When the Plain Tales First Reached the Hills.\\" The Youth's Companion [Boston, Massachusetts], vol. 98, 7 Aug. 1924, pp. 531-32. ProQuest Historical Newspapers.  Plot summary  The story is set in Kotgarh, a valley about by road from Simla, the \\"summer seat of the British Government of India\\". It is the home of Sonoo and his wife Jadeh, who, after the maize fails and bears raid their opium poppy field, turn Christian. Their daughter is Elizabeth, or 'Lispeth' in \\"the Hill or Pahari pronunciation.\\" Cholera kills Sonoo and Jadeh, and Lispeth becomes servant/companion to the Chaplain's wife at Kotgarh. She grows very lovely, \\"a stately goddess, five feet ten in her shoes.\\" One day on her walk ( \\"little constitutionals...between Kotgarth and Narkunda\\" consisting between says Kipling, with fine irony and huge admiration of the hill people) she finds an unconscious Englishman whom she carries back to the Mission, announcing that she has found her husband. This scandalises the Chaplain and his wife, and they \\"lectured her severely on the impropriety of her conduct.\\" The stranger, a traveler hunting plants and butterflies, recovers. He enjoys flirting with Lispeth, although he is engaged to an English \\"girl at Home.\\" When he decides to leave Kotgarh to return to England, the Chaplain's wife advises the Englishman to tell Lispeth that he will marry her. Of course, the Englishman does not return, and after three months of Lispeth's waiting and weeping, the Chaplain's wife tells her the truth, saying \\"it was 'wrong and improper' of Lispeth to think of marriage with an Englishman, who was of a superior clay...\\" Upon learning that she has been deceived by the Englishman and the Chaplain's wife, Lispeth returns to live among her own people, marrying a wood-cutter \\"who beat her after the manner of paharis.\\" In response to Lispeth's rejection of Christianity the Chaplain's wife concludes: \\"'There is no law whereby you can account for the vagaries of the heathen...and I believe that Lispeth was always at heart an infidel.‚Äù At this point in the story the 'native' is shown as honest, simple and admirable, and it is the Christians who are the hypocrites and liars. It is not quite as simple as that: Kipling also suggests that he has heard this story from Lispeth herself, who \\"when she was sufficiently drunk, could sometimes be induced to tell the story of her first love-affair\\" - which may seem a rather patronising European attitude to 'the natives.'  The Woman of Shamlegh in Kim  thumb \\"The Woman of Shamlegh,\\" John Lockwood Kipling, 1901. An anonymous review of Kim published in the Yale Literary Magazine in 1901 suggested that the character of the Woman of Shamlegh in Kipling's novel might be Lispeth: \\"The Hill woman who helps Kim and the Holy man may be none other than Lispeth, whom we knew in 'Plain Tales from the Hills.' For she too, when a girl at the mission house, had nursed back to health a 'Sahib' who said he would return and wed her, but never did return. So she had gone back to her people. But, though lost to the 'Ker-lis-te-ans,' if she is indeed Lispeth, still in 'Kim' by service does she 'acquire merit beyond all others.'\\" Information on the Kipling Society's website gives a similar interpretation: \\"She next appears in Kim as the 'Woman of Shamlegh', and makes unsuccessful overtures to him although he does give her a kiss on the cheek. This is an interesting link between Kipling‚Äôs first book on India and his last and somewhat of a contradiction in the fate of Lispeth in this story and her more successful life in Kim, where Lockwood Kipling‚Äôs illustration shows her as a well-built and obviously prosperous woman.\\" In Narratives of Empire: The Fictions of Rudyard Kipling Zohreh T. Sullivan argues: \\"Sexually exploited and abandoned, [Lispeth] suggests the larger betrayal of the Indians by their colonizers (McClure 1981 : 75-6). Kim will refuse her sexual invitation, not only to show his moral superiority over callous Sahibs, but also to prove that he has passed a crucial test of colonial manhood‚Äìthe denial of sexuality.\\"  Critical response  In 1890 The Atlanta Constitution published \\"Lispeth\\" in their newspaper and wrote that it \\"has a good deal of the cynicism with which Mr. Kipling is credited.\\"\\"With the Magazinists.\\" The Atlanta Constitution (1881-1945), May 04, 1890, pp. 7, ProQuest, https://search.proquest.com/docview/194119272 An anonymous review of Plain Tales for the Hills published in The Derby Mercury in 1899 made mention of \\"Lispeth\\": \\"the author illustrates one of the difficulties of missionary work.\\" An anonymous letter entitled \\"Mr. Kipling's Theology,\\" published in The Outlook in 1900 argued that: \\"both Lispeth and Ameera [another Kipling character] exemplify true feminine devotion, and none the less perfectly because they are heathen.\\"R, B.

Bhupal Singh argues that \\"the same cynical attitude of Kipling towards missionaries is illustrated in the return of the heart-broken Lispeth to her ancestral gods. The satire, however, spoils this story, which is essentially tragic.\\"Singh, Bhupal. \\"Rudyard Kipling: A Survey of His Indian Stories.\\" Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism, edited by Sharon K.

Originally published in A Survey of Anglo-Indian Fiction, by Bhupal Singh, Oxford University Press, 1934. Harold Bloom argues that \\"while the denser of [Kipling's] contemporary English readers might have overlooked the irony and simply interpreted [Lispeth] as either an affirmation of their beliefs on miscegenation and the \\"White Man's Burden\\" or a quaint tragedy about true love lost, perceptive readers were forced to ask themselves just what good the missionaries brought to this girl's life and whether the same holds true for the imperialist enterprise as a whole.\\" Shahin Kuli Khan Khattak praises the story for its message, while acknowledging the inaccuracy of Kipling's depiction of Lispeth's behavior with the Englishman: ‚ÄúThe moral of the tale is laudable, notwithstanding the fact that Indian girls of all religions are very demure in their attitude to marriage, and would seldom have behaved as depicted.\\" Dane Kennedy argues that \\"Kipling panders in this story to the British Indian community's widespread distrust of missionaries, who were accused of fostering expectations of equality on the part of indigenous peoples that were bound to cause disappointment and discontent. At the same time, however, he offers a far more sweeping commentary on the relationship between the British and the inhabitants of the hills. Lispeth serves as the symbol of a paradisiacal people who are too simple, too gentle, too fragile to survive the encounter with the West.\\" References Short stories by Rudyard Kipling Rudyard Kipling stories about India 1886 short stories Works originally published in the Civil and Military Gazette ","title":"Lispeth"},{"id":"19102944","text":"This is a select list of Cornish dialect words in English‚Äîwhile some of these terms are obsolete others remain in use.Phillipps, K.

He was among the small number of high-ranking Confederates to have been born in the North. He served on the Atlantic Coast early in the war, commanding a brigade in Virginia before being reassigned to administrative duty due to his age and health. He then led troops during the Carolinas Campaign in 1865. Early life and career Blanchard was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts. He accepted an appointment to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, and graduated 26th in the Class of 1829. Among his classmates was Robert E. Lee. Initially given the rank of brevet second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Infantry, he was assigned to various bases on the Western frontier duty, as well as performing recruiting services and helping engineer improvement to the Sabine River. Blanchard served in the United States Army for eleven years before resigning his commission as a first lieutenant in 1840.Warner, p. 27. He had a son and daughter by his first wife who died young. His first daughter was Susan Blanchard who later became a noted writer. She married Charles D. Elder of New Orleans. General Blanchard's second wife was Marie Louise Herminie Benoist whom he married in January 1839. The couple moved to her hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the 1840s. He entered the mercantile business there and served as a director of the city's public schools. Blanchard returned to the army in May 1846 with the outbreak of the Mexican War, serving as a captain of the volunteer \\"Phoenix Company\\" in the 2nd Louisiana Infantry. Serving with distinction in the Battle of Monterey and the Siege of Vera Cruz, he was commissioned as a major in the Regular Army in the 12th U.S. Infantry. After the war, he returned to New Orleans and became a teacher in the public schools until 1850. After working a few years as a surveyor, he went to work as secretary and treasurer for two local railroad companies, including the New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad. Civil War When the Civil War erupted in 1861, Blanchard offered his services to his adopted state and received a commission as the colonel of the 1st Louisiana Infantry regiment. After drilling and training his men, they were transported to Norfolk, Virginia. In May, Blanchard took charge of two divisions under Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger. He was promoted to brigadier general on September 21, 1861, and given command of a brigade posted at Portsmouth, Virginia. His brigade was present at the Battle of Seven Pines, but held in reserve. Afterwards, he was replaced by Ambrose R. Wright because of his advancing age and the desire for a younger officer to lead the brigade in the field. Blanchard served in a variety of administrative posts for much of the rest of the war. He served on the court of inquiry for Seth M. Barton in May 1864. In November, he was among the Confederate generals defending Augusta, Georgia, during Sherman's March to the Sea.

History Early years Koil released their first recorded material, a mini album called Demo From Nowhere, in 1994. The released was limited due for financial reasons. Two years later, major label Project Q offered the band a contract for a studio album, which was released in September 1996. Most of the songs on the album were taken from Demo From Nowhere. In 1997, Koil's partnership with Project Q ended, and the band released a single called \\"Kesepian Ini Abadi\\" (\\"This Loneliness stays immortal\\") on their own label, Apocalypse Records, founded by Otong and a close friend of the band, Adam Vladvamp of the band Kubik. Around this time, the band made changes to their stage concept and image, adopting customised leather outfits, black colours, metal accessories, high boots and other items typical of an industrial goth look. After releasing the single, the band started work on their next album, and also became involved in side projects with other bands from their hometown. They also contributed songs to some compilation albums such as Best Alternative Indonesia, Ticket to Ride, and Viking ‚Äì Persib. Megaloblast In February 2001, the band released their second album, Megaloblast, and produced a video for the song \\"Mendekati Surga\\" (\\"Approaching Heaven\\") to promote the album. In October 2003 Alfa Records offered to re-release the album nationwide, and the album was re-released across Indonesia in December 2003. To promote the album, the band produced two more videos, \\"Kita dapat Diselamatkan\\" (\\"We Can Be Saved\\") and \\"Dosa Ini Tak Akan Berhenti\\" (\\"This Sin Will Not Stop\\"). In 2005, the band released two singles, \\"Hiburan Ringan Part I\\" (\\"Light Entertaintment Part I\\") and \\"Hiburan Ringan Part II\\" (\\"Light Entertaintment Part II\\"), which were included on a soundtrack album for the horror movie 12:00 AM. A video was made for the song \\"Hiburan Ringan Part II\\". The band performed on some music festivals and appeared on TV to promote their new single. Blacklight Shines On Otong at Kickfest 2009 Yogyakarta Adam Vladvamp joined the band as a bassist in 2007. After almost a year in the studio, Koil released their third album, Blacklight Shines On, with nine songs. The band made a few copies of the album and gave it away free to fans, also releasing it through the internet. A video was made for the song \\"Semoga Kau Sembuh Part II\\" (\\"Hopefully You Get Sober Part II\\"). Directed by Indonesian film director Rizal Mantovani, the video features the band performing on a stage surrounded by fans. Horror situations gradually start to appear in video as it becomes the soundtrack of a horror movie entitled Kuntilanak. The band toured and performed in some cities in Java and Bali during 2007‚Äì09. In 2009, guitarist Ibrahim Nasution left the band, for undisclosed reasons. The band did not replace him and returned to being a four-piece band. Blacklight Shines On was re-released by major label Nagaswara Records in March 2010, with two new songs and one remixed track added. The cover artwork of the album was also redesigned, and the title shortened to Blacklight.

It adopted this name to distinguish it from Loveman's department stores operating in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and in Nashville, Tennessee. History  The store was founded in 1887, as A.B. Loveman's Dry Goods Emporium at 1915 Second Avenue by Adolph Bernard Loveman. Moses V. Joseph of Selma, Alabama, soon joined the company and it was renamed Loveman & Joseph. In 1889, the company became Loveman, Joseph & Loeb with the addition of Emil Loeb. Loveman's primary location was built in 1890, at 200 19th Street on the corner of 3rd Avenue North. The store was expanded in 1899. By 1911, Loveman's was known as the largest, most magnificent department store south of the Ohio River. In 1917, an add-on known as the Loveman's annex was built between the main building and the Alabama Theatre. In 1923, Loveman, Joseph & Loeb, along with B. Lowenstein, Inc., of Memphis, Tennessee, and Maison Blanche Co., of New Orleans, Louisiana, were the first three department stores of the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based City Stores Company syndicate. The department store was destroyed in a massive fire on March 10, 1934, although the exterior of the annex survived. The store reopened within a few weeks at a temporary location while a new Loveman's building was built on the site of the fire. The new Loveman's building was completed in 1935. There was a clock on corner of the new building, facing the 19th Street/3rd Avenue intersection, which was a popular local landmark. The new department store was one of the first in the nation to be air conditioned, and the first in Alabama to feature an escalator. Loveman's opened its first suburban branch store in Montgomery's Normandale Shopping Center in 1954. In 1966, a store came inline in Huntsville's The Mall. The first Metro Birmingham branch was dedicated, in 1969, at Bessemer's West Lake Mall. Branch stores followed at Fairfield's Western Hills Mall (1970) and Birmingham's Century Plaza (1976). City Stores filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 1979, forcing liquidation of the chain and closing of the flagship downtown store in April 1980. The downtown Loveman's building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 14, 1983. It now houses the McWane Science Center.

Construction Outpost (YAGR‚Äì10) was laid down on 14 April 1945, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 3140, as the Liberty Ship Francis J. O'Gara, by J.A. Jones Construction, Panama City, Florida. She was launched 8 June 1945, and delivered 30 June 1945, to the Calmer Steamship Corp.. Service history Merchant service The Calmer Steamship Corp. operated Francis J. O'Gara for MARCOM from 30 June 1945 until 4 June 1946. Francis J. O'Garas cruises during this period included one to the US West Coast of the United States and one to various European ports. On 4 June 1946 Francis J. O'Gara was laid up in the Hudson River Reserve Fleet, Jones Point, New York, of MARCOM. From 28 January 1947 until 14 January 1948, Francis J. O'Gara was operated by the Waterman Steamship Company and then the South Atlantic Steamship Company. During this period she made cruises to Europe, the Near East, and the Orient. On 20 January 1948, Francis J. O'Gara was laid up in MARCOM's Mobile, Alabama, reserve fleet. US Navy service On 22 May 1956, the US Navy acquired Francis J. O'Gara to be converted into an Ocean Station Radar Ship. Francis J. O'Gara was towed from Mobile, to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where conversion was begun to equip her with the electronic detection equipment and communication gear necessary for her role with the Continental Air Defense Command. She was assigned the Navy hull number YAGR‚Äì10 and commissioned Outpost, 6 February 1957, Lieutenant Commander John Leslie Murphy, USN, in command. After shakedown training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Outpost reported to her homeport, Davisville, Rhode Island, 3 June 1957. On 28 June, the ship steamed seaward on her first patrol and on 30 June, relieved on picket station. The ship returned to Davisville, 19 July, but by 24 July, was underway for another patrol setting the pattern of patrols interrupted by short periods in port. Outpost made a total of six patrols in 1957. These patrols continued into 1958. Outposts designation was changed to AGR‚Äì10 28 September 1958. During the first half of 1961, Outpost steamed on station. But in August she steamed south to Florida and the Bahamas. From October 1961 to January 1962, she underwent overhaul at Boston, Massachusetts. Outpost continued her Atlantic patrols in 1962, buttoning up for wartime steaming during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The onset of 1963 found Outpost steaming on station as before. In late July the ship visited Halifax, Nova Scotia. From August through the end of 1963, Outpost maintained a record of no misses in reporting air contacts. She visited Halifax, again in November before putting into her homeport for the holidays. Early in 1964, she resumed her patrols and continued this pattern of operation until decommissioning 1 July 1965. Decommissioning She was returned to the US Maritime Administration (MARAD) 4 February 1966, and entered the Hudson River Reserve Fleet, Jones Point, New York.

This white hygroscopic solid is of interest as a component of scintillation counters. Preparation and basic properties The compound has been known since at least 1899, when Muthman and St√ºtzel reported its preparation from cerium sulfide and gaseous HBr. Aqueous solutions of CeBr3 can be prepared from the reaction of Ce2(CO3)3¬∑H2O with HBr. The product, CeBr3¬∑H2O can be dehydrated by heating with NH4Br followed by sublimation of residual NH4Br. CeBr3 can be distilled at reduced pressure (~ 0.1 Pa) in a quartz ampoule at 875-880 ¬∞C. Like the related salt CeCl3, the bromide absorbs water on exposure to moist air. The compound melts congruently at 722 ¬∞C, and well ordered single crystals may be produced using standard crystal growth methods like Bridgman or Czochralski. CeBr3 adopts the hexagonal, UCl3-type crystal structure with P63/m Space group. Applications CeBr3-doped lanthanum bromide single crystals are known to exhibit superior scintillation properties for applications in the security, medical imaging, and geophysics detectors. Undoped single crystals of CeBr3 have shown promise as a Œ≥-ray scintillation detector in nuclear non-proliferation testing, medical imaging, environmental remediation, and oil exploration.

During his first spell in Asia he worked in Quinam, Hirado and finally Tayouan (the capital of Dutch Formosa), rising to Chief Merchant (opperkoopman). In 1641 he resigned his position in Formosa to take up another in Hirado, but en route the Dutch were forced to relocate their factory to the artificial island of Dejima by the Japanese government. His work took him back to Formosa, then again to Japan, where he ordered a military action on the west coast of Luzon, which at the time was under enemy (Spanish) control. In 1647 he requested leave, which was granted, and he returned to the Netherlands. Governor of Formosa After returning to Asia in 1651, Caesar was stationed in Batavia. When Nicolas Verburg was to be recalled from Formosa in 1653 it looked as if Carel Hartsinck was set to take over as Governor of the island.

Agricultural products regularly accounted for about 80 to 95 percent of exports until the oil industry came on line. Total sector activities contributed an estimated 35.5 percent of GDP in 2006, a decline from the years prior to the development of the oil industry. Crop cultivation was divided between a market-oriented sector comprising mechanized, large-scale irrigated and rain-fed farming (mainly in central Sudan) and small-scale farming following traditional practices carried out in parts of the country where rainfall or other water sources were sufficient for cultivation. Large investments occurred over time in mechanized, irrigated, and rain-fed agriculture, which together accounted for roughly two-thirds of Sudan‚Äôs cultivated land. The early emphasis on growing cotton on irrigated land decreased. Peanuts, wheat, and sugarcane are major crops, and considerable quantities of sesame also are grown.. Rain-fed mechanized fanning continues to produce mostly sorghum, but the cultivation of sesame has increased, and short-fiber cotton is also grown.. Production in both subsectors increased domestic supplies and export potential. This gain appeared, however, to have been achieved mainly by expanding the cultivated area rather than by increasing productivity. Most subsistence cultivators produced sorghum as their staple crop, although in the northerly rain-fed cultivated areas millet was the principal staple. Subsistence farmers also grew peanuts and sesame. Following food shortages in 2001, there was an attempt to increase land area for the production of food. The increase in food production, however, was at the expense of the production of export crops, although export crops increased in 2004 and the export of sesame and cotton continued to increase through 2008. Land use Farming in the Nuba Mountains Before the secession of South Sudan, the Ministry of Agriculture estimated that Sudan had 84 million hectares of potentially arable land. The area under permanent crops was estimated at more than 19 million hectares in 2010, about 23 percent of potential arable land. Substantial variations existed in land classified as actually used or potentially usable for livestock grazing. The Ministry of Agriculture and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) classified about 24 million hectares as pastureland. In 1975, however, a United Nations interagency mission to Sudan had estimated the total potential grazing land at between 120 million and 150 million hectares. Total forest area declined from 71.2 million hectares in 1990 to 61.6 million hectares in 2000. The use of some woodland areas for grazing, the dearth of rainfall during the 1980s, and the ecological damage from mechanized farming caused steady deforestation. In 2011 Sudan still had a substantial amount of land suitable for future cropping. The 1975 UN mission believed that two- thirds of the potential area for livestock grazing, however, was already in use, and that proportion had probably increased over time with the rising numbers of livestock. In addition to land suitable for cultivation and livestock grazing, Sudan also had about 76 million to 86 million hectares of desert. An area of about 2.9 million hectares was covered by swamps and inland water, and additional land was occupied by urban settlements and other man- made features. Land tenure The right to own property, to bequeath it to heirs, and to inherit it was established by the 1973 constitution (then known as the Permanent Constitution), although that right was suspended in 1985.. Sudan has long had a system of land registration through which an individual, an enterprise, or the government can establish title to a piece of land. Such registration was extensive in Northern Sudan, especially in the then-states of Al-Khartoum, Al-Awsat, and Ash Shamali. Before 1970 all other land (unregistered) belonged to the state, which held ownership in trust for the people, who had customary rights to it. The Unregistered Land Act of 1970 declared that all waste, forest, and unregistered lands were government land. Private land was limited to that registered before 1970 under a 1929 land ordinance and was limited to agricultural land along the Nile and a few areas along other water courses. Such land amounted to only about 1 percent of all land. Individuals could, however, lease land from the government and gain usufruct rights. The government owned most of the land used by the modern agricultural sector and leased it to tenants (for example, in the Gezira Scheme) or to private entrepreneurs, such as most operators of large-scale mechanized rain-fed farming.. The lease rights were for specified periods of time; for example, leases rights for the large mechanized farms were typically for 25 years.. There were also many variants of land tenure. The communal land used for pasture and for subsistence cultivation was owned by the government but under the control of the community or local leader, who allocated it to households of the village or ethnic group for their exclusive cultivation. The rights to such land might be passed on to heirs, but ordinarily the land could not be sold or otherwise disposed of, nor used as collateral. The right was also retained to land left fallow, although in Bahr al-Ghazal, Upper Nile, and Equatoria there were communities where another individual could claim such land by clearing it. Among the transhumant communities of the North, the rights to cultivated land were much the same, but the dominant position of livestock in community activities introduced certain other communal rights that included common rights to grazing land, the right-of-way to water and grazing land, the right to grass on agricultural land unless the occupier cut and stacked it, and the right to crop residues unless similarly treated. In the western savannas, private ownership of stands of hashab (gum arabic) trees could be registered, an exception to the usual government ownership of the forests, but dead wood for domestic fuel and the underlying grass were common property. Water, a matter of greatest importance to stock raisers, was open to all if free standing, but wells and the associated drinking troughs were private property and retained by the digger season after season. In Northern Sudan, especially in the western region where increasing population and animal numbers placed pressure on the land, violations of customary laws and conflicts between ethnic groups over rights to pasturage and water increased during the 1990s and early 2000s. These were major factors behind the warfare that began in Western Sudan in early 2003. Crops Sesame seed became Sudan‚Äôs prime agricultural export commodity in the mid-1990s, and it was also used domestically to produce oil for cooking.. The yield varied in recent years, with a production of 416,000 tonnes in 1996. It was 350,000 tonnes in 2008 and about 248,000 tonnes in 2010 because of a decline in productivity. As of 2018, Sudan produced 981,000 tons of sesame seed, making it the world's largest producer. Sudan production in 2018, by FAO Sesame exports earned US$141 million in 1996, some 23 percent of export revenues. They decreased to US$93 million in 2007, constituting 1.2 percent of export earnings, but increased to US$167.3 million in 2010. Gum arabic is the most important forest product of Sudan, which accounts for 80 percent of the world‚Äôs supply. It is collected from acacia trees in Darfur and Kordofan and used widely in industry for products ranging from mucilage (for postage stamps), to foam stabilizers, to excipient in medicines and dietetic foods. The Gum Arabic Company markets the product, with restraints placed on the right of any private company to independently export unprocessed gum arabic. The justification given for regulating its sale is that its quality would deteriorate and export quantities and prices would decline if sales were deregulated. Moreover, even though gum arabic requires minimal processing and packaging, the prices received by producers in 2000-2001 were only 21 percent of world market prices. Export markets for it are price sensitive, as there are synthetic substitutes and competition from Chad, Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, and Nigeria. Production in 1994-95 was 84,000 tonnes. It declined to 16,000 tonnes by 2000 but surpassed 30,000 tonnes in 2010. Export earnings were US$40 million in 2003 and about US$24 million in 2010. Gezira Peanuts are one of Sudan‚Äôs major cash crops. Peanuts grow on rain-fed land in the far west and also under irrigation. They are both a domestic source of food and oil and a major export. Production had been decreasing as a result of low producer prices, low world market prices, disease, and drought, but conditions turned around in the early 2000s. Production was 1.2 million tonnes in 2003, although revenues remained low. Production dropped around 2008-2010, but Sudan produced 2.8 million tons of peanuts as of 2018, making Sudan the fourth largest producer in the world. Exports provided US$741,000 in 2007 and US$200,000 in 2010. Sorghum is the Sudanese staple food crop, but the yield varies, depending on weather conditions and the amount of irrigated land used for it. Production is also cyclical; when there are large surpluses of the grain, prices fall, discouraging production in the subsequent year. Output reached a high of nearly 5.2 million tonnes in 2003 but declined to 3.9 million tonnes in 2008 and to an estimated 2.6 million tonnes in 2010 as production continued to drop. In 2018, Sudan produced 4.9 million tons of sorghum, making it the world's third-largest producer. Exports in 2010 realized an estimated US$200,000. Karima Wheat is also grown in irrigated areas as an import substitute.. Its production varies in a pattern similar to that of sorghum, reacting to changes in prices. Production was 587,000 tonnes in 2008 but fell to 403,000 tonnes in 2010 because of a decrease in the cultivated area. As of 2018, Sudan produced 595,000 tons of wheat. Overall, grain production (sorghum, millet, and wheat) is insufficient for rising domestic demand, even with good harvests in recent years, requiring Sudan to depend upon imports, especially imports of wheat. As of 2018, Sudan produced 2.6 million tons of millet, making it the third largest producer in the world. Sugar production began in the 1960s to replace the second most expensive import after petroleum. The largest of the parastatal sugar projects, the Kananah Sugar Project, opened in 1981 and was important in eliminating sugar imports by 1986. In 1999 plans were announced for a large production facility in the White Nile region, with major funding from the Chinese government. Sudan and the People‚Äôs Republic of China also agreed to build a sixth sugar plant. And, in May 2002, Sudan inaugurated a new facility at the state-owned Sudan Sugar Company in New Haifa, which by the late 2000s produced 60,000 tonnes of white sugar per year. In 2008 sugar cane production throughout Sudan totaled 7.5 million tonnes. In 2018, production in Sudan was 5.9 million tons. Kassala Cotton was traditionally the most important export crop and the major irrigated crop, but it has declined in importance. The main types of cotton grown were medium-staple Akala, some long-staple Barakat, and a little long- medium staple Shambat B. A small amount of rain-fed, short-staple cotton was also grown. Cotton‚Äôs contribution to export revenue decreased from 53 percent in the 1970s to 1 percent in 2008. Exports of cotton provided US$134 million in earnings in 2008 but fell to an estimated US$40.4 million in 2010. In 2018, Sudan produced 160,000 tons of cotton. As of 2018, Sudan also produced 1.5 million tons of onions, 951,000 tons of banana, 907 thousand tons of mango (including mangosteen and guava), 674,000 tons of tomato, 442,000 tons of potato, 440,000 tons of date, 304,000 tons of okra, 283 thousand tons of lemon, 240,000 tons of cucumber, 234,000 tons of grapefruit, 234,000 tons of sweet potato, 187,000 tons of yam, 172,000 tons of watermelon, 161,000 tons of orange, and smaller quantities of other agricultural products. Irrigated agriculture Sudan had a modern irrigated agriculture sector totaling about 800,000 hectares in 2010, out of about 84 million hectares that were potentially arable. This was a slight decline from the prior year and well below the more than 2 million hectares of the early 1990s. The Nile and its tributaries were the source of water for 93 percent of irrigated agriculture, and of this, the Blue Nile accounted for about 67 percent. Gravity flow was the main form of irrigation, although pumps served part of the irrigated area.A Sudanese farmer operating an irrigation pumpThe waters of the Nile in Sudan were used for centuries for traditional irrigation, taking advantage of the annual Nile flood.. Such usage continued in the early 2000s, along with the traditional shaduf (a device to raise water) and waterwheel to lift water to fields in local irrigation projects. These devices were rapidly being replaced by more efficient mechanized pumps. Among the first efforts to employ irrigation for modern commercial cropping was the use of the floodwaters of the Qash River and the Barakah River (both of which originate in Eritrea) in eastern Sudan to grow cotton on their deltas, which began in the 1860s. Between the 1940s and the 1970s, various projects were developed to irrigate land. Both deltas yielded only one crop a year, watered by the flood. Adequate groundwater, however, offered the eventual possibility of using pump irrigation from local wells for additional cropping or for supplementing any flood shortages. Since the 1950s, the government has constructed a number of large pump projects, mostly on the Blue Nile.. These have included the Junayd project on the east bank of the Blue Nile east of the Gezira Scheme. In the 1970s, when the consumption and import of sugar grew rapidly, domestic production became a priority. Consequently, two major pump-irrigated sugar plantations were established on the White Nile in the Kosti area. The government's Dams Implementation Unit signed contracts in 2010 with two Chinese companies for a US$838 million project in northeastern Sudan. The Upper Atbarah Dams Complex Project would comprise two dams, on the Setit and the Atbarah, and the Upper Nile Dam. The project was part of the dam- construction program that included the building of the 1,250-megawatt Merowe Dam and the heightening of the Roseires Dam. The new dams were expected to contribute to the irrigation of some 210,000 hectares of agricultural land and to help revitalize land in the New Haifa Agricultural Scheme. Rainfed agriculture Irrigation of the Nile delta Cultivation dependent on rainfall falls into two categories.. Most Sudanese farmers had always relied on rainfed fanning. In addition to these traditional farms, there is a large modern mechanized rainfed agricultural sector. Mechanized rainfed agriculture  The mechanized rainfed agricultural sector developed after 1944-45, when a government project to cultivate the cracking clays of central Sudan started in the area of Al-Gedaref (also seen as Al-Qadarif). Its prime purpose was to meet the food needs of army units stationed in British colonies in East Africa (present-day Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda). The alkaline clays and loams in this area were not suitable for cultivation by hand or by oxen. An average of about 6,000 hectares a year was cultivated between 1945 and 1953, chiefly producing sorghum, under a sharecropping arrangement between the government and fanners who had been allocated land in the project. These estates proved costly, however, and in 1954 the government began encouraging the private sector to take up mechanized fanning in the area, a policy that continued after Sudan gained independence in 1956. The government maintained several state farms to demonstrate production methods and to conduct research, but research activities were very limited because of staffing and funding problems. The private-sector response was positive, and by 1960 mechanized farming had spread into other areas of the cracking-clay zone in central and eastern Sudan.. The government set aside rectangular areas that were divided into plots of 420 hectares (later raised in places to 630 hectares) each.. Half of these plots were leased to private fanners, the other half left fallow. After four years, the originally leased land was to be returned to fallow and the farmer was to receive a new lease for an adjacent fallow area. When the demand for land grew faster than it could be demarcated, areas outside the designated project limits were taken over by private individuals. The four-year lease proved unpopular because it meant new investment in clearing land every four years, and apparently much of the worked land continued to be cultivated while fallow land was also placed under cultivation. The investment requirements for mechanized farming favored prosperous cultivators, and eventually most farms came to be operated by entrepreneurs who raised capital through mortgageable property or other assets in the urban centers. Through arrangements with other individuals, these entrepreneurs frequently managed to control additional plots beyond the legal limit of two. Their ability to obtain capital permitted them also to abandon depleted land and to move into newly demarcated uncleared areas, a practice that had a deleterious impact on the environment, deprived the indigenous inhabitants of work opportunities, and increased desertification. The government established the Mechanized Farming Corporation (MFC) in 1968 as an autonomous agency under the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, to expand the operator base and to introduce more control over land allocation, crops, and farming methods. With loans from the IDA, the MFC was able to provide technical assistance, credit for land clearing and machinery, and marketing aid to individual farmers and cooperative groups. The MFC also became the operator of state farms. The area under this system of management by the late 1990s had spread to about 5.9 million hectares in the states of Al-Gedaref, Blue Nile, Upper Nile, White Nile, Sinnar, and South Kordofan. The farms were then usually well over 420 hectares as a result of combining leased plots and creating family partnerships. The government also allocated large plots of 21,000^420,000 hectares to Sudanese and Gulf state investors. Only a few crops were suitable for cultivation in the cracking-clay area, principally sorghum. Sesame and short-fiber cotton also grew successfully but in relatively smaller quantities. Land preparation, seeding, and most threshing were mechanized on these farms, but some threshing, as well as weeding and harvesting, was done by seasonal labor. Traditional rain-fed agriculture Traditional rain-fed farming involves nomadic and seminomadic peoples and transhumance, as well as settled agriculture, which also includes significant numbers of livestock.. Although almost all these systems exist in every state, they are most prevalent in the Kordofan and Darfur States, Sinnar, and the Blue Nile and White Nile States. Livestock, part of almost every farming system, serve as both a capital asset and a hedge against the risk of farming, particularly because of recurrent droughts. Settled farmers usually produce a combination of food crops and cash crops, such as karkade (hibiscus), sesame, and watermelon, on 4.2 to 6.3 hectares. The total area under crops in the traditional rain-fed fanning system in 2010 was estimated to be almost 12 million hectares. South Sudan has three zones where traditional agricultural systems prevail. The Central Rainlands Zone in Upper Nile State receives less than 800 millimeters of rainfall per year. Vegetation in the zone is open grasslands, bush thickets, and thorn woodland where quick-maturing grains and oilseeds are produced. Semi-mechanized farming has begun to take over where farm size is large enough to break even on the investment. The Flood Plains Zone includes the remainder of the Upper Nile State and also parts of Bahr al- Ghazal and Equatoria. Rainfall ranges from 800 to 1,000 millimeters per year, concentrated in six to seven months. Vegetation is open grasslands with acacia woodlands. The sudd, in this area, is a permanent or semipermanent swamp that mainly produces papyrus. Farming takes place on the high land; the lower land is the most important cattle-grazing land in the South. The Equatorial Zone includes the Ironstone Plateau, the Central Hills, and the Green Belt in Equatoria. Rainfall is usually 900-1,300 millimeters per year, concentrated in six to eight months, although it is much higher in the Green Belt. Farm production includes perennial tree crops, such as coffee, tea, and oil palm, and annual crops, such as tobacco, cotton, com, sorghum, groundnuts, sesame, and vegetables. Tsetse-fly infestation makes it difficult to raise livestock in the area. Animal husbandry Baqqara people with cattle, Sudan Livestock raising is important throughout Sudan except in the extremely dry areas of the North. It provides a large part or the entire livelihood of nearly half the population of Sudan, mainly in the traditional farming sector. In recent years, the government has encouraged commercial livestock production of camels, goats, sheep, and cattle for sale abroad. The range of offerings in the sector includes live animal exports, meat, hides and skins, and dairy products. Livestock is of increasing importance in the agricultural economy, and it has become the fastest growing non-oil export sector. The Arab states of the Persian Gulf, especially Saudi Arabia, are the source of especially strong demand for Sudan‚Äôs livestock. Sudanese cattle are of two principal varieties: Baqqara and Nilotic. The Baqqara and two subvarieties constitute the majority of the country‚Äôs cattle. This breed is found chiefly in the western savanna regions and in fewer, although significant, numbers farther to the east as far north as Kassala. Because of periodic rinderpest epidemics, the total number of cattle was relatively small until about 1930. A vaccination program begun about that time, and mass inoculations during the succeeding decades resulted in a great increase in numbers. In the vast areas used by pastoral herders, cattle husbandry is conducted in an economic, cultural, and social context that evolved over generations.. This includes an emphasis on increasing herd size as an investment for future family security. Small surpluses (usually bulls) are available for subsistence use, exchange, or sale for local consumption or export. Cattle are also used for marriage payments and for rituals. Numbers of cattle help to establish or increase status and power in a social system in which cattle are the measure of wealth. Transhumant groups own most of the Nilotic variety of cattle, and their migrations, related to the wet and dry seasons, usually do not exceed 150-160 kilometers. The majority of Baqqara cattle belong to the Baqqara Arabs, who were once largely nomadic, but since at least the early 1900s usually maintained a settled base in which to cultivate crops. The farmers, their relatives, or their agents move the cattle over traditional migratory routes northward during the rainy season and southward to the area of the Bahr al- Arab as the dry season progresses. Migrations in either direction might amount to 400 kilometers. The expansion of mechanized rain-fed agriculture in the region used by the Baqqara, continued government efforts to enlarge the cultivated area, and pressures on the land from the growing population gradually reduced grazing areas. At the same time, traditional cultural forces brought about a steady increase in cattle numbers. The result was a growing overstock and pasture depletion until the outbreak of civil war in 1983, which was followed by the devastating droughts of the 1980s and early 1990s that greatly reduced livestock numbers throughout Sudan. Sheep are herded chiefly by transhumants in Darfur and Kordofan. Large numbers are found in the drier areas at greater elevations than the usual cattle zone. There were several breeds but the predominant and preferred one is the so-called desert sheep, which has both good weight and good milk yield. Villagers in Al-Gedaref and Sinnar also raise large numbers of sheep, mostly on a nonmigratory basis. Fodder comes from crop residues on irrigated and rain-fed farms and from vegetation along the rivers and canals. Herders at the camel market on the far west side of Omdurman Goats, of which there are three principal breeds (desert, Nubian, and Nilotic), are found throughout the country south of the northern desert areas. They are raised mainly by settled families for milk and meat. Goat meat, although less popular than mutton, forms part of the diet of most families, particularly the poorer ones. Goat milk is an important source of protein, and many families in urban areas keep a few goats for their milk. Camel farming in Sudan is largely concentrated in the desert and subdesert regions of northern Darfur, northern Kordofan, and southern Al-Gedaref. They are kept almost entirely by nomadic and seminomadic peoples, for whom the animal represents the preferred mode of transport. Camels are also important for milk and for meat.. Camel ownership and numbers are sources of prestige in nomadic societies.. Donkeys, horses, and a small number of pigs (kept by such non-Muslim peoples as the Nuba) are also raised in Sudan. Poultry is raised mainly by farm families and villagers, although a modern sector consisting of government commercial operations and some semicommercial private ventures has developed. A significant poultry industry exists in Khartoum, and beekeeping has also been introduced. Men riding donkeys, Sudan In 1983 Sudan‚Äôs more than 50 million animals comprised the second largest national herd in Africa, exceeded only by that of Ethiopia. By 1991 the herd had been reduced by perhaps one-third by the droughts of the 1980s-1991, the August 1988 floods in the South, described as the worst in Sudan's history, and the ravages of civil war in the South. Many families and indeed whole ethnic groups, who traditionally survived on their cattle, sheep, goats, or camels, lost all of their herds and were forced to migrate to the Three Towns (Omdurman, Khartoum, and Khartoum North) in search of sustenance. Total livestock production increased rapidly in the second half of the 1990s. The numbers of sheep quadrupled in the 1990s in response to the export market in the Persian Gulf states, especially Saudi Arabia. In 2000, however, exports were affected by an outbreak of Rift Valley fever in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government blamed the problem on livestock imported from East Africa, and Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states placed a ban on imports from the region, which had a severe impact on Sudan‚Äôs livestock sector.. By 2004, livestock had rebounded from the impact of drought, floods, and Gulf-state import bans, with sales in that year of US$134 million.. Another outbreak of Rift Valley fever caused some losses once again in 2007-8 and resulted in temporary import restrictions against Sudanese livestock. Sales declined to US$80 million in 2007, and to US$42 million in 2008. Total livestock numbered almost 142 million head in 2010, including nearly 42 million cattle, 52 million sheep, 43.4 million goats, and 4.6 million camels, as well as thousands of horses, donkeys, and mules. The same year, Sudan exported 91,700 head of livestock at an estimated value of US$136 million. Further growth of the sector was predicted as Gulf investors, particularly from Saudi Arabia, had committed to investment in new production facilities.

History  It is said that the town starts with the Indians Ic√≥s, branch of the tribe of Cariris Old, who chose the region that today is Uira√∫na by the presence of fish from the river, which at the time was the main means of survival. Around 1768 was donated to Alferes Moreira and Joao Nunes Leit√£o sesmaria of the number 323, in the colonial period, specifically at the time of capitanias hereditary. Thus began arriving cattle farmers who have settled in the region where they developed their business. The coming of creators had as the main reason the sugar competition with the West, who made several captains and colonels clearing the sert√£o go in search of the area for planting, but instead plant began to encourage more livestock and the front door would be of entry for the expansion of cotton growing. Also in the period of slavery was born in Brazil, especially in the states of the Northeast and South, a new class of workers, the tropeiros, which had role of extreme importance to the towns and cities of the interior, because in the absence of trucks (which was invented in 1896, but for having very high cost only came to Brazil decades later) they were going in the conduct of troops of mules in other cities seek products that the interior needed. The tropeiros uiraunenses were known as \\"Tropeiros of the Hinterland\\" and generally went to Mossor√≥ in search of rapadura, cotton and flour. Following a jump in time and arrive in a period known as Old Republic is Bethlehem, land already well developed in that era was the scene of two major rebellions famous until today, they are the Column Prestes and Lampi√£o. Column Miguel Costa Prestes, better known by Column Prestes was a politico-military movement that preached the dissatisfaction with the Old Republic, the requirement of secret ballots and the defense of public education, led by Luis Carlos Prestes rebellion passing through the land of Father France, first by the community of Aparecida, shortly after arriving at Luis Gomes and then returning to the land uiraunenses vai d'Water Dry Eye, then to Santa Umbelina and also to Quixaba, when part toward the city of Vieir√≥polis. Lampi√£o was the most famous cangaceiro the history of Brazil, in Uira√∫na their visits (1927) were considerably faster and both the first and second did the same path. A curious fact is the comment that was from the rearward of Lampi√£o in the region which began to lose in their battles until eleven years later was dead. Also in the corresponding period the Old Republic was a fact that influenced the formation of the city, this event was the uprising of Juazeiro, which was an armed confrontation between the oligarchies cearenses and the federal government caused by interference from the central power in state politics, or in 1911 the mayor of Juazeiro do Norte Father Cicero decided not to accept some orders of the federal government, in response the government sent troops establishing a genuine internal conflict throughout cearense, so many people with fear of what could happen if refuge in other cities, thus four musicians from the town of Old Mission in Uira√∫na stop and came in search of employment sought Father Costa that together had the idea of teaching music to uiraunenses thus was born in 1914 in Banda Costa Correia, which today is called Banda Jesus, Mary and Joseph and gives the council the title of land of musicians. You cannot stop speaking in that rescue the past, cotton, as it had said before were the cattle farmers of the nineteenth century that gave great contribution to its development in these lands. The \\"white gold\\" as it was formerly called if adequou perfectly to the ground and uiraunense Para√≠ba, and as there were several high yield cotton plants came to Uira√∫na, as SAMBRA and ALGASA. The city lived on cotton and its development came through it by bringing the PARAIBAN as banks, Caixa Economica Federal and Bradesco, but an insect from Central America, the bicudo, infested the entire Brazil bringing very high losses for the city as the prime example end of all these companies mentioned above and the loss of all production, leading Uira√∫na and all Brazil to a serious crisis. Point in the tourist area of rural Uira√∫na - The dam of Capivara Chegando in 1953, he seo former district, now emancipated and new name - Uira√∫na - the first being appointed mayor by the governor of Paraiba, at the time, Joao Fernandes de Lima. The first elections were to happen was born in 1955 when the first parties and their respective lideran√ßas.Comandado by Osvaldo Bezerra Cascudo the Social Democratic Party (PSD) was characterised on the national level, for its broad representation throughout Brazil and to be formed by politicians Conservatives associated with Get√∫lio Vargas, because the National Democratic Union (UDN) was led by Olinto Pinheiro which was characterised by the representation of the opposition in the city and also in Brazil. In a similar policy between the Brazilian and uiraunense, it is noted that both had similar characteristics, as in the period from 1945 to 1960 in Brazil only won the party linked to Vargas (PSD and PTB) and only by his populism in 1961 J√¢nio Quadros ( the UDN) was elected, also Uira√∫na, from 1956 to 1963 it won only candidates linked to the PSD of Cascudo in 1964 and only the opposition Joaquim Moreira (UDN) is also elected by his populism and his innovative ideas. In 1964 Brazil was through enormous transformations generated by the coup, leading to military dictatorship, which shook the nation and brought profound changes. Because at the time a city of small, the impact of the scheme were not as large in area, only on the wheels of society was discussed the matter and some students and teachers protested what was happening, but not entusiasmaram to rebel. The changes were small, only the PSD of Cascudo has been called MDB and UDN, Olinto became the ARENA.  Emancipation policy  The struggle for political autonomy began around 1942, and completed only on December 2, 1953, under State Law, number 972. Signed by the then governor of Paraiba, Jose Fernandes de Lima, the law provided for the official installation of the municipality of December 27 of that year.

Mingaud; born 4 January 1771 Le Cailar, N√Æmes, France, died 23 December 1847, Rotterdam, NetherlandsHistory of Snooker Games, Michael Stook. Citing Roberts on Billiards (1869), John Roberts, Sr.History of Billiards - profile of Fran√ßois Mingaud ) was an infantry officer in the French army and a carom billiards player. He is credited as the inventor of the leather for a billiards cue, a \\"possibly not original idea\\" that he perfected while imprisoned in Bic√™tre (now Bic√™tre Hospital) for political outspokenness. This revolutionized the game of billiards, allowing the cue ball to be finely manipulated by the application of . In 1807 he was released from prison and began to demonstrate his invention and spin technique in Paris. Part of his showmanship involved feigning extreme horror as the cue ball recoiled towards him after striking the object ball, and then persuading the audience that the balls should be seized and condemned because they were \\"tormented by a devil\\". Mingaud is also credited with the discovery that by raising the cue vertically he could perform what is now known as a shot. Personal life Mingaud was born in 1771 in Le Cailar near N√Æmes in the D√©partement of the Gard in France. He joined the army under Napoleon and served as a captain. After his release from prison in Paris during 1807 he toured France and Europe demonstrating his 'trick shot' prowess. In 1822 Mingaud settled on the Hoogstraat in Rotterdam and by 1825, when he was 54, he had remarried. Billiards French archives show Mingaud was arrested in the Netherlands for \\"involvement in the conspiracy of Cadoudal,\\" (referring to Georges Cadoudal) and labeled an \\"adventurer whose presence in society can only be dangerous.\\" on Archives Nationales: Salle des inventaires virtuelle. Retrieved 3 June 2015. He was imprisoned in Bic√™tre, a men's prison in Paris which is now the site of Bic√™tre Hospital. (Many internet sources incorrectly report the Bastille as the site of Mingaud's imprisonment, but this is impossible. The Bastille was destroyed in 1789 during the French Revolution prior to Mingaud's incarceration.) In prison, Mingaud had access to a billiard-table and so studied the game of billiards. In this age of simple wooden cues, others had experimented with leather tips, but it was Mingaud who perfected both the design and the appropriate playing technique.Forgotten History - Fran√ßois Mingaud From \\"Roberts on Billiards\\" by John Roberts (Senior) published 1869. On Snookergames.com (Archiv.is). Retrieved 5 July 2013. In or about 1790 a new practice of rounding off the entire tip further decreased slippage. Some publications credit Mingaud with not just the invention of the leather cue tip but with the practice of rounding off a cue's terminus, while other publications ascribe the practice to no particular author. Regardless, application of spin remained a hit or miss affair, with no fine control yet possible, and miscues still \\"unavoidable where hard wood came in contact with slippery ivory.\\" Application of or \\"twist\\" (sometimes called \\"English\\", especially in North America) was at the time an unknown artform. Impact on the game In 1807, Mingaud was released from Bic√™tre. Mingaud then began to demonstrate his invention and technique in the caf√©s of Paris. He reportedly developed a repertoire of 40 shots, including glancing blows, side-spin, backspin, topspin and the raised cue 'mass√©' shots. The Guardian / The Observer, The 10: sports gear inventions by Tim Harris, Sunday 10 January 2010 The patrons of the cafes were astonished by the displays of control and manipulation of the cue ball that they had never seen nor imagined possible. In a short time Mingaud's cue tip innovation became the norm and rapid improvements in the game followed in its wake. In 1823 cue tips from Europe were introduced into the United States, but as their fame had long since preceded them, some of domestic make were already in use.Further development of the leather cue tip - 'H√©nine Ain√©' was founded in 1830 and improved Mingaud's invention by creating the 'screw-in tip', making tip replacement a much easier affair. Soon after the introduction of cue tips in France Carom billiards, requiring heavy manipulation of spin, became popular and the scoring by way of \\"hazards\\" or pockets was gradually abolished. Reputation Mingaud's reputation grew rapidly and he became known as the 'great master of the game'. According to Roberts on Billiards published in 1893 by John Roberts : > A few years later [after 1807] he became known as the great master of the > game. He could nurse a break, screw, and cause his ball to follow with the > utmost nicety and certainty. > Mingaud quietly advanced, took up [the cue] and struck the white ball, > which, after contact with the red, recoiled upon him. Affecting extreme > horror, he dropped the cue, and summoned the waiter, to whom he explained > that when he had pushed a ball forward it ran backwards. The spectators were > incredulous, and, in reply to their entreaties, Mingaud attempted another > stroke, but with the same result. The balls were seized and condemned as > \\"tormented by a devil\\", Man playing billiards with a cue and a woman with a mace, from an illustration appearing in Michael Phelan's 1859 book, The Game of Billiards. Invention of the Mass√© shot Mingaud is also credited with the discovery that by raising the cue vertically, to the position adopted by the mace (The forerunner of the cue, similar to a light-weight golf club, with a square- fronted foot that was generally used to shove rather than strike the cue ball.), he could perform what is now known as a shot. Book - Noble Jeu de Billard Credit page from The Noble Game of Billiards, John Thurston's 1831 second edition translation of M. Mingaud's 1827 French treatise, Noble Jeu de Billard In 1827, Mingaud published a book in Paris titled Noble Jeu de Billiard - Coups extraordinaires et surprenans. (The Noble Game of Billiards. Extraordinary and surprising strokes) It contained 43 copper-plate images and precise instructions for performing 70 strokes. Circa 1830, this book was translated and published in English by the Billiards table Manufacturer John Thurston of 14 Catherine Street, The Strand.

In the 1990s, Cees Sprangers, Dongen, The Netherlands, began to research the 'lost mystery' that Mingaud had become. His results were for a first time published in the Dutch monthly magazine 'Biljart' in May 1991 and November 1992, later on in essay form in 1994 in Victor Stein and Paul Rubino's Billiard Encyclopedia. He revealed many details of Mingaud's life, including his first name, fleshed out his personal history, and to a large extent, clarified the details on his role in the invention of the leather cue tip.

Life Born in Leiston in Suffolk, Garrett was the grandson of Richard Garrett, who founded the technical machinery works at Leiston, and Elizabeth Newson, after whom he was named. Newson was the youngest of three sons and not academically inclined, although he possessed the family‚Äôs entrepreneurial spirit. When he finished school, the small town of Leiston offered little to Newson, so he left for London to make his fortune. There, he fell in love with his brother's sister-in-law, Louisa Dunnell, the daughter of an innkeeper of Suffolk origin. After their wedding, the couple lived in a pawnbroker's shop at 1 Commercial Road, Whitechapel.Christine Clark, ‚ÄòGarrett, Newson (1812‚Äì1893)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, (Oxford: University, September 2004) The Garretts had their first four children in quick succession: Louisa, Elizabeth (who would become the first woman in Britain to qualify as a physician and surgeon), Dunnell Newson (who died in infancy) and Newson Dunnell. The family moved to 142 Long Acre, where they lived for two years; two more children were born, Edmund in 1840 and Alice in 1842, and Newson moved up in the world, becoming not only the manager of a larger pawnbroker's shop, but also a silversmith.Manton, p. 23 Garrett's grandfather, the owner of the family engineering works, Richard Garrett & Sons, had died in 1837, leaving the business to his eldest son, Garrett's uncle. Despite his lack of capital, Newson was determined to be successful and in 1840 he moved his family to the Uplands in Aldeburgh.Manton, p. 25 In March 1841, he bought the business of Osborne and Fennell, barley and coal merchants at Snape Bridge. Using the River Alde to transport barley across Britain and into Europe on Thames barges, within three years of his arrival, Garrett was shipping 17,000 quarters (216 t) of barley a year from Snape. Much of this barley would have been destined for breweries, where it had first to be malted. Newson saw an opportunity and in 1854 he began malting at Snape, and was soon shipping malt, rather than barley to the breweries. Newson's business at the Maltings expanded and five more children were born, Agnes (1845), an interior designer; Millicent (1847), a leader in the constitutional campaign for women's suffrage; Samuel (1850), Josephine (1853) and George (1854). By 1850, Newson was a prosperous businessman and was able to build Alde House, a mansion on a hill behind Aldeburgh. The success of the maltings established Garrett as an eminent businessman. In 1889, he was elected to the position of Mayor of Aldeburgh; fifteen years later his daughter Elizabeth became the first woman mayor in the United Kingdom by taking the same post. Death and legacy He was buried in the parish church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, Aldeburgh, where there is a commemorative plaque on the wall. The maltings at Snape Bridge was closed in the 1960s but, through the leadership of the composer Benjamin Britten, was converted into the Snape Maltings Concert Hall, which has become the principal venue for the annual Aldeburgh Festival of Music and the Arts.

Traudenius was a descendant of a family of teachers in Gouda. His grandfather, also Paulus Traudenius, was in 1573 the first rector of the local Latin school after the reformation and had Latinized his original name Trudens to Traudenius. In 1630 grandson Traudenius is registered as a merchant for the Dutch East India Company in Tayouan on Taiwan. In 1633 he became a head merchant at Quinam, but was also active along the coast of China, in the Pescadores and on Taiwan. He married twice, in April 1633 in Batavia with Elisabeth de Meester from Rotterdam, and in 1641 at Fort Zeelandia with Adriana Quina, widow of the former governor of Taiwan, Johan van der Burg. In 1643 he was recalled from Formosa to Batavia, where he soon thereafter died.  Acts as governor Two years after the Dutch established Fort Zeelandia in southern Taiwan, the Spanish responded by establishing a fort at Santissima Trinidad in 1629 and Fort Santo Domingo in 1629. By 1641 the Spanish had become such an irritant to the Dutch in the south that it was decided to take northern Taiwan from the Spanish by force. In the usual courteous terms, Traudenius informed the Spanish governor of their intentions. The Spanish governor was not inclined to give in so easily, and replied in kind. Subsequently, on 24‚Äì27 November 1641, the Dutch launched an assault on the northern regions, but the Spanish positions were well- defended and the attacking troops were not able to breach the walls of the fortresses. They returned, thwarted, to Fort Zeelandia, but a second attack in 1642 was effective and the Spanish abandoned their bases on Formosa.

The Pescadores were Chinese territory, and after a failed accord, Nan Juyi the governor of Fujian sent an army to attack Peng-hu in July 1624.The Dutch on Formosa Sonck arrived at the Pescadores on 1 August on board the ship Zeelandia. On 25 August, after negotiations via Li Dan, head of the illegal traders on Taiwan, Sonck succumbed under the pressure and withdrew his contingent to Formosa, where he founded Fort Zeelandia near the town Anping. The Dutch monopolized the harbour, while Zheng Zhilong, or Nicolas Iquan, became a privateer for the Dutch, attacking trade between China and Manila. This constituted the beginning of the colonial presence of the Dutch on Formosa. Sonck was governor of Dutch Formosa for only one year, as he drowned in Anping harbour in August 1625.

Born at Parkville, Melbourne, daughter of Scottish-born Thomas Jollie Smith and his Victorian wife Jessie Ochiltree. Brought up at Naracoorte, South Australia, where her father was Presbyterian minister. She was educated at home, later boarding at Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne in 1903/04 in order to matriculate. Christian studied law at the University of Melbourne (LL.B., 1911) and was introduced to socialism by her friend Guido Baracchi. She belonged to a group of left-wing intellectuals including William Earsman, Louis Esson and his wife Hilda, and Katharine Susannah Prichard, and was active in the anti-conscription campaigns of World War I. Jollie Smith was admitted by the Supreme Court of Victoria as a solicitor in 1912, her sponsors being \\"Mr McArthur, KC and Mr Latham\\" (later a Chief Justice of Australia). In Victoria, she struggled for independence from her parents, working from 1914 onwards, as a solicitor, teacher, journalist and (briefly as taxi-driver, in 1918 - the first woman taxi-driver in Melbourne, under the trade name 'Pamela Brown'). In 1919 she taught English literature at Melbourne High, Brighton Grammar schools, and on moving to Sydney, at the Labor College of New South Wales. In December 1920 she became a foundation committee-member of the Communist Party of Australia and published the Sydney-based Australian Communist from 1920‚Äì21. Christian Jollie Smith became the second woman to be admitted as a solicitor in New South Wales on 30 October 1924. She established her own practice dealing chiefly with political and industrial cases. During the attempted exclusion of Egon Kisch from Australia she briefed Albert Piddington and Maurice Blackburn who won appeals in the High Court of Australia against charges that he was a prohibited immigrant (successfully challenging the validity of the dictation test given).. In 1951 Jollie Smith briefed H. V. Evatt, in a successful challenge to the validity of the Act outlawing the Communist Party. In 1956, she, together with Brian Fitzpatrick helped draft Jessie Street's a petition to change the constitutional rights of Indigenous Australians, a forerunner to the petitions for the 1967 referendum. Jollie Smith never married. She remained lifelong friends with both Katharine Susannah Prichard and Nettie Palmer (a friend since PLC days). She died at North Sydney and was cremated with Presbyterian forms.

Tim Holt was originally announced as male lead, intending to be reunited with Anne Shirley from Stella Dallas but this did not eventuate. The male lead was eventually played by James Ellison. John Farrow was assigned to direct and filming began 7 February 1939. Veronica Lake was cast in a small role, her first screen part. This was removed in the edit, but the experience encouraged Lake to pursue acting. Sorority House was a loose reworking of RKO's earlier Finishing School (1934).

This film was later used by the same House committee as evidence of Dalton Trumbo spreading communist propaganda. Trumbo was subsequently blacklisted.

It is located in the heart of Westwood and only a couple of minutes from UCLA. It is currently operated by Regency Theaters under the name Regency Village Theatre. The theater has been one of the leading film premiere theaters in the history of cinema. History Designed by architect Percy Parke Lewis the Fox was originally built in 1930 and first opened on August 14, 1931, with a Spanish Mission style to it. The theatre was part of a widespread cinema construction program undertaken by Fox West Coast Theatres. The Fox Theatre quickly became the most recognizable symbol of the new Westwood Village, a Mediterranean-style village development adjoining the University of California Los Angeles planned by Harold and Edwin Janss of the Janss Investment Company. It was remodeled in the late 1940s to the early 1950s. It became famous for the many Hollywood movie premieres held there and remains one of the main venues for movie premieres in Los Angeles. National General Theatres, the former Fox Theatres-West Coast, sold the theater to Ted Mann, then owner of the Chinese Theatre, and it became part of the Mann Theatres chain. In 1988, the Fox Theatre was designated by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission as an Historic Cultural Monument (HCM #362). When Mann Theatres went out of business, Regency Theatres purchased both the Village Theatre and a multiplex cinema at \\"The Plant\\" in Van Nuys, California in 2010. With ongoing efforts to revitalize Westwood Village, the Fox Theatre continues to be a major drawcard and asset for the area. Architectural features The most striking feature of the Fox Theater is the iconic 170-foot white Spanish Revival/ModerneAn Architectural Guidebook to Los Angeles - David Gebhard, Robert Winter (Gibbs Smith) 2003 tower which looms over the Broxton and Weyburn Avenues intersection. Atop the tower is a blue and white metal Art Deco ‚ÄúFox‚Äù sign, which was renovated in the late 1980s. Carved winged lions sit halfway up the tower at the base of projecting columns. A blue and white sign with the legend \\"Fox Westwood Village\\" is positioned at the bottom of the tower just above the entrance. By night, the elegant white tower literally becomes a beacon with its signs and the shaft of the tower illuminated. The rectangular cinema building immediately behind the tower features long rows of Churrigueresque stucco decorations. Perched atop the corners of the building stand carved griffins. Interior The seating capacity of the cinema is about 1,400. The interior of the theater was remodeled during the late 1940s and early 1950s. The lobby and exits were upgraded and California Gold Rush artwork was added in the lobby. Golden flourishes were added near the stage areas. In the late 1970s new 70mm projection equipment was installed and a larger screen added. The Fox Westwood Village has a reputation for top quality sound and projection. The most recent re-modeling was about 1998-1999 with the theater getting new seating and carpet. In 2014, Regency added the immersive Dolby Atmos sound system to the theater in time for the movie Transcendence. It remains one of the few remaining THX certified theatres in Los Angeles. Movie premieres A number of movie premieres have been held at the cinema, including: The Fast and the Furious, A Star Is Born, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, James Bond films, JFK, Mission: Impossible, Batman, each Harry Potter film, Independence Day, The Terminator, The Emoji Movie, The Lego Movie, Shrek, Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs franchise, Overlord, Venom, Murder Mystery, Hairspray and hundreds of others.

In October 1985, this 1902 resort hotel and its associated buildings was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It operates today as the Portage Point Resort. History The area around Portage Lake was originally settled in the late 1800s during the lumber boom. A water-powered sawmill was constructed at the original outlet of Portage Lake, located a short distance from the inn, in 1845. The adjoining property on Portage Point, where the inn now stands, was purchased in 1869 by Lucius S. Marvin. By 1880, the mill and its associated buildings was moved a few miles away to Onekama. As timberlands were exhausted and lumbering slowed in the 1890s, the potential of the lakeshore for recreational uses began to be exploited. Marvin sold the property on the Point to two associates, and in 1902 they turn they sold the property to a private development corporation, the Sunnyside Assembly. Sunnyside shortly changed their name to Portage Point Assembly, and construction of the Inn was started July 12, 1902. The building was opened for tourists in June 1903. Additional buildings, including a large Main Hotel, the Beech Lodge (Hotel Annex), a Casino / dancing pavilion, and twenty cottages were added during the next ten years. In addition, the channel leading to the complex was dredged, allowing larger steamers to dock directly at the hotel. In 1909, the Northern Michigan Transportation Company, a steamship company, became involved as an investing and operating partner of the Inn, and in 1914 the company took over the management completely. The resort complex continued to expand rapidly. In 1932, the Inn was sold to J.J. Smith, who moved his clientele from the Pine Ridge Resort complex at Hamlin Lake near Ludington, after that resort burned. Smith owned the Inn until his death in 1960. The Inn continued to operate for a number of years, and experienced ups and downs. As of 2017, the resort was purchased by a developer, and rehabilitation plans are in the works. Description The Portage Point Inn Complex is located on Portage Point, a peninsula which separates Lake Michigan from Portage Lake.

The native of Hillsboro, Oregon, stood tall and weighed . He served in the United States Navy in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II and missed three full seasons at the peak of his career. Olsen had considerable success before the war. During his three seasons in minor league baseball (1937‚Äì39), he won 23, 19 and 18 games (losing a total of only 30 contests) before his recall to the Cubs in September 1939. After four scoreless relief appearances in the closing days of the season, Olsen then made the Cubs' 1940 roster and, after more success as a reliever, began taking a regular turn in the Chicago starting rotation in July 1940. On August 22, he threw a complete-game, two-hit shutout against the Brooklyn Dodgers, contributing two hits to the winning cause himself as the Cubs won, 5‚Äì0, at Wrigley Field. He would throw three other shutouts, finishing third in the National League in that category in 1940, post a 13‚Äì9 record, and finish fifth in the league in earned run average (2.97), with nine total complete games. In 1941, Olsen won ten of 18 decisions in 37 games pitched and 23 starting assignments, with ten more complete games and a 3.15 earned run average. His performance declined somewhat in 1942, as he posted a losing record and his ERA climbed to 4.49. He then entered military service, returning for the 1946 season. But he was plagued by a sore arm and was able to appear in only seven more professional games, five with the 1946 Cubs and two more in the minors in 1947. He died in Maywood, Illinois, at the age of 71. During his Major League career, Olsen gave up 547 hits and 192 bases on balls in 516 innings pitched, with 201 strikeouts, 23 complete games, seven shutouts and two saves.

Allodesmus had the specific anatomical features found in modern polygynous pinnipeds: sexual dimorphism, strong canines for fights between bulls and teeth with well-defined growth zones, a result from periodic fasting (in order to defend their harem, males would not take to the sea to feed during the breeding season). Taxonomy Skeleton of Allodesmus at the National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo, Japan. Allodesmus sinanoensis and A. packardi were previously assigned separate genera, Megagomphos and Brachyallodesmus, respectively, but many authors questioned this generic distinction, and the cladistic analysis by Boessenecker and Churchill (2018) found no support for this generic scheme. Atopotarus, referred to Allodesmus by some authors (e.g. Mitchell 1966), is distinct from Allodesmus by the absence of a prenarial shelf and M2, double-rooted cheek teeth, a small, triangular postorbital process, and a mastoid process projecting ventral to the postglenoid process.L.

It was released on PC, Mac and PlayStation Portable on 14 November 2008 in Europe and on 18 November 2008 in North America. As in the case of other recent releases in the Football Manager series, the game is sold as Worldwide Soccer Manager 2009 in the United States and Canada. The demo of the game was released on 2 November via the News of the World, BitTorrent and Steam. An Arsenal-branded version of the game has also been released. Gameplay FM09 features similar gameplay to that of the Football Manager series. Gameplay consists of taking charge of a professional association football team, as the team manager. Players can sign football players to contracts, manage finances for the club, and give team talks to players. FM09 is a simulation of real world management, with the player being judged on various factors by the club's AI owners and board. Some of the new features and box art for the game were announced via a series of videos on 3 September 2008, other new features have been released via a series of podcasts and online blogs. It is the first game in the series to be released on DVD-ROM rather than on CD-ROM. The main new feature to the game is the 3D match engine. This can now be watched fullscreen, with a widescreen option available. Other features include being able to play as a female or male manager, improvements to the interaction between the manager and his assistant manager, improved mid-match team talks and tactics, training players to have preferred moves and transfer rumours. There will also be press conferences, where you can build up a rapport with the journalists, and the finance and transfer systems have been completely reworked. The game is set to feature more players than ever before, with over 350,000 in the database at the time of the game's announcement. The PC version has a skin similar to the one used in Football Manager 2008. The handheld version will include a 2D match engine for the first time, and the game will be shipped with two skins; a light and a dark alternative. The game suffered setbacks on and before launch day, most notably many users found themselves unable to activate the game due to servers providing activation for the DRM system coming under distributed denial of service attacks. Controversy On release, many buyers had problems with the game's copy protection. A printing error on the manuals caused the keys to be difficult to read and there were distributed denial of service attacks on the Uniloc activation servers that prevented purchasers from activating their games. Since the provided telephone activation lines were also run using the activation servers, they were also out of action. In response, SEGA issued a press release apologising for the problems faced by purchasers. As of May 2011, the game can no longer be activated as the website that deals with product activation of Football Manager 2009 has shut down.

While attending his local school he was renamed to Frew by a local priest. Changing Oromo names to Amharic names was extremely common at that time. When he joined the OLF, he changed his name to Dawud Ibasa Ayana. Dawud started his political journey in the 1970's when he took part in the Ethiopian Student Movement. He was a student at the then Haile Selassie I University (now AAU), where he joined the Association of Oromo University Students. He became a member of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) Central Committee in the party‚Äôs earlier days and had to go to prison during the Derg regime from October 1977 to December 1979. Undeterred, Dawud went back to AAU in 1979 to 1980. Before finishing his studies at the department of statistics, in 1981 Dawud fled to the Sudan and joined the OLF armed unit. In April of the same year, using his limited military training he took in present day Eritrea, Dawud went on to command the OLF unit that started the armed struggle in his hometown. Unfortunately, he would soon be poisoned and re-imprisoned by the Derg where he was tortured and kept in the infamous Kerchele prison without charges until December 1986 when he escaped from prison. In 1988, he was reelected to the OLF‚Äôs central and executive committees, eventually becoming the rebel movement‚Äôs Chairman in 1999. Dawud remains OLF‚Äôs Chairman even after some group‚Äôs broke away in 2008, but the core OLF remained with Dawud Ibsa. During his stay in Eritrea, the OLF focused on two main areas of struggle: Firstly, organizing the Oromo youth movement known as Qeerroo Bilisummaa Oromoo in Oromia. This movement forced the EPDRF to crumble and brought Abiy Ahmed to premiership in April 2018. Secondly, the OLF strengthened Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) which is still determinant for political future or charting a roadmap of Oromia/Ethiopia. OLA is now independent from the OLF and formed its own central command structure. It is active in most of the western Oromia including west Shawa, Gujii and Borana regions. Low level activities of OLA are also prevalent in other parts of Oromia regional state. In 2018, a peace deal was signed with the Ethiopian government, thus Dawud returned home leading the main OLF factions to pursue his political ambition. Recently, the National Electoral Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) issued a certificate of registration for OLF paving a way for the party to participate in Ethiopia‚Äôs 2020 general elections.  Education  Ayana attended the Haile Selassie I University in 1970-1971, and participated in the student movement against Haile Selassie. He joined the Association of Oromo University Students. 1974-1976 he participated in the Zemecha campaign. In 1977, Dawud was elected to the OLF Central Committee. From October 1977 to December 1979, he was imprisoned by the Derg. He returned to University during the 1979-1980 academic year. Dawud fled to Sudan in 1980 and joined an OLF unit operating from that country, before finishing his studies in statistics. He received basic military training in Eritrea a few months later. In April 1981, Dawud commanded the OLF unit that started the armed struggle in Welega Province.  Work  The Derg poisoned Ayana in December 1981, and tortured him for several months. He was jailed without charge at Kerchele Prison during the period of August 1982 to December 1986. Dawud escaped from jail and rejoined the OLF. In 1988 he was re-elected to the OLF Central Committee and Executive Committee, and headed the OLF military department until 1991. In 1998, he was re-elected to the OLF Executive committee and became the group's chairman in 1999. Dawud told Les nouvelles d‚ÄôAddis on 29 March 2006 that he was confident that the OLF would form the next government in Ethiopia, a speech which motivated many nationalist Oromo diasporas.

The battery was sited on a cliff overlooking the sea and formed a part of Germany's Atlantic Wall coastal fortifications. It was located between the Allied landing beaches of Gold and Omaha and shelled both beaches on D-Day (6 June 1944). The battery was captured on June 7 and played no further part in the Normandy campaign. The battery is the only one in Normandy to retain all its original guns in situ. It was listed an historical monument in October 2001, and remains in a good state of conservation. Construction The battery is located halfway between Port-en-Bessin in the west and Arromanches-les-Bains in the east and north of Bayeux. Construction of the battery - code-named Widerstandsnest (Wn) 48 - began in September 1943 and was completed by April 1944. Although constructed and manned initially by the Kriegsmarine, the battery was later transferred to the German army in late 1943. Four casemates of regelbau (meaning standard) type M272 requiring 600 square metres of concrete and four tons of steel reinforcement were built each with a 150mm TK C/36 marine gun (manufactured by German-controlled Skoda factory in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia), with a range of approximately and a rate of fire of six to eight shots per minute. The casemates had walls and ceilings over thick. The guns were positioned on a central pivot mount (Mittelpivotlafette - MPL) TL C/36. Behind each gun were rooms containing the shells and charges. Fire control was managed from a regelbau type M262A two-story command post located in front of the guns on the cliff edge. It was equipped some of the most technically advanced firing control systems available in Normandy. It communicated with each gun battery via an armoured electrical communication system. Also situated at the battery were ammunition bunkers and shelters for defending troops. Three 20 mm anti- aircraft guns were placed at the battery with a searchlight. Around the battery was a minefield, barbed wire fences and machine-gun and mortar pits for defence. A Soviet 122 mm K390 cannon was also placed in an open gun pit close to the entrance to the battery. Garrison The battery had a garrison of 184 officers and men, under initial Kriegsmarine command were later transferred to the Heer. Normandy landings Plan of Longues-sur-Mer gun battery, Normandy The battery at Longues-sur-Mer was situated between the landing beaches Omaha and Gold. In the build up to D-Day, the battery was attacked by aircraft on several occasions. On the evening of 5/6 June 1944 the battery was attacked by bombers, little damage was inflicted on the casemates, but bombs severed the armoured communication system. A large amount of the bombs dropped hit a nearby village. The fire control post reverted to visual signals to control some of the guns and this affected their accuracy. The bombing was followed from 05:37 on the morning of the landings by bombardment from the British cruiser HMS Ajax. The battery itself opened fire at 06:05, and at 06.20 targeted the headquarters ship for Gold Beach, HMS Bulolo, which retreated out of range. At 08.00 the British cruisers Ajax and Argonaut engaged the battery. By 08.45 no shots were fired by the battery's guns for a time as the Germans undertook repairs. The heaviest damage was caused by the explosion of the ammunition for an AA gun, mounted by the Germans on the roof of casemate No.4, which killed several German soldiers. After effecting repairs the battery's guns once again opened fire towards Omaha Beach. The French cruisers Georges Leygues and Montcalm, assisted by the WW I vintage dreadnought USS Arkansas returned fire on the battery. The return fire knocked out one casemate and damaged two others. The still active fourth gun opened fire intermittently during the afternoon and evening of D-Day but caused little impact on the Allied landings. The battery had fired over 100 shots through the day. The crew of the battery (184 men, half of them over 40 years old) surrendered without a fight to advancing British troops of C Company of the 2nd Devonshire Regiment at midday on June 7. Advanced Landing Ground B-11 Close to the Longues-sur-Mer battery a temporary Advanced Landing Ground (code-named B-11) airstrip was built by the Allies. The airstrip was active between June 21 to September 4, 1944 and used by the 125th Wing of the No. 83 Expeditionary Air Group flying Spitfires, and by the French air ace Pierre Clostermann.

Coal gases are made by decomposing coal through heating it to a high temperature. Coal gases were the primary source of gas fuel during the 1940s and 1950s until the adoption of natural gas. They were used for lighting, heating, and cooking, typically being supplied to households through pipe distribution systems. The gas was named after its discoverer, Ludwig Mond.  Discovery  In 1889, Ludwig Mond discovered that the combustion of coal with air and steam produced ammonia along with an extra gas, which was named the Mond gas. He discovered this while looking for a process to form ammonium sulfate, which was useful in agriculture. The process involved reacting low quality coal with superheated steam, which produced the Mond gas. The gas was then passed through dilute sulfuric acid spray, which ultimately removed the ammonia, forming ammonium sulfate. Mond modified the gasification process by restricting the air supply and filling the air with steam, providing a low working temperature. This temperature was below ammonia's point of dissociation, maximizing the amount of ammonia that could be produced from the nitrogen, a product from superheating coal.  Gas production  The Mond gas process was designed to convert cheap coal into flammable gas, which was made up of mainly hydrogen, while recovering ammonium sulfate. The gas produced was rich in hydrogen and poor in carbon monoxide. Although it could be used for some industrial purposes and power generation, the gas was limited for heating or lighting. In 1902, the first Mond gas plant began at the Brunner Mond & Company in Northwich, Cheshire. Mond plants required a large amount of land in order to be profitable, using around 182 tons of coal per week.  Reaction  Predominant reaction in Mond Gas Process: C + 2H2O = CO2+ 2H2 The Mond gas was composed of roughly: * 12% CO (Carbon monoxide) * 28% H2 (Hydrogen) * 2.2% CH4 (Methane) * 16% CO2 (Carbon dioxide) * 42% N2 (Nitrogen)  Uses  Mond gas could be produced and used more efficiently than other gases in the late 19th and early 20th century. The gas was used as fuel for street lighting and basic residential uses that required gas such as ovens, kilns, furnaces, and boilers.  Advantages  The Mond gas could be produced very cheaply since it required only a low quality coal, offering large savings for many processes. The production of Mond gas did not require a lot of labor. The Mond gas became popularized during the industrial power generation in the beginning of the 20th century, since industries were very interested in a source of low cost energy. The Mond gas provided a boost to the gas engine industry in particular. For example, a large gas engine that used Mond gas was 5-6 times more efficient than a standard steam engine. This is primarily because Mond gas was produced from the lowest cost coal rather than steam coal, resulting in cheaper electricity at about 1/20th of the normal price.  Modern use  The Mond gas was used primarily during the early 20th century, and its process was further developed by the Power Gas Corporation as the Lymn system; however, the gas has been widely forgotten. The use of coal gases has become far less popular due to the adoption of natural gas in the 1960s. Natural gases were better for the environment because they burned more cleanly than other fuels such as coal and oil and could also be transported more safely and efficiently over sea.

It is found throughout the temperate belt of Eurasia from Europe through Kazakhstan and southern Siberia to Amur Region, China, Korea and Japan. In China several sibling species occur. Caterpillar 200px John Curtis's British Entomology Volume 5 The wingspan is 34‚Äì48 mm. Wing pattern is very variable, from entirely white wings to strongly covered with black dots. Hindwings often with one or several black dots (rarely without any black dot). Antennae branches long (much longer than in similar Spilosoma urticae), 3‚Äì5 times longer than the antenna stem diameter. Technical description and variation Milky white, abdomen orange with black dorsal dots. Forewing more or less sprinkled with sharply defined black dots, of which there are always some at the costa and others arranged in rows in the disc. Hindwing with discal dots and often with anal ones and others. Antennae black. In specimens from northern Scotland the forewing is sandy yellow, ab. ochrea, also found elsewhere as an exception among. The forewing may be darkened to brown; this is the case in ab. brunnea Ober. In ab. luxerii Godt. the forewing is suffused with rose-red distally and brownish proximally. In ab. walkeri Curt, the dots merge to form radial streaks. In Japan it usually occurs in the form sangaica Walk. which is only distinguished from lubricipeda by the sparse dots, especially in the outer area of the forewing. Specimens similar to sangaica occur aberratively also in Europe, bearing the name paucipuncta Fuchs and in contradistinction to it there is the very strongly dotted krieghoffi Pabst. A still further reduction of the dots leads to ab. unipuncta Strand, in which there is only one dot on the hindwing. -punctarium Cr.

The number of appearances of each characters is that from the original Franco-Belgian publications. Spelling and affiliation are from those titles as released in English, where applicable. Otherwise, the spelling and affiliation are adhered to as featured in the original French-language publications. Heroes Michael Steven Donovan, born on 30 October 1843 near Augusta, Georgia, is the main character of the eponymous series.\\"Mike Steve Donovan\\" in the original publication. Date and place of birth as provided by co-creator Charlier in his fictional Blueberry biography included in the 1974 book Ballade pour un cercueil. Donovan is the son of a rich Southern farmer and starts out as a dedicated racist. After being framed for the murder, he did not commit, of plantation owner Tucker, the father of his fianc√©e Harriet, he flees and is saved by the escaped African-American slave Long Sam, who pays with his life for his act of altruism. He becomes an enemy of discrimination of all kinds, fighting against the Confederates (although being a Southerner himself), and trying to protect the rights of Native Americans. He chooses the surname \\"Blueberry\\" as alias when fleeing from his Southern enemies (inspired when he looks at a blueberry bush), starting with his adventures as a lieutenant in the United States Cavalry shortly after the American Civil War.In volume 5 of the Franco-Belgian Western comic series Les Gringos (created by Charlier and Victor de la Fuente), \\"Viva Nez Cass√©\\" (48 pages, Paris:Dargaud, 1995/01, ), Blueberry makes a very prominent crossover appearance as himself as a military advisor to Pancho Villa during the Mexican revolution of the 1910s, as established by Charlier in his Blueberry biography. In the story Blueberry meets up with Chini's granddaughter Isabel, who also plays a significant role in the story, and it is through her that Blueberry shortly reunites with Chini one last time, before she dies, after having been mortally wounded by her abusive second husband Roberto. Chini's first husband Vittorio incidentally, is in the story established as having undergone the exact same historically correct fate his historical counterpart had, implying that both characters had always been one and the same. Jimmy McClure is an old gold prospector but he is above all a great drinker. Blueberry was advised by General Crook to ask him for some information about Indians because he was known as a specialist in the matter. Blueberry's best friend, he helped him in several of his adventures, often saving him, but also causing some unexpected problems, not rarely because of his fondness for the bottle. However, in the final part of Blueberry's life, at Tombstone, he did not appear at all. (appears in 17 albums) \\"Red Neck\\",Additionally given the surname \\"Wooley\\" in a reprint of the original publication as an expert about Indians matters, was sent by General Dodge to Fort-Navajo to meet Lieutenant Blueberry. From then, he helped him in some of his missions. Though much more introverted and lonesome than McClure, he is a faithful friend to Blueberry. (appears in 11 albums) Recurring characters, friends and foes General \\"Golden Mane\\" Allister, determined to exterminate the Cheyenne and Sioux tribes, was sent by Washington to subjugate Indians in 1867. He could not prevent the peace from being signed. Later, he tried to assassinate President Grant. He was killed by Blueberry after making a last attempt on Grant's life. (appears in 3 albums) Wally Blount, with his mate and partner \\"Crazy\\" Cole Timbley, was a smart serial killer. Searching for the golden mine of the Superstition Mountains, he chased Prosit Luckner and forced him to lead him to the mine, but he was killed by a snake put by Prosit in his boot. (appears in 2 albums) Captain Finley is a former Confederate officer. Instead of surrendering, after having deserted the Confederate forces, he fled to Mexico where he looted with his band, made out of members of his former command. In 1866, he helped Blueberry destroy a Mexican convoy of arms destined for the Apaches, contributing to establish peace again. In 1869, searching for the Confederate treasury, he became Blueberry's rival but was killed. Finlay was actually killed by his staunch compatriot, former Confederate sergeant Kimball, after the latter found out that Finlay, who wanted to continue his deprivations, had withheld from his men the pardon the band had received from President Grant in recognition of the help they had provided Blueberry earlier in Mexico, denying him and the others the opportunity to return to their families in the former Confederacy years previously. All of Finlay's men perished in his relentless pursuit for the gold. (appears in 5 albums) Chihuahua Pearl is a former chorus girl. She was wooed by Lopez, a Mexican prison governor, and was ostentatiously ready to marry him for money. However, she had been more interested in the treasury of the Confederates, having actually already married its keeper, former Confederate colonel Trevor, as a ploy to pry the location out of him, something she never succeeded in. When she resumed the hunt for the hidden cache, she became occasionally allied with Blueberry. Despite the adversary nature of their relationship there was a sexual tension between the two as observed by his friend Red Neck, and served as the rationale for why she afterwards agreed to become party in a plot to free Blueberry from US Army imprisonment. Blueberry later fell in love with her but did not succeed in marrying her, despite a spectacular abduction from a church, she instead opting to marry the initially left at the altar Duke Stanton after all. Stanton, a wealthy railroad baron, exceedingly jealous but unaware of her checkered past, knows her as Lily Caloway only. (appears in 6 albums) Chini is Cochise's daughter. Vittorio and Blueberry vied in a hard competition for her affections, the former in order to succeed Cochise. It actually was Blueberry's ill-conceived attempt to impress Chini, when he and several Navajo friends ambushed a stage coach carrying \\"Wild Bill\\" Hickok, that alerted US authorities to the fact that the alleged would-be assassin of President Grant was still alive, causing the hunt for the former lieutenant to resume, eventually endangering Cochise's tribe as well. Chini once met Chihuahua Pearl in person and exhibited jealousy, as she sensed the attraction between her and Blueberry. She was previously critically wounded by scalp hunter Gideon \\"Eggskull\\" O'Bannon when she tried to help Blueberry escape from him, but survived her wounds with the help from a US Army surgeon. She played an important role during the escape of her tribe to Mexico in the winter of 1871/1872, and eventually threw in her lot with Vittorio. (appears in 3 albums) Colonel Clark is Blueberry's commanding officer at Fort Navajo. A gruff no-nonsense career officer he is the successor of Blueberry's previous commanding officer at the fort, Colonel Dixon, who had died pursuant being bitten by a rattle snake. Often aghast at his subordinate's unruly nature, he is only too happy to send him on detached missions, whenever he is able to. Nevertheless, he - though he will never admit to the fact - is fond of Blueberry and has a begrudging respect for his undeniable abilities and the loyalty he commands from the men under his command, and vainly tries to defend him when Blueberry is booted out of the army on trumped up charges. What Clark does not realize however, is that he is intentionally kept out of the loop by his superiors, as it is all an elaborate scheme to send Blueberry on a classified mission. Starting out as a major, he was promoted to colonel during his tenure as the fort's commander (appears in 4 albumsBlueberry's commanding officer has remained nameless in the main series. It was not until 1991 when he was finally given his name in \\"Sur ordre de Washington\\" (48 pages, Paris:Alpen Publishers, 1991/11, ), the first title in the Marshal Blueberry spin-off series.) Cochise is the chief of the Navajo tribe. In 1866/67, he waged war against the American army after it imprisoned several Indian chiefs. Trusting Blueberry who urged him to sign peace, he finally accepted it. In 1870, he adopted Blueberry, wanted as an outlaw, into his tribe. He died in 1872 before his tribe had reached the safety of Mexican territory. (appears in 5 albums) Lieutenant Crowe is a cavalry officer in the US Army at Fort Navajo. Of Native-American descent, he is hated by Major Bascom. He deserted from the army during the war against the Navajos in 1866, setting free several imprisoned Navajo chiefs previously captured by Bascom. He then helped Blueberry achieve peace with Cochise for which he was killed by Lone Eagle. (appears in 4 albums) Jethro \\"Steelfinger\\" Diamond is an outlaw. His nickname came from the steel hand he used after his real hand was cut off by Indians. He was hired by the Central Pacific railroad to block Union Pacific's advance. He slaughtered bison with his band and blamed this crime on Union Pacific members to trigger a war with the Indians. He succeeded in making the Sioux and Cheyennes wage war against whites in 1868. After peace was achieved, he was finally killed by Sitting Bull in a duel. (appears in 3 albums) General Dodge has always been a strong supporter and sponsor of Blueberry, ever since Blueberry had helped him escape Confederate imprisonment after the Battle of Chickamauga. Erroneously believing at first that Blueberry had betrayed him, it was Dodge who caused Blueberry's trademark facial feature, his broken nose. Later, Dodge notably helped in his rehabilitation on two occasions, the first time during the war, additionally arranging for Blueberry to become a commissioned officer, and the second time after the plot to assassinate President Grant. In between, he had entrusted his prot√©g√© with the mission of avoiding a war with Indians in 1868 at a time when he headed the Union Pacific Railroad. (appears in 6 albums) Lieutenant Graig is the son of General Graig. Inexperienced, he was caught by Indians during the first Navajo war and then set free by Blueberry. He then helped Blueberry achieve peace by defending and supporting him. At one point Craig is captured by the Navajos and nearly tortured to death, before being saved by Blueberry. (appears in 4 albums) \\"Wild Bill\\" Hickok is a hunter, army scout and bounty hunter. After having been ambushed by Blueberry and Navajos, Hickock teams up with the ruthless scalp hunter Gideon \\"Eggskull\\" O'Bannon to hunt down Blueberry, who had later managed to escape US Army custody, and the Navajos of Cochise. Foiled by Blueberry on virtually every turn, Hickock barely makes it out with his life, when the Navajos make their final dash into Mexico, unlike Eggskull (having already critically wounded Chini previously) who is trampled to death. (appears in 3 albums) Lone Eagle aka Quanah, a cruel Indian determined to defeat the whites, he did his best to urge the Navajos to wage war in 1866. He succeeded in being hired as scout by the US Army, which had put him in a position to spy on, and sabotage the efforts of, the army. One of Blueberry's greatest enemies, he killed Crowe, an American officer of Indian origin and Mike's friend, and promised to also kill Blueberry. The latter finally defeated and killed him in a memorable duel, in the process avenging the death of his friend Crowe. (appears in 3 albums) Governor Lopez gets on the competing side of Blueberry trying to find the confederate gold treasure, hidden by Trevor in Mexico. An egotistical and brutal man, Lopez would stop at nothing, including wrongful incarceration and torture, to retrieve the treasure. After Blueberry escapes, Lopez finally meets his match attempting to catch Blueberry's gang at the other end of a bridge that Blueberry already prepared with explosives. As Chihuahua state governor, Lopez was succeeded by Commandante Vigo. (appears in 3 albums) \\"Prosit\\" Luckner is a Dutch prospector who believes in the existence of a golden mine in the Superstition Mountains. He finally found the mine but Blueberry prevented him profiting from it and sent him in jail. He achieved his aim by killing many of his partners. Actually, Luckner was the name of his former employer, he thought he had also killed. Having survived against all odds, the real Luckner, an impoverished Dutch noble man, revealed that the name of his former man servant was Gustaaf Havel. (appears in 2 albumsIn the English translations both men originated from the Netherlands, however in the original publications they were Prussian as specifically intended as the story was a take on the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine legend, called L√ºckner and Gustav Hazel respectively. Translator Jean- Marc Lofficier used the legend as coined for the title of the English book release, and took the moniker \\"Dutch\\" as currently understood - as in from/of the Netherlands - literally. However, being of French descent, Lofficier had not realized that in the United States of the mid-to-late 19th century, \\"Dutch\\" had a different meaning, as it was by Americans employed to refer to people of German descent/origin, due to the massive influx of German immigrants in that period of time. These immigrants referred to themselves as \\"Deutsch\\" in their own language, and the phonetic similarity is the most commonly accepted rationale for the phenomenon.) Dor√©e Malone is a singer and dancer employed in a saloon in the town of Tombstone, Arizona. Aside from her profession, she is a formidable poker player and frequently engages Blueberry, with whom she entertains a friendly relationship, in poker marathons. It is Malone who nurses Blueberry back to health, after the latter was gunned down by a misguided youth in 1881. In return, Blueberry later saves Malone in the nick of time from being murdered by the delusional gunslinger Johnny Ringo. (appears in 5 albums) Lieutenant Lewis \\"Billy\\" Norton is an officer in the Confederate army. Norton and Donovan used to be childhood friends in Georgia, but became alienated from each other after Harriet Tucker, whose affections Norton likewise vied for, decided to become betrothed to Donovan. By chance the paths of the former friends crossed each other during the war, and once on the scent of Donovan, Norton pursued him with a near obsessive vigor. Though Norton, believing Donovan to be a traitor, purported to do so because of Southern honor, he also intimated a personal motive - Harriet's snubbing of him in favor of Donovan - for his relentless quest for vengeance. After an intense locomotive chase, both men fell into the hands of the Union army, but Norton managed to get his pound of flesh by implicating Donovan as a double agent, which was believed by their Union captors. (appears in 2 albumsJust \\"Lewis Norton\\" in the original publication; Norton resurfaced in volume 8 of Young Blueberry spin-off series, the by Colin Wilson penciled \\"Trois hommes pour Atlanta\\" (48 pages, Paris:Alpen Publishers, 1993/06, ), as a captain in the city of Atlanta, presumably as a result from a prisoner exchange, just prior to the battles for that city. Norton again manages to capture Blueberry, who is on a secret mission in the city, but, after being wounded, mellows somewhat as he allows his old childhood friend to escape.) Marmaduke \\"Angel Face\\" O'Hare\\"Marmaduke O'Saughtnessy\\" in the original publication is a serial killer and young handsome man hired to assassinate President Grant. Blueberry mutilated much of his face by putting it in the fire pit of a train. Angel Face then promised to do the same to him. He was finally killed by Blueberry in an intense duel. (appears in 3 albums) Guffie Palmer is an actress and the manager of the most famous American theater troupe in the late 1860s. Jethro Steelfinger robbed her of her money in 1858 after he had promised her they would get married. Blueberry saved her from the Indians during the war in 1868. In 1869, they met again, when Guffie saved Mike near the Superstition Mountains in the desert. In 1870, Blueberry sought refuge at Santa Fe where she were living. Unbeknownst to Blueberry, Guffie is unwilling part of a band of criminals who are in league with the would-be assassins of President Grant, and was pressured to lure in Blueberry as the intended patsy for the assassination. After escaping the band, she succeeded in saving the president, who once had been her lover, but lost her life at the same time. (appears in 4 albums) Colonel Trevor is a former Confederate cavalry officer. Charged by Confederate President Jefferson Davis at war's end to hide the war treasury for future use, Trevor did so when he hid the treasury in Mexico. He went above and beyond the call of duty, when he was imprisoned in Governor Lopez' brutal labor camp, while protecting the hoard. When he was inebriated on a previous occasion, Trevor had actually married Chihuahua Pearl, who had her own agenda, but once sobered up, that fact was not lost on Trevor. After being freed from imprisonment with the assistance of Blueberry, Trevor was murdered in a fluke occurrence while defending the treasury against the marauders of Finlay, whom he actually had condemned to death for desertion during the war. As a fellow officer, Blueberry expressed admiration and respect for Trevor's sense of duty and honor, when he discovered and buried his body, even though their interests had been opposed, and actually slapped Chihuahua Pearl when she spoke derogatorily of Trevor at the burial. Loyal to a fault, actually willing to let himself be gunned down by an irate Finlay before Blueberry intervened, Trevor's sacrifices turned out to be in vain, as the Mexicans had years earlier already absconded with the treasury. (appears in 2 albums) Harriet Tucker is the daughter and only, somewhat doted upon, child of wealthy Georgia plantation owner Tucker. Stunningly beautiful, Harriet has had her share of suitors, which included Mike Donovan, her cousin Ronnie and Lewis Norton. Harriet decided to become betrothed to Mike, much against the wishes of her father who considered Mike a rambunctious loudmouth and much preferred Harriet to have chosen Ronnie. Harriet's carefree and somewhat naive existence as a \\"Southern belle\\" came to an abrupt end when her home was burned to the ground and her father murdered, acts she believed were perpetrated by her fianc√©. However, a grief-stricken Harriet had not realized that the heinous acts were actually perpetrated by Ronnie and who had successfully framed Mike for them. In doing so, Ronnie had killed three birds with one stone; he got rid of a rival in love, destroyed evidence of his fraudulent managing of Tucker's estate, as well as standing to inherit said estate. After Ronnie was killed by Mike, Harriet spent much of the next two years and her inheritance in her quest for vengeance for the murder of her father by assembling a band of mercenaries and actively searching for her ex-lover. But when she and her band finally picked up on the trail of Mike, she had to act quickly, as he was slated to be executed by the Union army for alleged treason. In a spectacular fashion, she and her men managed to save Mike, but was herself mortally wounded during the escape. As she lay dying, it was only then that she admitted to her former lover, that she had saved him not for love, but only to be able to kill him herself. Unable to save her, Mike swore on the love they once had, that he was innocent, and with her dying breath, Harriet chose to believe him, as \\"(...)otherwise, dyin'd be too hard\\". (appears in 2 albums) Vigo is a Mexican commandante. He was ordered by his government to find out the treasure hidden in Mexico by Trevor at the end of the Civil War, which he actually did, thereby negating all the sacrifices Trevor, who never knew that the hiding place had been compromised, had made in order to protect the cache. Then he was searched for by Blueberry because he was the only man who could prove his innocence. Committed suicide after contracting gangrene from a knife wound in the back. Vigo was initially a loyal soldier to President Benito Ju√°rez, and was therefore unwilling to admit before a US Army board of inquiry that the Mexican government had spent the Confederate treasury to fund their uprising against Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico and his French occupation forces, which however left Blueberry a suspect of theft. By the time Blueberry found him out, Vigo, now the Chihuahua state governor - appointed as such by a grateful Ju√°rez in recognition of his services to the country and thereby filling the position left vacant by his deceased predecessor Lopez - , had become corrupted and had scrupulously engaged in acts of self enrichment. Yet, the dying Vigo, after he had fallen out of favor with Ju√°rez' successor Porfirio D√≠az, left the proceeds of these to Blueberry as an act of contrition. It was this money that made Blueberry and his two faithful compatriots wealthy men, though he himself was embezzled out of his fortune in 1881. (appears in 4 albums) Non-fictional characters As a realistic comics series, set against a historical background, Blueberry feature many real-life characters who left their mark on the History of United States. Among them are George Nicholas Bascom, Cochise, General Crook, General Dodge, Sitting Bull, \\"Wild Bill\\" Hickok, President Grant, the Earp brothers, Johnny Ringo and Geronimo. Aside from the actual historical characters, several fictional character were clearly patterned after historical counterparts. These included most obviously, General \\"Golden Mane\\" Allister (after General/Colonel George Armstrong Custer, sharing a similar moniker, besides his disposition and appearance), Chihuahua Pearl (after 19th century British/American stage actress Lily Langtry, sharing her beauty, predisposition for seeking out wealthy men, profession and her prenom as alias) and Vittorio (after Apache chief Victorio, sharing his countenance and a very similar name). Less obvious was the fiercely independent Chini, a take on Apache female warrior(s) Dahteste and/or Gouyen.The most famous Apache female warrior, Lozen, was concurrently a powerful prophet and, incidentally, a sister of Victorio. The scalp hunter Gideon \\"Eggskull\\" O'Bannon, so called because he had survived a scalping, which however had left the top of his skull exposed, is also grounded in fact, as two historical 19th century counterparts were known to have shared a similar fate, Josiah P. Wilbarger and Robert McGee. Even the highly unusual inclusion - considering the racist attitudes of the organization at the time - of the Native-American Crowe in the officer ranks of the regular US Army is not without historical precedent, as a respected full-blooded Native-American, Ely S. Parker, had served as volunteer with distinction in the Civil War on the staff of Ulysses Grant, in the process rising to the rank of general, and gaining a formal officer's commission in the regular army after the war. Movie inspired characters :note: in order of first appearance in the original French publications. In his youth, Blueberry artist Giraud had been a passionate fan of American Westerns, and as a result has over the years paid homage by giving several of his (mostly background) characters the appearances and/or trade marks of actors who had performed in them, usually in fleeting background cameos. Recurrent characters Giraud had given the treatment, included, *Blueberry: In the first outings of the series, the main character was given the face of French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo. While not a Western actor this was intentional as the creators wanted to capitalize on the huge popularity Belmondo enjoyed at the time in France.de Bree, 1982, p. 13 *Cochise: In the first Navajo story cycle, Cochise is given the demeanor and appearance of American actor Jeff Chandler who played the same role in the 1950 western Broken Arrow, reprising the role in the 1952 western The Battle at Apache Pass. Incidentally, no historical depiction of Cochise is known to exist.de Bree, 1982, p. 31 *Jimmy McClure: Considering the very similar roles all three characters had in their respective mediums, it does not come as a surprise that Giraud modeled his character, both in appearance as well as in behaviour, after an amalgam of American actors Walter Brennan and George \\"Gabby\\" Hayes, who were renowned for their skills in playing the sidekick of the protagonist or the \\"grumpy old man\\" in the Westerns of the 1940s -1960s era, particularly those of John Ford and Howard Hawks. While Giraud had imagined his character to have white hair, in concordance with the appearances of the screen actors, it was the colorist who took the initiative of giving McClure red hair, which however pleased Giraud, as it made his character his distinct own.Sadoul, 1991, p. 158 Jimmy McClure's most Brennan/Hayes inspired performance was in the one-shot title \\"The Man with the Silver Star\\" (48 pages, New York City:Dargaud International, 1983/Q2, ), itself heavily inspired by Hawk's 1959 Western Rio Bravo, in which Brennan played a prominent role as such. Incidentally, Charlier had originally written McClure as a temporary, minor background character, but Giraud was so taken with the character that he asked Charlier to expand his role in the comic series.de Bree, 1982, p. 41 *Captain Finlay: In his first appearances Finlay is given the face, hairdo, rank, uniform and allegiance, of actor Richard Harris who had played the virtually identical role of Captain Benjamin Tyreen in the 1965 western Major Dundee, released shortly before Finlay made his entrance in the serialized magazine publication of the comic. *Guffie Palmer: In her first appearance, Palmer is given the face, clothing, profession and outfit of actress Shelley Winters who played an identical role in the 1968 western The Scalphunters, likewise released shortly before Palmer made her first appearance in the comic. *Wally Blount: This character was given the facial traits and hairdo of American actor Spencer Tracy, not based on any particular role. Giraud gave Blount's partner \\"Crazy\\" Cole Timbley the facial traits of British actor Terence Stamp.Svane, 2003, p. 42 *Chihuahua Pearl: In her first appearance as showgirl, Pearl is given exactly the same outfit, resemblance and cheek mole of actress Jayne Mansfield, playing a similar role in the 1958 western The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw. *Dor√©e Malone: In his youth Giraud had been infatuated with American actress Dorothy Malone, and it was her name he had given his character, though not her appearance.Svane, 2003, p. 31 Notes Sources Web Sources *https://web.archive.org/web/20080915102821/http://www.blueberry-lesite.com/ *http://www.domainegorn.com/series/blueberry.html *http://enciclopediavisualblueberry.blogspot.nl/2010/11/characters-menu-click- on-names-to-get.html Blueberry Blueberry ","title":"List of Blueberry characters"},{"id":"19104325","text":"Heber Edgar Smith (8 August 1915 ‚Äì 25 October 1990) was a Progressive Conservative party member of the House of Commons of Canada.

Occasionally found in other regions of Russia, modern Tatar religious architecture was developed in the late 18th century and gained popularity in the 19th century Idel-Ural.  History  The earliest examples of Islamic Tatar architecture are located in Bolghar; none of them are in use today. They reflect strong similarities to Central Asian Islamic architecture from which the designs were derived. However, it is believed that design of rural mosques, opposing to Central Asian-like mosques of capital cities, evolve from their ability to withstand the harsh local climate. Many mosques, both stone and wooden were built, according to this style. The oldest of the still active modern Tatar mosques is the M√§rcani mosque in the Tatar capital of Kazan. Dating from the reign of Catherine the Great, the mosque's minaret is placed in the center of a gabled roof. It is believed that the concept was adopted from traditional rural Tatar mosques. The M√§rcani mosque is an example of revival Tatar religious architecture as most mosques were destroyed due to the Christianization edict of 1742. Unification The edict on unification of church buildings of 1817 was expanded to the mosques in 1831, when the exemplary project was developed and circulated to governorate architectural offices of Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, Perm and Simbirsk Governorates. Tatar mosques, such as M√§rcani and Apanay were built in Baroque style. ƒ∞ske Ta≈ü and Pink Mosques were contributed to classicism style. Among the architects, contributed to the mosques building in the 19th century the most notable were Pyatnitsky, Korinfsky, Schmidt, Peske, Romanov, Yermolayev, Pavlov, Parensov, Petondi, Tekhomirov, as well as non- professional architects Mansurov, Foshderebryuggen, Jakobson. In 1844 another exemplary mosque project was introduced, which was used mostly for urban mosques. The minaret was placed at the northern part of the building, under the door. However, mosques with minarets on the roof are constructed till today. Gallery Image:Marcani Minaret.jpgM√§rcani Mosque.

She is one of few people to have been executed for witchcraft in Bermuda. Gardiner was the wife of one Ralph Gardiner, and was put on trial by Capt'n Josias Fforster, Governor, accused of having affected a woman with magic; she had threatened she would cramp Tomasin, a mulatto woman, who was later struck blind and dumb for 2 hours. Another woman, Anne Bowen, was tried with her. Gardiner pleaded not guilty. A jury of women was appointed to search her body: Mrs Ellen Burrowes, Mrs Fflora Wood, Mrs Eliz. Stowe, Allice Sparkes, Eliz. Brangman. She was then subjected to the ordeal of water, and after being thrown twice in the sea..she floated like a corke and could not sink, she was judged guilty of witchcraft and sentenced to death. She was executed on Monday 26 May 1651. The fate of Anne Bowen is unknown. In the period of 1651-1696, 22 witch trials were held on Bermuda to 18 women and four men, of which five women and one man was executed.

The film is based on the 1977 novel of the same name by Hermann Kant, which was based on Kant's own experience as a prisoner of war in Poland. The film tells the story of a German prisoner of war at the end of World War II who is wrongly accused of being a war criminal. The film was controversial upon release as Polish commentators criticized that the film showed the Polish army wrongly accusing someone of war crimes. Nevertheless, the film was successful and won several awards and was the East German official submission to the 56th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film. Plot In October 1945 the 19-year-old German prisoner of war, Mark Niebuhr (Sylvester Groth) arrives together with other prisoners at a train station in Warsaw. A Polish woman waiting for her train at the station believes that he is the SS officer who murdered her daughter during a raid in Lublin. He is removed from the other prisoners and incarcerated in a single prison cell. Again and again he is interrogated by a Polish officer who is asking him to write down his life story and to tell his real name. The young former soldier asserts that he is Mark Niebuhr and maintains his innocence, not knowing why he has been detained and not understanding why he is being questioned. After four months of solitary confinement he is transferred to a new prison cell he is sharing with Polish criminals. As a German he is subject to their hatred and is regularly harassed. He is also assigned the most dangerous works, having to remove stones from bombed houses in Warsaw. During one of his assignment he saves a child, but breaks his arm. He is transferred to a hospital where he learns that he is charged with murder. After his hospital stay he is transferred to a new prison, where he has to share a cell with German prisoners of war. The German prisoners maintain strict military order according to their former ranks. They are led by General Eisensteck (Fred D√ºren) and Major Lundenbroich (Klaus Piontek) who still cling to fascist ideals. Little by little Niebuhr gets to know his fellow prisoners. Although everyone is maintaining his innocence, Niebuhr slowly realizes that they are murderers and war criminals. He begins to distance himself from his fellow prisoners and realizes his guilt as an ordinary German soldier. While his cell mates are one by one executed, the Polish authorities ultimately believe Niebuhr and release him.

Retrieved 6 July 2018 The film was widely praised by the East German press, with Neues Deutschland declaring the film \\"a testament to the friendship between the People's Republic of Poland and East Germany\\". The Polish reaction was very negative and the depiction of the Polish army wrongly accusing a German of war crimes was perceived as anti-Polish. Both the Polish actors in the film and Polish representatives boycotted the premiere of the film. The controversy also resulted in a withdrawal of the film from the Berlin International Film Festival, where it was originally planned to be screened and was expected to successfully compete for the awards. Despite the controversy the film became the top-grossing film of 1983 in East Germany and was released in West Germany to mixed reviews in spring 1984. Awards and honors Frank Beyer (left) receives the Heinrich-Greif-Preis. Director Frank Beyer, screenwriter Wolfgang Kohlhaase and the main actor Sylvester Groth were awarded the Heinrich-Greif-Preis in 1984.

Graduating from the Sea Cadet Corps in 1874 Grigorovich served as an officer on various ships. In 1893, he was promoted to captain, 1st rank. In 1896 to 1898 he was appointed Russian naval attach√© in London. In 1899 he was appointed to command the battleship , which was being completed in France. In 1903 Tsesarevich sailed to Port Arthur.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 134-135. During the surprise Japanese torpedo boat attack on Port Arthur, starting the Russo-Japanese War, Tsesarevich was hit by a Japanese torpedo but remained afloat and contributed to driving off the Japanese attack. Grigorovich was awarded the Order of St Vladimir, 3rd class with swords for his role in the battle. After the death of Admiral Stepan Makarov, he was promoted to rear admiral and appointed chief of Port Arthur's port. Under his effective management, Russian Pacific squadron had no shortage of coal, munitions or any supplies during the Siege of Port Arthur. In 1904 he was also awarded with the Order of Saint Stanislaus, 1st class. As admiral After the end of the war Grigorovich was appointed chief of staff of the Black Sea Fleet. He was appointed commander of the naval base at Libau in 1908 awarded the Order of St Anna, 1st class, and became commander of the naval base at Kronstadt in 1909. In 1909 he was appointed Deputy Navy Minister and promoted to admiral in 1911. From 1911 until the onset of revolution in 1917 he served as Russia's Naval Minister, overseeing a huge rearmament programme. The naval build-up included building four Gangut-class battleships for the Baltic Fleet and four Imperatritsa Mariya-class battleships for the Black Sea Fleet. He personally visited the shipyards and the different fleets of Imperial Russia to supervise the progress of the construction of warships, training of crew and sailors. He enjoyed good relationships with the Duma and used his popularity to secure huge extra funds to expand the navy. He remained in charge of the Imperial Russian Navy through most of World War I. He was chairman of the Admiralty Board from 1911 to 1915, and was a member of the State Council from 1913 to 1917. Grigorovich was politically sympathetic to the Octobrist Party and was nominated as a candidate for Prime Minister in 1916; however his candidacy was rejected due to objections from dowager tsarina Maria Feodorovna over Grigorovich's liberal views. Post-Revolution Grigorovich was dismissed from office in the wake of the February Revolution on 31 March 1917. He served on the Historical Commission and was asked to write his memoirs (which were only published in 1993, after the fall of the Soviet Union. However, he was dismissed in October 1921 due to downsizing, and lived in extreme poverty, suffering frequently from pneumonia and for sometime lived in the apartment of Aleksey Krylov. From his retirement he asked for permission to get medical treatment abroad, and left for France in the autumn of 1924. He lived in exile in France in poverty until his death in 1930, with an income by selling his own oil paintings of seascapes. On his death, he was initially buried in the Russian Cemetery in Menton. In 2005 the urn containing his ashes was taken aboard the cruiser , which carried his remains to Novorossiysk. The ashes were then flown to Saint Petersburg and buried in his family vault in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra in accordance with his will. The Russian Navy has named the first of the Admiral Grigorovich-class frigates after Ivan Grigorovich. He was awarded Order of Prince Danilo I, Order of the Cross of Takovo and a number of other decorations.

It appropriates Christian images in a manner that is consistent with a naturalism that disclaims religious belief. (See Sunday Morning for another expression of that outlook.) Stevens's post-Christian sensibility channels emotions into nature rather than God and associated religious figures like Jesus and Mary. In this case, pathos and pity are channeled into autumn and the moon. Vendler has proposed that the weather is the only phenomenon to which Stevens was passionately attached,See the main Harmonium essay, the section \\"The Musical Imagist\\". and a poem like \\"Lunar Paraphrase\\" shows how that might be true, when the weather is understood as representing nature as a focus for emotions that otherwise might have been given religious expression. Stevens's poetic naturalism was a significant achievement, from which he may or may not have retreated at the end of his life, depending on what one makes of the evidence of a deathbed conversion to Catholicism. The movement of the moon's old light may be compared to the light in Tattoo, which crawls over the water like a spider.  Notes   References  *Stevens, H. Letters of Wallace Stevens. 1966: Alfred A.

It was built in 1875 by Louis Phillips, who by the 1890s had become the wealthiest man in Los Angeles County. Situated along the Butterfield Stage route, the Phillips Mansion became a center of community activity in the Pomona and Spadra area. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, making it among the first 25 sites in Los Angeles County to be so designated (there are now more than 450). Louis Phillips The Phillips Mansion was built in 1875 by Louis Phillips (c. 1830 - 1900). Phillips was born Louis Galefsky to a Jewish family in Prussia (now Kempen, Poland) and moved to California in the early 1850s, changing his name to Phillips.http://la.curbed.com/2017/4/6/15171016/phillips-mansion-spadra- pomona-valley-history He moved to Spadra (now part of Pomona) in 1862 and began engaging in sheep herding and cattle raising. In 1864, he purchased of the old Rancho San Jose for $30,000. In 1867, he married Esther Blake, with whom he had three sons (Charles, George and Louis, Jr.) and two daughters (Mrs. Frank George and adopted daughter, Kate Cecil). He also acquired large land holdings in other parts of the county, including the Los Angeles business district where he owned the Phillips Block on Spring Street, a block on Los Angeles Street and another on Third Street. By 1892, the Los Angeles Times reported that Phillips, \\"who lives so quietly out at Spadra, near Pomona,\\" was \\"the richest man in Los Angeles County.\\" The Times noted that Phillips was worth \\"not a dollar less than $3,000,000\\" and stated that, in addition to his land holdings in Los Angeles, he had a ranch that produced wool, honey and wheat. Architecture of the house Phillips Mansion and grounds. Currier House in background The Phillips Mansion was built in 1875 at a cost of over $20,000. It has been described as having been built in the \\"Second Empire\\" or \\"Classic Haunted Mansion architectural style.\\" It was built with ceilings and six fireplaces. The bricks were made at the site by Joseph Mulally of Los Angeles. With its use of a mansard roof, some have described it as being \\"in the style of the New Orleans French homes.\\" Another writer noted that it \\"looks as if it had been lifted bodily from the tree-lined street of a midwestern county seat,\\" the \\"kind of house the banker of such a town would build for himself.\\" The interior of the mansion is finished in cherry and maple wood that was hauled by horse and wagon from San Pedro. The mansion represented a number of firsts in the Pomona Valley, including the following: * The first home built with fired bricks; * The first home fitted with gas lighting; and * The first example of mansard roof architecture. Other than two Mexican-era adobe structures (the Ygnacio Palomares Adobe and the La Casa Primera de Rancho San Jose), the Phillips Mansion is also the oldest surviving house in the Pomona Valley. It has been named \\"one of the ten most stately mansions in Southern California.\\" History Rancho San Jose The property on which the Phillips Mansion was built is part of the 22,000 acre Rancho San Jose land grant awarded in 1837 by Gov. Juan B. Alvarado to Ricardo Vejar and Ygnacio Palomares. The Phillips Mansion was preceded by an adobe built in the 1860s, when the property was still part of the Rancho San Jose. Even before the construction of the Phillips Mansion, it was said that \\"the cluster of buildings by San Jose Creek at the foot of the Spadra Hills\\" was the center of life on the rancho. Use by Louis Phillips In 1864, Schlesinger and Tischler acquired the ranch in a foreclosure, and Phillips, who had previously been a manager on the ranch, bought out of the foreclosure for $30,000. In January 1874, the Southern Pacific Railroad completed a rail line from Los Angeles to Spadra, spurring interest in land development in the area. In 1875, Phillips built the mansion and also sold most of his for subdivision into the Pomona Tract, thus beginning the formation of Pomona. Phillips was one of the local land promoters (along with Garey, Holt and Towne) who laid out the town of Pomona in the summer of 1875. The new community was named after the goddess of fruit trees. However, Phillips preferred Spadra to Pomona, and retained surrounding his mansion, which he operated as a cattle and sheep ranch. It has been said that the Phillips Mansion \\"heralded the Yankee period\\" in the Pomona Valley. The mansion was a stage stop located where the Butterfield Stage Route intersected with the San Bernardino-Los Angeles Stage Road. Phillips also became postmaster for the Spadra area, and the mansion became both the post office and a center of social activities for the scattered settlers of the Pomona Valley in the late 19th century. Changes in ownership Phillips died from pneumonia at the mansion in 1900. His widow Esther lived at the mansion until 1916, and it remained in the Phillips family until 1931, when their grandson, Cecil George, sold it to Paul T. Boyle of Los Angeles. At that time, the property consisted of the house and with of frontage on Pomona Boulevard. George, who then lived in Hollywood, retained of walnut groves. In 1942 the house was sold to C.H. Brandmyer, of Glendale, California. At that time, the property consisted of the house and of citrus, and the Los Angeles Times reported that the home had never been remodeled. During World War II, the house was converted into an apartment house. At one time, the house was cut up like a rooming house into four apartments, and the dark interior woodwork was painted over. By 1959, ownership of the property had passed to Earl Isbil. Acquisition and operation by Historical Society During the 1960s, the area surrounding the Phillips Mansion had become largely industrial. In 1966, the mansion was heavily vandalized, and plans were announced to sell the property to a buyer who intended to build a paint factory on the site. At that time, the Historical Society of Pomona Valley, led by Fred W. Sharp, began a campaign to save the old mansion. The Historical Society ultimately purchased the mansion and restored it as a Yankee period museum to complement the Ygnacio Palomares Adobe, which was operated by the Historical Society as a museum focusing on the Mexican period. Pomona architect Amos W. Randall was in charge of the renovation master plan, and the restored mansion was opened for its first public viewings in 1978. Title to the mansion was later transferred to the City of Pomona, and the city and Historical Society now operate the mansion jointly. In 1973, the house was used as a location in the movie, Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural, which also used the small jail structure on the property.Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Paranormal (1973), DVD Commentary In 1981, a time capsule containing handmade bricks and squared nails from the Phillips Mansion was buried at the entrance to a master-planned community called \\"Phillips Ranch.\\" The community consists of 3,000 new single-family homes and was built on the site of Louis Phillips' ranch. The Phillips Mansion was damaged in the February 1990 Upland earthquake and the June 1991 Sierra Madre earthquake. The earthquakes caused the mansion's chimney to topple and resulted in cracks throughout the structure. The house was reopened on a limited basis for tours in October 1991, though visitors were required to wear hard hats. Between 2002 and 2008, the Historical Society and the City of Pomona undertook extensive renovation work on the house, which was closed during this time. In July 2008, the mansion suffered a further setback when it was damaged in the Chino Hills earthquake. Though the house had been scheduled to reopen to the public in the fall of 2008, visible cracks in the front of the building and back porch pushed back the date of its reopening, but the Mansion is now open for events and tours.http://pomonahistorical.org/index.html See also *List of Registered Historic Places in Los Angeles County, California References External links *Phillips Mansion - Pomona Historical Society Buildings and structures in Pomona, California Historic house museums in California History of Pomona, California Houses in Los Angeles County, California Museums in Los Angeles County, California Houses completed in 1875 Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in California Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Los Angeles County, California Second Empire architecture in California ","title":"Phillips Mansion"},{"id":"19104838","text":"Michael Butterworth (born January 7, 1985) is a former American football offensive tackle.

This frontier was of vital importance for both sides, as Murmansk was the only Soviet harbour left in Europe and the northern route to Murmansk and Arkhangelsk supplied the Soviet Union with approximately 25% of all lend-lease aid.http://www.feldgrau.com/econo.html Of all the lend-lease aid, approximately 50% was delivered via the Pacific, 25% via Persia and 25% via the northern route to Archangel and Murmansk. During the stalemate that lasted four years, thousands perished in the tundras on both sides of the river.

Two rifled brass 12-pounders and a plentiful supply of rifles, pistols and ammunition were transferred to her with enough provisions for a 3-month cruise. Lt. J. Low, CSN, with 15 men, was ordered on board with instructions for an African cruise in the direction of the Cape of Good Hope. On July 31, 1863 Tuscaloosa captured the American ship Santee with a cargo of rice and bonded her for $150,000. On August 8, Low brought his ship into Simon's Bay in South Africa, departing thence for a 90-day cruise during which he stopped at Angra Pequena, Southwest Africa, to discharge Tuscaloosa's cargo of wool and goat skins. On November 19, 1863 he put into St. Catherine's, Brazil, for supplies but was not allowed to purchase them and was informed he must depart before nightfall. From there Tuscaloosa returned to Simon's Bay on December 26, 1863 only to be seized the next day by British authorities as an uncondemned prize which had violated the neutrality of Her Majesty's Government. They ordered her to be held until properly reclaimed by her original owners. Lieutenant Low and his men left the ship and an officer and men from HMS Narcissus were placed on board. Her owners did not reclaim her and in March 1864 she was released by the British authorities. The Confederate States Navy was in no position to reclaim her, and so after the war, she was turned over to the Union Navy.

He had decided from an early age to become an actor, but had his hopes dashed when his father died and he had to help support the family. He was 17 at the time. Up to his call-up in 1939 at the outbreak of World War II, which included a spell in Bombay, he had joined the Crompton Stage Society, a local amateur company, playing character parts to stall his ambitions. After being demobbed he decided to turn professional, joining the Oldham Coliseum Theatre, and staying with them for 11 years. He rose to become theatre manager at Oldham, and later became the manager of the old Guildford Theatre until 1963; at both theatres he continued to act, and occasionally direct, as well as managing. His first television appearance was in 1963, and he was usually cast as civil servants or retired colonels. Longworth appeared in a 1972 episode of Lollipop written by Jimmy Perry, which could have led to his being chosen for the part of the Walmington-on-Sea Town Clerk. During the Dad's Army Stage Show, Longworth understudied (but, as he states, was thankfully never used for) Arthur Lowe. He also made a few films, and spent time flying around the globe visiting family, mixed in with the occasional voice over work, and appearances for the DAAS. He also appeared in another Jimmy Perry and David Croft sitcom Hi-de-Hi! as a Head Waiter. He was active from 1963 to 1996. He had been a regular at Dad's Army events over the years. His most recent public appearance was at the Dad's Army 40th Birthday celebrations at the Imperial War Museum in London shortly before his death. He died on 20 August 2008 in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, one month after his 90th birthday. His funeral was held on 5 September.Eric Longworth's obituary at the Dad's Army Appreciation Society Partial filmography * 'Turn-up for Tony' (1968, TV film) - Foreman * All Neat in Black Stockings (1968) - Businessman * Foreign Exchange (1970, TV film) - Boreman * Perfect Friday (1970) - House of Lords Messenger * Ooh‚Ä¶ You Are Awful (1972) - Passport Booth Customer (uncredited) * No Sex Please, We're British (1973) - Man with Lighter * The Bawdy Adventures of Tom Jones (1976) - Man at Ball (uncredited) References External links Obituary in The Telegraph * Obituary in The Times 1918 births 2008 deaths English male television actors People from Shaw and Crompton Actor-managers 20th- century theatre managers ","title":"Eric Longworth"},{"id":"19104969","text":"Hillsea Point Rock is an area of the English Channel located 0.5 nm south-east of Hillsea Point, Devon.

After school he initially joined the Port of London Authority, before going to the Royal Air Force College Cranwell in 1938. At Cranwell he excelled in boxing and rowing and was awarded his wings in 1940. Second World War Stephens' first posting was to No. 3 Squadron RAF, with whom he fought during the Battle of France. He became the Flight Commander of B Flight during this battle, while still holding the rank of pilot officer. On his return from France he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) and Bar, which were gazetted at the same time (and in fact on the same page of the London Gazette): Two entries on page After the fall of France, B Flight was posted to Scotland and reformed as No. 232 Squadron RAF, of which Stephens was Commanding Officer.

Set within Olympic National Park, it is part of the Bailey Range which is a subset of the Olympic Mountains. It was named in honor of Charles Dana who was an editor of The Sun, a New York newspaper. Precipitation runoff from Mount Dana drains into the Elwha River, thence into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Climate Set in the north-west portion of the Olympic Mountains, Mount Dana is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

Jasper Rootham Biography Jasper Rootham was born on 21 November 1910 in Cambridge, UK. Childhood and adolescence Rootham was an only child. His paternal grandfather was the singer, organist, and conductor Daniel Wilberforce Rootham (1837‚Äì1922). His father Cyril Rootham was a well-known musician and composer based at St John's College, Cambridge. His mother Rosamond Margaret Rootham (n√©e Lucas) had been a notable suffragette, and continued as a campaigner on various social issues throughout her life. Rootham studied at Tonbridge School before moving on to St John's College, Cambridge. University Rootham read Classics at St John's College, Cambridge, and commenced his studies there in 1928. He became acquainted with Enoch Powell with whom he formed a lifelong friendship. (Powell gave the address at Rootham's funeral in Wimborne in 1990.) During his vacations Rootham travelled in France, Germany and Switzerland, gaining fluency in French and German. Rootham distinguished himself in the classics, graduating with a double First. While at St John's he also found time for sport (St John's Rugby Club) and music (playing the cello in the Cambridge University Musical Society under the baton of his father Cyril Rootham). In August 1934 Rootham played the cello in Michael Tippett's \\"people's\\" opera \\"Robin Hood\\", conducted by the composer, at Boosbeck in North Yorkshire. Early career Rootham started his working life as a civil servant. At the start of the Second World War, Rootham was working in the office of prime minister Neville Chamberlain, where his fluency in French and German were often called upon during negotiations with the French and German governments. After Chamberlain's resignation in May 1940, Rootham worked for Chamberlain's successor as prime minister Winston Churchill. Second World War Anxious to play his part in the war effort, Rootham resigned from the Civil Service in 1941 to join the Special Operations Executive. He was posted to Cairo where he was trained as a parachutist, eventually to be dropped into Yugoslavia. While in Cairo, he also learned Russian in which he became fully fluent. On completion of his training he was parachuted into eastern Serbia with a small team of British soldiers as part of the Mission Greenwood- Rootham. Their purpose was to support the Serb army under Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá in their fight against the German army. Rootham became fluent in Serbo-Croat. However, the policy of the British government later changed, and UK support was switched from Mihailoviƒá to the communist partisans under Josip Broz Tito. At that point, Rootham and his British troops were hurriedly withdrawn from Yugoslavia ‚Äì an action which Rootham regarded as a betrayal of Mihailoviƒá. After the war had ended, he wrote an account of this military venture which was published under the title \\"Miss-Fire\\". In 1945, Rootham was posted to Berlin where his fluency in Russian involved him in negotiations with the Soviet army in the run-up to the Potsdam Conference. Marriage and family At the end of the Second World War in 1945, Rootham married Joan McClelland who was a ballerina with Ballet Rambert (later to become the Rambert Dance Company).Ballet Rambert In 1947, they had a son John Daniel (\\"Dan\\") Rootham, and in 1951 a daughter Catherine Virginia (\\"Tutu\\") Rootham. Joan McClelland continued to dance with Ballet Rambert until the birth of their second child, and in later years she also taught at Ballet Rambert. Post-war career On leaving the armed forces, Rootham joined the Bank of England where he remained for twenty years. In the mid-1950s Rootham and his wife travelled to Russia as part of an official delegation sent by the Bank of England. During his career at the Bank of England, Rootham travelled regularly to meetings of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel. In 1968, Rootham left the Bank of England to join the London merchant bank Lazard Brothers. He was once heard to remark that he made more profit for Lazard in preventing unprofitable deals than in acquiring new business. Rootham also held non-executive directorships with the British Sugar Corporation (now British Sugar plc) and with the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. Writings Throughout his life, Rootham found pleasure in writing. He wrote an autobiographical account of his wartime experiences in Yugoslavia under the title \\"Miss-Fire\\". Two novels \\"Demi- Paradise\\" and \\"Cupid and the Willow Wood\\" followed, and in his later years Rootham published several volumes of poetry.Open Library Musical activity Rootham was extremely keen that the music of his father Cyril Rootham should be performed and heard more widely. In 1936 Cyril Rootham composed a setting of Jasper's poem City in the West for chorus, string orchestra and harp - the city is Bristol, Cyril Rootham's birthplace.City in the West, op 93 From 1960 until his death in 1990, Jasper Rootham was tireless in promoting performances and recordings of Cyril's works. Several of these performances were released on LP or CD.

In 1958, he ran 20 races, with a single top 10 finish. 1959 was his best season, where he started 30 of 44 events, had 12 top 10 finishes including his first career top 5, and finished 4th in points. He made 2 starts in the NASCAR Convertible Division that year. In 1961, Beam suffered an engine failure at Richmond International Raceway. It was the last DNF for 84 races, starting the streak of finishing races that he is most famous for, which ended at Atlanta Motor Speedway in 1963. Beam retired from racing that year, but continued to field cars for other drivers, including Ned Jarrett and Cale Yarborough. Beam's nickname was \\"Turtle\\", reflecting his cautious driving style, which was to finish each race without retiring. His most famous moment was at the 1962 Richmond 250 race at the Atlantic Rural Fairgrounds at Richmond, Virginia. Due to heavy rain, qualifying was cancelled, and the drivers drew for grid positions by lot. Beam drew pole position, but pulled off the track on the pace lap to let the entire field go past. He eventually finished 12th. After the race Beam said that he did not feel comfortable starting in front of faster cars. Beam's 84-race streak took place over the span of 22 months 10 days, and was being threatened by Clint Bowyer, who if he finished the first ten races of the 2009 season could have tied the record. However, he crashed at the 2009 Southern 500 at Darlington to end his streak at 83 finished races. Bowyer's teammate Kevin Harvick fell three short when his engine failed in the 2009 Auto Club 500 ending his streak at 81 races without a DNF. After the 2014 FedEx 400, his 84-race streak was broken by Greg Biffle, who finished the race despite being 108 laps down in 38th. Another outstanding mark of Beam's was running the same number throughout his career. In all 194 of his starts, Beam drove only the number 19 in NASCAR Grand National races, the former record for officially retired drivers that has since been surpassed by Jeff Gordon, with 797 consecutive starts in the #24. Career as an owner After retiring from driving in the middle of the 1963 season, he remained a team owner in NASCAR. He hired Cale Yarborough to drive for him the rest of the season. In 1964, Larry Thomas and Yarborough split the ride for most of the season, with H.B. Bailey, Larry Frank, and Tiny Lund each driving one race for Beam. Yarborough left Beam's team after one race, and JT Putney was hired to drive the car. His team shut down after running only 2 races in 1966.

He appeared in numerous minstrel shows throughout the North after the American Civil War. Early life Schoolcraft was born in New Orleans, Louisiana into a family of actors and artists. His father, Henry R. Schoolcraft* was an actor who appeared in shows at Crisp's Gaiety Theater and who despite his death before 1860, saw to it that his son Luke and his daughters Jane and Alfreda (who would be famous in her own right as Alfreda Chippendale) all pursued careers in theater. Luke Schoolcraft's first stage performance was in 1851 in Rolla, the Richard Brinsley Sheridan adaptation of August von Kotzebue's Pizarro. * Not Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, who is credited with the discovery of the source of the Mississippi River. Career in minstrelsy Minstrelsy was America's first original contribution to the theater arts. It was popular from just before the American Civil War to the end of the 19th Century. Today minstrelsy and its attendant blackface is viewed as racist and anachronistic, however it was the preeminent entertainment in the United States during the life of Luke Schoolcraft, and he was one of the most well-known and successful performers. In Terre Haute Cover of Schoolcraft's Minstrel Sheet Music By his twenties, Schoolcraft was touring the nation and performing in variety shows. Negroes were not the only ethnic group who were lampooned in minstrel shows; indeed Schoolcraft began performing Dutch songs until several hits as a blackface performer landed him in the minstrel ranks. In 1870 he and his first wife Belle were living in St. Louis, Missouri among a troupe of actors that included George H. Coes. Schoolcraft also had an early association with Billy Emerson and Schoolcraft settled in Terre Haute, Indiana after 1870. He helped form a music academy in a former church that was popularly known as \\"Luke Schoolcraft's Academy of Music.\\" It was in Terre Haute that Schoolcraft met and wed his second wife, Elizabeth Clark on January 7, 1871. In New York City In 1872, Schoolcraft moved to New York City and made a spectacular debut at Richard M. Hooley's Opera House in Brooklyn on March 25, 1872. Newspapers there declared that he was \\"an immediate hit.\\" During this period, one of Schoolcraft's original songs, Oh! Dat Watermelon became popular. Today, this song is among the best-known minstrel pieces of that era. Partnership with Coes Schoolcraft joined with his old friend George H. Coes in 1874 and they formed \\"one of the most famous minstrel tandems in history.\\" Schoolcraft & Coes appeared with a number of leading companies including Emerson's Megatherian Minstrels and Barlow, Wilson, Primrose & West. By 1880, the two settled with their families in Cambridge, Massachusetts and continued to tour throughout the country performing their minstrel act in a variety of shows and venues. When Coes was unable to continue his career due to poor health in 1889, the partnership dissolved. Schoolcraft continued to perform solo as part of a number of shows including Lew Dockstader's popular minstrel troupe. In 1892, Schoolcraft was a star in Russell's Comedians, a troupe of specialty artists. It was with this company that he performed his final show at the Walnut Street Theater in Cincinnati, Ohio. He died on March 10, 1893 in his room at the Hotel Stratford. His body was transported to Boston, his funeral was held at the Church of the Advent and he was buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery in Dorchester, Massachusetts.

The company was formed by Best Buy's purchase of 50% of The Carphone Warehouse's retail division in May 2008. Best Buy branded superstores opened in the United Kingdom beginning on April 30, 2010, with a store in Thurrock, Essex. Best Buy was due to open its first stores in the United Kingdom in 2009, but in March 2009, the firm postponed this until 2010, with plans for up to two hundred stores eventually. Carphone originally intended to open up to two hundred Big Box stores in Europe by 2013, but this goal was reduced to one hundred. On 6 November 2011, Carphone Warehouse announced its intention to close the eleven Best Buy \\"big box\\" format stores. On 14 January 2012, the Best Buy Europe joint venture was discontinued, with all eleven stores and the transactional website (www.bestbuy.co.uk) closing on that day. Best Buy is sometimes called the \\"big blue box\\" because of the prominent design on Best Buy stores. This store is located in Westfield Merry Hill, West Midlands, UK.

On June 26, 2007, Best Buy announced a 40% increase in its operations, with plans to operate more than 1,800 stores worldwide, including 1,400 Best Buy stores in the United States. The Carphone Warehouse was co founded in 1989, when most portable phones were too bulky to carry and called car phones, by then CEO Charles Dunstone (together with David Ross) from ¬£6,000 savings. The two companies first began working together in 2006, creating Best Buy Mobile stores in the United States and introducing Geek Squad in the United Kingdom. Best Buy - About Best Buy - International Growth Best Buy Stores The first Best Buy store in the United Kingdom opened at Junction Retail Park, near Lakeside Shopping Centre in Thurrock, Essex on 30 April 2010. Twenty locations were originally planned for in the coming year, all to be in the big box format. The company was looking for a flagship store in Central London by July 2008, in a prominent area such as Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Street, or Regent Street. For fiscal year 2011, Best Buy UK saw full year losses nearly triple to ¬£62.2m, equivalent to just over ¬£10m for each of its stores trading during the period. Growth had been slower than some expected. The company blamed the grim results on \\"impressive\\" investments in its new stores but it is \\"evaluating\\" the next step in its strategy. The company had been reported to be considering bidding for Comet Group. The company closed all of its stores in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2012, due to poor financial results.

United Kingdom Naval service HMS Camperdown, circa 1896 They were originally mounted from 1885 onwards for use against the new (steam-driven) torpedo boats which started to enter service in the late 1870s. The Nordenfelt gun was adopted at the same time as the very similar QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss, but the Navy was not satisfied with the special Nordenfelt ammunition and fuzes. Following the explosion in 1900 of an ammunition ship due to defective fuses, Britain replaced Nordenfelt fuzes with the Hotchkiss design. Nordenfelt guns were phased out in favour of the Hotchkiss and were declared obsolete by 1919.Hogg & Thurston 1972, Page 36 Finland When Finland gained its independence from Russia in 1917 dozens of QF 6-pounder Nordenfelt cannons were stationed in Finland. After the Finnish Civil War in 1918 around 35 - 40 Nordenfelt cannons became available to the Finnish army. These guns were later used as a standard light coastal gun of the Finnish coastal artillery and were in service until the 1950s.

It is the most important research journal about China in the world and is published by the Cambridge University Press. It covers anthropology, business, literature, the arts, economics, geography, history, international affairs, law, politics, and sociology. Each issue contains articles and research reports, and a book review section. The China Quarterly is owned by the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. Its current editor-in-chief is Tim Pringle. History The China Quarterly began as an offshoot of Soviet Survey, a journal published by the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF). Walter Laqueur, the editor of Soviet Survey, asked sinologist Roderick MacFarquhar to edit the new journal in 1959, and the first issue was released in 1960. Publication of the journal was eventually transferred in 1968 from the CCF to the Contemporary China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London. The transfer followed the revelation that the CCF was funded by the Central Intelligence Agency; MacFarquhar stated that he \\"never knew about this relationship and had certainly not been subjected to attempts to 'control' my editorship from Paris [the location of the CCF].\\" However, he admitted to knowingly publishing articles provided by the CIA and the British Foreign Office's covert propaganda unit, the Information Research Department, and giving the authors pseudonyms to keep their identities secret. David Wilson succeeded MacFarquhar as editor in 1968.  Controversies  In August 2017 Cambridge University Press (CUP), the publisher, confirmed it had removed access to more than 300 articles from readers in China following pressure from Chinese government. Cambridge University Press stated they blocked this material in China to avoid having their entire publication blocked. The press published a list of the articles removed which included sensitive topics such as the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Pro-democracy movements in Hong Kong and the negative effects of the Cultural Revolution. Several academics criticised the decision of Cambridge University Press to self-censor, however CUP stated that it was \\"troubled by the recent increase in requests of this nature\\" and was committed to academic freedom. The Guardian reported the censorship was part of a broader crack-down on dissent since Xi Jinping became the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in 2012.

It was founded by the Lazarists, and built in 1892‚Äì1894 at ul. Misjonarska 37 street in the district of Krowodrza. It has been a parish church since 1923. In interwar Poland, a polyphonic choir was established by the congregation in 1932. The Maria≈Ñski Choir has attracted international acclaim for a number of years. History The corner-stone for the construction of the church was laid on June 25, 1892, although the first Congregation of the Mission already existed in nearby Stradom district in the second half of the 17th century, augmented by the Missionary house built at Kleparz in 1861 with the Seminary founded in 1878. The church, designed by architect Stefan ≈ªo≈Çdani in the Gothic Revival style, was completed in two years under the direction of Cardinal Albin Dunajewski. The parish was founded on January 1, 1923. Two more parishes were established further apart in Communist Poland. The church was upgraded and repainted several times. Side-altars were added and the presbytery was enlarged. The figure of Our Lady of Lourdes featured at the main altar, and carved in wood, is an exact copy of the Mother of God from the Grotto of Apparitions at Lourdes in south-western France, a major place of Roman Catholic pilgrimage and miraculous healings visited by John Paul II in August 2004. Architecture The church building has a total length of 42.9 metres, with a width of 16.5 m, and a height of 20.8 m (to the top of metal roof) or 45.5 m to the top of the steeple. It consists of a nave with two aisles. The aisles are separated from the nave by a row of pillars and columns. The central nave is 8.5 m wide, with a height of 16.5 m. The aisles are 2.5 m wide. The church has three altars, and a pipe organ by the entrance, supported by metal columns. It was built originally in the 19th century by Otto Rieger of Silesia. Maria≈Ñski Choir The church is home to the Maria≈Ñski Choir (), founded in 1932 by Rev. J√≥zef Orszulik during the interwar years,. It specializes in the music of the Renaissance and Baroque periods, but also performs Medieval and contemporary choral works. The mixed voice choir performs the music of J.S. Bach, W.A. Mozart, J. Haydn, G.F. Handel, as well as Polish composers F. Nowowiejski, A. Koszewski, J. ≈öwider, W. Kilar, J. ≈Åuciuk, H.M. G√≥recki and others. The choir performs and makes commercial recordings of Christmas carols annually. The proceeds from the sale of CDs are used to support charity actions by the Congregation of the Mission. The Maria≈Ñski Choir gives regular concerts, including some at the church itself. It performs at ceremonial functions during national holidays. Also, it participates in festivals across Europe and North America. It has made over 35 foreign trips including tours of Italy (with a performance at Castel Gandolfo), Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Czech Republic, United States, Hungary, and Lithuania. The group has released several recordings, notably collections of traditional songs popular with the audience during Christmas. The choir has received several prestigious awards including the 2012 First Place award at the Lesser Poland competition of choirs in Niepolomice, the Third Place award at the International Festival of Choirs in 2011, the Bronze Medal of Cracoviae Merenti competition (for overall accomplishments), as well as the Silver Thread and Trophy at the 19 International Festival of Advent Music in Prague in 2009, among others.

Prior to the Civil War, hundreds of people took the train to Carrollton to tour the famed Carrollton Gardens or to dine at the Carrollton House or another of the village's restaurants.Williams, p. 281-82. Among the antebellum officials was the line's secretary, Albert Blanchard, who would become a Confederate brigadier general in the Civil War. During the war, the line continued period operation, despite the Federal army occupying the city. Ridership and revenues were drastically reduced, and the railroad suffered financially. Following the Civil War, the line was leased to former Confederate general P.G.T. Beauregard, who with two financial backers, assumed control of the NO&CRR; in April 1866. However, his partners proved untrustworthy, and Beauregard was publicly embarrassed when the line failed to pay its debts within a few years.Williams, P. 285. However, the railroad survived. The line evolved into an urban tram line as the land along the route was developed and incorporated into the city of New Orleans. It is now the St. Charles Avenue Streetcar Line.Cook, p. 136. In 1922 the New Orleans & Carrollton Rail Road was merged into New Orleans Public Service Incorporated (NOPSI), which consolidated the city's various streetcar lines and electrical production. In 1983, NOPSI became part of privately owned Entergy, and transferred all transportation operations to the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority (NORTA).

Since its release, critics have praised its sound, which combines elements of screamo with post-rock, and it is now seen as an essential recording of early 2000s screamo. The album would eventually become out-of-print for years, however Repeater Records reissued a remastered version of the album on LP format on May 27, 2016. Background and recording The band recorded the album in Maryland between the years 2001 and 2002, hiring Mark Smoot to record and master it. According to guitarist/vocalist Brandon Evans, the band frequently listened to The Cure's album Pornography during the recording sessions, and most of the mixing decisions were influenced by the album. Of the recording sessions, only one track was left off the final album, titled \\"As the Curtains Dim (Little White Lie)\\". The track would later be released as a digital single in 2016, as well as being released as the b-side to the group's 2017 \\"Driving Spain Up a Wall\\" 12\\" single. Critical reception and legacy City of Caterpillar is now seen by critics as one of the best screamo albums from the early 2000s. Named as one of Treble Zine's ten essential screamo albums in 2014, A.T. Bossenger called it \\"consistently unpredictable\\" and \\"an irresistibly thrilling ride\\". In Blake Butler's review of the album for the Allmusic Guide, he rewarded the album a near-perfect four and a half stars out of a possible five, stating that the group's \\"moody, sometimes spastic, sometimes brooding breed of dark rock is both well-written and timeless\\", concluding his write up by stating \\"albums of this breed only come along a few times in a genre.\\" Punknews.org staff member Jordon Rogowski similarly rated the album four and a half stars out of five, calling it \\"one of the most promising releases [he has] heard in years.\\" In an article for Vice about both the album and the band, Jason Heller states that City of Caterpillar is \\"something we'll never stop being in awe of.\\" The album is now seen to of help influence the post-rock-meets-screamo style that is sometimes called \\"post-screamo\\". The album has helped influence artists such as Envy and Circle Takes the Square.

He was the son of Thomas Hoby and Elizabeth Cooke, the nephew of William Cecil, Lord Burghley, and the son- in-law of Queen Elizabeth's cousin Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon. A favourite of King James, Hoby published several works supporting the Protestant cause as well as translations from French and Spanish. His heir was his illegitimate son, Peregrine Hoby.Cooper, A Guide to Tudor & Jacobean Portraits, p. 20. Biography Born at Bisham Abbey, Berkshire, in 1560, Edward Hoby was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Hoby and his wife Elizabeth, third daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke or Coke of Gidea Hall, Essex. He was educated at Eton, where he formed a lasting friendship with Sir John Harington, and at Trinity College, Oxford. At Trinity Thomas Lodge, who later became a dramatist, was \\"servitor or scholar\\" under him. Under the auspices of his uncle, Lord Burghley,Burghley's wife Mildred was the sister of Hoby's mother. he rose into high favour at the Elizabethan court and was frequently employed on confidential missions. Hoby's fortunes were further advanced by his marriage, on 21 May 1582, to Margaret, daughter of Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon, cousin of Queen Elizabeth. The day after the wedding he was knighted by the Queen. In August 1584 he accompanied his father-in-law Hunsdon on a special mission to Scotland. His affability and learning greatly impressed King James VI (later James of England), and after attending the Scottish ambassador, Patrick, Master of Gray, as far as Durham, Hoby received from the Scottish king a flattering letter, dated 24 October 1584, in which James intimated his longing for his company, and how he had \\"commanded his ambassador to sue for it.\\" James Stewart, Earl of Arran also wrote to the same effect, and enclosed a \\"small token,\\" which he begged Hoby to wear in \\"testimony of their brotherhood\\". These amenities proved displeasing to Elizabeth, and Hoby found it convenient for a time to plead the ague as an excuse for not attending the court. Another effigy of early 15th-century date was dug up in the churchyard in 1833 and this lies against the north wall of Minster Abbey. Some sources suggest this is General Geronimo who appears in the Register as being buried in December 1591. He was captured in a Spanish galleon by Sir Edward Hoby in 1588 and held hostage in Queenborough Castle. The ransom was never paid and he died in captivity. He clasps a small egg-shaped image in his hands which is said to represent his soul. On 24 September 1586 he was returned as one of the two members of parliament for Queenborough, Kent, and gained distinction as a speaker in Parliament. That October he complained that he had been \\"not only bitten but overpassed by the hard hand of\\" Francis Walsingham, and appealed to Secretary William Davison to use his influence with the queen on his behalf. Restored to favour, in July 1588 Hoby was chosen to report to the queen on the progress of the preparations against the Spanish Armada. That October he was elected a knight of the shire for Berkshire. He was made justice of the peace for Middlesex by a special renewal of the commission on 17 December 1591. In 1592 he was chosen as a knight of the shire for Kent, and in 1594 was granted letters patent for buying and providing wool for sale in England for ten years, and the grant was ratified in the succeeding reign. Hoby accompanied the Earl of Essex on his expedition to C√°diz in 1596, and was made constable of Queenborough Castle, Isle of Sheppey, Kent, on 9 July 1597. On the following 28 October Hoby received a commission to search out and prosecute all offences against the statute prohibiting the exportation of iron from England, his reward being half the forfeitures arising therefrom. He represented Rochester in the parliaments of 1597, 1601, February 1604, and 1614. James I made him a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, forgave his arrears of rent of the Royal Manor of Shirland in Derbyshire (amounting to over ¬£500), and on 21 August 1607 granted him an exclusive licence to buy wool in Warwickshire and Staffordshire. He frequently entertained the king at Bisham. Hoby's wife died in 1605, and he later married Cicely Unton (d. 1618), the daughter of Sir Edward Unton and Lady Anne Seymour, and widow of John Wentworth. Hoby died in Queenborough Castle on 1 March 1617. He and his wives had no children, but he brought up his illegitimate son by Katherine Pinkney, Peregrine Hoby, and made the boy his heir. Works An excellent scholar himself, Hoby cultivated the friendship of learned men, especially that of William Camden, who eulogises his bounty and accomplishments in his Britannia. Camden also dedicated his Hibernia (1587) to him. In 1612 Hoby presented a copy of Sir Henry Savile's sumptuous edition of St Chrysostom to the library of Trinity College, Oxford. Hoby was also a keen Protestant theologian, sparring in print with the Roman Catholic convert Theophilus Higgons and the Jesuit John Fludd or Floyd. Hoby's theological writings include: * A Letter to Mr. T[heophilus] H[iggons], late Minister: now Fugitive ... in answere of his first Motive, (1609), which was answered by Higgons during the same year. * A Counter-snarle for Ishmael Rabshakeh a Cycropedian Lycaonite (1613), being a reply to The Overthrow of the Protestants Pulpet Babels, by \\"J. R.\\" (John Fludd or Floyd). Floyd forthwith replied with his Purgatories triumph over Hell, maugre the barking of Cerberus in Syr Edward Hobyes \\"Counter-snarle\\" (1613). *A Curry-combe for a —Å–æ—Ö–µ-combe . . .

Hoby also translated Matthieu Coignet's Politique discourses on trueth and lying from French (1586), and Bernardino de Mendoza's Theorique and Practise of Warre from Spanish (1597).

Originally Katharine Hepburn was assigned to the lead role. She refused, however, and left RKO in order to avoid having to appear in the film. In 1963, Walt Disney released Summer Magic, a loose remake of this film, with Hayley Mills as Nancy Carey. Plot Mr. Carey, a captain in the United States Navy, dies during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. His wife Margaret, daughters Nancy and Kitty and sons Gilbert and Peter are left behind. They are now on their own with only Capt. Carey's pension for income. The family moves into a series of ever-smaller rented houses while Mrs. Carey works in a textile mill. When she is injured, they lease a broken down mansion for a year at a nominal fee, and invest the captain's small life insurance payment to fix it up into a boarding house. Both daughters fall in love, Kitty with a local teacher and Nancy with Tom Hamilton, the son of the absentee owner. When the Hamiltons put the house up for sale, the family is given an eviction order by Tom Hamilton, a doctor who wants the money from the sale to study in Europe. However, fate intervenes and Tom is called to save Peter from a serious illness, then falls in love with Nancy. The new owners, the Fullers, move in to force the family to vacate.

They sat first in the Senate, before the secular officials. Only Roman Catholic bishops sat in the Senate (see Senatorial offices for details). Competences The most important official among the bishops was the Primate ‚Äî the Archbishop of Gniezno. From 1572, the first time that Poland had been without a king (the Jagiellon Dynasty having died out with King Zygmunt II August), the Archbishop of Gniezno served as interrex ‚Äî interim head of state until a new king could be elected. He represented the country and prepared elections for a new king. In addition, the Archbishop of Gniezno had the power to call a new Senate session, if he deemed it important to do so, even in the absence of the King. He could also invoke the \\"de non praestanda obedientia\\" article, giving the country the right to legally depose the King. From among other senators, he chose his own court marshal (often a castellan). That person acted as the Archbishop's messenger during Senate meetings, giving signs (by moving a cross) that conveyed how the Archbishop wished his allies to vote.

The eight characters (Keo, Lola, Luisa, Macalosh, Ombra, Pinen, Sgiosa Capeli, Tony) can be controlled with either a joystick or a keyboard and have the ability to punch or kick in the range of weak, medium, and strong. Reception The game was derided by critics. Stuart Campbell of Amiga Power gave it a rating of 3%, describing it as the worst game for the CD32 and one of the worst games ever. The Amiga CD32 version is included in Stuart Ashen's 2015 book Terrible Old Games You've Probably Never Heard Of, in which he remarks that Dangerous Streets looks \\"quite pretty\\" in screenshots, expressing that \\"characters are competently drawn and well-defined, and the backgrounds are colourful\\". He however expresses that this is no longer the case when the characters move, as Ashen calls Dangerous Streets' animation \\"beyond laughable\\", and speculates that this was \\"a marketing strategy to make magazine reviews and the back of the box more impressive\\". Ashen criticises Dangerous Streets' gameplay and controls, calling its fighting moves \\"an almost animation-free cavalcade of seemingly random, jerky attacks with no thought put into how they would affect the gameplay\\", and expresses that the controls \\"make no sense\\" and moving quickly is \\"a nightmare\\" due to the character's \\"bizarre\\" jump animations.

History In 1918 Southwest Texas Normal School (SWT) built the Education Building ‚Äúintended in large part as a demonstration and laboratory school.‚Äù San Marcos High School was originally built on the block of Comanche and Hutchison. In 1939 the Auditorium-Laboratory School Building was completed by the college and all public school students, kindergarten through 6th grade, were housed there. By 1941 all the public school students were located on the college campus. By 1949 the college and the public schools were so full that the last of the Coronal Buildings were destroyed to build a new High School on the site. In the fall of 1951 the first students moved into the brand new school, which consisted of grades 10-12. In the fall of 1952, grades 9 through 12 were housed in the high school. Bonham Elementary opened in 1951, Travis Junior High School and Bowie Elementary opened in 1954, and Crockett Elementary in 1964. By 1965, all San Marcos Public Schools were gone from the Southwest Texas campus. In the following years, San Marcos CISD had continued to construct new campuses. This included the San Marcos High School which today is the Lamar Annex. It was used as the high school campus from 1951 until 1958. A newer High School was built in 1958 on Highway 123 and remained there for 45 years. In 2003, San Marcos voters approved a multimillion-dollar bond to construct new district facilities, which included funds to construct the newly completed campus on McCarty Lane.

He became a significant informant against the Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO), a Camorra organization in Naples. He would be used by the Italian Justice Department to testify about the NCO's show business connections in Northern Italy, during the three-year- long Maxi Trial which began in 1983.Jacquemet, Credibility in Court, pp. 76-79 However, many of his accusations were later proven to be unfounded. He is particularly infamous for the frame-up of the popular Italian talk show host, Enzo Tortora, whom he falsely accused of Cocaine trafficking and NCO membership. Melluso was known by his multiple nicknames, \\"Gianni il Bello\\", or \\"Cha-cha-cha\\", both of which meant \\"beautiful\\" (the latter expression having that meaning in the Italian slang of the time). Biography Criminal career A native of Sicily, Melluso had migrated to Milan at the age of 18 in 1974. According to Melluso, Turatello had asked him to become a member of his organization. Melluso refused, only accepting work as an outside contractor dealing cocaine in the show-business world. Melluso rounded up the activity of drug dealer for Turatello, by working as a pimp and occasionally committing petty burglaries. During this period, he also adopted numerous false identities including Michele Tiano, Sante Breguglio, Mario Dalleri, Giuseppe Montalbano, Vincenzo Campo, and Paolo Belvisi. Melluso chose to operate in the Italian Riviera, and had a smooth operation running until the end of 1978, when he was arrested for armed robbery and sentenced to 16 years imprisonment. Subsequent sentences and comparisons with repentants of the caliber of Renato Vallanzasca and Angelo Epaminonda show that Melluso never actually met Turatello. Becoming a pentito After six years of rigorous imprisonment, Melluso decided to become a pentito. On March 2, 1984, when the preliminary hearings of the trial against the Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO) were already in motion, he asked to be transferred from his prison cell to the Carabinieri barracks. There, he declared to an investigating magistrate of his decision to change his life because he was tired of the prison conditions and also because one of his former associates, Andrea Villa, had already decided to collaborate and had involved Melluso in his testimony. In the long run, Melluso wanted a reduction of his prison sentence, in exchange for his testimony. Upon becoming a pentito, Melluso was granted accommodation in the Carabinieri barracks, where he was treated more as a guest than as a prisoner. He received various visits from his wife, who reportedly became pregnant during this period. He was able to dress well, and enjoyed an easy life under the protection of the Carabinieri. Even when other pentiti had to return to their prison, Melluso was able to prolong his stay by timing the delivery of his information, in a skilled exchange of evidence for perks. When his brother was killed some time after his denunciation of the activities of the Turatello gang, Melluso used this fact as a bargaining chip to complain about and demand better security. Giovanni Melluso was not a Neapolitan, did not live in Naples, and was not known as a Camorrista by the Justice department. Since he had always operated in Northern Italy, he did not have any intimate knowledge of the criminal underworld in Naples. He claimed to have only been an outsider in Turatello's business and to have never belonged to his organization. He also denied membership in the NCO. Unlike the other pentiti such as Pasquale Barra, Giovanni Pandico and Luigi Riccio, Melluso never admitted to any horrible crime. However, Melluso's repentance had some value for the Justice Department because it need some evidence to back its prosecutions of NCO's connections in the show business industry in Northern Italy. In court, Melluso proved to be a skillful performer, able to answer on cue, fend off attacks from the defense, and to animate his accounts with precise details and colourful anecdotes. False testimony against Enzo Tortora Italian talk show host, Enzo Tortora being led by the carabinieri during his 1983 arrest. In 1983, the Justice Department had arrested some well-respected members of the Italian show business industry who had been above suspiscion, thus attracting much needed public attention to the work of law-enforcement agencies in cracking down on Organized Crime. This move was inspired by the Justice department's perception that a drive against Organized Crime could only be successful if public opinion was focused on it, and therefore strove very hard to find any incriminating evidence against people able to attract media attention. Giovanni Melluso was the chief witness against Enzo Tortora, perhaps Italy's most famous talk show host, who was falsely accused of receiving and selling over ten kilograms of cocaine on different occasions by people affiliated with the NCO. He became instrumental in helping the Justice department to substantiate its charges against Tortora, when he confessed to having had various encounters with Tortora in delivering him cocaine. Melluso claimed that these dealings took place in 1976 in the streets of Milan, where both men lived. Later, towards the end of the same year, Melluso went to the office of an attorney, Cacciola, where he supposedly met Tortora and two other persons, whom he later identified as Roberto Calvi and Francesco Pazienza. According to Melluso, Tortora had a cosmetic case full of money which he showed to Calvi and Pazienza. After three hours of talk, the attorney Cacciola presented Tortora with a bag of cocaine and he handed it to Melluso to deliver it to Rome. Prior to his arrest in 1978, Melluso twice delivered cocaine to Tortora, 5 or 7 kilos the first time in a night club called Derby in Viale Monterosa, and the smaller package a second time in a public square, (Piazzale Loreto or Piazzale Corvetto). As evidence of his good relationship with Tortora, Melluso claimed to have had a photograph showing the two together, but to have destroyed it after Tortora's arrest in 1983. Melluso's testimony was corroborated by seven other pentiti, among them, Giovanni Pandico, Luigi Riccio, Mario Incarnato, Pasquale Barra, etc. Based on these testimonies, Tortora was eventually convicted of cocaine trafficking and NCO membership in 1985 and sentenced to ten years in prison.Bull & Newell, Italian Politics, p. 149 Tortora was detained for 7 months before being cleared of all the charges by a court of cassation 4 years later in 1987.Enzo Tortora: Justice betrayed , Panorama, August 27, 1986 He developed cancer and died 1 year after the case was finally solved, some say because of the emotional stress of his imprisonment.Schneider & Schneider, Reversible Destiny, p. 144 Testimony against other associates In March, 1984, the Investigation Office of the Tribunal of Naples gave the Prosecution office of Milan, a copy of the statements made by Melluso concerning the alleged drug dealing activity of Walter Chiari, Patrizia Caselli and Antonino Cusumano. Melluso had made accusations against these people that were remarkably similar to those concerning Tortora: purchase and sale of considerable quantities of cocaine, giving a detailed account of the encounters with the two actors. On July 19, 1986, the investigating judge acquitted the three accused.Enzo Tortora: Justice betrayed, Panorama, August 27, 1986 He motivated the sentence as follows: :\\"The enquiry has proved in a clear and evident way that the accusation is groundless. Melluso is deliberately lying when he accuses the above mentioned persons\\". Secondly, the preventive assiduity with other collaborators of the justice appears highly suspect, for the reasonable possibility of there being a mutual influence, and in the specific circumstance made evident by the fact that the first input to the investigation was provided precisely by that Andrea Villa whom Melluso refers to explain the reasons for his decision to cooperate with the justice.\\" Credibility in question Giovanni Melluso's credibility as a witness has been disputed and undermined from the very beginning. He has been accused of lying on the witness stand in order to further his own importance and reliability as a witness. For instance, in the Enzo Tortora trial, many of the other pentiti who corroborated his accusations would later retract their statements. The first was Mario Incarnato who stated that he was forced to accuse Tortora after nine months. Another pentito, Guido Catapano, wrote to Tortora in prison that he had shared the cell with Melluso for six months in the Campobasso penitentiary, and was well aware that the accusations made against him were slanders. He stated that Melluso had admitted to lying and that the only time he had seen Tortora was in a television show. He further stated that Melluso admitted to having been in Sicily at the time of the alleged meeting, and was afraid of being contradicted. Another pentito, Roberto Sganzerla wrote a similar letter confirming this fact. One of the principal witnesses against the NCO Pasquale D'Amico, also wrote to Tortora stating that Melluso was a big liar. A pentito, Michele Tassini, who testified on May 14, 1986, before the Tribunal of Naples against the Giuliano gang, stated that Riccio, Incarnato and Melluso wanted him to make statements against Tortora to further their own statements and that it was Melluso himself who was more deeply involved in the affair. Yet another pentito, Salvatore Sanfilippo, begged forgiveness in a letter to Tortora. He stated that he was threatened with murder by Pandico, Melluso and the other pentiti, if he failed to back up their accusations. He was asked to say among many things that Tortora was plotting an attack against the Public Prosecutor, Diego Marmo, to be more credible in the reconfirmation of the accusations. Also, the judges of the Third Branch have mentioned that the pentiti themselves conjured up these accusations. Furthermore, Melluso claimed to have given a kilogram of cocaine to Tortora between the end of 1975 and the beginning of 1976, which was simply impossible as Melluso was in the Sciacca prison from November 19, 1975, to April 6, 1976. Melluso's association with Francis Turatello has also come under attack from many investigating magistrates as well as other pentiti. In the course of the debate of the fourth branch of the trial against the NCO, Roberto Sganzerla stated that Melluso was never a drug dealer working for Turatello. This was further corroborated on July 9, 1983, by Angelo Epaminonda, Turatello's successor who became a pentito after his arrest, and was considered to be extremely reliable by the magistrates of Milan. New imprisonment On July 24, 2012, Melluso was arrested due to a charge of pimping.The arrest of Melluso References *Bull, Martin J. & James Newell (2005).

Along with Antonius Hambroek and Joannes Cruyf, he was among the longest-serving missionaries of the Dutch colonial era in Formosa. Mission in Formosa On arriving in Formosa, Junius took up residence in the village of Sakam, in the vicinity of Fort Provintia in present-day Tainan City. Described as more energetic than his contemporary, George Candidius, Junius was involved in the pacification of Taiwanese aborigines following the slaughter of sixty Dutch people by the natives of Mattau. This took the form of a short punitive war against the offending villages by Dutch forces, resulting in the killing of \\"a few dozen\\" aborigines and a Pax Hollandica which followed after the recalcitrant tribes had been cowed. Following this campaign, Junius continually urged the authorities in Batavia to send more clergymen to Formosa to assist in the instruction and conversion of the now amenable natives, something in which he was supported by the governor of the time, Hans Putmans. However, he was ultimately disappointed by the response from the colonial administrative centre. In 1636, Junius established the first school in Formosa, teaching a class of 70 boys to write their mother tongue in roman letters. In 1641, he was called to Batavia to report to the Consistory (the religious administrative body for Asia), and asked whether he would like to continue his service in Formosa. He agreed to return for two years, provided that :\\"arrangements were made to have his salary increased, and on condition that his brethren would write to Governor Traudenius about him, as that gentleman had given him some trouble.\\" These requests were agreed upon, and Junius returned to Formosa until late 1643. The numbers of baptisms under Junius' authority were impressive, even with Junius' work confined to the few villages around the Dutch strongholds of Fort Zeelandia and Fort Provintia. One commentator remarks that :\\"At the end of thirteen years he could report that one thousand and seventy people had been baptized at a single station, Soulang, 'and a proportionate number at the other villages,' of which he names five\\". Return to Holland On December 14, 1643, Junius again went to Batavia at the end of his commission. The Consistory again requested him to return to Formosa to continue his ministry, but this time Junius declined and decided instead to go back to his homeland, Holland. He married in 1645 in Delft, lived on Koornmarkt until 1653 when he accepted a post in Amsterdam. He died of the plague in Amsterdam in 1655.

Their numbers varied over time and with the shifting borders of the Commonwealth. In the Kingdom of Poland and later in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Castellans () usually deferred to the higher ranking Voivodes, excepting three Distinguished Castellans of the cities of Troki, Vilnius, and of Krak√≥w - who ranked higher than the Voivodes. Competences With the exception of the Castellan of Krak√≥w, whose seat was representative of the Commonwealth's capital until 1596, Castellans were usually considered subordinate to Voivodes. Two castellans in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania - those of Wilno and Troki - were also considered privileged, and had a status equal to a voivode. Castellans were in charge of a subdivision of a Voivodship called a Castellany (Polish: Kasztelania) until the late 15th century when domains were administratively divided into provinces in the case of larger castellanies and powiats for smaller castellanies. From 1565, the principle of \\"incompatibilitas\\" - \\"incompatibility\\" - precluded Voivodes and Castellans from holding a second ministerial role, except for the post of Hetman.

In Drukpa, druk means 'dragon' which is a symbol of peace.The Biographies of Rechungpa: The Evolution of a Tibetan hagiography. Roberts, Peter Alan. Routledge, 2007. p. 53 Drukpa Lineage alt=The Gyalwang Drukpa The Drukpa lineage was founded in 1206 after Drogon Tsangpa Gyare, (Drogon - 'Protector of Beings'; Tsang - 'born in the land of Tsang'; Gya - 'from the noble clan of Chinese (Gya) origin'; Re - 'a cotton-clad yogi') after he saw nine dragons fly into the sky from the ground at Namdruk. He is known as the First Gyalwang Drukpa and is recognized as the indisputable emanation of Naropa (1016‚Äì1100). Jigme Pema Wangchen is the twelfth and present incarnation of the Gyalwang Drukpa. He was born while his parents were on pilgrimage in Tso Pema, (Rewalsar, Mandi) Himachal Pradesh, a sacred place of Padmasambhava, during the festival and a major ceremony of lama dances and a holy feast celebrating Guru Padmasambhava's birthday, in 1963. His father, Zhichen Bairochana, is a Dzogchen Master, these days commonly called Bairo Rinpoche. His mother, Kelsang Yudron, commonly known as Mayumla, came from Lhodrak, in southern Tibet. The name Jigmet Pema Wangchen was given right after his birth by Dudjom Rinpoche, at that time head of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism: \\"My name, Jigmet Pema Wangchen was given by the holy Master Dudjom Yeshe Dorje with his traditional congratulations and divine blessings. Ever since then, I am blessed and entirely protected by him and Guru Padmasambhava forever.\\" He was enthroned as a reincarnation of the 11th Gyalwang Drukpa at the age of four at Druk Thupten Sangag Choeling Monastery in Darjeeling, his main monastery. Humanitarian activities and recognitions alt=The Gyalwang Drukpa received the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG) Honour in September 2010 The Gyalwang Drukpa is an active environmentalist, educator and the spiritual head of the Drukpa Lineage, one of the main Buddhist schools of the Himalayas founded by the great Indian saint Naropa (1016‚Äì1100CE) with a thousand-year legacy in India. He applies ancient Buddhist philosophy to resolve today's problems and has millions of followers worldwide. One of the Gyalwang Drukpa's main focuses is on environmental preservation and education, which puts into action the core Buddhist principle that all beings are interconnected and interdependent. His mission is to promote universal harmony and inner peace by integrating the spiritual tenets of love and appreciation into daily life. His work also includes encouraging gender equality, establishing educational institutions, medical clinics and meditation centres and rebuilding heritage sites in the Himalayas. He is the founder and spiritual director of the award-winning Druk White Lotus School in Ladakh, India, which provides its students with a modern education while preserving their local culture. Green Hero Award for the Gyalwang Drukpa, received on his behalf by Drukpa Thuksey Rinpoche Emphasizing that everyone can have a dramatic positive impact on the community around them, the Gyalwang Drukpa teaches that we should put compassion into action. In recognition of these activities, the Gyalwang Drukpa received the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG) Honour in September 2010 and three months later in December 2010, he received Green Hero Award, presented by the President of India. Kung Fu Nuns of the Drukpa Order Historically, women in the Himalayas have struggled to receive equal treatment, sometimes being ostracised for seeking to practise spirituality. The Gyalwang Drukpa is working to change this and has established the Druk Gawa Khilwa Nunnery ‚Äì a modern and green abbey outside Kathmandu, Nepal with a satellite abbey in Ladakh, India. There, women receive a modern education, as well as spiritual training historically reserved for men. In an effort to instill self- confidence, the Gyalwang Drukpa has also authorized them to learn kung fu, training that was off-limits to women for over two centuries. These kung fu nuns are gaining worldwide recognition. A BBC News documentary featured them.The Kung Fu nuns of Ladakh In addition, they have performed at the Olympic Park in London and at the CERN in Geneva.Kung fu nuns teach cosmic energy to CERN scientists The Gyalwang Drukpa regularly addresses the international community on contemporary issues including environmental protection, gender equality and religious tolerance. He attends the annual United Nations week in New York, where he speaks at different UN Women's forums meeting with like-minded women leaders such as Cherie Blair, Geena Davis and Her Royal Highness Princess Basmah bint Saud, attends high-level meetings concerning world conflicts, and participates at various discussions on climate change. The Gyalwang Drukpa also collaborates with well-respected international organizations to promote the message of active compassion as well as to find effective and sustainable solutions to bridge materialism and spirituality. Most recently, the Gyalwang Drukpa visited the CERN in SwitzerlandKung fu nuns teach cosmic energy to CERN scientists with several of his kung fu nuns to discuss the seeming tension of religion and science in society, as well as the improvement of gender equality. He often meets with several United Nations branches, including the World Health Organization, to discuss, among other things, potential cooperation in improving health worldwide. Live to Love In his effort to use Buddhist approaches to solve modern day problems, the Gyalwang Drukpa founded the Live to Love global humanitarian movement in 2007. Live to Love is an international consortium of secular, non-profit organizations working together to achieve five aims: Education, Environmental Protection, Medical Services, Relief Aid and Heritage Preservation. Beyond its formal aims, Live to Love hopes to inspire others to integrate acts of love ‚Äì big and small ‚Äì into their daily lives. =Environmental protection= alt=Historic Eco Pad Yatra in the Himalayas in 2009 The Gyalwang Drukpa named \\"The Guardian of the Himalayas\\" The Himalayan region, known as the 'third pole' supplies water to nearly one-half of the world's population and is disproportionately impacted by global warming. Live to Love sponsors several unique and world-renowned projects focused on environmental protection of this fragile eco-system. For example, every year, Live to Love hosts the 'Eco Pad Yatra,‚Äô ('Pad' means 'foot' and 'Yatra' means journeying, 'Pad Yatra' means 'journey on foot') a trek in which hundreds of volunteers hike hundreds of miles collecting plastic waste. Live to Love also plants literally tens of thousands of trees in the region, cleaning the air of toxins and stabilizing the soil. In September 2013, during the UN week, the Gyalwang Drukpa was named 'The Guardian of the Himalayas' by Waterkeeper Alliance, founded in 1999 by environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and several Waterkeeper organisations.Buddhist leader Gyalwang Drukpa named \\"Guardian of the Himalayas\\" alt=Guinness World Records for \\"Most Trees Planted\\" broken in October 2010 and 2012 Guinness World Records for \\"Most Trees Planted\\" broken in Oct 2010 and 2012 In 2010, the Gyalwang Drukpa launched an initiative to plant one million trees in Ladakh, as part of the 'one million trees' campaign initiated by Wangari Maatha√Ø, recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004. As part of this initiative, the Gyalwang Drukpa led the Live to Love volunteers to break the Guinness World Record twice for most trees planted simultaneously. In October 2012, over 9,800 volunteers planted nearly 100,000 trees, safeguarding villages from mudslides and cleaning polluted air.New world record for planting trees in Leh =Education= The people of Ladakh, India, preserve a unique Buddhist lifestyle. As modernization occurs, they are losing their indigenous culture and are having difficulty competing in the new economy. With approximately 1,000 students, the Druk White Lotus School seeks to provide its students a modern education while instilling a respect for the unique indigenous culture of this region. This curriculum includes courses in English and computer skills, as well as the local language and art. The school has won multiple accolades for its sustainable design including three World Architecture Awards and the Inspiring Design Award from the British Council for School Environments. The school has been the subject of an acclaimed PBS documentary (USA),The Druk White Lotus School, Ladakh narrated by Brat Pitt, and has been featured in the Bollywood blockbuster film, '3 Idiots' starring Aamir Khan.3 Idiots school in Ladakh revamped after cloudburst =Medical services= Many remote Himalayan communities lack basic medical services. The Druk White Lotus Clinic, recently opened and operational, is located on Druk Amitabha Mountain outside of Kathmandu, Nepal, and provides regular medical care for the community living on the mountain. At the guidance of the Gyalwang Drukpa Live to Love also hosts temporary medical clinics in Ladakh, India, including an annual eye clinic in which doctors replace the corneas of individuals who have lost sight due to eye disease.Cataract surgery camp held alongside council After a relatively simple surgery, patients who were blind can see. Further, Live to Love seeks to train amchis, practitioners of traditional Himalayan medicine, to provide basic medical care to very remote communities and liaise with allopathic doctors to treat more serious illnesses. =Relief aid= In August 2010, a flash flood from an unexpected cloudburst devastated Ladakh, killing hundreds and leaving thousands homeless. The Gyalwang Drukpa's Live to Love international and domestic volunteers distributed necessities to those in need. They provided nearly 300 units of LPG gas tanks and cooking stoves to displaced families to replace more dangerous portable kerosene stoves. The Druk White Lotus School took in children left homeless because of the flash flood. In light of this disaster, Live to Love seeks to train local Himalayan volunteers in disaster relief expertise in the coming years to provide a rapid, formal response to future events. The Gyalwang Drukpa himself visited, on foot, 50 remote villages affected by the flash flood. =Heritage preservation= The culture and art of Ladakh, India is primarily Buddhist. Because Ladakh is located along the Silk Route, many locations present rare examples of Gandhara and Bamiyan style Buddhist art, which synthesizes Byzantine, Roman-Greco, Scytho-Parthian and Indian elements. Most examples of this style of art have been destroyed in Afghanistan and Pakistan. At the instruction of the Gyalwang Drukpa, Live to Love seeks to preserve this unique art. In addition, Live to Love is beginning an initiative to digitally archive blockprints, manuscripts and texts found in community buildings and homes that reflect and chronicle the culture and history of Ladakh.

Prior to 1978, the \\"Carac√≥is\\" also received following designations: 22 Squadron, Esquadra de Instru√ß√£o Complementar de Pilotagem (EICP) and Esquadra de Instru√ß√£o Complementar de Pilotagem em Avi√µes de Combate (EICPAC). Roles and missions Its primary mission is the complementary flying training on jet aircraft and operational transition training. History The origins of 103 Squadron date back to 1953 with the beginning of the operational service of the Lockheed T-33A Shooting Star and later that same year with the delivery of the first jet fighters, the Republic F-84G Thunderjet, in service with the Portuguese Air Force (PoAF). These aircraft were assigned to then-Air Base No. 2 (BA2), Ota, to equip the first jet fighter squadron, 20 Squadron. That same year a new Flight (Esquadrilha de Voo sem Visibilidade, VSV) was created and integrated in 20 Squadron to train in the flight by instruments and the operational conversion on a twin-seat jet of the new pilots for the single-seat F-84. With the formation of a second jet fighter squadron, 21 Squadron, in 1954, the VSV Flight became more independent. In 1955, 22 Squadron, the third squadron of the 201st Operational Group of Air Base No. 2, was created and equipped with the totality of the existing T-33 fleet and a small detachment of F-84G ‚Äì resulting in the T-33A being finally assigned to an independent squadron of its own. The primary mission of this squadron was to provide the conversion and transition training for jet fighters to pilots who had experience with conventional aircraft, like the Republic F-47D Thunderbolt and Curtiss SB2C Helldiver. This training consisted of about 40 hours of flight in basic flying, acrobatic flying, formation, flight by instruments, navigation, and night flight, and also the conversion to the F-84G before the pilots were assigned to an operational fighter squadron. In 1956, with the complete conversion of the pilots of the last conventional fighter squadron, the 22 Squadron mission was changed from the conversion of pilots to jet fighters, to the instruction of pilots, thus adopting the new designation of Pilot Complementary Instruction Squadron (, EICP). On August 1957, the squadron was then transferred to then-Air Base No. 3 (BA3) and assigned to the PoAF's Directorate of Instruction (DINST). The trainee-pilots where then transferred directly from the Pilot Basic Instruction Squadron (, EIBP), which was equipped with the North American T-6 Texan. The training in T-33A also was changed from 40 to 80 hours of flight and trips of navigation instruction to other countries were added. On December, due to logistic-administrative reasons, the EICP adopted the designation of Combat Aircraft Piloting Complementary Instruction Squadron (, EICPAC), so that the subsidy of operational pilots in jet aircraft was also attributed to the squadron's instructors, also adding to the instruction subsidy. On September 1960, the squadron was transferred back to Ota, and with the disbandment of the 20 and 21 Squadrons, the entire F-84G fleet was also assigned to EICPAC. This resulted in the squadron being organized in two independent Flights, having only the command of the squadron as common between them. The T-33 Flight continued with the mission of complementary instruction while the F-84 Flight had as mission the operational conversion of pilots for the North American F-86F Sabre. However, with the beginning of the conflict in Africa, the F-84 were transferred to new squadrons in the colonies, along with many of its pilot-instructors. On November 1974, the squadron was transferred to Air Base No. 5, in Monte Real; by then with more than 90 hours of flight training. In 1978, with the organic restructure of the Air Force, the squadron's designation is changed to 103 Squadron, while not losing the previous designation of EICPAC. During July 1980, 103 Squadron started to receive the Northrop T-38A Talon, until then operated by 201 Squadron. This resulted in the EICPAC being organized, for the second time, in two independent flights. The T-38 flight was dependent of the Operational Command (COFA) while the T-33 flight continued under the command of the DINST. In 1987, 103 Squadron was transferred to Air Base No. 11, in Beja. On January 1990, the Operational Introduction Course (, CIO) is implemented in the T-38 Flight, to provide operational introduction to the pilots trained in the United States, helping in their integration with the combat squadrons. With the beginning of the retirement of the T-33 in 1988, the T-38 started replacing it in the main course of complementary instruction of combat aircraft. By 1991 the retirement of the T-33 was completed. In 1993, Germany transferred 50 Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jets to Portugal as part payment for German use of Beja Air Base.Mata 2017, p. 87. In June 1993, the T-38 was retired and in November 103 Squadron started its first course on the Alpha Jet. In 1997 the aerobatic team Asas de Portugal reformed with six Alpha Jets as part of 103 Squadron, but the team only carried out two displays before disbanding. A two-aircraft Alpha Jet team, the Parelha da Cruz de Christo (the Cross of Christ Pair) was operated by the squadron in 2001 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Portuguese Air Force, and the Asas de Portugal was reformed as part of 103 Squadron in 2004, continuing to operate until 2010.Mata 2017, pp. 88‚Äì89.

Early life He was born in Paris, in a family of classical musicians. His great-grandfather, Gilbert Duprez was a very well known opera singer. His grandparents were both opera singers, and his mother was a concert pianist who played in big orchestras in France. At the insistence of his mother, he studied economics and social sciences at University in Paris. But as soon as he graduated, he was back making music. He worked professionally as a singer and musician, playing guitar. At the same time he was involved in writing music for television and the cinema. Classical music was a part of his life due to his family background, but it did not fit to his musical expectations. Other than classical music, he was very interested in jazz, easy listening, semi-classical, and pop music. Music career Early years He started a partnership with the French composer, Paul de Senneville in 1968. Soon after, they started to compose many songs together. Their collaboration got well known immediately, and their compositions were recorded by major French singers such as Michel Polnareff, Christophe, Dalida, Petula Clark, Claude Fran√ßois and Mireille Mathieu. They internationally sold more than 100 million records. Olivier Toussaint and Paul de Senneville also got involved in music production business and started up the group \\"Pop Concerto Orchestra\\". In this group, Toussaint was a lead singer. Then they launched a second rock and roll group \\"Anarchic System\\". Over a period of 5 years, both of the groups sold several millions of records. Career development 1975 was the major breakthrough for both Paul de Senneville and Olivier Toussaint with the triumph of \\"Dolannes Melodie\\" which launched the trumpet player Jean-Claude Borelly. They collaborated with the French composer/arranger G√©rard Salesses, in arranging many of titles for Jean-Claude Borelly. In 1976, Paul de Senneville and Olivier Tousaint set up their own record label, Delphine (named after de Senneville's first daughter). Delphine is one of the leading French music exporters to the world market. Soon after in 1976, they discovered Richard Clayderman, and established him as the top French record seller worldwide more than 65 million LPs sold. \\"Ballade pour Adeline\\", composed by Paul de Senneville and Olivier Tousaint, was the first song recorded by Richard Clayderman at Delphine studio, and it sold over 22 million singles in 38 countries through the years 1977 to 1979. In 1977 the synthesizer project By the Savers (Olivier Toussaint together with French musicians Roland Romanelli and Jean Baudlot) released one single Help Me across Europe which didn't chart anywhere. Success The year 1978 was Olivier Toussaint's big success, attending in Mon√©gasque entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1978, and performing the duet \\"Les jardins de Monaco\\" (\\"The Gardens of Monaco\\") with the female singer \\"Caline\\" (pseudonym of Corinne Sauvage). It was succeeded as Monegasque representative at the 1979 Contest by Laurent Vaguener (pseudonym of Jean Baudlot) with \\"Notre Vie C'Est La Musique\\". In 1983, with the song \\"Eden is a magic world\\" (composed by Paul de Senneville), Olivier Toussaint got No.1 in the charts in France, Switzerland and Wallonia, the French speaking part of Belgium. Since then, Olivier Toussaint has been the main manager to Delphine company, looking after over 40 employees and artists. Delphine company is nowadays several groups representing 15 companies dealing with various activities. Besides producing and recording music for several international instrumentalists such as Richard Clayderman, Nicolas de Angelis, and Ocarina group, Delphine activities is in instrumental an advertising film and clip production.

Cebulski is an American writer and editor for Marvel Comics, known for his work on titles such as Marvel Fairy Tales. As of November 2017, he holds the position of editor-in-chief. Early life Chester B. Cebulski is of Polish descent. Since he was 20 years old, C. B. Cebulski has lived off and on in Japan, where members of his family reside. Career 1990s ‚Äì 2000s Cebulski's early career included working as a translator and a freelance writer. Cebulski started his comics career in 1997 editing manga for Central Park Media in New York City, bringing titles such as Record of Lodoss War, Slayers, Plastic Little, Geobreeders, Nadeiscoto, and Kia Asamiya's Dark Angel to U.S. audiences.Rosemann, Bill (January 31, 2002). \\"Marvel adds editor C.B.

Newsarama. In the early 2000s, Cebulski did his first work at Marvel Comics, assisting Associate Editor Brian Smith as a consultant on the Marvel Mangaverse, a line of books that reimagined classic Marvel heroes like Spider-Man and the X-Men in the style of manga (Japanese comics). In January 2002, he was hired full time as an Associate Editor under Ralph Macchio, in part because of his fluency in Japanese and his ability to recruit top artists from Japan to work for Marvel.Elbein, Asher (December 17, 2017). \\"The Secret Identity of Marvel Comics' Editor\\". The Atlantic. As he rose through the ranks, he oversaw the launch of titles such as Runaways, Wolverine: Snikt, and NYX. In 2003, Cebulski created the pseudonym Akira Yoshida, under which he began soliciting work from other companies. His work on the Dark Horse Comics books Conan and Hellboy impressed another Marvel editor who, unaware of Yoshida‚Äôs real identity, asked Cebulski to pitch as well. Cebulski continued to use the pseudonym for a number of Japanese-themed comic books he wrote for Marvel in 2004 and 2005, including Thor: Son Of Asgard, Elektra: The Hand, and several X-Men titles.Andrews, Travis M. (December 19, 2017). \\"The curious tale of the Marvel comics editor who pretended to be a Japanese writer\\". The Washington Post. Cebulski did this to circumvent a company policy prohibiting Marvel's editorial staff from writing or drawing comic books without special permission, or in the case of being granted such permission, being paid for doing so. Before Joe Quesada became Editor-in-chief in 2000, editors used to write comics for other editors' departments, though this was seen as a corrupt practice, since it gave such editors an advantage over other writers. Cebulski created an elaborate backstory for Yoshida, stating in interviews that he was a Japanese man who grew up reading manga, and had discovered American comics when he lived in the United States as a result of his father's career as a traveling businessman. When questioned about whether or not he was actually Yoshida, Cebulski separately claimed to have met Yoshida and cited unspecified office visits and convention appearances. When Cebulski took a position at Marvel that allowed him to openly write as well as edit, Yoshida abruptly disappeared, leading to persistent rumors that Yoshida had been a pseudonym used by a Marvel staffer. When Bleeding Cool's Rich Johnston asked Cebulski in early 2006 if he was Yoshida, Cebulski said he was not. Marvel also denied the rumors, with editor Mike Marts stating that he had lunch with Yoshida when he visited the U.S. Former Marvel staffer Gregg Schigiel stated in a podcast that several people at Marvel knew about the deception, though he did not give the author's real name, and his superiors took no action on the matter. Cebulski was the head writer on the 2006 video game Marvel Ultimate Alliance, which features a character named after him. In a sub-quest, the player needs to recommend one of two hackers to help Weasel hack into S.H.I.E.L.D. files and determine whether the Black Widow is a double agent. One of them is named after Cebulski, and is revealed to be the correct choice, since the other, Beroge, is a squealer.\\"Marvel Promotes C.B Cebulski\\". CBR.com. July 19, 2010.

Cebulski brokered several deals during this tenure, including partnership with the Japan-based publisher Kodansha, the Korea publisher Daum, and China's NetEase.

On November 17, 2017, Cebulski was promoted to Editor-in-chief, succeeding Axel Alonso. After the announcement of his promotion, Image Comics Branding Manager David Brothers challenged comics journalists on Twitter as to why Cebulski \\"chose to use the pen name Akira Yoshida in the early 2000s to write a bunch of Japanese-y books for them,\\" prompting much discussion on social media. Rich Johnston resumed his investigation into the matter, having failed to definitively substantiate the rumors in 2006. On November 28, Bleeding Cool broke the story that Marvel determined that Yoshida was a pseudonym of Cebulski's in 2006 after Johnston reported on Gregg Schigiel's podcast. Cebulski confessed to Marvel executives that in 2003, he had been planning to leave Marvel, and devised the pseudonym to establish himself as a writer for other companies like Dreamwave and Dark Horse, only for another Marvel editor to hire him on the basis of that work. Cebulski publicly admitted to having used the pseudonym Akira Yoshida, leading to accusations of cultural appropriation and yellowfacing because of the stereotypical tropes Cebulski employed in his Yoshida stories, such as ninjas, samurai and yakuza. Comics critic and scholar Kelly Kanayama stated that in those stories, Cebulski \\"presented a vision of Japanese culture that was just different enough to seem exotic, but that aligned with Western biases about what Japanese culture ‚Äî and Japanese people ‚Äî were really like.\\" Cebulski addressed his use of the pseudonym, stating: > I stopped writing under the pseudonym Akira Yoshida after about a year. It > wasn't transparent, but it taught me a lot about writing, communication and > pressure. I was young and na√Øve and had a lot to learn back then.

It also occasionally licenses Western market children's films. Criticism and controversy In 2005, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority issued an order regarding the ban of several non-private channels because programming which should have been dubbed into Urdu or used Urdu subtitles instead used Hindi terms and references blended into the local scripts or the networks carried all-Hindi versions imported from India outright. In early 2010, PEMRA again issued a notice against children's networks and suspended the licenses of Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, disallowing them from broadcasting. In the meantime, the Pakistani government pushed unsuccessfully for PTV or another domestic broadcaster to launch a children's network to replace private broadcasters in order to assure PEMRA compliance with language standards. On 1 August 2011, the Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Firdous Ashiq Awan, announced the restoration of the Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network licenses, allowing their return to the air, though she expressed disappointment that a domestic Pakistani broadcaster would not step up to broadcast children's programming, nor PTV would launch one, and that PEMRA would accommodate the launch any such network. 2016 temporary network suspension and further difficulties In the aftermath of the 2016 Uri attack, PEMRA again focused on Nickelodeon Pakistan as the network had begun to share programming with Nickelodeon India due to cost concerns, both within ARY and Viacom, and felt ARY was shirking off PEMRA's orders in order to economize against their orders; this also included the return of Hindi-blended and all-Hindi content to the Nickelodeon Pakistan schedule since their 2011 return to the air. The regulatory authority ordered a ban of the broadcasting of all Indian-originated media after 19 October, though PEMRA ruled that ARY Group had disregarded the order and continued to air imported programming with Hindi language content from Nickelodeon India during the restricted period. The network's license to broadcast was suspended on 31 October, with local providers pulling the network on PEMRA's orders. Shortly thereafter, on 10 November, a stay from the Sindh High Court effectively nullified the PEMRA order and allowed Nickelodeon's return to the air, stating the body had no authority for the suspension without a comprehensive explanation. ARY also stated that the ruling PML-N party had used the regulatory power of PEMRA to oppose its networks due to its differing political opinions from the PML-N. On 27 April 2017, the network carried an episode of Winx Club which featured a scene of what PEMRA alleged was an \\"indecently dressed\\" character, violating the body's 2015 Electronic Media Code of Conduct. After a month of appeals, PEMRA issued ARY a fine of ‚Ç®500,000 and warned the network against any further violations.Report PEMRA. Retrieved 10 December 2017.

When pure, it is a colorless white powder. The single crystals of LaBr3 are hexagonal crystals with melting point of 783 ¬∞C. It is highly hygroscopic and water-soluble. There are several hydrates, La3Br¬∑x H2O, of the salt also known. It is often used as a source of lanthanum in chemical synthesis and as a scintillation material in certain applications. Lanthanum bromide scintillation detector The scintillator material cerium activated lanthanum bromide (LaBr3:Ce) was first produced in 2001. LaBr3:Ce-based radiation detectors offer improved energy resolution, fast emission and excellent temperature and linearity characteristics. Typical energy resolution at 662 keV is 3% as compared to sodium iodide detectors at 7%.Knoll, Glenn F., Radiation Detection and Measurement 3rd ed. (Wiley, New York, 2000). The improved resolution is due to a photoelectron yield that is 160% greater than is achieved with sodium iodide. Another advantage of LaBr3:Ce is the nearly flat photo emission over a 70 ¬∞C temperature range (~1% change in light output). Today LaBr3 detectors are offered with bialkali photomultiplier tubes (PMT) that can be two inches in diameter and 10 or more inches long . However, miniature packaging can be obtained by the use of a silicon drift detector (SDD) or a Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM).A. Dawood Butt et al., \\"Comparison of SiPM and SDD based readouts of 1‚Ä≥ LaBr3:Ce scintillator for nuclear physics applications,\\" 2015 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC), San Diego, CA, 2015, pp. 1-4. doi: 10.1109/NSSMIC.2015.7581734 These UV enhanced diodes provide excellent wavelength matching to the 380 nm emission of LaBr3. The SDD is not as sensitive to temperature and bias drift as PMT. The reported spectroscopy performance of the SDD configuration resulted in a 2.8% energy resolution at 662 keV for the detector sizes considered. LaBr3 introduces an enhanced set of capabilities to a range of gamma spectroscopy radioisotope detection and identification systems used in the homeland security market. Isotope identification utilizes several techniques (known as algorithms) which rely on the detector's ability to discriminate peaks. The improvements in resolution allow more accurate peak discrimination in ranges where isotopes often have many overlapping peaks. This leads to better isotope classification. Screening of all types (pedestrians, cargo, conveyor belts, shipping containers, vehicles, etc.) often requires accurate isotopic identification to differentiate concerning materials from non-concerning materials (medical isotopes in patients, naturally occurring radioactive materials, etc.) Heavy R&D; and deployment of instruments utilizing LaBr3 is expected in the upcoming years.

In 1992, the revenue generated from banana sales amounted to US$287 million and along with the coffee industry accounted for some 50% of exports. Honduras produced 861,000 tons of bananas in 1999. The two corporations, Chiquita Brands International and the Dole Food Company are responsible for most Honduran banana production and exports. History Honduras began exporting bananas in the late nineteenth century, and the trade grew rapidly. Initially, in the 1870s most banana production was confined to the Bay Islands, serious production did not begin on the mainland until about 1880.John Soluri, Banana Culture: Agriculture, Consumption, and Environmental Change in Honduras and the United States (Austin: University of Texas Press: 2005), pp. 18-23 The US consul reported that in 1894 goods worth almost $350,000 were exported to the United States through Puerto Cort√©s, the region's main port, and by 1903 exports had almost tripled to over $900,000. Much of these exports came from the growing banana trade; between 1894 and 1903 the trade had grown almost four-fold from somewhat over 600,000 stems to over two million. Shipping capacity increased as well, from four steamers a month to the United States, to 18. The choice of US destination ports expanded from just New Orleans to include Mobile, Philadelphia and Boston.United States Monthly Consular and Trade Reports vols 75, nos 283-285 (Washington, DC, 1904) p. 1096. The initial growth in trade was from local banana growers. An 1899 census showed northern Honduras had some 1,000+ people in the region between Puerto Cort√©s and La Ceiba (and as far inland as San Pedro Sula) growing bananas, most of them on small holdings.Soluri, Banana Culture, pp. 23-25. This numerous class was able to expand production, take over communal lands and win the political struggle with cattle ranchers over land control in the early decades of the twentieth century.Soluri, Banana Culture, pp. 27-29. In the early years of the industry, banana growers delivered their fruit to the coast where steamers from a variety of US-based shippers purchased them. However, the steamship companies gradually merged until only a handful remained, and these were soon dominated by the Vaccaro brothers of New Orleans, who in 1899 founded the Standard Fruit and Steamship Company which eventually became Dole. Because northern Honduras had a poorly developed transportation network, only farms located along major streams, and the few existing railroads in the immediate vicinity of the coast could viably participate in the export trade. Thus, the steamship companies needed to invest in a local infrastructure of railroads that would expand the area available for cultivation. By 1902 local railroad lines were being constructed on the Caribbean coast to accommodate expanding banana production.Soluri, Banana Culture pp. 40-42. The Honduran government, operating on Liberal economic policies that had been in place since 1876, made significant concessions of land and tax exemption to anyone who would open up agricultural land. While some Honduran producers were able to take advantage of these opportunities, the most significant concessions went to US-based companies that had the capital to purchase and develop land quickly.Glen Chambers,Race, Nation, and West Indian Immigration to Honduras, 1890-1940(Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2010), pp. 19, 25-26. Companies like the Tela Railroad Company were granted land concessions in exchange for building railroad lines. In its 1912 concession, the Tela Railroad Company received 6,000 hectares of national land (that is land that was deemed vacant) for every 12 kilometers of track they laid, on the route from Tela to El Progresso, laid out in alternate blocks on both sides of the rail lines.Soluri, Banana Culture pp. 43-45.Mario Argueta Banana y politica: Samuel Zemurray y la Cuyamel Fruit Company, pp. 24-37 After the first concessions in 1912, US concerns achieved more or less complete control of the productive alluvial plains of Honduras' Atlantic coast. The area around Puerto Cort√©s was dominated by the Cuyamel Fruit Company, the La Ceiba region by Standard Fruit, and Tela and Trujillo were controlled by United Fruit's subsidiaries, the Tela Railroad Company and the Trujillo Railroad Company.Chambers, Race, Nation, pp. 28-31. By 1929, the United Fruit Company operated in over of the country and controlled the major ports. Initially, Honduran producers focused on growing the Gros Michel type of bananas, which had important characteristics that made them easy to store and ship and appealed to consumers in North American markets. However in the early 1920s banana-producing areas began suffering from a blight known as the \\"Panama Disease\\" which, combined with soil exhaustion from monocrop agriculture, led to a production decline in many parts of northern Honduras. The companies sought to restore production by rerouting railroads and renegotiating concessions so to bring more virgin land into cultivation. In addition they began to replace the Gros Michel with the Cavendish variety, which had some resistance to the disease.Soluri, Banana Culture, pp. 51-60. Political Implications General Sierra's efforts to perpetuate himself in office led to his overthrow in 1903 by General Manuel Bonilla, who proved to be an even greater ally of the banana companies than Sierra had been. Companies gained exemptions from taxes and permission to construct wharves and roads, as well as permission to improve interior waterways and to obtain charters for new railroad construction. At one time the American government trained the Honduran army and air force to protect the supremacy of the banana companies operating in the country. The growth of banana production in Honduras soon saw the industry constituting some 88% of Honduran exports at its all-time peak, centering the economic activity of the country almost entirely on the Atlantic coast region, with the economic center at the coastal city of San Pedro Sula rather than Tegucigalpa. Location of Trujillo and the Bay Islands as the centre of Honduran coastal banana production The Honduran banana industry employed a significant Garifuna workforce from the Bay Islands off Trujillo and in 1901 the government gave concessions for them to use over 7,000 hectares for banana cultivation. However in practice it was impossible to protect all of this land for its given purpose and corruption saw a local military commander in Trujillo, Colonel Gustavo Alvarez, squander 2,000 hectares of land allocated to the Garifuna and give the land to the wealthy landowners. In 1964, Castle & Cooke bought out the Standard Fruit Company, and concentrated on the production of bananas and pineapples under the Dole label in Honduras. In September 1974, Hurricane Fifi devastated some 60% of Honduras' agricultural production, and many of the plantations had to be abandoned, seriously affecting the economy. In response, the redundant plantation workers formed the Las Isletas Peasants Enterprise, where they harvested the bananas independently and reaped the profits, producing one million boxes of bananas in 1976 and four million in 1977. Las Isletas attempted to sell the fruit directly through the Union of Banana Exporting Countries at one stage, resulting in the arrest of 200 militant members of Las Isletas and a raid on the association's headquarters under pressure from the Standard Fruit Company, who feared being outlawed by the process. In the mid-1990s, the Honduran economy went into severe recession, which hit the banana and coffee industries hard and sending world prices soaring. Although the economy recovered significantly in 1996, the banana industry in Honduras was struck hard by the lasting impression of Hurricane Mitch in late 1998, a Category Five Hurricane considered the worst in 200 years, with winds reaching and inundating land with excessive precipitation drowning many of the crops. Hurricane Mitch is believed to have destroyed over 50%, possibly as high as 80%, of the banana and coffee crops in 1998, costing an estimated $3 billion in damage. Since 2000 the industry has recovered, although the country is still one of the poorest in Central America. In 2003, the News Scientist reported that global banana production was under threat by disease and may be wiped out within ten years if preventative measures are not taken to protect against it. Scientists from the banana industry in Honduras responded to the potential crisis by implementing new large-scale breeding schemes in a new FHIA variety. This FHIA banana crop is resistant to major diseases and pests, but is also highly productive and efficient. The scheme in Honduras is financed by the multinational United Brands.

Only Phillips had appeared on the radio version ‚Äì all other parts were recast.Hello: The Autobiography, Leslie Phillips, Orion, 2006 The film was produced at Walton-on-Thames. Plot Captain Povey has built a reputation for shutting down redundant naval bases, and now has his eye on the minesweeping detachment on Boonzey Island (55.5 miles from Portsmouth, a Channel Island). Arriving on inspection, he is told tales of finding many mines in the sea there and, not believing them, goes out in the minesweeper HMS Compton (played by HMS Reedham). The crew were supposed to find \\"Bessy\\", a mine-shaped object used to collect Lifeboat funds but found a real mine instead, which Pouter bashes about in an effort to take it apart. Released, it explodes nearby and this convinces Povey that the incompetents there are not up to the job and he decides on using a competent crew to do the job. Chief Petty Officer Banyard uses his \\"Pullson's Fulminator Mark III\\" trick (it does not exist) to delay their decommissioning and what started off as a thin folder goes around the military offices and comes back to Povey's office as a mountain of paper work. He sees through it and goes back to the island only to be told there has been an outbreak of \\"Yellow Fever\\" there. He is taken in and leaves but decides to return and the trick is revealed as life is back to normal there. Now more than ever he is determined to shut them all down. Gaston Higgins, a Frenchman, owns the local bar and when he gets drunk he talks of revolution and kicking the British off the island. They decide to use him and say they are under siege from revolutionaries. Povey knows this is another trick and officially gives them three days to leave the island, but his bosses and the government believe the story when they get reports from a reporter, Lieutenant Binns, who was sent there to take photographs. Questions are asked by the British and French governments and Povey's career is on the line as he is told to sort this out as the British do not run from the French. Povey goes to the island and a fake attack on Gaston and his men is launched but Povey finds out it was all a hoax. Ready to hand out court martials all round, Povey is confronted with a picture Binns took of him leading an all-out attack on what is now known to be a hoax, which will be front-page news across the world tomorrow. Stanton talks him into seeing sense and Povey, with his career in tatters if it gets out, tears up his report. He leaves and life goes back to normal on the island. On the way back to Portsmouth, their boat hits another real sea mine and Povey, Binns and the others are left to swim back to base.

Pertwee noted that the film \\"bombed\\" and believed that this was due to the fact that audiences did not consider the film to be The Navy Lark due to the absence of himself, Price and fellow radio series cast member Stephen Murray. A nod to the radio series appears during the fake revolution in the news headlines of The Daily Telegraph referring to \\"Admiral Troutbridge\\".

He is a writer of fact-based narrative nonfiction works as well as historical nonfiction based on individual, first-hand accounts. As a sculptor, he designed and created the Kentucky Medal of Honor Memorial in Louisville, KY, and the Texas Medal of Honor Memorial in Gainesville, TX. Doyle Glass Biography Glass was born and raised in Midland, Texas. the fifth generation of a pioneer West Texas ranching family. He developed a life-long passion for writing and art. After graduating from Midland High School in 1980, Glass attended Southern Methodist University in Dallas where he obtained a BA in history. In 1988, he graduated from Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law with a Juris Doctor degree. In the early 1990s, Glass worked as an assistant district attorney in McLennan County, Texas and Bell County, Texas. In 1994, he moved to Kentucky and began work as a special prosecutor with the Kentucky Attorney General's office. In 2001, he left the practice of law and began work as an author, historian, and sculptor. In 2015, he returned to his native Texas and now resides in Dallas. Glass‚Äô greatest pride is being a loving husband to his wife Somer and father to his son Jake and daughters Atty and Myra Lee. Sculptor In 2000, he conceived of and sculpted the Kentucky Medal of Honor Memorial , a bronze statue of John Squires, a Kentucky recipient of the Medal of Honor in WWII. The statue stands in downtown Louisville, and serves as a reminder of the sacrifices of heroes from Kentucky who have fought and died for freedom. In 2008, he designed and sculpted the Texas Medal of Honor Memorial.Texas Medal of Honor Memorial a bronze statue of Midland native George O‚ÄôBrien, who earned the Medal of Honor during the Korean War. The memorial, soon to be part of the Texas Medal of Honor Museum in Gainesville, stands as a symbol of all Texans who have earned our nation's highest award for combat valor. Author and Historian Inspired by Stephen Ambrose's book-turned-HBO miniseries Band of Brothers, Glass began writing historical narrative nonfiction. in 2007, Glass wrote Lions of Medina, a true, first-hand account of the Marines of Charlie Company 1/1 during the Vietnam War. The work is based on individual interviews with the survivors of Operation Medina in 1967. It was first published by Coleche Press in 2007, and subsequently published by NAL Caliber Penguin in 2008. His second book, Swift Sword, was published in 2014. It tells the story of Marines who endured a twenty-four hour fire-fight on a lone knoll in the Que Son Valley during the Vietnam War. As with Lions of Medina, the work is based on interviews with survivors of Operation Swift in 1967. Glass' next book, Benoist's War, is based on the life of Robert Benoist, a French racing champion in Grand Prix and Le Mans in the 1920s and 30s. Benoist became a secret agent and saboteur in Nazi occupied France for the British Special Operations Executive during WWII. Writing from the point of view of Benoist, Glass will combine creative storytelling with historical fact in order to place the reader in the skin of the man who risked everything to free France of the Nazi menace.

The three line segments inside the triangle are the triangle's medians, each bisecting a side. The medians coincide at the triangle's centroid, which is also the center of the Steiner ellipse. In geometry, the Steiner ellipse of a triangle, also called the Steiner circumellipse to distinguish it from the Steiner inellipse, is the unique circumellipse (ellipse that touches the triangle at its vertices) whose center is the triangle's centroid.Weisstein, Eric W. \\"Steiner Circumellipse.\\" From MathWorld‚ÄîA Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SteinerCircumellipse.html Named after Jakob Steiner, it is an example of a circumconic. By comparison the circumcircle of a triangle is another circumconic that touches the triangle at its vertices, but is not centered at the triangle's centroid unless the triangle is equilateral. The area of the Steiner ellipse equals the area of the triangle times frac{4 pi}{3sqrt{3}}, and hence is 4 times the area of the Steiner inellipse. The Steiner ellipse has the least area of any ellipse circumscribed about the triangle. The Steiner ellipse is the scaled Steiner inellipse (factor 2, center is the centroid). Hence both ellipses are similar (have the same eccentricity).  Properties  Steiner ellipse of an equilateral (left) and isosceles triangle * A Steiner ellipse is the only ellipse, whose center is the centroid S of a triangle ABC and contains the points A,B,C. The area of the Steiner ellipse is tfrac{4 pi}{3sqrt{3}}-fold of the triangle's area. ;Proof: A) For an equilateral triangle the Steiner ellipse is the circumcircle, which is the only ellipse, that fulfills the preconditions. The desired ellipse has to contain the triangle reflected at the center of the ellipse. This is true for the circumcircle. A conic is uniquely determined by 5 points. Hence the circumcircle is the only Steiner ellipse. B) Because an arbitrary triangle is the affine image of an equilateral triangle, a circle is the affine image of the unit circle and the centroid of a triangle is mapped onto the centroid of the image triangle, the property (a unique circumellipse with the centroid as center) is true for any triangle. The area of the circumcircle of an equilateral triangle is tfrac{4 pi}{3sqrt{3}}-fold of the area of the triangle. An affine map preserves the ratio of areas. Hence the statement on the ratio is true for any triangle and its Steiner ellipse.  Determination of conjugate points  An ellipse can be drawn (by computer or by hand), if besides the center at least two conjugate points on conjugate diameters are known. In this case * either one determines by Rytz's construction the vertices of the ellipse and draws the ellipse with a suitable ellipse compass *or uses an parametric representation for drawing the ellipse. 500pxthumbSteps for determining congugate points on a Steiner ellipse: 1) transformation of the triangle onto an isosceles triangle 2) determination of point D which is conjugate to C (steps 1‚Äì5) 3) drawing the ellipse with conjugate half diameters SC, SD Let be ABC a triangle and its centroid S. The shear mapping with axis d through S and parallel to AB transforms the triangle onto the isosceles triangle A'B'C' (see diagram). Point C' is a vertex of the Steiner ellipse of triangle A'B'C'. A second vertex D of this ellipse lies on d, because d is perpendicular to SC' (symmetry reasons). This vertex can be determined from the data (ellipse with center S through C' and B', A'B'=c) by calculation. It turns out that :SD=frac{c}{sqrt{3}} . Or by drawing: Using de la Hire's method (see center diagram) vertex D of the Steiner ellipse of the isosceles triangle A'B'C' is determined. The inverse shear mapping maps C' back to C and point D is fixed, because it is a point on the shear axis. Hence semi diameter SD is conjugate to SC. With help of this pair of conjugate semi diameters the ellipse can be drawn, by hand or by computer.  Parametric representation and equation  Steiner ellipse of a triangle including the axes and verices (purple) Given: Triangle  A=(a_1,a_2),; B=(b_1,b_2), ; C=(c_1,c_2) Wanted: Parametric representation and equation of its Steiner ellipse The centroid of the triangle is  S=(tfrac{a_1+b_1+c_1}{3},tfrac{a_2+b_2+c_2}{3}) . Parametric representation: From the investigation of the previous section one gets the following parametric representation of the Steiner ellipse: * vec x =vec p(t)=overrightarrow{OS}; +; overrightarrow{SC}; cos t ;+; frac{1}{sqrt{3}}overrightarrow{AB}; sin t ; , quad 0le t <2pi ; . * The four vertices of the ellipse are quad vec p(t_0),; vec p(t_0pmfrac{pi}{2}),; vec p(t_0+pi), where t_0 comes from :: cot (2t_0)= frac{vec f_1^{, 2}-vec f_2^{, 2}}{2vec f_1 cdot vec f_2}quad with quad vec f_1=vec{SC},quad vec f_2=frac{1}{sqrt{3}}vec{AB} quad (see ellipse). The roles of the points for determining the parametric representation can be changed. Example (see diagram): A=(-5,-5),B=(0,25), C=(20,0). Steiner ellipse as example for \\"equation\\" Equation: If the origin is the centroid of the triangle (center of the Steiner ellipse) the equation corresponding to the parametric representation vec x=vec f_1 cos t + vec f_2 sin t is * (xf_{2y} - yf_{2x})^2 + (yf_{1x} - xf_{1y})^2 - (f_{1x}f_{2y} - f_{1y}f_{2x})^2 =0  , with  vec f_i=(f_{ix},f_{iy})^T  .CDKG: Computerunterst√ºtzte Darstellende und Konstruktive Geometrie (TU Darmstadt) (PDF; 3,4 MB), p. 65. Example: The centroid of triangle quad A=(-tfrac{3}{2}sqrt{3},-tfrac{3}{2}), B=(tfrac{sqrt{3}}{2},-tfrac{3}{2}), C=(sqrt{3},3)quad is the origin. From the vectors vec f_1=(sqrt{3},3)^T, vec f_2=(2,0)^T  one gets the equation of the Steiner ellipse: :9x^2+7y^2-6sqrt{3} xy-36=0  .  Determination of the semi-axes and linear eccentricity  If the vertices are already known (see above), the semi axes can be determined. If one is interested in the axes and eccentricity only, the following method is more appropriate: Let be a,b,; a>b the semi axes of the Steiner ellipse. From Apollonios theorem on properties of conjugate semi diameters of ellipses one gets: : a^2+b^2=vec{SC}^2+vec{SD}^2  , quad acdot b= leftdet(vec{SC},vec{SD})right  . Denoting the right hand sides of the equations by M and N respectively and transforming the non linear system (respecting a>b>0) leads to: :a^2+b^2=M , ab=N quad rightarrow quad a^2+2ab+b^2=M+2N , a^2-2ab+b^2=M-2N : rightarrowquad (a+b)^2=M+2N , (a-b)^2=M-2N quad rightarrowquad a+b=sqrt{M+2N} , a-b=sqrt{M-2N} . Solving for a and b one gets the semi axes: *  a=frac{1}{2}(sqrt{M+2N}+sqrt{M-2N})  , qquad b=frac{1}{2}(sqrt{M+2N}-sqrt{M-2N}) , with qquad M= vec{SC}^2+frac{1}{3}vec{AB}^2 , quad N= frac{1}{sqrt{3}} det(vec{SC},vec{AB})qquad . The linear eccentricity of the Steiner ellipse is * c=sqrt{a^2-b^2}=cdots=sqrt{sqrt{M^2-4N^2}} . and the area *:F=pi ab=pi N=frac{pi}{sqrt{3}} leftdet(vec{SC},vec{AB})right One should not confuse a,b in this section with other meanings in this article ! Trilinear equation The equation of the Steiner circumellipse in trilinear coordinates is :bcyz+cazx+abxy=0 for side lengths a, b, c.  Alternative calculation of the semi axes and linear eccentricity  The semi-major and semi-minor axes have lengths :frac{1}{3}sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2 pm 2Z}, and focal length :frac{2}{3}sqrt{Z} where :Z=sqrt{a^4+b^4+c^4-a^2b^2-b^2c^2-c^2a^2}. The foci are called the Bickart points of the triangle.

The tradition of distributing Patoleo to neighbours and friends after the arrival of a new born in the family is still retained by some Goans. In bygone times, Patoleo were also distributed to mark the completion of construction of a house in Goa. Some Goan Catholic families send Patoleo to a house where people are mourning the death of a family member. Until modern medicine, Patoleo was often used to help children with whooping cough.

It was established in 1966 as a segregation academy in response to the racial integration of public schools.  History  Wake Christian Academy was established in 1966 by a group of segregationists that included L. C. Purdy, a former president of White Citizens' Councils. Purdy, along with the White Citizens' Council, tried to raise funds in time to open a school building in the fall of 1966, but fell short and had to lease a residence in which to operate the school. School board president H.W. Carey, referencing the founding of the school, told the News & Observer that he \\"hope[ed] the school would be known for its quality education, but it would be false if I said integration didn't enter into it\\". In 1969, Purdy told a reporter that \\"all you get in public schools is integration, not education. The children are pawns in sociological experiments\\". Principal Franklin Pierce said that although the school was formed to maintain segregation, she was seeking to change the school's image. In 1970, North Carolina Supreme Court justice I. Beverly Lake Jr. gave a speech to students and parents at the school in which he denounced school desegregation. Lake noted \\"the products of jungles\\" were enrolling in public education and opined that all white private schools like Wake Christian Academy \\"offer to our state her best hope for safe passage through perilous times.\\" In May 1970, School founder L. C. Purdy was also a leader of the local chapter of the White Citizens Council and campaigned against a public school bond issue on the grounds the funds would \\"be used more integration than for education\\". In 1971, L. C. Purdy, by then a member of board of directors, told a reporter that no black students had applied and that he was not sure if the school would admit a black student. In 1973, Wake Christian Academy's tax exempt status was revoked after a federal court found that the school would not admit black students. In response to the ruling, board member L. C. Purdy commented \\"we are not going let the federal government dictate our admissions policies, even if it means losing our tax exempt status\\".

He is best known for his intensely manipulated prints that display a distinct painterly quality. Life Early years (1859‚Äì1875) L√©on-Robert Demachy was born in the home of his grandmother in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, on the outskirts of Paris, on 7 July 1859. His parents, Charles Adolphe Demachy (1818‚Äì1888) and Zo√© Girod de l‚ÄôAin (1827‚Äì1916), had two other sons, Charles Am√©d√©e (1852‚Äì1911) and Adrien √âdouard (1854‚Äì1927), and a daughter, Germaine (1856-1940?). The elder Charles had started the highly successful financial enterprise of Banque Demachy, and by the time Demachy was born the family was very wealthy. He had no need to earn a living, and there is no record of his having ever been employed anywhere. He dropped the first part of his name in his childhood and was always known as \\"Robert\\". After his birth his family returned to their mansion at 13 Rue Fran√ßois Premier in Paris, where Demachy continued to live for the next fifty years. His early years were quite idyllic, and each year his family would spend several months at their summer villa near Villers-sur- Mer in Normandy. The rest of the year he was educated in Jesuit schools in Paris, and he became fluent in English by the time he was a teenager. His education also included extensive musical lessons, and he became an accomplished violin player. About 1870, Demachy, his mother and his siblings left Paris for Brussels due to the increasing dangers of the Franco-Prussian War. His father stayed in Paris as part of the Commune and the Banque Demachy played an important role in financing the resistance efforts. When he turned eighteen Demachy briefly served a year as an army volunteer, but he soon returned to his life of comfort. In the mid-1870s he began frequenting the artists‚Äô caf√©s and, perhaps in rebellion to his gentrified life, he became involved in the growing bohemian culture that was beginning to take hold in Paris. He began making sketches of caf√© patrons and people on the street, a practice he continued throughout his life. Seminal years (1876‚Äì1899) Sometime in the late 1870s he began experimenting with photography. It‚Äôs not known what or who influenced him to become involved, but he could devote as much time and money to this endeavor as he wanted and he quickly became highly proficient with a camera. For the next thirty years he devoted all of his time to both taking photographs and writing extensively about photography. Study in Red - Published in Camera Notes, Vol. 2, No 1, July 1898 In 1882 Demachy was elected to the Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de photographie, where he interacted with some of the leading photographers in Europe. Within a few years he became frustrated with the conservative views of many of the photographers around him, and in 1888 he joined with Maurice Bucquet to form the new Photo-Club de Paris. The members of the Photo-Club advocated the aesthetics of Pictorialist photography, and soon the Photo-Club was playing a similar role in France as that of the Photo-Secession in the U.S. In 1889, while visiting the Exposition Universelle in Paris, he met a young woman from Detroit, Michigan, named Julia Adelia Delano. Adelia, as she was called, was a member of the important Delano family in America and a distant relative of future American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Little is known about their courtship, but on 2 May 1893 Robert and Adelia were married in Paris. They lived in the family mansion on Rue Fran√ßois Premier. Their first son, Robert-Charles, was born in 1894, followed by son Jacques Fran√ßois in 1898. Jacques later became a very well known fashion illustrator About 1890 Demachy became one of the first Frenchmen to own an automobile, a Panhard. He owned four of these vehicles throughout his life, keeping the same model until it was old enough to become a classic car. In 1894 he began to use the gum bichromate printing process recently introduced by A. Rouill√©-Ladev√®ze at the Paris Salon. He developed a style that relied upon heavy manipulation of the image both during the development of the negative and again while printing. As he experimented with the process he wrote about his findings and about the aesthetics of the gum print, helping to popularize it among French photographers. Later that year he, along with Constant Puyo, Le Begue and Bucquet, helped organize the first Paris Salon founded on the artistic principles of the Photo-Club de Paris. In 1895 he had his first exhibition of gum prints at the Photo-Club de Paris. This helped to promote his increasingly international status, and later that same year he was elected to The Linked Ring in London. In 1897 he published his first book, with co-author Alfred Maskell, Photo-aquatint or Gum Bichromate Process (London: Hazell, Watson & Vinery) In 1898 he began corresponding with Stieglitz, often complaining about the lack of true artistic photography in France. The two would continue writing each other for more than fifteen years. Master photographer (1900‚Äì1913) During the first decade of the 20th century Demachy continued his extensive writing about photography, and he soon became one of the prolific writers about photography even to this day. Over his lifetime he wrote more than one thousand articles on the aesthetics and techniques of manipulated prints. During this same period Demachy had five exhibitions at the Royal Photographic Society in London: * April 1901: 67 gum bichromate prints * June 1904: 80 gum bichromate prints (his first one-man show) * July 1907: ‚Äúa small collection‚Äù of his experiments with the Rawlins oil process * July 1910: ‚Äúa series of photographs from the past six months‚Äù * July 1911: ‚Äúa collection of oil transfer prints‚Äù At this time a one-man show was a great honor for any photographer, and to have five within a single decade was unprecedented. The critic A.J. Anderson wrote ‚Äúof a truth, Robert Demachy is not a man, he is a miracle.‚Äù The Seine at Clichy - Published in Camera Work, No 16, October 1906 Each of these shows marked a new high point in his career, and at each he gave an opening address to the membership of the Society. He greatly enjoyed talking about both the technical and aesthetic aspects of his work, and he took advantage of every opportunity to engage other photographers in serious discussions the progress of photography as an art form. In 1904 six of his photographs, three photogravures and three half- tones were published in Alfred Stieglitz‚Äôs famous journal Camera Work, accompanied by a review by Joseph Keiley. These images were seen by American photographer Anne Brigman, who wrote to Stieglitz that they had a serious influence on her own work. This same year he began experimenting with the Rawlins oil process, a relatively new printing method that allowed extensive reworking of the image. This change allowed him to further blend the aesthetics of a painter with those of a photographer. In his many writings Demachy took great care to point out that just knowing how to use the technique of image manipulation was not enough to automatically make a photograph a work of art. A true artistic photographer, he said, must know \\"where to put the accents, where to reduce detail and where to subdue or emphasize form, rather than how to do it.\\" In 1905 Demachy was elected to the Royal Photographic Society. At the invitation of the Society, he and Puyo selected the French entries for the London Photographic Salon that year, and he included more than twenty of his own images in the show. About 1906 he abandoned gum-bichromate printing altogether in favor of oil printing. With Puyo he wrote and published Proc√©d√©s d‚Äôart en photographie (Paris: Photo-Club de Paris). He continued to explore further ways to manipulate his images, and by 1911 he had perfected the modern bromoil process. This allowed him to become even bolder in his visual style, and soon his works attracted a broad international audience. Over the next two years he exhibited in Paris, Vienna and New York, as well as London. By 1907 Demachy was so absorbed in his photography that he had a separate studio and living quarters for himself in the upper floor of the family mansion. His wife Adelia had her own quarters on the ground floor, and their children were looked after by an Irish nanny. This situation led to increasing resentment by Adelia, since she was surrounded by Demachy‚Äôs mother, her in-laws and her children in their mansion yet she rarely saw her husband because of his preoccupation with photography. In addition, Adelia thoroughly enjoyed the aristocratic culture surrounding the Demachy family. There were many opportunities to attend elegant parties and events, but for the most part Robert detested them. He preferred the company of bohemian painters or the enjoyment of the simple countryside, and he was not comfortable in higher class social circles. Adelia became more and more isolated, and in 1909 she asked for and was granted a divorce. After the divorce, which was considered scandalous at that time, she moved to her own apartment and remarried two years later. It is reported that Demachy never spoke an unkind word about her either while they were married or after their divorce. Late life (1914‚Äì1936) Without notice or explanation, Demachy suddenly gave up taking photographs in early 1914. He never again touched a camera, even refusing to take snapshots of his grandchildren. No one was ever able to extract any reason from him for this sudden change, and it remains a mystery to this day. The timing of his decision coincides with the beginning of World War I in Europe, but there is no indication that he was adversely affected by these events. He continued to make sketches, and at one point he reported that he was amused that he had been questioned as a possible spy when he was drawing pictures near Le Havre. He also exhibited some photographs after 1914 and occasionally wrote brief articles. When his mother died in 1916, Demachy finally sold the mansion and moved into an apartment at 12 Cit√© Malesherbes in the old artists' quarter of Montmartre. He also bought a small farm near Hennequeville, near Trouville. He was looked after at both homes by a married butler and housekeeper pair. His only other companions were several Alsatian dogs. Eventually he moved completely to the farm, where he enjoyed the simple life he preferred. His only artistic endeavor for the rest of his life was driving his classic car to the beach where he made sketches of heavy- set women swimmers in the water. Demachy died of arteriole sclerosis in Hennequeville, Normandy, on 29 December 1936. He was buried two days later in the family tomb at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Just before his death he destroyed most of his sketches and gave any remaining photographs to the Royal Photographic Society and the Photo-Club de Paris. The Banque Demachy still exists today but is no longer connected to the original family. The family mansion at 13 Rue Fran√ßois Premier was for many years the Paris headquarters of Christian Dior.

The technology relies on strongly coupled based on resonant inductive coupling caused by electromagnetic resonators, a principle similar to the way a trained singer can shatter a glass using his/her voice. At the receiving resonator's natural frequency, energy is absorbed efficiently, just as a glass absorbs acoustic energy at its natural frequency. At the wall socket, power is put into magnetic fields at a transmitting resonator - basically an antenna. The receiving resonator is tuned to efficiently absorb energy from the magnetic field, whereas nearby objects do not.  Benefits  With this technology enabled in a laptop, for example, batteries could be recharged when the laptop gets within several feet of the transmit resonator.  History  Resonant magnetic power transfer was pioneered by Nikola Tesla. Some of his later Tesla coils use a loosely coupled resonant magnetic power system. The lower coil was energised, and this transferred power via magnetic resonance to the resonant top coil where the high voltage was generated. This was predominantly done to avoid arcing and permit higher voltages. For power supply for more everyday uses the technology is based on principles of WiTricity proposed by Marin Soljaƒçiƒá, a physicist at MIT. Intel chief technology officer Justin Rattner demonstrated powering a light bulb without the use of a plug or wire of any kind as he spoke at the California firm's annual developers forum in San Francisco 2008-08-21. Electricity was sent wirelessly to a lamp on stage, lighting a 60 watt light bulb that uses more power than a typical laptop computer.  Principles In a resonating system, the quality of the resonance is determined by its Q factor; 2 Pi times the ratio of the energy in the resonant circuit divided by its loss per cycle. When two non resonating coils are placed some distance apart, some fraction of the magnetic field from one coil couples into the second, and so changes in the magnetic field of one coil generates a voltage at the other (in accordance with Faraday's law of induction), however little of the energy will couple because most of the field will miss the receiver. The fraction of the field that does couple is called the coupling coefficient. However, it may be seen that if some energy is placed in a 'sender' coil when it is in resonance then the coil will ring for a number of cycles before losing the energy to its resistance. Provided the Q of the transmitting circuit is high enough to overcome the coupling coefficient, then most of the power can eventually be absorbed by the receiving coil over several cycles and can be tapped off. The remaining power will be lost in the resistance of the sender, and some in the receiver coil also.

It was the first of many trunkline bridges designed by the Michigan State Highway Department. It was built in 1914, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description Trunk Line Bridge No. 1 is a multiple-span concrete bridge which is located east of Michigamme. The bridge used to carry US 41/M-28 across the Pesheskee River near the river's mouth at Lake Michigamme. It is located between a Soo Line Railroad (ex-Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway) bridge to the south and the modern replacement bridge to the north. The bridge is in length, composed of six concrete through girders. This carries a concrete deck and full-height abutments over solid concrete piers with bullnosed cutwaters. In total, it used some of concrete in the design. The girder walls feature rectangular recessed panels capped by concrete copings. History Today, drivers cannot use the Peshekee River Bridge south of US 41/M-28 in western Marquette County's Michigamme Township, although access can be had on foot from the eastern side. The bridge is under the supervision of the Michigan State Parks with the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and is part of the Van Riper State Park. The bridge was built in 1914 in response to the 1913 State Trunk Line Act passed by the Michigan Legislature. This act created the State Trunkline Highway System comprising nearly . The act further said that the Michigan State Highway Department would design, build and maintain trunkline bridges spanning or more so long as the local governments improved an adjacent of roads. Marquette County built a mainline road from Marquette west to Michigamme near the county line, including an improved section in 1913 to encourage the state to build the bridge. The bridge was designed by C.V. Dewart for the department and built by the local firm of Powell and Mitchell in Marquette. The Peshekee River Bridge would later be incorporated into the routing of US 41 in the 1920s. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999 as \\"Trunk Line Bridge No. 1\\" for its engineering and architectural significance. MDOT has listed it as \\"one of Michigan's most important vehicular bridges.\\" It was the first bridge designed by the Michigan State Highway Department, the forerunner to MDOT, in 1914. The original bridge was abandoned as a roadway when a second crossing was built. The second crossing was bypassed and demolished during the construction of the current highway bridge over the Peshekee River on US 41/M-28 in late 1995.

He had a master of laws (senhor de leis) degree.Sarah Kay, \\"Grafting the knowledge community: The purposes of verse in the Breviari d'amor of Matfre Ermengaud\\", Neophilologus, 91:3 (2007), p. 362 and n3, notes that scholars are unsure whether Matfre became a friar before or after composing the Breviari. Paul Meyer, \\"Matfr√© Ermengaud de B√©ziers, troubadour\\", Histoire litt√©raire de la France, 32, Suite de quatorzi√®me si√®cle (Paris: Impr. Nationale, 1898), pp. 15-56, is the first full treatment of Matfre's life. He wrote one canso, whose melody survives, and one moralising sirventes. His most famous work was an Occitan poetic book in 35,600 octosyllables called the Breviari d'amor, begun in 1288. Encyclopedic in length and diversity, its sole purpose is the reconciliation of love for God with the erotic amours of the troubadour lyric.Kay, p. 362, calls the Breviari \\"one of the most ambitious vernacular encyclopaedias of the Middle Ages\\", noting that it is remarkable that it is in verse. It is divided into parts and is structured like a \\"tree of love\\". The Breviari is preserved in twelve full codices and as many fragments. It was translated into Castilian and the Limousin dialect (once thought to be Catalan or catalanisant Occitan).William D. Paden, \\"Review of Le Breviari d'Amor de Matfre Ermengaud, ed. Peter T. Ricketts\\", Romance Philology, 37:1 (1983:Aug.), p. 109. Matfre also says that he would have written better in Latin (from which he borrowed the word breviari, from breviarium, not found elsewhere in medieval Occitan). The work begins with popular theology, a section entitled \\"The Study of God and the Creation\\". From the Trinity it moves to angels, demons, then the zodiac and the planets. Then in a section entitled \\"The Study of Nature\\" (\\"Natural Law\\") he discusses the proper modes of worship, then the temptations that affect Christians and the sins they must avoid. Exempla are drawn from daily life. Finally, in \\"The Love of God\\", he summarises the Christian creeds, the life of Christ, and several hagiographies.Amelia Van Vleck, \\"Matfre Ermengaud\\", Medieval France: An Encyclopedia, William W. Kibler and Grover A. Zinn, edd. (Routledge, 1995), p. 601. The last section (8,000 lines) of the work, \\"Perilhos tractatz d'amor de donas, seguon qu'en han tractat li antic trobador en lurs cansos\\", structured as a dialogue between the defenders Love and her critics, is filled with citations (266 by some counts) of other troubadours and even some trouv√®res; Matfre cited himself six (Jeanroy) or nine (Paden) times and cited his brother Peire twice. He was careful to cite poets from different eras, but his favourites appear to be Aimeric de Peguilhan, Bernart de Ventadorn, and Peire Vidal of the \\"classical era\\".For a thorough treatment of Matfre's citation practices, see Francesca M. Nicholson, \\"Branches of knowledge: The purposes of citation in the Breviari d'amor of Matfre Ermengaud\\", Neophilologus, 91:3 (2007), pp. 375-85. The title of \\"Perilhos\\" indicates that the antic (old) troubadours were authorities on poetic and amatory matters. He even quotes in support of this Raimon Jordan using the word antic of his predecessors. Matfre's knowledge of the early troubadours came largely through reading and he indicates that the early troubadours \\"sung\\" about love, not that they wrote about it, as did Matfre and his contemporaries. After the \\"Perilhos\\", Matfre includes a letter (epistola) to his sister, written in decasyllabic rhyming couplets: Fraires Matfre a sa cara seror. In it he explains the symbolism of a Christmas capon. Matfre has been credited, along with Ferrari da Ferrara, for pioneering the anthologising of the troubadours. Matfre is partly responsible for the later treatment of single coblas as distinct units, because he regularly quoted one cobla from a troubadour and treated it as a single thought. Matfre had become quite famous by the time Peire de Ladils lumped him together with the heroes of Arthurian romance (c.1340).

The Norfolk Street Wesleyan Chapel, built in 1780 and demolished in 1906 to make way for the Victoria Hall. An alternative view seen from the junction of Norfolk Street and Arundel Gate. Chapel Walk Victoria Hall is a Methodist place of worship situated on Norfolk Street in Sheffield city centre. It is the most important Methodist building in Sheffield and it is a Grade II listed building.Sheffield City Council website. Information on all listed buildings within the Sheffield city boundary. It is a large many roomed building which stands between the side streets of Chapel Walk and George Street. Although the main entrance to the church is on Norfolk Street, there is a separate administration entrance on Chapel Walk. History Original chapels The origins of Methodism in South Yorkshire date from 1742, when John Wesley arrived in Sheffield on a preaching tour and founded the nucleus of the Sheffield Methodist Society. They met at a small wooden meeting house in Cheyney Square which was on the site of the current Town Hall. The meeting house was destroyed in a riot in 1743 during a service conducted by Charles Wesley and a new chapel was built on Mulberry Street at the expense of the local magistrates for failing to keep the peace. The Mulberry Street chapel was used for worship by the Methodists until 1779 when the Norfolk Street Wesleyan Chapel on the present site of Victoria Hall was completed. The Chapel was opened and consecrated in 1780 by the 77-year-old John Wesley, who described it as \\"One of the largest in the Kingdom\\" and presented the new building with a set of silver communion vessels.\\"At the Heart of the City\\", Nicholas Farr, Gives history of church. Despite substantial renovation and the introduction of new vestries in 1875 at a cost of ¬£6,000, the building was demolished in 1906 to make way for a more distinguished and larger structure. The old building was closed for the last time on 13 May 1906. New hall built On 26 September 1906 the foundation stone for the new Victoria Hall was laid followed by a celebratory lunch at the Cutlers Hall. The Hall was opened on Thursday 24 September 1908 with the final cost being in excess of ¬£40,000, a huge sum at the time, but the Wesleyan mission cleared the debt within three years. The total expenditure included the outlay for extra land, with Sheffield entrepreneur Thomas Cole donating land for an enlarged site for the new church . The new Hall was originally designed by Waddington Son & Dunkerley but much of the design was re-worked by William John Hale (1862‚Äì1929) in 1908. Hale blended Gothic and Arts and Crafts styles and was instrumental in designing the large Baroque top to the tower. The carved decorations on the hall are by Alfred and William Tory and portrayals of the Wesley brothers are integrated into the design.\\"Pevsner Architectural Guides ‚Äì Sheffield\\", Ruth Harman & John Minnis, , Page 120 Gives architectural information. The new hall was part of the Forward Movement of the Methodist church inspired by Hugh Price Hughes who called for a national religion which preached to the poor and resulted in the building of Central Halls in most of Britain's large cities.\\"An Introduction to World Methodism\\", Kenneth Cracknell & Susan J. White, Gives details of the Forward Movement. One of the Hall's first accomplishments was to set up the Sheffield Mission Labour Yard in Joiner Lane off The Wicker. This tackled the high level of unemployment of the time and by June 1909 had provided 5,903 days work to almost 6,000 men. The yard closed in 1915 as the First World War reduced unemployment to virtually nil. The Hall has always had strong connections with Trade unionism and in September 1909 the Trade Union Congress held its annual conference at the hall, since then various unions have held meetings there. In the Hall's early days the surrounding area was densely populated and thousands of young people attended Sunday School, Scouting, Girl Guides and Boys' Brigade. Wartime During the First World War the Hall opened its doors to care for the members of the armed forces and after the end of the conflict the Hall received a visit from King George V and Queen Mary during their visit to Sheffield in 1919. The king presented medals to the returning soldiers from the platform in the sanctuary. During the years of the Great Depression the Hall served free breakfasts to needy children and distributed food parcels as well helping the unemployed. Prior to the completion of the Sheffield City Hall in 1932, the Victoria Hall was the leading concert venue in the city with many leading orchestras playing concerts there. In the Second World War the hall survived the Sheffield Blitz air raids of December 1940, with The Messiah being sung to an audience of over 200 people on the Sunday after the raids.\\"Raiders Over Sheffield\\", Mary Walton & J.P. Lamb, Page 68 Gives details of Sheffield Blitz raids. On 9 May 1941 part of Victoria Hall was converted into a rest hostel for the Forces with 20 beds, this was later expanded to 35 beds. Present day Today the hall stands in an important position in the city centre, across from Tudor Square and close to the Crucible and Lyceum theatres. As well as a place of worship, the Hall is used by various voluntary organisations including meals for the homeless. It is a popular venue for classical music concerts and the function room is available for hire by the general public.

He is also one of few German officers who were awarded the Pour le M√©rite and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. He also served as a deputy member on the \\"Court of Military Honour,\\" a drumhead court-martial that expelled many of the officers involved in the 20 July Plot from the Army before handing them over to the People's Court. Summary of his military career 1 May 1899: Entered the Army as a Fahnenjunker in the Infanterie-Regiment Prinz Friedrich der Niederlande (2. Westf√§lisches) Nr.15. 1 October 1904: Transferred to the Protection Troops in German Southwest Africa. [In January 1904, the native Herero tribe of Southwest Africa rebelled against German colonial rule over the expropriation of their land and cattle. Later in the year, the Nama/Hottentot tribe also took up arms against their colonial rulers. Generalleutnant Lothar von Trotha, the Military Commander of German Southwest Africa, suppressed the rebellion with extreme brutality. Relying on a policy of ethnic cleansing backed by forced labor, deportations, wholesale execution of prisoners and the use of concentration camps, the Germans crushed the rebellion by early 1907. In 1915, South Africa took over the German colony as a League of Nations‚Äô mandate called South West Africa. Renamed Namibia in 1968, the country only achieved its independence from South Africa in 1990. 10 March 1914: Transferred to the Magdeburgisches J√§ger-Bataillon Nr.4. 1 August 1914: Company Leader in J√§ger Battalion 4. 24 August 1914: Wounded/hospitalized. 15 August 1916: Commander of the Hannoversches J√§ger- Bataillon Nr.10. 27 January 1919: Commander of the Volunteer Hannoverian J√§ger Battalion ‚ÄúKirchheim.‚Äù 2 August 1919: Detached to the Prussian War Ministry and then to the Reich Defense Ministry. 1 January 1921: Company Chief in the 17th Infantry Regiment upon the formation of the new Reichsheer from the √úbergangsheer or Transitional Army. 1 May 1923: On the staff of the 1st Cavalry Division, Frankfurt/Oder. 15 May 1926: Commander of the I. Battalion of an infantry regiment ‚Äì possibly the 7th (Prussian) Infantry Regiment. 1 February 1930: Commandant of Glatz. 31 March 1932: Retired from the Army. 1 October 1934: Reactivated in the Army and appointed Commander of the Training Battalion of Infantry Regiment ‚ÄúArnsberg.‚Äù 15 November 1934: Delegated with the post of head of the K√∂ln Military Area Command. 7 March 1936: Commander of the K√∂ln Military Area Command. 1 June 1938: Commander of the Wien I Military Area Command. 1 October 1939: Commander of Infantry Regiment 276 of the 94th Infantry Division. 1 December 1939 ‚Äì 31 January 1941: Commander of the 169th Infantry Division. [Initially held in reserve, Kirchheim's division took part in the second phase of the invasion of France in June 1940 under General der Infanterie Ernst Busch's 16th Army. Following the Franco-German armistice, the 169th Infantry Division remained in Lorraine under the 1st Army on occupation duties for the remainder of the year.] 1 March 1941: As leader of Special Staff Libya, he was delegated with the leadership of elements of the Italian 27th Brescia Infantry Division. Arriving in Libya on 24 February 1941, Kirchheim and his special staff consisted of officers with military experience in Africa prior to and during World War I. Kirchheim was charged with studying the varied conditions in North Africa, however Generalleutnant Erwin Rommel, recently arrived and the commanding general of the newly formed German Afrika Korps chose to use Kirchheim's staff to reinforce his understrength field formations. During Rommel's first offensive in Cyrenaica (31 March 1941 ‚Äì 12 April 1941), Generalmajor Kirchheim led the northern group that pushed up the Via Balbia coast road from Agedabia. Upon reaching Benghazi on 4 April 1941, Kirchheim's force split into two columns. The northernmost column, a reinforced regimental sized detachment of one infantry and one artillery battalion of the Italian 27th Brescia Infantry Division and one infantry battalion of the Italian 25th Bologna Infantry Division, commanded by Kirchheim, continued advancing up the Via Balbia to clear Australian rearguards. The German Reconnaissance Battalion 3, commanded by Oberstleutnant Irnfried Freiherr von Wechmar, hooked east and crossed the desert south of the Jebel el Akdar hills to Mechili. Securing northern Cyrenaica, Kirchheim's Brescia column linked up with the German Machinegun Battalion 8, commanded by Oberstleutnant Gustav Ponath, at Derna on 8 April 1941. Following his advance up the Via Balbia, Generalmajor Kirchheim next saw action during Rommel's attempt to seize the critical coastal fortress of Tobruk. On 16 May 1941, Rommel placed Kirchheim in command of a battle group formed from the bulk of Generalmajor Johannes Streich's 5th Light Division for an assault against the Ras el Madauer high ground on the Tobruk defensive perimeter. Though the group did seize the high ground, the attempt to capture Tobruk failed after suffering the loss of almost 1,400 German and Italian dead, wounded and missing. Rommel was dissatisfied with Kirchheim, and replaced him with Johann von Ravenstein on 30 May.Mitcham, Samuel W. (2007).

The court members consisted of Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt, Generaloberst Heinz Guderian, General der Infanterie Walter Schroth and Generalleutnant Karl-Wilhelm Specht. Additionally, General der Infanterie Karl Kriebel and Generalleutnant Kirchheim were designated standing representatives for members who could not attend a court sitting.[2] Generalmajor Ernst Maisel, Chief of the Office Group for Officers‚Äô Education and Welfare (P 2) of the Army Personnel Office, served as the court protocol officer. Based on evidence provided by the Gestapo (suspects did not appear in person to defend themselves), the court decided whether a suspect was ‚Äúexpelled‚Äù or ‚Äúdischarged‚Äù from the Army. The former verdict would result in a suspect's release from military jurisdiction to face trial before the infamous People's Court and subsequent execution. In a special meeting on 4 October 1944, the court heard the evidence implicating Generalleutnant Dr. phil. Hans Speidel in the conspiracy.[3] The court refused to expel Speidel from the Army opting instead for his discharge. Although he spent the rest of the war in prison, the verdict insured Speidel did not appear before the People's Court.Rommel's Desert Commanders, page 28 15 October 1944 ‚Äì 31 March 1945: Berlin Military Recruitment Inspector. 1 April 1945: Army High Command Leader Reserve. 12 April 1945 ‚Äì 6 October 1947: Prisoner of war. 4 May 1945 transferred to Trent Park Camp 11 sorting camp. 24 January 1946 to Island Farm Special Camp 11 from Camp 1 11 January 1947 transferred to Camp 99 from Island Farm Special Camp 11 21 March 1947 to Island Farm Special Camp 11 from Camp 99 1 April 1947 transferred to LDC (London District Cage) from Island Farm Special Camp 11 30 September 1947 transferred to US custody for discharge.

Background At the age of seven he developed a passion for the trumpet after discovering Louis Armstrong on television. He met a prominent trumpeter of the Paris Opera who touched by his fascination for the trumpet, introduced him to the instrument and accompanies all during his studies at the Conservatory and has the Normal School of Music. Early years At the age of fourteen he had trumpet lessons at the school of music in Paris. When he was eighteen, Borelly wanted to share his passion so he started teaching the trumpet to the beginners at the school of music. During the 1970s, Borelly became fanatical about rhythm and blues. He was so fond of it that he did not hesitate to give up his classical studies and start playing in bands. Dolannes Melodie 1975 was a turning point in Borelly's life. The recording of \\"Dolannes Melodie\\" (title theme of the film Un linceul n'a pas de poches) was about to change his future. This record quickly went to first place in the charts of most European countries, first in France, Switzerland, Belgium and then Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands. It was also in the first place in Mexico and later in Japan. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. With \\"Dolannes Melodie\\", Borelly managed to introduce his own modern trumpet style. Together with Paul de Senneville and Olivier Toussaint (his composers/producers), he has developed a melodious and romantic style of music. Recent years In 1995, he decided to move to Las Vegas. He gave several concerts. In 2000, he returned to France and, three years later, he composed and recorded The Sound of Lac d'Amour.

An early design study of the camera was shown at PMA on 8 March 2007, and a newer prototype announced at PMA 2008 on 31 January 2008. Sony officially introduced the final camera on 9 September 2008 prior to photokina 2008. In October 2011, Sony Japan announced the camera's end of production. The specifications include: 24.6-megapixel CMOS sensor, 5 frame/s burst mode, dual BIONZ processors, 100% viewfinder, 9-point AF with 10 assist points, inbuilt image sensor shift stabilization and intelligent preview. It does not have video/movie recording. Intelligent preview mode This mode, first introduced on the DSLR-A900, allows the photographer to take a sample image at the current settings. When this mode is enabled in the settings (default), then using the depth of field (DOF) preview button makes a preview image of the subject. The display shows the image and its image histogram, but it is not stored on the memory card. At that point, the photographer can accept current settings or simulate how the image (and histogram) would look with changes in aperture, shutter speed, dynamic range optimizer and white balance. If the photographer prefers those new settings he simply continues to work to accept them. Otherwise he can reject them by depressing the garbage can icon. He can also compare the sample to the simulation by depressing the DISP button.  Predecessor to the DSLR-A850  The DSLR-A900 requires a labour- intensive alignment procedure in the factory in order to provide a 100% scene view in the viewfinder. In eliminating this costly procedure by masking the view to a slightly smaller area (98%) while also downspecifying the frame rate to 3 frames per second, the DSLR-A850 offers a camera with most of the benefits of the DSLR-A900 at a significant saving to the photographer.

The book is a first hand account of the Marines and Navy Corpsmen of Charlie Company, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division during the Vietnam War culminating in Operation Medina in October 1967. Based on extensive interviews with survivors of Operation Medina, as well as with the friends and families of the men who didn't make it back, Lions of Medina takes readers through the training, the hardships, the tragedies, and the triumphs of war, and into the heart of a close-knit group of warriors who fought, bled, and died together, and shared a spirit of loyalty and camaraderie that binds them together to this day. Operation Medina Operation Medina was a search and destroy operation conducted in the Hai Lang Forest Reserve of South Vietnam in the fall of 1967 during the Vietnam War. Conducted by the First and Second battalions of the First Marine Regiment, the First Battalion of the Third Marine Regiment, and two battalions of the First ARVN Division, the objective of the operation was to locate and annihilate any North Vietnamese (NVA) forces found in the forest reserve. One specific enemy base that the Marines sought to eliminate was known as Base Area 101. Base Area 101 was an NVA staging area, a place where the NVA felt safe enough to build up personnel and supplies. The base was a launching point for attacks by the Fifth and Sixth NVA Regiments against the possible Marine bases at Con Thien, Khe Sahn, Dong Ha and Phu Bai. Operation Medina began on 10 October 1967 and ended on 20 October. The operation obtained partial success. Even though the NVA were not driven out of the Hai Lang Forest Reserve, significant losses were inflicted upon them by the Marine and ARVN forces. Critical Acclaim \\"Doyle Glass has written a stirring tribute to the valor of Marines in Vietnam.

In 1794, Peter Smith leased, and subsequently acquired full title to, of land from the Oneidas under Chief Skenadoah. The tract comprised the central portion of modern-day Madison County and parts of the current Oneida County. Over of land in the northeastern part of the country were transferred in thousands of transactions at the land office, which was used for that purpose until the late 19th century. Gerrit Smith, Peter's son, continued in the land business after his father. He also established the Peterboro Academy in 1853 and an orphanage in 1871. He was an active abolitionist. His grandson, Gerrit Smith Miller, was a noted philanthropist and active in the women's suffrage movement. The land office was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, and is part of the larger Gerrit Smith Estate which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2001.

The Sweet Family was known for their good disposition, and as natural bone setters. William Russell Sweet was the son of Amos Reynolds Sweet (who helped build the Old Washington County jails in 1858) and Sarah Coggshall Sweet; then married Mary De Laigle Herndon 6/15/1893; and fathered 3 children (Colonel Russell Herndon Sweet, Margaret Grace Waring Sweet-Treat and Leila Augusta Sweet-Hay: members of SAR and DAR) and was buried in the family plot at Oak Dell Historical Cemetery, Peace Dale, RI. These two sisters, Margaret and Leila lived to over 100 years old. Colonel Russell Herndon Sweet was honored in 1946 with the 'Legion of Merit' award for his brave work in the Military Intelligence Service of the War Department during both World War I and World War II, who married Lucy Humphrey Young in Rhode Island 1919. The Sweet family were said to be remarkable, happy natured people,Hazard, Thomas Rowland, The Johnny Cake Papers of Shephard Tom, 1879,p. 334 Sanborn Press Newport, RI. William Russell Sweet was known throughout the Narragansett area as ‚ÄòSweet-The Painter‚Äô (The post office delivered postcards under such title) because of his prolific art works in watercolors, gouaches and oils, many wall murals and restorations created for the famed Newport mansions, and his masterful wood carvings of furniture and wall mounts. William and his family spend many summer days along the coast lines of Rhode Island, where he sketched and painted scenes of Rhode Island the fields, forests, waterfronts and local architecture as themes in his watercolors, gouache and oils. William Russell Sweet carved many pieces including wall plaques, tables and chairs, each of individual themes; such as, the Sweet Coat of Arms, New England sea shells as Quahogs and scallops, maple leaves, nuts and berries, textile weaving patterns, and animals. William Russell Sweet greatly admired the American Indian and depicted their lifestyle in some of his art pieces. He mentored others young artists in these wood carving skills. In 1896, William Russell Sweet created a hutch cabinet themed upon the classical poem \\"The Song of Hiawatha\\" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow published in 1855. William Russell Sweet, painter and sculptor, carved this hutch cabinet using local oak wood. The figures were fashioned from Amos Sweet‚Äôs pruned cherry and apple trees (Amos Street) in Peace Dale, RI. This piece of artwork stood in the family parlor and exhibited William‚Äôs personal collection of Narragansett Indian ‚Äòart-of-fact‚Äô as arrow heads and stone tools found in the soil around southern Rhode Island.

Banana production in Belize accounted for 16 percent of total Belizean exports in 1999. Banana production was aided in the 1990s by privatization and market and production. Banana production in Belize fluctuates, falling from 68,000 tons in 1994 to 45,000 tons in 1995 before rising back to 78,000 tons in 1999. Banana production in Belize began in the late nineteenth century when it was a British colony, when American and British investors established the first plantations. Over the last 70 years, the pattern of banana production has gradually shifted away from large scale American and British owned company production to smaller-scale localised indigenous farming primarily targeted at the European market. History The Banana trade began between British Honduras and New Orleans. Commerce was wiped out in the 1920s by an outbreak of the Panama disease. Plantations were destroyed again by hurricanes in 1975 and 1978. The subsequent takeover of banana cultivation by the Banana Control Board, a public enterprise, had the effect of further inhibiting production. By mid-1985, the Banana Control Board had accumulated debts of US$9 million. The government reacted to the plight of the board by selling the 880 hectares under cultivation to the private sector. Five years later, banana production had almost tripled, and the cultivated area had increased to more than 2,400 hectares. The Banana Control Board was reorganized and retained the responsibility for marketing and research. In 1991 responsibility for the board was passed to the Banana Growers' Association. Britain was the almost exclusive importer of Belizean bananas. Marketing of exports was handled by Fyffes, an Irish subsidiary of the United States company, United Fruit. The special provisions of the Lom√© Convention's Banana Protocol allowed Britain to guarantee artificially high prices for bananas to the beneficiaries of the protocol. These prices were above prices in the United States and Germany. The purpose of this special provision was to protect the central export crop of some of the islands of the Lesser Antilles, members of the Commonwealth of Nations, from ruinous competition from low-cost producers in Latin America. The preferential access to EEC markets provided by the Lom√© Convention was under advisement in 1991 by the EEC in connection with its single-European-market program. It appeared that Belize would be better prepared for a drop in prices than would the islands of the Lesser Antilles, as Belizean producers received far lower prices through the protocol than did their Caribbean neighbors. New port facilities at Big Creek in southern Stann Creek District were expected to increase banana exports. Until 1990 Belizean bananas had had to go through Puerto Cort√©s, Honduras, which added to overhead. Fyffes then financed the construction of Big Creek, Belize's only deep-water port. This port was designed to serve as the main shipment point for Belizean bananas. Between 1989 and 1991, banana production was hampered by cold weather and black sigatoka disease, and production was expected to double in 1992 because of the new port, better disease control, and improved drainage and irrigation systems. The susceptibility of bananas to disease and possible changes in Belize's preferential access to the British market were factors that could limit growth in this sector.  Labor practices  In 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor's report on the worst forms of child labor estimated that working children aged 5 to 14 represented 8.3% of Belize's population which corresponds to around 7,000 children engaged in child labor, especially in the agricultural sector.2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Belize - Harvesting bananas is one of the activities mentioned in the DOL report. Belize was once again classified as one of the 74 countries with significant incidence of child labor in a 2014 List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor published by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs.List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor The U.S. Department of Labor added that \\"important gaps remain in the country's legal framework on the worst forms of child labor [...] and the impact of many of the Government's development and education policies and programs on child labor remains unknown.\\" References Banana production Crops originating from Belize ","title":"Banana production in Belize"},{"id":"19106974","text":"Henri Lhote (16 March 1903 - 26 March 1991) was a French explorer, ethnographer, and discoverer of prehistoric cave art.

Biography  In this 1967 photo, Henri Lhote poses next to rock art in the Sahara Desert of Mauritania. Lhote was orphaned at age 12 and subsequently became a boy scout, where he learned about anthropology. He was largely self-taught until he became a pupil and prot√©g√© of Abb√© Breuil, a great expert on prehistoric cave art in France. He began to do fieldwork in anthropology in 1929 but his work was often contested due to his lack of credentials. In 1945, at the age of 42, he finally obtained a doctorate under the direction of Marcel Griaule. He led unsuccessful expeditions to Hoggar and Teffedest Mountains in 1949-1950.Bruno Lecoquierre, ¬´ Monique V√âRIT√â, Henri Lhote ‚Äì Une aventure scientifique au Sahara ¬ª, Insaniyat / ÿ•ŸÜÿ≥ÿßŸÜŸäÿßÿ™ [online], 51-52  2011, consulted 1 November 2017. URL : http://insaniyat.revues.org/12835 Discovery of Tassili Lhote met and befriended a French soldier named Charles Brennans who had discovered rock paintings and engravings in a remote, uninhabited zone on the edge of the Sahara desert, while on an exploratory mission there in the 1930s. The artwork was on sandstone cliffs in a deep wadi of a barren plateau known as Tassili-n- ajjer, and included depictions of elephants, giraffes, rhinoceroses, and strange human figures. With the help of Brennans, and with financial support from the Mus√©e de l'Homme in Paris, Lhote mounted an expedition to investigate. They landed in Djanet in February 1956 and made their way over land to Tassili. Lhote later wrote that he had never seen anything \\"so extraordinary, so original, so beautiful\\" as the art at Tassili n'Ajjer. Over 16 months in 1956 and 1957 Lhote and his associates discovered about 800 paintings, many of which he documented with the aid of painters and photographers. These images were presented in 1957 and 1958 at the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs in Paris and were, in the opinion of the writer and politician Andr√© Malraux, \\"one of the most defining exhibitions of the mid- century\\".Jeremy Keenan, The Lesser Gods of the Sahara: Social Change and Indigenous Rights, London: Frank Cass Publishers, 2004, p. 163 ff. Lhote mounted three subsequent expeditions to Tassili between 1958 and 1962. Ancient Astronauts In his book The Search for the Tassili Frescoes: The story of the prehistoric rock-paintings of the Sahara (1958), Lhote publicized the hypothesis that the humanoid drawings at Tassili represented space aliens. He baptized one particularly large and curious figure \\"Jabbaren\\" and described him as the \\"great Martian god.\\" The popular press gave a lot of attention to this hypothesis of a prehistoric close encounter, and Lhote's arguments were later incorporated into the evidence assembled by Erich von D√§niken for the thesis that ancient extraterrestrial astronauts visited the Earth in prehistoric times. However, mainstream scientists regard the \\"great Martian god\\" and other rock art figures of Tassili as representations of ordinary humans in ritual masks and costumes rather than extraterrestrial lifeforms. For instance a dance scene that Lhote discovered in 1956 can be attributed on stylistic grounds to Neolithic hunters who lived in the area (which was then fertile) around 6,000 to 8,000 years ago. Re-evaluation In 2003 a British anthropologist named Jeremy Keenan undertook a review of Lhote's publications and concluded that \\"many of the claims of the expedition's leader, Henri Lhote, were misleading, a number of the paintings were faked, and the copying process was fraught with errors.\\" Keenan also found that the political context of French colonization of Algeria had influenced the treatment of the site and the interpretation of the artworks. In particular he singled out Abb√© Breuil as \\"the arch-advocate of foreign influence in African rock art.\\" He alleged that the expedition's methods caused damage to the rock art and \\"sterilized the archaeological landscape\\".Jeremy Keenan, \\"Lesser gods of the Sahara\\", in The Journal of North African Studies, vol.8 no.3-4 (Autumn- winter 2003), reprinted in Keenan, Lesser Gods of the Sahara, op. cit.

It contains three novels, and has a sister series, The Nightrunner Series, which contains seven. The series contains mythopoeia. The resounding issue dealt with within the series is the on-and-off war between two fictional countries, Skala and Plenimar, and their citizens, with other countries and people often getting caught in the crossfire. The series focuses on Queen Tam√≠r II, known throughout her childhood as Prince Tobin, and how she goes from being a sad, haunted child, to a Warrior Queen. Dark magic was used to disguise her in childhood from her Uncle, who would have all the women in his line killed in case they tried to take his throne, but the Oracle predicts that Tam√≠r will be Queen, and many people go through unbelievable lengths to make sure that it happens. It has been translated into multiple languages and published in multiple countries, including Russia. Bantam Spectra is the publishing company of all three, as well as the sister series, The Nightrunner Series. Synopsis The story is set in the land of Skala - a world with knights, lords, ladies and wizards. Long ago, the Lightbearer pronounced a prophecy; so long as a daughter of the royal line defends and rules, Skala will never be subjugated. Under the reign of Warrior Queens, Skala was free of famine and disease for a time. However, Skala is now ruled by King Erius - a usurper king who took the throne in the place of his younger sister. King Erius' rule brought famine, plague, and invasion - and his fear of a child with a stronger claim to the throne led him to order the deaths of all girls of the royal line, save his sister. The story begins when a wizard and her apprentice learn of a child born of Ariani, the King's sister. This child is destined to overthrow her Uncle and become Queen of Skala, but in order to do this she will need protection and guidance. And if King Erius learns of her birth, she will be killed immediately. Quickly, the Wizards rush to find a way to disguise their future Queen. Ariani gives birth to twins - a boy and a girl. In order to save the girl, they kill the boy-child and use hill-witch magic to transform the girl's body into that of a boy. The wizards tell the king that the girl-child, and not the boy, died in childbirth. Saved by this lie, the child (named Tobin) grows up knowing nothing of her true identity as a girl and a future Queen, nor of the murder that was committed to save her. Tobin (thinking herself a boy) has a lonely childhood, hidden away from Court and all other children in order to keep him from danger. He grows up with a mother driven mad from the grief of losing a child, and a father who is rarely home because of the war that plagues their country. Often, his only companion is the angry and vengeful ghost of his dead brother, who haunts him constantly. But things start to change when the wizards bring him a companion - Ki. And eventually Tobin must travel to Court and take his place among the Companions of Prince Korin. Tobin must resist powerful magic, learn to survive at Court, and become a knight and blooded warrior. He struggles with the issue of his identity. And one day he must challenge his friend and cousin for the throne, and fulfill a powerful prophecy. Characters Tam√≠r √≠ Ariani Gherilain, also known as Queen Tam√≠r II, and previously known as Prince Tobin, was introduced in the first book, The Bone Doll's Twin. She is the main character in every following book of the trilogy. The main character of the 'Tamir Triad', Queen Tamir II was initially introduced as Prince Tobin. She was disguised as a boy so as to easily hide from her Uncle, who would have her killed as a threat to his place on the throne, which was rightfully her mother's. Eventually, she must reveal herself as female, and fight her cousin in Civil War, in order to take her place on the throne and repair the country her Uncle had tarnished in his rejection of the Oracle's declaration that there must be a Queen of Skala. She is mentioned in the 'Nightrunner Series' as one of the greatest Skalan Queens, being responsible for the Great Canal, the new capital of Rhiminee', and the Third Oreska. Countries and cultures One defining feature of Skala is that the throne is always held by a Queen, power traveling matrilineally. The queen takes an active role in the defense of Skala, riding out and taking part in battles, and holds the military title of \\"War Commander.\\" She is also in charge of helping her people in times of peace, by acting as the judge for public disputes, as well as controlling taxes, food availability, plague and more. This is due to the prophecy made at the Afran Oracle in Skala, which states: This prophecy was made during The Great War with Plenimar, and King Thelatimos instantly handed the crown to his daughter Gherilain, who quickly led the country to victory. Other than the Queen, there are many important roles within the Skalan government, such as Commanders, Generals, Secretaries, Treasures, etc. Many nobles own their own land and armies, though swear fealty to the Queen and give her their forces in times of war. Following Queen Gherilain the First, there have been many Queens, and occasionally, Kings. Those known are Tamir, who was poisoned by her own brother, Pelis, who became King until plague struck him down and his niece, Agnalain, became Queen. Then was Gherilain II followed by Iaair, who was known to have fought a dragon, Klia, who killed a lion, Klie, Markira, Oslie, who had six fingers, and Marnil, who began the tradition of having more than one consort. Having a male King is not completely ruled out, but still it is very much the exception - a Queen is considered the obviously preferable option (the opposite of how things were in historical feudal monarchies); having a King instead of a Queen involves the risk of pestilence, drought and/or foreign invasion - all attributed to the Illior's curse. In the generation preceding that of Tamir II, Queen Agnalain III was the first mad Queen and Erius, her son, became King because his sister was still just a child at the time of their mother's death - but Tamir II, his niece, became Queen instead of his son when he died. Moral issues At the center of the Tam√≠r Triad is the moral issue of whether the end justifies the means. This is put very starkly at the very beginning. In order to save the future of Skala, the True Queen, Tam√≠r, must survive the murderous schemes of her usurper uncle and live to grow to maturity. But in order to provide the magical disguise which alone could preserve her life, the well-meaning protagonists must perpetrate a terrible act - to kill an innocent baby, the future Queen's twin brother, at the very moment of his drawing his first breath. Throughout the three volumes, all those involved in this act not only suffer pangs of conscience but are also quite literally haunted by the vengeful ghost of the murdered baby. In later stages of the plot, there are further cases where it is considered that the end justifies the means, and that anyone discovering the secret must be killed though they are completely innocent. There is a clear difference between the wizard Arkoniel - who tends to be more compassionate - and his teacher and mentor Iya, who while a positive character is more ready to take ruthless decisions. Arkoniel's approach is vindicated when he refrains from killing Ki, Korin/Tamir beloved friend, though Ki was on the point of discovering the secret. As later seen, the living Ki plays a major role in helping Tamir realize her destiny. Transsexual issues Transsexual issues have a central role in the Tam√≠r Triad, as they virtually never were in earlier generations of Fantasy writing. To begin with, Prince Tobin is to all appearances a male - both in his own perception and in that of others. Boys who swim naked together with Tobin have no reason to doubt his male anatomy. Yet, due to the magical reasons which are an important part of the plot, in the underlying, essential identity Tobin had always been a disguised girl. In the cataclysmic scene of magical change this becomes an evident physical fact, and Prince Tobin becomes Queen Tam√≠r, shedding the male body and gaining a fully functioning female one. Yet, it takes Tam√≠r a considerable time and effort to come to terms with her female sexuality. She feels especially queasy at the prospect of eventually becoming pregnant - as she must, since producing an heir is an important part of a Queen's duty. There is also the problematic relationship with Ki, who had been the close boy companion of Prince Tobin and whose transformation into the Queen's lover or Consort is far from smooth or easy. Further reading The companion series The Nightrunner Series, also written by Lynn Flewelling, deals with the ongoing war between Skala and Plenimar from the perspective of two young spies, nearly 600 years after Tam√≠r becomes Queen. In the \\"afterword\\" appearing at the conclusion of Shards of Time, eighth and last book of The Nightrunner Series, Flewelling notes that she \\"had not forgotten Tam√≠r and Ki\\", and might write more books about them. In Chapter 14 of Luck in the Shadows, the character Sedrich tells of Tam√≠r's life from the perspective of six hundred years after her time: \\"Skala's had good queens and bad, but old Tam√≠r was one of the best. Even the balladeers can't improve much on the life she led.\\" This is followed by a brief recapitulation of Tam√≠r's life. After speaking of the events covered in the Tam√≠r Triad, Sedrich goes on tell that \\"during her reign she beat back the Plenimarans, was lost at sea during a battle, then turned up a year later and took back the throne and ruled until she was an old woman\\". As of mid-2017, this later adventure was not written out in full.

The eleventh named storm and sixth cyclone of the season, Kalunde formed on March 4 from an area of disturbed weather east-southeast of Diego Garcia. The storm steadily strengthened and attained severe tropical storm intensity on March 6. After starting a phase of rapid deepening, Kalunde attained cyclone intensity the next day. Kalunde attained its peak intensity on March 8, as an intense tropical cyclone. It maintained its peak strength for a day; shortly thereafter, the system began to weaken. After undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, the storm brushed Rodrigues. Shortly after doing so, Kalunde weakened into a tropical cyclone and later a severe tropical storm. Two days later, on March 16, the cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated the next day. Cyclone Kalunde brought US$3.15 million in damage to Rodrigues Island. A total of 1,600 homes and 40 boats were damaged. Severe coastal damage took place across the island; many roads were washed out. Power outages also occurred across the island, delaying residents access to information pertaining to Kalunde. About 80 percent of the drinking water was contaminated and the entire food crop was destroyed. However, no deaths were reported. Meteorological history An area of convection developed on March 3 several hundred miles to the east- southeast of Diego Garcia. That day, M√©t√©o-France (MFR) issued the first bulletin on Tropical Disturbance 14 while located east-southeast of Diego Garcia. In an environment of weak to moderate wind shear, MFR upgraded the system to tropical depression status. Later on March 4, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the disturbance as shower activity increased, though it initially concentrated west-southwest of the atmospheric circulation. MFR upgraded the depression to moderate tropical storm status at 0600 UTC on March 5; subsequently, the Meteorological Service of Mauritius assigned the system the name Kalunde. Moving west-northwest, the JTWC issued their first warning on the system. Initially, Kalunde did not become much better organized even though deep convection was still increasing. Cyclone Kalunde steadily intensified over the next couple of days while performing a small clockwise loop. MFR upgraded Kalunde to severe tropical storm status at 1200 UTC on March 6. At 1800 UTC, JTWC reported 1-minute sustained winds of . On March 7, Kalunde began to undergo rapid intensification, and at 0600 UTC the MFR upgraded it to a tropical cyclone. At the same time, JTWC also estimated winds of 120 km/h (75 mph), the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). Kalunde undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle on March 12 After the formation of an eye, Kalunde continued to intensify rapidly and at 1800 UTC March 7 MFR declared the system an intense cyclone. Simultaneously, JTWC estimated that Kalunde had attained winds of while located several hundred miles south-southwest of Diego Garcia. Continuing to trek southwest by a mid-level ridge to the southeast, the rapid intensification trend continued until it leveled off early on March 8. At this time, the JTWC reported winds of , equivalent to Category 5 intensity on the SSHWS. Subsequently, MFR remarked that the system had reached its peak wind speed of , as an intense tropical cyclone. After attaining peak intensity, MFR and the JTWC began to lower their intensity estimates as thunderstorms began to erode in the northwestern quadrant of the eyewall. Moving slowly southwest, Intense Tropical Cyclone Kalunde underwent an eyewall replacement cyclone late on March 9. The next day, the JTWC notes that Kalunde re-intensified somewhat; however, this is not supported by MFR‚Äôs estimates. While slowly approaching the small island of Rodrigues, Kalunde was estimated (according to MFR) to have winds of . On March 12, Kalunde passed 55 km (35 mi) away from Rodrigues, and around that time the JTWC reported winds of . MFR downgraded Kalunde to severe tropical storm status at 0000 UTC on March 14. Twelve hours later, the center of circulation became exposed from the convection. Kalunde continued trekking south-southeastward on the March 15 as it underwent extratropical transition. The JTWC stopped monitoring the low at 1200 UTC while estimating winds of . At 1800 UTC on March 15, MFR declared the system extratropical, located approximately south-southeast of Rodrigues. The agency officially stopped tracking the system at 1200 UTC the next day though the storm finally dissipated on March 17. Preparations, impact, and aftermath Prior to the storm's arrival, a class four cyclone alert was issued for Rodrigues Island. (Accessed through LexisNexis) Between March 11 and 13, flights to and from Rodrigues were canceled due to high winds. In addition, Cyclone Kalunde briefly posed a threat to Mauritius. Severe coastal damage took place across Rodrigues. Many roads were washed out, isolating many communities. Wind gusts estimated up to destroyed the island's power and telecommunications grid, leaving the entire populous without power. Communication lines between Rodrigues and nearby Mauritius were also cut. (Accessed through LexisNexis) Hospitals were also without electricity; one operation had to be done using a torch light. Because communication was lost during Kalunde's passage, residents lacked information about the storm for several hours. About 80 percent of the drinking water was contaminated and food crop on the island was washed away. During the storm's three-day passage of the island, of rain fell. A total of 1,600 homes and 40 boats were damaged and losses across the island amounted to ‚Ç¨3.4 million (US$3.15 million). In the wake of the storm, the French Red Cross supplied 1.5 tons of supplies to approximately 10,000 people victims of Kalunde. Mauritius Deputy Prime Minister Paul Berenger visited the island Friday to assess the damage while another official called on Mauritius officials to contribute to a cyclone relief fund for the island group. Twenty technicians were also sent to the area in wake of the storm. Officials estimated that it would take five weeks for power to be fully restored across Rodrigues. (Accessed through LexisNexis) They also stated that if a similar situation took place and people were in need of emergency services, no one would be able to receive them. Furthermore, they proposed that bridges would to be built in order to forestall roads from being washed out again.

S. Church, set in the RuneScape universe.https://www.amazon.co.uk/Betrayal-at-Falador-T-S- Church/dp/0955907802/ The book was released on July 21, 2008, and is the first RuneScape novel. Church set out to write a novel that appealed to gamers, as well as those who had never played RuneScape. The book is set in the year 164 of the Fifth Age, five years before the events of RuneScape, and tells the story of the White Knights' encounter with a werewolf on the fictional world of Gielinor, and the long search that preceded. The novel is a narrative, with the action being narrated from human viewpoint. The protagonist is a young hunter, Kara-Meir, who is also featured in the RuneScape video game. Upon release, the book was overlooked by critics. Background Betrayal at Falador is the first book released by Jagex, with Paul Gower noting \\"It's such great fun to see familiar details of the RuneScape world being used to concoct this exciting novel.\\" The back cover of the book also had review comments from Paul Gower and \\"Zezima\\", the long-time number one ranked RuneScape player. The book makes references to the death of Patroclus through the fate of the valet Bhuler, and the presence on opposing sides of characters called Marius and Sulla refers to events in the first century BC in the Roman Republic. Taking place in the Fifth Age of RuneScape, it is based on events that take place within the game. On October 14, 2008, a copy of the book, signed by senior members of Jagex staff, the cover artist, and the author was placed on eBay by Jagex. The auction was run to raise funds for The Internet Watch Foundation. Jagex auctioned ten such copies of the novel, one per week over a period of ten weeks. A sequel to the book had a tentative release date of September/October 2009. Plot summary Betrayal at Falador takes place in Gielinor, the fictional world of RuneScape, and begins with a woman known as Kara-Meir found near death within the walls of Falador Castle. Sir Amik Varze and his White Knights are determined to locate the attack's perpetrator, speculated to be a monster seen attacking travellers on the outskirts of the region. Kara-Meir is rescued by the Knights of Falador, who retrieve from her three mysterious objects; a finely crafted sword with a green tinge, a strange ring broken into two and some white flowers. At the command of Sir Amik, Squire Theodore is sent to the town of Taverley to consult with the local druids about the flowers. Along the way, he witnesses the gruesome sight of a butchered gypsy caravan. Upon his arrival at Taverley, Kaqemeex the druid confirms that the flowers are in fact snowdrops, which grow on Ice Mountain, adding further suspicion that Kara may be a spy. Doric, the dwarf, in the meantime is mobbed by a band of drunken farmers, and his home is burnt. This is because the attackers have been brainwashed by the H.A.M (Humans against Monsters) society. Returning to Falador, Squire Theodore meets Doric en route. Doric agrees to go to Falador in order to report the mobbing he suffered. In Falador, Kara-Meir forces the werewolf Jerrod to escape the city. Jerrod later sides with Sulla, the Kinshra (Black knight) leader, in order to avenge his hatred against her. Later on, Kara-Meir, Theodore, his mage friend Castimir, the scientist Ebenezer and Doric head to the Monastery of Saradomin. There, Kara-Meir hopes to reveal the identity of her parents. However, the Monastery is destroyed by the Kinshra after a short battle. Late in the book, a battle between the Kinshra and the White Knights of Falador erupts in which Sulla attempts to erase Falador from history. Theodore and a group of friends head to Burthorpe and journey under the Ice Mountain in order to rally arms to defend Falador from defeat. Kara-Meir witnesses Master Phyllis's death - a man who took her in as a young child, teaching her how to fight and smith. Eventually, help is summoned and Kara-Meir and Theodore lead an army of 1500 dwarfs and Imperial Guards. During the battle, Sir Amik is injured whilst in the field. Morale is low and so the valet Bhuler equips the master-at-arm's plate as a disguise to rally the knights. Bhuler is inevitably killed, a sacrifice which makes him a hero. The identity of the traitor who attacked Kara-Meir is revealed to be Sir Finistere, who killed Bryant and Sir Erical and is chased down into the sewers by Ebenezer, Sir Tiffy Cashien and the squire Marius. He attempts to trap and kill the three of them, but is stopped by Sir Pallas, who he then kills. Ebenezer helps break the trap, and Sir Finistere is killed by Marius. After the battle, about 10,000 citizens of Falador cheer Kara Meir and hail her a hero. Kara-Meir, accompanied by Gar'rth, the nephew of the werewolf Jerrod, help rebuild the Monastery. Gar'rth wants to track down his uncle. Meanwhile, Theodore decides to head to Varrock using his new found fame to recruit for more to join his order. Doric has his case heard favourably and will rebuild his home. Whilst Jerrod the werewolf escapes and meets up with Sulla, who has lost his hands, once more. The two agree that there is more to be done in the future.

Looney Tunes animated short directed by Robert McKimson. The cartoon was released on June 5, 1954, and features Foghorn Leghorn, Miss Prissy and Egghead Jr. The cartoon was one of several in the Foghorn Leghorn series utilizing the theme of Foghorn attempting to woo the widowed Miss Prissy by babysitting her gifted son (Egghead, Jr.). Plot A newspaper story in the Barnyard News predicts a cold winter. To avoid freezing in his shack, Foghorn decides to woo Miss Prissy (\\"I need your love to keep me warm\\"), who lives in a warm, cozy cottage across the way. Miss Prissy is flattered by Foghorn's two-second courtship but tells him that, to prove his worthiness as her mate, he needs to show that he can be a worthy father to her bookish-looking son. The little boy ‚Äì Egghead Jr., a chick similar in appearance to Tweety, dressed in a stocking cap and oversized glasses ‚Äì would rather read about \\"Splitting the Fourth Dimension\\" than engage in typical little boy games. Foghorn immediately catches on to this and sets out to win his audition by showing Egghead Jr. how to play various sports games. Although he apparently has never participated in any of the below- listed events before, Egghead Jr. effortly masters them all, as depicted in the cartoon's gags: * Baseball. After Egghead Jr. swallows the ball whole and clonks Foghorn over the head with the bat causing Foghorn to yell \\"NO! NO, boy! You're supposed to hit the ball with it! The ball!\\" the rooster has Egghead Jr. properly use both items. Egghead goes to bat and smashes a line drive down Foghorn's throat, and later fires a fast-pitch offering that slices through Foghorn's bat and a row of trees in the grove. When asked to explain, Egghead produces a series of scientific formulas. * Making paper airplanes. Foghorn makes a conventional one, but Egghead Jr. creates a fighter that not only floats sleekly through the air, it shoots Foggy's plane down in flames. Foghorn is handed another scientific explanation, but Foghorn rejects. * Hide and seek. Foghorn hides in the feedbox, but using a slide rule and a shovel, Egghead Jr. finds the rooster underground and digs him up despite the fact that Egghead is at a considerable distance from the feedbox. Flabbergasted at how the chick accomplished this, Foghorn decides not to look in the feedbox, declaring \\"No, I better not look. I just might be in there.\\" Foghorn tries to take an interest in Egghead Jr.'s pursuits. The chick is experimenting with formulas in his Tiny Tot Chemical Set (marked \\"harmless\\"). Foghorn assumes Egghead Jr. is making \\"sody-pop\\" and shakes it to make it fizz ‚Äì which causes an explosion which burns off all his feathers in an instance, leaving him completely bare. Foghorn returns Egghead Jr. home and cancels the engagement. \\"I've got my bandages to keep me warm!\\" he scowls as he walks off with a crutch and in a full-body bandage.

It is composed of two structural units, the Smoky Hill Chalk Member overlying the Fort Hays Limestone Member. The chalk formed from the accumulation of coccoliths from microorganisms living in what was once the Western Interior Seaway, an inland sea that divided the continent of North America during much of the Cretaceous. It underlies much of the Great Plains of the US and Canada. Evidence of vertebrate life is common throughout the formation and includes specimens of plesiosaurs, mosasaurs, and pterosaurs as well as several primitive aquatic birds. The type locality for the Niobrara Chalk is the Niobrara River in Knox County in northeastern Nebraska.  History of exploration  The Niobrara Chalk was recorded (1857) and named (1862) by Meek, F.B., and Hayden, F.V.. It was first studied during an expedition led by Othniel Charles Marsh of Yale University in 1870. This and following expeditions to the area in 1871 and 1872 yielded the first of many fossil vertebrate remains commonly attributed with the formation. Excavations continued through the following years up to 1879 under the direction of professional fossil collectors such as B. F. Mudge and S. W. Williston appointed by Marsh. The Niobrara Chalk has been continuously explored ever since, with specimens being found by H. T. Martin of the University of Kansas and George F. Sternberg, the son of the famous fossil collector Charles H. Sternberg. Much of the best material from the formation is on display at the Sternberg Museum of Natural History in Hays, Kansas.  Stratigraphy  The Smoky Hill Chalk Member of the Niobrara Chalk contains the majority of the fossils found in the formation, and is subdivided into 23 marker beds. Most vertebrates are present from the upper half of the member. Most of the vertebrate remains were collected and described before the stratigraphy of the Niobrara Chalk was fully understood. Specimens were described as being from layers referred to as being either of gray-blue shale or yellow chalk. This dichotomy is not indicative of different stratigraphic units as was previously thought, but rather is seen as a weathering phenomenon that can be found at varying points in the same outcrop.Williston, S. W., 1897, The Kansas Niobrara Cretaceous: The University Geological Survey of Kansas, v. 2, p. 237‚Äì246. The Fort Hays Limestone Member consists of somewhat harder, massive limestone beds. The Niobrara Formation is overlain by the marine Pierre Shale and is underlain by the Carlile Shale or Benton Shale.  Flora and fauna  During the time of the deposition of the Niobrara Chalk, much life inhabited the seas of the Western Interior Seaway. By this time in the Late Cretaceous many new lifeforms appeared such as mosasaurs, which were to be some of the last of the aquatic lifeforms to evolve before the end of the Mesozoic. Life of the Niobrara Chalk is comparable to that of the Dakota Formation, although the Dakota Formation, which was deposited during the Cenomanian, predates the chalk by about 10 million years.  Mineral resources  Various exposures of Niobrara Chalk were covered and partially silicified as the Ogallala sediments covered the Neogene plains. Re-exposed during the Quaternary, these cherty materials, known as Smoky Hill Jasper and Smoky Hill silicified chalk, or more recently as Niobrara Jasper or Niobrarite, became source material for stone tools from the earliest human habitation of the High Plains. The Niobrara is in places a commercial hydrocarbon reservoir. Natural gas is produced from the Niobrara in the eastern Denver Basin. Oil is produced from the Niobrara in the North Park Basin, and new fracturing methods are allowing much larger areas to be tapped for oil.Google article The Fort Hays member was historically mined on the High Plains for the manufacture of Portland cement at Superior, Nebraska and Yocemento, Kansas, as well as along the Dakota Hogback in Colorado from Lyons to Boulder, and around Pueblo and Florence.Kansas Geological Survey: Fort Hays Chalk, accessed 20 January 2009. Along the Dakota Hogback north of Laporte, Colorado, the Fort Hays Limestone formed a secondary hogback, which was extensively quarried for manufacture of up to 450,000 tons of cement a year.AggregateResearch.com: Cement plant closure opens door to uncertain future, accessed 4 July 2016. The full depth of the Niobrara was quarried by the Western Portland Cement Company at Yankton, South Dakota, which supplied cement to the Panama Canal project.

Pathology It is most commonly found in ornamental koi, which are often used in outdoor ponds or as feeder stock. The first case of KHV was reported in 1998, but not confirmed until later in 1999. KHV is a DNA-based virus. After discovery, it was identified as a strain of herpesvirus. Like other strains, KHV stays with the infected fish for the duration of their lives, making the recovered and exposed fish potential carriers of the virus. Koi fish infected with KHV may die within the first 24‚Äì48 hours of exposure. The virus is found in 33 countries. KHV is listed as a nonexotic disease of the EU, so is watched closely by the European Community Reference Laboratory for Fish Diseases. Symptoms of KHV include: * Gill mottling * Red and white patches appearing on gills * Bleeding gills * Sunken eyes * Pale patches * Blisters Changes in the specimen's behaviour may also indicate the presence of KHV. Behavioural symptoms may include disorientation, hyperactivity and potentially isolation, in which the specimen detaches themselves from the shoal.

Notable UDD leaders include Jatuporn Prompan, Nattawut Saikua, Veera Musikapong, Charan Ditthapichai, and Weng Tojirakarn. The UDD allies itself with the Pheu Thai Party, which was deposed by the 2014 military coup. Before the July 2011 national elections, the UDD claimed that Abhisit Vejjajiva's government took power illegitimately, backed by the Thai Army and the judiciary. The UDD called for the Thai Parliament to be dissolved so that a general election could be held. UDD accused the country's extra-democratic elite‚Äîthe military, judiciary, certain members of the privy council, and other unelected officials‚Äîof undermining democracy by interfering in politics.Thai police issue warrants for 14 protest leaders. NBC News. 14 April 2009 The UDD is composed of mostly rural citizens from northeast (Isan) and north Thailand, of urban lower classes from Bangkok, and of intellectuals. Although the movement seems to receive support from former prime minister-in-exile Thaksin Shinawatra, not all UDD members support the deposed prime minister.The Economist, \\"Smiling for the cameras\\", 31 March 2010 History The UDD first formed in 2006 to oppose the military government and the military coup which overthrew former prime minister-in- exile, Thaksin Shinawatra, five weeks before scheduled elections. UDD organized anti-government rallies during the military government's rule in 2006‚Äì2007 and opposed the military's 2007 constitution. The UDD stopped protests after the 2007 general election, which the People's Power Party won. In response to violent anti-government PAD rallies and the yellow shirt seizure of Government House in May 2008, the UDD organized counter- demonstrations, which would sporadically result in injuries and deaths. After Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva took office, the UDD led major anti- government rallies in April 2009 and March‚ÄìMay 2010, leading to violent clashes with military forces. The UDD calls for the replacement of the Ammatayathipatai (‡∏≠‡∏≥‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏ò‡∏¥‡∏õ‡πÑ‡∏ï‡∏¢, aristocratic polity)‚Äîthe system in which palace insiders, the military, and bureaucrats effectively ignore the popular mandate‚Äîwith an electoral democracy. One of the UDD's favorite targets is Prem Tinsulanonda, the president of the privy council. Protests urge the immediate resignation of Prem from the privy council. Due to its insistence that palace insiders stop interfering in politics, the UDD has been criticized by the PAD as being an \\"anti-monarchist\\", and even a \\"republican\\" movement, and many websites and other media sympathetic to the UDD have been shut down under Thailand's strict l√®se majest√© laws. UDD leaders and supporters have been jailed under the same laws. UDD versus PAD, 2008 UDD supporters have been anti-PAD since the 2006 coup, when they accused PAD of supporting the coup. From then on, clashes between supporters of the two groups have occurred from time to time, such as the clash in Udon Thani in July 2008. There, red-shirted UDD supporters attacked a PAD rally, injuring several PAD supporters. A PAD meeting in Chiang Mai, a bastion of Thaksin Shinawatra, was also disturbed. Before daybreak on 2 September 2008, UDD supporters rallying at Sanamluang attacked PAD demonstrators gathering on the Makkhawan Rangsan Bridge at Ratchadamnoen Klang Avenue. The ensuing clash left several injured on both sides and one dead on the UDD side, causing a state of emergency in Bangkok.Ghosh, Nirmal. \\"Clash of the Thai-tans\\" . The Straits Times. 2 September 2008 The military was called in to secure the situation, but not to disperse the demonstrators. The UDD was then seen by the public as the main adversary of the PAD, the red/yellow rivalry becoming evident.  2009 unrest  In March 2009, Thaksin Shinawatra claimed via a video broadcast to a UDD rally that Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda masterminded the 2006 military coup, and that Prem and fellow Privy Councillor members Surayud Chulanont and Chanchai Likhitjittha conspired with the military and other members of the \\"Ammatayathipatai\\" (‡∏≠‡∏≥‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏ò‡∏¥‡∏õ‡πÑ‡∏ï‡∏¢‚Äîaristocratic polity) to ensure that Abhisit became premier.

On 22 April, a series of explosions in Bangkok killed at least one person and injured more than 85 others, including four foreigners. At least some of the explosions were caused by grenades, which the government claimed were fired from the Red Shirt encampment. On 28 April, Thai security forces and anti-government protesters clashed on the outskirts of Bangkok, with troops firing both over and then directly into a crowd of red shirts to keep them from expanding their demonstrations. At least 16 protesters were wounded and one soldier was killed. The soldier was found to have been shot in the back by another soldier in a case of friendly fire.

The film premiered along with Zhang's Seventeen Years at the 1999 Locarno International Film Festival. It established Zhang's position as a \\"legitimate\\" director after years of working independently from, and often at odds with, the Chinese authorities. In contrast to earlier films, like East Palace, West Palace (1997), Crazy English was produced with the cooperation of the state-owned Xi'an Film Studio, which enjoys a \\"presented by\\" billing in the film's credits.  Subject  The film follows one of the People's Republic of China's most popular motivational speakers, Li Yang, the founder of \\"Crazy English\\". Li is known for his stadium-sized presentations where he exhorts his audiences to engage in mass recitations of English phrases and idioms, often with a strong nationalist bent: \\"Conquer English to Make China Stronger!\\". Li, however, has also courted controversy. Despite the fact that he teaches a foreign language, Li has never left China, a fact not revealed in the film until the end. Other common criticisms, including accusations that Li Yang is a \\"nationalist huckster\\" and that his methods do not actually improve English- speaking ability, receive a much more subtle presentation in Zhang's film. The film follows Li on his tours throughout China with a few interspersed interviews. Zhang Yuan has described the film as a combination of Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will and Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump.Berry, Michael (2005). \\"Wording up a Sweat in a Celluloid Sauna\\" in Speaking in Images: Interviews with Contemporary Chinese Filmmakers. Columbia University Press, p. 144. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 2008-08-30.  Production history  The seeds for Crazy English first arose when Li Yang's manager asked to meet with Zhang Yuan at a bar in Beijing's Sanlitun neighborhood. At the time Zhang Yuan had not even heard of Li Yang or his \\"Crazy English\\" programs.Berry, p. 152. After meeting with the manager, Zhang was sufficiently intrigued by the idea of a documentary about Li to arrange for an actual meeting with the motivational speaker. Once the two men met, Zhang Yuan \\"immediately\\" decided to make the film. Though made with the assent of official authorities, the filmmakers were nevertheless forced to make certain cutsTasker, Yvonne (2002). \\"Zhang Yuan\\" in Fifty Contemporary Filmmakers. Routledge Publishing, p. 427. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 2008-08-30. before being allowed a limited release for their documentary. Zhang has noted that his own opinions of Li Yang vary dramatically from admiration to disgust. One critic also noticed Zhang's ambivalence in the film and noted that the film seems to shift from appreciation or amusement at Li Yang's methodologies to one darker in tone, as Li Yang's mass rallies begin to resemble Mao-era Red Guard rallies or even Hitler's Nuremberg Rally.  Reception  Despite of its official approval, Crazy English received only a limited release in select cities within China.Berry, p. 153 Zhang Yuan has stated that the film's reception within China was difficult to read, given the mass adoration (and criticism) that Li Yang often elicits. While China remained ambivalent, the west also responded to Crazy English with mixed reactions. At least one critic felt that the film was too long and better suited for television than film. On the other hand, the film journal Senses of Cinema showered praise on Crazy English, saying, \\"This is a fascinating film - for China watchers, for educators and for fans of the documentary film - and is an absolute must for festival patrons.\\" As for the film's subject, Li Yang was reportedly less than pleased by the film's portrayal of him as a demagogue, and he has gone on to say that the film was \\"not a real documentary\\" accusing Zhang of manipulating the film to appeal to Western audiences.

Chris Barrett, a professor of agriculture at Cornell University, claims that the average Panamanian eats 130 bananas every year. Information Bananas were the leading export item, and in 1985 accounted for 23 percent (US$78 million) of total exports. In that year, the Chiriqu√≠ Land Company, a subsidiary of United Brands (formerly United Fruit Company), produced 70 percent of all bananas, followed by private Panamanian producers (25 percent) and the state-owned Corporaci√≥n Bananera del Atl√°ntico (5 percent). The volume of bananas produced in Panama peaked in 1978 and slowly declined in the 1980s.Panama Agriculture, Online version of book published by Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress. Retrieved 30 May 2014. Observers doubted that United Brands would expand its production in Panama because bananas could be produced more cheaply in Costa Rica and Ecuador. History The history of banana production in Panama virtually coincides with that of United Brands, which has been in Panama since 1899. The company built railroads, port facilities, and storage areas for the processing and export of bananas.The Other Side Of Bocas Life on A Banana Plantation, Panama Q Online. Retrieved 30 May 2014. In the 1930s, a disease seriously curtailed banana production. In the 1950s, a disease began killing off the banana crops in Panama. The disease was caused by Fungus grown around the area. During the disease, Panamanians switched to Cavendish bananas, because the disease didn't affect those kind. In the early 1970s, a \\"banana war\\" erupted when banana-producing countries disagreed among themselves and with United Brands about an export tax on bananas. Panama threatened to take over United Brands' plantations. An agreement was reached in 1976 to tax banana exports. In that year, the tax provided the government with US$10 million, nearly 4 percent of all revenues. In addition, United Brands sold all of land that it owned in Panama to the government; payment was in tax credits. The government leased back to United Brands over for banana production and export operations. Part of the excess land went to the government's newly established banana companies. On June 1, 2017, Del Monte began a 20-year contract with Panama in order to grow Bananas in the Baru district, in Chiriqui. The president Juan Carlos Varela approved the deal.

It is located approximately 75 miles northeast of the city of Lviv, Ukraine. In the past it was a town of ≈öwiniuchy ( Svyniukhy, Svinekh).  History  Judaism in Swiniuchy Jews first settled here in the 16th century. By the year 1897, 629 Jews lived here out of a total of 1,780 people. During World War I, many Jews left the shtetl because of nearby fighting. In 1921, only 173 Jews were living here. Due to a high birth rate, as most of the Jewish citizens of ≈öwiniuchy belonged to the orthodox sects of Olyka and Tuczyn Hasidism, the Jewish population grew to 498 by 1936. In July 1941, the Ukrainian local government police persecuted the Jews of ≈öwiniuchy after being ordered to by the Nazi invaders. During October of that year, they were sent to the Lokachi ghetto where they were executed on September 13, 1942. The diary of Michael Diment, the only known survivor of the liquidation of the Jewish population of Swiniuchy is a moving account of the last days of the community. See Michael Diment, The Lone Survivor: A Diary of the Lukacze Ghetto and Svyniukhy, Ukraine (1992), published by the Holocaust Library in New York. There are known descendants of the Jews of ≈öwiniuchy living in the United States. Specifically there were former Swiniuchy residents and their descendants who settled in the area of Detroit and Flint Michigan, along with branches of those families scattered in Pittsburgh PA, Toledo OH, and Baltimore, Maryland, and New York City. Very early in its history, the Baltimore community formed a landesmanschaft (organization of Jews from a particular area in Europe) known as the Swiniche Woliner (Volhynya) Benevolent Association, which persists to this day. An extensive family tree of the Schafer family (which comes from Swiniuchy) can be found at http://www.schaferfamily.org. There are also descendants of this family living in Israel. Life in Pre-War Swiniuchy Swiniuchy was an old town with a laid-back feel. As typical of the region, homes were decaying rustic whitewashed clay huts lit by kerosene lamps. The village was, of course, centered on trade. Poles, Ukrainians, and Jews alike shared the small shtetl, living together, though with suspicions. Food was cheap, most of the Jews were observant, and basically all of them were below the poverty line. Also, there was no generation gap, as it was such a small, close-knitted community. Homes were worn, white clay, with thatched roofs.http://www.kimel.net/podhajce.html  See also  *History of Jews in Ukraine *Ashkenazi Jews *Pale of Settlement *Holocaust References  External links  * http://www.kimel.net/podhajce.html Villages in Lokachi Raion Volhynian Voivodeship (1569‚Äì1795) Holocaust locations in Ukraine ","title":"Pryvitne"},{"id":"19107542","text":"During the off-season Nickelodeon advertised a competition called \\"R U All That?: Nickelodeon's Search for the Funniest Kid in America\\". It was a nationwide search to find a new cast member. The judges happened to be former cast members Amanda Bynes and Nick Cannon; Josh Peck was also a judge. After this contest ended in early 2003, the finals aired on July 26, 2003. The contest picked five finalists, and all of them performed a sketch with some of the cast members. The winner was Christina Kirkman, who joined the show in the season opener and replaced Bryan Hearne. Ryan Coleman, the runner up in the contest, joined mid season as a replacement for Jamie Lynn Spears after she left to star on Zoey 101. Ratings wise the show was not doing well. In order to raise ratings the producers brought back old fan favorite sketches, like mous character Ed, they put in Coleman in a test skit. They thought the fit would work, resulting in the revision of the skit. This would be the final season for Shane Lyons, Giovonnie Samuels, and Jamie Lynn Spears. Shane Lyons left All That after opting not to renew his contract. Giovonnie Samuels left because she felt was too old to be on All That, similar to original cast member Lori Beth Denberg exiting after Season 4. Jamie Lynn left to star in her own Nickelodeon show Zoey 101, a show also created by Dan Schneider. The cast of Season 9 continued to do On-Air Dares. Like the last season. The intro was changed for this season. This time the cast is in the same place. They are dancing in a dark room with the All That logo in the back. It is lighted up. The cast however is now wearing red, unlike that of white in Seasons 7 and 8. The \\"Oh\\" sign was brought back, Brummet and Kirkman both held the sign in the intro. It is similar to the previous two seasons. The intro was changed to accommodate Coleman's entry onto the show. This is the first season since Season 3 to have more female cast members then male and the last season to do so. In 2004, All That won another KCA for Best TV show at the 2004 Kids' Choice Awards.

His primary vocation was in agriculture. In the 1930s, Fujii was recognized as a pioneer in large-scale onion farming, advancing the acreage scale of which a farmer could raise crops.Hayashi, Robert T. (2007). Haunted By Waters, pp. 59, 62-65, 73, 126-130. In 1936, he established the Japanese Onion Growers Association and served as the organization's president for over 30 years. As a Japanese immigrant living away from the West Coast of the United States, Fujii was not part of the Japanese American internment, maintaining a residence in Nampa, Idaho throughout World War II.Henshall, Mary S. (1973). \\"Henry Fujii Interview\\", JACL Convention, Boise, Idaho; Idaho Historical Museum File 0H#0037, November 24, 1973 Although he, like most other Japanese Americans, was the subject of significant racial persecution in the mid-1940s, Fujii maintained strong community relationships and leadership.Henshall, Mary. (1975). \\"Pioneer Portraits: Henry and Fumiko Fujii,\\" Idaho Yesteryears (Spring 1975). pp. 20-27. His community presence served as a significant contributor to the well-being and rights preservation for Asians in the northwestern United States. The Emperor of Japan awarded Fujii the 6th Order of the Rising Sun, Silver Rays, which represents the sixth highest of eight classes associated with this award. This decoration was presented as a way of acknowledging his efforts in furthering the relationships between Japan and the United States.\\"Community News,\\" Idaho Free Press & Caldwell News-Tribune. July 19, 1971, p. 8. In his retirement, Fujii turned to rockhounding and amassed one of the most extensive gem and mineral collections in the northwestern United States.Penson, Betty. \\"Japanese Amasses Famed Rock Exhibit,\\" Idaho Statesman. July 27, 1986. In 1974, Fujii donated a portion of his collection to the State of Idaho, with Governor Cecil D. Andrus personally accepting the donation.Idaho, Division of Tourism and Industrial Development. (1977). \\"People and Culture,\\" Idaho Almanac. p. 324. Background Hajimu Fujii was born August 17, 1886 in Tottori Prefecture, Japan. He was the fifth son to Yasujiro and Tsune Fujii. As a boy, he helped raise rice and silkworms on their one-ox, farm. In high school, Fujii and some friends decide to immigrate to America upon finishing school. Hajimu, whose name means \\"The Beginning,\\" didn't pass his physical examination because of an eye infection, so his classmate, Katsuji Hashitani, went on to America alone. Fujii taught school for a year while returning to full health and borrowed $500 for his fare to America. Fujii left Japan for America at the beginning of April 1906 on the ship Keemun. After an 18-day voyage he arrived in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. He continued on his journey by train to Vancouver, British Columbia, finally arriving in Seattle, Washington on May 1 where he joined Hashitani. Hashitani told Fujii that his first name was difficult for Americans to pronounce, so he'd taken the name Henry. Hajimu, not knowing any other common U.S. names, took the name Henry as well. In December 1908, Fujii partnered with Hashitani and George Shigeya Takeuchi, assuming a lease of an farm and house in Emmett, ID. They raised vegetables and fruit, and supplied produce by horse and wagon to the town of Emmett, and Pearl, a nearby gold mine camp. During each winter farming off-season, Fujii, Hashitani, and Takeuchi studied English, taking lessons three nights a week with a local church pastor.Fujii, Edson, Fujii, Lorraine (2008). \\"A New Partnership,\\" Okagesama: An American Dream, Fooj Entertainment, July 17, 2008. Within five years of arriving in the U.S., Fujii had paid back the $500 he had borrowed to come to America and amassed $500 in savings, as well as funding to return to Japan to get married. On December 29, 1911, he married Fumiko Mayeda at Takashiro, Tottori-ken, Japan. Fumiko Mayeda was born on July 12, 1891 at Kochi, Maniwa, Okayama Prefecture, Japan. She was the daughter of a history teacher Fujii had admired when he was a teacher. Fujii returned to the U.S. with his new bride, traveling aboard the SS Inaba Maru and arriving on April 23, 1912.Alexander, Mrs. Robert, Hungerford, Mrs. Cecil (1971). \\"Henry and Fumiko Interview\\", Boise: Idaho Oral Historical Center, August 23, 1971 Japanese land law Fujii's ability to purchase land was partly due to his own efforts in fighting the alien land law that had been introduced in the Idaho State Legislature in 1915. Eight years after joining the Japanese Association of Western Idaho (JAWI), Fujii was elected president. His election was the beginning of a 26-year leadership for the JAWI. The association's usual activities involved such matters as arranging trips to Japan, marriages, funerals, and buying property. One of the most serious matters of the JAWI was that of the Japanese land law. California, Oregon, Washington, and other western states had passed laws that prohibited Japanese from owning or leasing land. Idaho's five Japanese associations organized a federation and elected Fujii, as well as other representatives, to fight a similar law in Idaho. This team successfully lobbied to delay passage of the law, defeat it, and introduce a new law. This new law allowed renewable leases of up to five years. With its passage in 1923, Idaho remained the only state in the West where Japanese immigrants could lease land.Nagasaka, Diane, Fujii, Lorraine (2008). \\"Land Law,\\" Okagesama: An American Dream, Fooj Entertainment, July 17, 2008 Notes References * Idaho, Division of Tourism and Industrial Development.

For ten years, she operated between Oban and the Outer Isles. Between October 2002 and March 2009, she was the Pentland Ferries relief vessel on the Short Sea Crossing to Orkney. Since March 2009, she has operated, as MV Sia, a RORO cable-laying and supply vessel. History MV Claymore was built by Robb Caledon, Leith for Caledonian MacBrayne and launched on 31 August 1978. The third ferry to bear the name Claymore, she entered service between Oban and the Outer Isles. She was out of service for the three months in 1982 after running into rocks at the entrance to Lochboisdale harbour. A collision in 1986 resulted in significant bow damage. She performed the annual Govan Shipbuilders charter with a flat plate welded across the damaged area. It was painted black with a large yellow CalMac lion to make it look less odd. Claymore at Castlebay, Barra (1985) Sia at Port of Amsterdam (2011) The cafeteria was refurbished in 1997 when sold to Sea Containers. On 11 March 2003, in gale force winds, Claymore was blown away from her intended berth in St Margaret‚Äôs Hope Bay. Her starboard propeller became entangled in the moorings of smaller vessels and the 12 passengers were disembarked safely by the Longhope Lifeboat. The subsequent investigation by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) made several recommendations to improve safety. In March 2009 Claymore was sold to CT Offshore ApS, a Danish shipping company and moved to Svendborg. She was renamed Sia on 29 April 2009. The new owners added 4x 600 kW auxiliary engines to supply 4 forward thrusters and 3 aft thrusters, giving dynamic positioning capability for her new cable-laying role. She now appears to have a new name \\"Ocean Link\\", and is currently operating around Albania. Layout Claymore is a larger half-sister to , built by the same shipyard. She has four decks of accommodation including saloons, bars and cabins for 32 passengers. The ticket office is forward of the car deck. The cafeteria is above the lounge bar, reached by two sets of stairs outside the bar. The toilets are next to these stairs. She had room for 50 cars, loaded via a stern ramp and a 36-ton hoist. The hoist was removed in December 2007. Service Claymore entered service on the Outer Isles route from Oban. She remained on this route for ten years, sailing to Barra and Lochboisdale. She made calls at Tobermory, Lochaline on the Morvern coastline, and Coll and Tiree on alternate days. Claymore was transferred to the Kennacraig - Islay service in 1989, and in 1993 became CalMac's spare summer vessel. During the summer of 1993 she was on the Clyde, seeing service at Rothesay, Dunoon and Brodick. In 1994 and 1995 Claymore provided weekend voyages to Douglas, Isle of Man. For this service she was given an International Passenger Certificate for 300. She was the first vessel to use hoist loading on the Isle of Man. In September 1995 Claymore became the first CalMac vessel to visit Wales, under charter to the Hamilton Oil Company. She became probably the most travelled member of the CalMac fleet, visiting twenty-four terminals in total in 1996, her last full year with the company. In May 1997 Claymore was sold to Argyll and Antrim Steam Packet Company, a subsidiary of Sea Containers (Scotland) Ltd. For three years Claymore operated a new summer sailing from Campbeltown to Ballycastle, Northern Ireland, providing winter overhaul relief for CalMac under charter. On termination of the Ballycastle service, she was moved to Birkenhead and put on the market. She carried out a five-week charter to the Faroe Islands in June 2000. Andrew Banks of Pentland Ferries bought Claymore for the service between St Margaret's Hope, Orkney and Gills Bay, Caithness in October 2002, where she joined the former CalMac vessel, Iona, since renamed . On occasions her passengers numbers were limited to twelve. During the summer of 2006 she was employed on short-term charter as a livestock carrier between Dover and Calais.

The \\"Banning Era\\" The Banning brothers of Wilmington played a huge role in transportation to the island even before their purchase of it in 1891. The Bannings owned the Wilmington Transportation Company, and provided the steamships used to deliver tourists from Los Angeles to the island's city of Avalon. When they eventually bought the island in 1891, their company had already provided the necessary transportation to Catalina. However, with new technology and a growing population of visitors, steamships were being replaced quite frequently. The Banning brothers, who now owned the island, showed even more interest in improving passenger service to Catalina. So they designed two steamships specifically for the Catalina run. The first was the SS Hermosa II, followed by the SS Cabrillo. Once the construction of the Hermosa II was underway, the Bannings soon realized that the ship would not be big enough to accommodate the island's growing tourism. Before the launch of the Hermosa, plans for the construction of the SS Cabrillo had already begun. On February 15, 1904, early in the morning, the Cabrillo was launched and, at the time, was the finest ship on the run. The Bannings had hoped for a ship that was faster, bigger, and better in every way, and that is just what the Cabrillo was. She could carry up to 1,200 passengers. With a luxurious interior, a social hall, 10 staterooms, and food service on the main deck, the SS Cabrillo immediately became the favorite ship amongst the general public traveling to Catalina. The \\"Wrigley Era\\" During the turn of the century, the Bannings ran into financial problems with loss of tourism due to World War I and the fire of 1915 that destroyed more than half of Avalon. With failed attempts to rebuild, the Bannings were forced to sell the island in shares. William Wrigley Jr., the inventor of chewing gum, fell in love with the island and bought out all the shares from owners until he owned all of Catalina Island. He soon rebuilt all of Avalon, and Catalina was back in business. During this era, the island was starting to become world known, resulting in a massive increase in tourism. The SS Hermosa II and the SS Cabrillo were not at all ready for what was coming their way. Mr. Wrigley understood this and had a plan that would change Catalina forever. Sailing with the great whites William Wrigley Jr. understood the great importance of water transportation to the island. He wanted there to be a balance between comfort, convenience, and magnificence. His plan was to add two more ships to the fleet. The first ship he introduced was the in 1920, followed by the in 1924. Both ships were far faster than the Cabrillo, held large ballrooms and could carry close to 2,000 passengers. The SS Cabrillo was then used, only, for passenger service to the Isthmus at Twin Harbors. With the demise of the SS Hermosa II; the SS Cabrillo, SS Avalon, and SS Catalina were the only steamships to, ever again, be used on the Catalina run. World War II With the outbreak of World War II, the island was taken over by the U.S. military, as well as all of the ships of the Wilmington Transportation Company. The SS Avalon was left behind for limited transportation to and from the mainland, while the SS Catalina and SS Cabrillo were taken to San Francisco Bay to serve as troop transports in the bay and surrounding areas. After the war had ended, the SS Catalina was taken back to be used for ferry services to and from the island, while the Cabrillo was purchased by the U.S. Army who operated her until 1947 where she was brought to the Cuttings Wharf in Napa, California. Steamer Cabrillo at Avalon Current state The SS Cabrillo was put up for sale, but there were no buyers, so she was left in the Cuttings Wharf. Being stripped of all machinery and any other useful equipment, she was abandoned on the shores of the Napa River, beginning the final chapter of her life. Over the years, she has slowly deteriorated to almost nothing. She has been stripped of her entire superstructure, and today, nothing, if anything, is left but the hull.

Jediism attracted public attention in 2001 when a number of people recorded their religion as \\"Jedi\\" on national censuses. Jediism is inspired by certain elements of Star Wars, namely the fictional religion of the Jedi. Early websites dedicated to bringing up a belief system from the Star Wars films were \\"The Jedi Religion and regulations\\" and \\"Jediism\\". These websites cited the Jedi code, consisting of 21 maxims, as the starting point for a \\"real Jedi\\" belief system. The real-world Jediism movement has no leader or central structure.  Beliefs  Although followers of Jediism acknowledge the influence of Star Wars on their religion, by following the moral and spiritual codes demonstrated by the fictional Jedi, they also insist their path is different from that of the fictional characters and that Jediism does not focus on the myth and fiction found in Star Wars. While there is some variation in teaching, the Jedi of the Temple of the Jedi Order follows the \\"16 teachings\\" based on the presentation of the fictional Jedi, such as \\"Jedi are mindful of the negative emotions which lead to the Dark Side\\" and \\"Jedi are guardians of peace and justice\\". Adherents also follow \\"21 maxims\\".  Census phenomenon  Jediism received press coverage following a worldwide email campaign in 2001 urging people to write \\"Jedi\\" as their answer to the religion classification question in their country's census, resulting in the Jedi census phenomenon. The majority of such respondents are assumed to have claimed the faith as a joke.  Legal recognition   United States  In 2005, the Temple of the Jedi Order was registered in Texas. It was granted IRS tax exemption in 2015. In May 2005 an article on the growth of Jedi religion by Catholic author, Jon M. Sweeney, was the most read article on the website Explorefaith.org that year.http://www.explorefaith.org/news/05_17_05.html  United Kingdom  During the drafting of the UK Racial and Religious Hatred Act, an amendment was proposed that excluded Jedi Knights from any protection, along with Satanists and believers in animal sacrifice. The amendment was subsequently withdrawn, the proposer explaining that it was \\"a bit of a joke\\" to illustrate a point that defining religious belief in legislation is difficult. In 2007, 23-year-old Daniel Jones founded The Church of Jediism with his brother Barney, believing that the 2001 UK census recognised Jediism as a religion, and that there were \\"more Jedi than Scientologists in Britain\\". In 2009, Jones was removed from a Tesco supermarket in Bangor, North Wales, for refusing to remove his hood on a religious basis. The owner justified Jones's ejection by saying, \\"He hasn't been banned. Jedis are very welcome to shop in our stores although we would ask them to remove their hoods. Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and Luke Skywalker all appeared hoodless without ever going over to the Dark Side and we are only aware of the Emperor as one who never removed his hood.\\" In 2013, the Free Church of Scotland expressed concern that a proposed Marriage and Civil Partnership bill would \\"lead to Star Wars Jedi marrying couples\\". Patrick Day-Childs of The Church of Jediism, and Rev Michael Kitchen of Temple of the Jedi Order, both defended the right of Jedi to perform marriage ceremonies.McKenzie, Steven \\"Star chores: Do Jedi want to marry people?\\", BBC News, London, 20 March 2013. Retrieved on 14 June 2014.Hudson, Tony \\"Marry you, I will: Jedi strike back over weddings criticism\\", Politics UK, 25 March 2013. Retrieved on 14 June 2014. In December 2016, the Charity Commission for England and Wales rejected an application to grant charitable organization status to The Temple of the Jedi Order, ruling that the group did not \\"promote moral or ethical improvement\\" for charity law purposes.  Turkey  In April 2015, the students of Dokuz Eyl√ºl University in Turkey started a petition on Change.org demanding a Jedi temple be built on the campus. The petition was in response to a previous petition which had demanded a mosque on the campus of Istanbul Technical University (ƒ∞T√ú). The petition demanding the mosque reached 180,000 signatures, falling short of its 200,000 target, and invoked a response from Mehmet Karaca, the rector of Istanbul Technical University (ƒ∞T√ú), promising \\"a landmark mosque\\". Soon after, students from other universities started petitions demanding Jedi and Buddhist temples on their campuses.

Louis I of Anhalt-K√∂then (; 17 June 1579 in Dessau ‚Äì 7 January 1650 in K√∂then), was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the unified principality of Anhalt. From 1603, he was ruler of the principality of Anhalt-K√∂then. He was also a founder of the first German Society (the Fruitbearing Society). Louis was the seventh son of Joachim Ernest, Prince of Anhalt, but fifth-born son of his second wife Eleonore, daughter of Christoph, Duke of W√ºrttemberg. Life After the death of his father in 1586, Louis inherited the principality of Anhalt jointly with his half- and full brothers. The youngest of all the sons of Joachim Ernest who survived adulthood, he grew up in Dessau at the court of his older brother and guardian, John George I. From 1596 to 1597 the seventeen-year-old Louis made a Grand Tour of Europe by traveling to Great Britain, France, and the Netherlands. By the beginning of 1598 he was in Switzerland, then visited Austria, Hungary, and Italy, where he remained until 1602. During a stay in Florence, Louis was accepted (with the assistance of his Italian tutor Bastiano de' Rossi) as the first German member of the Accademia della Crusca, in which he was known by the name \\"L'Acceso.\\" In 1603 a formal division of the principality of Anhalt was agreed upon by the surviving co-rulers. Louis received K√∂then, where he took up his principal residence. Militarily and politically Louis remained cautious, preferring to promote agriculture vigorously. He built his new Schloss (official residence) in Italian style and had his court adopt Italian manners. With his financial support, a major educational initiative was launched in K√∂then in 1619 under the auspices of Wolfgang Ratke. Problems with the local clergy led to Ratke's imprisonment for eight months, and Louis left this project incomplete. On the occasion of the funeral of his sister Dorothea Maria, Duchess of Saxe-Weimar, on 24 August 1617, the seneschal Kaspar von Teutleben proposed the establishment of a society on the model of the Accademia della Crusca. The creation of the Fruitbearing Society was decided upon and Louis was appointed its first leader, a post he held until his death. As a member, Louis used the Latin motto \\"Vita mihi Christ, morse lucrum.\\" During the Thirty Years' War, King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden transferred the governorship of the Dioceses of Magdeburg and Halberstadt to Louis. This provoked the anger of Count Axel Oxenstierna, who desired that post. This was also a source of tension in the Fruitbearing Society, because Oxenstierna was a member. Marriages and Issue In Rheda on 31 October 1606 Louis married Am√∂ena Amalie (born Bentheim, 19 March 1586 ‚Äì d. Oldenburg, 8 September 1625), daughter of Arnold III, Count of Bentheim-Steinfurt-Tecklenburg-Limburg, and younger sister of Anna, the wife of Prince Christian I of Anhalt-Bernburg, Louis's older brother. They had two children: #Louis, Hereditary Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then (born K√∂then, 19 October 1607 ‚Äì d. K√∂then, 15 March 1624). #Louise Am√∂ena (born K√∂then, 28 November 1609 ‚Äì d. Harderwijk, Gelderland, 26 March 1625). The death of his only son left Louis without an heir, but it was only after the death of his wife eighteen months later that he decided to find a new wife who bore the needed heir to his principality. In Detmold on 12 September 1626 Louis married for a second time to Sophie (born Detmold, 16 August 1599 ‚Äì d. K√∂then, 19 March 1654), daughter of Simon VI, Count of Lippe.

It is native to the Southeastern United States, where it is listed as an endangered species in several states. Description Lysimachia fraseri is a rhizomatous perennial herb reaching about in maximum height, or taller in moist conditions. It has a slender, erect stem coated in black-tipped glandular hairs, especially near each whorl of leaves. The whorls are composed of 3 to 6 leaves each on the upper stem, and the leaves toward the base are paired oppositely. The leaves are lance-shaped to nearly oval in shape and up to 15 centimeters long. They are dotted with black glands and there is a narrow but usually distinct dark or reddish strip along the margin of each leaf. The inflorescence is up to 25 centimeters long with many flowers, each just over a centimeter wide. The lance-shaped sepals are glandular and outlined in red like the leaves. The flat face of the flower is made up of five yellow oval petals. The fruit is a capsule containing many brown seeds. This species is similar in appearance to other Lysimachia species; it can often be distinguished from them by its solid yellow petals and the granular appearance of the glandular hairs on its upper stem and foliage.Patrick, Allison and Krakow. (1995). Protected Plants of Georgia. Georgia Department of Natural Resources. Distribution Lysimachia fraseri grows in areas near water, such as gravelly river banks and ditches, and thrives in disturbed areas, undergoing cycles of increase and decrease as it takes over cleared land and is shaded out by taller plants.NatureServe Species Profile When the growing plant is exposed to sun through a break in the canopy it grows robustly. Plants growing in shaded situations are often sterile. As the species depends on the sunlight in open areas for its fertility, human suppression of wildfire leading to the overgrowth of canopy is a threat to its success.Heikens, A.L. (2003).

The album is Hansson's fourth solo album and is, as its name suggests, built around musical ideas inspired by Richard Adams' heroic fantasy novel Watership Down. It was the second album of Hansson's to have been based on a novel; his first solo album, Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings, had likewise been based on J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. Hansson had already composed and released a musical suite inspired by Watership Down on his previous album Attic Thoughts. However, beyond its title, the Music Inspired by Watership Down album contains few overt references to the novel and instead features excerpts from the works of various poets, such as John Keats and Alexander Pope. Music Inspired by Watership Down was originally released in Sweden as El-Ahrairah by YTF Records in 1977. This title was taken directly from the pages of Watership Down, with El-Ahrairah being the name of a trickster, folk hero-deity rabbit, known as \\"The Prince with a Thousand Enemies\\". The album was subsequently released with its English title by Charisma Records in the United Kingdom and Sire Records in the United States, but it failed to chart on either side of the Atlantic.

Early life Lorna was born in Saligao, Goa on 9 August 1944 to Cecelia and Teofilo Cordeiro, the third child born in a family of three boys and three girls. Her siblings were Elvino, Albert, Jean, Oscar, Salvador and Clementine. Her sister Jean was also a crooner in a different band. Their ancestral house in Saligao is in Tabravaddo; the family would often visit after they moved to Bombay. Lorna belongs to the Goan Catholic community; Fr. Nascimento Mascarenhas, their immediate neighbour in Goa, recalls being very impressed by the family's singing of Konkani hymns after the night Rosary. Lorna recalled how as a young girl another Parsi neighbour in Mumbai would clap and gift her four annas, whenever he heard her sing along with the radio. \\"My girl, one day you'll be a big singer,\\" he'd often say. Lorna's father Teofilo, came from a family of musicians and he always encouraged his children in music and to speak Konkani at home. Her mother, Cecelia, died on 4 March 2002, a month after her 89th birthday. Career Initial career (1960‚Äì1973) Lorna's singing career began by singing at weddings as part of a band called 'Bajaj and his Dance Band'. She was recognized by singer Raymond Albuquerque, who first heard her sing \\"Where The Boys Are\\" on Marv√© Beach. He then invited her to sing \\"Under the Mango Tree\\" from Dr. No with his band at the Bandra fair. This performance impressed Chris Perry, who was in the audience and had been looking for a crooner. After an audition, she began singing for Perry's band at the age of 15 and continued with them until she turned 26. He thus helped her launch her career and she regards him as her guru. She was a popular jazz singer in nightclubs and star hotels in Mumbai, Calcutta, Madras, Delhi and Bangalore. Later, she sang songs composed / arranged by Chris Perry. Lorna's first song was \\"Bebdo\\" (), which she performed on Miramar Beach, Goa, shocking the crowd with a song of this type in Konkani. She soon became well-known for her other songs, such as \\"Nachomia Kumpasar\\", \\"Pisso\\", \\"Red Rose\\", \\"Lisboa\\", \\"Adeus\\", \\"Tuzo Mog\\", \\"Noxibak Roddttam\\", \\"Abghat\\", \\"Calangute\\", \\"Aik Re Khobrankara\\", \\"Sorga Rajeant\\", \\"Pavsachea Tempar\\", \\"Amerikak Pavxi\\", \\"Sorg Tujea Dolleamni\\", \\"Tum Ani Hanv\\", \\"Ugddas\\" and \\"Mhoji Mai\\". She became so popular that the public started demanding just her solo performances from Perry, who bound her by contract to not perform with anyone else for twenty years. She subsequently left music for a period of 23 years after a disagreement with him when she was 26 years old. Comeback and other projects (1995‚Äìpresent) In 1995, music director Ronnie Monseratte, who had been a part of Perry's band, managed to convince her to sing again. After a year of hesitation, she agreed to perform in a concert titled 'Hello Lorna', which was directed by Monseratte. However, on the day of the first show at Miramar Beach, on 1 December 1995, Perry came to the venue and showed the media the contract that she had signed to not sing with anyone else and threatened legal proceedings. After hiring new musicians, the concert began with Lorna performing \\"Aikat Mazo Tavlo\\" (). The concert's songs were released in a 1996 album of the same name. In her illustrious career, Lorna has sung for many great Bollywood music directors such as Bappi Lahiri, Kalyanji-Anandji, Laxmikant‚ÄìPyarelal and Rajesh Roshan. She has even sung alongside Mohammed Rafi (\\"Maria\\") and Sudesh Bhosle. After her comeback, she has performed in countries of the Middle East like Dubai, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain and even in parts of Europe like London. She is seen performing in the 2004 Konkani film Aleesha, and the 2019 Konkani musical film, Kantaar, features Lorna singing some jazz songs. In popular culture Films * Bombay Velvet, the Bollywood film, is set in the 1960s and Lorna's voice was inspirational to Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma. Anurag Kashyap says that Anushka's character is a tribute to Lorna. * Nachom-ia Kumpasar (), is a Konkani film. It is based on the lives of jazz musicians Chris Perry and Lorna. The film takes its title from the name of a song by the two artists. The story is told through over 20 popular Konkani songs from the 1960s and 1970s that have been re-recorded for this film. It is set in the 1960s and is a tribute to the 'unsung' Konkani musicians of that era. Advertisements An international ad campaign by Nike for its cricket equipment featured a Konkani song \\"Rav Patrao Rav\\", sung by Ella Castellino, based on the song \\"Bebdo\\" as the theme music. The lyrics to the new song were written by Agnello Dias (who worked in the JWT advertising agency that made the ad) and it was recomposed by Ram Sampath. Lorna inaugurated \\"The Goan Sip\\" packaged drinking water. She appears in the advertisement campaign video singing in the tune of \\"Tuzo Mog\\". Awards and accolades * In 1997, she was awarded the title of Best Female Singer in Mumbai, alongside Alfred Rose, who won the title of Best Male Singer * In 2015, Lorna was presented with a Lifetime Achievement award at the \\"Film, Food, Fashion Festival\\", by Vishnu Wagh, then MLA and Vice- Chairman of Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG). * In 2018, she was awarded the Krutadnyata Puraskar (Lifetime Achievement Award) at the 11th Goa Marathi Film Festival, held at Kala Academy. Discography Studio albums * Hello Lorna (1996) Singles Some of the popular songs sung by her are: * \\"Aikat mazo tavlo\\" * \\"Nachomia Kumpasar\\" * \\"Pisso\\" * \\"Bebdo\\" * \\"Red Rose\\" * \\"Lisboa\\" * \\"Adeus\\" * \\"Tuzo Mog\\" * \\"Noxibak Roddttam\\" * \\"Maria\\", with Mohammed Rafi * \\"Sorga Rajeant\\" * \\"Abghat\\" * \\"Aik re khobrankara\\" * \\"Amerikak Pavxi\\" * \\"Sorg Tujea Dolleamni\\" * \\"Tum Ani Hanv\\" * \\"Ugddas\\" * \\"Mhoji Mai\\" * \\"Calangute\\" * \\"Pavsachea Tempar\\" Personal life Lorna was in a brief relationship with Chris Perry while they were both working together. However, after their disagreement on her 27th birthday, in 1973, she did not perform for nearly 23 years, mainly because Perry would threaten or even strike anyone who would approach her to sing. This extended to any possible suitors, too. She began working as a compounder in a dentist's clinic, and was a victim of alcohol abuse before Ronnie Monserrate convinced her to start singing again in 1995. She now lives in Dhobitalao, Mumbai.

He graduated from the Benjamin School in North Palm Beach, Florida in 1989. In college, Rooney played football for Syracuse University and Washington & Jefferson College outside of Pittsburgh where he earned his B.A. in English Literature. He was a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. Rooney attended the University of Florida where he received his M.A. in Political Science. After that he went to the University of Miami School of Law where he received his J.D. and met his wife Tara Lombardi. They became members of The Florida Bar in 1999. He is not related to fellow Republican representative Francis Rooney. Military career After law school, both Rooney and his wife joined the U.S. Army JAG Corps. In 2001, Tom and Tara, along with their newborn son, were stationed at Fort Hood on 9/11. Rooney spent over four years on Active Duty in the United States Army JAG Corps. He served as Special Assistant U.S Attorney at Fort Hood in Texas, prosecuting all civilian crimes on post. Rooney also served in the 1st Cavalry Division. In 2002, Rooney began teaching Constitutional and Criminal Law as an Asst. Prof. in the Dept. of Law at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He received two Army Commendation Medals for his service. Tom and Tara Rooney each completed active duty with the rank of Captain. During his active duty time in the JAG Corps, he served with fellow future Congressman Patrick Murphy, a Democrat from Pennsylvania who was the first Iraq War veteran elected to the U.S. Congress. Early political career As his first job out of college, Tom Rooney worked for U.S. Senator Connie Mack III, who had worked with Tom's father, Patrick J. Rooney Sr., at one time. Tom started in Senator Mack's mailroom: \\"We opened every letter and that's where I learned what people's issues were. It really helped shape a blank slate in my life.\\" After getting his Masters, he returned to Florida, where he went to work as an Assistant Attorney General. While working as a criminal prosecutor for Attorney General Charlie Crist, he joined the Board of Directors with \\"The Children's Place at Home Safe,\\" a Palm Beach County shelter that helps abused, neglected, and abandoned children. In 2005, Tom was named CEO of Home Safe and because of his work there, Governor Jeb Bush appointed Rooney to the Children's Services Council of Palm Beach County Board of Directors in January 2006. After his second year as director, Rooney returned to the Board of Directors of Children's Place and resumed his practice of law in Stuart, Florida with the law firm of Kramer, Sopko & Levenstein, P.A. He is a graduate of Leadership Palm Beach County. U.S. House of Representatives Elections ;2008: Rooney challenged Democratic incumbent Tim Mahoney. Mahoney had narrowly won the Republican-leaning district in 2006, after five- term incumbent Mark Foley abruptly resigned under a cloud of scandal. Since Foley resigned a little more than a month before the election, Florida election law required Foley's name to remain on the general election ballot, with votes for him being transferred to his replacement, State Representative Joe Negron. It was widely believed that this significantly undermined Negron's chances, as many voters would be reluctant to cast a ballot in Foley's name.GOP Picks Negron to Replace Foley on Florida Ballot FOXnews, October 3, 2006. The campaign used the slogan 'Punch Foley for Negron' as a means of educating the public about the ballot situation and as a means of differentiating the two men, making voting for Foley more palatable. Given Mahoney's narrow margin of victory, coupled with the unusual circumstances surrounding the 2006 election and this district's Republican bent, the 16th District was viewed as one of Republicans' best opportunities to take a congressional seat from the Democrats in 2008. In the Republican Party primary, Rooney was endorsed by Florida's Governor, Charlie Crist, and defeated State Representative Gayle Harrell and investment banker Hal Valeche. Mahoney, aided by incumbency and having burnished his image as a moderate Blue Dog Democrat, consistently led Rooney in polls throughout the 2008 election cycle until mid-October 2008, when it was revealed that Mahoney, who had promoted a family values image and campaigned against corruption in contrast to the disgraced Foley, had engaged in multiple extramarital affairs and secretly paid off his mistresses to conceal them. This revelation shifted the race decisively in Rooney's favor, even causing the Palm Beach Post to take the rare step of rescinding its previous endorsement of Mahoney and endorsing Rooney instead. ;2010: Rooney ran unopposed in the Republican primary. In the general election, he defeated Democratic nominee Jim Horn and write-in candidate William Dean. ;2012: For his first two terms, Rooney represented a district stretching from the Treasure Coast through the Everglades to Port Charlotte on the other side of the state. Redistricting, however, saw the 16th renumbered as the 18th District and made significantly more compact. It lost most of its heavily Republican western portion to the new 17th District, which stretched from the Everglades to the outer suburbs of Tampa. Rooney opted to run for reelection in the 17th. He retained roughly one-third of his previous constituents. Most of them lived in the western portion of the old 16th. He sold his home in Tequesta, which remained in the 18th, and bought a home in Okeechobee as his official residence in the new 17th. In the August 14 Republican primary‚Äîthe real contest in this heavily Republican district‚ÄîRooney faced Joe Arnold, a Republican state committeeman for Okeechobee County and member of the school board. Rooney defeated Arnold in a landslide, getting 74% of vote. Rooney ran in the general election against a retired airline pilot, Democrat William Bronson (formerly an unsuccessful Republican candidate in Massachusetts and Georgia) as well as Socialist Workers Party write-in candidate Tom Baumann (who ran unsuccessful campaigns in Minnesota and in the Borough of Manhattan). Rooney received endorsements in Florida from Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, U.S. Reps. Allen West and Dennis A. Ross as well as from the National Rifle Association. In their Saturday, October 13, edition the Tampa Bay Times recommended Tom Rooney for the District 17 seat, and on October 19, The Tampa Tribune endorsed him. The Bradenton Herald recommended Rooney on 26 October. ;2014: ;2016: Tenure One of the first bills Rooney introduced in the House was to prevent any money being spent to bring prisoners to Florida from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Another was a bill he co-sponsored to try to reduce the number of military veteran suicides by mandating mental health screenings for returning troops. Although that bill did not pass, the military eventually adopted the reforms Rooney asked for. Rooney has been recognized by the city of Stuart, Florida for his efforts to prevent veteran suicides. Rooney sponsored a bill to name a federal courthouse under construction in Fort Pierce in honor of a St. Lucie County rancher, and former Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice, Alto Lee Adams Sr.; Rooney's bill was approved by the House in September 2009, but was not passed by the Senate until September 2012, when the new courthouse had been open for eight months. Since 2009, Rooney has personally presented Congressional Award medals to young people in his district. In April 2011, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, traveled to Iraq with Rooney and four other members, who met with Prime Minister Nouri al- Maliki and Ambassador James Franklin Jeffrey. Rooney said that they discussed with Maliki how the United States and Iraq might interact diplomatically after the U.S. troop withdrawal scheduled for December of that year. Stuart, Florida office of Congressman Tom Rooney On the evening of February 19, 2012, a man crashed his pickup truck into Rooney's Stuart, Florida office. No one was inside the building at the time. The man claimed he tried to park in front of the building, but instead of pressing the brake, accidentally pressed the accelerator. The driver was cited for careless driving by the Stuart Police Department. Rooney, as Chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy and Poultry, introduced The Defense of Environment and Property Act in March 2012. This act would make changes to federal water regulations and prevent some prosecutions of farmers and landowners by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. In response to an expansion of federal power to regulate wetlands in a 2011 EPA and Army Corps document that redefined \\"navigable waters,\\" the Rooney bill defines navigable waters to exclude \\"wetlands without a continuous surface connection\\" to a body of water. The Rooney bill is a companion to a Senate bill introduced by Rand Paul. =Libya= A June 2011 bill to defund U.S. operations in Libya was written by Rooney, but defeated on the floor of the House because 89 Republicans voted against it. Rooney accepted responsibility for defeat of the bill, which was in competition with a non-binding resolution to deny President Barack Obama authority to wage war against Libya, saying \\"It was my bill. You can blame me. I think we tried to limit funds so our kids weren't in harm's way but not leave NATO on their own. People either wanted all or they wanted nothing.\\" On 13 September 2012, Rooney said that Obama should be blamed for attacks on U.S. embassies in the Middle East because the violence, and the deaths of four Americans in the U.S. Consulate attack in Benghazi, was foreseeable: \\"We supported the rebels without taking into account their individual values or motives, and without understanding their ability or plan to govern. We helped these individuals topple a dictator, but then stood on the sidelines as radical extremists assumed power. It should come as no surprise that these movements in the region have given way to violent, anti-American actions.\\" =District switch with Allen West= Although most of the voters in Rooney's old 16th District were in the new 18th District, in January 2012 Rooney announced that he would run for the neighboring 17th Congressional District seat, while Allen West declared in the new 18th. Redistricting had made West's old 22nd District, which already had a modest Democratic lean, even more Democratic, and West wanted to run in a friendlier district. As previously mentioned, Rooney's former district had been made somewhat friendlier to Democrats, and he opted to run in a more conservative district that included a large chunk of his old district's western portion. In announcing his decision to run for reelection in Rooney's Congressional district, Allen West said: > I have always believed the state of Florida would be best served by having > both Congressman Tom Rooney and myself in the House of Representatives > working to solve our nation's most pressing problems. I have never wavered > from my vision; to work to create jobs, restrain federal government > spending, reduce America's ever increasing national debt, and provide for a > strong national defense to ensure a safer and more prosperous future for our > children and grandchildren. Congressman Rooney is a statesman and has been > an honorable public servant to the constituents of Florida's 16th > Congressional district. It is my goal to continue the success Congressman > Rooney has had in Florida's 16th Congressional district in the newly > proposed 18th district. =Committee assignments= * Committee on Agriculture ** Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry (Chairman) ** Subcommittee on Nutrition and Horticulture * Committee on Armed Services ** Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces ** Subcommittee on Military Personnel ** Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations * Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence * Republican Study Committee Caucus memberships * Congressional Arts Caucus *United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus *U.S.-Japan Caucus Political positions Rooney had a score of 71% from Heritage Action for America regarding his conservative voting record, which is above the Republican House average. Rooney favored agricultural subsidies, including crop insurance and sugar price supports, so that food production in this country can better compete with other countries that provide government subsidies to their farmers. Rooney explained that \\"I don't want our country to depend on Mexico for our food, and I don't want Florida to lose agriculture jobs that we really need.\\" F-35 alternative engine GE/Rolls-Royce engine for F-35 Rooney fought to remove spending for an alternate engine program (built by GE Aviation and Rolls-Royce plc) for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Pentagon had already taken the position that having a single contractor (Pratt & Whitney) will save money. \\"The Pentagon has said repeatedly that they do not want it and do not need it, and the American taxpayers certainly cannot afford it,\\" Rooney said. Rooney sponsored an amendment to the 2012 House spending bill to end funding for the extra engine of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which passed with support from freshman members of the Tea Party Caucus. In December 2011 GE abandoned self-funding to continue development of its alternate engine, finally ending the project. Rooney said that the decision by GE \\"will finally remove any risk that taxpayers may be saddled with the costs of sustaining an extra engine in the future.\\" Terrorism Rooney criticised Justin Amash in May 2012, accusing the Michigan Republican of wanting to \\"coddle foreign enemy combatants\\" because he proposed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to stop the military from indefinitely detaining suspected terrorists who were caught in the United States. Amash and Congressman Adam Smith said they worried about civil liberties and the constitutionality of allowing indefinite detention of U.S. residents suspected of being terrorists. A Rooney press release said that \\"the Amash amendment sacrifices our national security in order to coddle foreign enemy combatants. Never in our nation's history have we granted enemy combatants who attack our homeland during a time of war the same rights and privileges of American citizens, but that's exactly what the Amash amendment would do.\\" Rooney's press release was criticised in turn by a statement from Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty which accused Rooney of being \\"disgracefully dishonest.\\" Finally, Rooney issued a statement of support for a competing amendment to the NDAA by congressmen Jeff Landry, Louie Gohmert and Scott Rigell: \\"The Landry/Gohmert/Rigell amendment explicitly re-affirms and protects the constitutional rights of American citizens, and states clearly that no citizens' constitutional rights can be denied under the provisions of the defense bill... While it's critical that we protect the rights of American citizens, we should absolutely not exploit legitimate concerns in a misguided effort to extend our rights and privileges to foreign terrorists who attack our homeland.\\" The Amash/Smith amendment was defeated and the Landry/Gohmert/Rigell amendment was adopted, both by large margins. Muslim Brotherhood controversy On June 13, 2012, Rooney was one of five members of Congress (including Michele Bachmann, Trent Franks, Louie Gohmert and Lynn Westmoreland) to send letters to the Inspectors General of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice and the Department of State seeking investigations into what they claimed was the U.S. government's involvement with the Muslim Brotherhood. One of the letters in particular to Ambassador Harold W. Geisel, the Deputy Inspector General of the United States Department of State, used the Department's Deputy Chief of Staff, Huma Abedin, as an example of the undue influence. The letter said that Abedin \\"has three family members‚Äìher late father, her mother and her brother‚Äìconnected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations,\\" referring to a study by the Center for Security Policy. Republican Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Scott Brown, as well as Bachmann's former campaign chief Ed Rollins defended Abedin against these allegations. Speaker of the House John Boehner told reporters: \\"I don't know Huma. But from everything that I do know of her, she has a sterling character, and I think accusations like this being thrown around are pretty dangerous.\\" Congressman Mike Simpson condemned the letter as a revival of McCarthyism, telling the Idaho Statesman: \\"Unfortunately, it's not just Michele. The public says, 'There go those Republicans again.' It's a bad reflection on all Republicans. I can't believe the other four members she got to sign the letter with her. Amazing... That doesn't reflect the House Republican Caucus.\\" An editorial in Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers also brought up the ghost of McCarthyism, explicitly pronouncing disappointment in Rooney. On the other hand, Newt Gingrich argued in favor of investigation into the Muslim Brotherhood, characterizing Rooney and the rest as the \\"National Security Five.\\" Columnist Cal Thomas shrugged off the specter of McCarthyism, and said that the real possibility of infiltration by Islamic extremists deserves to be investigated. Responding to her critics, Bachmann said that \\"The concerns I have and my colleagues have are real,\\" and \\"We cannot elevate political correctness over national security.\\" Rooney expressed similar concerns: \\"As a member of the House Armed Services and Intelligence committees, my top priority is ensuring the security of our nation.\\" And that \\"I regret that Mrs. Abedin has become the media focus of this story, because the intention of the letters was to bring greater attention to the legitimate national security risk.\\" A couple of months later, Rooney admitted that it was an unfortunate mistake to include Mrs. Abedin: \\"What got lost was a legitimate question, for the sake of using Congressman (Anthony) Weiner's wife and Sec. Clinton's assistant's name specifically in a letter.\\" During an October campaign stop in Florida to support Mitt Romney, John McCain acknowledged that Rooney and Bachmann had realized that including Abedin's name in the letter to the State Department was a mistake. McCain then softened his earlier criticism from the Senate floor, saying \\"I'm concerned, and they're concerned and I agree with them, about the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood. I'm not saying all members of the Muslim Brotherhood are extremists, but I am saying there are some extremists that are members of the Muslim Brotherhood. ... There is definitely a threat of radical Muslim extremism, some of whom are Muslim Brotherhood‚Äînot all, by far.\\" Florida water quality A Florida kayaker's paddles scoop up algae on the Santa Fe River, 2012 Nitrogen and phosphorus pollution provide nutrients that can cause algae blooms, which in turn produce toxins harmful to humans and animals across the state of Florida. Approximately 1,900 miles of rivers and streams in the state were impaired for nutrients in 2010, up from approximately 1,000 miles in 2008. Impaired acres of lakes in Florida were 378,000 in 2010, up from 350,000 acres in 2008. =Background= In 2008 the public interest law firm Earthjustice sued the EPA on behalf of five environmental groups, claiming that delays by both state and federal governments in establishing quantitative (rather than qualitative) limits for nutrient pollution of Florida's waters were unacceptable. In August 2009 the Obama administration settled the lawsuit by agreeing to begin the process of imposing enforceable EPA standards for nutrient levels in the public waters of Florida. Numerical nutrient level standards announced in November 2010 provoked the State of Florida to fight back by suing the EPA (enraging Earthjustice and environmentalists). Florida's outgoing (Bill McCollum) and incoming (Pam Bondi) Attorneys General, as well as the outgoing (Charles H. Bronson) and incoming (Adam Putnam) Agriculture Commissioners said that the EPA standards \\"are not based on scientifically sound methodology, and were adopted in an arbitrary and capricious manner just to settle a lawsuit.\\" The EPA said that the regulations would not be implemented for 15 months. One year later, Earthjustice counterattacked by filing suit against the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) claiming that the state agency had failed to protect Floridians and tourists from toxic algae outbreaks. Judge Bram Canter of the Florida Division of Administrative Hearings ruled against the Earthjustice lawsuit in June, 2012. The Obama administration then announced that EPA enforcement would be delayed until 2013, and that the EPA may defer to FDEP regulations. =Rooney challenges EPA= After the EPA said that it would establish numeric nutrient levels for waters in the state of Florida, as part of the 2009 consent decree with Earthjustice, Rooney led the state's congressional delegation by writing a letter asking the EPA to work with the state as it formulated rules for Florida. Rooney explained: > Florida has spent over $19 million and several years collecting the > necessary data, sound science and community input to develop standards that > are realistic and attainable for Florida. As the EPA begins to establish > nutrient levels for Florida waters, it is important for the state to be a > part of the decision process and to use the invaluable information that has > been collected. This bipartisan letter signed by twenty-five members of our > delegation simply asks EPA to work with Florida and utilize its data.\\" Following the January 2010 publication of proposed EPA rules for Florida, Rooney said: \\"There are still too many questions that must be answered regarding the science used by the EPA.\\" Rooney and other members of Florida's Congressional delegation met with EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson in March, concerning the proposed Numeric Nutrient rules. At that meeting the agency agreed to extend the public comment period and to hold three more public meetings in Florida. Rooney also told Jackson that he was concerned, inasmuch as she had failed to meet personally with Florida Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Michael Sole. Rooney said: \\"While there was progress in some areas the EPA proposal will have massive repercussions throughout our state. Therefore, this is something we cannot rush head-first into without knowing all the facts and science.\\" Rooney pointed to studies concluding that the proposed rule would take $2 billion out of Florida's economy, and urged the EPA to do an economic analysis of the rule. He also called for the EPA to allow an independent, scientific review of the rule, which the EPA refused to do. An April, 2010 report by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, in conjunction with professors at the University of Florida Food and Resource Economics Department, and with Soil and Water Engineering Technology, Inc. concluded that compliance with the proposed numeric nutrient rule would subject 13.6 million acres of agriculture to direct costs of from $902 million to $1.605 billion annually, and indirect economic impacts of $1.148 billion per year to the state of Florida. \\"This report confirms what we have all feared. The economic ramifications of this proposed rule would be devastating to our state,\\" Rooney said. In August, Rooney again called for delay of final federal rulemaking, pending the results of a third-party analysis, in a bipartisan letter from Florida's Congressional delegation to Lisa Jackson. In September, a federal judge temporarily stopped the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from imposing federal water quality standards on former croplands in the Everglades, ruling that the Corps had changed its rules about water quality standards on former croplands without proper public notice and hearing. In December, 2010, Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum and Attorney General-elect Pam Bondi decided to file a lawsuit against the EPA regarding its proposed numeric nutrient rule. Rooney endorsed that decision, saying that \\"this lawsuit will put a stop to the EPA's misguided assaults on Florida's families and industries.\\" Senator George LeMieux also endorsed the legal challenge to the EPA rule for Florida. =Cooperation, criticism and compromise= After Lisa Jackson appeared before the House Agriculture Committee in March 2011, Rooney said: \\"In all the hearings I've attended as a member of Congress, I've never been to one like Lisa Jackson's appearance before the House Agriculture Committee. All the members of the committee‚ÄîRepublicans and Democrats‚Äîwere up in arms over the EPA's agenda. I've never seen a witness from the administration get attacked like that from members of the president's own party.\\" Rooney sent a letter thanking Jackson for her promise that the EPA would cooperate with the state of Florida (and their Congressional delegation) to come up with reasonable nutrient levels, and for allowing both scientific review and economic analysis of the new regulations. Rooney's letter also asked the following questions: * When will EPA begin to produce a complete economic analysis of the impact of the proposed regulation, and when does EPA expect that analysis to be complete? * What methodology will EPA use in its economic analysis? * Which third-party organization will EPA task with conducting a thorough review of the proposed rule? * When will that third-party review commence, and when does EPA expect it to conclude? * How will EPA adjust the proposed regulation to accommodate the findings of the third-party review and economic analysis? Rooney and Senator Marco Rubio were criticised in the press for \\"siding with polluters\\" and \\"greedy business interests,\\" leading Rooney and Rubio to co-author an article explaining that \\"half of the Democrats in Florida's House delegation supported our amendment to prevent the EPA from enforcing this new mandate until they complete an independent study of the science and a thorough economic analysis\\" and that Lisa Jackson had recently committed to having the EPA work with Florida's DEP. Although the Rooney amendment was eventually dropped, the EPA agreed to a one-year delay of new water rules and that the National Academy of Sciences would conduct an unbiased review of the EPA cost estimate. Rooney was criticized in an editorial for voting for a House bill sponsored by John Mica that would prohibit tightening water pollutant limits without a state's consent, a bill that the EPA protested would \\"overturn almost 40 years of federal legislation by preventing EPA from protecting public health and water quality.\\" In an October 2011 column, Rooney justified congressional review of EPA regulations, reduction of red tape and interference with new mandates as a means to \\"get the federal government off the backs of farmers.\\" Rooney welcomed amended rules for numeric nutrient standards, approved in December by the Florida Environmental Regulation Commission and submitted to the EPA. After final approval by the EPA, the federal standards would then be withdrawn. The EPA acknowledged that \\"states have the primary role in establishing and implementing water quality standards for their waters.\\" In June 2012, Florida submitted, and the EPA approved, a plan to improve water quality in the Everglades.  Tax reform  Rooney voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The bill includes disaster relief aid for Florida citrus growers who suffered loss due to Hurricane Irma, which Rooney calls a \\"big win.\\" Gun policy Rooney characterizes himself as a \\"champion for Second Amendment rights,\\" saying that the right to bear arms is \\"one of our most sacred rights.\\" As of 2017, Rooney has an \\"A-\\" rating from the NRA, indicating a voting record that is generally pro-gun rights. As a Congressman, Rooney has voted in favor of several pieces of legislation to expand gun rights, including a yes vote on H. R. 38 (the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act), which would enable concealed carry reciprocity among all States if and when it is signed into law. Of the Act, Rooney said, \\"Just as a driver's license would be recognized in another state, a person who is legally permitted to carry a concealed handgun for their or their loved ones' own protection should have that ability anywhere in our nation.\\" In March 2017, Rooney voted in favor of the Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act, which, if signed into law, will allow veterans who are considered \\"mentally incompetent\\" to purchase ammunition and firearms unless declared a danger by a judge. Rooney also voted in favor of H.J.Res.40, which successfully used the Congressional Review Act to block implementation of an Obama-era Amendment to the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 that was aimed at preventing the mentally-infirm from legally purchasing firearms. In 2015, Rooney signed a letter to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives objecting to a proposed ban of a certain rifle cartridge due to its armor-piercing capabilities. In the letter, it states that \\"the idea that Congress intended LEOPA to ban one of the preeminent rifle cartridges in use by Americans for legitimate purposes is preposterous.\\" The attempt to ban the cartridges was abandoned shortly thereafter. Rooney opened up more about his opinions on gun lobbyist groups after his February 2018 announcement that he would not be seeking reelection. Rooney stated that even supporting a bump stock ban after the 2017 Las Vegas shooting was akin to \\"political suicide\\" and that \\"the NRA has an extremely sophisticated ability to either help you or hurt you from being able to continue to call yourself 'Congressman.'\\" Rooney also questioned the role of AR-15 style rifles in society, saying \\"What is the purpose of that gun, especially one with a bump stock on it?\\" Personal life Tom Rooney is a grandson of Pittsburgh Steelers founder Art Rooney Sr.,Rep. Tom Rooney: Are you ready for some smashmouth football? a nephew of Pittsburgh Steelers owner and ambassador to Ireland Dan Rooney, and a first cousin, once removed, of actresses Kate Mara and Rooney Mara. Rooney's younger brother, Brian J. Rooney, has a seat on the Pittsburgh Steelers Board of Directors which was previously held by their father. Brian, a veteran of the Iraq War, is a Deputy Director of Michigan Department of Human Services, and was a candidate in 2010 for Congress in Michigan's 7th congressional district. Tom's older brother, Patrick Rooney, Jr., serves in the Florida House of Representatives in District 83. Tom, Tara and their three sons (Tommy, Sean, Seamus) formerly split their time between Tequesta, Florida and Washington, D.C. Rooney decided to run in the new District 17, and he promised to move into that district, but told The Ledger that he and his wife had not yet decided on which city. Rooney planned to move to Charlotte County, but he said that \\"I'm leaving where I grew up. That's the hardest thing.\\" Charlotte County has the largest percentage of voters in the newly-drawn district, and includes the city of Punta Gorda (where Rooney has his campaign office and one of his Congressional offices) as well as the larger, but unincorporated Port Charlotte as well as other unincorporated communities. The Rooneys ended up selling their Tequesta home and purchasing a home in Okeechobee. Palm Beach Kennel Club Tom's grandfather, Art Rooney, bought the Palm Beach Kennel Club in West Palm Beach in 1969 and his father ran the business as president from 1984 until recently, when his brother, Patrick J. Rooney Jr., became president of the club. Tom Rooney lists ownership of stock in family businesses in his congressional financial disclosure form. Rooney has said that he has neither operational nor ownership responsibilities, and the stock is part of a trust with his children as beneficiaries. In 2010, Rooney stood at 346th place in terms of net worth among the members of the U.S. House. The Palm Beach Kennel Club serves the product of yet another family business, Rooney's Old Irish Ale. The Palm Beach County Commission has approved a referendum for the November 2012 ballot to decide whether slot machines will be allowed at the Palm Beach Kennel Club. Tom's cousin Joe Rooney is a spokesman for, as well as Co-Chair and Treasurer of the coalition supporting the Palm Beach County slot machines referendum. Other Florida counties have put slot machine referendums on the November ballot, but Attorney General Palm Bondi issued an opinion that current state law does not allow slots outside of Miami-Dade and Broward counties. Joe Rooney said Palm Beach County will have several paths to follow if the referendum succeeds, including legislation and legal action. Movies In 2014, Rooney made a cameo appearance as a farmer in Walt Before Mickey starring Thomas Ian Nicholas, Jon Heder, and Armando Gutierrez.

The feast occurs annually on 5 May, and although it is originally a local Christian holiday, both Palestinian Christians and Muslims participate. The feast is held in the Palestinian town of al-Khader, just south of Bethlehem. Origins Palestinian folklore suggests that the feast originated during the Byzantine rule of Palestine. According to the folktale, > \\"the feast came and the young men stood together making their vows. One > said, 'I will give a goat,' another 'I will give a sheep.' Then Jirjis > (Jeries), the son of a widow, desired to offer something. They had but one > cow. Then he said, 'I will sacrifice a cow,' and he went and killed the > cow.\\" At evening time his mother called to him and said, 'Where is the cow?' > He said, 'I gave it to El Khader. (St. George)' His mother said, 'You have > cut our lives. Let me not see your face again.' That night, the young man > had a vision. A white haired man appeared to him and said, 'Fear not, I am > El Khader: thou shalt go to Constantinople and to the king‚Äôs palace. Only > each day thou shalt call a blessing upon me.' ... Religious traditions Christian Previously, the feast attracted Arabs from throughout Palestine to visit the Monastery of Saint George and trade loaves of bread, make sacrifices they vow to fulfill and gather for picnics under the olive trees surrounding the monastery. The same tradition continues today, with many Christian pilgrims coming to baptize their children, due to the abundance of stories about the healing properties of Saint George. Although the priest accepts meat as a gift, the Christian tradition of the monastery itself does not sacrifice the animals. On the morning of 6 May, Palestinian Christians from Beit Jala, Bethlehem, Beit Sahour and other parts of Palestine would march in a procession to the monastery. Islamic left Traditionally, Muslims guard the entrance of the church and welcome pilgrims. Like the Christians, the Muslims too sacrifice sheep during the feast and offerings are stored in a sheep pen in the garden of the monastery. In Islam, two sacrifices are offered: The first is the dhabihah, which requires that one-third of the immolated lamb be set aside for consumption by its owner, while the remaining two-thirds are for Allah and given as charity. The second offering is that of a live animal, bequeathed as a gift to Saint George. Muslim signs dot the courtyard of the monastery and traces of the sacrifices are evident in the form of the lamb hides left on the balustrades to dry.

He was born in Wiesbaden, Germany as the son of a Bengali father and a French mother. From 1977 to 1982 he lived in Athens. He has won several national and international awards, including the German National Film Award in Gold in 1996 for Der Totmacher (Deathmaker). His work has been honored with several retrospectives at festivals and cinematheques. In 2008, the MoMA celebrated his film ' (The Himmler Project) as one of the top 250 most important artistic acquisitions of the Museum since 1980. A member of Akademie der K√ºnste, Berlin (the Academy of the Arts, Berlin), Karmakar is internationally regarded for his honest representation of the less attractive aspects of society by focusing on those perpetrators responsible for these downfalls. Karmakar is currently a Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University (2012‚Äì13). He has been invited as one of the four artists (together with Ai Weiwei, Santu Mofokeng and Dayanita Singh) to represent Germany at the German Pavilion at the Art Venice Biennale in 2013. Career Romuald Karmakar discovered film in Munich in the 1980s with a group of friends who often met at the Werkstattkino, a legendary local underground cinema theater, and at the Filmmuseum Munich, then run by Enno Patalas, who became famous for his work with silent film restoration. At the age of 19, Karmakar directed several short films and his first S-8 feature- length film, Eine Freundschaft in Deutschland] (1985). Depicting the private life of Adolf Hitler during his time in Munich, A Friendship in Germany also stars Karmakar as a young Hitler. In the following years, Karmakar continued to expand his experience with filmmaking. He directed several short and mid- length films, including Coup de Boule (1987), which shows young French soldiers head-butting in locker rooms, Gallodrome (1988), about cockfighting in northern France, Dogs of Velvet and Steel (1989), about owners of pitbulls in the pimp scene of Hamburg, Sam Shaw on John Cassavetes, about the producer of Gloria, by John Cassavetes, and Demontage IX- Unternehmen Stahlglocke, about a performance of the Austrian artist FLATZ, in which he crashes between two metal plates while hanging upside down on a rope. Karmakar then directed a three-hour documentary, Warheads (1993), which explores the lives of a German ex-Legionnaire and a British mercenary. The shooting for Warheads took place in a paramilitary training camp in Mississippi, French Guyana, and in the midst of the civil war in Croatia in 1991. His first feature-length film, Deathmaker (1995), was based on psychiatriatric interrogations with the serial killer Fritz Haarmann conducted by his prison psychiatrist in 1924. Taking place exclusively in a small prison interrogation room, Deathmaker belongs to the Kammerspiel, or chamberplay, genre of German film. Fritz Haarmann was also the inspiration for the role of Peter Lorre in Fritz Lang‚Äôs classic film, M (1931). In 1995, the film won the Best Actor Award at the Venice Film Festival and several National German Film prizes. Distributed by Warner Bros. in Germany, the film was a great success in German box offices. Director Monte Hellman (Two-Lane Blacktop) conducted the American DVD release. In 1998, Karmakar contributed an hour-long special, Frankfurt Millennium, to a special series on the French TV channel, ARTE, for the changing century. Frankfurt Millennium was presented alongside films by Hal Hartley, Don McCellar, Walther Salles, and Tsai Ming-liang. Karmakar then directed ' (2000), a fictional ensemble film starring Margit Carstensen, Michael Degen, Herbert Feuerstein, Elizabeth McGovern, Sky Dumont, Peter R√ºhring, Martin Semmelrogge, J√ºrgen Vogel, and Manfred Zapatka. The film depicts a group of tourists who are trapped at the Manila airport after damage to their aircraft. Despite winning the 2000 Silver Leopard Award at the Locarno International Film Festival in Switzerland, the film was not received well by German critics, who did not appreciate the representation of German citizens abroad. In 2000, he directed Das Himmler-Projekt (The Himmler Project), a three-hour documentary reenacting the secret speech Heinrich Himmler gave to the high-ranking SS generals in Poznan, Poland on October 4, 1943. The film features Manfred Zapatka reading the dark speech aloud, and this served as the aesthetic basis for Karmakar's later film, Hamburger Lektionen (also starring Manfred Zapatka). Das Himmler- Projekt was named one of the top 250 most important post-1980 artistic acquisitions by MoMA in 2008. During the 2000s, Karmakar filmed in the German electronic music scene, a large and influential piece of German youth culture that has not been given great attention by filmmakers. His work in the electronic music scene led to the creation of what would later be referred to as the Club Land Trilogy, consisting of 196 BPM, Between the Devil and the Wide Blue Sea, and Villalobos. The films are distinguished by Karmakar's use of a hand-held camera and shooting in plansequences, or long, uninterrupted takes. Karmakar's use of plansequence was motivated by a drive to show the musician in greater focus with the hope of revealing more about what is behind the song. The three films of the trilogy explore different aspects of the electronic music scene: 196 BPM showcases DJ Hell during the Love Parade of 2002, Between the Devil and the Wide Blue Sea follows nine bands including Fixmer/McCarthy, Alter Ego, , and Tarwater, and Villalobos focuses entirely on the famed DJ Ricardo Villalobos. Villalobos has yet to be released due to conflicts with music licensing. In 2004, Karmakar presented two films at the Berlin International Film Festival: ', a fictional film starring Frank Giering and Anne Ratte-Polle based on a play written by Norwegian writer Jon Fosse, and Land of Extermination, a documentary following research being done for a separate fictional film on the crimes of the Hamburg Police Battalion 101 in the former District of Lublin during German Occupation of Poland in the 1940s. Ordinary Men, a historical book written by Christopher Browning, brought the Battalion to popular attention during the 1990s. After the 2005 London bombings, Karmakar encountered an article written about Imam Mohammed Fazazi of the Al-Quds Mosque in Hamburg, which led to the film ', premiered in Berlin in 2006. Several confirmed terrorists involved in the 9/11 attacks had frequently visited this mosque to hear lectures delivered by Fazazi. These lectures were videotaped and distributed to the members of the mosque, and in Karmakar's film, two of these lectures, delivered originally in January 2000, are read aloud by actor Manfred Zapatka. The film's simple structure focuses the viewer's attention on the spoken content of the speeches. In 2008 and 2009, Karmakar participated in three collaborative works. He contributed to Germany 09, a project intended to capture how filmmakers think about current day Germany, created and produced by Tom Tykwer (Cloud Atlas). Karmakar's contribution was a film about Ramses, the eccentric owner of a declining burlesque bar in West Berlin. Karmakar also contributed to Fruits of Confidence, a project produced and directed by Alexander Kluge, a highly influential figure in postwar German cinema. Fruits of Confidence poses questions regarding who can be trusted in the wake of the financial crisis. Karamakar's contributory short film was titled Ralf Otterpohl, Wasserspezialist, and features interviews with a professor from Hamburg, who is an expert in water treatment. Karmakar also contributed to 24hr Berlin, a 24-hour television program featuring the work 60 film directors on the life of Berlin in one day. His film focused on DJ Ricardo Villalobos, and this material became the basis for the full-length film Villalobos, which was premiered in 2009. That same year, he was elected member of the Academy of Arts in Berlin. At the Venice Film Festival in September 2011, Karmakar presented The Flock of the Lord, a documentary featuring footage from Rome following the death of Pope John Paul II and from the hometown of his successor, Pope Benedict XVI, during his election. Karmakar's work has been shown in several retrospectives, such as Cin√©ma du R√©el (2007), Centre Pompidou (2006), BAFICI in Buenos Aires (2008), Vienna Filmmuseum (2010), the Cin√©math√®que in Vienna, and Jeonju Film Festival in South Korea (2010). In June 2013, Karmakar participated in the Venice Biennale, an esteemed, international contemporary art exhibition held in Venice once every two years. Susanne Gaensheimer, Director of the MMK Museum fur Moderne Kunst Frankfurt am Main selected Karmakar along with Ai Weiwei, Santu Mofokeng, and Dayanita Singh to represent Germany with artistic exhibitions at the German Pavilion. Each artist was selected for the strong German and international influences present in their work. Karmakar has found critical praise for his attention to the harsh realities of modern history. His films bring his audiences to consider the imperfections of society in current times and across the last century, particularly by focusing on the perpetrators of injustice and crime. Karmakar's selection for the Venice Art Biennale is also connected to his unique attention to those responsible for the downfalls of society. Karmakar is currently a Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The Malakand road leads through the village linking the Swat Valley to Mardan and Peshawar. At the time of the British Empire, there was a long bazaar, Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs shopkeepers were living side by side. There was a large Hindu community living peacefully in Jalala. Before 1947, there were two chiefs of Jalala named Sharif Malik (of The Khwaidad Khel Clan) and Akhi Malik(of Utmanzai clan). There goes a famous saying about the honesty and rightfulness of Sharif Malik \\"da Sharif Malik khabara, da kaanrhi karkha\\" which means Sharif Malik stands by his words no matter what.He was one of the very few landlords who had the landlord vote during the British rule.Khwaidad Khel and Utmanzi were and are still the dominant families of Jalala. Both are the subtribes of Yousafzai tribe. These families along with the other 90 families migrated to Jalala from Ghwarha Marghay, Qandahar Afghanistan as early as1611 AD. Jalala village was under the control of the Takht Bahi Police Station. Jalala once faced shortage of drinking water the women brought the water in clay pots from the nearby river. One the particular section of the river was very busy and was popularly called ‚ÄúDa Jalala Gudar‚Äù which means a place by river side from where drinking water can be taken to home etc. in Pushto language. The times for bringing water were early morning and before sunset. For this reason Jalala gained popularity in Pashto poetry. The famous song about Jalala Gudar was played frequently from Peshawar Radio Station.‚ÄùDa Jalala Oba Khwagey Dee‚Äù ...Da kalee peghley‚Äù Tre Mangee Radakaveena, Da Jalala.

Early life White was born in Brisbane to Henry White, a trade broker, and Louisa nee Bailey. He attended school at South Brisbane State School, and was appointed pupil-assistant to the Colonial Botanist of Queensland in 1905, a position previously held by his grandfather on his father's side, Frederick Manson Bailey. White also succeeded his uncle, John Frederick Bailey, in becoming Queensland's Government Botanist in 1917. Personal life White married Henrietta Duncan Clark, a field naturalist and avid hiker, at South Brisbane on 21 October 1921. They married in Baptist tradition. Career As the Government Botanist, White aided farmers and naturalists in identifying noxious weeds and evaluating native species for pastures and fodder. Between 1915 and 1926, he worked on a 42-part series on weeds which appeared in the Queensland Agricultural Journal. His books, An Elementary Textbook of Australian Forest Botany (1922) and Principles of Botany for Queensland Farmers (1938) were used as the textbooks for courses in forestry that he held at University of Queensland. In 1921‚Äì1927, he authored a 41-part series on Queensland trees. Also, he co-wrote a 12-part, illustrated series on eucalyptuses with William D. Francis which appeared in Queensland Naturalist in 1924‚Äì1934. He collected a number of species from Queensland, neighbouring states, New Guinea, and New Caledonia. These helped to build up the Queensland Herbarium, where he insisted on keeping full data on distribution of all catalogued species. His friend and fellow naturalist Estelle Thomson also provided him with specimens for the Queensland Herbarium. White was mainly interested in woody species and was an authority on tropical species. He was a correspondent of Harvard University's Arnold Arboretum, and published a monograph of North Queensland rainforest species in its journal Contributions from the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University. In 1944, he instructed Australian Army forestry companies in New Guinea, and conducted surveys of forests of the British Solomon Islands in 1945. He very much enjoyed bushwalking and camping, leading several excursions of the Queensland Naturalists' Club. He was active in a number of horticultural and geographical societies, including the Royal Society of Queensland. He liked to encourage young researchers to continue their studies, and was affectionately known among them as \\"C.T.\\" for his enthusiasm and sociability. Later life He died, just shy of his 60th birthday, from heart disease at his home in Kangaroo Point. He was cremated. White was survived by his wife and two daughters.  Awards & distinctions  In 1946, White was awarded the Mueller Medal for his important contributions to Australian botanical science. University of Queensland awarded him an honorary M.Sc. in 1948. From 1951, Queensland Naturalists' Club has held an annual C. T. White Memorial Lecture in his honour. In September 1950, a few months after his death, a new riverside park at Kangaroo Point was named after him.

In other words, a ground stop is the halting of departing aircraft destined for one particular airport or for a specific geographic area.http://businesstravel.about.com/od/faqs/g/FAQ-Ground- Stop.htm For example, if a ground stop is called for Newark Liberty International Airport, aircraft departing for Newark from other airports will not depart until such time that the ground stop in Newark is lifted. This allows, in this example, for Newark to deal with the task at hand preparing for arriving aircraft once the ground stop is lifted. Ground stops may occur during an operational event, a thunderstorm, due to the danger of wind shear, hail, or another weather-related hazard. A ground stop does not affect flights en route, but it is often accompanied by orders to divert to other cities. Flights that have not departed their airport of origin will be delayed or cancelled. Airlines are required to manage their aircraft at all airports to minimize the impact to passengers affected by the ground stop. Notable examples On September 11, 2001, the U.S. FAA issued a ground stop order for the entire United States, as a precaution against possible additional incoming terrorist attacks by plane. In addition to grounding international flights which had not yet departed, flights already in the air were either re-called (if less than half-way) or diverted to airports in other countries, mostly Canada. The ground stop was lifted on September 13, when departures from airports within the US also resumed. In January 2014, Nav Canada issued a ground stop for Toronto Pearson due to cold weather. The airport authority said the extreme cold was causing \\"equipment freezing and safety issues for employees.\\"Pearson airport delays: What you need to know, CBC.ca, January 7, 2014; retrieved January 7, 2014.

It is operated by Tar Heel Sports Properties, a property of Learfield IMG College, which manages the multimedia rights for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Network's flagship station is WCHL-AM of Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The network began in the early 1960s when WSOC in Charlotte made the first attempt to create a radio network for Tar Heel men's basketball outside the Triangle. In 1965, WSOC owner Cox Broadcasting sold the network to WCHL's owner, Village Broadcasting, which gradually evolved into VilCom. Learfield bought the network from VilCom in the late 1990s. The Network consists mainly of local radio affiliates within North Carolina, southern Virginia, and northern South Carolina. Some stations with local interest carry only football or basketball programming. For example, WAMW-FM of Washington, Indiana, the hometown of Tyler Zeller, aired men's basketball from 2009 to 2012. The Network's play-by-play announcer for football and men's basketball games was Woody Durham from 1971 until his retirement in 2011. Jones Angell succeeded Durham as \\"the Voice of the Tar Heels\\" for both football and basketball beginning with the 2011 football season. From 1989-2005, current Carolina Panthers play-by-play announcer Mick Mixon served as the color analyst.

The state's most powerful station, WBT in Charlotte, has been an affiliate of the network since 1971, except for 1991 to 1995 and 2006 to 2012. WBT is a 50,000-watt clear-channel station that reaches parts of 22 states at night, bringing the Tar Heels' broadcasts to most of the eastern half of North America. According to longtime WBT station manager Cullie Tarleton, putting the Tar Heels on WBT was largely the idea of longtime coach Dean Smith, who wanted to tell recruits from New England that their parents would be able to listen to the games. From 2006 to 2012, WFNZ served as the network's Charlotte outlet, but its weak nighttime signal forced the Tar Heels to contract first with WRFX (2006-2011) and WNOW-FM (2011-2012) to air basketball games as well as football games that kicked off after 5 pm. The Tar Heels returned to WBT beginning with the 2012 football season.

Origin  This park features the duplex home of Timothy and Michael Riordan, lumber baron brothers who married sisters, Caroline and Elizabeth Metz. The brothers were members of an important Arizona Territorial family who played a role in the development of Flagstaff and northern Arizona and were involved in lumber, railroads, cattle, banking, and politics. Cooperatively the Riordan brothers built their thirteen thousand square foot mansion in 1904 while Arizona was still a territory. The home consisted of two similar six thousand square foot wings for each family, connected by a large common room. Charles Whittlesey was the architect for the Riordan homes. He also was the architect for the El Tovar Hotel at the Grand Canyon. Architectural similarities between the structures can be found in the massive stone arches at porch corners as well as exterior elements that reflect the surrounding landscape like log planks, wood shingles, and native stone.  Park history  On November 15, 1978, after over a year of planning and negotiations, Arizona State Parks received a warranty deed conveying the Riordan homes, much of their contents and of land surrounding the structures for State Park purposes. The public opening of the Park was held on August 4, 1983 and only included the Timothy A. Riordan (east) side of the house. This was the results of cooperative efforts of the family owner, Robert Chambers, who had died in 1980, and the Arizona State Park board members and personnel. On April 27, 2002 the Michael J. Riordan (west) side was opened for self-guided tours. The park was scheduled to close on February 22, 2010, for an undetermined amount of time due to state budget cutting, but its contract with the Arizona State Parks system was renewed for another three years under the condition it is self- funded. The Riordan Action Network Group, a team of local volunteers fund- raises to keep the park open and pay the staff salaries. The park now maintains very few staff and relies on volunteers to maintain the mansion and provide educational tours.

The ancient village stands within Stanmer Park, the former private estate of the Earl of Chichester, which the Brighton Corporation (the predecessor of the present city council) acquired for the benefit of Brighton's citizens after the Second World War. The church and a stately home, Stanmer House, stand outside the village but within the park's boundaries. The church, which was declared redundant in 2008, has been listed at Grade II by English Heritage for its architectural and historical importance. History Stanmer's recorded history goes back to 765, when the village and its lands were given to the South Malling monastery in nearby Lewes by the King of Sussex. The village belonged to the Church for several centuries thereafter, being part of the Episcopal See of Canterbury by the time of the Domesday Book. Ownership transferred from the Archbishop of Canterbury to King Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. A church was built in the Middle Ages; records of it go back to 1232. It stood on open land outside the village. It had no known dedication, little is known about the building, and the only remnants from the era are some yew trees in the churchyard and several memorial tablets and tombstones. The church and its associated land were returned to the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1555, not long after the Dissolution. The Pelham family began a long association with the village and church in the 16th century; they took ownership of the whole estate and its lands in the early 18th century. The Grade I-listed Stanmer House was built for them in 1722, and the family became an earldom in 1801 when Thomas Pelham had the title Earl of Chichester bestowed upon him. The Earls demolished the houses and buildings of the old village and created an \\"estate village\\" north-east of the church. In 1838, the third Earl of Chichester, Henry Thomas Pelham, decided to demolish the old church and build a new one on the same site. The architect was probably Ralph Joanes of Lansdowne Place, Lewes. The building is always referred to simply as \\"Stanmer Church\\". The Brighton Corporation bought the Stanmer Estate in 1947 as part of its policy of land acquisition, and in 1952 the boundary of the Borough of Brighton was extended to incorporate the parish. The Diocese of Chichester declared the church redundant from 29 December 2008, meaning it was no longer open for regular public worship. Stanmer Preservation Society maintains the building and opens it every Sunday. It also opens for specials events such as guest speakers and concerts. In the early 1990s, an episode of Mr Bean was filmed here.http://retrofilminglocations.weebly.com/mr-bean.html Architecture Stanmer Church is in the Early English style. It has a simple cruciform layout, with a chancel, nave, north and south transepts and a tower at the west end topped with a thin shingled spire. An entrance porch is incorporated within the ground floor of the tower. A peal of bells cast in 1791 are housed within the tower. Knapped flintwork was used to build the exterior, although the structural quoins are of stone. The church has a slate roof. Inside, stone walls and carved wooden fittings predominate. Jude Jones, the designated carpenter and estate foreman of the Earls of Chichester and also an active member of the church in the 19th century, designed and constructed all the wooden fixtures. The chancel roof is panelled and has moulded rib vaults and intricately decorated ceiling bosses. The nave roof of four bays also has trefoil-headed panelling. A gallery at the west end houses an organ built in 1839. A plastered stone reredos, also with trefoil-headed panels, dates from the mid-19th century. It is flanked by panels depicting the Ten Commandments, designed by Jones. He was also responsible for the pulpit, altar and lectern. His son, Francis Jude Jones, succeeded him in his roles in the Stanmer Estate and was also a capable carpenter, designing a new set of entrance doors as a memorial to the 7th Earl of Chichester. Five memorial tablets and stones were moved from the old church. The oldest non-Pelham memorial dates from 1626, and commemorates Deborah Goffe, the mother of William Goffe (one of the judges at the trial of King Charles I). Another commemorates Sir John Pelham, his wife and their son, all of whom died in the 16th century. They are shown kneeling below the family coat of arms. Other memorials to the Pelhams are housed in the south transept. Churchyard Graves of several Earls of Chichester in the churchyard The churchyard contains an unusual wellhouse, rebuilt at the same time as the church, with a rare vertically mounted donkey-wheel dating from the 18th century or possibly earlier. Donkey-wheels are a smaller version of the more common horse-gin. The animal walks a circular path around the well, turns a wheel attached to a pump, and thereby draws water from the ground. Before mechanical power was available, horse or donkey power was sometimes used in areas where aquifers lay a long way below the surface; this was the case on the chalky South Downs, and both types of wheel were common in Sussex in the 18th century. By 1968, however, only three donkey-wheels and five horse-gins survived. The wellhouse was damaged by a falling tree in 2007 but was repaired by Stanmer Preservation Society. Several members of the Pelham family are buried in the churchyard, mostly on the south side of the church. The churchyard's sole CWGC registered war grave is to the 8th Earl of Chichester, Captain Scots Guards, who was killed in a road accident in 1944. The church today Stanmer Church was listed at Grade II on 2 November 1954. The wellhouse has a separate listing, also at Grade II; this was granted on the same date. Stanmer Church remains within the joint parish of Stanmer and Falmer. The church at Falmer is dedicated to St Laurence, but it lies across the border in the adjoining local government district of Lewes rather than in the city of Brighton and Hove. The parish covers a mostly rural area, including Stanmer and Falmer villages, the main campuses of the Universities of Sussex and Brighton, and the Falmer‚ÄìWoodingdean road (B2123) to the edge of the Woodingdean estate. It also extends some way on to the southern face of the South Downs. The parish priest had responsibility for the chaplaincies of the two universities. Until its closure, there was a weekly service on Sunday evenings, and prayer sessions twice a month. Although no longer used for religious ceremonies, it is still opened by Stanmer Preservation Society every Sunday.

Knopf, examining the successes and failures of the Founding Fathers. Structured episodically, the book examines six turning points in the early history of the United States: the writing of the Declaration of Independence, George Washington's winter at Valley Forge, James Madison's debate with Patrick Henry over Constitutional ratification, Washington's treaty with Creek leader Alexander McGillivray, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison's founding of the Democratic-Republican Party, and the Louisiana Purchase. Ellis, who had previously won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize for History, wanted to write a book portraying the Founders neither as demigods nor villains, but as flawed men who were improvising in response to immediate crises. The book reached #4 on The New York Times Best Seller list, and received largely positive reviews from critics.  Background  Joseph Ellis in 2007 Joseph Ellis is an American professor of history who held an endowed Ford Foundation Chair at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. His previous works on the Founding Fathers had received several awards, including a 1997 National Book Award for American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson and the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for History for his Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation. American Creation was his sixth book. Ellis states in American Creations foreword that the book was prompted by repeated questions he received on his 2000 book tour for Founding Brothers negatively comparing presidential candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore to the Founders. His difficulty in properly assessing the Founders made him want to write a book that both acknowledged their achievements and punctured the myth that they were \\"demigods\\". He stated in an interview that he wanted to show that \\"these folks didn't completely understand what they were doing... They were improvising on the edge of catastrophe.\\" Ellis did the research for the book personally, rather than working with research assistants. He wrote the manuscript by hand with a rollerball pen.  Content  American Creation consists of a foreword, six chapters, and an afterword. In the prologue, Ellis discusses what he calls the \\"stunning achievement\\" of the Founders in creating a nation that became \\"the accepted global formula for national success\\". He criticizes the \\"wildly extravagant claims and equally hyperbolic counterclaims\\" that deify or vilify the Founders, particularly those of academic historians who treat the Founders as \\"racists, classists, and sexists\\". In contrast, Ellis states his intention to present a balanced portrayal of Founders--acknowledging their successes, such as the creation of a nation-sized, secular republic governed by political parties, as well as their failures to deal with slavery and to reach a just settlement with Native Americans. The book's first chapter, \\"The Year\\", examines the Declaration of Independence as well as the American Revolutionary War. Ellis discusses how, \\"latently and surreptitiously\\", the Declaration held more long-term revolutionary implications than the Founders realized. The second chapter, \\"The Winter\\", discusses General George Washington's achievement in holding the Continental Army together during a hard winter at Valley Forge. The army's poor condition causes a critical shift in strategy that would prove decisive for the Americans, forcing Washington to attempt to control the countryside rather than stage a decisive battle with the British. The third chapter, \\"The Argument\\", details James Madison's efforts to secure a strong federal government at the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Madison fails to win approval for a national government that can veto state laws, and initially considers the convention a failure. Instead the Constitution creates a political system in which sovereignty is shared and \\"blurred\\", providing a framework for ongoing debate. Madison emphasizes this advantage, as well as the weakness of the prior Articles of Confederation government during the Revolutionary War, to defeat Anti-Federalist orator Patrick Henry in a debate over Virginia's ratification of the Constitution. Chapter Four, \\"The Treaty\\", considers Washington's failure as president to reach an equitable settlement with Native Americans, with particular consideration to his treaty with Creek leader Alexander McGillivray. Though Washington declares the issue one of his highest priorities and successfully negotiates a treaty, it proves worthless in the face of the relentless expansion of white settlers into Creek territory, the intransigence of the Georgian legislature, and McGillivray's attempts to ally with Spain. Ellis calls the inability to make a fair peace with Native Americans \\"the greatest failure of the revolutionary generation\\", second only to their failure to end slavery. The fifth chapter, \\"The Conspiracy\\", presents the achievement of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in creating American party politics by forming the Democratic-Republican Party. Even as he works to undermine Washington's administration from within, however, Jefferson disparages party politics and denies that he is capable of acting in a partisan fashion, thus failing to understand his own accomplishment. \\"The Purchase\\", the book's final chapter, explores the story behind the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, discussing President Jefferson's achievement in making the Purchase but also his failure to prohibit slavery in the new territory. Ellis argues that Jefferson thus set the nation on the course that would lead to the Civil War, and that as a result, \\"tragedy trumped triumph in the story of the Purchase\\". In the afterword, Ellis states that \\"perhaps the most creative act of the founding era\\" was \\"an expanding liberal mandate that left room, up ahead, for an Abraham Lincoln and a Martin Luther King to join the list of founders.\\"  Reception  American Creation sold well on release, rising to #4 on The New York Times Best Seller list in November 2007. Publishers Weekly gave the book a starred review, stating, \\"This subtle, brilliant examination of the period between the War of Independence and the Louisiana Purchase puts Pulitzer-winner Ellis (Founding Brothers) among the finest of America's narrative historians.\\" Jon Meacham, reviewing the book for The New York Times, called the book \\"illuminating\\", writing that it goes \\"beyond the familiar critique of the founding to explore a point that remains underappreciated: that America was constructed to foster arguments, not to settle them\\". Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times also praised the book, writing that \\"It is Ellis's achievement that he leaves us with a keen appreciation of the good fortune America had in having the right men in the right places at the right times\\". In the Chicago Tribune, Debby Applegate stated that \\"'American Creation' is one of the most enjoyable and thought-provoking books I've read in years.\\" Cindy Kibbe, writing in the New Hampshire Business Review, said of the book, \\"Filled with powerful, masterfully drawn word-pictures and eye-opening insights, Ellis's 'American Creation' should be a must-read for anyone prior to going to the voting polls ... 'American Creation' lets us know we still have much to learn from, both good and bad, from the founding of our nation\\". In The Boston Globe, H.W. Brands called Ellis \\"the reigning master of the episodic approach to history\\"; he complimented the book's style but disagreed with Ellis' conclusion that blurred sovereignty was one of the Constitution's greatest strengths. Jonathan Yardley of The Washington Post wrote that he felt Ellis' portrait of the Founders was largely accurate, but that in his reading of the slavery issue, he was \\"a trifle guilty of the 'presentism' -- seeing the past through the prism of the present -- that he elsewhere deplores\\". Reviewing for The Christian Science Monitor, Randy Dotinga wrote that the book's close examination of \\"dry and tedious\\" political debates \\"makes for rough sledding at times\\", and criticized Ellis' dismissal of academic historians. However, he concluded that \\"Ellis's sharp writing style and appreciation for irony are saving graces\\".  References   Notes   Citations   Bibliography  *  External links  * Joseph J.

History  The museum was formally recognized by the University in 1978 as the Museum of Natural History. In 1999 the Georgia General Assembly recognized it as the official state museum of natural history, naming it the Georgia Museum of Natural History. The history of the museum goes much farther back, however. The museum's first collections date back to the early 1800s as professors and students alike collected specimens to aid in understanding the natural world around them. UGA's first professor, Josiah Meigs, began a collection between 1801-1810. Overtime, the collections continued to grow and moved across campus multiple times. The museum was also closely associated with the University's library and botanical garden.  Internship Program  The museum also offers an internship program for students to gain experience working with the museum collections in the fall, spring, and summer semesters. Interns work with collections staff collecting, accessioning, preparing, cataloging, and curating natural history collections. Collections available for internships are: Archaeology, Arthropods, Botany, Economic Geology, Herpetology, Genomics and Marine Invertebrates, Ichthyology, Invertebrates, Mammalogy, Mycology, Ornithology, and Zooarchaeology. Interns may also participate in tours, outreach presentations, special events, preparation of displays, and field trips.

The SPVA provided personnel, pensions, welfare and support services to members of the UK Armed Forces and veterans and their dependents. It was formed on 2 April 2007 by merging the former Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency (AFPAA) with the Veterans Agency. The agency merged in turn with Defence Business Services on 1 April 2014. History The formation of the SPVA led to the provision of a fully integrated set of ‚Äòthrough life‚Äô personnel services to the serving and veterans community - where a single contact with the Agency granted access to customer information and advice on pay, pensions, compensation payments, records of service and medal entitlement. The responsibility for all pension provision, whether a War Pension or an Armed Forces pension fell under the direct control of the SPVA, reducing the risk of omitting or duplicating information. The SPVA operated from four main sites: Glasgow (Kentigern House), Gloucester (Imjin Barracks), Gosport (Centurion Building) and Norcross (Blackpool). The SPVA's executive agency status was removed on 16 June 2011 in preparation for it to be merged into the Defence Business Services (DBS) organisation. On 1 April 2014, the SPVA merged with Defence Business Services as part of the Defence Reform. The merger is a direct result of Lord Levene‚Äôs Defence Reform report published in 2011, the report recommended ‚Äòthe establishment of a single delivery organisation ‚Äì Defence Business Services (DBS) ‚Äì to deliver transactional and other services in the fields of civilian HR, finance, some elements of information and commercial services, and, at a later date in the transition, security vetting and military HR.‚Äô DBS is now one of three ‚ÄòShared Services Centres‚Äô across government and one of the largest in Europe. The merger between the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency and DBS will not affect services to veterans. SPVA services for veterans ‚Äì Armed Forces pensions, compensation schemes, helplines and welfare support ‚Äì will continue under the ‚ÄòVeterans UK‚Äô name. However, the SPVA logo will now be phased out and replaced with the Ministry of Defence Logo. Phone contacts for veterans services remain unchanged; the Veterans UK Helpline number is 0808 1914 2 18 and the JPAC number is 0800 085 3600.https://web.archive.org/web/20140407083916/http://www.veterans- uk.info/merger_announcement_april.html Functions JPA The Joint Personnel Administration (JPA) system rolled out to the RAF on 20 March 2006, the RN in Oct 2006 and the Army in March 2007. JPA involves new, modern personnel administrative processes, based on harmonised policy and regulations. It has been delivered using a commercial software package and is accessible to all service personnel via Defence Information Infrastructure (DII). Individuals have access and responsibility for the upkeep of their own information and can make expenses and allowance claims on-line, via the self-service facility. Continued improvement and development of JPA functionality is an ongoing commitment. There have been (as of 2011) 14 major JPA releases and Monthly releases delivering improved system functionality and security. AFCS The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) is a package for serving and former members of the Armed Forces. It is designed to provide compensation, irrespective of fault, across the full range of circumstances in which illness, injury or death may arise as a result of service. AFCS replaced the previous arrangements under the War Pensions Scheme and the attributable elements of AFPS 1975. The scheme covers all Regular and Reserve personnel whose injury, ill health or death is predominantly caused by service on or after 6 April 2005. Tax free lump sum awards, up to ¬£570,000, for injury can be paid in Service, with an additional monthly Guaranteed Income monthly payment, available for the most seriously injured, on leaving the Armed Forces. Pensions The agency is responsible for the assessment, award, payment and maintenance of all pensions relating to service in the Armed Forces. This includes the Armed Forces Pension Schemes, Reserve Forces Pension Scheme and, for those disabled or bereaved through service, war disablement pensions, related allowances and other payments to veterans. The agency provides payments to around 584,000 ex-service personnel or dependants each month. JCCC The Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre (JCCC) provides a 24/7 service to members of the Armed Forces. Handling over 90,000 telephone calls a year, it co-ordinates all work relating to current military fatalities, injuries and compassionate cases, including family liaison and repatriation. JCCC also co- ordinates investigations following the discovery of human remains of personnel, primarily from the First and Second World Wars. Medals The MOD Medal Office is responsible for the assessment, engraving and awarding of circa 44,000 current campaign and historic medals a year to past and present members of the Armed Forces. Medals relating to service dating back as far as World War II can still be claimed. Around 200 such applications per week are received from veterans and their families. Veterans badges In addition, the agency continues to administer the distribution of the extremely popular HM Armed Forces Veterans Badge, with over 811,000 issued as at October 2010. To be eligible to receive a UK Armed Forces Veterans badge you must have been a member of either the Army, Royal Navy, Royal Marines, Royal Air Force (RAF), Volunteer or Regular Reserves. Veterans support The SPVA‚Äôs Veterans Services Directorate provides support to anyone who has served in HM Armed Forces, even just for a day. This includes a free Veterans-UK helpline and website, providing advice on benefits, compensation payments, pensions, employment and much more. For those with more specific needs, the Veterans Welfare Service (VWS) provides one-to-one advice and support especially in respect of the statutory schemes (WPS and AFCS), in the home if needed. VWS have five regional hubs known as Veterans Welfare Centres from 25 offices across the UK. Each centre acts as a first point of contact for welfare delivery, providing professional help, advice and guidance over the phone. From there, a Welfare Manager, local to the client, may be contacted if further assistance with resolving the clients issue is needed. SPVA also administers and manages the Ilford Park Polish Home (IPPH) near Newton Abbot, Devon. The home provides residential and nursing care for former members of the Polish forces who served under British command during WWII in accordance with the Polish Resettlement Act 1947. Despite the increasing age of residents, considerable demand for places at IPPH continues. The home accommodates 98 residents, with an average age of 84.

It overlaps between the four sub- districts of two districts, Bang Yi Ruea and Hiran Ruchi of Thon Buri with Somdet Chao Phraya and Khlong San of Khlong San in the centre of Bangkok, at the intersection of Prajadhipok/ Intharaphithak/ Lat Ya/ Somdet Phra Chao Taksin Roads. Nearby is Wongwian Yai Station, a historical commuter railway terminal to Maha Chai (local name of Samut Sakon provincial city) and Mae Khlong (Samut Songkhram), a southwestern suburb of Bangkok. History The circle was built following the Memorial Bridge (Phra Phutta Yodfa Bridge) opening on 6 April 1932, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Chakri Dynasty and Bangkok City (Rattanakosin Kingdom). The bridge from old Bangkok conducted 11 new road projects to be built on Thonburi side of the Chao Phraya River, also with the circle. It was named Wongwian Yai, \\"big circle\\" in Thai, as there was a smaller traffic circle with clock tower next to the Memorial Bridge called Wongwian Lek, \\"small circle\\". The statue of King Taksin was built 21 years later. View of Wongwian Yai from Intharaphithak Road (left is Hiran Ruchi, right is Bang Yi Ruea) Statue of King Taksin As a memorial to Taksin the Great, one of the great Thai kings who liberated the country after Ayutthaya was taken by the Burmese in 1767, the statue was built here in 1953, on the Thonburi side of the river where the king had established a new capital in 1768. The statue was created by the Italian sculptor Corrado Feroci, who worked under the Thai name Silpa Bhirasi. A state ceremony on a day of homage to the king, 28 December, has been held annually since 1954. Wongwian Yai area The monument of King Taksin the Great at Wongwian Ya The circle is one of Bangkok's major traffic intersections, linking residential areas on the Thonburi side to Bangkok's downtown via the Memorial Bridge in the north. The northeastern road, Lat Ya, links Khlong San Pier with ferry service to Si Phraya Road or the further Taksin Bridge to Sathon and Si Lom business clusters. The southern road, Somdet Phrachao Taksin (or Taksin Road), links to suburban areas on Suk Sawat and Rama II Road and reaches Chulachomklao Fort at the river's mouth in Samut Prakan Province. The western road, Inthara Phitak, is important as it links to the beginning of Phet Kasem Road, the highway to west and south Thailand. At the southwest corner of the circle, there is a commuter railway station to Samut Sakhon Province. Because of its traffic, the area used to be the major business area of Thonburi, before urbanization reached outer areas of Bangkok. There are many markets, retail shops, department stores, cinemas, and other businesses. The area is also known for its large cluster of Thai leather traders on Charoen Rat Road opposite the railway station.

He re-appointed Charles \\"Wappy\\" Wappenstein, previously dismissed for corruption, as chief of police. Their administration was dramatically corrupt, to the point of being a national news story.

After completing his secondary education in Coll√®ge Champittet, Switzerland, he studied law at the University of Aix-en-Provence. Career Counsel to the bar of Marseille between 1920 and 1924, he abandoned his legal career to turn to literature. Brion wrote nearly a hundred books in his career, ranging from historical biography to examinations of Italian and German art, and turning later in life to novels. His most famous collection of stories is the 1942 Les Escales de la Haute Nuit (\\"The Shore Leaves of the Deepest Night\\"). An essay of Brion appears in Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress, the important 1929 critical appreciation of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. He was a friend of the philosopher Xavier Tilliette. In 1964, Brion was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise's chair 33, replacing his friend Jean-Louis Vaudoyer.

It replaced in 1 April 2008 just after it went bankrupt. History Asahi Sonorama was created as a division of Asahi Shimbunsha on September 9, 1959 under the name \\"Asahi Sonopress\\". It was initially established to record interviews, news, crime scene investigations, and articles on a variety of topics, and then release them on tape and sonosheets in the audio recording magazine Asahi Sonorama (from whence the company got its name). While doing this, the company also began publishing other magazines, manga collections, and novels. Even though the sound quality of sonosheets was lower than that of vinyl records, the sonosheets were flexible and could last a long time. Asahi Sonorama found a market among those who could not afford the high price of LP records and was therefore able to enter the record market and compete with record companies and publishers. After a time, however, the magazine and the sonosheet started having different content, and sale started dropping, so the magazine began changing its area of specialty toward having more child-oriented music and content. As anime, manga, tokusatsu, TV dramas, and the like became more popular, the magazine became more of a digest or anthology of stories, theme songs, and pictures from these series. Because of this, people began purchasing the magazine as a gift for children and sales began to be brisk again. However, the various record companies and publishers began taking advantage of this popularity by publishing their own magazines and sonosheets. In the 1960s, due to the huge rise in the number of television shows targeting children, there was also a huge rise in the amount of material to choose from for inclusion in Asahi Sonorama. Since all of them were drawing from the same sources, the Asahi Sonorama and its rivals would often release sonosheets and vinyl records at the same time. Asahi Sonorama (the company) began to move into the vinyl record market at this time. In 1966, the company's name was changed from \\"Asahi Sonopress\\" to \\"Asahi Sonorama\\". Due to the flooding of the market with similar goods, many companies began going under in the 1970s because they couldn't maintain their production levels and still make a profit. Asahi Sonorama was able to improve their manufacturing technique for the sonosheets to the point where they could attach paper labels to them, calling them \\"punch sheets\\" instead of \\"sonosheets\\". They also improved the sound quality, allowing them to release anime and tokusatsu picture books with the included punch sheet in stereo instead of mono sound. In 1975, Asahi Sonorama established its \\"Sonorama Bunko\\" imprint, and in September that same year began publication of the magazine Manga Sh≈çnen. Unfortunately, the market for picture books with included records disappeared quickly in the 1980s, so they refocused their attention on the regular publishing business. Between June 21, 2007 and September 30 of the same year, Asahi Sonorama went through bankruptcy liquidation proceedings. The trademarks for \\"Sonosheet\\" and \\"Asahi Sonorama\\" were passed to their parent company, Asahi Shimbunsha (publisher of the Asahi Shimbun), and publication rights were handled by the publication division of that company. On April 1, 2008, Asahi Shimbunsha spun off its publication division into a subsidiary company, Asahi Shimbun Publications, and Asahi Sonorama is now considered a division of that company.

The goals are often to create new awareness of social issues, and to stimulate community involvement. Such practices have a history that includes certain street artists of the 1960s, such as The Diggers of San Francisco, or the Provos of Amsterdam, among many others. Contemporary artists often associated with urban interventionist practices are Daniel Buren, Gordon Matta-Clark, Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Krzysztof Wodiczko,Theatre, Theory, Postmodernism, by Johannes H. Birringer, Indiana University Press, 1991. p 38. Thomas Hirschhorn, Francis Al√øs, Harrell Fletcher, the Red Peristyle group, Banksy and many others.  Social and spatial  Urban Interventionism has been associated with a changed understanding of the relationship between the social and the spatial, called the \\"spatial turn\\" of the arts and sciences in the 1980s.Soja, E. Postmodern geographies: the reassertion of space in critical social theory. Verso, London and New York. 1989 In this turn a new viewpoint was taken on public and urban spaces \\"...whereby urban spaces are seen not merely as containers for or outcomes of social processes, but as a medium through which they unfold and as having constitutive significance .\\" According to this train of thought the spatial sights of a city have the power to shape interactions and create new experiences. This power is utilized by urban interventions through the works created by the artists.  Ideology  Urban interventionism often target local communities as their targets. There are different strands of activity within urban interventionism. While mostly activistic, many artists have different focus points. George Y√∫dice, Professor of American Studies Program and of Spanish and Portuguese at New York University, defines the term as referring to \\"public or participatory art through which publics constitute themselves and experience something extraordinary in the process.The Heuristics of Contemporary Urban Art Interventions Dimension, from introduction to \\"Urban Interventions: A Symposium on Art and the City,\\" York University, 2005. The famous street artist Banksy, for example, has done a few famous urban interventions. Some of these are political statements, like his stencil of a girl using balloons filled with helium to float over the wall between Palestine and Israel. Professor David Pinder of the University of London stated that urban interventions are often specifically directed towards the urban space that it is situated in: \\"(urban interventions)...are typically concerned less with representing political issues than with intervening in urban spaces so as to question, refunction and contest prevailing norms and ideologies, and to create new meanings, experiences, understandings, relationships and situations.\\"Pinder, David. Urban Interventions: Art, Politics and Pedagogy. International Journal of Urban and Regional Research. Volume 32.3, September 2008. An example of a more situational urban intervention is the RedBall project by Kurt Perschke. The project consists of a large inflatable red ball that has been set up at many different sites worldwide, providing a new engaging space for people to interact with.  Disciplines  Much of the work is multidisciplinary and intermedial, combining art forms or creating works that are hard to classify. Artists working in this international vein often utilize outdoor video projection, found objects, sculptural artifacts, posters, and performance events that might include and involve passersby on the street. Urban interventions are not first objects to pursue the creation of meaning in urban space through the combination of art forms, and they have been linked to artists and philosophers of the 1960s. In 1968 philosopher and sociologist Henri Lefebvre wrote the Le Droit √† la ville (Right to the City), in which he states that: : \\"To put art at the service of the urban does not mean to prettify urban space with works of art. This parody of the possible is a caricature. Rather, this means that time-spaces become works of art and that former art reconsiders itself as source and model of appropriation of space and time.\\"Lefebvre, H. Right to the city. In H. Lefebvre, Writings on cities, E. Kofman and E. Lebas (trans. and eds.), Blackwell, Oxford [originally published in French]. 1996 (1968) This also echoes other art forms that are connected to urban interventionalism like the 1960s Happenings and Richard Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk. These also saw urban space as a medium, bringing art into peoples' daily lives.

Originally divided equally between the two types, the fleet currently consists of 23 DE30AC locomotives (diesel power only) and 20 DM30AC locomotives (diesel or third rail power). Details  The DE30AC and DM30AC locomotives replaced aging GP38s, Alco FA1/FA2s, F7As and F9As, and MP15AC and SW1001 locomotives, with GP38s used to push and pull diesel trains and other locomotives used to provide Head End Power for the trains. The bodies of the DE30AC and the DM30AC are extremely similar; the difference is the ability of the DM30AC to use electric third rail while the diesel engine is off, enabling the locomotive to use the East River Tunnels into New York Penn Station. This permits direct service from non-electrified lines in eastern Long Island via the western electrified main lines all the way to Penn Station. A few such trains a day run on the Port Jefferson, Montauk, Oyster Bay, and Greenport branches, usually during peak times. Single engines run with six cars or fewer and engines are placed on the East (Montauk) end of the train. Generally, two engines are used when there are seven or more cars. Of the original 46 locomotives, 44 are still in use. The locomotives retired include: * DM30AC 503, which was damaged in an accident at Huntington on October 23, 2000. It hit a shopping cart on the tracks, which shorted out the third rail and caused the locomotive to catch fire. It sat in the LIRR's Morris Park Facility and had been stripped for spare parts to maintain the remainder of the fleet until July 2018, when it was scrapped. * DM30AC 507, which suffered an electrical cabinet failure. Unlike 503, it was salvaged by being converted into a DE30AC locomotive, renumbered to 423, and returned to service. * DM30AC 511, which was damaged in a minor accident on May 25, 2019. It hit a 14-unit long train stopped at a siding rated for 13 units of train length, which caused the locomotive to lose a third rail shoe and sustain frame damage. It is now sitting in the Morris Park Facility, most likely to be used for parts before being scrapped.(LIST), LI Sunrise Trail. ‚ÄúLong Island Railroad Wrecks.‚Äù Long Island Railroad Wrecks, 2006, www.trainsarefun.com/lirr/lirrwrecks/lirrwrecks.htm.

It was designed by Robert Lawson in the 13th century Gothic style and construction began in 1872. It is the second building for the congregation. The first, completed in 1860, was the second Presbyterian church in the settlement. It was a large wooden structure sited in Great King Street, close to the University of Otago Faculty of Dentistry building.Croot, p.99 Though this was only ever intended to be a short-term home for the Knox congregation the onset of the Central Otago Gold Rush intensified the need for a larger, permanent structure. Church officials held a competition which was won by Lawson. His plans, however, would have exceeded the church's ¬£5,000 budget and the deacons fell back on a design by David Ross. Because he insisted on employing an inspector of works who \\"could be bought at any time with a pot of beer\\", Ross's contract was annulled within two months.

It stars Gabrielle Drake, Astrid Frank, Me Me Lai and Nancie Wait. Part of the British 1970s softcore sex comedy genre, the film also includes appearances by mainstream actors Richard O'Sullivan, John Le Mesurier, Ferdy Mayne, Geoffrey Bayldon and Johnny Briggs. A sequel, Glamour Incorporated, was also to have been directed by Guest but was never produced. Plot Four young female au pairs are seen arriving at Heathrow Airport. They are then taken to the offices of the Overseas Employment Agency in London, which has arranged placements for them. Anita Sector is assigned to Mr and Mrs Anderson. She does not prove popular with Mr Anderson as she manages to flood the house while taking a shower and then disappears on a date with Malcolm, a man who preyed on her at the airport. They visit a casino where Anita meets Sheik El Abab and disappears with him after Malcolm loses money at the roulette table. When she is taken to the sheik's home, she spends time with his concubines and discovers that he is a very wealthy philanthropist. When the sheik tries to seduce Anita, she realises that her deadline for returning to the Andersons' house has passed. She reaches the house to find her suitcases on the doorstep. Randi Lindstrom is assigned to the family of businessman Mr Wainwright. She is picked up by his son Stephen, who is immediately attracted to her. After a series of mishaps, Stephen and Randi end up back at Mr Wainwright's offices and have sex in the car, where they are found naked by a shocked Mr Wainwright the next morning. Nan Lee is assigned to Lord and Lady Tryke as a playmate for their son Rupert, who is being groomed as a concert pianist. Rupert's exposure to the outside world has been limited to trips out in the car and he is immature for his age due to a lack of appropriate interaction with other young people. Nan plays along with Rupert's children's games in the garden and after dinner. Later, she reflects on Rupert's immaturity but realises that she has enjoyed her time with him. She seduces him and quietly leaves the next morning. Christina Geisler is assigned to the Fairfax family. Learning that Christina is a virgin, their daughter Carol decides to take her along to see pop star Ricky Strange. Carol and Christina go shopping to buy a more revealing outfit that will help Christina to arouse Ricky. Christina meets Ricky after his performance and ends up having sex with him, quickly followed by Carol's boyfriend Buster, but this is all revealed to have been a ruse by Carol to enable her to have sex with Ricky. After Christina realises that she has been used, she confides in Buster, who is understanding despite his boorish personality. Next morning, she tells Carol that she is leaving and terminates her employment with the Fairfaxes. Randi, Nan and Christina end up back at the agency. Anita arrives and asks them if they want to join her as new concubines for the sheik. They immediately accept, and all four au pairs get into the sheik's car and are driven away.

Unfamiliar with the genre, he decided to view a number of foreign sex comedies in preparation, turning to ex-BBFC censor John Trevelyan for suggestions. The original script was adapted from a story by pornographic film producer David Grant. Guest disliked its explicit sexual content and made numerous revisions before agreeing to film it. Principal photography began in January 1972. Shooting locations were based in and around London. The opening scenes were filmed at Heathrow Airport, with Mr Wainwright's office represented by Euston Tower and the Tryke family home by Oakley Court in Bray, Berkshire. Most of the scenes featuring Nan Lee (Me Me Lay) were filmed at Friar Park, George Harrison's mansion in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. Release and reception The film was released in September 1972. In a contemporary review, Derek Elley of The Monthly Film Bulletin was critical of the film: \\"Val Guest hits rock bottom with this humourless attempt at a sex comedy ... Gabrielle Drake and Astrid Frank just manage to keep the film moving, but as the national jokes pile relentlessly on top of one another, the principal diversion becomes the spotting of familiar British faces in the unlikeliest of roles.\\" Commentator Simon Sheridan describes the film as a \\"funky, swinging feast of fun\\". He adds that while many sex comedies of the 1960s and 70s stereotyped female au pairs as \\"sexually provocative sexpots\\", Au Pair Girls was the first British film to cast them as the main characters. Brian Davidson of Cinema Retro magazine writes that the film's \\"chauvinistic treatment of women\\" would make it objectionable to many modern audiences. He also argues that while the film is ostensibly a comedy, \\"at least half of its running time has little to do with humour. While on the one hand it is a celebration of the liberal sexual attitudes of the time ... on the other, it ultimately condemns those same attitudes.\\" He considers the film unusual for the genre in its portrayal of Christa (Nancie Wait), whose unhappy story \\"forces us to reconsider our response to everything that has gone before.\\" Guest rejected claims that the film is pornographic, instead calling it \\"art\\". In an interview with Cinema X magazine, he described the film's depiction of sex as \\"all fun; it's bubble. There is absolutely no violence or kinks. There are no lesbians, no queers and no whips; nothing like that at all.\\" In his autobiography, he distanced himself from Au Pair Girls and his later sex comedy Confessions of a Window Cleaner, stating that he preferred to be remembered for his earlier work.

Roxburgh graduated from Ontario Agricultural College and became a turkey breeder and orchardist. In the 1930s, he ventured into local politics and business in the Simcoe, Ontario area. He organized the Ontario Juvenile Hockey Association in 1934, and was a cofounder of the Ontario Minor Hockey Association (OMHA) in 1940. He served as president of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) from 1950 to 1952, and was credited with improving the OHA's finances and profits. He served as president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) from 1960 to 1962. He arranged exhibition games between Canada and the Soviet Union, represented the CAHA at the International Ice Hockey Federation, and pushed for the separation of politics and sport when the Cold War threatened the 1962 Ice Hockey World Championships. He was opposed to changes in the International Olympic Committee's definition of amateurism, and recommended the formation of an amateur student team coached by Father David Bauer to become the Canada men's national ice hockey team. His hockey career was recognized as a life member of the OMHA and the OHA, and the CAHA Order of Merit. Roxburgh served as a Liberal Party of Canada member of the House of Commons of Canada for the riding of Norfolk from 1962 to 1968. He was elected three times, defended the Canadian tobacco industry in his home riding, pushed for university students registering as voters, and introduced legislation to declare ice hockey as the national game of Canada. Early life John Maxwell Roxburgh was born on February 14, 1901, in Phoenix, Arizona. His family was temporarily living in Arizona, until his parents relocated the family to Cache Bay, Ontario while Roxburgh was a youth. He attended secondary school in Sturgeon Falls, Ontario. He graduated from Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph in 1926, with a degree in horticulture, and played on ice hockey and rugby teams in college. Roxburgh worked at a cannery in Wellington County, Ontario, for a year, then relocated to Norfolk County, Ontario, in 1928. He worked for a year at the Government of Ontario turkey farm, near Turkey Point, Ontario. In 1929, he purchased a farm in Woodhouse Township, and began breeding a flock of 1700 turkeys which won prizes at the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair and the 1933 Chicago World's Fair. During the 1930s, he served as president of the Ontario Turkey Breeders Association for three years, operated a life insurance business, and served as a Woodhouse Township Council member and deputy reeve. By 1941, he began cultivating orchards of cherries, apples, peaches and strawberries, and served as secretary of the Norfolk Federation of Agriculture. Ontario hockey career Simcoe, Ontario (Norfolk County offices pictured), hometown of Roxburgh Roxburgh assisted in organizing a Sunday school league in 1934, in Simcoe, Ontario.Norfolk Historical Society (1985) p. 169 Later that year, Roxburgh and Roger Matchett organized the Ontario Juvenile Hockey Association (OJHA) in southwestern Ontario, and Roxburgh volunteered to manage and coach of the Simcoe juveniles team.Ontario Minor Hockey Association (2010). p. 7 He served as secretary-treasurer of the OJHA from 1934 to 1936,Ontario Minor Hockey Association (2017‚Äì2018). p. 14 and then as its president from 1936 to 1938.Ontario Minor Hockey Association (2017‚Äì2018). p. 13 His team evolved into the Tiger Cub Juveniles, then was later known as Roxy's Reformer Cubs. The team's players were chosen from the Sunday school league, and reached the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) junior ice hockey semifinals during the 1937‚Äì38 season. Roxburgh's OJHA operated with four teams, and he sought to increase the numbers of teams and competition level. He arranged games with the Ontario Midget and Bantam Hockey Association based in St. Catharines, Ontario. Roxburgh was involved in negotiations for the two organizations to merge, founding the Ontario Minor Hockey Association (OMHA) on November 30, 1940.Ontario Minor Hockey Association (2010). p. 8 The new league began its first season with eight teams,Ontario Minor Hockey Association (2017‚Äì2018). p. 15 and Roxburgh convinced the new OMHA to sign an affiliation agreement with the OHA in 1940.Young, Scott (1989), p. 290 Roxburgh later became a convenor and an executive within the OHA, then served as OHA president from 1950 to 1952.Young, Scott (1989), p. 348 Historian and writer Scott Young credited Roxburgh for being an astute businessman and improving the OHA's finances by increasing profits from the playoffs in junior ice hockey.Young, Scott (1989), p. 217 In 1951, Roxburgh appointed Bill Hanley to become the full-time manager of the OHA to assist in running the association as a business.Young, Scott (1989), p. 205 In 1951, the OHA was faced with a mutiny in the senior ice hockey ranks in Kingston, Ontario. After an inquiry, Roxburgh and fellow OHA executives George Dudley, Frank Buckland and W. A. Hewitt, handed out a lifetime suspension to George Patterson who coached Kingston's senior B-level team, for conspiring to deliberately lose a playoff series to avoid moving into a higher-level of playoffs, rather than staying in a lower level and potentially make more profits at home playoff games than on the road.Young, Scott (1989), pp. 207‚Äì209 Roxburgh was succeeded as OHA president by S. E. McTavish, and later represented the OHA at the national level as its past president. CAHA vice-president Roxburgh was elected second vice-president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) on May 30, 1957, and served in the role for two years until 1959.Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (1990). pp. 129‚Äì130 He chaired the minor ice hockey committee which organized Minor Hockey Week in Canada in 1958 and 1959, and oversaw scheduling at the 1959 Memorial Cup. He was elected first vice-president of the CAHA in 1959. He remained chairman of the minor hockey committee, and reported at the 1959 annual general meeting that minor hockey registrations had increased by 2700 players from the previous season. He remained in charge of scheduling for the 1960 Memorial Cup playoffs, and directed the referees to be tougher on physical play and stick-swinging in the 1960 finals, due to aggressive and dangerous play. CAHA president First term Roxburgh oversaw scheduling and officiating for Memorial Cup playoffs (trophy pictured), and wanted to see more balance between teams in competing in Eastern and Western Canada. Roxburgh was elected CAHA president on May 28, 1960, at the annual general meeting in Sydney, Nova Scotia, and succeeded Gordon Juckes, who had stepped down as president to be appointed a full-time secretary and employee of the CAHA. Roxburgh was subsequently elected a director of the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States (AHAUS) later in 1960. As CAHA president, Roxburgh arranged exhibition games between Canada and the Soviet Union, and represented the CAHA at the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).Pond, George (2019) p. 51 Roxburgh and fellow CAHA executives were tasked with choosing which club would represent the Canada men's national ice hockey team at the Ice Hockey World Championships and in ice hockey at the Olympic Games. The CAHA felt that the Winnipeg Maroons were Canada's strongest team to win the 1961 Ice Hockey World Championships, but the Maroons could not play a three-week exhibition tour in Switzerland due to work commitments. Roxburgh later announced the Trail Smoke Eaters were chosen to represent Canada, and would participate in a profitable exhibition tour. He also admitted that Soviet teams were faster and stronger than before, and that Canada needed to improve to win against them in the World Championships. Roxburgh travelled with Trail on the exhibition tour of Europe, and felt they were a balanced team that could play physical hockey. After games with in Sweden, Herman Carlsson of the Swedish Ice Hockey Association said that Canadian players were intent on injuring Sweden's best players in advance of the 1961 World Championships. Roxburgh responded by calling the Swedish players weak, and offered to arrange to a trip to Canada where Sweden could learn how to play hockey. The tour continued into the Soviet Union, and after Trail lost to HC Dynamo Moscow by a 3‚Äì2 score, Roxburgh said, \\"the Russians have come a long way and are able to give and take body checks just as we do\\". He told reporters in Czechoslovakia that either Canada or the Soviet Union national ice hockey team would win the gold medal at the 1961 World Championship. His prediction proved correct when Canada won the gold medal over the Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team. Roxburgh chose to share profits from the television rights of the exhibition series with members of the Trail Smoke Eaters, after it was mistakenly reported that the team would get a share of the profits instead of just the CAHA retaining the profits. After the tour completed, Roxburgh stated he was opposed to more exhibition games in Sweden in the upcoming winter season due to issues regarding physical play, and didn't want to risk more problems. At the 1961 CAHA annual general meeting in Port Arthur, Ontario, Roxburgh stated that the recent Memorial Cup and Allan Cups were the more financially successful in recent times. Delegates to the meeting pushed for more say about rules of play on the joint committee with the National Hockey League (NHL) and other professional leagues. Roxburgh challenged delegates to choose a consistent refereeing system to be used in national playoffs. Until then, the playoff format had been an executive choice, lacking consistency across the nation. Delegates voted to have one referee and two linesmen at all games, as opposed to two referees without linesmen. Second term Roxburgh was reelected CAHA president on May 26, 1961. In August 1961, the OHA's junior division was reduced to only five teams when the Toronto area teams formed the Metro Junior A League. OHA president Lloyd Pollock applied to the CAHA to permit the Montreal Junior Canadiens from the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association to play in the OHA as its sixth team. Roxburgh denied the request, stating that CAHA rules do not allow en masse transfers between provincial associations. The Canadiens transfer to the OHA's junior division was later approved when the CAHA branch presidents voted in its favour. In September 1961, Earl Dawson of the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association sought approval for the Manitoba Junior Hockey League to use international ice hockey rules, Roxburgh approved of the change and was quoted as saying that \\"certain formalities had to be taken care of\\". Also in September 1961, the Hockey Hall of Fame opened in Toronto. Roxburgh felt that there was no place for two halls of fame in Canada, referring to the Original Hockey Hall of Fame which had yet to be built in Kingston, Ontario, and stated it was a \\"tragedy nothing was done\\" while James T. Sutherland was alive. The CAHA formally withdrew its support of Kingston in January 1962, in favour of Toronto. =1962 Ice Hockey World Championships= In the international game, Roxburgh nominated Vic Lindquist to represent Canada as a referee at the 1962 Ice Hockey World Championships, and that the Galt Terriers were chosen to represent Canada at the World Championships. Roxburgh stated the CAHA had dropped out of the bid to host the 1962 World Championships when AHAUS proposed to subsidize the cost for European teams to travel to Colorado. An exhibition tour was approved for the Trail Smoke Eaters, and Roxburgh accompanied the team to Europe. The CAHA considered sending a team to a junior World Championships in Prague, but later declined to send a team. Construction of the Berlin Wall (pictured) in 1961, led Roxburgh to campaign for East German travel visas to the 1962 Ice Hockey World Championships. The 1962 Ice Hockey World Championships were scheduled to be hosted in Colorado Springs, Colorado, but the event was placed in jeopardy due to the political situation in Europe. When the Berlin Wall was constructed in 1961, NATO responded with travel restrictions which prevented the East Germany national ice hockey team from attending the World Championships. Roxburgh felt that politics should not affect sports, and the decision went against the goodwill and relations established by Canadian teams travelling behind the Iron Curtain. He called for the IIHF to unite in opposition to the NATO decision. Roxburgh was committed to Canada playing in the event, and stated that he would do anything in his power to keep it alive. He sent a cable to Czechoslovak officials urging for their team to participate, and not boycott due to East German travel issues. He appealed to Prime Minister of Canada John Diefenbaker, and Secretary of State for External Affairs of Canada, Howard Charles Green to pressure on NATO on its decision, but both declined to be involved. Teams from the Soviet Union and other communist countries ultimately chose to withdraw in protest of the NATO decision. The CAHA went ahead with the Galt Terriers North American tour, and hoped to benefit from ticket sales at exhibition games. Roxburgh travelled with the team, even though he failed to secure extra funding from Kenneth Farmer and the National Advisory Council on Fitness and Amateur Sport. Canada placed second overall at the World Championships, due to a 5‚Äì3 loss to the Sweden men's national ice hockey team. Roxburgh defended the choice of the Galt as Canada's representative, and stated that the team was just as good as the Trail Smoke Eaters, but was disappointed by the number of penalties Galt took against Sweden. Despite the disappointing result, he announced that exhibition tours for the following season were already being planned. After the Trail Smoke Eaters won the 1962 Allan Cup, the team was approved to represent Canada at the 1963 World Ice Hockey Championships, and Roxburgh requested permission to let the CAHA executive chose a replacement team if necessary. =1962 Memorial Cup= In April 1962, Roxburgh announced the schedule for the 1962 Memorial Cup between the Hamilton Red Wings and the Edmonton Oil Kings, with all games played at Maple Leaf Gardens and broadcast by CFTO-TV. The CAHA was threatened with legal action by K.D. Soble who owned both the Red Wings and CHCH-TV in Hamilton, Ontario, if the CAHA did not share the broadcast profits. The dispute was resolved with games moved to the Hamilton Forum, Guelph and Kitchener, Ontario. CFTO would no longer broadcast the series, and CHCH would cover all games. Roxburgh reaffirmed that the CAHA controlled broadcast rights for its games, and not the individual arenas. As a result of the change, the teams received a share of the television revenue. In May, the CAHA approved a recommendation by Roxburgh to set a up a committee to explore balanced competition in the Memorial Cup playoffs in the wake of regional disparities across Canada. =Canada men's national ice hockey team debate= Roxburgh recommended a proposal by Father David Bauer (pictured) to form a hockey team of amateur student athletes to represent Canada at the 1964 Winter Olympics. At the 1962 annual general meeting of the CAHA, delegates had lengthy discussions on the future of the Canadian national team at the Winter Olympics and World Championships. Roxburgh had previously stated opposition to the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) definition of amateur, and felt that Canada could not abide by the new Olympic code. He felt the new IOC amateur eligibility requirements were \\"a return to the horse and buggy days\\", and stating the \\"rule of amateurism was made years ago when the rich could send their sons and daughters into Olympic competition\\". He motioned not to send a team to the 1964 Winter Olympics on the basis of disagreeing with changes to the Olympic Oath and the definition of amateurism. He explained that since Canada pays its hockey players an allowance to compensate for lost salary it violated the oath, and that by the CAHA turning a blind eye to regulations, it set a bad example for youth. His motion was defeated by a vote of delegates. Another resolution was submitted by the Alberta Amateur Hockey Association to have the Canadian Army train the players. Previously, the CAHA had approved an affiliation with the Canadian Army hockey team as of January 1962. The Thunder Bay Amateur Hockey Association submitted a resolution to have all-star teams from each member of the CAHA play a tournament, with the best team representing Canada. Roxburgh mentioned a proposal from Father David Bauer to form a hockey team of the best student players available, and to train and complete schooling at the University of British Columbia.Oliver, Greg (2017), p. 6 Bauer had recently coached the Toronto St. Michael's Majors to the 1961 Memorial Cup championship, and won the 1944 Memorial Cup as a player. Roxburgh, Juckes and Bauer were in attendance at the 1962 World Championships, and discussed ideas for a national team.Oliver, Greg (2017), p. 5Young, Scott (1989), p. 246 Roxburgh invited Bauer to the 1962 general meeting to present the idea, which was tentatively approved by the delegates. Journalist Jim Coleman reported that consensus at the time was \\"for Canada to embark on a radical new course\\", even if it included establishing a team of university students to represent Canada at international hockey events.Oliver, Greg (2017), p. 82 Past president Roxburgh was succeeded by Art Potter as president of the CAHA in 1962. Roxburgh intended to stay involved with the CAHA as its past president, despite having political aspirations. Father Bauer's national team process was implemented at the CAHA executive meeting in August 1962. The CAHA and the team were criticized by Maury Van Vliet, who led the Alberta Golden Bears. He was opposed to a stacked team competing in the Canadian Interuniversity Athletic Union. Roxburgh responded stating that the team would not be competing in a league, but rather represent Canadian college hockey as a whole.Oliver, Greg (2017), p. 83 He further defended the decision and said, \\"Father Bauer is one of the greatest coaches in Canada\\". In advance of the upcoming Soviet Union winter tour of Canada in 1962, Roxburgh stated the junior Russian team would be tough competition for Canada, and the next generation of homegrown Russian players. Member of parliament Roxburgh served as a backbencher for three consecutive parliaments in the Chamber of the House of Commons of Canada (back benches pictured). 25th parliament Roxburgh began his political aspirations while still president of the CAHA, and skipped the 1962 Memorial Cup banquet due to preparations for the 1962 Canadian federal election. He was elected to the 25th Canadian Parliament on June 18, 1962, as the Liberal Party of Canada candidate in the riding of Norfolk, earning 10,882 votes. He said his opponent John Evans Knowles was a good man and good friend. After being elected, Roxburgh said he intended to be vocal about the Sports Advisory Council run by Jay Monteith, and how its committee members were chosen without input from Canadian sports associations like the CAHA. When parliament opened, Roxburgh took his seat as a backbencher. He was not the only hockey person in the Liberal caucus, which included Red Kelly of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and ice hockey referee Rodger Mitchell. During the 25th parliament, Roxburgh was a member of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Colonization, and the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills. He urged fellow members of parliament to keep politics out of the national fitness program, which saw the budget reduced to $1,000,000 from the $5,000,000 promised. He also lobbied to see more grants to promote physical fitness within Canada. 26th parliament Roxburgh's Norfolk riding was in the middle of the Ontario tobacco belt (tobacco farm pictured). Roxburgh was reelected in the 1963 Canadian federal election to represent the Norfolk riding on April 8, with 10,862 votes. During the first and second sessions of the 26th Canadian Parliament, he was a member of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Colonization; the Special Committee on Food and Drugs; the Standing Committee on Mines, Forests and Waters; the Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections; the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills; and the Standing Committee on Estimates. In the third session, he was a member of the Special Committee on Food and Drugs; the Standing Committee on Indian Affairs, Human Rights and Citizenship and Immigration; and the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development. In September 1964, Roxburgh supported legislation by Harry Hays, the Minister of Agriculture of Canada, to guarantee loans for groups of three or more farmers buying farm machinery. He stated, \\"farmers are the greatest group of co-operators in the world, and the only group for which this kind of legislation would really work\\". Since his Norfolk riding is the heart of the Ontario tobacco belt, he also sought larger federal grants for production and processing for the Canadian tobacco industry. In November 1964, a parliamentary committee was considered to investigate the structure of professional and amateur hockey relationship with respect to the contracts of junior-aged players. Red Kelly supported an inquiry saying that many Canadians opposed a system that tied a young man to an NHL team for life. Roxburgh defended the system stating that, an inquiry would \\"set the facts straight\\", and \\"might be of value in pointing out to the public the facts of the matter\\". =Canada's national game debate= In May 1964, Roxburgh did extensive research to find if Canadian parliament had ever declared a national game, and specifically looked into whether lacrosse was officially declared. After going through parliamentary records, he found no law was ever enacted. The Canadian Press reported at the time that the myth of lacrosse as Canada's national game possibly came from a book published in 1869 titled Lacrosse, the National Game of Canada, and that the Canadian Lacrosse Association was founded in 1867. His endeavour to declare hockey as Canada's national game coincided with the Great Canadian Flag Debate of 1964. On October 28, 1964, Roxburgh moved to introduce Bill C‚Äì132, with respect to declaring hockey as the national game of Canada, and submitted his opening resolution. Canadian Lacrosse Association members responded to the motion by calling it insulting and \\"out of line\\", and vowed to fight it. On June 11, 1965, Bob Prittie replied by introducing a separate bill to have lacrosse declared as Canada's national game and stated that, \\"I think it is fitting at this time when we are considering national flags, national anthems and other national symbols, that this particular matter should be settled now\\". The choice of Canada's national game was debated in 1965, but neither bill was passed when parliament was dissolved. In 1967, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson proposed to name national summer and winter games, but nothing was resolved. Finally in April 1994, Bill C‚Äì212 was passed to recognize hockey as Canada's official winter game, and lacrosse as its summer game. 27th parliament Roxburgh was reelected in the 1965 Canadian federal election to represent the Norfolk riding on November 8, with 9,833 votes. During the first and second sessions of the 27th Canadian Parliament, he was a member of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development; the Standing Committee on Northern Affairs and National Resources; the Standing Committee on Indian Affairs, Human Rights and Citizenship and Immigration; the Special Joint Committee on Immigration; the Special Committee on Drug Costs and Prices; the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Estimates; and the Special Joint Committee on the National and Royal Anthems. He also served as vice-chairman of the Standing Committee on Indian Affairs, Human Rights and Citizenship and Immigration. In April 1967, Roxburgh introduced Bill C‚Äì289, to amend the Canada Elections Act in favour of university students registering as voters. He stated that during the 1965 general election, students were unable to register in a new constituency when relocating for studies. He compared this to ministers and teachers being able to move into a new constituency between the beginning of the campaign period and polling day, and register as voters. The bill sought for registered university students be given the same privilege. Roxburgh campaigned for the 1968 Canadian federal election in the redistributed Norfolk‚ÄîHaldimand riding, as part of the Pierre Trudeau Liberal team. Roxburgh positioned himself as a self-described federalist, working for the farming community and encouraging youth to become involved. He received 13,132 votes, but was defeated by William David Knowles who was elected with 14,908 votes. Roxburgh's political career ended after the election, and 6 years and 7 days of service to the House of Commons of Canada. Personal life Roxburgh met his future wife Marion Seldon while they attended Ontario Agricultural College. The couple married and had two sons. He was known locally as \\"Roxy\\", and was a member of the Simcoe Kinsmen Club, the Simcoe Rotary Club, and St. James United Church. He nominated fellow farmer and municipal politician, John E. Cooper for the Haldimand‚ÄîNorfolk riding in the 1963 Ontario general election. After retiring, Roxburgh spent winters in Englewood, Florida. He and his wife were returning from an evening fishing trip on January 18, 1975, when their boat collided with a retaining wall in the dark. Roxburgh sustained internal injuries and was hospitalized. Plans were made for him to return to Canada in mid-February, but his condition worsened. He died on February 27, 1975, at a hospital in Venice, Florida at age 74. He was interred at Oakwood Cemetery in Simcoe, Ontario. Legacy and honours The Canadian Press reported Roxburgh as a man with a booming voice, and not known to be the silent type. After his election as CAHA president, he was honoured with a banquet organized by the Simcoe Minor Hockey Association to recognize his contributions to local and national ice hockey, and received a congratulatory telegram from the Soviet Union Ice Hockey Federation. He received the OHA Gold Stick in 1961, in recognition of contributions to hockey, and received the similar AHAUS citation award in 1962. Roxburgh received the CAHA's Order of Merit in 1971, for a lifetime of work in hockey.Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (1990). pp. 113‚Äì114 In 1973, he was made a life member of the OHA. He was inducted into the Norfolk County Sports Hall of Recognition in 1996. He was also made a life member of the OMHA, and is the namesake of the OMHA's Juvenile C playoff championship; the Jack Roxburgh Trophy.

It is a area stretching south along Main Street from the Erie Canal to the railroad tracks. Its buildings, all but three of which contribute to its historic character, reflect the development of Medina from the early days of the canal, where a bend in the route made it a natural harbor, in the 1830s to the 1920s. They are brick or stone buildings in a variety of architectural styles from the 19th century, primarily Italianate. Many of them have been renovated after a period of decline in the mid-20th century. In 1995 it was designated a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Two years later, a rail freight depot at the south end was added when further research established that it was historically related to other buildings in the district. Geography The district is an irregularly shaped area whose axis is Main Street for a block and a half north and south of East and West Center Street (NY 31 and 31E/63 respectively. South of the Main-Center intersection, Main Street is also itself part of routes 31 and 63). Its boundaries are defined by lot lines and streets. The terrain is level with a slight descent to the canal and creek at the northeast. At the north, the district includes the properties on the east side of Main north of Pearl Street that back on the canal just north of the bend it takes after crossing the Oak Orchard River to the immediate east. Its boundary continues along the rear property line of the east side of Main, excluding the parking lot at the canal basin, then expanding westward at East Center to include some properties on both sides of the street east of Manilla Place, stopping just short of St. John's Episcopal Church, the \\"Church in the Middle of the Street\\" and one of Medina's oldest public buildings. It then returns to the rear lines of the east side of Main, following the CSX railroad tracks back to the street. On the west side of Main it includes all the properties down to North Avenue. The district takes in the large railroad complex, excluding the hardware store on the corner with West Avenue, which it follows north to just past the tracks. The 1997 boundary increase added the Medina Railroad Museum across the street, extending the southwest corner of the district to Gwinn Street. After that the boundary crosses the street again and takes in the old train station building, then turns north at the back of City Hall to follow rear property lines on the east side of Main, including the buildings with frontage on the east side of Proctor Place. One lot south of Pearl Street, it turns east to exclude a house and vacant lot along that back to Main, which it then follows back up to the north end of the district. This tightly drawn boundary encloses an area of . Of the 52 buildings within it, only three are too modern to be considered contributing properties. There are no houses; most are multistory commercial buildings with a few having apartments above street level. The railroad-related properties, First Presbyterian Church and City Hall and its fire station are the few exceptions. It excludes Medina's Register-listed post office and St. John's, found eligible. History The settlement of what became Medina began with the announcement of the canal's construction in 1817. Within a few years some houses had sprung up for canal workers near the bend, and by 1825 the area in the northeastern portion of the district known as the docks, had been well developed, with a general store. At the time what is now Main Street was known as Shelby Street. None of those buildings are extant, mostly wood frame structures, are extant, having been demolished to make way for the current buildings. The foundation of the former Arcade at 343‚Äì347 Main Street is the only remnant of the village's early years still extant. In 1823 the Holland Land Company, the original European owners of much of Western New York, sent Ebenezer Mix to survey and lay out a village at the Ridgeway-Shelby town line. He completed this by 1826. This, combined with the settlement around the docks, became Medina. At that time, it was a way station along the canal for barges and an overnighting point for passengers. Many of its early buildings were hotels. Medina grew quickly. In addition to the canal it had good waterpower on Oak Orchard Creek (two mill races, one of which is reportedly still intact underground, ran along today's Main Street) and fertile land surrounding it. The settlement incorporated as a village in 1832, just seven years after its establishment. The 1840 census recorded 700 inhabitants. By the middle of the century the southwest portion of the village was being developed as a residential area. In 1855 the village's oldest extant hotel, the Paddock at 500‚Äì506 Main Street, was built. Around that time the Rochester, Lockport and Niagara Falls Railroad, the \\"Falls Road\\", was built through the village, at the southern end of the district. It took some, but not all, of the canal's traffic. By providing easier access to raw materials and markets for finished goods the railroad, which eventually became part of the New York Central Railroad, spurred industrial development along Main Street. The former main station, at 615 Main Street, built early in the 20th century, is one of the district buildings using locally quarried Medina sandstone, enjoying its peak usage as a building material at the time. At the same time the Rochester, Lockport and Buffalo Railroad offered electric trolley service that passed through Medina on tracks running along East Center, up Main and then to Commercial Street and east along a private right-of-way to Salt Works Road and then to West Center. A series of fires in the 1860s and 1870s led to the construction of most of the district's extant buildings between 1870 and 1900. As a result, they are visually cohesive and uniformly scaled. The most architecturally distinguished building in the district, Bent's Opera House at the northwest corner of Main and Center, is an early product of this period. The village had a diverse group of industries and retailers in the first decades of the 20th century. The fruit orchards in the farms around the village created a need for cold storage facilities near the railroad tracks. Three buildings, the warehouse at 630 Main Street that is now a carpet store, the 613-615 Main Street building and the railway museum building on West Street, reflect the importance of fruit growing at that time. So prosperous was Medina during this period that residents named the new municipal building in 1908 City Hall, out of the expectation that the village, now with a population of 5,000, would eventually become one. Most of those industries declined and eventually closed down over the next few decades. The canal, by then carrying a small fraction of its former traffic, was widened and incorporated into the New York State Barge Canal system in the late 1910s. It continued to decline. The railroads were affected as well. In 1931 the trolley service was discontinued; the tracks themselves remained for another 30 years. After World War II the market for Medina sandstone dwindled as well. Freight and passenger traffic across the state began using the New York State Thruway, 10 miles (16 km) to the south, and eventually the Central discontinued passenger service along the route before going bankrupt itself. The buildings of downtown Medina have remained. Many were restored and renovated with state and federal grant programs. The village has continued to benefit from the canal, which is now mainly a recreational resource but still carries some freight. Significant contributing properties The district's boundaries contain 54 buildings, one structure (the railroad tracks) and one site (Rotary Park, at the southeast corner of Main and Center). The park and three nearby buildings, as well as one near the train station, are the only non- contributing properties in the district. Among the others, some are notable within the context of the district. None have been listed individually on the National Register. *Austin and Dye Cold Storage Warehouse, 613‚Äì615 Main Street. A 1901 three-story Medina sandstone vernacular building that occupies the southeast corner of the district. *Bancroft Hotel, 343‚Äì347 Main Street. Its foundation dates to 1835, making it the oldest building element in the district. The rest of the building was replaced after a 1927 fire. Today it houses an auto-parts store. *Bent Block, 444 Main Street. Built in 1865, this Medina sandstone building once housed an opera house and was the center of Medina's cultural life. *Building at 415 Proctor Place. Records show that a public right-of-way once went through this former wagon shop with a bricked- over tunnel. *Building at 435 Main Street. The district's oldest building is a stone structure with brick facade built in 1846. *Building at 512 Main Street. This brick Italianate building has some excellent Art Deco storefronts with red and black Carrara glass. *Central Bank of Medina, 514 Main Street. The district's only neoclassical building dates to 1890, with a facade remodeled in 1926. *City Hall, 600 Main Street. The only government building in the district, built in 1908, is also its only Richardsonian Romanesque, with rockfaced Medina sandstone and round-headed arch moldings. Its name reflects the village's ambitions at the time of its construction. Modern rear addition is home to the fire department. *S.A. Cook Building, 526‚Äì540 Main Street. A long, horizontal brick building that was seen as very modern when it was built in 1911. *First Presbyterian Church, 520 Main Street. The district's only church is an 1872 brick Romanesque Revival structure set back slightly more from the street than its neighbors. *Fuller Block, 428 Main Street. Decoration on this 1875 Italianate commercial building includes drip molding on the round-arched windows, intricate brick corbelling and a bracketed cornice. Housed the local G. C. Murphy store for many years. *Hart House, 111‚Äì115 West Center Street. Built in 1876 as a hotel, this five-bay brick structure is one of the most accomplished of the Italianate buildings in the district, with full-height brick pilasters, segmentally arched windows, stone crowns and a bracketed cornice. *Maher Brothers Block, 116‚Äì120 East Center Street. This 1873 building is the only one with a neo-Renaissance facade, added 30 years after construction. *Medina Cold Storage Warehouse, 630 Main Street. Built in 1907, it is similar to the Austin and Dye building across the street. A wood frame packing house was added to the south elevation in the early 1920s. *Medina Railroad Museum, 530 West Street. A timber frame clapboard-sided structure built in 1905 that is believed to be the largest extant wooden freight depot in the country. It was converted to its present purpose in 1991. *New York Central Railroad Station, 615 West Street. A hip roofed structure presently used as a senior center, it was built in 1908 of mixed materials and remains mostly intact. *Paddock's Hotel, 500‚Äì506 Main Street. The oldest hotel building in the district dates to 1855. Preservation Medina has made the district part of a historic overlay district in its zoning code. The village's district includes some areas outside of the Register-listed one, such as an extension north to Eagle Street and more of East Center Street along the canal basin. It is meant to protect the district's historic character within the context of Medina's commercial zoning.Genesee/Finger Lakes Regional Planning Council, , December 2009, retrieved September 3, 2010. In 2009 the Genesee/Finger Lakes Regional Planning Commission, with the cooperation of the village and representatives of its downtown business community, drafted a revitalization plan for the district. Business and consumers were surveyed to get data as to what they thought downtown's issues were. Consumers were also asked where they came from and how they used downtown. Businesses, many of which were independent and owned the space they operated from, represented a diverse group of activities, primarily retail goods and services. They employed about 222 people. Most indicated that what they would be most interested in to improve downtown was grant or loan programs to assist with business improvements. Half of them thought parking was an issue for their customers. The customers surveyed were primarily older women. Most were residents of the area who drove downtown to shop (usually at the grocery or drugstore) and attend to personal care needs. They came to downtown a few times a month and were most likely otherwise to go to a big box retailer, shops in nearby towns like Albion or Middleport or malls in the Buffalo area to the southwest. They liked the small-town feel of downtown, but felt it could use more parking and more attention to the appearance of vacant buildings. The plan recommended that the village add a section to its comprehensive plan dealing with downtown. Specific measures that were suggested to address the issues were several measures to instill pride in the historic downtown, such as the redistribution of sections of the Register application to promote awareness of the district's historic qualities, a window display program in vacant storefronts, making property owners aware of the tax credits available to them for renovating income-producing property, and the creation of a Business Improvement District. A separate parking overlay was suggested, based on recalculated demand, to address that issue.
