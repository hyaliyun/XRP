She was also a business woman and inventor before she became a physician later in life. Early years and education Sarah (or Sara) Julia Newcomb was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada, 9 May 1844. Her parents were John Burton Newcomb and Emily A. Prince. Her six siblings included, Simon (the astronomer), Thomas, Harriet, Richard, James, and John. Merrick was a descendant of William Brewster, a Pilgrim. She counted among her ancestors some of the most notable New England names. She was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution by virtue of her great-grandfather, Simon Newcomb, having, with others, instigated rebellion in Nova Scotia. The rebellion was quelled soon after Mr. Newcomb's death in 1776. Forty-one of his kinsmen avenged his death by taking an active part in the war in the New England and other States. She was orphaned at the age of seven, which hampered the education she sought to become a school teacher. In her earliest childhood, she played at teaching, and when barely nine years of age, offered her services to a missionary as a teacher for the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia. In 1860, she reached the United States, and the following year, entered the public schools of Boston. Through the financial assistance of her oldest brother, she remained there till 1867, when she was graduated in the Girls' High and Normal School. Career=Teacher= Merrick's first teaching position was in Manassas, Virginia. There, she not only worked throughout the week, but on Sunday afternoon, lead the children in scripture lessons, illustrated on the blackboard. That drew the attention of a Baltimore clergyman, and he strongly urged her to leave teaching and take up divinity, assuring her of a license from the Baltimore Synod. She declined, and resolved that nothing should change her mind about her chosen field. Hearing of Texas as a new opportunity for teachers, she removed there and taught at the Freedmen's Bureau School for Colored Children. In September, 1872, she was appointed principal of Third Ward Colored School, a public school in San Antonio, a position she held for eighteen years. On 14 August 1876, she married Morgan Wolfe Merrick (1839‚Äì1919), a surveyor and Confederate Army veteran. An infant son died before a daughter, Julia, was born in 1878. Even after marriage, she continued to teach. For over two years, Merrick was a paid contributor to the Texas School Journal, and it was through her work that San Antonio had the reputation of having the best primary schools in the State. =Writer and business woman= Writer's cramp affected her right hand around 1883. She then learned how to write with her left hand, while she was in the meantime perfecting her invention of a pen-holder to fit on the finger like a thimble to avoid hand cramps. It was patented in 1887. Her investments in real estate in San Antonio proved profitable, and Merrick was considered a good business woman. She was president of the Business Woman's Association after it was formed San Antonio. After retiring from active work in the school room around 1890, she intended to continue her work in the cause of education through her writing. In 1910, she published a biography about her father and brother, Simon, in McClure's. =Homeopath= In the mid-1890s, Merrick left her husband and returned to Boston, where she graduated in 1897 from Boston University School of Medicine. Four years later, she provided support for an antivivisection bill, and by 1903, she was a leader in Boston's antivaccinationist movement. She worked as a physician and pharmacist at the Roxbury Homeopathic Dispensary.

Donner was an American Great Lakes freighter that was built in 1914 by the Great Lakes Engineering Works of Ashtabula, Ohio for service on the Great Lakes of North America. She was used to transport bulk cargoes such as iron ore, coal, grain and occasionally limestone. She operated from 1914 as a bulk carrier to 1970 when she was converted to a floating crane that remained in service until 2016. History The Donner was launched on May 7, 1914 as hull number #134. She had a length of 524-feet, a beam of 54-feet and a height of 30-feet. She was built using the Isherwood System of longitudinal construction of ships, powered by a 1,900 horsepower triple expansion steam engine and fueled by two coal-fired Scotch marine boilers. She had the official number U.S. #212354. She was commissioned by the Mahonig Steamship Company ( M.A. Hanna & Co., Mgr.) of Cleveland, Ohio. Her homeport was Fairport, Ohio. She entered service on July 7, 1914 clearing Ecorse, Michigan bound for Cleveland, Ohio. In 1929 the Donner was transferred to the Bethlehem Transportation Corporation (H.K. Oakes, Mgr.) of Cleveland. In 1955 she was re-registered to Wilmington, Delaware. In 1956 she was converted to a crane ship with two revolving cranes by the American Ship Building Company of Toledo, Ohio. In 1970 the Donner was sold to the Miller Compressing Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin for use as a freight transfer vessel at Milwaukee. In 1992 she was sold to K & K Warehousing and towed to Menominee, Michigan, then later to Marinette, Wisconsin to again serve as a freight transfer vessel. In 2002 the Donner's pilothouse was removed. The final retirement of the old vessel came in March of 2016 - after 102 years of service - when she was towed to the Menominee River and moored to await scrapping.

The terminals consist of four smiley-faced buttons that customers are invited to press to indicate whether they are very happy, happy, unhappy or very unhappy with the service they were provided. This information is used by companies to find points where they are providing suboptimal service and to improve it. By June 2019 there were 30,000 terminals in use throughout 130 countries and over one billion button pushes had been recorded. History=2009-2014= A HappyOrNot terminal at Heathrow Airport The company was founded by Heikki V√§√§n√§nen and Ville Levaniemi in 2009. The premise for the company lingered in the mind of Heikki V√§√§n√§nen for about 10 years. As a teenager, he received poor service at an electronics trade shop and left disappointed. He didn‚Äôt provide any feedback as it couldn‚Äôt be done easily. This disappointment weighed on his mind and after deliberating over the situation for nearly a decade, he came up with the idea of giving the customer an easy way to provide feedback and introduced this idea to his former colleague, Ville Levaniemi. After checking to see if the idea already existed, they went to meet with potential customers. After sharing their idea and receiving positive feedback, the company was set up in 2009. Based on discussions with the potential customers, the numbers of the buttons on the device expanded from two to four. Two buttons would not give enough information; with three buttons most of the responses would fall to the middle one; so it was determined that four buttons would provide the correct distribution of feedback. V√§√§n√§nen and Levaniemi started the company with the money they raised from the sale of their company, Universomo, and contacted a Finnish manufacturer to build the terminals. Their first big customer was one of Finland's big-three supermarket groups curious to gauge the freshness of their vegetables and fruits. Shortly thereafter, Heathrow Airport in London and French Carrefour started using the service. Heathrow drew international attention and prominence to the company as it related to business leaders. The company‚Äôs Florida‚Äôs headquarters were established in 2014. =2015-= In 2016, the company's turnover was EUR 4.4 million , of which exports accounted for over 90%. It had employees in the UK, Germany, Singapore, Finland and the United States. By October 2017, there were 11 different nationalities among 65 employees. At this time, the company had about 4,000 customers in 100 countries deploying 25,000 terminals.. Concurrently, the company received an investment of EUR 14.5 million from two international venture capitalists, Northzone, (first back of Spotify), and Nordicand AirTree Ventures from Australia which boosted growth at home and in the United States, Britain and Germany. This type of investment was exceptionally high for a Finnish startup. With the investment, Northzone‚Äôs Marta Sj√∂gren began advising the founders in scaling the company. Marketing was focused on quality and concentrated in the company‚Äôs best markets, particularly in the United States. The company‚Äôs global reseller network topped over 100 companies. The year 2018, saw growth to 160 employees and a turnover of 7.7 million euros. A 4-page story in the New Yorker Magazine in February 2018, spiked awareness with customers, investors and job seekers as well as media interest from the BBC and NBC. V√§√§n√§nen also became a content producer for Forbes. In 2019 there were HappyOrNot terminals in 130 countries and over one billion button pushes had been recorded. Organization HappyOrNot established a Board of Directors in 2014. The Chairman of the Board is Tero Luoma, investor of Taaleri. They held their meetings regularly via Skype, GoToMeeting and the WhatsApp Group application. Business is conducted with the majority of time spent on discussion new opportunities instead of viewing old business and reports. The Board of Directors received ‚ÄúThe Golden Mallet‚Äù for their good work in 2017 from Hallituspartnerit. The products A HappyOrNot terminal in Tampere, Finland, 2019 The premise behind HappyOrNot‚Äôs products and services is that people are busy and don‚Äôt want to give up their time to provide feedback. Selecting sentiment from one of four smileys is easy, it takes no time at all and is anonymous. No thought is required, no analyzing service levels, for example on a scale from one to ten. Everyone can participate and provide feedback, there are no barriers due to age, culture or language. Additionally, those providing feedback do so anonymously without risk of identify theft thus companies are not required to reference GDPR requirements. While the devices are used the collect the feedback; HappyOrNot analytical reporting assists clients with interpretation of the data. For example, a retail chain noted that their sales were stronger in the afternoon and was looking for the reason why mornings were not as good. Analytics revealed them that customers in the afternoon were in fact less satisfied with their service so if the amount of sales staff would be increased, sales would probably increase as well. In addition to terminals, there are versions that work on smartphones and webpages. The data that is collected by the devices is analyzed and used by companies to guide customer service and customer experience improvements. The service can also be used to monitor and measure employee sentiment. With devices in the workplace the companies can collect continuous feedback, quickly access and analyze reporting to be able to react immediately to situations that are occurring. The terminals normally only upload data once a day (via the mobile phone network) to preserve the battery. Future versions are planned to require lower-powered Narrowband IoT technology that will allow terminals to be constantly connected. Customers The company has thousands of customers in locations such as airports, shops and hospitals. A sample of customers include: Levi‚Äôs Stadium, home to the San Francisco 49ers, Biltema, Carrefour, City of Helsinki, Ikea, Vianor , Walmart, United States Border Guard and Zara . Also Heathrow and Southend airports use HappyOrNot terminals. Among the companies that have used company's service to measure employee satisfaction are Gigantti, Nordea, Microsoft, DHL, LinkedIn and eBAy. Awards & recognition *In 2015 **HappyOrNot won National Champion at the European Business Awards (EBA) **HappyOrNot was ranked as one the fastest growing companies in Finland by Kauppalehti, number four in the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 in Finland and number 66 on the total Deloitte Technology Fast 500 EMEA **Ernst & Young named Heikki V√§√§n√§nen, the CEO, Young Entrepreneur of the Year *In 2017, the company was ranked 212th on the FT1000 Europe's Fastest Growing Companies list maintained by the Financial Times. *In 2018, HappyOrNot was chosen as one of WIRED‚Äôs Hottest Startups in Finland.

They typically have one or more of their natural soil horizons modified, removed or replaced. The word anthroposol is derived from the Greek words anthropos, meaning man and genes meaning caused. Anthroposols are typically found on industrial, commercial, urban and resources extraction sites as well as throughout transportation, fuel and power corridors.  Classification of Anthroposols  Soil classification systems are used globally to systematically categorize soils based on diagnostic features or characteristics. Human-formed soils have historically been excluded from soil classification systems due in part to the fact that the criteria used for naturally-formed soils are often not applicable. However, many countries are recognizing their pervasiveness and the need for some type of common language and taxonomy. As of 2016, fifteen countries had added (or proposed adding) anthropogenic soils to their soil classification systems including Brazil, Germany, Canada, Poland and China. They are known by many terms including: Plaggen soils, Paddy soils, Oasis soils, Terra Preta do Indio (Brazil), Agrozems (Russia), Terrestriche anthropogene B√∂den (Germany), Anthroposols (Australia and Canada) and Anthrosols (China).Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2006). World reference base for soil resources 2006 = World Reference Base for Soil Resources = The World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) offers some guidelines for classification. This system is based on a large scale and is not meant to replace national or local systems but rather to facilitate communication between them. The FAO World Soil Resources Report 2006 offers full details. It outlines two larger anthropogenic sub-categories based on the degree of disturbance as well as the pervasiveness of the artifacts within: * Anthrosol: soils under agricultural cultivation for long periods * Technosol: soils containing products and artifacts of industrial processes (often toxic). These could include constructed soils used for closure of landfills and mines and soils under pavement. = National Soil Classification Systems = Each country varies slightly in their diagnostic features and taxonomic structure for soil classification systems as local needs and soil-forming processes are highly variable.  France  First implemented in 1995, three sub groups are included: * Transform√©s: changed by agriculture * Reconstitutes: for use in agriculture * Artificiels: urban soils  Azerbaijan  There are two broader categories within the framework of anthropogenically modified and technogenically disturbed: * Urbanzems: open and unsealed by paving structures * Ekranozems: sealed with paving  United Kingdom  Artificial ground is the term used for anthropogenic soils and is given four classes: * Made: artificial soils have been placed on top of an existing naturally-formed soil surface * Worked: naturally-formed soils have been removed * Infilled: naturally-formed soils have been removed and artificial soil has been added * Landscaped: extensive remodeling such that one cannot readily distinguish between the areas where the above methods are used  Canada  As outlined by Naeth et al. (2012) \\"Anthroposols are azonal soils, highly modified or constructed by human activity, with one or more natural horizons removed, removed and replaced, added to, or significantly modified.\\" The defining features of Anthroposols are: *Anthroposol under an urban lawnhorizons have been removed, replaced, added to or severely modified by humans * manufactured items (artifacts) are present A depth of anthropogenic disturbance (of either modification or addition) must be of at least 10 cm above or below the soil surface for a soil to be categorized as an Anthroposol. Minimal disturbance would likely still allow the natural soil formation process to be identified. Tilled soils are not included in the proposed Anthroposolic order within the Canadian System of Soil Classification and this disturbance is covered by use of suffix p to indicate a plowed horizon within other soil orders. Anthroposols; however, can occur on agricultural soils when substantial disturbance goes beyond typical tillage (e.g., land levelling that alters natural soil profiles through excavation and burial, pipeline or well construction). Since Anthroposolic soils are commonly developed by human activity with anthropogenic materials, this precludes these soils from classification in the existing classification categories. The first problem is identification of the order for the modified or reconstructed soil, since the existing classification system is applicable only for soils that have been forming under natural conditions. The second problem is determining the most likely trajectory soil development would take. Proposed categorization within the Canadian System of Soil Classification. = Order = Anthroposol - \\"soil that has been visibly disturbed by human activity and that have a D horizon [equal to or greater than] 10 cm thick or have had natural soil horizons removed.\\"Pennock, D.J., K.

Both were critically acclaimed in the American press, and were translated into many languages. He also founded and edited the literary journals Arion‚Äôs Dolphin, Erato and Harvard Review.  Early life and education  Haviaras‚Äôs parents were refugees from Asia Minor who settled in Nea Kios (Argos) when it was founded in 1927. As a child he experienced the horrors of World War II. When he was 9, the Nazis executed his father, Christos, for his participation in the resistance, while his mother, Georgia Hatzikyriakos, was sent to a concentration camp in Germany. Subsequently the family house was demolished by the occupying forces. After finishing grammar school, Haviaras started working in the construction trades. In battling the twin obstacles of Attention Deficit Disorder and dyslexia, his love for writing found ways to persevere. He began to write poems and plays at age 13. A milestone in his engagement with the literary world was his acquaintance, starting in 1957, with Kimon Friar, a distinguished translator into English of The Odyssey: a Modern Sequel by Nikos Kazantzakis, whom he met in Athens. Recognizing Haviaras‚Äôs passion for literature and writing, Friar invited him to travel to the United States to assist him in the translation of Kazantzakis‚Äôs Salvatores Dei: Spiritual exercises, and reading of essays on US arts over The Voice of America radio, and in the typing of archival material. Through Friar, Haviaras met Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe, Tennessee Williams, William Inge, among others. During his stay in the U.S. he also studied mechanical drawing at the Manhattan Technological Institute in New York, and machine design at the Jefferson School of Commerce in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he lived with relatives, working in the evenings in a Greek restaurant. At the University of Virginia, he met William Faulkner and worked with the young writer Richard Fari√±a, three years before his death.  Career = First publications in Greek = Haviaras first appeared in the Greek letters with the dramatic monologue \\"The Rusty Nail\\" (Kainouria Epochi, Summer 1959), later performed in The Actors Studio in New York. Upon his return to Greece in April 1961, he found work in the US Airbase in Athens. That same year he met the author, Katerina Plassara, with whom he traveled to France, Germany and Scandinavia, writing plays. In 1963 he published his first collection of poems, Œó Œ∫œÖœÅŒØŒ± ŒºŒµ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄœÖŒæŒØŒ¥Œ± (Lady with a Compass) and for the next few years he worked as a supervising engineer in the construction of the Achelous River hydroelectric dam. His second book of poetry, ŒíŒµœÅŒøŒªŒØŒΩŒø (Berlin), was published in 1965. During Greece‚Äôs political turmoil, which culminated in the military takeover of the government in April, 1967, Haviaras participated in pro-democracy rallies in Athens (and later in Cambridge, Massachusetts). His next collection of poems Œó ŒΩœçœáœÑŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒæœÖŒªŒøœÄœåŒ¥Œ±œÅŒøœÖ (Night of the Stiltwalker), amply reflects his opposition to totalitarian rule ‚Äì it was confiscated by the police soon after it appeared in the bookstores. In Athens, in the autumn of 1966 Haviaras found work as a draftsman in The Architects Collaborative (TAC), founded by Walter Gropius. There he met the architect Gail Flynn, whom he married in 1967. That year he moved with her to the United States. = Harvard = In Cambridge, Massachusetts, Haviaras worked as a clerk at Harvard‚Äôs Widener Library and joined The Committee for the Restoration of the Democratic Government in Greece, founded by members of the academic community. Soon he became editor and one of the speakers of its Sunday program, The Voice of Greece, broadcasting over WILD Radio Boston against the military dictatorship in Greece. Following a complaint by ‚ÄúTwenty Greek-American businessmen,‚Äù the Federal Communications Commission imposed the submission of translated texts from Greek to English and vice versa 96 hours before broadcasting, in essence silencing the program. The Committee continued its activities with Eleutheria, a monthly publication. In 1971 Haviaras joined a think tank formed in Cambridge by members of the organization ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒÜŒºœÖŒΩŒ± (Democratic Defense), which operated underground in Greece. As its representative from America, Haviaras travelled to Bonn, Germany in August of that year to participate in an international conference aimed at the restoration of democracy in Greece. While working at Harvard, Haviaras attended courses in literature and history at the university‚Äôs evening and summer programs. He completed his undergraduate and postgraduate studies in literature and creative writing respectively (BA 1973, MFA 1976) at the low residency program of Goddard College in Vermont. At Goddard he met many writers, including Raymond Carver, John Irving, and Richard Ford, and he launched Arion's Dolphin, a hand-stitched poetry journal. 1973 was a landmark year for his literary career. He began writing in English, and many of his poems appeared in literary journals such as Iowa Review, Ploughshares, Dickinson Review, and Kayak. In 1976 his first poetry collection in English, Crossing the River Twice was published by the Cleveland State University Poetry Center. At Harvard he was successively promoted to positions of greater responsibility until in 1974 he was appointed Curator of the Woodberry Poetry Room and the Henry Weston Farnsworth Room, two specialized collections in the Harvard College Library system. In 1976 Haviaras began to live with Heather Cole, a librarian at Harvard. The couple was married in 1990 at the suggestion of their daughter, Elektra Haviaras (b. 1981).Patrick Skene Catling, ‚ÄúPoetic Fruits of War‚Äù The Sunday Telegraph In 1979, Simon & Schuster published his novels When the Tree Sings and in 1984, The Heroic Age. As Curator of the Poetry and Farnsworth Rooms, Haviaras was responsible for selecting works of poetry from the English-speaking world and making studio recordings of poets reading from their own work. Equally importantly, he organized weekly gatherings, book presentations, poetry readings and publications. In 1984 and for the next 24 years he taught a successful novel-writing workshop at Harvard‚Äôs summer program, and with his assistant, the poet Michael Milburn, he edited and published large selections from sound recordings (Vladimir Nabokov at Harvard and Seamus Heaney at Harvard), and the literary magazine ERATO. In 1992 he launched Harvard Review, a major publishing effort, now edited by Christina Thompson and associates. After completing 40 years of service at the University, a fund for an annual poetry lecture to honor Stratis Haviaras was established in the Department of English and American Literature and Language by a grant from film maker Robert Gardner and a donation from the poet Elizabeth Gray. = Return to Greece and the Greek language = Haviaras retired from the library at Harvard in the year 2000 but continued to teach in the Summer Program until 2008, completing 40 years of service, when he took up permanent residence in Athens. As a writer, he returned to the Greek language with AXNA, a novel (Kedros, 2014) and the teaching of creative writing at the European Center for the Translation of Literature (EKEMEL), of which he was President in 2000, and the National Book Center of Greece (EKEBI). He also served as Vice President of the Greek Authors Society (2011‚Äì2013), and since 2015 he coordinated a creative writing workshop at the Center for Hellenic Studies of Harvard University in Nafplion, Greece. Since 2013 he had been publishing poems and translations of poetry in the Athens journal Ta Poetika and his short stories and memoir ~~e~~ s in oanagnostis.gr an e-magazine for the book, of whose editorial board he was a member. Haviaras was the translator into English of C.P. Cavafy The Canon (Hermes Publishing 2000, Center for Hellenic Studies, Harvard University Press, 2007) and collaborated with others in the translation of works by Seamus Heaney and Charles Simic into Greek.

It is found only in Whangamarino Wetland in the Waikato District, where the population of fewer than 250 plants is critically endangered.  Description  Corybas carsei growing in Whangamarino Wetland, New Zealand This small orchid grows from a single leaf 10‚Äì25 mm long, and flowers in September to November. Its single flower stands only 1‚Äì 3 cm tall, and has a hooded appearance as the maroon uppermost sepal hides most of the petals. Its petals are white with a maroon base and 8‚Äì10 pink/maroon stripes. Its seed capsule is 5‚Äì6 cm tall, and contains dust-like seeds dispersed by the wind. Like other orchids, the seeds have no food reserves and need a symbiotic fungus to provide the energy to germinate.  Taxonomy  Corybas carsei was described by Thomas Cheeseman in 1911, and named Corysanthes carsei after schoolteacher Harry Carse who, with Blen Matthews, collected the type specimen from swamps near Lake Tangonge, Kaitaia. It was moved to the genus Corybas (a senior synonym) in 1945. A 2002 revision of Corybas split it into numerous genera and placed this species in the genus Anzybas, but this is not widely accepted. Distribution and habitat The swamp helmet orchid prefers open, disturbed wetlands and grows best amongst liverworts and mosses. It is only known from the Whangamarino Wetland. It is similar to the Australian species C. fordhamii and more research is needed to confirm that the two species are separate.  Conservation  Corybas carsei is listed as \\"threatened - nationally critical\\" by the New Zealand Government Department of Conservation. The main threat to C. carsei is modification of wetlands, both from draining for agriculture and increased nutrients from pastoral farming. Nutrients allow the invasion of other plant species that can swamp the orchid in dense vegetation. This species was once found as far north as Kaitaia and south to Moanatuatua Swamp in the Waikato, but by the mid-20th century was presumed extinct. It was rediscovered in the early 1980s in Whangamarino Wetland, near Te Kauwhata, during a survey to counter proposals to drain the wetland. Whangamarino once underwent regular fires sparked by land clearance and steam trains, but after active fire suppression began in the 1960s its vegetation changed from the mosaic of open mossy sites favoured by the orchids to tall sedges and grasses, and by 1991 the wild population of C. carsei had dropped to only 30 individuals. To rescue the species, the Department of Conservation (DOC) began in 1994 to mimic natural disturbance by setting fires in fenced plots, in winter when the ground was damp so the underlying peat did not ignite. The aim was to simulate fires caused by lightning strikes and more recently by human activity. After fire, C. carsei reappears at higher densities and flowers and sets seed more heavily. Without a fire regime, only a few of the orchids flower each year, so a winter burn every seven years is now part of its management plan. Corybas carsei is so vulnerable that New Zealand Geographic were only allowed to photograph plants on condition they did not reveal their exact location. The DOC conservation status of the species is \\"Nationally Critical\\" because of its small fluctuating population size (less than 250 individuals), single tiny home range, and dependence on continued conservation management. Its numbers have gradually increased, from 77 plants in 2008 to 195 in 2011.

The definition may involve the film having a black cast, a black crew, a black director, a black story, or a focus on black audiences. Academic Romi Crawford said, \\"I think a black film is a film work that takes into account in some way the relationship of African-Americans or blacks from the African Diaspora to filmmaking practice, means and industry. For me, it's in that relation between blacks and the film industry. How one engages in that relationship can be a mixture of black director and black acting talent; black director and black content in story; black content in story, no black director; black production money, nothing else that reads as black.\\" Chicago Tribunes Allan Johnson said in 2005 that the definition is blurred by black actors who star in films where their ethnicity is unrelated to their character, such as Denzel Washington, Jamie Foxx, Will Smith, and Halle Berry. Several black directors also have directed films unrelated to their ethnicity, including Antoine Fuqua, Angela Robinson, and Tim Story. The American Black Film Festival was created by marketing executive Jeff Friday, who created the criteria for a film to qualify as a best picture candidate. A film must have eight points to qualify. Four points are given for each executive producer, producer, writer, director, and lead actor and actress involved with the film. Two points are given for each supporting actor and actress. Friday acknowledged the varied possibilities of the scoring system and said part of the goal of the award ceremony was also to recognize people of color behind the camera.

At present he is a professor at the Department of Engineering Science at Uppsala University, Sweden. As a scientist he has concentrated on solving both physics and engineering problems related to lightning physics, lightning protection and physics of electrical discharges. This research work has resulted in more than 350 research publications. He is the Ph.D. thesis supervisor of more than thirty researchers, both at Uppsala and foreign universities, who are now actively engaged in lightning research and lightning protection in different parts of the world.  Early Life and Career  After completing his primary and secondary education at De Mazenod College, Kandana, Sri Lanka, he joined the University of Colombo in 1971 and obtained an honours degree in physics with a first class in 1976. In 1978 he enrolled as a Ph.D. student at Uppsala University. His thesis advisor was Professor Stig Lundquist who was a plasma physicist and a student of the noble laureate Hannes Alfv√©n of Sweden. After his Ph.D., Vernon Cooray was absorbed into the world renowned lightning research group of Uppsala University. Continuing the tradition of lightning research at Uppsala University he has made major contributions in the fields of lightning research, lightning protection and physics of laboratory sparks. In 2000 he was promoted to a full professor at Uppsala University and between 2000 and 2002 he was the head of the division of electricity. In 2014 he was elected as the president of the International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP) for a period of six years. ICLP is considered as the most prestigious conference in the world that addresses the problems related to lightning physics and lightning protection and attended by lightning researchers and engineers from all over the world. At present, he is the professor responsible for the research and Ph.D. studies in the field of atmospheric electrical discharges at Uppsala University. Vernon Cooray has also contributed to educate the general public on lightning and lightning protection through newspapers, radio and television.  Research  Vernon Cooray has made many contribution in lightning research and lightning protection. Some of his notable contributions are the following. He is the first scientist to show that the basic foundation of all engineering return stroke models are the same even though they are expressed in different mathematical formulations. He is also the first scientist to resolve one of the controversies that existed in 1980s between the EMC engineers and Power engineers related to the theories of interaction of lightning electromagnetic fields with power lines by showing that a model developed by Prof. Sune Rusck, and used frequently by power engineers, is identical to the model developed by Agrawal et al., frequently used by EMC engineers. He and his collaborators were the first group of scientists to show that lightning cloud flashes are as efficient as lightning ground flashes in generating nitrogen oxides. He together with Prof. Marcos Rubinstein developed the Cooray-Rubinstein approximation which is frequently used in analysing the voltages induced in power lines by lightning. Vernon Cooray and Marley Becerra developed the lightning interaction simulation program SLIM that can be used to predict the location of lightning strikes to structures. More recently, he together with Dr. Gerald Cooray illustrated a connection between classical electromagnetic fields and time energy uncertainty principle.  Achievements  In addition to numerous scientific publications, Vernon Cooray has edited three books and authored two books on lightning physics and lightning protection. He has been awarded the Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) honorary degree from University of Colombo in Sri Lanka, the IEEE fellow membership, the Karl Berger award from the international scientific committee of ICLP, and the best book award from the Atmospheric Science Librarians International (ASLI).

First U.S. Army presence The Isthmian Canal Commission and the Panama Canal Guard of 1904‚Äì1914 both played a pivotal role in the construction and early defense of the Canal.Global Security With the active support and encouragement of the United States, Panama declared its independence from Colombia on 3 Nov. 1903 and that same month, the United States received the right to build and administer the Panama Canal. On 8 Mar. 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed an Isthmian Canal Commission (ICC), composed primarily of Army officers, to govern the Canal Zone and to report directly to the Secretary of War.Almanac of Theodore Roosevelt In 1907, President Roosevelt appointed Army Lt. Col. George W. Goethals to the post of Chief Engineer of the ICC, officially turning construction of the Canal into a military project. To more adequately protect the Canal from external threats, the Army conducted an on-site survey in 1910 and began building defensive fortifications in 1911‚Äîto include Fort De Lesseps, Fort Randolph, and Fort Sherman on the Atlantic side, and Fort Amador and Grant on the Pacific side. On 4 Oct. 1911, a regiment of the U.S. Army 10th Infantry arrived at Camp E.S. Otis, on the Pacific side of the isthmus. They would form the nucleus of a mobile force that grew to include other infantry, cavalry, engineer, signal, and field artillery units, as well as a Marine battalion that had protected the Canal since 1904. Together these troops, under the control of the ICC, were known as the Panama Canal Guard. Panama Canal Department The Panama Canal Department was created as a separate command of the United States Army on 26 June 1917 by separation from the Eastern Department. The department was initially headquartered at Anc√≥n, relocating to Quarry Heights on 1 April 1920. It was responsible for the defense of the Canal Zone, including land areas, coastal defenses, harbor defenses, air defenses, and sea defenses within medium bomber range. The department was also responsible for the laying, maintaining, and clearing of harbor defense minefields that were to be placed at the canal entrance in event of a war. In event of a war, it was to defend against landings at either end of the Canal, coordinating with forces of the United States Navy. The department controlled the major land force in the Canal Zone, the Panama Canal Division, which was activated in 1921. The division included two infantry brigades: the 19th, responsible for the Atlantic side of the canal, and the 20th, responsible for the Pacific side. The department included a separate command, the Panama Coast Artillery District, which was to provide coast defense against seaborne invasion. The division was disbanded in 1932. Later, the Panama Mobile Force was activated on 16 February 1940 by Panama Canal Department commander, Lieutenant General Daniel Van Voorhis in order to improve defense of the Panama Canal Zone. Four infantry and one engineer regiment, plus two artillery battalions were assigned to the Mobile Force, even after World War II began. The plan to defend the Canal Zone was to conduct a mobile defense in depth beginning at the beaches and not by preparing and holding static defense positions. The Atlantic side was considered the least likely invasion route because the few landing areas there were too small to allow the discharge of numerous forces simultaneously. On 10 February 1941, the Caribbean Defense Command was established as a theater command responsible for tactical control of the Panama Canal and Puerto Rican Departments, as well as bases in the Caribbean, eventually taking control of air and naval forces as well. It was co-located with the department headquarters at Quarry Heights, under the command of the department commander. During World War II, the department reached its peak strength in January 1943, when 68,000 men were under its control. On 1 November 1947 it was replaced by United States Army Caribbean, part of the joint United States Caribbean Command.

But it also featured a mere 4K of RAM (along with its 8K of ROM) with only about 1.7K free for BASIC programs, a \\"chicklet\\" keyboard with just 48 keys (on an 8-line-in, 6-line-out matrix) and a reset button, a one-voice tone generator for sound, no programmable graphics, no sprites, no game controllers, no monitor port (it attached to a TV only), a non-standard printer interface, ordinary cassette access at 600 baud, and no expansion capability except for what could be plugged into the cartridge port. Given that the unit was introduced in 1983, these features did not make it strongly competitive in the home computer market. To address some of the limitations, Mattel added a larger character set to the original Radofin design, so that games could use character graphics.

Despite its completion, the play was never performed as it was banned under the Licensing Act 1737. The play received considerable backlash from Wallace for its scrutiny towards her work and the subsequent removal of it from theatrical production. Overview The Whim is set in 18th century English society under the estate of Lord Crotchett--a wealthy noble who has decided to entertain the idea of hosting an ancient event known as the Feast of Saturnalia. The feast challenged the social structure of 18th century England at the time by inverting the roles of nobility and the servant class. This may have likely been the reason for the play's ban, preventing it from being performed in theaters after 1795 under the Licensing Act of 1737. While Lord Crotchett's role as master to the estate was changed to a servant, Nell and Fag (two of the former servants) are put in charge of the estate for the day due to their low social class standing. The play follows the drama and events which Nell and Fag take part in, ultimately culminating in the marriage between Maria (a head maid) and Caesar (a disguised noble not originally from the estate). While Lord Crotchett does not consent to the marriage initially, he permits it and even condones it as he does not have the power to deny Fag or Nell in this social structure. Criticism and interpretation Wallace's public image was apparently well received in London on her return in 1793 while she was entertaining General Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez. However, her distaste for English government surfaced in The Whim in both the preface and the general themes of the play. Due to the Licensing Act of 1737 being in effect, Wallace's play was silenced before it could be publicly performed, leaving it to manuscript formats only. Many theater historians have argued that the censorship of Wallace's The Whim only further highlighted the impact of the Licensing Act of 1737 which was still in effect at the time. Historians also argue that the censoring of this play only demonstrated the overpowering nature of the Examiner of Plays and how it impacted British theater during the late 18th century, effectively sterilizing theaters of any non-favorable political themes or alignments.

A representation of the Anglo- Saxon helmet by the same name found in the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, it was commissioned by the National Trust to suspend outside an exhibition hall at the Sutton Hoo visitor centre. At the opening of the centre, the sculpture was unveiled by the Literature Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney on 13 March 2002. It remained in place, dominating the entrance of the exhibition hall, until 2019, when it was moved to the entrance to the Sutton Hoo site. The sculpture is high, wide, deep, and weighs . It is made of mild steel plates that are coloured red. Designed to have a \\"fierce presence\\", it is inspired by the fragmentary appearance of the reconstructed helmet rather than the glistening replica made by the Royal Armouries. Steel is Kirby's favoured medium, allowing the sense of scale and dramatic impact found in Sutton Hoo Helmet. The sculpture is illustrative of Kirby's largely figural body of work, and its mask-like quality has been repeated in subsequent pieces. Background The Sutton Hoo helmet In 1939, archaeologists excavating barrows overlooking the River Deben near Woodbridge, Suffolk, discovered an Anglo-Saxon grave of unparalleled wealth. The Sutton Hoo ship-burial was quickly labelled \\"Britain's Tutankhamun\\"; the finds reshaped views of what was then termed the Dark Ages, which‚Äîwith new understandings of its wealth and sophistication‚Äîbecame known as the Middle Ages. The most iconic artefact, the Sutton Hoo helmet, was pieced together from more than 500 fragments. In the decades since, the Sutton Hoo helmet has come to symbolise the Middle Ages, archaeology, and England. Bath, showing the maquette for Sutton Hoo Helmet The Sutton Hoo finds were donated to the British Museum within weeks. The estate was privately owned until 1998, when its 245 acres were bequeathed to the National Trust. In 2000 the Trust commissioned van Heyningen and Haward Architects to design a visitor centre. Their work included the overall planning of the estate, the design of an exhibition hall and visitor facilities, car park, and the restoration of the Edwardian house. The ¬£5million visitor centre (equivalent to ¬£million in ) was opened on 13 March 2002 by Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney, whose translation of Beowulf, an Anglo- Saxon epic poem that describes extravagant burial customs similar to those observed at Sutton Hoo, had been published in 1999. The National Trust commissioned the English sculptor Rick Kirby to create a work for the visitor centre. He was tasked with making something with a \\"fierce presence\\". Kirby's works then included several public commissions, among them a sculpture outside St Thomas' Hospital, unveiled by Princess Margaret in 2000, and another in the Calne town centre, announced by Queen Elizabeth in 2001. The National Trust Sutton Hoo Helmet was winched into place above the entrance of the exhibition hall on 26 February 2002, ahead of its official unveiling in March. The sculpture remained above the doors, dominating the entrance, until 2019; on 30 May it was installed in a new location at the entrance. In the course of making the sculpture, Kirby completed a mock-up, or maquette. The maquette, high with pedestal, was offered for sale by a private art gallery in 2005, with an asking price of ¬£9,600. Description The sculpture from below Kirby's sculpture is based on the famous helmet found in the Sutton Hoo ship- burial, but is rendered on a much larger scale. It is made from of mild steel plates that have been coloured red, and is high, wide, and deep. The external structure rests on an internal steel frame. By contrast, the actual helmet is high, wide, deep, and originally weighed an estimated . Like the fragmented Anglo-Saxon helmet, Kirby's work is made of many pieces of metal, evoking an object reconstructed by an archaeologist. The sculpture intentionally emulates the fragmentary appearance of the helmet's second reconstruction, reassembled from 1970 to 1971 by Nigel Williams, rather than the glistening replica made by the Royal Armouries. Sutton Hoo Helmet was described by the National Trust as \\"fantastic‚Äîsuch a striking image and it has a real wow factor\\", and by the East Anglian Daily Times as an \\"iconic\\" sculpture greeting visitors to the site. Both the material and the subject are typical of Kirby's work. Steel is Kirby's material of choice, for what he describes as \\"the ability to go huge\\" and its \\"whoom-factor!\\" Much of Kirby's other work focuses on the human face and form, and his later pieces Masks and Vertical Face repeat the same staring, unemotive quality.

It attracts up to 100,000 people. The festival is managed and produced by the non-profit Creative Capital Arts Trust and held each year over a weekend in late March, the festival comprises a dozen music stages, parade groups, street theatre performances, visual art installations, and food and beverage vendors. Some central city streets are closed with Cuba Street in the centre, creating a large pedestrian festival zone. Many artists participate in the programme and CubaDupa includes acts from all over the world.  History  CubaDupa is a revival of the Cuba Street Carnival which ran from 1998- 2009. CubaDupa was founded in 2015 from a vision between the newly formed Creative Capital Arts Trust and the Wellington City Council. Drew James was the Artistic Director from 2015 - 2019. In 2020 Gerry Paul was the festival director, and Drew James remained as a creative consultant. The Creative Capital Arts Trust is also the umbrella for the New Zealand Fringe Festival.  Festivals  Some of the events of the 2015 festival were 100 Brazilian samba drummers hosted by Wellington Batucada and The Grand Opening tours of the Opera House produced by Barbarian Productions as well as stages with bands. The new brand for CubaDupa was a finalist in the 2015 Designers Institute of New Zealand, Best Design Awards in the Small Brand Identity category. In 2017 the CubaDupa festival was reported as having 250 events from Samba performances, opera, dance, steampunks, and virtual reality tours and 90 street food stalls. The 2019 programme included Cha Wa from New Orleans, Alien Weaponry and New Zealand dance company Touch Compass. The programme and locations were changed to create a more security-focused event after the Christchurch Terror Attacks just prior on the 15 March. The COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand forced the cancellation of the 2020 festival with the desion made very close to the event. There were 1500 artists and 450 performances lined up. A live streaming event occurred on Saturday 18 April.

Insulin resistant individuals can maintain normal responses to blood glucose due to the fact that higher levels of insulin are secreted as long as the beta cells of the pancreas are able to increase their output of insulin to compensate for the insulin resistance. But the ratio of the incremental increase in plasma insulin associated with an incremental increase in plasma glucose (disposition index) provides a better measure of beta cell function than the plasma insulin response to a glucose challenge. Loss of function of the beta cells, reducing their capacity to compensate for insulin resistance, results in a lower disposition index. Disposition index is used as a measure of beta cell function and the ability of the body to dispose of a glucose load. Thus a lowering of disposition index predicts the conversion of insulin resistance to diabetes mellitus type 2. Disposition index, but not insulin resistance, can predict type 2 diabetes in persons with normal blood glucose levels, but who do not have a family history (genetic predisposition) to type 2 diabetes. Disposition index can be increased by aerobic exercise, but only to the extent that insulin sensitivity is improved.

Rucker by C. M. Bell Studio Henry A. Rucker seated at large desk in his office Henry Allen Rucker (November 14, 1852‚ÄîMay 11, 1924) was an African American entrepreneur and politician. Born into slavery, he was appointed to the powerful position of head of revenue collection in Georgia during Reconstruction. He was collector from 1897 until 1911. His tenure, three times longer than any white collector, allowed him to become a powerful political boss in the Republican Party. Despite serving at the nadir of race relations in Atlanta, Rucker was one of the three most powerful black politicians in Georgia, alongside Judson Whitlocke Lyons and John H. Deveaux, characterized as the \\"big three\\" by rival Benjamin Jefferson Davis. Early life Rucker was born on November 14, 1852 in Washington, Georgia. He was a slave of Dr. William King and the seventh of fourteen children. His father was a plasterer for Dr. King and his mother, Betsey (Bessie) Rucker, had some autonomy as a slave. The family moved to Kensington, Georgia after the owner died. She supervised the children and invalid husband and moved the family to Atlanta after the Civil War. Henry Rucker was educated at Storrs School and worked a series of odd jobs before purchasing a house and a barber shop. He continued his studies at the Storrs Night School and Atlanta University Academy. After dropping out as a sophomore, Rucker joined Jackson McHenry in one of Atlanta's black militia companies in the 1870s. Rucker taught in Atlanta public schools before entering politics in 1880. Political career Rucker worked for the federal government in several positions, including storekeeper, route agent, deputy collector, and liquor gauger. His barbershop became a haven for white politicians, and he advised them on who could fill certain positions. From his business activity came enough capital to secure leadership in the Georgia Real Estate Loan and Trust Company. Rucker supported black liquor opportunities and opposed prohibition. By 1880, he was appointed a delegate to the Republican National Convention. He and several of his colleagues in the educated black middle class began pressing the federal government for more patronage positions for African Americans, since they formed the majority of the Republican base in Georgia. Even though the white Republican Party had split off for several years, Rucker and other black leaders pushed for African American concerns before a reconciliation between the two halves of the party. He supported a memorandum that improved streets in black neighborhoods and increased public school enrollment. President Grover Cleveland dismissed Rucker as federal clerk in the 1880s and again in 1893, but he was quickly becoming an important player in Georgia politics. Rucker was a delegate at the 1896 Republican National Convention and was a vocal supporter of William McKinley, since he was, according to Rucker, in favor of \\"free and well-paid labor in the South\\" and \\"provided the colored man with an incentive to work and ameliorate his condition.\\" In 1897, the banker James W. English recommended Rucker for the head of revenue collection despite protests from some whites who wanted to end patronage positions for blacks. McKinley appointed him to the position with an annual income of $4500. As head of revenue collection, Rucker gained access to the structure of a political process that encouraged personal privilege. He helped T. A. Jackson become principal of the Mitchell Street School and appointed two black men to Internal Revenue positions vacated by whites in protest of his nomination. In 1889, Rucker fired a black elevator conductor for abusing his role, frequently jerking the lever and insulting the clientele. Rucker Building (1979) In office, Rucker largely sought to maintain cordial relations with white business leaders such as the Augusta Brewing Company and tightly control newspaper accounts of his activities. This is exemplified by a 1904 article in the Atlanta Independent that characterized him as a \\"Model Citizen\\" who was \\"a Rich Heritage to the Race\\" due to earning respectability. His commitment to \\"good citizenship\\" came from a reputation as an \\"efficient and faithful [public] official with an \\"unsurpassable record.\\" However, there were also negative political cartoons of Rocker in other papers. Despite being an important machine politician, his power was constrained by segregation, larger and more powerful white groups, and disfranchisement of blacks, forcing him to sometimes work with Democrats. In April 1904, Benjamin Jefferson Davis challenged Rucker's leadership, arguing that in order for Georgia Republicans to produce \\"a respectable vote\\" for Theodore Roosevelt, new leaders needed to be brought in to mobilize the party. Nonetheless, Rucker was able to maintain support and controlled the state convention in 1904 enough to pass Judson Lyons reappointment with no resistance from the white Republican faction. In 1906, he initiated construction of the Rucker Building on Auburn Avenue, which became a central feature of the black central business district in Atlanta. Rucker continued to serve as collector until 1911. By the time of his death in 1924, he was one of the wealthiest blacks in America.

He served in the Department of State for forty years and held diplomatic posts in Canada, Latin America, Europe, and Asia throughout his career. Early life and education Clare Timberlake was born in Jackson, Michigan on October 29, 1907, the son of Wilbur and Dorothy. He studied at the University of Michigan, before studying law at Harvard. He eventually earned a master's degree from George Washington University. Diplomatic career Timberlake joined the United States Foreign Service in 1930 after leaving Harvard University and was posted first to the U.S. consulate in Toronto, Ontario, Canada as vice consul. He remained in this posting for one year, before being assigned as vice consul in Buenos Aires, Argentina. After leaving Argentina, he served as third secretary in Uruguay, and Zurich. Hayes was serving in Spain during the Spanish Civil War in the northwestern city of Vigo until 1940. After brief postings in Aden and French Somaliland he returned to Washington and headed the State Department's Division of African Affairs. In 1948, Hayes became U.S. consul in Bombay. He would later become Consul General in Hamburg and Deputy Chief of Mission in Bonn in the 1950s. In 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Timberlake to the position of first U.S. Ambassador to the newly independent Democratic Republic of the Congo, a former Belgian colony. During the Congo Crisis, Hayes was a vocal supporter of Mobutu Sese Seko, and advocated the deposition of Patrice Lumumba. In March 1961, Hayes personally ordered five U.S. Navy vessels into the waters off the Congo, a move that caught the Kennedy administration off guard. In 1961, Timberlake's stint in the Congo came to an end after President Kennedy recalled him from Leopoldville as he was viewed as a relic of Eisenhower-era policy. He was sent to Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama to serve as State Department liaison officer, a position viewed as a demotion. He later chaired the advisory committee of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and then became U.S. permanent representative to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva. After serving on the Foreign Service Board of Examiners, Hayes retired in 1970. Later life and death Timberlake was president of the Greater Washington Chapter of the Leukemia Society of America from 1971 to 1974.

His significant diplomatic achievements during the First Carlist War earned him the Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic, as well as the Order of Charles III. Early years left Lecubarri was born in London into an ancient Spanish noble House, son of the Franco-Spanish Hussar cavalry officer Manuel de Lecubarri y Uraga and Manuela Gorostiza y Egusqueaguirre. He returned to Spain briefly following his birth to be baptised through the Catholic Church 2 August 1802, at the Church of Saint Vincent near Bilbao.Baptism certificate. Reference code: ES/AHEB-BEHA/F006.038 (0272/001-00) His father, grandson of the navy officer Juan Nepomuceno de Lecubarri and descendant of the House of Poitiers, educated him with tutors until 1813, when he enrolled at Stonyhurst and later Eton College in 1815. As expressed by him in letters, he loathed his time at school and felt alienated by his Roman Catholic background. Jos√© Agust√≠n de Lecubarri was brought up in a wealthy family, which allowed him to read Ancient history at Oriel College, Oxford until 1824, year in which he returned to Spain to enter the Navy. His military career began on 4 September 1824 as Midshipman, rising to Frigate Ensign in June 1825 aboard the frigate Aretusa, thereafter promoted to captain of said frigate in January 1828. Such actions as captain earned him the Cross to Naval Merit. Diplomatic career In 1833, he left the Navy to devote himself to diplomacy. Back in London he joins as Consul General of Spain to the United Kingdom, being the youngest in history to hold such office. Lecubarri and the ambassador, Juan Nepomuceno Vial, managed to consolidate an exceptional relationship with mutually supportive policies, which would serve as a breeding ground for the sending of troops by the British Government in the First Carlist War. The British Auxiliary Legion became a determining factor in the course of the war.Estado Mayor de la Armada espa√±ola.

His services to the crown during the beginning of the First Carlist War earned him the cross of the Order of Charles III. Subsequently, and as a reward for his encouragement of favourable relations and cooperation between Spain and his country of birth, the queen Isabela II imposed him the Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic in 1847.

It has been the site of hydrocarbon exploration since the 1960s, with many significant oil and gas discoveries, including the Clair oilfield, which had an estimated 8 billion barrels of oil in place before production started,https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/news-and-insights/press- releases/new-clair-ridge-jackets-safely-installed-west-of-shetland.html the Schiehallion oilfield and the Lancaster oilfield. Geometry The Faroe- Shetland Basin is a SW-NE trending rift basin that is divided into several sub-basins with intervening ridges and highs. The geometry is less clear on the northwestern side of the basin due to the presence of thick Late Paleocene flood basalts. Even where the lavas are absent the development of large sill complexes makes seismic imaging at deeper levels difficult. Tectonic development The first period of rifting identified in the area was during the Devonian as part of the development of the Orcadian Basin. Rocks of this age are known from parts of the Rona Ridge and the Corona Ridge. Rifting appears to have continued into the Carboniferous with rocks of this age also locally preserved above the Devonian. During the Permian to Triassic periods thick sequences of continental deposits were formed in a series of basins, such as the Papa Basin. The main period of rifting started during the Middle Jurassic, continuing into the Late Jurassic and possibly later. It was at this time that the Faroe-Shetland Basin took in its current shape. There was a further episode of rifting during the Late Cretaceous to Paleocene that locally modified the existing basins and formed new depocentres such as the Foinaven Sub-basin. At the end of the Paleocene, the area was affected by magmatism, part of the North Atlantic Igneous Province and a short-lived phase of uplift. The final phase of tectonics was localised inversion during the Eocene to Miocene that generated major anticlines. Hydrocarbon exploration Hydrocarbons have been discovered in reservoirs of Archean, Devonian, Carboniferous, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Paleocene and Eocene age in a mixture of structural and stratigraphic traps.

Williams (March 18, 1928 ‚Äì December 27, 2012), known primarily as Dr. Sid, was a chiropractor most well known for establishing the largest single-campus chiropractic school, Life University. Williams was also president of the International Chiropractors Association, serving as its seventh president from 1982 to 1985, and was an instrumental figure in the creation of Life Chiropractic College West. Williams is also well known for being a star football player during his college career at Georgia Tech, where he started as a defensive left end from 1950 to 1952. Highlights of his football career include winning the 1952 Orange Bowl, and his subsequent election to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets Hall of Fame. Early life Sid Williams was born on March 18, 1928, in Rome, Georgia. He attended Tech High School in Atlanta, Georgia and while there earned the rank of Eagle Scout, and joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps where he served as a Lieutenant Colonel and captain of the drill and rifle team. During his sophomore year at high school, Williams also joined the football team as a quarterback, and was starting for the team after only three weeks of fall practice. In 1946, Williams graduated from high school and by 1947 joined the 179th Field Artillery unit, 22nd Infantry Division, in the Georgia Army National Guard. He served for a period of one year, and advanced to the rank of second lieutenant. Following his military service, in 1948, Williams fielded scholarships from over ten different colleges before settling on his parents' Alma mater, Georgia Tech. While at Georgia Tech, Williams began as a 4th string left back before being promoted to the varsity squad in his second year of school. For the 1950 and 1952 seasons, Williams started as defensive left end, and he played in the 1952 Orange Bowl where Georgia Tech beat Baylor University with a fourth quarter field goal. His coach, Bobby Dodd, at one time explained Williams by stating, \\"For his size, Sid Williams is the best end in America. Sid is very clever, can move well and hits as hard as any defensive end I have ever seen ... There is no way to overestimate his defensive value to our team.\\" During Williams' last year of college football he sustained many injuries, and was amazed at the care he received from a local chiropractor in Atlanta. Following his chiropractic experience, Williams decided to quit the pursuit of his master's degree in Labor Relations and attend Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa. He and his newly- wedded wife, Nell Kimbrough, decided to both attend Palmer for the four years following their education at Georgia Tech. Chiropractic Upon graduating from Palmer College of Chiropractic, in 1956 Drs. Sid and Nell Williams moved to Austell, Georgia where they set up their first chiropractic office. Within a few years the pair had opened up and were running more than 18 clinics in the Atlanta metro area. On Tuesday nights, Williams would invite individuals from the community to attend what he called \\"Dynamic Essentials\\" (DE) meetings. These meetings would cover the philosophy and use of chiropractic care in day-to-day life, and would be a staple of the chiropractic profession for the rest of Williams' life. Williams, by then a member of the International Chiropractors Association (ICA), and wanting to do more for the profession, began a 501(c)(3) organization called the Life Foundation International. Around the same time, he began publishing a chiropractic magazine named Today's Chiropractic which became an international publication and the platform Williams used to voice his beliefs and philosophy about chiropractic. In 1982, Williams was elected as the president of the ICA, and served in this position until 1985. Following his service as president he resided as ICA Chairman of the Board, and as Chair of ICA‚Äôs Legislative Committee. Due to his contributions to chiropractic and the ICA, Williams was awarded with the Chiropractor of the Year award from the ICA in 1985. =Life University= In 1974, Sid and Nell Williams founded Life Chiropractic College in Marietta, Georgia. During one of their summer Life DE meetings, the Williams' raised over 500 thousand dollars ( dollars) to fund the program. The campus was originally leased from the Lockheed Corporation, and on January 20, 1975, Life Chiropractic College opened with a pioneer class of 22 students. During his tenure, Williams grew the school's total enrollment to over 3,500 students, making it the largest chiropractic college in the world at the time. Much of this increase was due to William's aggressive advertising campaign in the Atlanta area, which included running commercials for the school on television while the Atlanta Braves were being broadcast. Williams also was determined to field a nationally winning basketball team and hired Roger Kaiser to coach at Life. The team, a member of the NAIA, went on to win three national championships while Williams was president ‚Äî one in 1997, 1999, and 2000. Williams was also a key figure in the creation of Life Chiropractic College West, in Hayward, California. This college, founded as Pacific States Chiropractic College in 1976, quickly was faced with multiple malfeasance cases and as a result went through a turnover of presidents at a quick rate. In 1981, Williams, along with two other doctors, agreed to merge Pacific States with Life Chiropractic College to create what is now colloquially known as Life West. In 2002, due to issues surrounding Life's accreditation with the Council on Chiropractic Education, Williams was forced to retire. Over fifty areas for improvement were cited for the loss of accreditation, most of them stemming from differences between the agency and Williams' own philosophy. One year after his retirement the school regained its accreditation status. Personal life Williams married Nell Kimbrough on March 21, 1953. Together they had two children, Kim and John. In 1995, the Georgia Council of Chiropractic awarded Williams with the distinction of \\"Chiropractor of the Century\\" for all his positive work towards the profession. On December 24, 2011, Williams suffered from a stroke in middle cerebral artery which took him out of the public spotlight. He battled with recovery for one year before dying due to complications of pneumonia on December 27, 2012, in Powder Springs, Georgia.

She is currently teaching at the University of Connecticut since 1990.  Career  Anne Berthelot is an since 1980, and a graduate of the √âcole normale sup√©rieure. She obtained the from Paris-Sorbonne University in 1982, with her dissertation entitled . Then she pursued a Doctor of Letters at Paris-Sorbonne University in 1987, with the research work under the direction of the Romanist and Medievalist . She is a specialist in the prose romances of the 13th century, she is particularly interested in the problems of enunciation and specialises in Arthurian Literature with a comparative approach, she has written numerous books and articles on these subjects. She helped to edit the Lancelot-Graal and prepared a study of Merlin in the literature of England, France and Germany from the 12th to the 15th centuries.  The historical origins of the Arthurian legend are lost in the mists of time: Roman Britain, Sarmatians, Picts or the Saxon kings? Who were Arthur's contemporaries? Archaeological findings in Wales, Cornwall and Scotland suggest the possible existence of this legendary figure. Arthurian legend is central to Anglo-Saxon culture, and by the 12th century King Arthur and his kingdom had become a national myth, elaborated by English and French writers. It owes its existence in literature to an Anglo-French rivalry: Henry II of England, for establishing his legitimacy, had the story of an Anglo- Saxon hero written that was destined to be a counterpart to Charlemagne. Thus was born the legend of Arthur. During the Middle Ages, Arthur became the absolute model of a knight, herald of courtly values and defender of Christendom. Between myth and history, Anne Berthelot manages to unravel the threads of this great legend in a small but lavishly illustrated volume‚Äî (lit. 'Arthur and the Round Table: The Power of a Legend'; UK edition ‚Äì King Arthur: Chivalry and Legend; US edition ‚Äì King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table)‚Äîpublished by √âditions Gallimard as the 298th volume in their series for the \\"D√©couvertes\\" collection. The book contains a huge number of colour illustrations taken from medieval illuminated manuscripts, 16th and 19th- century engravings, Pre-Raphaelite paintings and other sources. It opens with a series of reproductions of Julia Margaret Cameron's photographic illustrations for Idylls of the King‚Äîa cycle of twelve narrative poems by Alfred Tennyson‚Äîwhich retells the legend of King Arthur. The body text is divided into five chapters: I, \\"The Historical Context\\" (); II, \\"The Creation of a Legend\\" (); III, \\"The Life of Arthur\\" (); IV, \\"Feudalism and Chivalry\\" (); V, \\"An Extraordinary Literary Flowering\\" (). The following \\"Documents\\" section in British edition‚Äîwhich is reformulated by Thames & Hudson‚Äîcontains a compilation of excerpts which is divided into six chapters: 1, Arthur in 12th- century literature; 2, Arthur in the Middle Ages; 3, The Round Table and the Holy Grail; 4, Arthur in the 19th and 20th centuries; 5, In the footsteps of King Arthur; 6, King Arthur in the cinema. The original French version has seven chapters in this section and the contents are slightly different. At the end of the book are further reading, list of illustrations and index.

It consists of a lengthy interview that Wenner carried out with former Beatle John Lennon in December 1970 and which was originally serialised in Rolling Stone in its issues dated 21 January and 4 February 1971. The interview was intended to promote Lennon's primal therapy-inspired album John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and reflects the singer's emotions and mindset after undergoing an intense course of the therapy under Arthur Janov. It also serves as a rebuttal to Paul McCartney's public announcement of the Beatles' break-up, in April 1970. Accompanied by his wife, Yoko Ono, Lennon aired his grievances to Wenner about the Beatles' career and the compromises the band made during their years of international fame. He makes cutting remarks about his former bandmates, particularly McCartney, as well as associates and friends such as George Martin, Mick Jagger and Derek Taylor, and about the group's business adversaries. Lennon portrays himself as a genius who has suffered for his art. He also states his disillusion with the philosophies and beliefs that guided the Beatles and their audience during the 1960s, and commits to a more politically radical agenda for the new decade. Although Wenner's decision to re-publish the interview was done without Lennon's consent, the book helped create an enduring image of Lennon as the working-class artist dedicated to truth and lack of artifice. While some commentators question its reliability, the interview became a highly influential piece of rock journalism. It also helped establish Rolling Stone as a commercially successful magazine. Background Rolling Stone had included a picture of John Lennon on the cover of its inaugural issue, dated 9 November 1967, and did so again a year later, when the magazine featured a photo of him and Yoko Ono naked, in support of the couple's controversial avant-garde album, Two Virgins. Jann Wenner, the magazine's editor, also supported Lennon when other counterculture publications were critical of his and the Beatles' pacifist stance in reaction to the politically turbulent events of 1968. In May 1970, a month after Paul McCartney had announced the Beatles' break-up, Rolling Stone published Lennon's response, in which he depicted McCartney as taking credit for the situation when in fact he, George Harrison and Ringo Starr had each left the band on occasion. At this time, with Lennon and Ono in California to continue their primal therapy treatment under Arthur Janov, Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Wenner had wanted to carry out an in-depth interview with Lennon for Rolling Stone. Instead, Lennon and Ono undertook four months of therapy with Janov and then returned to London to record their respective albums John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band ‚Äì Lennon's first collection of songs outside the Beatles ‚Äì and Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band. Wenner was finally able to interview Lennon in late 1970, when he and Ono were in New York City visiting friends and filming Up Your Legs Forever and Fly with avant-garde film-maker Jonas Mekas. The interview took place on 8 December in the boardroom of Allen Klein's company ABKCO, at 1500 Broadway, and was intended to promote John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. Lennon was accompanied by Ono, and Wenner taped the proceedings. Lennon had arranged to meet with McCartney while they were both in New York, in order to discuss their differences regarding the Beatles' company Apple Corps, but McCartney cancelled the meeting. Lennon said that he was planning on not showing up anyway. Since making his announcement in April, McCartney had told London's Evening Standard newspaper that he wanted to leave the Beatles' record label, Apple Records, and reiterated his opposition to Klein's appointment as the band's business manager. With no further explanation on the break-up, media speculation had instead focused on the possibility of the band members solving their differences and reuniting. Interview content Lennon discussed the Beatles' history, giving details that were little known beforehand. Among these was the first public confirmation of Brian Epstein's homosexuality. According to author Peter Doggett, the interview represents a piece of concept art that matches the raw emotional content of Lennon's Plastic Ono Band album. As with Lennon's new music, it reflected the principles of primal therapy in its engagement with, and rejection of, the past and associated emotional pain. =Inauthenticity of the Beatles= Lennon begins by saying that Plastic Ono Band is \\"the best thing I've ever done\\". He states his satisfaction with tracks such as \\"Mother\\", for its sparse sound and unadorned arrangement; \\"Working Class Hero\\", as \\"a song for the revolution\\"; and \\"God\\", in which he disavows his former beliefs and \\"myths\\", including the Beatles, before announcing that \\"The dream is over\\". He tells Wenner: \\"I'm not just talking about the Beatles, I'm talking about the generation thing. It's over, and we gotta ‚Äì I have to personally ‚Äì get down to so-called reality.\\" By comparison, Lennon denigrates most of the Beatles' work as dishonest. He highlights his compositions \\"Help!\\", \\"In My Life\\", \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"Across the Universe\\" as examples of the \\"truth\\" he brought to the band's music. He says that, with Ono's influence, his songs on the White Album represent a sustained study in first-person narrative and therefore authenticity in his art. When asked about his former bandmates' recent solo releases, he describes McCartney's self-titled album as \\"rubbish\\" and says that Plastic Ono Band will most likely \\"scare him into doing something decent\\". Lennon says he prefers Harrison's All Things Must Pass to McCartney, but qualifies the comment by saying: \\"Personally, at home, I wouldn't play that kind of music ... I don't want to hurt George's feelings, I don't know what to say about it.\\" He similarly describes Starr's Beaucoups of Blues as \\"good\\" but says: \\"I wouldn't buy it, you know ... I didn't feel as embarrassed as I did about his first record [Sentimental Journey].\\" He identifies himself as a \\"genius\\" whose talents were overlooked or ignored since childhood, by school teachers and by the aunt, Mimi Smith, who brought him up following the death of his mother. According to Lennon, this genius was similarly belittled or compromised by the expectations of fans and music critics, who favoured the conformist, \\"Engelbert Humperdinck\\" side of the Beatles, as represented by McCartney. When discussing the Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney songwriting partnership, Lennon identifies himself as the artist and truth-teller, and McCartney as a commercially focused tunesmith. He complains that, as an artist, having to play the part of a Beatle was \\"torture\\", adding: \\"I resent performing for fucking idiots who don't know anything. They can't feel ... They live vicariously through me and other artists ...\\" He denigrates the band's US fans at the height of Beatlemania, saying that American youth in 1964 displayed a clean-cut, wholesome appearance yet represented an \\"ugly race\\". Regarding rock critics, he states: \\"What do I have to do to prove to you son-of-a-bitches what I can do, and who I am? Don't dare, don't you dare fuckin' dare criticize my work like that. You, who don't know anything about it. Fuckin' bullshit!\\" Lennon says that the Beatles' image was sanitised by their agreeing to Epstein's requirement that they wear suits and curb the riotous behaviour that had been a feature of the group's stage shows in Hamburg in the early 1960s. He says that with their international fame, the band's existence became a constant humiliation in which they were denied the freedom to speak out about global issues and their artistic integrity was lost. He dismisses the 1968 book The Beatles ‚Äì the band's authorised biography written by Hunter Davies ‚Äì as a further example of their image being whitewashed for the public. Lennon says that he himself allowed his Aunt Mimi to remove the \\"truth bits\\" about his childhood in Liverpool, but that Davies omitted any mention of drug-taking or the \\"orgies\\" taking place during the Beatles' concert tours. Lennon likens these backstage and hotel parties to the debauchery depicted in Frederico Fellini's film Satyricon. He blames the Beatles' audience for idolising the false image and reinforcing the myth surrounding the band. =LSD, Maharishi and primal therapy= Lennon discusses his consumption of hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD, saying that he and Harrison were the most adventurous with the drug, and claiming that he himself had taken \\"a thousand trips\\". He agrees with Ono that LSD and his subsequent absorption in meditation under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi were \\"mirrors\\" to his own identity. Lennon recounts his and Harrison's final meeting with the Maharishi before the pair left his ashram in India. Lennon says that Janov's primal therapy is another \\"mirror\\", but it has freed him from his natural introspection. =McCartney and Beatles associates= Amid his complaints about the Beatles, Lennon especially targets McCartney. He says that after Epstein's death in 1967, McCartney assumed a leadership role, but it took the band \\"in circles\\". He characterises McCartney as controlling and self-interested, saying that McCartney treated himself and Harrison as sidemen. Lennon identifies Let it Be as a project \\"by Paul for Paul\\", in which scenes featuring Lennon and Ono were excised to show McCartney as a more powerful force. Lennon heavily criticises his bandmates for their coldness towards Ono and their failure to recognise her as a creative equal. He says that while Starr was more accepting, he could never forgive Harrison and McCartney for their dismissal of Ono. He attributes the couple's descent into heroin addiction to the disapproval they received from the Beatles and those close to the band. Lennon dismisses producer George Martin's contribution to the Beatles' music, saying that Martin was merely a \\"translator\\". He pairs Martin with the Beatles' former music publisher, Dick James, as two associates who took credit for the band's success when in fact it was only the four Beatles who were responsible. Lennon says: \\"I'd like to hear Dick James' music and I'd like to hear George Martin's music, please, just play me some ... People are under a delusion that they made us, when in fact we made them.\\" He then attacks the Beatles' long-serving aides Peter Brown, Derek Taylor and Neil Aspinall as having believed they too were part of the Beatles. According to Lennon, these individuals represented a false illusion among the staff at Apple, whereby the Beatles provided a \\"portable Rome\\" in which Brown, Taylor and Aspinall felt entitled to a position beside \\"the Caesars\\". Lennon portrays Klein as the saviour of the Beatles' finances against entrepreneurs such as Lew Grade and Dick James. He says that Klein brought a working-class honesty to their business dealings and that this contrasted with the snobbishness of Lee Eastman, who was McCartney's choice over Klein. In Lennon's description, by siding with Eastman, McCartney had adopted a business stance that said: \\"I'm going to drag my feet and try and fuck you.\\" Lennon also says that he left the Beatles in September 1969 but acquiesced to McCartney and Klein's urging that his departure be kept private, for business reasons, yet McCartney then turned his own departure into a public \\"event\\" in order to promote his first solo album. =Rock music, art and politics= He identifies 1950s rock 'n' roll and his latest work as the only valid form of rock music. He criticises the Rolling Stones for slavishly copying the Beatles, and questions the Stones' reputation as a more political and \\"revolutionary\\" group than the Beatles. Lennon attacks Mick Jagger personally, saying that, as the Stones' singer and frontman, he \\"resurrected 'bullshit movement,' wiggling your arse\\" and \\"fag dancing\\". He says that Bob Dylan's adoption of a pseudonym was a \\"bullshit\\" affectation, and dismisses Dylan's recently released New Morning as an album that \\"doesn't mean a fucking thing\\". By comparison, he views Ono's work as more interesting than Dylan and McCartney combined. He expresses his gratitude to Ono for introducing him to the conceptual art of Marcel Duchamp. Lennon states his allegiance to New Left politics and support for the avant-garde. Publication=Serialisation in Rolling Stone= Rolling Stone published the interview in two parts, in its issues dated 21 January 1971 and 4 February 1971. Wenner allowed Lennon to edit the transcripts before publication. At 30,000 words, the interview was considerably longer than the standard feature on a rock or pop artist. Both issues of the magazine featured Lennon on the cover, with photos taken by Annie Leibovitz. The first part was subtitled \\"The Working Class Hero\\" and the second, \\"Life with the Lions\\", which was the title of Lennon and Ono's 1969 experimental album. For Beatles fans, the content of the interview furthered the distasteful atmosphere surrounding the group's demise. Its publication followed the announcement, on 31 December 1970, that McCartney had launched an action against Lennon, Harrison and Starr in the London High Court of Justice, in an effort to extricate himself from Klein and all contractual obligations to Apple. The two issues sold out immediately. The interview elevated Rolling Stone to its most prominent position yet in the US and established the magazine as an international title. Time magazine dubbed the combination of McCartney's lawsuit and Lennon's interview \\"Beatled√§mmerung\\", in reference to Wagner's opera about a war among the gods. =Book format= In April 1971, Wenner travelled to the UK to discuss with Lennon the possibility of publishing the interview in book form. Lennon was away in Spain but later left a message for Wenner saying that the interview was not to be re-published and that Wenner was \\"jumpin' da gun\\" by discussing the idea with a book publisher. Wenner nevertheless pursued the opportunity and received $40,000 for his book deal. Ono later said that Wenner had placed money before friendship; Wenner agreed, and described it as \\"one of the biggest mistakes I made\\". Lennon was incensed and never spoke to Wenner again. Titled Lennon Remembers, the book was published by Straight Arrow in the autumn of 1971. By this time, Lennon had rejected Janov and, with Ono, had adopted a new philosophy, focused on political radicalism with New Left figures such as Jerry Rubin. In response to Wenner's invitation that they meet and discuss the book's publication, Lennon wrote him a letter, in late November, in which he said that he had only agreed to give Wenner the interview to help turn around the business difficulties that Rolling Stone was facing in 1970, and that Wenner had acted illegally. Lennon challenged Wenner to print the letter in Rolling Stone, \\"then we'll talk.\\" Lennon took to calling the book \\"Lennon Regrets\\". In retaliation at Wenner, Apple temporarily withdrew its advertising from Rolling Stone. In early 1972, Lennon and Ono began contributing to a new San Francisco-based political and cultural magazine, SunDance, in an attempt to sabotage Wenner's commercial standing. Lennon Remembers was re-released in 2000 by Verso Books. For this edition, it contained the full two-part interview along with text that had been omitted from the initial publication. In his introduction, Wenner writes that the 1970 Lennon interview represented \\"the first time that any of the Beatles, let alone the man who had founded the group and was their leader, finally stepped outside of that protected, beloved fairy tale and told the truth ... He was bursting and bitter about the sugarcoated mythology of the Beatles and Paul McCartney's characterization of the breakup.\\" =Audio= In the years following publication in 1971, segments of the recorded interview were broadcast on radio in the US. The most extensive airing was on The Lost Lennon Tapes, a series presented by Elliot Mintz and broadcast on Westwood One between January 1988 and March 1992. Some of Lennon's complaints about the Beatles' business acquaintances were edited out for the program. In the UK, the interview was broadcast in full for the first time in December 2005. The following year, Rolling Stone made the audio available as a podcast on its website. Personal reactions and criticism Lennon's comments were applauded by members of the New Left and ensured that he and Ono became figureheads for the cause. By contrast, William F. Buckley Jr., an arch-conservative journalist, wrote a highly critical editorial about the interview in his magazine National Review. Buckley criticised Lennon for revelling in egotism, and for his derision of those who had failed to venerate him in the past. Buckley also wrote: \\"It is remarkable to achieve in combination what Mr. Lennon manages to do here, namely a) to demonstrate how he laid waste his life during the 1960s, and b) to proclaim so apodictically on how others should govern their lives: (recipe: adore Lennon, and (favourite verb ['fuck']) your neighbor).\\" Writing in the lay Catholic Commonweal in September 1972, Todd Gitlin welcomed Lennon's forthrightness. He said that, in debunking the Beatles and 1960s counterculture, Lennon \\"revives the idea of leader as exemplar\\" and had provided a new direction for \\"the movement\\". Hunter Davies said that shortly after reading the Rolling Stone interview, he phoned Lennon to complain about his disparagement of the 1968 Beatles biography. According to Davies, Lennon offered an apology and said: \\"You know me, Hunt. I just say anything.\\" In an interview with Doggett, Derek Taylor refuted Lennon's assertion of him and Aspinall, saying that they had both always respected the boundaries between themselves and the Beatles, and were feeling disconsolate enough with the failure of Apple. Taylor added: \\"John later retracted some of it, and we became friends again ... He would forget he'd said [something], and expect to be forgiven, as he always was.\\" George Martin was infuriated and recalled challenging Lennon on his comments in 1974: \\"He said, 'Oh Christ, I was stoned out of my fucking mind. You didn't take any notice of that, did you?' I said, 'Well, I did, and it hurt.'\\" In his first Rolling Stone interview, in late 1973, McCartney admitted he had been devastated by Lennon's statements about him. He recalled: \\"I sat down and pored over every little paragraph, every sentence ... And at the time I thought. 'It's me ... That's just what I'm like. He's captured me so well; I'm a turd.\\" McCartney responded by writing \\"Too Many People\\", in which, he told Playboy in 1984, he addressed Lennon's \\"preaching\\". After the song's release on McCartney's Ram album in May 1971, Lennon detected other examples of McCartney attacking him and responded with the song \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" The two former bandmates continued their public feud through the letters page of Melody Maker, with some of Lennon's correspondence requiring censorship by the magazine's editor. Janov reflected in 2000 that, with Lennon and Ono having left his care in August 1970 due to intervention from US immigration authorities, \\"They cut the therapy off just as it started, really.\\" Janov added: \\"We had opened him up, and we didn't have time to put him back together again.\\" Harrison said that, until Lennon entered his primal therapy period, \\"we didn't really realize the extent to which John was screwed up.\\" In a 1974 interview, Harrison criticised Wenner for publishing the book and for ignoring Lennon's claims that he no longer meant some of the things he had said. Combined with the uncompromising message of Lennon and Ono's political direction over 1971‚Äì72, the 1970 interview became the subject of parody. Released in December 1972, National Lampoon's Radio Dinner included the track \\"Magical Misery Tour\\" in which Tony Hendra parodied the primal therapy-inspired songwriting of Lennon. The lyrics of the song were taken entirely from Lennon Remembers and, as a closing refrain, highlighted Lennon's contention that \\"Genius is pain!\\" Legacy=Influence on Beatles historiography = Lennon's 1970 Rolling Stone interview became a key document in Beatles literature and, until the mid 1990s, was often viewed as the definitive statement on the Beatles' break-up. In its espousal of countercultural and New Left ideology, the interview also helped foster among rock journalists a more favourable view of Lennon than of McCartney, whose work as a solo artist, in line with Lennon's description of their respective approaches, was frequently ridiculed for its lack of profundity. The publication in book form aided these developments, in addition to Wenner continuing to present it as an accurate record of events, despite Lennon having contradicted or retracted some of his assertions in the years after the interview. Writing in her book The Beatles and the Historians, Erin Torkelson Weber recognises this as typical of a Beatles historiographical approach whereby the band's biographers allowed fact to be determined by \\"which side spoke loudest and gave the most interviews\\". Aware of his betrayal of Lennon's trust when he published Lennon Remembers, Wenner sought to make amends following the singer's fatal shooting in New York in December 1980. For the John Lennon commemorative issue of Rolling Stone, Wenner wrote an effusive feature article that lauded Lennon's achievements during and after the Beatles. Having renewed his friendship with Ono, Wenner also used the magazine to champion her work and to defend Lennon's legacy against author Albert Goldman's depiction in the controversial 1988 biography The Lives of John Lennon. McCartney believed that this commemorative issue, along with other posthumous tributes to Lennon, afforded his former bandmate a messiah-like status that served to diminish the importance of his own contribution to the Beatles. In his first major interview after Lennon's death, McCartney said, \\"if I could get John Lennon back I'd ask him to undo this legacy he's left me.\\" Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, McCartney sought to correct what he saw as a Lennon-biased revisionism to the Beatles' history, culminating in the 1997 publication of his authorised biography, Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now, by Barry Miles. In Torkelson Weber's view, Many Years from Now represents the \\"closest thing to a personal rebuttal of the Lennon Remembers interview\\" from any of Lennon's former bandmates. =Retrospective assessments= In his 2007 article on Lennon's Rolling Stone interview, for The Guardian, Hunter Davies wrote that the interview was revelatory at the time, and it remained \\"fascinating\\" because \\"all these years later, the Beatles grow bigger, better, all the time.\\" Davies acknowledged that it was \\"hardly a balanced account, even about himself\\" and that Lennon's disgust with the Beatles was mostly aimed inwards at his own compromises under Epstein's management, but the interview nevertheless presented Lennon in his element as a natural raconteur, with Wenner equally adept at bringing out Lennon's passion. In 2005, BBC Radio 4's John Lennon Season included a feature on the interview, using the original tapes and new commentary from Wenner and Ono. The BBC's writer described the 1970 interview as \\"seminal\\" and \\"the most famous interview\\" that Wenner had ever conducted for Rolling Stone, as well as \\"one of the most important ever done with a popular musician\\". Writing that same year in Uncut Legends: Lennon, Gavin Martin described it as \\"the most candid, electrifying, open and honest interview of his career, possibly in rock n roll history\\" in which Lennon \\"delivers the ultimate statement on Beatles excess, the scheming, corporate obscenity, the failure of the '60s revolution\\". Author and critic Tim Riley describes it as a \\"central part of rock lore\\" and \\"the venting every rock star would later claim for granted, even though nobody can hold forth like Lennon\\". Writing in the London Review of Books in 2000, Jeremy Harding said that Lennon's 1970 interview and the Plastic Ono Band album combined to \\"round off the 1960s nicely ‚Äì or nastily, come to that\\", with Lennon's rhetoric echoing the lyric from \\"God\\" that \\"The dream is over\\". He wrote that the \\"perplexing contradictions\\" manifested in the book \\"seem easier to grasp in retrospect ... rock and roll fundamentalism v. avant-gardism; therapy v. politics; and, above all for Lennon, John v. the Beatles and all they stood for\\". Harding added that this \\"self-engrossed, witty, malicious, foolish\\" Lennon of 1970 was also more appealing to a new generation of listeners than had been the case for the Beatles' contemporary fans.

Spicer (born 1962) is an American educator and politician from Framingham, Massachusetts. She was inaugurated on January 1, 2018 as the first Mayor of Framingham, becoming the first African-American woman to be popularly elected mayor in Massachusetts. She was previously the Vice President for Advocacy and Educational Partnerships at the Museum of Science in Boston, Massachusetts. Early life and education Yvonne Spicer grew up in Brooklyn, New York, the third of four children of Willie and Dorothy Spicer. When she was six years old, a visit to her class by Shirley Chisholm left a lasting impression of the importance of leadership and public service. Spicer's father died when she was ten. She was 13 years old when she got her first job running errands, peeling potatoes and stocking shelves for a Brooklyn restaurant, and her first official job was working for McDonald's. During the summers, she also helped her mother clean houses on the Upper East Side. Spicer attended Catholic middle school and graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School, then earned a B.S. in industrial arts & technology in 1984, followed by an M.S. in technology education in 1985, both from the State University of New York at Oswego, from which she was the first African-American woman to graduate. She earned her doctorate in Educational Leadership from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 2004. Career=Education= After graduating from college, Spicer moved to Framingham, Massachusetts in 1985 for a job as a woodworking instructor. She worked in the Framingham Public Schools for 16 years, also teaching drafting, architecture, graphic arts, and photography, and eventually becoming Chair of Technology Education, the first woman to fill that position. During that period she also worked part-time as a realtor. She spent two years as Statewide Technology and Engineering Coordinator at the Massachusetts Department of Education, then five years as Director of Career and Technical Education in the Newton Public Schools. In 2006, Spicer was hired as Associate Director of the Museum of Science (Boston)'s National Center for Technological Literacy, where she rose to Vice President for Advocacy and Educational Partnerships, a division she created and led. =Politics= Spicer served on the Framingham Human Relations Commission and the Democratic Town Committee. She was elected to Framingham's representative Town Meeting in 2016, where she served as vice-chair for Precinct 6, and on the Standing Committee on Ways and Means. Spicer was elected Framingham's first mayor in November 2017, following town's decision to change the format of the local government from a Board of Selectmen to a mayor and City Council. Senator Elizabeth Warren held the bible for Spicer's swearing in on January 1, 2018.

It was elevated to a town on October 1, 1928, and the town's name was officially changed to Kominato as part of the celebration of the enthronement of Emperor Hirohito. After the conclusion of the Pacific War, the point where the Morita River meets Mutsu Bay on the coast of Kominato was chosen by the Ministry of Transport as the site of a shipping port to Hakodate, Hokkaido to replace the port destroyed in Aomori City by air raids. Construction on a temporary port was completed on July 1, 1946, with services continuing until July 15, 1949. The services were cancelled because Japan National Railways assumed control of the port from the Ministry of Transport and then decided that the rebuilt port in Aomori would be more profitable than building a permanent port in Kominato. Despite losing the port's failure in turning Kominato into a transport hub, the town continued to make use the port in the scallop industry. On March 31, 1955, the town was merged with the neighboring Higashi-Hiranai and Nishi-Hiranai villages to make the currently extant town, Hiranai, with its government centered in Kominato. At the time of its merger, Kominato had a population of 9,790. Neighboring municipalities These were the neighboring municipalities of Kominato just before its incorporation into Hiranai.http://nrb-www.mlit.go.jp/webmapc/mapmain.html *Aomori ‚Äì this part of Aomori was the village, Azumadake until 1 January 1955. *Nonai ‚Äì now part of Aomori *Nishi-Hiranai ‚Äì now part of Hiranai *Higashi- Hiranai ‚Äì now part of Hiranai Economy The town once had a busy port, connecting the Japanese islands Honshu and Hokkaido to the north by ferry; however, the ferry services were moved to Aomori by the beginning of the 20th century. They returned to Kominato after 90 percent of Aomori was destroyed by American B-29 bombers during World War II; however, the services moved once again when Aomori recovered from the air raids. Otherwise, the town had a sizable paddy field system and was known for its scallops. Transportation *Matsumaed≈ç ‚Äì a sub-route of the ≈åsh≈´ Kaid≈ç; today it exists roughly along .

After its creation in 1952, Route 4 bypassed central Kominato, while the old Edo-era national road went through the center of the town.

The novel was published by Scribner. Plot In Flint City, Oklahoma, police detective Ralph Anderson arrests the popular English teacher and Little League coach, Terry Maitland, in front of a crowd of baseball spectators. Maitland is charged with the rape and mutilation of Frankie Peterson, an eleven-year-old boy. Maitland hires his friend and lawyer, Howie Gold, to assist him. However, Detective Anderson has eyewitness accounts and forensic evidence which clearly pinpoints Maitland as the main, and only, suspect. In the meantime, eager reporters harass Maitland's wife, Marcy and their two daughters, Sarah and Grace. The district attorney, Bill Samuels, urges Anderson to break Maitland's alibi in order to make this an open-and-shut case. Anderson discovers that multiple eyewitness accounts confirm Maitland was out of town, at a writer's conference in a neighboring town, when the murder was committed. Security footage from the conference also provides confirmation of Maitland's alibi. Anderson actually finds a book at the conference center gift shop that Maitland (or his doppelg√§nger) picked up and the fingerprints left on the book are confirmed to be Maitland's. Samuels encourages Anderson to destroy this new evidence, but Anderson doesn't. Despite evidence that shows that Maitland was in two places at once, Anderson still believes that Maitland killed the young boy. Maitland, who has been awaiting trial in jail is brought to the courthouse, where he is shot to death by the older victim's brother Ollie Peterson. Ollie is subsequently shot and killed by Detective Anderson. Anderson is then placed on administrative leave, and the district attorney decides not to seek re-election. With the help of the private investigator, Holly Gibney, Marcy Maitland and Howie Gold follow a trail of clues to Marysville, Texas. Detective Anderson, following the group, also heads to Texas. Jack Hoskins, Anderson's rival in local law enforcement, is coerced by the \\"Outsider\\" (i.e. the real killer) into killing Detective Anderson. The Outsider promises Hoskins that if he kills Anderson, he will be cured of his cancer. With the help of a number of characters, including police officers and a potential victim of the Outsider, both Anderson and Gibney discover that they have an actual monster on their hands. They set out to destroy the Outsider in a large cave in Marysville, where two children had died years earlier. Holly is able to hit the Outsider with a \\"happy slapper\\" (a sock filled with ball bearings, similar to the weapon that she used to stop Brady Hartsfield in King's novel, Mr. Mercedes). The Outsider appears to have been destroyed. Later, Samuels holds a press conference clearing Maitland, alleging defective DNA samples and confirming the conference center video proof supporting Maitland's alibi.

He was born on June 2, 1978, in Berlin, West Germany (now Germany). Erg√ºn-Hamaz is best known for his debut novel Kara G√ºnl√ºk: Die Geheimen Tageb√ºcher des Sesperado, published in Germany in 2010.

He has one older brother, Merih Erg√ºn, who was born in 1972 in BerlinErg√ºn-Hamaz, Mutlu. Personal interview. 26 January 2018. as well. Their father emigrated from West Anatolia in Turkey to Berlin in the 1960s as a gastarbeiter. He was interested in experiencing life in Germany but also in creating a better future for himself and his family. A few years later he brought his wife to Germany. He initially worked on construction sites, later as an interpreter and translator in public service. His wife worked as a cleaner, factory worker and finally as a kitchen help in a kindergarten. By moving to Germany they worked hard to build a new life, hoping for a better future for their children and supporting the extended family in Turkey. Initially they lived in Wedding (Berlin), which still is predominantly a working class and ethnically diverse area. Erg√ºn-Hamaz states about his early years: \\"I don't remember much of that time there, but I think I felt comfortable in kindergarten.\\" His father had worked for a few years in public service, when in the early 1980s the house they lived in burnt down (who or what started the fire remained inconclusive). They were then moved into a housing cooperative for people working in public service in Westend (Berlin). Their family was the only Turkish-German family in the area. Merih Erg√ºn, his brother, was a good student in Wedding, but after the move to Westend he struggled a lot in primary school which shaped his experience of the German education system significantly . Erg√ºn-Hamaz notes that he himself \\"was also singled out because of [his] Turkishness in kindergarten in Charlottenburg and some of the children would refuse to engage with [him]. [He] remember[s] from a very early age feeling out of place in Charlottenburg, even asking [his] mother if [he] was German or Turkish [...] which [he] didn't really understand as a child because [he] just felt or wanted to feel like everyone else around [him] and not different.\\" =Academic Background= In primary school, Erg√ºn-Hamaz was considered a mediocre student. He was not an angel in school, but mainly the students of color were branded as trouble-makers. During his secondary school years, Erg√ºn-Hamaz felt alienated and could tell that something was wrong in his country. As a child, Erg√ºn-Hamaz wanted to be a lawyer, but when he grew up he was more interested in writing and literature. For him educational sciences was a good combination of psychology and sociology, that is why he decided to study Education and Contemporary German Literature at the Free University Berlin.http://www.asta- bielefeld.de/CMS/fileadmin/user_upload/34/Kultur/fclr/Mutlu_Erguen_Presseinfo.pdf After finishing his studies, Erg√ºn-Hamaz moved to Great Britain in 2006. On the one hand to live with his partner Sofia Hamaz and on the other hand to start a master program in Race and Ethnic Relations at Birkbeck College, University of London. He finished his master studies in 2008 and began doing his PhD at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) in the Sociology Department a year later. Recently, he has been doing qualitative research on German anti-racism practitioners for his dissertation. =Main Ideas and Influences= Erg√ºn-Hamaz argues racism is still unconsciously prevalent in Western society.Doing Race. Wie werden Menschen zu ‚ÄûAnderen‚Äú gemacht?' In: Karim Fereidooni, Antonietta P. Zeoli (Ed.): Managing Diversity, Springer Verlag, Cham, Schweiz 2016, 29f. The society is based on White privilege to the disadvantage of People of Color. In order to undo racism, white people have to become aware of their racist attitude towards People of Color.Doing Race. Wie werden Menschen zu ‚ÄûAnderen‚Äú gemacht?' In: Karim Fereidooni, Antonietta P. Zeoli (Ed.): Managing Diversity, Springer Verlag, Cham, Schweiz 2016, 30. Erg√ºn-Hamaz is i. a. influenced by Whiteness studies, Postcolonialism, Orientalism, Black feminism and Black Panther Party. He applies their concepts to the situation of non-white German population. Also, contemporaries as Sybil Phoenix and Noah Sow (de) had a crucial impact on Erg√ºn-Hamaz. Erg√ºn-Hamaz gives an example for how children are inclined to develop an unconscious racism,Die (un-)sichtbaren Zusammenh√§nge des Wei√ü-Seins in der Kulturproduktion. In: Migrationsrat Berlin Brandenburg (Ed.): Institutioneller Rassismus Ein Pl√§doyer f√ºr deutschlandweite Aktionspl√§ne gegen Rassismus und ethnische Diskriminierung, 2011, 39. describing how the TV news series for children Logo! explains terrorism to its young viewers. For this purpose, it shows pictures of non-white Arabic terrorists. The children learn to associate People of Color with terrorism. Logo could have used a picture of a RAF terrorist as well. To end this practice, Erg√ºn-Hamaz proposes to introduce an organization as the Ofcom in Germany. =Personal life= Erg√ºn-Hamaz is married to Sofia Hamaz. She is an editor and social researcher. They lived in London for four years, until they moved back to Berlin in 2011. Their son, Jibril Yeshaya, was born in 2013. Anti-Racism Work=Novel= Erg√ºn-Hamaz has been active in the anti-racism community in Germany. This has been most reflected in his studies and in the writing of his only novel Kara G√ºnl√ºk. Die geheimen Tageb√ºcher des Sesperado. The novel was written primarily for People of Color with the purpose of making social theories on racism and empowerment available to non-academics and people with less formal education. The novel is fictional, however much of it is based on the personal experiences of Erg√ºn-Hamaz, his family and his friends, while also being supplemented by realistic invented experiences. The book was well received by audiences of color, while white audiences had more mixed responses, feeling rather offended by it . Erg√ºn-Hamaz refers to his novel as a bildungsroman. The book is written in the form of a diary. The protagonist, a university student who goes by the name Sesperado, describes and reflects on his experiences as an anti-racist activist and on those of his friends living in a society shaped by everyday racism. =Other Engagements= In 2001, Erg√ºn- Hamaz joined Phoenix e.V. one of the oldest and largest anti-racism NGOs in Germany with over 500 members in more than 30 countries. Initially starting out as a trainee, it took him some seven years to truly understand the purpose of the company and what he was doing there. Erg√ºn-Hamaz now sits on the extended board of the organization and facilitates regional groups in the Frankfurt area. He is also part of the Phoenix Train the Trainers meetings, which take place twice a year, where trainers and trainees have the opportunity to develop and learn. In 2004, together with Deniz Utlu, Erg√ºn- Hamaz began monthly \\"a thousand words deep\\" readings at Cafe VorWien to provide to writers and musicians of color with a platform to present their work. At the end of each session, Erg√ºn-Hamaz or Utlu would then present their own readings. It was during this time that much of Erg√ºn-Hamaz's novel was written, incorporating much of the live audience feedback. During this process the main character of the novel was also born. These performances were pivotal as they helped Erg√ºn-Hamaz realize his love of making people laugh. He believes that laughter and humor help people to loosen and open up to ideas that challenge their worldview. From 2008 to 2012, along with friend Noah Sow, Erg√ºn-Hamaz led a show called Edutainment Attacke! It was inspired by Erg√ºn- Hamaz's novel, and Sow's novel Deutschland Schwarz Weiss. Der allt√§gliche Rassismus. The purpose was to create an entertaining and educational show in order to educate White people and People of Color about everyday racism in Germany. The show's success resulted in Erg√ºn-Hamaz being approached by Unrast Verlag (de) in order to publish his novel. Works= Novels = *Kara G√ºnl√ºk.

During Operation Barbarossa, it was subordinated to the SS and deployed in German-occupied areas, specifically the Army Group Centre Rear Area, of the Soviet Union, as part of Police Regiment Centre. Alongside detachments from the Einsatzgruppen, it perpetrated mass murder in the Holocaust and was responsible for large-scale crimes against humanity targeting civilian populations. In mid-1942, the battalion was reassigned to the 23rd Police Regiment and operated in Belarus. Background and formation The German Order Police was a key instrument of the security apparatus of Nazi Germany. In the prewar period, Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, and Kurt Daluege, chief of the Order Police, cooperated in transforming the police force of the Weimar Republic into militarised formations ready to serve the regime's aims of conquest and racial annihilation. The police units participated in the annexation of Austria and the occupation of Czechoslovakia. Police troops were first formed into battalion-sized formations for the invasion of Poland, where they were deployed for security and policing purposes, also taking part in executions and mass deportations. Twenty-three Order Police battalions were slated to take part in the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa. Nine were attached to security divisions of the Wehrmacht. Two battalions were assigned to support the Einsatzgruppen, the mobile death squads of the SS, and the Organisation Todt, the military construction group. Twelve were formed into regiments, three battalions each, and designated as Police Regiments Centre, North, South, and Special Purpose. The goals of the police battalions were to secure the rear by eliminating the remnants of the enemy forces, guarding the prisoners of war, and protecting the lines of communications and captured industrial facilities. Their instructions also included, as Daluege stated, the \\"combat of criminal elements, above all political elements\\". Along with Police Battalion 316 and 322, Police Battalion 307 was assigned to Police Regiment Centre. Comprising about 550 men, the battalion was raised from recruits mobilised from the 1905‚Äì1915 year groups. They were led by career police professionals, steeped in the ideology of Nazism, driven by anti- semitism and anti-Bolshevism. The regiment was placed under the command of , a career policeman. When it crossed the German-Soviet border, the regiment came under the control of Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, the Higher SS and Police Leader (HSS-PF) for Army Group Centre. Operational history In early July, Police Battalion 307 participated in the massacre of 4‚Äì6,000 Jewish men, Russians and Belarussians in the vicinity of Brest-Litovsk (now Brest, Belarus). Himmler made a personal visit to the headquarters of the regiment in Belostok on 8 July where he spoke to Montua, Bach-Zalewski and the regiment's officers. On 10 July, Daluege visited the unit and addressed the members of the regiment arrayed in a parade formation, extolling them to \\"exterminate\\" Bolshevism as a \\"blessing for Germany\\". On 11 July, Montua passed a confidential order from Bach-Zalewski to the battalion commanders that Jews, who had been \\"convicted of looting\\", were to be shot; an execution took place the same day. Victims hanged by the police troops in the Soviet Union, August/September 1941 On 17 July, the regiment murdered over 1,100 Jews in Slonim, with Bach-Zalewski reporting to Himmler on 18 July: \\"Yesterday's cleansing action in Slonim by Police Regiment Centre. 1,153 Jewish plunderers were shot\\". By 20 July, the unit's reports referred to executions of Jewish women and children. In December, after the German defeat in the Battle of Moscow, the regiment was sent to the front lines to reinforce the German defenses, thus depriving Bach-Zalewski of manpower. Police Battalion 307 was deployed near Kaluga on 20 December and had been reduced to a combat strength of 60 men by March. Police Battalions 307, 316, and 322 were reassigned to other regiments and continued to engage in security warfare (Bandenbek√§mpfung, or \\"bandit-fighting\\") and genocide. Battalion 307 was assigned to the 23rd SS Police Regiment and took part in the punitive in Belarus. Aftermath The Order Police as a whole had not been declared a criminal organisation by the Allies, unlike the SS. Its members were able to reintegrate into society largely unmolested, with many returning to police careers in Austria and West Germany.

Many of them came from places in the Middle- east or Central Asia, but a vast majority of the population were local converts to Islam. Over the years, the local people have been digging out numerous stone idols from all around. Most of these seem to be belonging to the Pala era. There are a large number of idols of Hindu deities but the majority are Buddhist deities, including a number of figures showing Buddha in the vajrasana pose. Many of the idols were damaged in the process of crude methods of recovery. These recoveries lead to the belief that the area was once dominated by Buddhists, who converted to Islam.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part I, 1976 edition, pages 284-289, Prakash Bhaban, Kolkata Binoy Ghosh opines that the main centres of Buddhism were in eastern and northern Bengal, and it was easier to convert them to Islam because of the strong anti-Hindu mentality that the Buddhists had. Such centres were rare in western Bengal. He also notes the strong feelings of amity between Hindus and a fairly large Muslim population that he observed in Rampurhat subdivision.

The building stands at 521 ft (158.8 m) and includes 478 individual units spanning 46 floors.  Building  The Atelier building is located at 635 West 42nd Street in Manhattan, New York. It is part of several high-rise buildings (along with Sky and Silver Towers) built in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Midtown Manhattan that have transformed the area between 11th and 12th Avenue. At a height of 521 ft (158.8 m), Atelier looks over the Hudson River located a block away to the West. The building stands 46-stories tall and contains a total of 478 individual units. The building's name comes from the word for an artist's workshop. The building features an art gallery on the ground floor and often holds exhibitions of artwork. The gallery is also visible from the street and includes the lobby of the building as part of its exhibit space. As of January 2009, it featured the works of graphic designer and New York-based artist Milton Glaser. In 2011, solar panels were installed on the roof of the building capable of generating five percent of the energy needs of the building. As of 2013, solar panels were generating ten percent of the building's energy needs. In 2014, Atelier became one of the first buildings in New York to include an ice-skating rink on the roof of the building which was installed by Daniel Neiditch, president of the condo board who owns 100 units in the building. The rooftop terrace is also the location of a private lounge open to residents of the building. As of 2014, the building also has several other amenities such as access to a playground, a basketball court, and a tennis court. In 2016, Atelier promoted the most expensive planned condominium property in New York City. The penthouse property spanning the entire 45th floor of the building and including 10 bedrooms and 13 bathrooms was listed in 2016 at $85 million. It was to be created by combining nine units located on the top floor. The plan was to include such lavish amenities as a one-million-dollar yacht, two Rolls- Royce Phantoms, and a year's worth of \\"live-in butler services ‚Äì as well as a private chef\\". In 2018, Atelier was raided by Mayor's Office of Special Enforcement for short-term rentals. access-date=2018-02-08}}  History  Atelier was designed by Costas Kondylis. Construction on the building began in 2004 and was completed in 2007. Atelier was part of the company's development project of Manhattan's West Side which included several buildings along 11th Avenue. The building has been a popular destination for celebrities including Deborah Cox, Brendan Fraser, Lindsay Lohan, Mekhi Phifer, and Dania Ramirez, some of whom have used it for brief stays in New York while performing on Broadway.  In popular culture  As a prominent Hell's Kitchen building, Atelier, as well as adjoining Sky, were featured prominently in the NETFLIX series Marvel's The Defenders. Nighttime scenes were filmed in the lobby and culminated with the depiction of the destruction of the building, known within the series as \\"Midland Circle\\", in the series finale.

It is housed inside the former Bridges Street Market at No. 2, Bridges Street in Central District, Hong Kong Island. The heritage building was among the first batch of public markets built after the end of World War II and was opened in 1953. The building sits partly on the former site of the American Congregational Mission Preaching Hall, where Dr Sun Yat-sen, founder of the Republic of China, was baptised in 1884. In 2013, under Batch III of the Revitalising Historic Buildings Through Partnership Scheme, the Journalism Education Foundation Hong Kong Limited was granted the right to revitalise the property into Asia's first education facility with news as the main theme.Bridges Street Market Resources Kit by Commissioner of Heritage Office, Development Bureau.. In April 2016, the Legislative Council's Finance Committee approved the allocation of HK$85.3 million for the revitalisation project.Asia's first News-Expo : press release by Journalism Education Foundation Hong Kong Limited on 21 February 2013.. The venue has a total floor area of about 10,000 square feet. Hong Kong News-Expo was opened to the public on the 6th of December 2018. Its exhibits chronicle the evolution of Hong Kong's news media, present the city's political, economic and social transformations through contemporary news reports, and demonstrate the importance of the free flow of information as a cornerstone of Hong Kong's success. Facilities and activities Hong Kong News-Expo will feature exhibitions that: * Present the evolution of Hong Kong's newspapers, radio news, television news and online news through historical TV footage, audio and visual records, news clippings, artefacts and published information; * Explore how changes in the methods of disseminating news have impacted the media and the society in this age of information; * Demonstrate the importance of the free flow of information by showing how major new events were covered by different Hong Kong media; * Showcase outstanding works of photo journalism; and * Focus on specific media-related topics, such as the Reporting of the 2008 Sichuan Earthquakes. Hong Kong News-Expo will also have the following facilities: * Experiential and interactive studios for visitors to experience being a reporter in front of a camera; * A souvenir shop that sells books and souvenirs related to news; and * A multi-purpose room for media education activities. Activities being planned include: * Media education activities for students and youth; * Seminars and workshops on media-related topics; * Guided tours for visitors on Saturday and Sunday; and * Guided tours for the elderly and under-privileged groups. History=Dr Sun Yat-sen = Bridges Street Market sits on part of the original site of the American Congregational Mission Preaching Hall (now China Congregational Church), which was founded by the Reverend Charles Robert Hager in 1883. In 1884, Dr Sun Yat-sen, founder of republican China, was baptised there while studying at the nearby Government Central School (now Queen's College). The market is located in a very old part of Central with deep historical connections to the Hong Kong press. Most of the city's earliest newspapers set up their first offices there. Shing Wong Street, Gough Street and Wing Lee Street in the vicinity were known as the ‚ÄúPrinters‚Äô Streets\\" because of the clusters of printers and related businesses that used to operate there. The newspapers that had set up their offices in the area included: * Chun Wan Yat Po (Universal Circulating Herald) * China Daily * Wah Kiu Yat Po * Kung Sheung Daily News * South China Morning Post * Ta Kung Pao * New Evening Post * New Life Evening Post (Hsin Sheng Wan Pao) * Wen Wei Po * Hung Look Daily News * Yuet Wah Daily News =Post-World War II markets= Bridges Street Market was built after the Second World War on the recommendation of the then Urban Council to cater to the demand for market services because of a surge in population. The market was inaugurated on April 30, 1953. On its ground floor were 26 stalls selling fish and poultry and on the first floor 33 selling beef, pork, fruit and vegetables. In 1969, part of the first floor was turned into a children's playground and two footbridges were built to link the building with Wing Lee Street. =Revitalisation= Bridges Street Market was classified as a Grade III historic building in September 2011. It was later included in Batch III of the Revitalising Historic Buildings Through Partnership Scheme. In February 2013, the Development Bureau announced that it had accepted the revitalisation proposal submitted by the Journalism Education Foundation Hong Kong Limited. The proposal aims to re-purpose the historic building to accommodate Hong Kong News-Expo, which will become an education-cum-exhibition facility for media education activities that would enhance both local and overseas visitors‚Äô understanding of the Hong Kong news media. Conservation work=Conservation projects= Bridges Street Market will retain its original Bauhaus-style architectural design. The market's main staircases, poultry scalding room and some existing stalls will be kept for their representation of social and historical values. A lift will be built to provide unobstructed access to Wing Lee Street. The rubbish collection station adjacent to the market will be demolished. The original uphill vista of the staircases at Shing Wong Street leading to the Mid-Levels will be restored. =Architectural characteristics= A three-storey utilitarian building, Bridges Street Market is a reinforced concrete frame structure built in the International Modernist style generally accepted as originated in Germany by the Bauhaus School of Art in the 1920s. The architectural style's main characteristics, which can also be found in the market, include asymmetry, severe blocky cubic shapes, smooth flat plain undecorated surfaces often painted white, the complete elimination of all mouldings and ornament, flat roofs, large expanses of glass held in steel frames on the elevation, and long horizontal streamlined bands of windows. The adoption of reinforced concrete post-and-slab construction with flat slab floors and a flat roof-slab carried on concrete columns has created room for free planning. Partitions could be erected freely as desired, as they played no part in the structure bearing function of the building. The front elevation of the market facing Bridges Street is an asymmetrical composition with the main entrance recessed on the left side flanked by a panel of Shanghai plaster grooved to resemble masonry. Above this panel is a large grid pattern window which illuminates the internal staircase. The remainder of the elevation is a plain painted rendered wall featuring two horizontal streamlined bands of windows with projected horizontal sun-shading concrete fins. =Mini-exhibitions and seminars= ;Newspapers and Old Hong Kong Organised by the Journalism Education Foundation, an exhibition and a series of seminars on newspapers and Old Hong Kong were held at the G7 Centre, Wing Lee Street, between September 6 and October 13 in 2013. Copies of newspapers published in the 1960s and 1970s were displayed to give a glimpse of Hong Kong society at that time.

Frequently known by the diminutive Fidelito, he was the eldest son of Cuban leader Fidel Castro and his first wife, Mirta Diaz-Balart. Life and career Castro D√≠az-Balart (left) with President of Mexico Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, 28 January 2014, 2nd CELAC Summit, Havana. Castro D√≠az-Balart's parents divorced in 1955, prior to the Cuban Revolution in which his father seized power in that country. His mother moved to Miami, United States, with the Diaz-Balart family, taking her son with her. Castro D√≠az-Balart returned to Cuba as a child to visit his father, and remained there for the rest of his childhood. In 1959, he appeared as a 9-year-old during an interview with his father on U.S. television. Castro D√≠az-Balart moved to Moscow (in what was then the Soviet Union), where he enrolled at Voronezh State University in 1968. For safety, he studied under the code name \\"Jos√© Ra√∫l Fern√°ndez\\", which he claimed to have chosen in homage to world chess champion Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca and to have later used to publish 30 scientific publications. He initially studied physical education before switching to nuclear physics in 1970. He graduated from Lomonosov Moscow State University, and went on to work at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, and to receive his first doctorate from Lomonosov, in 1978. Returning to Cuba, he was placed in charge of Cuba's nuclear power program for a time, leading the Juragua Nuclear Power Plant construction program from 1980 to 1992, during which time he was also the executive secretary of the country's Atomic Energy Commission. He served as a member of the Nonaligned Countries Movement's Coordinating Countries for the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy, and was elected to chair the Second Meeting of that group in April 1983.Executive Office of the President, Latin America Report (1983), Issue 2696, p. 2. Castro D√≠az-Balart was removed from his positions in June 1992, following a falling out with his father, who cited \\"inefficiency\\" as the reason for the removal. Castro then announced the suspension of construction at Juragua in September 1992, due to Cuba's inability to meet the financial terms set by Russia to complete the reactors. Castro D√≠az-Balart then returned to further his studies in Moscow, and received his second doctorate at the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy in 1999. In the 2010s, he returned to a level of prominence, serving as a scientific advisor to the Council of State, the governing body of Cuba, and as vice-president of the Academy of Sciences of Cuba. Throughout his career, Castro Diaz-Balart authored articles on the developing role of nuclear energy. In 2012, Castro Diaz-Balart disputed reports that Fidel Castro was becoming senile, describing his father as \\"lucid\\" and \\"working hard\\", which was similar to the \\"upbeat assessment\\" of Castro's health that Castro Diaz- Balart made in February 2007, following Castro's illness during that period. In April 2014, he visited Russia to declare Cuba's recognition of the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, also receiving an honorary doctorate at Voronezh State University. In February 2015, during the Cuban thaw towards the end of the Obama Administration, when Americans were more freely allowed to visit Cuba, he participated in events to welcome American celebrities to the island, mingling with Paris Hilton and Naomi Campbell. The following month, he visited Novosibirsk, Russia, meeting with the mayor, Anatoly Lokot, and regional governor Vladimir Gorodetsky to improve Cuban relations with scientific institutions in the region. Family Castro D√≠az- Balart had three children ‚Äî Mirta Mar√≠a, Fidel Antonio and Jos√© Ra√∫l ‚Äî with Natasha Smirnova, whom he met in Russia. After divorcing Smirnova, he married Mar√≠a Victoria Barreiro from Cuba. U.S. Congressman Mario D√≠az-Balart, currently representing the 25th district of Florida, and former U.S. Congressman Lincoln D√≠az-Balart were his maternal cousins. Death Castro D√≠az-Balart killed himself in Havana on 1 February 2018, aged 68. He had previously received outpatient care for depression. The report of his suicide by the Cuban government was described as \\"unusually public.\\" Fidel Angel Castro Diaz-Balart's first cousin Gabriel Diaz-Balart had also earlier committed suicide as a result of depression.Miami Herald: September 19, 2014: Lincoln Diaz-Balart tells own story, help needed to prevent suicide At his death he still held his positions with the Cuban Academy of Sciences and the Council of State.

It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to thirty five small, green and reddish purple flowers. It is only known from the Brindabella Range where it grows in Eucalyptus forest. Description Genoplesium ectopum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf and fused to the flowering stem, the free part long. Between fifteen and thirty five green and reddish purple flowers are arranged along a flowering stem reaching to a height of long and much taller than the leaf. The flowers are about long and wide and are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is long and about wide. The lateral sepals are long, about wide, with a humped base and spread apart from each other. The petals are about long and wide with a few hairs on their edges. The labellum is purple, about long, wide with coarse hairs up to long and the labellum vibrates in the slightest breeze. There is a callus in the centre of the labellum but not extending to its tip. Flowering occurs from January to March. Taxonomy and naming Genoplesium ectopum was first formally described in 1999 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Brindabella Ranges and the description was published in The Orchadian. In 2002, Jones and Mark Alwin Clements changed the name to Corunastylis ectopa. The specific epithet (ectopum) derived from the Ancient Greek word ektopos meaning \\"out of place\\". Distribution and habitat The Brindabella midge orchid is only known from a single site in the Brindabella Range at an altitude of where it grows in Eucalyptus forest. Conservation The entire population of this midge orchid grows within of a road embankment prone to erosion. Population estimates range from about 35 following bushfires and drought, to the present at about 110. The main threats to the species are erosion, roadworks, weed invasion, shrub growth and inappropriate use of herbicides.

The windscreen comes from the Riley 1.5, as does the indicator stalk on the right of the steering column. The SX1000 has the same front disc and rear drum brake arrangement as the standard Mini Cooper. A racing version of the SX1000 was produced later in 1962, the Ogle Lightweight GT.

He worked as a schoolteacher in Volda in the Sunnm√∏re district and then served as a lensmann. Life Aarflot is known for his work in community education and for introducing improvements in agriculture. As a young man, he was taught by the parish priest Hans Str√∏m in Volda. He became a peripatetic teacher in 1778 and then a lensman in Volda in 1798. In 1800 he moved to the Ekset farm, where he set up a print shop in 1808 and issued the weekly newspaper Norsk Landboeblad. He also established a Sunday school here in 1802, where teaching in the natural sciences had a prominent place, and he made his book collection available to the general public. For these efforts, he was honored with the gold medal of the Danish Society of Agriculture. In 1811 he founded the Welfare Society for the Parish of Volda (Selskabet for Voldens Pr√¶stegj√¶lds Vel). His children were the hymn writer and author Berte Canutte Aarflot (1795‚Äì1859) and the editor and politician Rasmus Aarflot (1792‚Äì1845). Sivert Aarflot was one of the first Norwegians to write about house marks, in his article \\"Om nogle af Hovedkaraktererne iblandt de saakaldte gaml√¶vis Bum√¶rkji, som ellers heder Runebogstaver\\" (Regarding Some of the Main Characteristics among the So-Called Old-Fashioned House Marks, Otherwise Called Runic Characters), published in Norsk Landboeblad in 1811. The philologist Ivar Aasen (1813‚Äì1896) gained much of his first knowledge from the bookshelves at Ekset. The √Ösen farm lies only three kilometers from Ekset, and so they were almost neighbors. Aarflot himself had made observations about the relationship between the Sunnm√∏re dialect and Old West Norse, and this may have inspired the young Aasen. Aarflot was a member of the Sunnm√∏re Practical Agricultural Society (Syndm√∏re practiske Landhuusholdningsselskab).  Print shop owner and newspaper publisher  First front page of the newspaper Norsk Landboeblad On December 22, 1807, Aarflot wrote a lengthy request to the king in Copenhagen asking permission to start his own print shop. In his request he listed the handwritten works that he held in his private library and wished to print in thirteen points. In addition, he made it clear that he planned to publish a weekly newspaper called The Village Gazette for Norway (\\"Et Ugeblad Kaldet: Landboebladet for Norge\\"). In May 1808, the postal service recommended a postage exemption for the newspaper in Norway and Denmark. On July 15, 1808, Aarflot received permission to engage in printing operations. With the help of a friend from Trondheim engaged in book printing, Aarflot started printing in 1809. This was the first print shop to operate outside of a town in Norway (√Ölesund was not a town at that time).

Institutions and mechanisms According to researchers, low trust societies are typically kinship based; outcomes of low trust societies can include difficulty in forming and maintaining corporate structures. Mechanisms and institutions that are corrupted, dysfunctional, or absent in low-trust societies include respect for private property rights, a trusted civil court system, democratic voting and acceptance of electoral outcomes, and voluntary tax payment. Research has identified a correlation between individualism with high-trust societies, and collectivism with low-trust cultures. Self governance High-trust societies display a high degree of mutual trust not imposed by outside \\"contractual, legal or hierarchical regulation\\", but instead are based upon \\"prior moral consensus\\". Much writing on the subject refers to Francis Fukuyama's 1995 book, Trust: Social Virtues and Creation of Prosperity, in which he describes \\"the ability of various peoples to organize effectively for commercial purposes without relying on blood ties or government intervention\\".

According to eyewitness testimony and video evidence first reported by the Associated Press, victims of the massacre were buried in five mass graves by the Myanmar Army and burnt with acid. An official count given by the Burmese government put the death toll at ten, whilst Rohingya village elders recorded a list of 75 people who may have died in the massacre and locals estimated that up to 400 people were killed in the massacre. Background The Rohingya people are an ethnic minority that mainly live in the northern region of Rakhine State, Myanmar, and have been described as one of the world's most persecuted minorities. In modern times, the persecution of Rohingyas in Myanmar dates back to the 1970s. Since then, Rohingya people have regularly been made the target of persecution by the government and nationalist Buddhists. The tension between various religious groups in the country had often been exploited by the past military governments of Myanmar. According to Amnesty International, the Rohingya have suffered from human rights violations under past military dictatorships since 1978, and many have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh as a result. In 2005, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had assisted with the repatriation of Rohingyas from Bangladesh, but allegations of human rights abuses in the refugee camps threatened this effort. In 2015, 140,000 Rohingyas remained in IDP camps after communal riots in 2012. On 25 August 2017, insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) launched their second large-scale attack on the Myanmar Army, leading to new \\"clearance operations\\" by the government, which critics argue targeted civilians. Massacre According to survivors of the massacre, the Myanmar Army had planned out and prepared for the massacre prior to it happening; this was possibly done with the intent of enacting revenge for attacks made by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). Locals in Gu Dar Pyin spotted soldiers buying twelve large containers of acid near the village market two days prior to the massacre. On 27 August 2017, at around noon, over 200 soldiers from the Tatmadaw stormed Gu Dar Pyin from a Buddhist village to the south, firing on fleeing Rohingya villagers. Many of those fleeing hid in a coconut grove near the river and watched as the Myanmar Army and masked local collaborators looted homes of valuables before burning them down. Afterwards, Myanmar Army soldiers and their collaborators began searching for survivors in the grove, executing those found. According to eyewitnesses, children and elderly were thrown into burning huts by soldiers. Another group of soldiers surrounded Gu Dar Pyin from the north whilst soldiers were still searching in the grove, entrapping remaining Rohingyas in Gu Dar Pyin. Some survivors of the initial attack managed to hide under a bridge near Gu Dar Pyin as soldiers began burning corpses with acid and loading them onto three trucks heading for the cemetery. One eyewitness described watching the village burn for 16 hours until the Myanmar Army finally withdrew. Aftermath Days after the massacre, survivors and Rohingyas from nearby villages went back to the charred remains of Gu Dar Pyin to retrieve victims left for dead and corpses the Myanmar Army had left behind. The Associated Press stated on 1 February 2018 that it had confirmed the massacre took place in Gu Dar Pyin, after interviewing over two dozen survivors and obtaining video evidence of the mass killing and its aftermath. Myanmar's government responded by insisting the massacre never happened, and that only 19 \\"terrorists\\" were killed and \\"carefully buried\\" in the village. Responses : The Myanmar government's information committee issued a statement on 2 February 2018, denying the accusations that a massacre took place, stating that a team of 17 government officials were sent to Gu Dar Pyin and returned without evidence or confirmation from villagers that it happened. The statement further claimed that only 19 \\"terrorists\\" were killed in Gu Dar Pyin by security forces \\"acting in self-defense\\". An Associated Press spokesperson rejected the government's claims, saying, \\"The Associated Press stands by our reporting.\\" : The day after the Associated Press confirmed the existence of the mass graves, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a press briefing, \\"We are deeply, deeply troubled by those reports of mass graves [in Myanmar]. We are watching this very carefully. We remain focused on helping to ensure the accountability for those responsible for human rights abuses and violations.\\" See also * Inn Din massacre * Tula Toli massacre * 2017 Rohingya persecution in Myanmar * List of massacres in Myanmar References 2017 in Myanmar Internal conflict in Myanmar History of Rakhine Rohingya conflict Massacres in Myanmar Massacres in 2017 Persecution by Buddhists Persecution of Muslims Violence against Muslims August 2017 crimes in Asia Massacres of Muslims ","title":"Gu Dar Pyin massacre"},{"id":"56474285","title":"2018 AH"},{"id":"56474292","title":"Baseer Ali"},{"id":"56474324","text":"Aylam Orian is an American actor, who plays the role of Dr. Wilhelm Br√ºcke, the high-ranking Nazi officer, occultist and series main antagonist, in the MGM limited web series Stargate Origins.

ThirdLove was the first bra and underwear brand to offer trademarked half cup sizing and a mobile app allowing women to measure themselves at home. It also uses a technology referred to as Fit Finder which combines machine learning algorithms and customer feedback to select the best bra size.  History  ThirdLove was founded by husband and wife Heidi Zak and David Spector. They left their jobs and launched the company in a loft in downtown San Francisco in November 2013. Through a Craigslist ad, the company gathered one hundred participants, who were told to take a photo of themselves wearing a tight tank top over their bras. While the R&D; session was intended to refine an app for calculating bust size, Zak found that the bras themselves needed improving. When the participants tried on ThirdLove's bra prototype, they found out that 37 percent of them fell between cup sizes. Ra'el Cohen, founder of lingerie company Luv & Honey, joined ThirdLove and used the data from the Craigslist fittings to create the company's own proprietary molds. ThirdLove became the first bra company to create half-sizes. ThirdLove was introduced to startup Indi Custom who was developing a smartphone-based technology to customize jeans without fit models. They acquired the company and adapted the technology for bras, taking two years to develop the company's patented technology app. They launched the company bra line in the spring of 2014 with seven distinct styles. Within three months, they identified \\"24/7\\" as their best style and discontinued producing the other six styles. In 2015, they found a manufacturing partner in China that was willing to include their proprietary design elements. As of late 2016, the company shipped approximately 50,000 bras a month. ThirdLove expanded into underwear, as well as lounge and sleepwear. In June 2018, the company added 24 new larger. As of October 2018, Forbes estimated ThirdLove to be worth $750 million and was placed on the Forbes Next Billion Dollar Startup List. In 2019, they opened their first pop-up shop in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood from July 24 through the year's end.

He is most famous for the sword and sorcery trilogy started with Raum. Life and work Sherrell was a commercial artist for most of his life, occasionally working as pulp illustrator for publications such as Fantasy Newsletter or even esoterical non-fiction works such as Frater Albertus's From \\"One\\" to \\"Ten\\". Starting in 1979, Sherrell began a career as a novelist in which he would try several genres. His first and most successful attempt was Raum, a sword and sorcery fantasy starring an eponymous anti-hero, the demon Raum, who after being summoned by a wizard into an alternate history medieval Britain causes considerable mayhem before encountering King Arthur, Merlin, Morgan le Fay and other characters of Arthurian Legend who will eventually teach him about life here and inspire him human values. Despite his first novel's cliffhanger ending, Sherrell would abandon the character and the genre to try a more high fantasy-oriented style in Arcane, starring a fool in a world governed by the rules of tarot. It would be followed by the space opera The Space Prodigal (1981). The sequel to Raum, Skraelings, would appear in 1987. In it, Raum chases a Viking prince who has stolen his great love, Lady Vivienne, from Iceland to Greenland and up to North America (skr√¶lingjar is how Norse Greenlanders called Native Americans). The horror novel The Curse (1989) would be his last to be published in the English language due to his untimely death in 1990. However, his manuscript of a third book in the Raum series was translated to Spanish and published in Spain in 1995. The first two novels were also translated to German and French.

It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to fifteen small, green to greenish yellow flowers with purplish markings and a reddish purple labellum. It was formerly included with Corunastylis archeri, and C. ciliata is regarded as a synonym of Genoplesium archeri by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families. Plants in this species have fewer, more erect flowers, a less-hairy labellum and have different coloration than C. archeri. Description Corunastylis ciliata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Up to fifteen flowers are crowded along a flowering stem tall and taller than the leaf. The flowers are green to yellowish green with pale purple markings and are long and wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, about long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear to lance- shaped, about long, wide and spread apart from each other. The petals are lance-shaped to narrow egg-shaped, about long and wide with hairless edges and a pointed tip. The labellum is broadly elliptic to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide with scattered hairs up to long on the edges. There is a tapered callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs from February to April. Taxonomy and naming The fringed midge orchid was first formally described in 1912 by Alfred Ewart and Bertha Rees and the description was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria. In 1989 David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Corunastylis ciliata. The specific epithet (ciliata) is from a Latin word cilium meaning \\"eyelash\\". Distribution and habitat Corunastylis ciliata grows in heath, grassy woodland and heathy forest in Victoria mostly west of Wilsons Promontory. In South Australia it grows in moist places in or near swamps and is found on Mount Compass and Mount Gambier.

Proceedings of the Royal Society B 285: 20172494 In 2011, a bird fossil, specimen STM35-3 found at Dawangzhangzi, was referred to Hongshanornis.Zheng X-T., Martin L.D., Zhou Z-H., Burnham D.A., Zhang F-C., Miao D. 2011 \\"Fossil evidence of avian crops from the Early Cretaceous of China\\". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. USA 108: 15 904‚Äì15 907 Subsequently, that genus was proven to possess teeth, while STM35-3 is toothless. Additional research showed that the latter represented a species new to science. In 2018, the type species Eogranivora edentulata was named and described by Zheng Xiaoting, Jingmai Kathleen O'Connor, Wang Xiaoli, Wang Yan and Zhou Zhonghe. The generic name combines a Greek eos, \\"dawn\\", with Neolatin granivora, \\"group of seed eaters\\", in reference to the species being the oldest known seed-eating ornithuromorph bird. The specific name means \\"toothless\\" in Latin. Eogranivora was the first fossil bird species to have been named in 2018. The holotype, STM35-3, was discovered in a layer of the Yixian Formation dating from the early Aptian, at about 125 million years old. It consists of a nearly complete skeleton with skull, compressed on a plate and counterplate. The splitting of the slabs damaged the bones of the fossil. It is largely articulated. Extensive but vague remains of the plumage have been preserved as well as a crop with seeds and a stomach with gastroliths. Eogranivora is a medium-sized basal ornithuromorph. The describing authors indicated a distinguishing combination of traits, in themselves not unique. Both upper and lower jaws are toothless. The front of the lower jaws is fused into a symphysis for a fifth of their lengths. The coracoid does not have a clear process to contact the side of the breastbone. The outer and intermediate rear processes of the breastbone are thin and project to the rear to the same level. The central xiphoid process at the rear of the breastbone is V-shaped. The first finger is short but robust. The pubic bone at its top has a triangular process pointing to above and the inside, at a third of its shaft length. The first metatarsal and the first toe are completely lacking. Eogranivora was placed in the Ornithuromorpha, in a rather basal position in a polytomy, below the Hongshanornithidae but above Archaeorhynchus. The combination of a crop with seeds‚Äîthe first time for a Mesozoic ornithuromorph‚Äîa mass of small gastroliths and a toothless beak was seen as a specialisation to eat seeds. Ornithuromorphs which still possessed teeth were hypothesised to have been omnivores. The loss of the first toe would be an adaptation to a running lifestyle.

The main structure of the vessel was constructed by Safehaven Marine, a boatbuilding company based in Cork. In February 2018, it was announced that the ship would be named HMS Magpie. The type selected for the inshore survey vessel was based on Safehaven's Wildcat 60 catamaran design, the largest available at 18m in length, and with a displacement of 37 tonnes. Magpie was built to accommodate a crew of 12 for up to seven days, with the capability of operating in all weathers. Following completion and initial trials by Safehaven Marine, Magpie was subsequently delivered to Atlas Elektronik UK (AEUK) for installation of its mission equipment. In April 2018, Magpie underwent further trials with its mission equipment installed, before final delivery of the vessel to the Royal Navy in May 2018 for commissioning in early summer. As Magpie is considerably larger than the vessel she replaces, the title of smallest commissioned vessel in the Royal Navy, which had belonged to Gleaner, passed to the two s.

Biography=Early life= Andreas Jakob came from the Nikolsburger (Moravian) line of the noble family Dietrichstein, whose origin can be traced back to Carinthia. His father was Maximilian Andreas (1638-1692), Count of Dietrichstein, his mother Maria Justina (1647-1696), daughter of Edmund III, Count of Schwarzenberg. =Ecclesiastical career= He studied from 1707 in Salzburg, where he became a canon in 1713, cathedral dean in 1729, and cathedral provost in 1730. On 10 September 1747, he was elected Archbishop of Salzburg. He was probably a compromise candidate for the canons, but the people clearly desired a Salzburg prince at the time, namely Dietrichstein. The episcopal consecration was performed on 1 June 1749 by Josef Maria Reichsgraf von Thun und Hohenstein, Bishop of Gurk. He was a worthy and, unlike his predecessor, popular archbishop of a simple and gaunt look. He was a notable connoisseur of Salzburg life, a zealous and emphatically industrious person, but also a friend of festivals, masked balls and the theater. Dietrichstein also suffered from the great financial difficulties of the archbishopric, which had been significantly aggravated by the previous Protestant expulsion. He was able to reduce the amount required by the Pope for his episcopal consecration and also achieved that this was paid by Maria Theresa of Austria. In view of the financial difficulties, he campaigned on one hand for special frugality in his court and in the administration, with restrictions on court dress, and abandoning construction of large buildings, all the while promoting economic growth to the best of his ability. Grave monument of Archbishop Dietrichstein in Salzburg Cathedral. The Wasserspiele in Hellbrunn were only poorly repaired. The \\"Mechanical Theater\\" of the Hellbrunner Wasserspiele was newly built. Lorenz Rosenegger committed 343 guilders to create 100 new figures and to initiate construction, which was met with several difficulties and a significant increase in costs. Dietrichstein also renovated the dilapidated Andreaskirche (Linzergasse). Dietrichstein's motto was \\"amore et justitia\\" - \\"Through love and justice\\" - a principle to which he remained loyal for life as a just prince and friend of the people. Dietrichstein died on 5 January 1753. Despite all the accentuated thrift, Dietrichstein left his successor high debts. Archbishop Dietrichstein was buried in the crypt of the Salzburg Cathedral.

History  The movement was founded in 1947 inside its nowadays umbrella organization Union of the German Catholic Youth (, ). In the first years, the name of KLJB was \\"Action of the rural youth\\" (). Main actions in the founding years were \\"rural seminars\\" to discuss rural formation and the social situation in the villages in rural areas. The members of KLJB developed five educational objectives in the 1950s and chose the association's patron Nicholas of Fl√ºe. During the time, MIJARC () was founded as international \\"Catholic Agricultural and Rural Youth Movement\\" (CARYM). KLJB was one of its founding members. In 1961, KLJB's umbrella organization BDKJ decided to built KLJB as independent federal association in Germany and to have it as one of the member organizations in BDKJ. The name of the former \\"Action of the rural youth\\" was finally switched to its today's name. In the 1970s, topics like democracy, social justice and peace were main issues, but also the merging of the men's youth and the women's youth of KLJB into one common association with a common federal board. Since that time, the boards on local, regional, diocesan and federal levels are elected due to gender parity. In the 1980s, KLJB focused on ecology and energy politics, but also on the formation of the rural areas. A big mile stone in the 1990s was the introduction of the campaign \\"eco fair wear\\" () and the founding of the clothing brand LamuLamu, which was labeled as \\"highly recommended\\" by \\"Label online\\" concerning standards, independence, controlling and transparency.  Organization With its 70,000 members KLJB is one of the biggest youth movements in Germany. The organization makes an effort in its 1,900 local groups for the rural youth' interests in church, politics and society. KLJB's members are especially youth people and young adults with 14 years or olders. In some of the diocesan associations of KLJB there is also the possibility for younger ones to be member. Starting at local level up to diocesan and federal level, over 5,000 young people are involved voluntarily in KLJB as leaders of the local groups, in activities organized by the movement and in the organs of KLJB. The federal office of KLJB is located in Bad Honnef-Rh√∂ndorf in North Rhine-Westphalia. The association is connecting with political and religious institutions and also with other associations and organizations. It is known as an expert organization for young people in rural areas. The different local and regional groups in 20 different diocesan association are helping each other to reach the aims of the organization. KLJB is member in its umbrella organization Bund der Deutschen Katholischen Jugend (BDKJ), member of the Climate-Alliance Germany and advisory member in the German Agrarb√ºndnis. Its European and global interest are represented in the international Catholic Agricultural and Rural Youth Movement (MIJARC) At state level, there is a specificity in Bavaria, where KLJB with its 26,000 members is a recognized youth association in the Bavarian farmer's association () ‚Äì beside the protestant rural youth organization and the Bavarian young farmer's association. Patron is the national saint of Switzerland, Nicholas vof Fl√ºe, whose saint's day is on 25 September. KLJB is working close together with the German Catholic Rural People's Movement (), which was founded by adult members of KLJB after their time in the youth movement.

It proposes a migration route involving watercraft, via the Kurile island chain, along the coast of Beringia and the archipelagos off the Alaskan-British Columbian coast, continuing down the coast to Central and South America. The alternative is the \\"interior route,\\" which assumes migration along an ice-free corridor between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets during the Last Glacial Maximum. The coastal migration hypothesis has been bolstered by findings such as the report that the sediments in the Port Eliza caves on Vancouver Island indicate the possibility of a survivable climate as far back 16 ka (16,000 years) in the area, while the continental ice sheets were nearing their maximum extent. However, despite such research, the hypothesis is still subject to considerable debate. Carlson,1990 in Matson and Coupland, 1995:61-61 Erlandson,Erlandson, Jon. 2002. Anatomically modern humans, maritime voyaging, and the Pleistocene colonization of the Americas. In The First Americans: The Pleistocene Colonization of the New World, edited by N. Jablonski, pp. 59-92. Memoirs of the California Academy of Sciences. San Francisco. and others have argued for a coastal migration from Alaska to the Pacific Northwest pre-11ka (before ‚âà13,000 calendar years ago) that predates the hypothesized migration of Clovis people moving south through an ice-free corridor located near the continental divide.Matson & Coupland, 1995:64 The coastal migrants may have been followed by the Clovis culture when the final retreat of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet opened migration routes between interior and coastal Alaska. A 2017 discovery on Triquet Island by an archaeological team from the University of Victoria appears to verify local First Nation oral history traditions that the island was inhabited during the ice age. A hearth excavated at the site was determined by radiocarbon dating to be between 13,613 and 14,086 years old, making it one of the oldest settlements in North America. While some archaeologists believe that the Clovis people moved south from Alaska through an ice-free corridor located between modern British Columbia and Alberta, recent dating of Clovis and similar Paleoindian sites in Alaska suggest that Clovis technology actually moved from the south into Alaska following the melting of the continental ice sheets at about 10.5 ka.Dixon 1999 Sea levels Dating the initial coastal migration is challenging because of the flooding of early settlement sites by the rise of the eustatic sea level accompanying deglaciation. Dates for sites such as ones at Ground Hog Bay in SE Alaska (10.2 ka) and Namu, about 800 km south of Ground Hog Bay near modern Bella Coola (9.7 ka) thus represent early mainland settlement above the present-day sea level after earlier waterborne migration while the sea level was lower and the coastal mainland was still glaciated. Full understanding of the initial migration requires careful reconstruction of the land and ecological resources available to the migrants in their contemporary environment. Evidence from Southeast Alaska and Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands) in British Columbia, provides some data about food and land resources during early settlement. Fedje and Christensen (1999:642) have identified several sites on Haida Gwaii that date to post 9ka. The oldest human yet found on the west coast of North America are from On Your Knees Cave, which is on Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska. The individual, a young man in his early twenties when he died, has been dated to ‚âà10,000 cal BP and isotopic analyses indicate he was raised on a diet primarily of marine foods. These data suggest human occupation when the sea level was lower than present, and that submerged archaeological sites could occur along the paleocoastline beyond the current shorelines of Haida Gwaii (Fedje & Christensen, 1999) and Southeast Alaska. Between 13 and 10.5 ka, Haida Gwaii had more than double its current land area (Fedje & Christensen, 1999:638). This area was flooded with the a rapid rise in sea level between 11 and 9 ka. (Fedje & Christensen, 1999:638). Therefore, evidence of initial human occupation on the paleocoastline of Haida Gwaii would now be below sea level. Conversely, older sites that are located near modern shorelines would have been approximately from the coast (Fedje & Christensen, 1999:638). The antiquity of the lithic scatters that Fedje and Christensen (1999) have found in intertidal zones along the Haida Gwaii coast suggests an early human occupation of the area. Fedje and Christensen (1999) support Carlson (1990), and Fladmark's (1975, 1979 & 1989) initial coastal migration model rather than the ice-free corridor model through their investigations of intertidal zones on Haida Gwaii.In Fedje & Christensen, 1999:648  The Peopling of the Americas  The timing and route of human arrival to mid-latitude North America is highly contested and both the terrestrial and coastal routes suffer from a paucity of archaeological evidence. Beringia is very difficult to access in modern day because it is now below current sea level. However, hypotheses have been made based on mitochondrial DNA research to address the question of whether or not humans left Beringia and settled mid-latitude America during the LGM or stayed in Beringia throughout the LGM. = Three- wave Model = The Three-wave model is an older model that attempts to explain the peopling of the Americas suggested by Greenberg et al. (1986). Using linguistic and genetic data as well as dental anthropology, Greenberg et al. subdivided Native Americans into three groups: Amarind, Na-Dene, and Aleut- Inuit. They explained the linguistic, anatomical, and genetic differences they found in each group as a result of separate migrations or waves out of Northeast Asia to the Americas. This model has been criticized by anthropologist Em≈ëke J.E. Szathm√°ry who thought that Greenberg's study overstated biological difference. Szathm√°ry argued that the differences between each group could be better explained by isolation rather than the three migrations. In 1977, Bonatto and Szath√°mry (1997) concluded that the presence of glaciers isolated the populations from one another, causing them to settle in Beringia rather than use it as a bridge or corridor for migration to mid-latitude America. Bonatto and Szathm√°ry suggest that after the LGM, humans actually migrated out of Beringia rather than out of Asia. = Beringian \\"Standstill\\" Hypothesis = The Beringian \\"Standstill\\" Hypothesis proposed by Tamm et al. (2007) builds off of Bonatto and Szathm√°ry's idea of migration out of Beringia after the LGM. Using mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) and computer modeling of ice sheets, Tamm et al. estimate an isolation period in Beringia of about ~10,000 years, concluding that the isolated Beringian populations spread throughout mid-latitude and South America after the LGM due to blocked access to North America before 15,000 cal BP. At the turn of the 21st century, more research began to favor the coastal migration theory over terrestrial theories for the peopling of the Americas. Paleoecological evidence suggests that travel along the coast would have been possible between 13 and 11 ka as the ice sheets were retreating.Dixon 1993, 1999; Matson & Coupland, 1995:64 The coastal region was quite hospitable by 13 ka to peoples with watercraft and a maritime adaptation. =Kelp Highway Hypothesis= Jon Erlandson and his colleaguesErlandson, J. M., M.H. Graham, B.J. Bourque, D. Corbett, J.A. Estes, & R.S. Steneck. 2007. The Kelp Highway hypothesis: marine ecology, the coastal migration theory, and the peopling of the Americas. Journal of Island and Coastal Archaeology 2:161-174. have outlined an ecological corollary to the coastal migration theory, known as the Kelp Highway Hypothesis,Erlandson, J.M., T.J. Braje, K.M. Gill, and M. Graham. 2015. Ecology of the kelp highway: did marine resources facilitate human dispersal from northeast Asia to the Americas? Journal of Island and Coastal Archaeology 10:392-411. which proposes that highly productive kelp forest ecosystems around the North Pacific coast facilitated migration of maritime peoples from northeast Asia to North America and down the Pacific Coast. This hypothesis addresses how humans could have colonized the Americas before the ice sheets retreated, allowing for terrestrial migration. Erlandson et al. (2007) suggest that coastal migrations and settlements happened in higher latitudes, such as 35-70¬∞N, where coastal ecosystems would be more productive because of geography and upwelling in the Northern Pacific Rim. The different kelps of the Pacific Rim are major contributors to the areas of productivity and biodiversity and support a wide variety of life such as marine mammals, shellfish, fish, seabirds, and edible seaweeds that would also support a coastal community of hunter-gatherers. While the benefits of kelp forests are very clear in the present day Pacific Rim, Erlandson et al. address the difficulties of understanding the ancient kelp forests as they would have existed at the end of the LGM. But, they were able to estimate where the kelp forests might have been distributed.  Archeological and Geological Evidence  Archaeological sites from the Pacific Northwest to Baja California have offered more evidence to suggest the coastal migration theory. Sites in the North Pacific have been discovered and researched to help develop a baseline of early coastal colonization data. The Arlington Springs Man is an excavation of 10,000-year-old human remains in the Channel Islands. Marine shellfish remains associated with Kelp Forests were recovered in the Channel Island sites and at other sites such as Daisy Cave and Cardwell Bluffs dated between 12,000 and 9000 cal BP. In South America, evidence of human presence as early as 12,500 cal BP was discovered at the Monte Verde site pointing to coastal migration south over inland migration as the ice sheet would not yet be retreated. Further evidence to support the coastal migration hypothesis has been found in the biological viability of regions after deglaciation. Lesnek et al. 2018 found that the deglaciation of the Pacific coastal corridor allowed for biological productivity, availability of food resources, and an accessible migration route for early colonization.  Zoo-archaeological Evidence  Further evidence of a coastal ecology sufficient to support early coastal migrants comes from zoo-archaeological finds along the Northwest coast. Goat remains as old as 12 ka have been found on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, as well as, bear remains dating to 12.5 ka in the Prince of Wales Archipelago, British Columbia. Even older remains of black and brown bear, caribou, sea birds, fish, and ringed seal have been dated from a number of caves in Southeast Alaska by paleontologist Timothy Heaton. This means that there were enough land and floral resources to support large land mammals and, theoretically, humans. Further intertidal and underwater investigations may produce sites older than 11 ka. Coastal occupation prior to 13 ka would allow for people to migrate further south and account for the early South American sites. =Watercraft= Fedje and Christensen (1999:648) also argue that the coast was likely colonized before 13 ka, largely based on watercraft evidence from Japan before 13 kaErlandson 2001, 2002; Fedje & Christensen, 1999:648 Dietary evidence from middens in Indonesia indicates the development of offshore fishing, requiring watercraft, between 35 and 40 ka. Sea-going cultures were mobile in the island-rich environment off the late Pleistocene coast of east Asia, facilitating the spread of marine technology and skills through the Philippines, up the Ryukyu chain, to Japan. Warming of the climate after about 16 ka (although glaciation would remain) could have provided an impetus for seaborne migration up the Kurile island chain towards North America, through some combination of a more hospitable climate and increased ocean productivity. Although no boats have been recovered from early Pacific Coast archaeological sites, this may be due to poor preservation of organic materials and the inundation of coastal areas mentioned above. We can still infer water travel based on the presence of artifacts made by humans found at island sites. Anecdotal evidence comes from the surviving Bella Bella oral tradition, as recorded by Franz Boas in 1898. \\"In the beginning there was nothing but water and ice and a narrow strip of shoreline.\\"Boas, 1898:883 in Fedje & Christensen, 1999:635 Some believe this story describes the environment of the Northwest Coast during the last deglaciation. =Migration south= Further south, California's Channel Islands have also produced evidence for early seafaring by Paleoindian (or Paleocoastal) peoples. Santa Rosa and San Miguel islands, for instance, have produced 11 sites dating to the Terminal Pleistocene, including the Arlington Man site dated to ‚âà11 ka and Daisy Cave occupied about 10.7 ka. Jon Erlandson and his colleagues have also identified several early shell middens located near sources of chert, which was used to make stone tools.Erlandson, J.M., T.C. Rick, T.J. Braje, M. Casperson, B. Culleton, B. Fulfrost, T. Garcia, D. Guthrie, N. Jew, D. Kennett, M.L. Moss, L.. Reeder, C. Skinner, J. Watts, & L. Willis. 2011. Paleoindian seafaring, maritime technologies, and coastal foraging on California‚Äôs Channel Islands. Science 441:1181-1185. These quarry/workshop sites have been dated between about 10 and 10.5 ka and contain crescents and finely made stemmed projectile points probably used to hunt birds and sea mammals, respectively. Significantly, the Channel Islands were not connected to the mainland coast during the Quaternary, so maritime peoples contemporary with the Clovis and Folsom complexes in the interior had to have seaworthy boats to colonize them. The Channel Islands have also produced the earliest fishhooks yet found in the Americas, bone bipoints (gorges) that date between about 8.5 and 9 ka (10,000 and 9500 calendar years). Even further south, the Monte Verde site in Chile has become accepted as the earliest settlement in South America, dating to at least 14,500 years ago. This is believed to indicate migration through northern coastal regions before that date. The Monte Verde site produced the remains of nine types of seaweeds, including kelp.

Following their resistance against foreign authority, the Dagbamba tribesmen met and launched an attack on the heavily armed German Schutztruppe and Askari paramilitary police accompanying the Lieutenant Valentin von Massow on his way to their capital at the village of Adibo, who had been sent by the German colonial administration to quell the rebellion. The Dagbamba fighters suffered significant losses on the second day of the battle and yielded after their capital Yendi was razed to the ground on December 4 1896. Defeat of the Dagbamba enabled the German Empire to complete establishing the Togoland protectorate, which encompassed the eastern part of the Kingdom of Dagbon. The western part of the Kingdom was released to the British and incorporated into the British Empire. Written accounts of the incursion primarily come from the personal letters and diaries of von Massow to his mother, as well as his official reports addressed to the Governor of Lome under the colonial department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin. Dagba≈ã drummer storytellers maintain a slightly different oral account of the event. Background Before 1850, German missionaries had become well-established among the southern tribes of present day Ghana and Togo, but Germany first established a formal protectorate along the coast of West Africa on July 5 1884. They continued their advance northwards and from 1884 established the Togoland protectorate as a discontinuous part of the Deutsch-Westafrika protectorate that included Cameroon. Their advance was influenced by the need to expand agricultural plantations, road and railway lines; and to exact forced labour for those purposes. Factors that facilitated their movement into the hinterlands included the construction of a port at Lom√©, installation of the Kamina Funkstation radio communications transmitter, and the minimal resistance posed by the tribes they encountered such as the Ewe people, who mostly settled as fragmented clans. By 1890, the German expeditions had ventured into the savanna regions of present day Ghana and Togo, where they encountered the more formidable Dagbamba warriors.

She was the first American to win the Trans Am. She also set the overall course record with her time on the Baja Divide route. Personal Wilcox grew up in Anchorage, Alaska. She started biking in 2008, at age 20, when she and her then boyfriend, Nicholas Carman, decided to tour the world. Working stints to collect money, the two set out on a bicycle tour of over thirty countries. They started in North America, then traveled in Eastern Europe, the middle east, and Africa, logging over 100,000 miles. In their spare time, the two, along with Lael's mother, Dawn, teach biking skills and repair bicycles for elementary school children in Anchorage. They also have a program to collect and provide donated bikes to schoolchildren. Wilcox graduated from the University of Puget Sound in 2008 with degrees in natural science and French literature.

In 2018 she began the Lael Rides Alaska Women's Scholarship. She has general sponsorships from Specialized and Revelate Designs. Racing Lael first became interested in racing in 2014 when she and Carman were in Israel. The pair heard about and entered the Holyland Challenge, a 1000-mile unsupported race across the country. She was both the youngest rider and the only woman. She led the race by 25 miles the first day, and although she did not win the race, she was firmly focused on endurance racing. =Trans Am= In 2016, Wilcox participated in the 4,400 mile Trans Am Bike Race that crosses the United States from west to east. As a small woman dressed in non-cycling clothes and with very little road-racing experience, she was not expected to compete, much less win. She averaged 235 miles per day for 18 days, averaging less than 5 hours of sleep per night. On the final morning, she trailed Steffen Streich by 40 miles. That morning, Streich awoke and mistakenly started riding west. Wilcox met Streich in Bumpass, Virginia. Streich suggested they ride to the finish together, and Wilcox responded, \\"This is a race\\" and sprinted the final 130 miles to the coast to become the first woman and the first American to win the race. Wilcox sprinted the final hours to win the race in 18 days and ten minutes. =Tour Divide= In 2015, Wilcox, still considered relatively inexperienced at road racing, broke the women's record on the Tour Divide by more than two days. She covered the 2,745 mile race in 17 days, 1 hour and 51 minutes in spite of stopping off for an emergency room visit due to a respiratory infection. =Baja Divide= In 2015, Wilcox set the women's record for the fastest time on the Baja Divide route, which runs from San Diego, California through San Jose del Cabo and on to La Paz, Mexico.

The film was released in India on 16 March 2018.It was dubbed into hindi as mera badla revenge 3 Plot Aryan (Gokul Suresh) is a doctor whose love interest is Jennifer (Niranjana Anoop). He is arrested by Kerala Police for the murder of Minister Chandy(Alencier Ley Lopez), but claims he is innocent and wrongly accused. His life changes when Rajeev (Unni Mukundan), the central police officer investigating his case, comes into it. Rajeev investigates thoroughly to find that Aryan who was new to the city was appointed in a leading hospital as per recommendation from a priest who was close to its owner. Also, Aryan's love interest Jenny is the granddaughter of the deceased minister. Her father Jacob Chandy and her mother Daisy had been separated. Rajeev makes a detailed account of all events on the day of minister Chandy's death. The cause of death was allegedly a deadly chemical which was found in his body. Rajeev meets Aryan in jail and assures that he would be set free if he is innocent. Later, Rajeev meets Jenny and narrates a different story, which starts off with Rajeev and his assistant being handed over the investigation of a case regarding tribal families in a forest village. He meets a girl Karthika (Miya) and, after a set of funny events, falls in love with her. However, he understands that Karthika is none other than the famous journalist Vaigha Devi, who deals with social crimes against tribal people. A factory which produced illegal medicines had been testing these on the village people with the help of Bhadran, a rowdy. Rajeev understands more of these issues before his investigation ends. Later, Karthika wishes to open up to Rajeev on her love. However, at the meeting place she is welcomed by Minister Chandy and his son Jacob. It is revealed that Chandy is the one behind illegal medicine production for the village. Karthika has personal vengeance towards Chandy as he murdered her parents. She is stabbed by Jacob and left to die. Rajeev who arrives later finds her murdered, and attempts to take her to the hospital but gets hit by Bhadran and becomes unconscious. Rajeev who ends his flashback tells to a shattered Jenny that her father might have accused the innocent Aryan so that he can create an emotional note about minister Chandy's death. Jenny goes back to her mother Daisy who is a brilliant criminal lawyer and apologizes for hating her. In the court session, Adv. Daisy brilliantly proves that Aryan is innocent and bails him out, also proving that Jacob has purposefully accused Aryan with the help of a corrupt Police inspector Satish. Later Jacob's car suffers anonymous gunshots which arouses curiosities. Rajeev is called to Jacob's guest house situated at an island, wherein Jacob tells him that he had kidnapped Aryan also. He had planned to kill both of them so as to create a new story and deceive the public. Rajeev laughs at him and reveals certain things unknown to Jacob. In major twist, it turns out that minister Chandy was actually murdered by Aryan with the help of none other than Rajeev. Rajeev reveals that on the day of the murder, he in the disguise of a male nurse had replaced the injection drug meant for minister Chandy with a life-threatening one so that the minister would be injected by it. After revealing these facts to a terror stricken Jacob, Rajeev also tells him that the murder was done to avenge the murder of Karthika, who was Rajeev's love interest and also Aryan's elder sister. After revealing all the truths, Rajeev shoots and kills Jacob. Aryan escapes and Rajeev meets the media folk and tells them about the minister's murder. Jacob's murder case is handed over to Rajeev (who claims he is the only one to spot the so-called murderer). The film ends with Rajeev and Aryan all set to kill Bhadran who murdered Karthika.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History Ionia was first settled in 1833 by Samuel Dexter, who recruited a group of about 63 people from New York to join him. Aided by the local Ojibwe, they settled in and cleared fields, then built log cabins and soon a sawmill. Other commercial activities soon followed, with a furniture factory and brewery active by the late 1830s. In 1835/36, Ionia became the official county seat, and the federal land office was established in the area in 1836. These led to the opening of hotels and stores in the growing community. The village itself was first platted in 1841, including what is now this commercial district on the northern side. The oldest structure in the district - the St. John's parish house - dates to this time period. The railroad reached Ionia in 1859, hastening commercial activity. This included an increased demand for Ionia sandstone, and by the 1870s there were eight hotels in the city, serving travelers arriving by railroad. Much of the building stock in the district was built starting around this time, as Ionia grew in the late nineteenth century. Description West Main between Kidd and Depot, looking west The Ionia Downtown Commercial Historic District covers nearly all of Ionia's central business district, and includes buildings which were constructed primarily in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Eighty-five structures are included in the district, of which seventy contribute to the historic nature of the district. These buildings are primarily commercial, although the district does include some residential, religious, and governmental buildings. The commercial blocks stand side-by-side, directly on the sidewalk line, and are generally two- or three-story structures, constructed of red brick or the locally quarried sandstone. The east end of the district is an institutional area, containing the county courthouse, city hall, post office, and multiple church buildings. All of these are architecturally significant, and contribute to the historic nature of the district. The most significant structures in the district include: * The Ionia Armory (439 W. Main), is a two-story red brick structure built in 1908-09. It is built in a picturesque, crenellated English Gothic style, with an arched corbel table at the cornice level and a corbelled turret window located at the corner of the building. The original upper portion of the tower has been removed. * The three commercial buildings at 409, 411, and 413 West Main Street are all Italianate structures constructed in the late 1880s or early 1890s. Although each is of an individual design, they all retain much of their original cast-iron storefronts. * The commercial building at 340 West Main Street is a two-story structure constructed in about 1890. It is notable for its handsome facade of pink Ionia sandstone. * The Italianate commercial block at 332-336 West Main Street was constructed in about 1885, and is a two-story, three-storefront block with a buff brick facade, metal cornice, and ornate metal window heads. * The Silver-Graff Building (313-317 W. Main) was constructed in 1894. It is a two-story, two storefront building with a rock-face, random ashlar facade. Two second-story bay windows located at either end of the facade rise into octagonal towers with distinctive bell-shaped roofs. The bay windows, towers, cornices, and parapets are all of metal. * The Ionia County National Bank Building (302 W. Main) is a two-story NeoClassical structure builtin 1914, with a temple front having two-story limestone columns in a full pediment and entablature. * St. John's Episcopal Church (120 N. Kidd) is an 1882 Victorian Gothic structure, with a square plan tower and unusual Victorian styling. * The Ionia County Courthouse (100 W.

The old parish was united with Houston in 1760 although the church saw occasional use until 1771. The ruins of the kirk are a scheduled monument and the surrounding graveyard is a Listed Building. The ruins stand some west of the centre of Houston, just off the Kilallan Road. History The kirk and access lane Various other spellings are used for the old parish (Kilfillan, Kylhelan, Killilellin, Kyllinan, Kilenan, Kilellan and Killallan),Houstoniana, Page 22 Kilallan will be used here for consistency. The location was the circa seventh century site of the cell of a St Fillan, probably a follower of Saint Columba, whose was held in such reverence that his arm bone was one of the holy relics paraded in front of the Scots Army at Bannockburn. His name in Gaelic means 'little wolf' and his feast day was 9 January. The cult of St Fillan's was introduced by Irish immigrants and the church one of several that Walter fitz Alan, Steward of Scotland gifted to Paisley Abbey in 1169, a foundation that he himself established. Several other St Fillan's sites with churches, wells, seats, etc. exist in elsewhere in Scotland. St Fillan is the patron saint of the mentally ill.Cope, Page 118 =Covenanters= In 1781 it is recorded that the kirk was being used for services by the Cameronians, a radical faction of Scottish Covenanters from Sanquhar who followed the teachings of Richard Cameron. The followers were also known also as \\"Society Men\\", \\"Sanquharians,\\" and even \\"Hillmen\\" as they used remote sites to hold Conventicles, for example it is known that the isolated Kirkbride Kirk in Nithsdale was un-roofed in an attempt to deter its use by Covenanters.Snoddy, Page 171 The old kirk and churchyard The present parish of Houston and Killellan dates from 1771 when the two parishes of Houston and Killellan were joined. The former parish kirk in the nearby hamlet of Kilallan was known as the Church of St Fillan which gives the hamlet its name. The former church building was left redundant by the unification and was abandoned and un-roofed some time after 1791.Snoddy, Page 169 The Barochan Aisle on the north side of the kirk is the burial place of the Flemings of near by Barochan Castle, feudal superiors and heritors of the kirk. The ruin carries two datestones, the oldest dated 1635 however the present building is much older dating back to at least the 10th or 11th century, affirmed by the ancient rectangular shape of the kirk. This scheduled monument is now in the care of the Kilallan Kirk Preservation Trust following its donation in 2005 by the Elderslie Estates. An annual service at St Fillan's is held amongst the ruins by the minister and congregation of the united parish. The entrance to the old kirk and churchyard. North and south facing doors may have been the original design in the present building however 17th and 18th century alterations resulted in doors and windows being blocked up with old tombstones, etc. and a new door dated 1635 located in the south wall reflecting post-reformation protocols. A square hole to the left of the door marks the site of the old parish jougs that were stolen, discovered by chance and donated to a local museum who have yet to locate them. A story is told of a woman of short stature who having committed some misdemeanor had the jougs placed around her neck so that she would suffer public humiliation, however she fell off the box she was made to stand on and the short chain resulted in her strangulation. The church bell bears the inscription \\"CAROLVS HOG ME FECIT 1618\\" although it was recast in 1844. It was removed from the kirk and hung in a tree at Barochan House, home of the Flemings of the Fleming Aisle, seeing daily use. The bell is now kept in the parish church and rung once a year before the annual service on the first Sunday in July, the saint's feast day. A 6th century bronze Byzantine coin and a pewter crucifix of medieval date were found in amongst the ruins of the church. A part of a knight's gravestone, bearing part of a sword, has been found built into the church walls. The abandoned church saw some degree of maintenance over the years and in 1955 the walls were in good condition and showed signs of being cared for. The church interior was used for burials in the 19th century with the addition of the Barochan Aisle, iron railings partitioning off the east end and plaques mounted on the walls in several places. However the effect of the elements in this exposed location together with plant growth was causing serious damage and an extensive restoration project was undertaken and completed by 2014. =Churchyard= The graveyard surrounding the church was still in use as late as 1856. The old font is recorded to have been built into the boundary wall of the cemetery. Grave recording has identified 58 grave monuments and two possible grave footings and resistivity work located an earlier wall that was oval and therefore in keeping with ancient churchyards. =The manse= The church's manse, now Kilallan Farm or House, immediately adjacent to St Fillan's, is considered to be the oldest existing dwellinghouse in Renfrewshire. It had a stable and a byre now converted and was sold around 1771 by the heritors, its condition being recorded as 'bad' in the first Statistical Account. It had a typical loupin stane much used by the minister of the old kirk to mount his horse.Snoddy, Page 168 In 1950 a visitor recorded that the old glebe field was exceptionally fertile in comparison with other parcels of land in the area and was traditionally regarded as being the old kitchen garden of the pre-Reformation priests.Snoddy, Page 170 =Ministers= Plaque commemorating the Rev James Hutcheson. A plaque on the outside of the south wall commemorates the Rev James Hutcheson who served here from 1649 to his death aged 81 in 1706. He is notable also through his involvement in the Christian Shaw or Paisley witches affair which took place in 1697. Christian Shaw, aged 11, gave evidence that led to eight people being accused of witchcraft. It is reported that Shaw had been \\"betwitched\\" by the defendants and was exhibiting behaviours including flying, and was vomiting coal, hair, wool, bent pins, etc. Seven were hanged as a result of Christian's testimony, three men and four women, whilst the eighth accused person was found dead in his cell. James Hutcheson was well known throughout Scotland for his ardent oppositions to witchcraft and a week before the trial he preached an hour long sermon in Paisley Abbey in which he vehemently condemned and called for action against all the aspects of pagan practices to an audience that contained all the judges, jurors and many of the witnesses at the forthcoming trials. The Rev Peter Dale was minister of the joint parishes of Houston and Kilallan from his induction on 5th September1843 until his death on 11 December 1856 as recorded on a marble plaque on an interior wall. St Fillan's Seat St Fillan's Seat Also known as St Fillan's Chair or Pulpit (NS 38396892) this whinstone block is located against the drystone dyke on the western side of the lane. It is a natural boulder that faces south and overlooks the kirk and a field, in the corner of which stands St Fillan's Well. A circular hollow forms a south facing seat and to the right hand side is a smaller oval hollow. Local tradition records that St Fillan sat in this chair, preached and baptised converts and babies with holy water from the cup that had been collected from the nearby well. It is also said to cure rheumatism with the afflicted person first sitting on the seat and then being hauled down the hill by their feet to conclude the cure, although this may be a confusion with another Scottish St Fillan's Seat. Old engravings show that the soil level at the area of the seat has been significantly eroded through rainfall and the actions of cattle and horses.Brotchie, Page 38 St Fillan's Well St Fillan's Holy Well. St Fillan's holy well has probably been venerated since pre-Christian times and the spring water used by the saint himself. The water flows from beneath a large isolated rock that may have fallen from above and flows into a now ruinous round-shaped brick and stone basin. The holy water was thought to miraculously cure ailing children or those with rickets; pieces of cloth and rags being tied to overhanging branches at the well as votive offerings. The radical Calvinist minister, James Hutcheson, had the well filled with stones in around 1690, however this was later cleared out as the water continued to flow and it was even piped to the old farm for domestic use that may explain the current presence of brickwork at the site.Snoddy, Page 172 The waters of the clootie well were used for baptisms at St Fillan Kirk and traditionally at St Fillan's Seat.Cope, Page 118 Branches used to hang over the well however no trees grow here at present. Old engravings indicate that the well had a circular wall with three courses of stone in the 19th century.Snoddy, Page 172 A drawing of 1923 shows the three courses of stone or brick as a 'U' shape pierced by an overflow pipe that passed the holy waters into an old rectangular porcelain sink set into the ground. The drawing shows a shrub growing across the boulder behind the well.Brotchie, Page 39 The water were said to be used to cure 'back-gane' bairns, that is those who were not thriving. The Kneelins Stane It is recorded that a form of Petrosomatoglyph called the 'Kneelins Stane' lay somewhere to the north of the old kirk, some distance away and it carried two larger and one smaller depression that had been created by pilgrims who knelt here to pray to the saint and over the years their knees and staffs wore these depressions into this large flat rock set into the moorland.Houstoniana, Page 23 The Barochan Cross After being moved by the Laird of BarochanSnoddy, Page 178 the monument is now kept in Paisley Abbey. It is an ornately carved Celtic cross dating from the 8th or 9th century cross stood quite close to Kilallan (NS40586937), near to Barochan Castle on the site of a track way that once led to Dumbarton Castle, the seat of the old Kingdom of Strathclyde. The carving is of the Govan school of carving. Cartographic evidence and place names The Barochan Aisle and the church interior. As stated a number of other 'St Fillan' place names exist in Scotland including wells, caves, churches, a village and other natural features. The identity and history of St Fillan has been lost in the mists of time and the name may refer to several different personages at different periods in history. Various spellings are used for the old parish and kirk on old maps and other documents such as Kilfillan, Kylhelan, Killilellin, Kyllinan, Kilenan, Kilellan and Killallan.Houstoniana, Page 22 Additionally Killellen is clearly marked with two buildings, probably representing the church and the manse or vicarage on Timothy Pont's map of circa 1560 to 1614. North, West, Mid and East Barfillan farms are recorded in 1800. A Crosslee Hill is located nearby suggesting a causal link and as stated the Barochan Cross once stood in the vicinity.

He was Mayor of Waterford, a member of each of the three Protectorate Parliaments, and the last Chief Justice of Munster. Little seems to be known of his origins or his early life. He is first heard of as a captain in the Cromwellian Army. After the triumph of the Cromwellian cause in Ireland in 1650-51 he was awarded several confiscated Royalist estates. He became a substantial landowner in County Tipperary and County Kilkenny; later he moved to Waterford. He became prominent in the public life of Waterford city, and served as its Mayor in 1661-2. He was almost certainly a qualified barrister, and served in several judicial and quasi-judicial offices. The Provincial Court of Munster, which had lapsed during the political turmoil of the 1640s, was briefly revived with the regicide John Cook as Chief Justice and Halsey as second justice. He sat with Cook on a special court at Mallow to hear pleas against transplantation to Connacht by citizens of Cork, Youghal and Kinsale, and he sat in 1656 on the special court which sat at Athlone to hear similar pleas. He was commissioner for revenue for the district of Waterford. He acted as Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper in the Four Courts, although the office had already been granted to George Carleton. He sat in each of the three Protectorate Parliaments as member for the newly combined constituency of Waterford city and Clonmel. He was one of the \\"kinglings\\" i.e. the party in Parliament which unsuccessfully urged Oliver Cromwell to accept the English Crown in 1657. Given his record of unswerving loyalty to Cromwell, and in particular his involvement in the effort to persuade him to accept the Crown, it is remarkable that his career continued to flourish after the Restoration of Charles II. Despite attacks on his loyalty to the Crown by his political enemies, he seems to have been generally regarded as a man of integrity. This may partly account for his survival: in any case Charles II adopted a conscious policy of reconciliation with his former enemies. Halsey seems also to have enjoyed the patronage of Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery, the new Lord President of Munster, whose family were the dominant political force in Munster. In addition to being Mayor of Waterford he returned to the Provincial Court of Munster as Chief Justice and remained in that office until the Court was abolished in 1672. His date of death is not recorded. References *Barnard,T.C. Cromwellian Ireland - English Government and Reform in Ireland 1649-1660 Oxford University Press 1975 *Burke, William P.

History In late 1918, the Cultural-Educational Department of the Association of Consumer Societies of Azerbaijan decided to open a public library. Providing the collection for the new library proved to be a difficult task since there was no large-scale publication in the country at the time. The library's initial collection included a few hundred items mostly acquired from personal book collections and its readership was very limited. In 1921, it was named after Mirza Alekper Sabir in commemoration of the tenth anniversary of his death. At this time, with the exception of limited resources in Azeri, most published materials were in Persian, Arabic and Turkish. The library was founded at 13 Verkhnyaya Priyutskaya Street (present-day Shamil Azizbeyov Street). Later it was moved to its present location in the 1904 baroque mansion which once belonged to oil industrialist Ambartsum Melikov and was designed by architect Vartan Sarkisov. By 1929, the library contained 12,300 items and had 4,000 readers, included an association of women readers establish to promote library services among newly emancipated Azerbaijani women. In 1938, the library became the first establishment in Azerbaijan to train professional librarians. In 1941, it became the first library in the country to have a bibliographic reference department.

Moore FmedSci, FRS (born 10 February 1946) is an Emeritus Professor of Auditory Perception in the University of Cambridge and an Emeritus Fellow of Wolfson College, Cambridge. His research focuses on psychoacoustics, audiology, and the development and assessment of hearing aids (signal processing and fitting methods). Moore is a fellow of the Royal Society, the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Acoustical Society of America, the Audio Engineering Society, the British Society of Audiology, the Association for Psychological Science, and the Belgian Society of Audiology, and the British Society of Hearing Aid Audiologists. He has written or edited 20 books and over 730 scientific papers and book chapters.  Biography = Education = Moore studied Natural Sciences at St Catharine‚Äôs College, Cambridge, obtaining his BA in 1968. In 1971 he was awarded a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology on the topic of Pitch Perception. = Career = Moore was a Lecturer in Psychology at the University of Reading from 1971 to 1977, spending the year 1973-74 as a Fulbright-Hays Senior Scholar and Visiting Professor at the Department of Psychology, Brooklyn College of the City University of New York. In 1977 he was appointed University Lecturer in Experimental Psychology at the University of Cambridge where he was subsequently appointed Reader (1989) and Professor (1995). He became Emeritus Professor in 2014. He was appointed as Fellow of Wolfson College in 1983 and is now an Emeritus Fellow . Moore has been an Associate Editor of the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, Auditory Neuroscience, Hearing Research, The International Journal of Audiology, Otology and Neuro-Otology, and Trends in Hearing. He is President of the Association of Independent Hearing Healthcare Professionals (UK).  Research  In his early career in the 1970's, Moore was mainly interested in fundamental research on loudness and pitch perception, masking effects, and speech recognition. He started to consider the practical aspects and potential applications of this research in the 1980's with his work on a 2-channel compression hearing aid. Other examples of practical applications include the development of a new loudness model that eventually became an international (ISO) standard, and the implementation of models of sound quality applicable to mobile telephones and other devices with Nokia. Moore has written or edited several influential books on hearing. His text book An Introduction to the Psychology of Hearing has been cited over 5600 times and has been translated into Japanese, Polish, Korean, and Chinese. Other books include Cochlear hearing Loss and Auditory Processing of Temporal Fine Structure: Effects of Age and Hearing Loss. = Pitch perception = Moore was one of the first researchers to present convincing evidence for the role of phase locking (the synchronization of nerve spikes to individual cycles of the filtered stimulus in the cochlea) in the perception of pitch. He showed that the ability of human listeners to detect small changes in frequency of brief tones was too good to be accounted for by a place mechanism of pitch for frequencies up to about 4 kHz. Together with Stephan Ernst he later showed that the ability to detect small changes in frequency worsened with increasing frequency from 2 to 8 kHz, consistent with the roll-off in the precision of phase-locking information at high frequencies, and then reached a plateau, consistent with a transition to a place mechanism. Together with Aleksander Sek he showed that phase locking to the temporal fine structure of complex tones contributes to the perception of pitch up to higher frequencies than previously assumed and that the detection of frequency modulation for low modulation rates also probably depends on phase locking. = Loudness perception and modelling = Moore together with Brian Glasberg, Thomas Baer and Michael Stone developed a model for predicting the loudness of sounds by extending and modifying the earlier models of Fletcher and Munson and of Zwicker and Scharf. The model proposed by Moore and co-workers formed the basis for an American National Standard and an ISO standard. An extension of the model to deal with time-varying sounds is under consideration as an ISO standard (ISO532-3, 2020). The loudness model of Moore and colleagues has been extended to predict loudness for people with hearing loss and this has been used to develop methods of fitting hearing aids. = Hearing aid design and fitting = Moore collaborated in the development and evaluation of multi-channel compression hearing aids intended to compensate for the loudness recruitment experienced by most hearing-impaired people. He and his colleagues developed a dual-time-constant automatic gain control system that has been widely used in hearing aids and cochlear implants. = Diagnostic tests of hearing = Moore and colleagues developed the Threshold Equalizing Noise (TEN) test for diagnosing dead regions in the cochlea; these are regions with very few or no functioning inner hair cells, synapses or neurons. The outcomes of the TEN test are relevant to the fitting of hearing aids and cochlear implants. The TEN test has been incorporated in the audiometers of several major manufacturers. Brian Moore also contributed to the development of tests for assessing monaural and binaural sensitivity to the temporal fine structure of sounds. These tests have been widely used in research and clinical studies. = Auditory scene analysis = Moore and colleagues were among the first to demonstrate the role of harmonicity in auditory scene analysis: simultaneous sinewaves that form a harmonic series are heard as a single sound object, but if a single sinewave is mistuned slightly from the harmonic series it ‚Äúpops out‚Äù as a separate sound object. Moore and colleagues also showed that for rapid sequences of pure tones with alternating frequencies, the fission boundary (the frequency separation between successive tones at which they can no longer be heard as two separate streams) is constant across a wide range of centre frequencies when expressed on the ERBN-number scale developed in Moore‚Äôs laboratory. = Effects of hearing loss and age on speech perception = Moore and colleagues have conducted several studies examining the relationship between psychoacoustic abilities and speech perception by people with cochlear hearing loss and older people. They have shown that difficulties in speech perception are at least partly linked to reduced sensitivity to the temporal fine structure of sounds.

The reserve includes an education and information centre, remains of the extinct Solitaire and giant tortoise species, and the only remaining endemic species of the island - the Rodrigues Fruit Bat (Pteropus rodricensis), Rodrigues Fody (Foudia flavicans) and Rodrigues Warbler (Acrocephalus rodericanus). It has several viewing points over the eastern part of the island, and a wide range of rare endemic plants. The reserve is also the only remaining habitat of the endemic Rodrigues Aloe (Aloe lomatophylloides). Management and restoration work Endemic vegetation at Grande Montagne The reserve is run by the national NGO, the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation (MWF). The MWF and the Rodrigues Forestry Services have been conducting restoration work in the reserve since the 1980s. The visitor is now able to enjoy areas of maturing forest while witnessing other more recently restored areas or view restoration underway. Around 84% of the 25.5 ha fenced area at Grande Montagne has been restored to date and the aim of MWF is to complete the initial restoration of this reserve within the next few years. Over 156,516 plants have been planted in the reserve by MWF so far and 40 rare Rodriguan plant species are successfully conserved on Grande Montagne. The forest is a habitat to the surviving endemic animals and insects of Rodrigues. From about only 30 birds, the population of the Rodrigues Fody reached 8,000 individuals in 2010, whilst that of the Rodrigues Warbler increased to over 4,000 individuals over the same period, in part due to the habitat restoration on Grande Montagne. Visiting and public participation Forest trail This project involves the local community, providing employment to restoration labourers from the nearby villages and organising ‚Äòrestoration working days‚Äô with grassroots associations to sensitise and empower the local people in habitat restoration. The reserve is included in the Rodrigues Environmental Education Programme where students visit and are taught about the reserve and its importance. The reserve is also open to the public for visits, and in 2013 the Rodrigues Regional Assembly approved plans for the MWF to conduct ecotourism activities in this nature reserve. It runs guided tours and the routes through the reserve contain information signs.Restoration projectFauna and Florahttps://www.travelactive.nl/sites/default/files/wl- mauritius-flora-fauna-rodrigues.pdf External links * Grande Montagne website * Grande Montagne Nature Reserve - Flyer * Grande Montagne Nature Reserve - Field Guide References Nature Reserves of Rodrigues ","title":"Grande Montagne Nature Reserve"},{"id":"56476847","text":"Yelena Ilyina (born 5 May 1967) is a Soviet speed skater.

Priority consideration for a wild-card applicant goes to spellers who have already made a prior national bee, followed by older spellers reaching their eligibility limit. Since wild-card entries do not have a regional sponsor, they have to pay a $750 entry fee as well their own travel, food, and lodging.

The rule change may also be related to cost cutting in the newspaper industry. Though there are now well over 200 regional bees across the United States (and a few abroad), some regional bee sponsors (which traditionally have been newspapers) may decide to drop their sponsorship, causing regional bee cancellations if a new sponsor cannot be found.

She previously played three seasons at , after being drafted to the club at the 2017 draft. Early life and state football Dargan grew up in Melbourne with a family who love Australian rules football, kicking a ball around the backyard with her older brother, Matt. Dargan started out as a basketballer, before playing junior football for Pascoe Vale in division one of the Northern Football League, excelling as a mid-sized forward. Ahead of 2015, she joined Calder Cannons in the TAC Cup and played senior football with them for three years, being touted as a superstar. While playing with Calder Cannons, she also represented Vic Metro for 3 years. In 2015, she helped Vic Metro win the 2015 AFL Youth Girls National Championships title, scoring a goal in the Grand Final at Bendigo Bank Stadium, where they beat Queensland by seven points. This followed her two goals against Queensland in their opening match preceding it. In 2016 she was part of the Vic Metro team that won the 2016 AFL Youth Girls National Championships title. In 2017, Dargan was named one of Vic Metro's best in their opening loss to Vic Country, but due to this loss they lost the 2017 AFL Women's Under 18 Championships title to Vic Country despite winning their remaining games. In April 2018, Calder Cannon's coach, Alicia Eva, labelled Dargan as a \\"special kind of player\\" and predicted her being drafted to an AFLW club. AFL Women's career Dargan was drafted by Collingwood with their third selection and twentieth overall in the 2017 AFL Women's draft. Collingwood's coach, Wayne Siekman, said \\"she is clean off the ground, has a good change of pace and knows where the goals are.\\" Her selection defined her as a bolter, having not being invited to the combine or the draft itself. She made her debut in the eight point loss to Carlton at Ikon Park in the opening round of the 2018 season. In the winter of 2018, she played three games for Collingwood's VFL Women's (VFLW) team, before rupturing her Lisfranc ligament in her left foot, which required a long period of rest and rehabilitation. At the beginning she was upset not being able to play, but looking back she appreciated being able to see the coaches' box angle of the game which helped develop her knowledge. In round 2 of the 2019 season, Dargan kicked her first professional goal against Melbourne, which was Collingwood's first AFLW goal at the club's spiritual home, Victoria Park. In round 4 of the season, she was nominated for the AFL Women's Rising Star award, following her move to the midfield and her performance in Collingwood's nine point loss to Greater Western Sydney. She finished the game with a career-high 16 disposals, as well as laying six tackles and kicking a goal. She was surprised by the nomination, but honoured and happy to see her hard work pay off. Dargan played a key role for Collingwood in the 2019 season. In April 2019, she re-committed to Collingwood, alongside Brittany Bonnici, Ruby Schleicher, Erica Fowler, Sophie Alexander, Eliza Hynes, and captain Steph Chiocci.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History Ionia was first settled in 1833 by Samuel Dexter, who recruited a group of about 63 people from New York to join him. Aided by the local Ojibwe, they settled in and cleared fields, then built log cabins and soon a sawmill. What is now the Ionia Historic District was at first just a scattering of small houses. In 1839 the United States Land Office was transferred to Ionia, and in 1859 the railroad came through the town. Along with other commercial enterprises, these made Ionia a prosperous settlement, and the rapid growth led to prominent members of the community constructing homes in the district just east of the downtown. Among the most significant residents who established homes in the district are John C. Blanchard, the first president of the village of Ionia, Frederick Hall, Ionia's first mayor in 1873, George W. Webber, an Ionia entrepreneur and lumberman, Captain Lucius Mills, a local contractor, and Fred W. Green, two-term Governor of Michigan. Three of these houses - the John C. Blanchard House, the Frederick Hall House (now the Hall- Fowler Memorial Library), and the Lovell-Webber House are individually listed on the National Register. Although some of the early structures in the district are of the mid-nineteenth century Greek Revival style, the most characteristic type is the later Italianate variety, which predominates in the neighborhood, showing the bulk of the district was built up in the later nineteenth century. Later twentieth century structures are also in the neighborhood, but tend to be more modest in scale than the earlier houses. Description The Ionia Historic District is located to the east of downtown Ionia. It contains 197 structures, of which 188 contribute to the historical nature of the neighborhood. All but seven of these were built as residential structure; the remaining are churches or commercial buildings. The houses are substantially Italianate in design, although some examples of Greek Revival, Eastlake, Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, and bungalow architectures are also in the neighborhood. The streets are narrow and the houses well set back, giving the neighborhood a spacious feel.

It was produced by Everett Rosenthal, with a screenplay by Mike St. Clair from a story by Aubrey Wisberg, and directed by Nick Webster.  Summary  The United States launches three astronauts on a mission to land on Mars at around the same time that the Soviet Union launches its own secret Mars mission. On their way to Mars, the American astronauts encounter the drifting bodies of two Soviet cosmonauts, who they realize must have been buried in space. The American spacecraft lands safely on Mars, albeit farther away than planned from its accompanying supply capsule. The astronauts set out toward the supply capsule, leaving a line of balloons to mark their trail. They discover that there is a hole burned into the supply capsule's hull and that the balloons have been removed. They also discover a third cosmonaut, standing frozen in a state of suspended animation, who revives once brought inside the American spacecraft. The astronauts then encounter a strange creature (called a \\"Polarite\\"), which threatens them but which they neutralize by firing beam weapons at its single red eye. Ground controllers advise the astronauts that the Polarites seem to be robots controlled by an external influence. An alien sphere appears on the Martian surface; when Duncan, one of the astronauts, approaches the sphere he is dragged inside by a mysterious force and killed. The sphere is emitting a force field which prevents the American spacecraft from taking off. An attempt to escape by using booster rockets from the supply capsule fails. The cosmonaut tells the Americans that the sphere can be deactivated by destroying a disc inside it. Nick Grant, the American geologist-astronaut, volunteers to do so and succeeds at the cost of his life. Col. Mike Blaiswick, the surviving American astronaut, and the Soviet cosmonaut escape Mars in the American spacecraft and learn that Blaiswick's wife is pregnant.  Cast  * Darren McGavin: Col. Mike Blaiswick * Nick Adams: Nick Grant * George De Vries: Duncan * Michael DeBeausset: Cliff Lawson * Heather Hewitt: Edith Blaiswick * Shirley Parker: Alice Grant  Reception  Science fiction scholar Gary Westfahl stated in his book The Spacesuit Film that Mission Mars \\"devolves into a conventional monster movie.\\"Westfahl, p. 214. Writing for The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Westfahl found the Martian plants to be strikingly bizarre and the low-budget film to be of about average quality for science fiction films of the era. Writer Thomas Kent Miller commented in Mars in the Movies: A History, \\"The last 50 minutes of this 90-minute movie about the first trip to Mars would have made a wonderful episode of the original 1960s Outer Limits ... But as a theatrical movie, it's beyond awful (as bad as the same director's Santa Claus Conquers the Martians).\\" Miller cited the special effects as interesting.Miller, pp. 97‚Äì98. TV Guide gave the movie one out of five stars. While it liked the ending, and the use of a non-humanoid alien, it found the movie overall to be plodding, dull and amateurish. Production The movie includes stock footage of Cape Kennedy. It was the first movie to be made at Miami's Studio City Complex. Also released in the UK as Murder in the Third Dimension.

The flight from Chicago was uneventful and at 10:50 local time the airliner departed Pittsburgh bound for Baltimore. At 11:25 while cruising at 11,000 feet Washington Air Traffic Control cleared Flight 300 to descend and maintain 7,000 feet. At 11:26 the Viscount crew reported descending through 10,000 feet over Martinsburg and radar contact was made by ATC. 48 seconds later flight 300 reported leaving 9,000 feet with clearance to 5,000 feet. This was the last radio transmission from the Viscount. The T-33 jet trainer launched from Martin State Airport at 11:07 for a VFR familiarization flight. The T-33's air speed was significantly higher as it approached the Viscount from the left and behind. The Viscounts indicated air speed was 235 knots while the T-33's was 290 knots with a closing rate of approximately 195 knots. While slowly climbing through 8,000 feet at 85 percent engine power the jet banked slightly to the right and impacted the left side of the airliner forward of the wing. The airliner pitched up, its air speed decreasing, then the nose dropped and the aircraft entered a steep spin to the right, slowing to a flat spin before it struck the ground. The T-33 pilot was thrown clear of the flaming jet and parachuted safely to the ground but was badly burned. The jet disintegrated after the collision and the passenger was fatally injured. Aircraft and crew= Vickers aircraft and crew = The four engine Viscount V.745 British medium- range turboprop airliner, serial number 108, first flew from Hampshire, England on 6 January, 1956. Powered by Rolls-Royce Dart RDa3 Mark 506 engines turning four blade square tipped constant-speed propellers, it was delivered to Capital Airlines on 15 January, 1956 as fleet number 329. The pilot in command of Flight 300 was Captain Kendall Brady, age 38. He had a valid airman certificate and was rated to fly single/multi-engine land aircraft as well as the Douglas DC-3, DC-4 and the Vickers Viscount. Brady's total flying hours were 12,719 with 1,432 of those in the Viscount. He was hired by Capital Airlines on 11 June, 1945. Paul Meyer, age 26, served as co-pilot and started flying for Capital Airlines on 25 May, 1956. He was certified to operate single/multi-engine land aircraft and had an instrument rating. Meyer's total flight hours were 2,467, of which 1,596 were in the Viscount. = T-33 aircraft and crew = The two-place Lockheed T-33A Shooting Star subsonic American jet trainer aircraft involved was manufacture serial number 580-9528 and registered 53-5966. It was maintained by the Maryland Air National Guard and equipped with an Allison J33-A-35 turbojet engine. The pilot and sole survivor of the accident was Captain Julius McCoy, age 34. He was rated as a military pilot August 4, 1944 and joined the Maryland Air National Guard in 1952. He had a total of 1,902 hours in single- and multi-engine and single- engine jet aircraft 210 were in the T-33. Investigation The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) investigated the accident and released a report on January 9, 1959. It determined that the collision happened during VFR conditions and that both aircraft would have been in clear cloud free air nine-tenths of the time. The report noted that it is the overtaking aircraft's responsibility to see and avoid a collision. A contributing factor in the accident was that the small size of the T-33 made it difficult to pick up on radar. The board attributed no blame to the Viscount crew and stated in conclusion that \\"The Board determines the probable cause of this accident was the failure of the T-33 pilot to exercise a proper and adequate vigilance to see and avoid other traffic.\\" See also *Eastern Air Lines Flight 45 *1958 in aviation *List of accidents and incidents on commercial aircraft *Mid-air collision - includes a list of other notable mid-air collisions.

By the turn of the twentieth century, two basic architectures for underwater breathing apparatus had been pioneered; open-circuit surface supplied equipment where the diver's exhaled gas is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit breathing apparatus where the diver's carbon dioxide is filtered from the exhaled breathing gas, which is then recirculated, and more gas added to replenish the oxygen content. Closed circuit equipment was more easily adapted to scuba in the absence of reliable, portable, and economical high pressure gas storage vessels. By the mid-twentieth century, high pressure cylinders were available and two systems for scuba had emerged: open-circuit scuba where the diver's exhaled breath is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit scuba where the carbon dioxide is removed from the diver's exhaled breath which has oxygen added and is recirculated. Oxygen rebreathers are severely depth limited due to oxygen toxicity risk, which increases with depth, and the available systems for mixed gas rebreathers were fairly bulky and designed for use with diving helmets. The first commercially practical scuba rebreather was designed and built by the diving engineer Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London. His self contained breathing apparatus consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with an estimated 50‚Äì60% oxygen supplied from a copper tank and carbon dioxide scrubbed by passing it through a bundle of rope yarn soaked in a solution of caustic potash. During the 1930s and all through World War II, the British, Italians and Germans developed and extensively used oxygen rebreathers to equip the first frogmen. In the U.S. Major Christian J. Lambertsen invented a free-swimming oxygen rebreather. In 1952 he patented a modification of his apparatus, this time named SCUBA, an acronym for \\"self- contained underwater breathing apparatus,\\" which became the generic English word for autonomous breathing equipment for diving, and later for the activity using the equipment. After World War II, military frogmen continued to use rebreathers since they do not make bubbles which would give away the presence of the divers. The high percentage of oxygen used by these early rebreather systems limited the depth at which they could be used due to the risk of convulsions caused by acute oxygen toxicity. Although a working demand regulator system had been invented in 1864 by Auguste Denayrouze and Beno√Æt Rouquayrol, the first open-circuit scuba system developed in 1925 by Yves Le Prieur in France was a manually adjusted free-flow system with a low endurance, which limited the practical usefulness of the system. In 1942, during the German occupation of France, Jacques-Yves Cousteau and √âmile Gagnan designed the first successful and safe open-circuit scuba, a twin hose system known as the Aqua-Lung. Their system combined an improved demand regulator with high-pressure air tanks. This was patented in 1945. To sell his regulator in English-speaking countries Cousteau registered the Aqua-Lung trademark, which was first licensed to the U.S. Divers company, and in 1948 to Siebe Gorman of England, Siebe Gorman was allowed to sell in Commonwealth countries, but had difficulty in meeting the demand and the U.S. patent prevented others from making the product. The patent was circumvented by Ted Eldred of Melbourne, Australia, who developed the single-hose open-circuit scuba system, which separates the first stage and demand valve of the pressure regulator by a low-pressure hose, puts the demand valve at the diver's mouth, and releases exhaled gas through the demand valve casing. Eldred sold the first Porpoise Model CA single hose scuba early in 1952. Early scuba sets were usually provided with a plain harness of shoulder straps and waist belt. Many harnesses did not have a backplate, and the cylinders rested directly against the diver's back. Early scuba divers dived without a buoyancy aid. In an emergency they had to jettison their weights. In the 1960s adjustable buoyancy life jackets (ABLJ) became available, which can be used to compensate for loss of buoyancy at depth due to compression of the neoprene wetsuit and as a lifejacket that will hold an unconscious diver face-upwards at the surface. The first versions were inflated from a small disposable carbon dioxide cylinder, later with a small direct coupled air cylinder. A low-pressure feed from the regulator first-stage to an inflation/deflation valve unit an oral inflation valve and a dump valve lets the volume of the ABLJ be controlled as a buoyancy aid. In 1971 the stabilizer jacket was introduced by ScubaPro. This class of buoyancy aid is known as a buoyancy control device or buoyancy compensator. A backplate and wing is an alternative configuration of scuba harness with a buoyancy compensation bladder known as a \\"wing\\" mounted behind the diver, sandwiched between the backplate and the cylinder or cylinders. This arrangement became popular with cave divers making long or deep dives, who needed to carry several extra cylinders, as it clears the front and sides of the diver for other equipment to be attached in the region where it is easily accessible. Sidemount is a scuba diving equipment configuration which has basic scuba sets, each comprising a single cylinder with a dedicated regulator and pressure gauge, mounted alongside the diver, clipped to the harness below the shoulders and along the hips, instead of on the back of the diver. It originated as a configuration for advanced cave diving, as it facilitates penetration of tight sections of cave, as sets can be easily removed and remounted when necessary. Sidemount diving has grown in popularity within the technical diving community for general decompression diving, and has become a popular specialty for recreational diving. In the 1950s the United States Navy (USN) documented procedures for military use of what is now called nitrox, and in 1970, Morgan Wells, of (NOAA) began instituting diving procedures for oxygen-enriched air. In 1979 NOAA published procedures for the scientific use of nitrox in the NOAA Diving Manual. In 1985 IAND (International Association of Nitrox Divers) began teaching nitrox use for recreational diving. After initial resistance by some agencies, the use of a single nitrox mixture has become part of recreational diving, and multiple gas mixtures are common in technical diving to reduce overall decompression time. Nitrogen narcosis limits the depth when breathing nitrox mixtures. In 1924 the US Navy started to investigate the possibility of using helium and after animal experiments, human subjects breathing heliox 20/80 (20% oxygen, 80% helium) were successfully decompressed from deep dives, Cave divers started using trimix to allow deeper dives and it was used extensively in the 1987 Wakulla Springs Project and spread to the north-east American wreck diving community. The challenges of deeper dives and longer penetrations and the large amounts of breathing gas necessary for these dive profiles and ready availability of oxygen sensing cells beginning in the late 1980s led to a resurgence of interest in rebreather diving. By accurately measuring the partial pressure of oxygen, it became possible to maintain and accurately monitor a breathable gas mixture in the loop at any depth. In the mid 1990s semi-closed circuit rebreathers became available for the recreational scuba market, followed by closed circuit rebreathers around the turn of the millennium. Rebreathers are currently (2018) manufactured for the military, technical and recreational scuba markets. Early history John Lethbridge's diving dress, the first enclosed diving suit, built in the 1710s. A scuba set is characterized by full independence from the surface during use, by providing breathing gas carried by the diver. Early attempts to reach this autonomy were made in the 18th century by the Englishman John Lethbridge, who invented and successfully built his own underwater diving machine in 1715, but though the air supply was carried in the diving apparatus, it relied on surface tenders to deploy and move around under the water, and was effectively an atmospheric pressure diving bell. An early diving dress using a compressed air reservoir was designed and built in 1771 by SieurOld French for \\"sir\\" or \\"Mister\\" Fr√©minet from Paris. He conceived an autonomous breathing machine equipped with a reservoir, dragged behind the diver or mounted on his back. Fr√©minet called his invention machine hydrostatergatique and used it successfully for more than ten years in the harbors of Le Havre and Brest, as stated in the explanatory text of a 1784 painting. thumbDiagram of the diving suit invented by Charles Condert of Brooklyn, N.Y. The Frenchman Paul Lemaire d'Augerville built and used autonomous diving equipment in 1824, as did the British William H. James in 1825. James' helmet was made of \\"thin copper or sole of leather\\" with a plate window, and the air was supplied from an iron reservoir. A similar system was used in 1831 by the American Charles Condert, who died in 1832 while testing his invention in the East River at only deep. The oldest known oxygen rebreather was patented on June 17, 1808 by Sieur Touboulic from Brest, mechanic in Napoleon's Imperial Navy, but there is no evidence of any prototype having been manufactured. This early rebreather design worked with an oxygen reservoir, the oxygen being delivered progressively by the diver himself and circulating in a closed circuit through a sponge soaked in limewater. After having travelled to England and discovered William James' invention, the French physician Manuel Th√©odore Guillaumet, from Argentan (Normandy), patented in 1838 the oldest known regulator mechanism. Guillaumet's invention was air-supplied from the surface and was never mass-produced due to problems with safety. The oldest practical rebreather relates to the 1849 patent from the Frenchman Pierre Aimable De Saint Simon Sicard. First successful scuba equipment None of those inventions solved the problem of high pressure when compressed air must be supplied to the diver (as in modern regulators); they were mostly based on a constant-flow supply of the air. The compression and storage technology was not advanced enough to allow compressed air to be stored in containers at sufficiently high pressures to allow useful dive times. By the turn of the twentieth century, two basic templates for a scuba had emerged; open-circuit scuba where the diver's exhaled gas is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit scuba where the diver's carbon dioxide is filtered from unused oxygen, which is then recirculated. =Open circuit= The Rouquayrol- Denayrouze apparatus was the first regulator to be mass-produced (from 1865 to 1965). In this picture the air reservoir presents its surface-supplied configuration. The first systems that became widely popular with recreational divers were open circuit demand scuba. They were safer than early rebreather systems, less expensive to operate, and allowed dives to greater depths. An important step for the development of open circuit scuba technology was the invention of the demand regulator, a mechanism that conserves breathing gas supply by providing flow only when the outlet pressure is reduced when the diver inhales. In 1864, the French engineers Auguste Denayrouze and Beno√Æt Rouquayrol designed and patented their \\"Rouquayrol-Denayrouze diving suit\\" after adapting a pressure regulator and developing it for underwater use. This would be the first diving suit that could automatically supply air to the diver on demand by adjusting the flow of air from the tank to meet the diver's breathing and pressure requirements. The system still had to use surface supply to provide useful endurance, as the pressure cylinder provided was only a low capacity accumulator. The first open-circuit scuba system was devised in 1925 by Yves Le Prieur in France. Inspired by the simple ambient pressure supply valve apparatus of Maurice Fernez and the freedom it allowed the diver, he made it independent of surface supply by using three litre Michelin cylinders containing air compressed to . The \\"Fernez-Le Prieur\\" diving apparatus was demonstrated at the swimming pool of Tourelles in Paris in 1926. The unit consisted of a cylinder of compressed air carried on the back of the diver, connected to a pressure regulator designed by Le Prieur which was adjusted manually by the diver, with two gauges, one for tank pressure and one for output (supply) pressure. Air was supplied continuously through the mouthpiece and exhausted through a short tube fitted with a non-return exhaust valve as in the Fernez design. The continuous flow of air and the consequent low endurance of the apparatus limited the practical use of LePrieur's device. Fernez had previously invented a noseclip, a mouthpiece fitted with a one-way valve for exhalation and diving goggles, and Le Prieur just added a manually- controlled regulator and a compressed air cylinder to those elements. Fernez's goggles did not cover the nose, which allows the diver to equalise the internal pressure by letting air flow into the goggles through the nose, so they did not allow a dive deeper than ten metres due to \\"mask squeeze\\". In 1933, Le Prieur replaced the goggles, noseclip and valve) by a full face mask, directly supplied with constant flow air from the cylinder. Le Prieur's design was the first autonomous breathing device used by the first scuba diving clubs in history ‚Äì Racleurs de fond founded by Glenn Orr in California in 1933, and Club des sous-l'eau founded by Le Prieur himself in Paris in 1935. In 1942, during the German occupation of France, Jacques-Yves Cousteau and √âmile Gagnan designed the first reliable and commercially successful open-circuit scuba, known as the Aqua-Lung. Their system combined an improved demand regulator with high-pressure air tanks. √âmile Gagnan, an engineer employed by the Air Liquide company, miniaturized and adapted the regulator manufactured for use with gas generators in response to the constant fuel shortage that was a consequence of German requisitioning. Gagnan's boss, Henri Melchior, knew that his son-in-law Jacques-Yves Cousteau was looking for an automatic demand regulator to increase the useful endurance of the underwater breathing apparatus invented by Le Prieur, so he introduced Cousteau to Gagnan in December 1942. On Cousteau's initiative, Gagnan's regulator was adapted to diving, and the new Cousteau-Gagnan patent was registered some weeks later in 1943. =Closed circuit= Henry Fleuss (1851‚Äì1932) improved the rebreather technology. The alternative concept, developed in roughly the same time frame was closed-circuit scuba. The body normally consumes and metabolises only a small fraction of inhaled oxygen ‚Äì the situation is even more wasteful of oxygen when the breathing gas is compressed as it is in ambient pressure breathing systems underwater. The rebreather recycles the exhaled breathing gas, while constantly replenishing it from an oxygen-rich supply so that the oxygen level is not depleted. The apparatus also has to remove the exhaled carbon dioxide, as a buildup of CO2 levels would result in respiratory distress and hypercapnia. The first commercially practical scuba rebreather was designed and built by the diving engineer Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London. His self contained breathing apparatus consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with an estimated 50‚Äì60% oxygen supplied from a copper tank and carbon dioxide scrubbed by passing it through a bundle of rope yarn soaked in a solution of caustic potash, the system giving a dive duration of up to about three hours. Fleuss tested his device in 1879 by spending an hour submerged in a water tank, then one week later by diving to a depth of in open water, on which occasion he was slightly injured when his assistants abruptly pulled him to the surface. This apparatus was first used under operational conditions in 1880 by Alexander Lambert, the lead diver on the Severn Tunnel construction project, who was able to travel in the darkness to close several submerged sluice doors in the tunnel; this had defeated the best efforts of standard divers due to extremely long distance, along which their air supply hoses became fouled on submerged debris, and the strong water currents in the workings. Fleuss continually improved his apparatus, adding a demand regulator and tanks capable of holding greater amounts of oxygen at higher pressure. Sir Robert Davis, head of Siebe Gorman, improved the oxygen rebreather in 1910 with his invention of the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus, the first rebreather to be made in quantity. While intended primarily as an emergency escape apparatus for submarine crews, it was soon also used for diving, being a handy shallow water diving apparatus with a thirty-minute endurance, and as an industrial breathing set. Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus being tested at the submarine escape test tank at HMS Dolphin, Gosport, 14 December 1942. The rig comprised a rubber breathing/buoyancy bag containing a canister of barium hydroxide to absorb exhaled carbon dioxide and, in a pocket at the lower end of the bag, a steel pressure cylinder holding approximately of oxygen at a pressure of which was equipped with a control valve and connected to the breathing bag. Opening the cylinder's valve admitted oxygen to the bag at ambient pressure. The rig also included an emergency buoyancy bag on its front to help keep the wearer afloat. After further development by Davis in 1927 the DSEA was adopted by the Royal Navy. In 1911 Dr√§ger of Lubeck tested a self-contained rebreather system for standard diving equipment, which used an injector system to circulate the breathing gas through the breathing loop and scrubber. This was put into service soon thereafter and was available in two versions, an oxygen rebreather DM20 for depths shallower than 20 m, and a nitrox rebreather DM40 for depths up to 40 m. During the 1930s and all through World War II, the British, Italians and Germans developed and extensively used oxygen rebreathers to equip the first frogmen. The British adapted the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus and the Germans adapted the Dr√§ger submarine escape rebreathers, for their frogmen during the war. The Italians developed similar rebreathers for the combat swimmers of the Decima Flottiglia MAS, especially the Pirelli ARO. In the U.S. Major Christian J. Lambertsen invented an underwater free-swimming oxygen rebreather in 1939, which was accepted by the Office of Strategic Services. In 1952 he patented a modification of his apparatus, this time named SCUBA,(an acronym for \\"self-contained underwater breathing apparatus\\"), which later became the generic English word for autonomous breathing equipment for diving, and later for the activity using the equipment. After World War II, military frogmen continued to use rebreathers since they do not make bubbles which would give away the presence of the divers. The high percentage of oxygen used by these early rebreather systems limited the depth at which they could be used due to the risk of convulsions caused by acute oxygen toxicity. Post WWII Mistral twin-hose regulator mounted on a diving cylinder. The regulator comprises the mouthpiece and the regulator body, connected by the supply and exhaust hoses. The regulator is connected to the outlet valve of the high-pressure cylinder. Air Liquide started selling the Cousteau-Gagnan regulator commercially in 1946 under the name of scaphandre Cousteau-Gagnan or CG45 (\\"C\\" for Cousteau, \\"G\\" for Gagnan and 45 for the 1945 patent). The same year Air Liquide created a division called La Spirotechnique, to develop and sell regulators and other diving equipment. To sell his regulator in English-speaking countries Cousteau registered the Aqua-Lung trademark, which was first licensed to the U.S. Divers company.(the American division of Air Liquide) and later sold with La Spirotechnique and U.S. Divers to finally become the name of the company, Aqua-Lung/La Spirotechnique, currently located in Carros, near Nice. In 1948 the Cousteau-Gagnan patent was also licensed to Siebe Gorman of England, Siebe Gorman was allowed to sell in Commonwealth countries, but had difficulty in meeting the demand and the U.S. patent prevented others from making the product. This patent was circumvented by Ted Eldred of Melbourne, Australia, who had been developing a rebreather called the Porpoise. When a demonstration of this rebreather resulted in a diver passing out, he developed the single- hose open-circuit scuba system, which separates the first stage and demand valve of the pressure regulator by a low-pressure hose, puts the demand valve at the diver's mouth, and releases exhaled gas through the demand valve casing. Eldred sold the first Porpoise Model CA single hose scuba early in 1952. Early scuba sets were usually provided with a plain harness of shoulder straps and waist belt. The waist belt buckles were usually quick-release, and shoulder straps sometimes had adjustable or quick release buckles. Many harnesses did not have a backplate, and the cylinders rested directly against the diver's back. Early scuba divers dived without a buoyancy aid. In an emergency they had to jettison their weights. In the 1960s adjustable buoyancy life jackets (ABLJ) became available, which can be used to compensate for loss of buoyancy at depth due to compression of the neoprene wetsuit and as a lifejacket that will hold an unconscious diver face-upwards at the surface, and that can be quickly inflated. The first versions were inflated from a small disposable carbon dioxide cylinder, later with a small direct coupled air cylinder. A low-pressure feed from the regulator first-stage to an inflation/deflation valve unit lets the volume of the ABLJ be controlled as a buoyancy aid. In 1971 the stabilizer jacket was introduced by ScubaPro. This class of buoyancy aid is known as a buoyancy control device or buoyancy compensator. A backplate and wing is an alternative configuration of scuba harness with a buoyancy compensation bladder known as a \\"wing\\" mounted behind the diver, sandwiched between the backplate and the cylinder or cylinders. Unlike stabilizer jackets, the backplate and wing is a modular system, in that it consists of separable components. This arrangement became popular with cave divers making long or deep dives, who needed to carry several extra cylinders, as it clears the front and sides of the diver for other equipment to be attached in the region where it is easily accessible. This additional equipment is usually suspended from the harness or carried in pockets on the exposure suit. In 1911 Draeger of Germany tested an injector operated rebreather backpack for a standard diving suit. This concept was produced and marketed as the DM20 oxygen rebreather system and the DM40 nitrox rebreather system, in which air from one cylinder and oxygen from a second cylinder were mixed during injection through a nozzle which circulated the breathing gas through the scrubber and the rest of the loop. The DM40 was rated for depths up to 40m. In the 1950s the United States Navy (USN) documented enriched oxygen gas procedures for military use of what we today call nitrox, in the USN Diving Manual, and in 1970, Morgan Wells, who was the first director of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Diving Center, began instituting diving procedures for oxygen-enriched air. In 1979 NOAA published Wells' procedures for the scientific use of nitrox in the NOAA Diving Manual. In 1985 Dick Rutkowski, a former NOAA diving safety officer, formed IAND (International Association of Nitrox Divers) and began teaching nitrox use for recreational diving. This was considered dangerous by some, and met with heavy skepticism by the diving community. Nevertheless, in 1992 NAUI became the first existing major recreational diver training agency to sanction nitrox, and eventually, in 1996, the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) announced full educational support for nitrox. The use of a single nitrox mixture has become part of recreational diving, and multiple gas mixtures are common in technical diving to reduce overall decompression time. Technical diver during a decompression stop Technical diving is recreational scuba diving that exceeds the generally accepted recreational limits, and may expose the diver to hazards beyond those normally associated with recreational diving, and to greater risks of serious injury or death. These risks may be reduced by appropriate skills, knowledge and experience, and by using suitable equipment and procedures. The term technical diving has been credited to Michael Menduno, who was editor of the (now defunct) diving magazine aquaCorps Journal. The concept and term are both relatively recent advents, although divers had already been engaging in what is now commonly referred to as technical diving for decades. In his 1989 book, Advanced Wreck Diving, author and leading technical diver, Gary Gentile, commented that there was no accepted term for divers who dived beyond agency-specified recreational limits for non-professional purposes. Revised editions use the term technical diving, and Gentile published a further book in 1999 entitled The Technical Diving Handbook. There is some professional disagreement as to what exactly technical diving encompasses. Nitrox diving and rebreather diving were originally considered technical, but this is no longer universally the case as several certification agencies now offer recreational nitrox and recreational rebreather training and certification. Even those who agree on the broad definitions of technical diving may disagree on the precise boundaries between technical and recreational diving. One reasonably widely held definition is that any dive in which at some point of the planned profile it is not physically possible or physiologically acceptable to make a direct and uninterrupted vertical ascent to surface air is a technical dive. The equipment often involves breathing gases other than air or standard nitrox mixtures, multiple gas sources, and different equipment configurations. Over time, some equipment and techniques developed for technical diving have become more widely accepted for recreational diving. Nitrogen narcosis limits the depth reachable by underwater divers when breathing nitrox mixtures. In 1924 the US Navy started to investigate the possibility of using helium and after animal experiments, human subjects breathing heliox 20/80 (20% oxygen, 80% helium) were successfully decompressed from deep dives, followed by salvage diver Max Nohl's dive to 127 meters in 1937. and the 1939 US Navy salvage of USS Squalus. In 1963 saturation dives using trimix were made during Project Genesis, and in 1979 a research team at the Duke University Medical Center Hyperbaric Laboratory started work which identified the use of trimix to prevent High Pressure Nervous Syndrome symptoms. Cave divers started using trimix to allow deeper dives and it was used extensively in the 1987 Wakulla Springs Project and spread to the north-east American wreck diving community, and by 1994 John Chatterton and Gary Gentile, dived on the RMS Lusitania expedition to a depth of 100 meters using trimix. Rebreather diver returning from a dive The challenges of deeper dives and longer penetrations and the large amounts of breathing gas necessary for these dive profiles reawakened interest in rebreathers. The ready availability of oxygen sensing cells beginning in the late 1980s led to a resurgence of interest in rebreather diving. By accurately measuring the partial pressure of oxygen, it became possible to maintain and accurately monitor a breathable gas mixture in the loop at any depth. In the mid 1990s semi-closed circuit rebreathers became available for the recreational scuba market, followed by closed circuit rebreathers around the turn of the millennium. Rebreathers are currently (2018) manufactured for the military, technical and recreational scuba markets. Sidemount diver pushing a cylinder in front Sidemount is a scuba diving equipment configuration which has basic scuba sets, each comprising a single cylinder with a dedicated regulator and pressure gauge, mounted alongside the diver, clipped to the harness below the shoulders and along the hips, instead of on the back of the diver. It originated as a configuration for advanced cave diving, as it facilitates penetration of tight sections of cave, as sets can be easily removed and remounted when necessary. The configuration allows easy access to cylinder valves, and provides easy and reliable gas redundancy. These benefits for operating in confined spaces were also recognized by divers who made wreck diving penetrations. Sidemount diving is now growing in popularity within the technical diving community for general decompression diving, and has become a popular specialty for recreational diving, with several diver certification agencies offering recreational and technical level sidemount training programs. =Dive computers= Uwatec Aladin Pro dive computer showing the log of a previous dive Shearwater Perdix and Ratio iX3M GPS dive computers in compass mode Submersible wireless pressure transducer for remote dive computer display Scuba decompression planning originally based on printed decompression tables developed for surface supplied air diving. This was inefficient for multi-level dives, and the custom of multilevel diving using tables was not supported by formal experimental testing, but seemed to work reasonably well in practice in accordance with the theoretical models. The Office of Naval Research funded a project with the Scripps Institute of Oceanography for the theoretical design of a prototype decompression analog computer. The Foxboro Decomputer, Mark I was manufactured by the Foxboro Company and evaluated by the US Navy Experimental Diving Unit in 1957. It was not successful. The first recreational mechanical analogue dive computer, the \\"decompression meter\\" was designed by the Italians De Sanctis & Alinari in 1959 and built in their factory named SOS, which also made depth gauges. The device functioned so poorly that it was eventually nicknamed \\"bendomatic\\". In 1965, Stubbs and Kidd applied their decompression model to a pneumatic analogue decompression computer. Several analogue decompression meters were subsequently made, some with several bladders for illustrating the effect on various body tissues, but they were sidelined with the arrival on the scene of electronic computers. In 1983, the Hans Hass-DecoBrain, designed by Divetronic AG a Swiss start-up, became the first digital electronic diving computer, capable of displaying the information that became the industry basic standard. The DecoBrain was based on A. B√ºhlmann's 16 compartment (ZHL-12) tissue model In 1984 development of the US Navy diving computer which was based on a 9 tissue mixed gas model used for the US Navy tables for the MK-15 rebreather was completed by Divetronic AG by adapting the Deco Brain under an R&D; contract. The 1984 Orca EDGE was produced. The EDGE displayed the ceiling or the so-called \\"safe-ascent-depth\\". A drawback was that divers faced by a ceiling did not know how long they would have to decompress, but the display featuring the saturation level of 12 tissue bars permitted experienced users to make a reasonable estimate of their decompression obligation. Orca Industries continued to refine their technology with the release of the Skinny-dipper in 1987 to do calculations for repetitive diving. They later released the Delphi computer in 1989 that included calculations for diving at altitude as well as profile recording. Even by the late 1980s, dive computers were not widely accepted. There was a general mistrust of relying on electronics that your life might depend upon underwater, and objections ranging from dive resorts felt that the increased bottom time would upset their schedules, to that some divers felt that the increased bottom time would esult in many more cases of decompression sickness. A workshop held under the auspices of the American Academy of Underwater Sciences brought together a diverse group that included most of the dive computer designers and manufacturers, some of the best known hyperbaric medicine theorists and practitioners, representatives from the recreational diving agencies, the cave diving community and the scientific diving community.\\" This workshop produced a set of consensus recommendations for the design and safe use of dive computers that was generally accepted by the scuba diving community, and consequently the opposition to dive computers dissipated, numerous new models were introduced, the technology dramatically improved and dive computers became the standard scuba diving decompression monitoring equipment. In 2001, the US Navy approved the use of Cochran NAVY decompression computer with the VVAL 18 Thalmann algorithm for Special Warfare operations. In 2008, the Underwater Digital Interface (UDI) was released to the market. This dive computer, based on the RGBM model, includes an underwater communication system that enables divers to transmit text messages, also featuring SOS and homing capabilities, and digital 3D compass. Training agencies have introduced the use of dive computers as part of standard training Wireless gas pressure displays and consumption rate calculations have been incorporated into some dive computers, which can estimate the remaining bottom time to provide easier gas management. This reduces the risk of out of gas emergencies for single mix no-stop dives. Later developments include multiple wireless transducers which can be set to the specific gas mixture in the associated cylinder, and adjust the decompression algorithm accordingly. Various other software and hardware features may be available depending on the model. =Industry growth= The recreational scuba diving industry diving experienced major growth at the end of the 20th century. The number of new divers per year has stabilised since then. Estimated 1 million new divers were certified in 2012. Scuba diving remains a dynamic recreation ‚Äì there is continuous development of equipment and practices. Many recreational divers trained every year, but most do not appear to dive very often. Large dropout rate after initial and advanced training. Industry sectors: *Diver training ‚Äì commercialisation of training, breaking training down into smaller components for diver convenience and industry profit *Equipment sales ‚Äì wide range of equipment, catering for fashion and personal preferences as well as technical necessity, safety and effectiveness *Consumables sales and equipment maintenance ‚Äì supporting the established diver as well as the novice and occasional diver. *Dive charters, guided dives ‚Äì targeting vacationers and travellers to exotic destinations. Professional scuba industry much lower numbers, but higher levels of training, and lower dropout rate. Greater motivation as it is part of the job. Probably insignificant to the industry as a whole. Slightly different equipment use. Military scuba supports some manufacturers of specialised equipment  Scuba training  Scuba training of professional and recreational divers has been separate from the earliest days, but has developed in parallel as the equipment and many of the procedures are common regardless of application. The main factor separating the two applications is occupational health and safety, which applies to professional diving, but generally not to recreational diving. = Professional scuba training and certification = Professional diving is done as a part of the work the diver is employed to do, and as such is generally subject to occupational health and safety regulation. This extends to training, certification and the associated training standards. Commercial diver training is often regulated by national or state government, so details and standards tend to vary internationally, but there are systems in place for recognition of minimum standards between jurisdictions, allowing some international portability of commercial diver certification. In some jurisdictions a distinction is made between industrial commercial diving and professional diving as part of scientific or public safety occupations, where a variety of regulatory exemptions may apply. In situations where exemptions apply, the training and certification through recreational agencies may be recognised for professional diving activities where this is not permitted for industrial commercial diving. Military diving is frequently independent of commercial diving regulation, and military diver training is usually controlled by the armed forces which employ the divers. In some cases there is recognition of military diver qualifications for work in the civilian industry, in other cases not. The American Academy of Underwater Sciences (AAUS) is a group of scientific organizations and individual members who conduct scientific and educational activities underwater. It was organized in 1977 and incorporated in the State of California in 1983. The purpose of the AAUS is to facilitate the development of safe and productive scientific divers and scientific diving procedures through education, research, advocacy, and the advancement of the AAUS Standards for Scientific Diving Certification and Operation of Scientific Diving Programs. These are the consensual guidelines for scientific diving programs in the US, and are recognized by Occupational Safety and Health Administration as the \\"Standard\\" for scientific diving. These standards are followed by all AAUS Organizational Members allowing for reciprocity between institutions. Each institution is responsible for upholding the standards within its program and among its divers. The AAUS peer reviews the standards on a regular basis, so they represent the consensus of the scientific diving community and state-of-the-art technologies. The CMAS Scientific committee compiled and edited the UNESCO Code of Practice for Scientific diving between 1977 and the publication of the document as Unesco technical papers in marine science 53 in 1988. The International Diving Schools Association (IDSA) was formed in 1982 with the primary purpose of developing common international standards for commercial diver training. The Association has published basic tables for international comparison of training standards for commercial divers and some specialist non-diving qualifications such as diving supervisors, diving medical technicians and life support technicians based on consensus of members. The International Diving Regulators Forum (IDRF) confirmed its principals and purpose at their meeting in London in September 2009. The statement of principals and purpose states \\"The forum has agreed to work together towards mutual recognition to identify and implement best practice in diver training and assessment with the objective of harmonising cross-border diver training outside Europe.\\" The organisation has since changed its name to International Diving Regulators and Certifiers Forum (IDRCF) Members of the IDRF include ADAS (Australia), DCBC (Canada), HSE (UK), PSA (Norway), and the Secretariat General to the Sea Progress Committee (France). *UK HSE Diving at work regulations *Australian Diver Accreditation Scheme (ADAS) and Australian scientific diving CoP *South African Diving Regulations ‚Äì 2001, 2009, previous to 2001, 2018, CoP for commercial diver training *Various Canadian standards and regulations = Recreational scuba training and certification = The need for formalised training was recognised due to the high number of recreational scuba accidents. This started with informal training and led to the creation of training and certification agencies. BS-AC was formed in 1953, CMAS in 1959, NAUI in 1960 and PADI in 1966. The sport of scuba diving had its roots among the multitude of small enthusiastic snorkelling and spearfishing clubs in the decades just before and after the Second World War. After the invention of the \\"aqualung\\" by Cousteau and Gagnan, the first commercially marketed underwater breathing apparatus became available for sale for sporting purposes in the late 1940s. In 1951, Jim Auxie Jr and Chuck Blakeslee started a magazine called The Skin Diver (later renamed Skin Diver Magazine). Neal Earl Hess, who had been teaching divers for two years, contributed to its column \\"The Instructors Corner\\", to inform readers about scuba. He soon established a column called \\"The National Diving Patrol\\" as a section to name new skin and scuba diving \\"instructors\\". Still, no official training and certifying agency existed, except for the training and resources provided by the military (Underwater Demolition Teams) and dive clubs. Graduate students Conrad Limbaugh and Andy Rechnitzer used two of the first aqualungs brought to the US in 1948 on the California coast and enrolled at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1950, where they informally tutored some of their colleagues. After a student diver at another university died in a scuba accident in 1952, Scripps administration got Limbaugh to produce the first formal scuba training manual and course in the US. Training and emergency procedures such as the buddy system, buddy breathing, and scuba ditch and recovery were introduced and developed by Limbaugh and Rechnitzer. They workshopped possible emergencies and developed workable responses, which became standard practice for professional and recreational scuba diving. Ditching scuba equipment and recovering it from the bottom were done as psychological preparation for emergencies. Stress training by subjecting the trainee to emergencies by knocking off masks and mouthpieces underwater and closing off air supplies were used as a way to assess reaction to stress and accustom the diver to responding promptly and usefully to an emergency. The buddy system was established as a useful way to help manage an emergency by having a competent person to assist. Rechnitzer claims to have suggested the buddy system to Hanauer, and they followed up by developing a workable buddy breathing system for the twin-hose regulator. Some of these practices were later modified or dropped from training when equipment changed, or they were seen as obstacles to expanding the recreational diving industry. Others remained, or were retained by some training organisations as they were considered to produce a more resilient diver. In 1952, Al Tillman, the director of sports for the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation, wrote a letter to Parks and Recreation director Paul Gruendyke stating that: ‚ÄúA new sport‚Äîskin diving‚Äîis becoming popular in the area. Recently while diving in Palos Verdes, I ran into several divers in the water with me who didn‚Äôt know what they were doing. One had one of the new underwater breathing units that allows divers to stay under for long periods of time... I propose that my department get involved in this sport and provide training classes. I believe that diving will grow in the future and we have an obligation to make the sport as safe as possible.\\" On 15 October 1953, the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) was founded by Oscar Gugen, Peter Small, Mary Small, and Trevor Hampton. The Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation sent three representatives‚ÄîAl Tillman, Bev Morgan and Ramsey Parks‚Äîto take Limbaugh's course in 1954. They subsequently started training recreational scuba divers, making this the first scuba instructor training in America. In 1955, Tillman and L.A. County lifeguard Bev Morgan created the L.A. County Parks and Recreational Underwater Instructor Certification Course (1UICC) in an effort to respond to the growing number of diver requests. It was the world's first civilian training program to certify recreational divers, and soon began granting Provisional Certification to instructors across the country. As the new sport of scuba diving rapidly expanded through the 1950s, several sporting organisations ‚Äì notably the YMCA ‚Äì began programmes to train swimming enthusiasts in this new aquatic pastime and began to codify what were believed to be the proper practices needed for this expanding amateur sport. The YMCA formed a committee to produce a training manual‚Äî\\"The New Science of Skin and Scuba Diving\\", which was first published in 1957, and in 1959 conducted the first national instructor training program. In the 1960 May issue of Skin Diver Magazine, The National Diving Patrol was announced as an official, national organization. Its purpose and function was \\"to insure competent underwater instruction and to reduce diving accidents through education.\\" In 1959, its name changed to the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI). In October 1961, NAUI was incorporated in the State of California as a non-profit educational organization, with Al Tillman as the President and Neal Hess as the Executive Secretary. In 1966 Ralph Ericson and John Cronin formed the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) in response to a perception that the existing system was not sufficiently responsive to the needs of inland diving instructors. A further split occurred in 1967 with the creation of the National Association of Scuba Diving Schools (NASDS) by John Gaffney and a group of diving equipment retailers, followed by a split from NASDS led by Bob Clark to form Scuba Schools International (SSI) in 1970. The Florida Skin Divers Association was formed from a group of local scuba diving clubs in 1952. In 1976 their scuba training committee split from FSDA to form the International Diving Educators Association (IDEA). Early scuba training included a large component of theory provided by classroom instruction, which could include more than 30 hours of physics, equipment mechanics and other theoretical aspects of diving knowledge. The skills training included fitness, watermanship skills and stress-management training, where staff would put the trainee through in-water situations simulating the most likely emergency situations, so that the divers would be more likely to manage real-life emergencies with composure. Much of this training was, and still is, part of commercial and military diver training. This training required the diver to show competence at both routine procedures and managing reasonably foreseeable emergencies‚Äîmuch the same requirement that persists for certification of professional divers. This approach could be justified by the unsophisticated equipment in use, which could be, and often was, serviced by the diver, and was more prone to malfunctions than later generation equipment. Current standard equipment such as submersible pressure gauges, buoyancy compensators and decompression computers were not available, and the recreational diver was obliged to avoid decompression illness by planning the dive and monitoring the planned dive using a diving watch, simple depth gauge, and decompression tables, sometimes shared with a companion. In the event of an equipment malfunction, the diver was unsupported except by a diving companion. This required a level of competence and discipline that is no longer considered essential for recreational diving by most certification agencies. By the late 1960s equipment was becoming more reliable, and the recreational diver was less likely to experience malfunctions, but the training remained much the same. An increased interest in diving among the general public, and the commercial drive to sell more equipment and training began to change the content and methods of training to a more widely marketable model in the mid 1970s. This included expanding the training to include open-water experience, which was previously not a universal requirement. By the 1970s a second open-water checkout was standard, and more were subsequently added in recognition that training in the actual environment where the skills will be used is important to develop competence. By the 1980s the current minimum requirement for open water diving of four training dives was well established. At the same time, classroom and confined water instruction changed to adapt to the changes on equipment, and to de-emphasise fundamental theory in favour of practical applications more likely to be useful in the expected range of experience for a recreational diver. The general acceptance of the buoyancy compensator, submersible pressure gauge, and alternate air supply in the form of a secondary demand valve as standard equipment changed the preferred emergency procedures for handling out-of-air emergencies, which were simpler to learn as well as reducing the risk. The buoyancy compensator also allowed training to focus on better buoyancy control and alternative methods of establishing appropriate buoyancy. Stress management was de-emphasised, and skills training concentrated on learning the standardised skill set known to be effective most of the time. These changes helped to allow a wider range of potential divers to enter the market. The buddy system had been thought to be a useful corollary to the \\"never swim alone\\" edicts of the YMCA swimming and lifesaving programmes. Cousteau himself independently implemented a buddy system from the earliest days of exploratory diving after a number of diving incidents. The buddy system did indeed have some very useful aspects: the cross checking of equipment before dives, the facilitating of assistance for possible entanglement problems or equipment failures, and the enhancement of the social nature of diving. The YMCA continued as a major force in the development of diver certification during the first 50 years of this new sport. When these programmes were adopted by the emerging scuba certification agencies such as BS-AC, NAUI and PADI, the practice of buddy diving led to one of the two main mantras of recreational scuba: \\"never hold your breath\\" and \\"never dive alone\\". An international congress of fifteen diving federations representing all underwater disciplines met in Brussels on 28 September 1958. National delegates attended from Belgium, Brazil, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Italy, Monaco, Portugal, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the former Yugoslavia. Following a decision at that congress, a meeting was held in Monaco on 9‚Äì11 January 1959, which officially established the World Underwater Federation, with an acronym CMAS based on its French title Conf√©d√©ration Mondiale des Activit√©s Subaquatiques. The Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) is a recreational diving membership and diver training organization founded in 1966 by John Cronin and Ralph Erickson. Cronin was originally a NAUI instructor who decided to form his own organization with Erickson, and to break diver training down into several modular courses instead of the single universal course then prevalent. Diving Science and Technology Corporation (DSAT), the development arm for the Recreational Dive Planner and PADI's Tec-Rec program, was founded in November 1986. Dick Rutkowski, previously a dive supervisor for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), formed the International Association of Nitrox Divers (IAND) in 1985 to teach the use of nitrox, which had been pioneered by NOAA, to recreational divers. In 1992 the name was changed to the International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers (IANTD). Technical Diving International (TDI) was founded in 1994 by Bret Gilliam, and others after a split from IANTD in 1993 to provide training for specialized diving situations. TDI courses include open circuit Nitrox, Trimix and Rebreather courses, and training for overhead environments like caves and wrecks. In 1998, International Training started a sister organization to TDI known as Scuba Diving International (SDI) focusing on recreational scuba and in 2000, Emergency Response Diving International (ERDI) to teach public safety diving. Following the recognition that solo diving does occur, is acceptably safe to many divers, and is a relatively common practice, Scuba Diving International (SDI) started Solo diving training and certification in 1999. In 2006 BSAC was the first recreational diving agency to introduce Nitrox diving as part of core training. Internationally recognised minimum training standards for recreational divers have been published by: RSTC, WRSTC, CMAS, ISO etc.( Rebreather training council?) The US Recreational Scuba Training Council (RSTC) was created in 1986 as a permanent body to sustain a relationship between various recreational diving training organisations. In 1991, it replaced the Diving Equipment Manufacturers Association (DEMA) (renamed as the Diving Equipment and Marketing Association in 1998) as the secretariat for the then American National Standards Institute (ANSI) committee for underwater safety (also known as the Z86 Committee). The Z86 committee was subsequently replaced by the committee for Diving Instructional Standards and Safety (also known as the Z375 committee). In 2007 it retained its appointment as the ANSI Accredited Standards Developer (ASD) for the Z375 committee. The US RSTC has been responsible for the development of a standard medical statement (in conjunction with the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society) and minimum training standards for diving hand signals and the following recreational diver grades‚ÄîIntroductory Scuba Experience, Supervised Diver, Open Water Diver, Enriched Air Nitrox Certification, Entry level Rescue Diver, Dive Supervisor, Assistant Instructor, Scuba Instructor and Scuba Instructor Trainer for member agencies. The World Recreational Scuba Training Council (WRSTC) was founded in 1999 to create minimum recreational diving training standards for the various scuba diving certification agencies across the world which are members. The WRSTC restricts its membership to national or regional councils. These councils consist of individual training organizations who collectively represent at least 50% of the annual diver certifications in the member council's country or region. A national council is referred to as a RSTC (Recreational Scuba Training Council). The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published minimum standards in 2007 (superseded by 2014 revisions) for: * ISO 24801-1:2014 Recreational diving services ‚Äì Requirements for the training of recreational scuba divers ‚Äì Part 1: Level 1 ‚Äì Supervised diver, * ISO 24801-2:2014 Recreational diving services ‚Äì Requirements for the training of recreational scuba divers ‚Äì Part 2: Level 2 ‚Äì Autonomous diver, * ISO 11107 ‚Äì 'Nitrox diving' * ISO 24801-3:2014 Recreational diving services ‚Äì Requirements for the training of recreational scuba divers ‚Äì Part 3: Level 3 ‚Äì Dive leader, * ISO 24802-1:2014 Recreational diving services ‚Äì Requirements for the training of scuba instructors ‚Äì Part 1: Level 1, and ISO 24802-2:2014 Recreational diving services ‚Äì Requirements for the training of scuba instructors ‚Äì Part 2: Level 2  Research into scuba diver safety  The non- profit Divers Alert Network (DAN) was founded at Duke University in 1980 to promote safe diving. and has expanded into a global group of not-for-profit organisations providing safety and insurance services to members and maintaining databases on diving accidents. They publish research results and collaborate with other organizations on projects of common interest, mostly regarding scuba diving safety. Project Stickybeak was a privately run collation of data on diving fatalities in the Asia Pacific region run by Douglas Walker for several years, with annual reports on fatality statistics. In 2007 Project Stickybeak was incorporated into the DAN Asia-Pacific data collection and dive accident reporting project. The British Sub-Aqua Club publishes an annual report of diving incidents.  History of specific fields of application for scuba diving = Military diving = Italian World War II frogman of \\"Gruppo Gamma\\" Davis apparatus, a rebreather originally conceived in 1910 by Robert Davis as an emergency submarine escape set. A SEAL Delivery Team member climbs aboard a delivery vehicle before launching from the back of the submarine . The first modern military scuba divers were the World War II Italian commando frogmen, of Decima Flottiglia MAS (now \\"ComSubIn\\": Comando Raggruppamento Subacquei e Incursori Teseo Tesei) which formed in 1938 and was first in action in 1940. Originally these divers were called \\"Uomini Gamma\\" because they were members of the top secret special unit called \\"Gruppo Gamma\\", which originated from the kind of Pirelli rubber skin- suit nicknamed muta gamma used by these divers. Later they were nicknamed \\"Uomini Rana\\", Italian for \\"frog men\\" This special corps used an early oxygen rebreather scuba set, the Auto Respiratore ad Ossigeno (A.R.O), a development of the Dr√§ger oxygen self-contained breathing apparatus designed for the mining industry and of the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus made by Siebe, Gorman & Co and by Bergomi, designed for escaping from sunken submarines. The Italian frogmen trained in La Spezia, Liguria, using swimfins, rubber dry suit, and the new A.R.O. scuba unit. After Italy declared war, the Decima Flottiglia MAS (X¬™ MAS) attempted several attacks on British naval bases in the Mediterranean between June 1940 and July 1941, but none was successful, because of equipment failure or early detection by British forces. On September 10, 1941, eight X¬™ MAS frogmen were inserted by submarine close to the British harbour at Gibraltar, where using human torpedoes to penetrate the defences, sank three merchant ships with limpet mines before escaping through neutral Spain. An even more successful attack, the Raid on Alexandria, was mounted on 19 December on the harbour at Alexandria, again using human torpedoes. The raid resulted in disabling the battleships and together with a destroyer and an oil tanker, but all six frogmen were captured. The British Royal Navy had captured an Italian human torpedo during a failed attack on Malta; they developed a copy called the Chariot and formed a unit called the Experimental Submarine Flotilla, which later merged with the Special Boat Service. A number of Chariot operations were attempted, most notably Operation Title in October 1942, an attack on the German battleship Tirpitz, which had to be abandoned when a storm hit the fishing boat which was towing the Chariots into position. The last and most successful British operation resulted in sinking two liners in Phuket harbour in Thailand in October 1944. An oxygen rebreather set called the Lambertsen Amphibious Respirator Unit (LARU) was invented in the United States 1939 by Christian Lambertsen, and was patented in 1940. Lambertsen later renamed it the Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus, which, contracted to SCUBA, eventually became the generic term for both open circuit and rebreather autonomous underwater breathing equipment. Lambertson demonstrated it to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) after being rejected by the U.S. Navy OSS not only bought into the concept, they hired Dr. Lambertsen to lead the program and build-up the dive element of their maritime unit. The OSS was the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency and the maritime element still exists inside their Special Activities Division. The Shayetet 13 commandos of the Israeli Navy have carried out a number of underwater raids on harbors. They were initially trained by veterans of X¬™ MAS and used Italian equipment. As part of Operation Raviv in 1969, eight frogmen used two human torpedoes to enter Ras Sadat naval base near Suez, where they destroyed two motor torpedo boats with mines. During the 1982 Falklands War, the Argentinian Naval Intelligence Service planned an attack on British warships at Gibraltar. Code named Operation Algeciras, three frogmen, recruited from a former anti-government insurgent group, were to plant mines on the ships' hulls. The operation was abandoned when the divers were arrested by Spanish police and deported. In 1985, the French nuclear weapons tests at Moruroa in the Pacific Ocean was being contested by environmental protesters led by the Greenpeace campaign ship, Rainbow Warrior. The Action Division of the French Directorate-General for External Security devised a plan to sink the Rainbow Warrior while it was berthed in harbor at Auckland in New Zealand. Two divers from the Division posed as tourists and attached two limpet mines to the ship's hull; the resulting explosion sank the ship and killed a Netherlands citizen on board. Two agents from the team, but not the divers, were arrested by the New Zealand Police and later convicted of manslaughter. The French government finally admitted responsibility two months later. In 1989, during the U.S. invasion of Panama, a team of four U.S. Navy SEALs using rebreathers conducted a combat swimmer attack on the Presidente Porras, a gunboat and yacht belonging to Manuel Noriega. The commandos attached explosives to the vessel as it was tied to a pier in the Panama Canal, escaping only after being attacked with grenades. Three years later during Operation Restore Hope, members of SEAL Team One swam to shore in Somalia to measure beach composition, water depth, and shore gradient ahead of a Marine landing. = Scientific diving = Before the development of scuba, scientists were making underwater observations of the marine environment using snorkels, freediving, and surface-supplied diving equipment. By the middle of the 20th century scientific diving was being done around the U.S. in surface supplied shallow water helmets and standard diving dress. During WWII Jacques Cousteau and Fr√©d√©ric Dumas used the Aqua-Lung for underwater archaeology to excavate a large mound of amphorae near Grand Conglou√©, an island near Marseilles. In 1949 Conrad Limbaugh introduced scientific scuba diving at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. While a doctoral student in 1954 he became Scripps' first diving safety officer, his research diving course was the first civilian diver training programme in the U.S. and he wrote the first scientific diving manual. Limbaugh and researcher Andreas Rechnitzer purchased an Aqua-lung when they became available, and taught themselves to use it, as no formal training was available. They introduced the equipment to Scripps researchers in 1950, and it was found suitable for making direct observations and to conduct experiments underwater. In 1951, after the death of two of their scientific divers, Scripps decided that there was a need for formalized scientific diver training, and in 1954 instituted the first formal scientific diving program in the U.S. At the request of the University of California Office of the President, the divers at Scripps developed the first \\"University Guide for Diving Safety,\\" which was initially published in March 1967. In the 1950s through 1970s scientific diving in the U.S. was conducted by various organizations using similar but informal self-regulated standards. In 1975 the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America petitioned for an emergency temporary standard be issued with respect to occupational diving operations. The ETS issued on June 15, 1976 was to be effective from July 15, 1976 but was challenged in the US Court of Appeals by several diving contractors, and was withdrawn in November 1976. A permanent standard for commercial diving became effective on 20 October 1977, but it did not consider the needs of scientific diving. The scientific diving community was unable to operate as previously, and in 1977 united to form the American Academy of Underwater Sciences (AAUS) After extensive negotiation and congressional hearings, a partial exemption to the commercial diving standards was issued in 1982, and was re-examined in 1984, leading to the final guidelines for the exemption which became effective in 1985 (Federal Register, Vol. 50, No. 6, p. 1046) Dr Richard Pyle has pioneered US development of diving standards for scientific projects at greater depths since the 1990s, using closed circuit rebreathers, which has opened up learning about an extended range of ecological zones and their biota. = Recreational diving = The invention of the aqua-lung in 1943 led to modern recreational diving Recreational scuba diving grew out of related activities such as snorkeling and underwater hunting. For a long time, recreational underwater excursions were limited by breath-hold time. The invention of the aqualung in 1943 by √âmile Gagnan and Jacques-Yves Cousteau and the wetsuit in 1952 by University of California, Berkeley physicist, Hugh Bradner and its development over subsequent years led to a revolution in recreational diving. However, for much of the 1950s and early 1960s, recreational scuba diving was a sport limited to those who were able to afford or make their own kit, and prepared to undergo relatively intensive training to use it. As the sport became more popular, manufacturers became aware of the potential market, and equipment began to appear that was easier to use, more affordable and more reliable. Continued advances in scuba technology, such as buoyancy compensators, improved diving regulators, wetsuits and improved dry suits, and dive computers, increased the safety, comfort and convenience of the equipment, and less intensive training programmes encouraged more people to learn to use it. Until the early 1950s, navies and other organizations performing professional diving were the only providers of diver training, and only for their own personnel and only using their own types of equipment. There were no formal training courses available to civilians who bought the early scuba equipment. The first recreational scuba diving school was opened in France to train the owners of the Cousteau and Gagnan designed twin-hose scuba. The first school to teach single hose scuba was started in 1953, in Melbourne, Australia, at the Melbourne City Baths. Royal Australian Navy Commander Batterham organized the school to assist the inventor of the single hose regulator, Ted Eldred. However, neither of these schools was international in nature. Some of the first civilian training started in 1952 at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography where Andy Rechnitzer, Bob Dill and Connie Limbaugh taught the first scuba courses in the United States, then in 1953 Trevor Hampton started the first British diving school, the British Underwater Centre and in 1954 when Los Angeles County created an Underwater Instructor Certification Course based on the training that they received from the scientific divers of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Early instruction developed in the format of amateur teaching within a club environment, as exemplified by organizations such as the Scottish Sub Aqua Club and the British Sub Aqua Club from 1953, Los Angeles County from 1954 and the YMCA from 1959. Professional instruction started in 1959 when the non- profit NAUI was formed, which later effectively was split, to form the for- profit PADI in 1966. The National Association of Scuba Diving Schools (NASDS) started with their dive center based training programs in 1962 followed by SSI in 1970. Professional Diving Instructors College was formed in 1965, changing its name in 1984 to Professional Diving Instructors Corporation (PDIC). In 2009 PADI alone issued approximately 950,000 diving certifications. Approximately 550,000 of these certifications were \\"entry level\\" certifications and the remainder were more advanced certifications. Scuba- diving has become a popular leisure activity, and many diving destinations have some form of dive shop presence that can offer air fills, equipment sale, rental and repair, and training. In tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world, there is a large market for 'holiday divers'; people who train and dive while on holiday, but rarely dive close to home. Technical diving and the use of rebreathers are increasing, particularly in areas of the world where deeper wreck diving is the main underwater attraction. Generally, recreational diving depths are limited by the training agencies to a maximum of between 30 and 40 meters (100 and 130 feet), beyond which a variety of safety issues such as oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis significantly increase the risk of diving using recreational diving equipment and practices, and specialized skills and equipment for technical diving are needed. =Solo diving= The history of solo diving stands in stark contrast to the relatively new concept of buddy diving that was developed for scientific and recreational diving in the mid-20th century. Artifacts dating back some 4,500 years provide evidence of solo diving for food and commerce by the ancient people of Mesopotamia. Freedivers traditionally dive alone or with an attendant on the surface to assist with the harvest; many of the early diving bells were only large enough for a single occupant. When surface supplied diving was first developed, it was common to have only one diver unless the work required more. Those early traditions continue and customarily include a standby diver, and a working diver who is in constant communication with the surface control crew. The sport of scuba diving is rooted in a multitude of small enthusiastic snorkeling and spearfishing clubs that date back to the decades just before and after World War II. In the late 1940s, after the invention of the Aqua- lung by Cousteau and Gagnan, the first retail underwater breathing apparatus for sport was commercially marketed. As the sport expanded through the 1950s, several sporting organisations ‚Äì notably the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) ‚Äì began scuba training programmes for swimming enthusiasts, thus began the codification of what was believed to be proper practices for the expanding amateur sport of scuba diving. The buddy system was thought to be a useful corollary to the \\"never swim alone\\" edicts of the YMCA swimming and lifesaving programmes. Cousteau independently implemented a buddy system after a number of harrowing diving incidents that date back to the earliest days of exploratory diving. The buddy system's useful aspects have long been established, including the cross-checking of equipment before dives, the facilitating of assistance for possible entanglement problems or equipment failures, and enhancement of the social nature of diving. The YMCA was a substantial influence in the development of diver certification during the first 50 years of the sport. As various scuba programmes were adopted by emerging scuba certification agencies, such as the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI), Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI), and British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC), the practise of buddy diving inspired one of the two main mantras of recreational scuba: \\"never hold your breath\\" and \\"never dive alone\\". By the early to mid-1990s, solo divers became more visible and increasingly open about their alternative dive safety philosophy, despite the recreational industry's established adherence to the buddy system. It wasn't until 2001 that Scuba Diving International (SDI) initiated formal certification training specifically for solo diving. Several other agencies eventually followed suit with certificates titled Self-reliant Diver and variations of that theme; all with the intention of improving diver competence without necessarily going solo, and recognising that the buddy system does not always comply with the ideal. At the 2012 \\"Rebreather Forum 3\\", a significant minority of attendees were of the opinion that, in some circumstances, it would be acceptable to dive solo on rebreathers. = Cave diving = The exploration of underwater parts of caves was started using surface supplied equipment before scuba became available. Jacques-Yves Cousteau, co-inventor of the first commercially successful open circuit scuba equipment, is claimed to have been the world's first open circuit scuba cave diver. Two regions have had particular influence on cave diving techniques and equipment due to their very different cave diving environments. These are the United Kingdom, and USA, mainly Florida.  UK history  The number of sites where standard diving dress could be used is limited and there was little progress before the outbreak of World War II reduced the caving community considerably. The development of underwater warfare made a lot of surplus equipment available after the war. The Cave Diving Group re-formed in 1946 and progress was rapid. Typical equipment at this time was a frogman rubber diving suit for insulation (water temperature in the UK is typically 4 ¬∞C), a closed circuit oxygen rebreather and an \\"Apparatus For Laying Out Line And Underwater Navigation\\", developed between 1946 qnd 1949. The \\"AFLOLAUN\\" consisted of battery powered lights, line-reel, compass, depth gauge, notebook (for the survey), and occasionally other equipment. Progress was typically by \\"bottom walking\\", as this was considered less dangerous than swimming in the absence of buoyancy control. The use of oxygen put a depth limit on the dives. This was the normal procedure until approximately 1960 when new techniques using wetsuits and open-circuit scuba sets were introduced. The development of side mounting cylinders, helmet-mounted lights and free-swimming with fins increased accessibility, and the increasing capacity and pressure rating of air cylinders extended dive durations. US history In the 1970s, cave diving greatly increased in popularity among divers in the United States. However, there were very few experienced cave divers and almost no formal classes to handle the surge in interest. The result was a large number of divers trying to cave dive without any formal training. This resulted in more than 100 fatalities over the course of the decade. The state of Florida came close to banning SCUBA diving around the cave entrances. The cave diving organizations responded to the problem by creating training programs and certifying instructors, in addition to other measures to try to prevent these fatalities. This included posting signs, adding no-lights rules, and other enforcements. The cave diving pioneer Sheck Exley explored many underwater cave systems in Florida, and elsewhere in the US and the rest of the world. On 6 February 1974, Exley became the first chairman of the Cave Diving Section of the National Speleological Society. Since the 1980s, cave diving education has greatly reduced diver fatalities, and it is now uncommon for a certified cave diver to die in an underwater cave. Also in the 1980s, refinements were made to the equipment used for cave diving, most importantly better lights with smaller batteries. In the 1990s, cave diving equipment configurations became more standardized, due mostly to the adaptation and popularization of the backplate and wing based \\"Hogarthian Rig\\", developed in North Florida, which keeps equipment configurations simple and streamlined. Documentary films made by Wesley C. Skiles and Jill Heinerth have contributed to the increasing popularity of cave diving in the early 21st century. = Diving on shipwrecks and other sunken structures = Wreck diving is recreational diving where the wreckage of ships, aircraft and other artificial structures are explored. Although most wreck dive sites are at shipwrecks, there is an increasing trend to scuttle retired ships to create artificial reef sites. Diving to crashed aircraft can also be considered wreck diving. The recreation of wreck diving makes no distinction as to how the vessel ended up on the bottom, and the purpose is for the entertainment of the diver. Some wreck diving involves penetration of the wreckage, making a direct ascent to the surface impossible for a part of the dive. The scientific discipline of underwater archaeology also involves diving on shipwrecks, but in this field, the intention is to collect data or preserve artifacts. Marine salvage is the recovery of wreckage, artifacts and material from shipwrecks and other underwater sites, for commercial reasons, to remove a navigational or ecological hazard, or because the artifacts or materials are perceived as having monetary or personal value other than scientific or historical. Commercial marine salvage may be restricted to the use of surface supplied diving equipment in some jurisdictions, but work is also done using scuba.

For her early work, she projected light on transparent sailing screens. The vocabulary of C√©cile Bart is projection of color in places, transparent screens that receive and diffuse the light, with the visitor being part of the devices. Her works are created according to the space in which they are presented. She uses as a manufacturing process a veil of Tergal that takes on a color with a brush. Depending on the number of layers, the color increases in intensity and becomes material. The veil is then stretched on an aluminum frame. For Mus√©e d'Art Contemporain du Val-de- Marne, she offered five color elements with as many frames. The visitor fits in the frame, so in the painting, and becomes surface that receives the color. In 2004, C√©cile Bart used fabric, for Toros, Lisses and Coulisses, sort of curtains alternating between open and closed. She also used the projection of films or photos. In 2017, C√©cile Bart offered silent show at the Centre de cr√©ation contemporaine Olivier Debr√©. This time, she used for this installation, painting, cinema and dance.

With the formation of Eastern Command and Northern Command additional Military Farm Units were established initially on adhoc basis and then regularised by the Indian government in 1993 as permanent Military Farm units.  Achievements  * Military Farms are pioneers in introduction of Artificial Insemination (AI) in cattle India. * The dairy development in the organized sector in India is attributed to Military Farms. * ‚ÄòProject Frieswal‚Äô, a project to develop a cross-bred cattle has become the world's largest cross-bred cattle breeding programme.  Decision to shut Military Farms  The Army decided to close down its military farms which house around 23,600 cattle with an annual production of over 33 million kg of milk, in two phases with the last farm shutting down by 2017. One of the reasons the decision was taken because it was seen that military farms were no longer needed due to the growing availability of quality milk and milk products in the civilian market. The personnel of the military farms will be progressively transferred to other wings and departments. All the farms are on defence land and these will be used for other defence purposes.

After, Ever After. The Brooklyn Rail. November 2016. She has exhibited extensively both nationally and internationally. She lives and works in New York City.  Education and work  Kretschmer received a MFA and BFA from the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, California. Over the course of 25 years, Kretschmer has maintained a rigorous practice of producing deceptively minimal paintings. Her works have been compared to valentines, reliquaries and hermetically sealed vaults.Eleanor Heartney. Saved by Abstraction. Art in America. February 2017. Kretschmer makes use of a variety of materials and techniques that work to redefine formal preconceptions associated with painting as a medium. Vellum, gesso, gouache, plywood and beeswax are among the materials Kretschmer inventively employs.Phyllis Tuchman. Painting After Postmodernism: Belgium-USA. Artforum. Vol. 55, No. 5, January 2017. Joining such materials to one another in the manner of collage, her process is one based in both improvisation and meticulousness. These fragments are often measured to a fraction of an inch, but Kretschmer firmly pushes back against precision in favor of accuracy.Catherine Corman. New Wave Women: Frieze. The Huffington Post. October 6, 2015. All of such deliberate gestures work to play with the experience of looking, and play with the viewer's perception of flatness and dimensionality.  Painting After Postmodernism: Belgium-USA  In 2016 Kretschmer's work was included in the group exhibition Painting After Postmodernism: Belgium-USA, curated by art historian, filmmaker, and curator Barbara Rose. The exhibition featured sixteen painters‚Äîhalf of them Americans, half Belgians, and was mounted at the historic Vanderborght building and Cin√©ma Galeries in Brussels. In this extensive survey, accompanied by a catalogue, Rose sought to encourage exchange and assert the need for a new discussion surrounding the condition of contemporary painting.Kat Herriman. Interviews: Barbara Rose. Artforum. September 2016. The American painters, including Larry Poons and Ed Moses, were primarily older, more established artists associated with Rose since the late 1960s in New York when a Clement Greenberg's \\"post-painterly\\" abstraction was giving way to multiform \\"pluralism.\\" Kretschmer and artist Martin Kline represented the relatively younger generation of process/image painters embodying the inheritance of this turn. For her work in the show, multiple pieces in a range of sizes, Kretschmer garnered considerable attention with one critic going so far to say that \\"stole the show.\\" In The New Criterion, Karen Wilkin described the experience of viewing Kretschmer's works in the exhibition:  Exhibitions  Kretschmer has had solo exhibitions in the United States at: The Boulder Museum of Art, Boulder; Lesley Heller Gallery, New York; Ace Gallery, Beverly Hills; Stark Gallery, New York; Westenburg, Marfa; Trans Hudson, New York; AMO Gallery, Los Angeles; Littlejohn/Sternau, New York; Fulcrum, New York; Julian Pretto, New York; Anne Plumb, New York.

Classifications  Fireworks being launched on Independence Day in Girsh Park in Goleta, California. Paravur Puttingal Temple's (India) Fireworks Competition. A major mishap happened here in April 2016, caused 110 deaths. EPCOT in Walt Disney World The United States government has classified fireworks and similar devices according to their potential hazards. = Current explosives classes = The U.S. government now uses the United Nations explosives shipping classification system, which is based on hazard in shipping only, while the old US system also covered use hazards. The BATFE and most states performed a direct substitution of Shipping Class 1.3 for Class B, and Shipping Class 1.4 for Class C. This allows some hazardous items that would have previously been classified as Class B and regulated to be classified as Shipping Class 1.4 due to some packaging method that confines any explosion to the package. Being Shipping Class 1.4, they can now be sold to the general public and are unregulated by the BATF. A code number and suffix (such as 1.3G) is not enough to fully describe a material and how it is regulated, especially in Shipping Class 1.4G. It also must have a UN Number that exactly describes the material. For example, common consumer fireworks are UN0336, or Shipping Class 1.4G UN0336. Here are some common fireworks classes: * Class 1.1G (Mass Explosion Possible:Pyrotechnics) UN0094 Flashpowder * Class 1.1G (Mass Explosion Possible:Pyrotechnics) UN0333 Fireworks (Salutes in bulk or in manufacture) * Class 1.2G (Projection but not mass explosion:Pyrotechnics) UN0334 Fireworks (Rarely used) * Class 1.3G (Fire, Minor Blast:Pyrotechnics) UN0335 Fireworks (Most Display Fireworks) Current federal law states that without appropriate ATF license/permit, the possession or sale of any display/professional fireworks is a felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison. ** Any ground salute device with over 50 milligrams of explosive composition ** Torpedoes (except for railroad signaling use) ** Multi-tube devices containing over 500 grams of pyrotechnic composition and without 1/2\\" space between each tube ** Any multiple tube fountains with over 500 grams of pyrotechnic composition and without 1/2\\" space between each tube ** Any reloadable aerial shells over 1.75\\" diameter ** Display shells ** Any single-shot or reloadable aerial shell/mine/comet/tube with over 60 grams of pyrotechnic composition ** Any Roman candle or rocket with over 20 grams of pyrotechnic composition ** Any aerial salute with over 130 milligrams of explosive composition * Class 1.4G (Minor Explosion Hazard Confined To Package:Pyrotechnics) UN0336 Fireworks (Consumer or Common Fireworks) Most popular consumer fireworks sold in the US. ** Reloadable aerial shells 1.75\\" or less sold in a box with not more than 12 shells and one launching tube ** Single-shot aerial tubes ** Bottle rockets ** Skyrockets and missiles ** Ground spinners, pinwheels and helicopters ** Flares & fountains ** Roman candles ** Smoke and novelty items ** Multi-shot aerial devices, or \\"cakes\\" ** Firecracker packs. Although some firecracker items may be called \\"M-80s\\", \\"M-1000s\\", \\"Cherry bombs\\" or \\"Silver Salutes\\" by the manufacturer, they must contain less than 50 milligrams of flash or other explosive powder in order to be legally sold to consumers in the United States. ** Sparklers ** Catherine wheel ** black snakes and strobes ** Mines * Class 1.4S (Minor Explosion Hazard Confined To Package: Packed As To Not Hinder Nearby Firefighters) UN0336 Fireworks (Consumer or Common Fireworks) * Class 1.4G (Minor Explosion Hazard Confined To Package:Pyrotechnics) UN0431 ARTICLES, PYROTECHNIC for technical purposes (Proximate Pyrotechnics) * Class 1.4S (Minor Explosion Hazard Confined To Package: Packed As To Not Hinder Nearby Firefighters) UN0432 ARTICLES, PYROTECHNIC for technical purposes (Proximate Pyrotechnics) Fireworks tubes are made by rolling thick paper tightly around a former, such as a dowel. They can be made by hand, most firework factories use machinery to manufacture tubes. Whenever tubes are used in fireworks, at least one end is always plugged with clay to keep both chemicals and burning gases from escaping through that end. The tooling is always made of non-sparking materials such as aluminium or brass. Experts at handling explosives, called pyrotechnicians, add chemicals for special effects. = Previous US DOT explosives classifications = Explosives, including fireworks, were previously divided into three classifications for transportation purposes by the US Department of Transportation (DOT). * Class A explosives included high explosives such as dynamite, TNT, blasting caps, packages of flash powder, bulk packages of black powder and blasting agents such as ANFO and other slurry types of explosives. * Class B explosives included low explosives such as \\"display fireworks\\" which were the larger and more powerful fireworks used at most public displays. * Class C explosives included other low explosives such as igniters, fuses and \\"common fireworks\\", which were the smaller and less powerful fireworks available for sale to and use by the general public. At the time most purchases and use of all of these explosives, with specific exceptions for high explosives purchased and used in state, black powder used for sporting purposes and common fireworks, required a license or permit to purchase and use from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF or BATFE), or the state, or a local authority.  Consumer fireworks safety  An example of a consumer firework in California Large fireworks retail shop in Pennsylvania Availability and use of consumer fireworks are hotly debated topics. Critics and safety advocates point to the numerous injuries and accidental fires that are attributed to fireworks as justification for banning or at least severely restricting access to fireworks. Complaints about excessive noise created by fireworks and the large amounts of debris and fallout left over after shooting are also used to support this position. There are numerous incidents of consumer fireworks being used in a manner that is supposedly disrespectful of the communities and neighborhoods where the users live. Meanwhile, those who support more liberal firework laws look at the same statistics as the critics and conclude that, when used properly, consumer fireworks are a safer form of recreation than riding bicycles or playing soccer.\\"Fireworks: safer than candles, tableware.\\" Dave Stoddard, Sacramento Ledger Dispatch, July 14, 2006. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has guidelines concerning the standard of consumer fireworks sold in the US. Together with US Customs, they are very proactive in enforcing these rules, intercepting imported fireworks that don't comply and issuing recalls on unacceptable consumer fireworks that are found to have \\"slipped through\\". Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is the federal agency that regulates explosives, including Display Fireworks in the US. But, ATF does not regulate consumer fireworks that conform to CPSC standards. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) as well as the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) have general jurisdiction over what types of fireworks may be legally sold in the United States. The federal law is only the minimum standard however, and each state is free to enact laws that are more stringent if they so choose. Many states have laws which further restrict access to and use of consumer fireworks. Stafford, Texas. Citing concerns over fireworks safety, some states, such as California, have enacted legislation restricting fireworks usage to devices that do not leave the ground, such as fountains. North Carolina limits fireworks to a charge of 200 grams of black powder. Massachusetts bans all consumer fireworks completely. Rhode Island, Arizona, New York, New Jersey, and Delaware have passed bills legalizing certain types of small fireworks. Vermont only allows sparklers. On the other hand, states such as Maine, South Dakota, South Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee allow most or all legal consumer fireworks to be sold and used throughout the year. New Mexico in some cases, will not allow fireworks from individual residents if the fireworks are said to detonate over in height. Some states such as New Jersey vigorously enforce them. Each year, there are many raids on individuals suspected of illegally possessing fireworks. Illinois only permits sparklers, snake/glow worm pellets, smoke devices, trick noisemakers, and plastic or paper caps. However, many users travel to neighboring states such as Indiana, Missouri, Kentucky, and Wisconsin to obtain fireworks for use in Illinois. This situation is similar to the plight of many St. Louis residents as fireworks are illegal within both city and county limits. However, fireworks are readily available in nearby St. Charles County. Differences in legislation among states have led to many fireworks suppliers setting up shop along state borders, to sell to customers from neighboring states where fireworks are restricted. Some Native American tribes on reservation lands sell fireworks that are not legal for sale outside the reservation. The type of fireworks sold in the United States range from those permitted under federal law to illegal explosive devices and professional fireworks sold on the black market. Both the illicit manufacture and diversion of illegal explosives to the consumer market have become a growing problem in recent years.  Display fireworks safety  Federal, state, and local authorities govern the use of display fireworks in the United States. At the federal level, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) sets forth a set of codes which give the minimum standards of display fireworks use and safety in the US. Both state and local jurisdictions can further add restrictions on the use and safety requirements of display fireworks. Typically, these jurisdictions will require a licensed operator to discharge the show. Although requirements vary from state to state, licensed operators and their crew are typically required to have hours of extensive training in the Safe use of display fireworks. These codes can include, but are not limited to, distance from the audience, maximum size shell, firing location requirements, electrical firing system requirements, and the minimum safety gear to be worn by the fireworks crew. These guidelines are explained in the NFPA 1123 fireworks code.

They had only been legally accused of the crime a few minutes before they were kidnapped from the courthouse, chained to trees, and tortured with a blow torch. Following the torture, McDaniels was shot to death and Townes was burned alive. Pictures taken, prior to Townes being lit on fire, were the first lynching photographs to be published by the national press: they were reprinted in Time Magazine and Life Magazine, and then in national newspapers. Duck Hill In December 1936, the greater rural Duck Hill area had a population of about 2,750, while the town of Duck Hill had fewer than 550 inhabitants, with the greater Duck Hill area accounting for under 20 percent of Montgomery County's population. The town of Duck Hill accounted for a little over 3 percent of the county's population, respectively. The county had recently commenced the first legal hanging in its history six months prior, when Wilson Pullen, a white man, was convicted of murdering his landlord, Dave McClelland. Pullen was the first white man to hang in the state \\"in several years.\\" The County also had experienced two murders, in three months, across its 20-mile radius. At the time, the state of Mississippi led the country in homicides. At 26.2, its homicide rate was the first state to cross the \\"25\\" rate mark ever, and its 512 homicides were more than the total number of homicides in 15 states combined. Nearly 80 percent of those murdered were black. A number of the state's murders were recorded as \\"trivialities\\" between known persons, including a disagreement over five cents, an argument over the cutting of a birthday cake, and a disagreement over killing a rabbit. In almost half of the murders, whiskey was involved. In August 1936 over 300 gallons of moonshine was confiscated from Montgomery County ‚Äì‚Äì it was on record as being the largest such confiscation in the state. At the time, while the average per capita income for the nation was about $575 per year (approximately $10,500 in 2019), it was just over $215 (approximately $4,000 in 2019) for Mississippi, ranking the state last in the country. Per capita income in Montgomery County is estimated to have been about 20 percent less than the average for the state, while Duck Hill's per capita income was estimated to have been 30 percent less than the average for the county. The estimated average income per capita of blacks in Montgomery County was more than 30 percent less than whites. And more than 25 percent of black adults in the area were illiterate, where the state spent five times more on white school children than black children, and where black children only spent an average of 15‚Äì20 weeks a year in school as they were often relegated to helping their sharecropping families. The Montgomery County Sheriff, Edgar E. Wright, had a 7th-grade education. The sheriff in the adjacent county of Grenada, D.W. Dogan, had a 10th-grade education. Crime On December 30, 1936, George Sam Windham, a 40-year-old crossroads county grocer, was standing in the back of his store, six miles east of Duck Hill, Mississippi, eating sardines and crackers for dinner. Windham was \\"mysteriously\\" shot with a 12-gauge shotgun, allegedly through the store's window screen. However, at least one newspaper reported that Windham was shot in front of his store. The discharge hit his right shoulder and neck. He was still alive when he was found, but died en route when taken to get medical attention. Investigation On December 31, the day after the murder, Sheriff Edgar E. Wright stated that Windham's store had been \\"ransacked\\" and his pockets had been \\"turned wrong-side out\\". It was reported that Windham's cash register had been robbed of $350 ($6,500 in 2019); though by April, that amount would be adjusted down to $200 (about $3,700 in 2019). Bloody footprints were also found in the store. Sheriff Wright went on record stating that the footprints were the only clues to the murderer found in the store. However, Sheriff Wright would later state that he did not believe the \\"footprints or any of the evidence found in the store at that time, to be worthwhile.\\" It was never clarified as to whether the bloody footprints were, in fact, those of Windham's in his own blood. Windham lived with his family in the rear of the store, but he reportedly was alone when he was attacked. His wife and two children were said to be \\"away\\" for the Christmas holidays. On January 1, the Jackson Police, along with bloodhounds, were called on to assist. In addition, broken glass and Windham's cash register were sent to a lab for fingerprints to be lifted. Jackson Police Inspector Audis E. Crawford maintained that \\"good [fingerprint] impressions would be obtained.\\" However, the authorities did not state any speculated circumstance for the broken glass though Windham had reportedly been shot \\"through the window screen\\". That same day, Sherriff Wright labeled \\"robbery\\" as the motive of the murder. Sheriff Wright also declared: Later that day, two black brothers, Alvie and T.L. Dorrah, were arrested after the bloodhounds reportedly \\"followed a trail from the scene of the crime to their house some distance away.\\" One of the brothers had been in Windham's store on the day of the murder. Despite admitting there was \\"no direct connection\\" between the brothers and the murder, Sheriff Wright \\"held them for investigation.\\" Alvie and T.L.'s brother, Elijah, was also arrested after Deputy Sheriff, George Blaylock claimed to have found a \\"muddy gun\\" in Elijah's home, which was reportedly the same type used in the killing. Blaylock did not state what type of gun he found in Elijah's home, only that the \\"bullets\\" for the gun didn't match those used in the murder. However, a 12-gauge shotgun accepts all 12-gauge shells. Blaylock did not state why the found gun, and the \\"bullets\\" used in the murder, did not match. Elijah's friend, 21-year-old, Joe Ed McDaniels, was also arrested with Elijah. The two were arrested because they were inhabiting a house close to Elijah's brothers, which happened to be \\"where the bloodhounds ended their trail.\\" Sheriff Wright handed Elijah and Joe Ed to George Windham's brother, Gus, allowing him to have unaccounted for time with the men. Gus Windham would later drop the men off at the neighboring county jail in Grenada, where Elijah and Joe Ed ‚Äì‚Äì who maintained that they \\"didn't know nothing\\" about the crime and calling Windham, \\"a fine man\\" ‚Äì‚Äì reportedly declined to be in a cell together. No charges were placed on the four men, and Sheriff Wright stated that he would keep them detained \\"indefinitely.\\" On January 3, a report began circulating that a white man had been arrested in connection with the murder. However, Sherriff Wright dismissed that report and stated that Alvie Dorrah was the \\"number one suspect.\\" Maintaining his innocence, Dorrah cried and reiterated that black people in the area loved \\"Mr. Sam\\" [Windham].\\" He pleaded, \\"Heaven knows I'm innocent.\\" That same day, Sheriff Wright stated that there were other people \\"under suspicion\\" and that he \\"expected a break [in the case] soon.\\" Wright also reiterated his belief that the crime was premeditated and \\"committed by a person familiar entirely with Windham's store and habits.\\" In the four weeks following the crime, eight black men had been detained without charges, six of whom were held in jail for at least two weeks. In addition to Joe Ed McDaniels, and Alvie, T.L. and Elijah Dorrah, 55-year-old Leroy Weldon, and 35-year-old Bit Reed, were detained for several weeks because they were \\"in the vicinity\\" of Duck Hill on the night of the murder searching for some cows that had strayed. On January 23, Townes' 24-year-old brother-in-law, Jess Mack, was also arrested and detained for \\"harboring a fugitive\\" when stating that his brother-in-law had visited with him in the time since Windham had been killed. In addition, on January 29, a black man was detained by police officers in New York City because he \\"fit the description\\" of Townes. However, Sheriff Wright shifted the focus onto Roosevelt Townes, a 25-year-old black man. Townes had reportedly escaped from the Grenada County Jail ‚Äì‚Äì with a white fellow prisoner ‚Äì‚Äì two weeks (or three days) prior to the murder, where he had been imprisoned for allegedly stealing corn. Roosevelt Townes Roosevelt \\"Red\\" Townes was originally from Hernando, Mississippi. However, in December 1936, the 25-year-old was living with his wife five miles north of Duck Hill in Elliot, where he had recently contracted with 67-year-old Micajah Purnell Sturdivant ‚Äì‚Äì a white man from Vance ‚Äì‚Äì to be a sharecropper on Sturdivant's property. Sturdivant's plantation was overseen by a 25-year-old white man, Howard Prestage. Prestage claimed to have become \\"suspicious\\" of Townes after determining that Townes had more money on him than he thought Townes should have. Prestage did not state this suspicious amount. However, Prestage allegedly contacted Sheriff D.W. Dogan, of Grenada County, about the money. Dogan immediately ordered Prestage to arrest Townes. Prestage approached and accused Townes, ordering another black man to search Townes while Prestage held a gun on him. However: Prestage claimed to have shot at Townes, several times, but missed. It was reported that, on the night that Townes ran, he snuck back on the property to get his wife, officially making them both fugitives. However, given Townes had allegedly escaped from prison, and murdered Windham days earlier, it was not reconciled how he \\"became\\" a fugitive when he already was a fugitive. At some point, Sheriff Edgar E. Wright became adamant that Townes \\"had something to do it\\" [Windham's murder]. However, he did not state what led him to that conclusion. For example, he stated no connection between Townes and Windham or, given most blacks did not have cars or access to them at the time, state how Townes would have been in the car the neighbors allegedly heard. However, on January 19, Townes was officially accused of the crime. A $500 reward was offered for his capture. On January 20, The Clarion-Ledger printed that unnamed \\"officers\\" said that \\"circumstantial evidence pointed strongly to Townes being the murderer.\\" It was never stated when Townes was arrested for corn theft, or how long he remained in jail before escaping. It was not reported as to why Mr. Prestage was not aware his employee was a fugitive if Townes had allegedly escaped jail more than two weeks before Mr. Prestage called the police. It also was not reported from whom, or from where, Sheriff Wright thought Townes allegedly stole the gun. No murder weapon was ever reported found. Nor was the name, or existence, of the accomplice \\"other negro\\" ever reported. Conversely, while on January 20, it was reported that Townes had escaped jail two weeks before the murder, the timing contradicted with the April 6, by the same newspaper, which stated that Townes escaped \\"just three days\\" before the murder. Kidnapping Sheriff Edgar E. Wright obtained a \\"small Kodak 10-cent snapshot of Townes\\" and sent it to the Jackson Bureau of Investigation where \\"the tiny picture was enlarged.\\" One hundred copies were printed and sent them to \\"all police departments around the south.\\" on April 2, Townes was allegedly found in Memphis. The Memphis Police Department arrested him and attributed the following confession to him: On April 5, the Memphis Police Department then released him to the Jackson Police Department for \\"safekeeping,\\" with its \\"mob-proof\\" county jail. On April 6, Sheriff Wright claimed that, while Townes was in his custody, Townes had confessed to shooting Windham. Six days later, Sheriff Wright brought Townes to the county jail, in Winona, where Townes would wait until he was to be arraigned. At some point, an acquaintance of Townes', Robert \\"Bootjack\\" McDaniels ‚Äì‚Äì described as \\"a lanky negro with powerful shoulders ‚Äì‚Äì was accused along with him. Authorities reported no evidence or reason for McDaniels' arrest. The county brought retroactive indictments against both men, effectively dating their indictments as December 30, 1936. Sheriff Wright did not request aid from the Governor in guarding the two men. Rather, on April 13, the two men were brought to the white brick courthouse around 11:15 am by Sheriff Wright and four deputies ‚Äì‚Äì Deputy Sheriffs Hugh Curtis and Shed Castles, and deputies Winston Blakely and McGurrah. Townes and McDaniels, unable to afford attorneys, were appointed three local attorneys to represent them ‚Äì‚Äì John E. Aldridge, Vernon D. Rowe, and W.D. Davis ‚Äì‚Äì and stood before Judge John Allen, in Winona. Both men pleaded \\"not guilty. The judge then adjourned \\"for dinner\\" at 11:45 a.m. It was stated that, following the arraignment, there was \\"no sign of violence;\\" however, it was also reported that, upon the judge calling for recess, the \\"crowd hurriedly left the courtroom.\\" Townes and McDaniels had only been legally accused of the crime a few moments when Sheriff Wright handcuffed them together. Wright and his four deputies left the courtroom \\"at once,\\" to allegedly take the men back to jail, when Sheriff Wright claimed to have been met at the north door of the courthouse by a mob of about 100 men \\"milling about the courtyard\\" who said: \\"Let's get them.\\" Sheriff Wright stated that \\"they [the lynch mob] took me and my deputies by complete surprise.\\" Deputy Sheriffs, Curtis and Castles, claimed that they were \\"overpowered\\" by the mob. Curtis claimed that he, Sheriff Wright, and deputies Blakely and McGurrah, were incapacitated by six men who tied their hands behind their backs. The lawmen claimed that they were \\"helpless,\\" despite admitting none of them had drawn their weapons as the mob came up, and admitting that they didn't follow after Townes and McDaniels after the mob had taken them. Attorney Rowe stated that Sheriff Wright was somehow able to come back into the courthouse and make his way to the jury room ‚Äì‚Äì where Rowe had allegedly gone following the judge calling for recess ‚Äì‚Äì and tell him that \\"the two negroes have been taken away from us by a mob.\\" Rowe claimed to have immediately looked for Judge Allen. Rowe stated that he ran out the front of the courthouse, where he saw Judge Allen \\"going to his hotel\\" and told him what Sheriff Wright told him. Rowe did not state why he thought the judge could be of help where five armed police officers were \\"helpless.\\" During the commotion, District Attorney Clarence Morgan stated that he watched the mob from his window: Townes and McDaniels were handcuffed and placed on a waiting school bus, where 15 white men crowded onto the bus with them. The bus was driven north, along Highway 51, exiting on Alva-Duck Hill Road. They drove another six miles, to a wooded area about a mile from Windham's store, with a caravan of people following, and a lengthening procession of about 40 cars joining along the way. When the bus stopped, about 200 yards off the main road, \\"there were already many cars stopped and occupants unloaded\\" waiting in a patch of pinewood for them to arrive. Lynching Robert McDaniels lynched. Apr. 13, 1937 While Townes and McDaniels were held on the bus, white men had placed chains around their necks and bound the two men together. In the woods, a mob estimated to number 500 people ‚Äì‚Äì including women and children ‚Äì‚Äì watched as Townes and McDaniels were dragged from the bus, stripped of their shirts to their waists, and chained to two trees. One of the mob members brought out a \\"white-hot\\" plumbers blow torch, applying \\"the blue-white flame\\" to the bare skin of Townes and McDaniels while demanding, \\"Tell all you know!\\" The Sheriff claimed that, under torture, Townes \\"readily\\" confessed to shooting Windham through the window, but said that McDaniels was the mastermind of the alleged robbery. Allegedly, Townes asked the mob to tie McDaniels up next to him and torture him the same way. The mob proceeded to do so, demanding that McDaniels confess. McDaniels maintained his innocence after being seared with the blow torch several times. However, after a few minutes of torture, he allegedly \\"came clean.\\" Conversely, under torture, McDaniels allegedly stated that Townes had killed Windham and was framing him, that he barely knew Townes and hadn't seen him in two years. He reportedly also confessed to being inside the store when Windham was killed, and then to robbing the store. The mob made him sign a confession that the robbery was planned four months in advance. He signed his name with an \\"X.\\" It was not reported as to whether McDaniels or Townes were literate. The mob shot McDaniels numerous times, including a shot through his head that ultimately killed him. The mob then turned its attention onto Townes, described by officers as a \\"dangerous negro,\\" who was then tied around an oak tree roughly a foot in diameter. Though having just witnessed McDaniels' death, and \\"signed\\" the confession, Townes still stated his innocence. However, \\"the blowtorch burned the story out of him.\\" He began screaming to his torturers to please kill him. However, while the mob had him under duress, they \\"allowed\\" him to confess to other unsolved crimes in the area, including the burning of houses and the theft of livestock. Both men were dead by 1:00pm. Their bodies were left hanging, strapped to the trees, for \\"hours,\\" and were not removed until that night. The coroner would later state, on Townes' death certificate, that he was \\"burned to a crisp.\\" The mob claimed that the Townes and McDaniels, under torture, implicated another black man in Windham's killing, \\"Shorty\\" Dorrah, who lived nearby. One account said, during the lynching, several white men went to his home, abducted him, and brought him back to the wooded area. However, another account stated that the mob had kidnapped Dorrah \\"on the way to the lynching.\\" Both accounts stated that Dorrah pled his innocence, but the mob severely beat and horsewhipped him: Later that night, Jackson Police Inspector, Audis E. Crawford, wrote to the F.B.I. stating that Townes' file had been \\"permanently disposed of.\\" Aftermath Sheriff Wright said that the mob was \\"unexpected,\\" and that while he pleaded with the mob \\"to let the law take its course.\\" Deputy Sherriff, Hugh Curtis, stated the lynching took place in a \\"quickly, quietly and orderly\\" fashion. The mob was also reported to be \\"highly organized\\" and was said to have executed the lynchings \\"in a jiffy.\\" However, his statement was at odds at newspaper accounts of the lynching, in which it was called \\"a slow process.\\" His statements, of how Townes and McDaniels were forcibly taken from the custody of him and his sheriffs, was also in conflict with Time Magazine's report, which stated that Townes and McDaniels were taken from the sheriff and his deputies \\"without a struggle.\\" Sheriff Wright, along with his deputies stated that, although the mob was unmasked, they did not recognize any of the participants. However District Attorney, Clarence Morgan contradicted their statements when he said that Sheriff Wright told him that the mob was \\"from some other county.\\" Morgan, who stated that \\"the mob just came on us like an April shower,\\" later said he was \\"confident none of the parties in the mob was from Montgomery County\\"...and specified that he had information that the mob came from the counties of \\"Grenada, Carroll, and probably from Webster and Tallahatchie.\\" Local newspaper, The Greenwood Commonwealth, pointed out that three of the four districts Morgan named were in his district and stated that Morgan had a duty to name any mob members if he knew them. Governor Hugh L. White initially issued an order to send the Mississippi National Guard from Grenada to the scene; but rescinded the order once he deemed the lynching was already over. Under national pressure, Governor White said he would \\"personally investigate\\" the lynchings, then called on District Attorney Morgan to make a formal investigation. However, the lynchings had widespread support around Mississippi, and the Governor's investigation call was treated as little more than a formality. For example, when praising the lynchings for saving the state money in court costs, The Enterprise-Tocsin editorial stated: The Governor never requested Morgan to report his findings to him. However, he later delegated Sheriff Wright and his deputies to report their findings to him. But, Sheriff Wright said that due to the amount of court work that needed his attention, he was \\"not able to concentrate his efforts\\" on the lynching. Governor White did not state what he would do if the Sheriff refused or failed to investigate the lynchings. Weeks before Townes and Roosevelt were killed, Mississippi led the nation in lynchings, accounting for over 525 of the 4,820 on record since 1882. However, moments before the lynching occurred, Governor White boasted, at a Farm Chemurgic Conference in Jackson, that there had not been a lynching in the state in 15 months.\\"Roosevelt Townes and Robert \\"Bootjack\\" McDaniels\\", Northeastern University's Center for Civil Rights and Restorative Justice; News Articles: \\"Dual Lynching Nationally Condemned\\" and \\"Mob Lynches Two Negroes Tuesday near Duck Hill\\" , Winona Times, 15 April 1937; accessed 18 March 2017 The day after the lynching, the governor later joked: No one was ever charged with the abductions or murders. The identities of Windham's neighbors, who were said to have heard the car, the shot, and Windham's groans, were never reported; nor was it reported how close these neighbors lived to the store given that they allegedly heard the car and Windham's moans. The lab results of the cash register's fingerprints, and bloody footprints, were never reported on beyond January 3. While Sheriff Wright twice stated his belief that the crime had been \\"committed by a person familiar entirely with Windham's store and habits,\\" it was never reported that any family members of Windham's were ever questioned or considered as suspects, specifically George Windham's brother, Gus, given Sheriff Wright had given him access to black men who stood accused of the crime. It was also not elaborated why the suspect(s) was deemed to be black, or how any black person in the area, specifically Townes and McDaniels, would have been \\"familiar entirely with Windham's store and habits,\\" or would have been aware that his family was away at the time. It was also not elaborated as to why Townes was suspected, when the white prisoner he was said to have escaped prison with, was not. It was not stated whether Windham's murder was connected with the other two recent murders in the area. Nor was a murder weapon ever found. Despite such discrepancies, after the lynching, it would be retroactively reported that Townes had been the prime suspect since the day after the murder. Significance On April 26, 1937, Time and Life magazines published a photograph of McDaniels' body chained to a tree. It was the first time an image of lynching had been published nationally. Other newspapers later published the image. In 1955, the picture appeared in the popular Museum of Modern Art exhibition, The Family of Man, an exhibition \\"to capture ‚Äúthe gamut of life from birth to death.\\" The photo appeared under the title: \\"Death Slump at Mississippi Lynching (1937).\\" It was estimated to have been seen by more than 180,000 visitors in New York, however after receiving criticism of the photo for being \\"too powerful, too striking and causing visitors to pause and gaze, thus interrupting the flow of the movement and the flow of the message,\\" curator Edward Steichen withdrew the image eleven weeks after the show opened:Zamir, Shamoon, 'Structures of Rhyme, Forms of Participation: The Family of Man as Exhibition', in Hurm, Gerd, 1958-, (editor.); Reitz, Anke, (editor.); Zamir, Shamoon, (editor.)

Nazis condemn lynchings Internationally, German newspapers publicized the murders to support Nazi government propaganda, contrasting the violence of the lynchings to the \\"humane\\" Nuremberg racial laws that the Reich had passed against Jewish citizens. The lynchings had also occurred at the moment that the House of Representatives was debating Rep. Joseph Gavagan's (D-New York) anti-lynching legislation. The outrage helped gain support for anti-lynching legislation that he introduced. The legislation was supported in the Senate by Democrats Robert F. Wagner (New York) and Frederick Van Nuys (Indiana). The legislation eventually passed in the House, despite 85 percent of the 123 Representatives from the South, voting against it. However, the powerful Solid South of white Democrats blocked it in the Senate, as they had blocked all previous anti- lynching bills.

They are the Double-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres. Their home games are played at Hodgetown in downtown Amarillo. History On June 21, 2017, David G. Elmore, president of Elmore Sports Group, announced the relocation of the San Antonio Missions Double-A franchise to Amarillo in 2019, with the team set to compete in the Texas League under a new nickname. This move was part of a larger relocation wherein the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Pacific Coast League relocated to San Antonio in 2019, continuing the use of the Missions nickname at the Triple-A level, and the Helena Brewers of the rookie level Pioneer League moved to Colorado Springs. The organization officially states that team's name was decided in a name-the-team contest. Five finalists were selected: \\"Boot Scooters,\\" \\"Bronc Busters,\\" \\"Jerky,\\" \\"Long Haulers,\\" and \\"Sod Poodles.\\" The names received negative feedback from locals over their absurd nature, but the team indicated their intention to adopt an unusual, family- friendly name. Brandiose, a branding firm in San Diego, were asked to create a new identity for the team. Their staff selected the Sod Poodles name after visiting Amarillo and researching its history. The name is in reference to the prevalence of prairie dogs in West Texas. The name was meant to convey the values of sticking together, being family oriented, and self sufficient. Amarillo's home ballpark was named Hodgetown in honor of Amarillo pharmacist, businessman, philanthropist, and 26th Mayor of Amarillo Jerry Hodge. The Sod Poodles played their first game, a 5‚Äì2 loss, on April 4, 2019, against the Corpus Christi Hooks at Whataburger Field in Corpus Christi. Their first win came the next evening when they defeated the Hooks, 7‚Äì5. The winning run was scored in the top of the seventh inning when Matthew Batten tripled and later scored on a Buddy Reed single. In their inaugural home opener on April 8, the Sod Poodles lost to the Midland RockHounds, 9‚Äì4 in 10 innings. The opener was attended by 7,175 people. In the 2019 Texas League South Series, the Sod Poodles fell behind 2 games to none against the Midland RockHounds, before winning 3 straight games in Midland to advance to the Championship Series against the Tulsa Drillers, who defeated the Arkansas Travelers 3 games to 2. In the 2019 Championship Series, Amarillo won game 1 by a score of 13-6 at Hodgetown, while falling 18-9 in game 2. As the series shifted to Tulsa, the Drillers took a 2 games to 1 in game 3 with a 2-0 win. The Sod Poodles battled back with a game 4 victory by a score of 3-0. In game 5, the Sod Poodles were down 3-1 in the top of the ninth before Taylor Trammell hit a grand slam to take a lead that the Sod Poodles would never relinquish, en route to a Texas League championship in their inaugural season.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The building has been converted into apartments, now known as the Flats on the River. History In 1860, Hiram H. Belding and his brother Alva N. Belding started selling spooled silk from a base in what is now Belding, aided by a third brother, Milo M. Belding, who living in Ashfield, Massachusetts. This retail trade was an immense success, and in 1866 Belding Brothers began manufacturing silk thread in Rockville, Connecticut. By 1872 they had established a second mill in Northampton, Massachusetts, and soon added other facilities in California and Montreal. In 1886, Belding Brothers returned to Belding and constructed this mill, designated Mill #1. However, soon after completing the building, they had doubts about the success of the venture and sold it to George Richardson of Chicago, Illinois, who had previously worked for Belding Brothers as an office manager. However, despite their doubts, the Richardson Mill was immediately successful. Belding Brothers established a second mill in Belding in 1890, quickly followed by two more. In 1898, Richardson expanded his mill with a substantial addition, and all four mills operated simultaneously for some time. In 1910, Belding Brothers re- purchased the Richardson Mill. They operated it until 1925, when they sold the company to an eastern consortium. The new corporation, Belding-Heminway, continued to operate the Belding mills until 1932, when they were closed. The Richardson Silk Mill was used by a series of manufacturing firms, including the manufacture of down-filled sporting goods in the 1970s. By the early 1980s, the structure was vacant. In 1986, it was converted into apartments, now known as the Flats on the River. Description The Richardson Silk Mill is a four-story building constructed of whitish brick with a slant roof on a concrete foundation. It was constructed in two sections: the 1888 section measures 50 feet by 250 feet, and the 1898 addition measures 50 feet by 100 feet. The original section contains two five-story brick towers with pyramidal slate roofs, and has regularly spaced arched windows with decorative belt courses of red brick running between the windows and forming arches. The addition has a similar window structure, but without the decorative brick. A two-story white brick addition is attached to the rear of the building.

Regarded as one of the fathers of Chinese oil painting, Fang was born in the Wenling county, Zhejiang province. He began studying painting in 1924 and went to Paris in 1925, enrolling in the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, making him, along with Xu Beihong and Sanyu, one of the first Chinese painters to study abroad in France. Upon returning to China, he taught at the National Arts Academy, Hangzhou, becoming a professor at the Western Painting Department. During the Cultural Revolution, Fang was shamed and tortured by the Red Guards, and his works were destroyed. He died in 1984. His students include Zao Wou-Ki, Chu Teh-Chun and Wu Guanzhong. left right  Timeline  In 1906, Fang Ganmin was born in Wenling, Zhejiang on February 15. His father, Fang Yue (also known as Xun Cheng), was an official literary degree holder, who majored in the study of written characters and published several books including \\"A Simple Approach to The Study of The Six Classes of Characters\\". In 1920, Fang attended Andin High School in Hangzhou, gradually showing his talent in art. In 1924, he went to Shanghai in the summer to apply for the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts and was accepted to the second level where he was educated with a solid drawing foundation under the direction of Russian teacher V. Podgursky. In 1925, he left Shanghai for France to further his studies. In 1926, after learning the French language at a town outside Paris for six months, Fang was accepted into an art school in Lyon where he took \\"Paster Casts\\" and \\"Future drawing\\" classes. In 1927, Fang attended √âcole des Beaux-Arts de Paris and joined Jean- Paul Laurens' studio, together with Yan Wenliang. Apart from taking drawing lessons at the studio, he was also a frequent visitor of galleries and museums and developed a strong interest in post-impressionism. In 1929, he married Ms. Ai Lan Su, his fellow schoolmate at √âcole des Beaux-Arts, in Paris. He returned to China in the winter and was hired by the Shanghai Private Xin Hua Fine Arts Academy, but later transferred to Shanghai Fine Arts University and Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts.  Career  Fang Ganmin studied in Shanghai Meizhuan and under Jean-Pierre Laurens (1875‚Äì1932), son of Jean-Paul Laurens (1838 ‚Äì 1921), at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, from 1926 to 1929, together with Chinese artists such as Yan Wenliang. He taught in Xinhua AFA, Shanghai, and Hangzhou Academy. In or around 1930, Fang Ganmin, along with artists such as Xu Shaozeng, Guo Guni, Li Jingfa and Zhu Yingpeng, founded the Changfeng Society for the Study of Western Paintings. In 1951 and 1952, a campaign against modernist art, condemned in Soviet terms as both bourgeois and formalist, had forced Lin Fengmian and Wu Dayu to leave the art academy in Hangzhou and return to Shanghai. Realism was deemed the progressive style. Fang Ganmin managed to remain, but was nonetheless marginalised and condemned for his modern styles. During the Cultural Revolution, Fang, branded an anti-revoluntary for his modernist artistic style, was paraded around the National Academy of Art in Hangzhou, ink and paint poured over him as students beat and denounced him. Fang was also imprisoned by the Red Guards for long periods. Works left Of Fang's early paintings, two are particularly noteworthy. They are exercises in the Cubist manner, and give to their subject, both nudes, the geometrical and sculptural, but not the fragmented, effect of a picture by Braque. One of them is Melody in Autumn (1934). The other is \\"White Doves\\" (1932), which portrays geometric shapes suggestive of Cubism, but with a Art Deco-like structural undertone. In jest, his students called his style fang (‚Äòsquare‚Äô), punning on his surname Fang, which also happens to be one of the characters of the Chinese word for ‚Äòcubic‚Äô.

As critic Jonathan Goodman remarked: Mozenter has taught at Pratt Institute (1985-2015), Cooper Union (2001), and at Parsons School of Design (1994-1997).  Exhibitions and commissions  Mozenter has had solo exhibitions at Lesley Heller Gallery, New York; Garrison Art Center, Garrison, NY; Adam Baumgold Gallery, New York; The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Ridgefield, CT; Dieu Donn√© Papermill, New York; The Drawing Center, New York; and Espa√ßo Cultural Municipal S√©rgio Porto, Rio de Janeiro. Her work has been included in group exhibitions at the Neuberger Museum of Art, Purchase, NY; The Drawing Center, New York; Lesley Heller Gallery, New York; the Asheville Art Museum, Asheville, NC; among others. In 1995 Mozenter was commissioned to create an installation in conjunction with the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra's Orientalism series for the Majestic Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.  Grants and fellowships  Mozenter is the recipient of fellowships from the New York Foundation for the Arts (2001, 1986); The Fifth Floor Foundation Grant (2005, 2001); The Coby Foundation (2005); Pratt Institute Faculty Development Grant (2012, 2009, 2001, 1996); Dieu Donn√© Papermill, Artist Sponsorship Program (2001); and Artists Space Artist Grant (1985, 1988).

The aircraft was a variant of the predecessor K-1 with a stronger engine and an all-metal construction. The total weight of the construction exceeded that of the planning considerably. The first flight took place in 1926. The assembly was more complex than the K-1, but only four were built.  Development  Kalinin was assigned to the yard of the airline Ukrovsdukhput after the registration of the K-1 design in Kharkiv as a construction site. The yard was then renamed GROS (Graschdanskoje Opytnoje Samoleostrojenie, pilot aircraft construction for civil aviation). Shortly thereafter, it was referred to only as a \\"series work\\". Here Kalinin gathered his best employees around and planned the further development of the K-1. The planning group included I. G. Neman, S. I. Iskovich, A. J. Shcherbakov, and W. J. Krilow.  Construction  The fuselage consisted of a welded tubular steel framework and was clad with light-alloy sheet metal from Koltschug aluminum. The construction was designed as a high wing monoplane whose wings were braced to the lower part of the trunk body. The wings had an elliptical shape and were, like the tail, made of tubular steel and also covered with light metal sheets. The tail had a normal shape (tail fins strutted to the fuselage). All control surfaces were covered with fabric. The chassis was fixed and provided with a continuous axle. At the rear of the fuselage was a sprung tailspur. The pilot sat in a closed cabin. Variants ;K-2: refined K-1 first flown in 1926, used by Ukrovsdukhput ;K-3: Ambulance variant of the K-2 with accommodation for one doctor with 2 stretcher patients or four seated patients.

It is the only church in the Diocese of Llandaff to conduct its services exclusively in the Welsh language. Location The church is situated in the centre of a tree-lined oval green and is the focus of St Andrew's Crescent, just north of the city centre. History St Andrew's Crescent was laid out as a formal space in the 1850s by the trustees of the Bute Estate, with the intention of having a church at its centre. In 1859, architects John Prichard and John Pollard Seddon (working as Prichard & Seddon) came up with a design with a wide nave and a crossing steeple. John Newman describes the resulting church, dedicated to Saint Andrew, as a \\"rather unimpressive building\\". It was completed and consecrated in 1863 but had been reduced in ambition and cost. Alexander Roos, the Bute architect, had taken over in 1862. Transepts and vestries by William Butterfield, as well as porches on either side, were added in 1884‚Äì1886. In 1856 the Marchioness of Bute also built a Welsh-language church in Tyndall Street, close to the new Cardiff Docks, but because of the changing demographics by 1870 the church was providing services exclusively in English. Though other churches provided some Welsh services, in 1889 a new Welsh-language church hall, Capel Dewi Sant, was constructed at Howard Gardens to the east of the town centre. A new church, Eglwys Dewi Sant, was opened next door in 1891. The church provided services to the Welsh-speaking community for 50 years, until it was severely damaged in the Cardiff Blitz. By 1954, St Andrew's Church in St Andrew's Crescent was suffering from a dwindling congregation as local houses were being converted into offices. It closed and its congregation moved to St Teilo's Church, Cathays. The congregation of Eglwys Dewi Sant took the opportunity to move to St Andrew's, which was reconsecrated as Eglwys Dewi Sant on 1 November 1956. Eglwys Dewi Sant church was designated in 1975 as a grade II listed building. The church received a ¬£100,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2009, to replace the failing roof. Services and events To mark the church's 60th anniversary, in June 2017 Eglwys Dewi Sant held a flower festival, with more than half (¬£3600) of the proceeds being donated to Marie Curie Cancer Care.

Keeling, was a British philosopher, formerly a reader at University College London (UCL). He is best known for his 1934 monograph Descartes, printed in a second edition in 1968, which for decades served as the standard English introduction to the philosophy of Descartes. Keeling is also known for his 1934 annotated edition of Philosophical Studies by J. M. E. McTaggart. Honoring his passion for ancient, especially Greek, philosophy the UCL Department of Philosophy administer an annual memorial lecture, biennial colloquium and a postgraduate scholarship in ancient philosophy in his name.  Biography  Stanley Keeling was born, the younger of two sons to an ironmonger, in Islington on 9 August 1894. He completed his childhood studies at Southend Secondary School, Essex, in (or around) 1911. On leaving school, Keeling worked for an estate agent. He also turned his hand to what he termed 'mere journalism' which eventually led to his entering into the employ of psychologist and journal editor Charles S. Myers. Later friend Edward Senior reports that he could get \\"but the barest hint\\" of Keeling's academic work between his leaving school and the start of his university career in 1919, but suggests \\"it is fair to assume\\" that his education during that time, \\"with its leaning toward philosophy, was entirely self-directed.\\" Bertrand Russell (1916) As a conscientious objector to World War I, Keeling refused to submit to conscription as demanded by the Military Service Act 1916. He was thus arrested and convicted in court martial in January 1917. Senior reports that archival records from witnesses of The Society of Friends (of which Keeling was not himself a member) show him to have been incarcerated at Wormwood Scrubs on 2 February 1917 and, by 29 August of that year, at Dartmoor Prison. The latter, from the end of 1916. operated as Princetown Work Centre, a Home Office work camp for conscientious objectors. Internees were expected to work within the Centre, some sewing mailbags or, more commonly, on the moors, crushing grain or stone-breaking and carting granite at a quarry but enjoyed comparative comfort and relative liberty in return. Keeling, however, as \\"an absolutist i.e. one who refused any co-operation at all with the war effort\\" endured, as Senior recounts, \\"the harshest Military imprisonment\\" and resulting frail health. Thus Keeling came to the attention of the No- Conscription League (NCF) and its prestigious supporter Bertrand Russell who, Senior asserts, \\"doubtless.. was to some degree effective in urging a few exceptional privileges\\" for him. Keeling's exact date of release is unknown but, Senior suggests, it would have been not long before 10 April 1919. In June 1919 Keeling enrolled at University College London but it was not until October 1920 that he took on an advised curriculum. This was under George Dawes Hicks who, in 1904, had become the first appointed Professor of Moral Philosophy at UCL (the Chair having previously gone unfilled). After his death, Keeling would describe Hicks as a teacher \\"wholly engrossed in philosophy\\" who \\"firmly believed that it, as no other subject, could impart to his students an influence and a training such as would render them habitually reflective about their existence and destiny\\". J. M. E. McTaggart (1917) Bertrand Russell, along with Alfred North Whitehead, convinced Keeling to continue his studies at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was admitted to the same in October 1922 as 'pensioner with exhibition' and, was awarded his BA there in 1924. The philosophy taught at Cambridge at the time was, however, largely a disappointment to him. The sole exception reportedly being J. M. E. McTaggart who Keeling \\"held in the highest esteem as the only original metaphysician\\" of the century. Richard Wollheim. a later colleague at UCL from 1949, described Keeling as \\"a disciple of McTaggart who thought him right \\"on nearly all topics\\" apart from \\"one which left.. a bitter taste\\" ‚Äì whilst Keeling was a pacifist, \\"McTaggart was rabidly militaristic.\\" On completion of his BA Keeling was awarded (with Russell's support in solicitation) the John Stuart Mill Scholarship in Philosophy of Mind and Logic. which is administered by UCL. This was renewed for a second year and allowed Keeling to spend the two years following graduation studying abroad in, as he chose, France. He first attended the University of Toulouse where he was awarded a certificat d'√©tudes sup√©rieures, then the University of Montpellier, where, in 1925, he presented his thesis La nature de l'exp√©rience chez Kant et chez Bradley and was awarded his Docteur √®s lettres (D. √®s L.). Keeling was also to be honored in France as an officier d' Acad√©mie. The scholar's obituary in The Times noted that although philosophy was his \\"consuming passion from early adolescence\\" Keeling \\"found a second love in the wine and food and conversation of France\\". And that during his working life \\"he returned whenever possible to France, to Provence or to his splendid apartment in... Paris\\". (Indeed Richard Wollheim described Keeling as having lived in Paris and come over weekly to deliver his lectures.) In December 1925, Keeling received a testimonial letter from Russell ‚Äì who described his knowledge as \\"remarkable for so a young man\\" and his D. √®s L thesis as \\"a most scholarly piece of work\\" ‚Äì to use in support for applications for lectureship positions. Declining a fellowship at Harvard University, in 1927 Keeling took up a position as a philosophy lecturer at UCL (which had awarded him a degree of Master of Arts with \\"mark of distinction\\" the previous year). There he was successively appointed as senior lecturer and then reader. University College London would also award Keeling a Doctor of Letters degree. As was noted in his obituary, Keeling's combination of the Docteur √®s Lettres and Doctor Litterarum was an \\"unusual distinction\\". The latter was awarded in 1939 ‚Äì at the end of the decade during which Keeling had published his most famous scholarly works ‚Äì and shortly before the outbreak of World War II (during part of which Keeling acted as Head of Department). Wollheim recalls that A. J. Ayer (who was at UCL as Grote Professor from 1944 until 1959) liked Keeling, and particularly. talking to him in French but that \\"the feeling was not reciprocated\\". On the announcement of Keeling's decision to retire, Ayer paid for an expensive dinner in his honor but that Keeling \\"without waiting for Freddie's panegyric, announced to us all that he had been chased out of philosophy by some new wave, of which 'you' he said pointing at Freddie, 'are a major agent‚Äîno', he went on, 'I flatter you, you could never be more than a minor agent'\\". Ayer, Wollhein reports, was amused: \\"'What a rogue' he used to say afterwards‚Äî'rogue' being quite a term of endearment which he applied to most of his older philosophical colleagues in the other London colleges\\". The Times obituary report's that Keeling's \\"thirst for depth and precision\\" could be satisfied \\"only precariously among his philosophical colleagues at London\\". But that he had found \\"some relief\\" whilst employed at UCL through the conversations he had had with √âmile Meyerson, L√©on Robin, and √âtienne Gilson during his frequent returns to France. (The latter of which he had described in Descartes as a \\"prince among Cartesian scholars\\".) Keeling retired in 1954 to Paris with his wife and died there on 28 November 1979.
