It serves as a remote campus for the University of Glasgow, the University of the West of Scotland, Dumfries and Galloway College, and the Open University. The site also includes a hotel and conference centre, and Crichton Memorial Church, set in a park. The campus was established in the 19th century as the Crichton Royal Hospital, a psychiatric hospital. History The last, and grandest, of Scotland's royal asylums was founded in Dumfries in 1838 by Elizabeth Crichton of Friars Carse (1779–1862), a wealthy local widow. Elizabeth Crichton's initial intention had been to found a university in Dumfries but she was blocked from doing so by the existing Scottish universities. The original hospital building, now Crichton Hall, was designed by William Burn and opened as the Crichton Institution for Lunatics in 1839. It became the Crichton Royal Institution in 1840. The Southern Counties Asylum, which was intended to provide facilities for paupers, was erected on the site in 1849 and subsequently amalgamated with the main facility. Elizabeth Crichton persuaded the phrenologist William A. F. Browne (1805-1885) to become medical superintendent and to implement his innovative ideas of occupational therapy and art therapy. Browne remained at the Crichton for almost twenty years (1838-1857) and made a decisive contribution to asylum psychiatry, setting benchmark standards in therapeutic administration. He also hoarded a vast collection of patient art. The Crichton became widely known in the twentieth century for psychiatric research under the leadership of German Jewish émigrés, including Dr Willi Mayer-Gross.Park, Maureen (2010) Art in Madness: Dr W.A.F. Browne's Collection of Patient Art at Crichton Royal Institution, Dumfries Dumfries: Dumfries and Galloway Health Board Psychotherapist Ursula Fleming was educated at the hospital and Kate Fraser an early Scottish woman psychiatrist was a junior resident at the hospital. Among the people to have been treated there are artist Charles Altamont Doyle (father of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle), William James Blacklock, Lydia Miller (widow of Hugh Miller), and feminist writer Dora Marsden. An unidentified female patient of Dr James Gilchrist featured as an illustration (Figure 19) in Charles Darwin's The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). The hospital was expanded in the late 19th century, when Sydney Mitchell & Wilson added various buildings including the Crichton Memorial Church which is a category A listed building. Further villas were constructed between 1910 and 1914 by Mitchell's assistant Ernest Auldo Jamieson, and yet further between 1923 and 1936. The hospital became the Crichton Royal Hospital in 1945 and it joined the National Health Service in 1948. In 1995 the Crichton Development Company was established to regenerate the redundant hospital buildings. The redevelopment saw several of the hospital buildings converted for business park use, while the central area was maintained as a public park. A golf course was developed to the west of the site, and a hotel and conference centre were opened. Prince Charles visited the site and unveiled a statue of Elizabeth Crichton in May 2000. The Crichton Development Company acquired a 125-year lease on the site in 2004 and Dumfries and Galloway College moved to a brand new purpose-built £40 million building within the grounds in 2008. The last of the mental health wards finally closed, concluding the site's use as a hospital, in 2013. Courses The courses on offer at the Crichton University Campus include business, computing, teacher training and nursing courses. The Crichton Carbon Centre, housed in the Rutherford/McCowan building, is one of only two places where the Carbon Management postgraduate degree is available in Scotland. The University of Glasgow offers an MA in Health and Social Policy, an MA Primary Education Programme with Teaching Qualification and a BSc in Environmental Science and Sustainability on the campus.

The title was created by British developer Glen Pawley and released for Microsoft Windows on October 12, 2006. Distributed via direct download, a free trial version can be played for one hour, or the full version can be purchased online. Gameplay Intending to appeal to those who enjoy role- playing games but cannot devote the large number of hours typically required to complete them, FastCrawl aims to provide a complete game experience in around 30 minutes. Players can also opt for slightly longer games, and can play more slowly at their leisure, since the title is entirely turn-based. Dungeon layouts and virtually every other aspect of the game are randomly generated (cf. Rogue). When the game begins, players are given a brief mission statement instructing them to lead their party into the depths of the dungeon in order to find and exterminate a certain foe. Players begin with a randomly generated party, complete with names, character portraits, and starting equipment. Parties range from three to five individuals, and consist of a random selection of clerics, mages, rogues, and warriors. While players are guaranteed to not receive more than two of any given character class, there are no guarantees that the party will be balanced. While exploring the dungeon, players are provided with a simple iconic map representing the party's location and the location of nearby items of interest, including doors, rooms, hallways, enemies, and treasure. Players move from one location to another by clicking with the mouse (and in fact, the game is played entirely with the mouse). Each action consumes a single unit of supplies (representing food and water) which can only be replenished by discovering new supply packs in treasure troves. Resting also consumes a number of supplies, and running out of supplies is fatal, so players must only rest when absolutely necessary. When entering a location inhabited by monsters or other enemies, combat is initiated. At the start of each battle, players position their characters in either the front or rear rows, depending on equipment and function. The title uses an initiative system, allowing each character or enemy to act in order relative to their speed. Characters are limited to two actions, performed with either the left or right mouse button on the highlighted target. Hence, a cleric would ordinarily be able to attack a foe by clicking it with the left mouse button, or heal a fellow party member by right-clicking his or her portrait. While winning battles doesn't earn any experience, players can receive items for emerging victorious. After the goals of a given level are satisfied (which always includes locating the staircase leading down, and may include other objectives), players venture deeper into the dungeon. When going down a level, all characters in the party automatically go up in level and each may choose an enhancement or specialization. Additionally, any characters who were dead are restored to life. Players can not return to previous levels, and the difficulty of foes increases with each level. On the final level (usually the third or fourth), the game can be successfully completed by defeating the final villain or \\"boss\\" enemy. Scoring Since FastCrawl is designed to be replayed over and over again, the game features a relatively elaborate scoring system so that players can compare each game to previous efforts. Separate scoreboards are used for short, medium, and long duration games, but all difficulty levels share the same scoreboard. As successfully completing the game at a higher difficulty level almost always yields a higher score, players are encouraged to defeat the game on the harder difficulty levels (although successfully doing this can rely heavily on luck). Factors involved in score calculation include: * Difficulty level and number of dungeon levels traversed. * Percentage of completion, in terms of monsters slain, secrets found, and rooms explored. * A bonus awarded for playing with an \\"unbalanced\\" party. Reception The reviewer at \\"Game Tunnel\\" enjoyed the premise of the game, allowing one to play simple short adventures (with limited depth) in measured doses. He felt the replayability was quite high, commenting \\"I’ve yet to tire of FastCrawl and have been playing at least one adventure for each day of the week.\\" However, the review also noted that, due to the title's inherent randomness, a certain measure of frustration is sometimes unavoidable, remarking \\"It’s also entirely possible to spend an hour playing through an adventure and get to the last encounter and find its [sic] something your party simply cannot win.\\" Overall, the game earned a middle-of-the-road \\"try\\" recommendation. A review at \\"Just RPG\\" noted that the game wasn't \\"hardcore\\" enough for some, but that its strengths were also its weaknesses, concluding \\"If you're looking for a casual RPG to spend some time with, then look no further.\\" This casual appeal, along with the title's replayability, earned it a final grade of 76%.

Qmodem was widely used to access bulletin boards in the 1980s and was well respected in the Bulletin Board System community. Qmodem was also known as Qmodem SST and QmodemPro. History Qmodem was developed by John Friel III in 1984 and sold as shareware through a company called The Forbin Project. Qmodem gained in popularity very quickly because it was much faster and had many new features compared to PC-Talk, the dominant shareware IBM PC communications program of that time. Originally developed in Borland Turbo Pascal, the application originally supported the Xmodem protocol, gradually added support for other protocols such as the popular Zmodem protocol and CompuServe-specific protocols such as CIS-B and CIS-B+. Qmodem evolved to include features such as the ability to host a simple Bulletin Board System. The application was sold to Mustang Software in 1991 and in 1992 version 5 of the program was released. MSI product announcement =Qmodem Pro= It is a successor of Qmodem, by Mustang Software, Inc.

A FTS typically consists of mobile Vehicle Systems (VS) and a stationary Fleet Communication System (FCS). The FCS may be a stand alone application maintained by the motor carrier or an internet service running by the supplier of the system. The FCS usually includes a database in which all vehicle positions and messages are stored. Digital maps are often included which allow visualization of vehicle positions and traces. Communication with the FCS is realized by trunked radio, cellular, or satellite communication. Positioning of vehicles is usually realized by satellite positioning systems and/or dead reckoning using gyroscope and odometer. Usually, the VS is equipped with a simple input device allowing drivers to send predefined status messages. Drivers may add simple content, e.g., numeric values, but usually cannot enter arbitrary text. Besides the messages sent by drivers, some VS can also automatically submit messages, e.g., the vehicle’s position, data from sensors in the cargo body, or vehicle data from the CAN-bus and/or SAE J1939. In 2002, major European commercial vehicle manufacturers, namely Daimler Chrysler, MAN AG, Scania, DAF, IVECO, Volvo, and Renault, agreed to give third parties access to vehicle data using the CAN-bus as a connection. The Fleet Management Standard (FMS) is an open standard allowing, dependent on the vehicle equipment, access to vehicle data such as fuel consumption, engine data, or vehicle weight.

Hales was the eldest son of Thomas Hales of Howletts, Bekesbourne and his wife Mary Wood, daughter of Richard Wood of Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire. He was admitted at Inner Temple in 1683 and subsequently travelled abroad in France. His father died in 1692, and in December 1693, he inherited the baronetcy on the death of his grandfather Sir Robert Hales, who had been created a baronet at the Restoration. Hales was returned as a Tory Member of Parliament for Kent at the first general election of 1701. He topped the poll in a contest at the second general election of 1701 and was returned unopposed at the 1702 English general election. He did not stand in 1705. He stood for Nottinghamshire at a by-election in June 1711, but was unsuccessful. At the 1715 British general election Hales was returned as Whig MP for Canterbury and was then rewarded with an appointment to the commission for forfeited estates with a salary of £1,000 a year. He supported the Administration, except in 1719, when he voted against the Peerage Bill. He was re-elected for Canterbury in 1722 and 1727. Hales voted for the excise bill and at the 1734 British general election, he was defeated in the poll, but was returned on petition on 11 April 1735. He was defeated at the 1741 British general election and was not returned until a by-election on 23 January 1746. He was defeated at the 1747 general election and did not stand again.

This method so improved grass production that lands formerly needed to provide livestock with food during the winter could be given over to grazing or cereal production. It was one of the many new methods introduced during the British Agricultural Revolution that increased crop yields and allowed for the development of large cities. Early life Rowland Vaughan was the second son of Watkyn Vaughan of Bredwardine, Herefordshire. The Vaughan family was closely entwined with another local family, the Parrys, with numerous inter- marriages. It was through the contact of his great-aunt, Blanche Parry, that Rowland came to spend some time in the court of Queen Elizabeth I of England, Blanche being one of the queen's longest-serving women. However Rowland complained of the 'bitternesse' of Blanche's 'humor'. Rowland left court to join the military, leaving for the Nine Years' War in Ireland. Here the combination of bad food and wet weather invalided him from the Army, and he returned to Bredwardine. He recovered in six months and was planning to take to the field again, but met a 'country-gentlewoman' (another Parry) who had inherited a local manor, Newcourt, and married her. Rowland also inherited an adjoining estate, Whitehouse in Turnastone. The combined estates stretched along the Golden Valley, on the west bank of the River Dore, from Peterchurch to Bacton. Irrigation scheme After two years, \\"I began to expostulate with myself what was best to be done to preserve my reputation with my martiall companions, and with-all to give contentment to my vertuous and loving wife\\". His wife asked that he take to walking the estates, especially to check up on the miller who ran the water mill on her land. Millers were long considered the least honest workmen, and Rowland was less than impressed with the duty, complaining it \\"therefore requires the more paines to be taken in watching their water, & looking to their fingers.\\" Nevertheless he took her advice, \\"lest shee should have held me careless of her good, and so ill deserve her love.\\" It was during one of these walks that Rowland noticed a molehill that had been dug into a local stream such that water from the stream exited the bottom of the molehill. He noticed that the grass under the stream was considerably more lush than the grass around it. He set about attempting to duplicate the system on the Golden Valley properties. The work took twenty years, from about 1584 to 1604. The main component was a three-mile (5 km) long artificial channel leading from the Dore at Peterchurch, running alongside it, and finally back into the Dore at Abbey Dore.A corner of old England comes back to life – Telegraph The result was a large plot of land between the Dore and the trench that could be flooded. The \\"Trench Royal\\", as he called it, was wide and deep for the first half-mile, and then wide and deep for the rest. A sluicegate at the downstream exit controlled the flow of water into the fields; closing it would flood the fields, opening it allowed the water to drain off again. The use of flooding increased the yearly value of the land from £40 to £300 per year.Rowland Vaughan, Archenfield Archaeology Projects Six years later, in 1610 Rowland published a book describing the system, Most Approved and Long experienced Water Workes containing The manner of Winter and Summer drowning. In it he claimed that the Trench Royal was navigable, and was being used to ship goods from one end of the estate to the other. The book also claimed they built up the area, including a mill and up to 2,000 workers. If these accounts are true, no trace of their houses remains.The Post-Mediaeval Countryside An account was also published describing a similar system in the Wylye Valley in Wiltshire, but the name of the author is lost to history.Crop Nutrition in Tudor and Early Stuart England, G. E. Fussell It has more recently been shown that Vaughan's system was the duplicate of a system used throughout Europe as early as the 13th century, and it is now believed that his primarily role was to popularise the system in England, at least in hindsight. The Turnastone fields were purchased in January 2003 by the Countryside Restoration Trust to save the meadows from being turned into a potato farm. The fields have remained unploughed for four hundred years, and the sale of the land for farming would have destroyed this history. Although they are no longer filled with water, the irrigation system, including the Trench Royal, are still obvious features of the plot.Turnastone Court Farm References External links * People from Herefordshire 1559 births 1629 deaths ","title":"Rowland Vaughan"},{"id":"12857107","text":"Anthurium treleasei is a species of plant in the family Araceae.

Founded in 1986 by John Hackleman, The Pit fighters have competed in various promotions such as the UFC, WEC and DREAM. The Pit became world famous when Pit black belt Chuck Liddell became the UFC light-heavyweight champion. History In 1986, The Pit was founded in Woodland Hills, California as a training gym teaching the art of Kajukenbo, which is now known as Hawaiian Kempo. Founder, John Hackleman started the school as a means to teach a more straight forward, no- nonsense approach to martial arts. Initially, The Pit was intended for training serious fighters only and employed a logo depicting a Grim Reaper- like fighter. When The Pit opened to the general public, Hackleman renamed the school \\"KuZen\\" in order to attract kids and families. The Pit currently operates out of Arroyo Grande, California. It gained worldwide notoriety when Chuck Liddell became UFC Light-Heavyweight Champion. =The Pit boss= In 1985, Hackleman moved from Hawaii to California and renamed his martial arts style, Hawaiian Kempo. The Pit is the only Hawaiian Kempo school that uses the Ke-m-po spelling, instead of the more commonly used Ke-n-po. Hackleman describes his style as more hardcore than other Hawaiian Kenpo schools. He gave his school the style name \\"KuZen,\\" a word derived from mix \\"Ku,\\" the Hawaiian god of war, and \\"Zen,\\" for Zen Buddhism: this name was intended to attract children and families. Training style Hawaiian Kempo (a.k.a. Kajukenbo) blends kempo, karate, judo, jiu-jitsu, boxing and wrestling. The Pit places a heavy emphasis on \\"CrossPit\\": The Pit's specialty strength and conditioning fitness program developed in the vein of CrossFit. In order to add more time for a fitness-oriented curriculum aimed at producing well- conditioned athletes, training katas were eliminated from the original KaJuKenBo formula. Practicality and usability are emphasized in the areas of striking and grappling. Bag training is emphasized both standing and on the ground.

Guido Tarlati (died 1327) was a lord and Bishop of Arezzo. Tarlati was a member of the leading Ghibelline family of Arezzo, who were centered in their fief at Pietramala. In Arezzo, two aristocratic factions contended for domination, the Verdi and the Secchi, and when the latter gained control they had their leader, Guido Tarlati, Archpriest of the Pieve of S. Maria Aretina, elected bishop in 1312.G. Cappelletti, Le chiese d'Italia Vol. XVIII (Venezia: G. Antonelli 1864), p. 141. The electoral meeting following the death of Bishop Ildebrandino (1289–1312) chose to proceed by the \\"Way of compromise\\" and elected two persons, both Canons of the cathedral, to make the selection. They chose Guido, and the rest of the electoral meeting concurred and ratified the election. Guido immediately accepted, and procurators were chosen to carry the record of the election to the Papal Court at Avignon. Pope Clement V appointed a committee of three cardinals to look into the election and the character of the candidate, and when a favorable report was received, he issued a confirmation of the election of Bishop Guido on 7 July 1312.A copy of the letter survives in the Vatican Archives: Ubaldo Pasqui, Documenti per la storia della città di Arezzo nel medio evo Vol. II (Firenze 1916), pp. 524-525, no. 704. Pasqui's remarks are on pp. xviii–xix. He embarked on an activist program, building a wall around the city, and creating a new silver and copper currency.Black, p. 2. His program also included military conquest; on his funeral monument appear the names of: Lusignano, Chiusi, Fronzoli, Castel Focognano, Rondina, Bucine, Caprese, Lacerina, and Monte Sansovino. In 1321 he was declared seignior of Arezzo, a position he held until his death. During his administration he supported Uguccione della Faggiola and Castruccio Castracani, lords of Lucca, in their wars against Florence. Tarlati also expanded the territories of Arezzo, and in 1323, with the collaboration of Francesco I Ordelaffi (Ghibelline lord of Forlì), he conquered Città di Castello. Arezzo's expansion caused however the deterioration of the relations with the Papal States, ending with the excommunication of Tarlati by Pope John XXII. On 19 June 1325, Pope John XXII raised the commune of Cortona in the diocese of Arezzo to episcopal rank, as a reward for the fidelity of its Guelph populace. The diocese of Arezzo was greatly diminished in size. and Bishop Guido's spiritual powers terminated. Bullarum diplomatum IV, p. 313 column 1: \\"universitas Cortonae, quae hactenus de Aretina dioecesi existebat, sinistrae parlis non declinat in devium, nec suam ponit cum indevotis eiusdem Ecclesiae portionem, sed prono et prompto animo in eiusdem Ecclesiae obsequium totaliter se exponit.\\" The papal bull refers to the once Bishop Guido, indicating that he had already been deposed. A month later, on 20 July 1325, Guido Tarlati de Petramala was excommunicated. Bishop Guido was replaced by an Apostolic Administrator, Boso Ubertini, the Provost of Arezzo. Boso was named Bishop of Arezzo on 5 December 1326. But Tarlati hindered Boso from carrying out his functions. The coronation of Emperor Louis IV by Bishop Tarlati Tarlati's prestige as the leader in Tuscany of the Ghibelline party, however, was so high that German emperor Louis IV wanted to receive from him the Iron Crown. The coronation took place in Milan on 31 May 1327. A short time before his death Tarlati reconciled with the Pope. According to Giorgio Vasari the tomb commissioned by Guido's brother, the condottiero Pier Saccone Tarlati di Pietramala, was designed by Giotto (although this is disputed), who recommended to Pier Saccone the Sienese sculptors Agnolo da Ventura and Agostino di Giovanni to execute it.Noted by Joseph Archer Crowe and Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle (1903), A History of Painting in Italy, Umbria, Florence and Siena...

Lewis captained the Swansea schoolboys before skippering his country as a youth. Having signed apprenticeship forms at the Vetch Field, he captained the Welsh youth squad at the European Youth Championships in Germany in 1981. Lewis gained his one and only cap for Wales vs Brazil in 1983 where he exchanged shirts with Sócrates. Football Career A Welsh schoolboy international, Lewis began his career as an apprentice at his home town club Swansea City, making his professional debut in a 2–1 defeat to Notts County. After establishing himself in the side, Lewis helped the club to three Welsh Cup victories and promotion to First Division football. Lewis was involved in the famous game against Preston North End in 1981 that earned the Swans promotion to the top flight. When the Swans won promotion to the First Division in 1981 after that historic victory at Preston North End, manager John Toshack ran onto the pitch at the final whistle to hug one player. That player was Dudley Lewis. It was a show of appreciation from the manager to the youngster, who, in the final push for promotion, had displayed composure and maturity beyond his tender years. Lewis was a Pentrehafod schoolboy, who, even at that level was assured on the ball, captaining the Swansea schoolboys before skippering his country as a youth. Having signed apprenticeship forms at the Vetch Field, he captained the Welsh youth squad at the European Youth Championships in Germany in 1981. Lewis' star continued to rise, and he was handed his first-team debut for the Swans in February 1981 in an away fixture at Notts County before earning the first of his nine U21 Wales caps in a 2-1 victory over France at Somerton Park in October that year. But it was later on in the 1980-81 season that would define the composed defender's time with the Swans. With John Toshack's side slipping back in their chase for promotion to the top flight, Toshack chose to bring Dudley back into the team for the visit of Bolton Wanderers. And after an assured display in his role as sweeper, helping the Swans to a clean sheet and a 3-0 victory, Dudley kept his place in the side for the rest of the season. After winning promotion and his first Welsh Cup winners medal at the end of the historic 1980-81 campaign, he featured in Swansea's inaugural season in the top flight, playing in the final game of the season against European Cup winners Aston Villa. Recognition of Lewis' consistent displays came with his one and only full Welsh International cap against Brazil at Ninian Park in June 1983 - a game that saw Wales draw 1-1 with the South American giants. At the end of the game, Lewis swapped shirts with Brazilian legend Socrates.

The primary aim of the cultural hub is to encourage and facilitate cinematic awareness in society. It includes a few comparatively large screens housed in an impressively architectured building. The complex, besides being a modern cinema and cultural complex, is a popular destination for the young and the aged alike. Nandan is one of the main venues of the Kolkata International Film Festival, hosting it till 2010. While in 2011 the opening and closing ceremonies was shifted to Netaji Indoor Stadium, Nandan remains the main centre for the festival.  History  The foundation stone of Nandan was laid by former Chief Minister of West Bengal Jyoti Basu in 1980 and it was inaugurated by film-maker Satyajit Ray on 2 September, 1985. He designed the now-famous logo for the complex as well. Initially, Nandan had two auditoriums, a third auditorium was made soon after. In April 2011, the false ceiling of a Nandan auditorium crashed down. Right after the incident, the West Bengal government decided to refurbish Nandan, starting the renovation work with the construction of a new false ceiling for Nandan I. For the first phase of the renovation project, West Government gave to the Nandan authorities. The restoration works completed weeks before the 2011 Kolkata International Film Festival. The Nandan committee is headed by Bengali film director Sandip Ray. Few other members of the managing committee are Aparna Sen, Prabhat Roy, Ranjit Mallick etc. = Nandan and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee = Ex Chief Minister of West Bengal Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has a long relation with Nandan. In 1980 he laid the foundation stone of the theatre and for a long time Nandan was his favourite haunt. Ex Chief Minister of West Bengal Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has a long relation with Nandan. In 1980 he laid the foundation stone of the theatre. After losing the 1982 assembly election from Cossipore, he did not come to Nandan till 1987, when he changed constituency to Jadavpur and after winning the election. After becoming the Chief Minister of West Bengal in 2001, he started visiting the auditorium more frequently. Till 1995 he did not have own room here. Then he got a 300 sqft carpeted room on Nandan's second floor. Here he often used to meet personalities like Sunil Gangopadhyay, Soumitra Chatterjee etc. and proofread his writings on Manik Bandopadhyay or Jibanananda Das. After being defeated at the 2011 assembly elections of West Bengal by the Trinamool congress candidate Manish Gupta, Bhattacharjee stopped coming here. According to a report published in The Telegraph in July 2011, two months after West Bengal's assembly elections, Bhattacharjee almost stopped visiting his favourite evening spot. = Arrest of artists during 2007 Kolkata International Film Festival = On 11 November 2007 afternoon, actors, artists and writers of West Bengal were demonstrating at a protest in Cathedral Road against Nandigram violence in which at least 14 people died. At the same time, the Kolkata International Film Festival was going on in the theatres on Nandan. Kolkata Police and Rapid Action Force personnel were sent to the spot who arrested nearly 100 protesters including 20 women. The list of people who were arrested on the day included actor Parambrata Chatterjee, actress Bidipta Chakraborty etc. They were released after five hours after a meeting between deputy commissioner (headquarters) Vineet Goyel and a group of protesters led by director Aparna Sen, Gautam Ghose and Bengali poet Sankha Ghosh. Later, actor Parambrata Chatterjee told that he could not figure out the reason of the arrest— \\"I don’t know on what grounds we were arrested. We did not step into Nandan, nor did we have any arms and ammunition. We were sitting outside the Academy of Fine Arts, singing.\\"  Programs and festivals  Deceased poet Sunil Gangopadhyaya in Krittibash book stall in little magazine festival in Nandan Nandan has been a cultural hub of Kolkata for a long time. Memorial lectures and special programs are organised here on regular basis. Nandan also organises a Social Communication Film Festival in collaboration with Roopkala Kendra. = Kolkata International Film Festival = Kolkata International Film Festival started in 1995 and is India's third oldest film festival. Nandan is one of the main venues of this festival. Till 2010 the film festival used to be inaugurated at Nandan. In 2011, Mamata Banerjee, after becoming the Chief Minister of West Bengal, shifted the ceremony from Nandan to the Netaji Indoor Stadium. = Little Magazine Festival = A little magazine festival is organised by Paschimbanga Bangla Akademi in the Nandan premises every year. The festival commenced in 2001. Little magazine publishers from outside India (like Bangladesh) have also joined this festival.  Controversies  There have been complaints against Nandan that screening of controversial films are often shunned here on political pressure. In 2005 Nandan committee disallowed screening of Herbert commenting the film would send out wrong signals to audiences. One Day from a Hangman's Life directed by Joshy Joseph was banned here after getting instruction from the Chief Minister of West Bengal. Arekti Premer Golpo (2010), directed by Kaushik Ganguly, which dealt with homosexuality, was also barred at this theatre. Moinak Biswas, associate professor at Jadavpur University, whose film Sthaniyo Sangbad was disallowed in Nandan in 2010 commented— \\"Since all these films, including mine, had a censor certificate, it wasn’t Nandan's role to play super censor.\\" In May 2013, the theatre refused to screen the Bengali film Kagojer Nouka directed by Partha Sarathi Jowardar. The film revolved around a chit fund scam. Jowardar told to media that they sent the movie to Nandan authority for preview but he thought he did not even see the film before barring it.

Situated for the most part in Saharan lowlands of northeast Algeria, the Grand Erg Oriental covers an area some 600 km wide by 200 km north to south. The erg's northeastern edge spills over into neighbouring Tunisia. Natural phenomena The Grand Erg Oriental is a desert, a natural region receiving very little rainfall. It is the largest Erg in Algeria, the next in size being the much smaller Grand Erg Occidental ('Western Sand Sea'). The largest erg of the Sahara is probably As- Sahra al-Libiyah, which straddles the inland border of Libya and Egypt. Erg is a Tamachek Berber word,Erg is an Afroasiatic word similar to Amharic 'arǎgǎ: \\"rise, ascend\\". Said to be \\"Hamitic\\" in origin (as opposed to \\"Semitic\\"). Webster's Third New International Dictionary (Springfield: Merriam 1971) p.770. The Berber language is included in \\"Hamitic\\".In Arabic called 'Ramlat'. and also a geographic term of art. The Grand Erg Oriental used to be associated with the Wadi Igharghar, a mostly dry and buried river with a sizable network of tributaries which, should it possess any water, would flow north into the erg from the Ahaggar mountains of the central Sahara. Yet such dry, anciently-made river beds, lying seemingly useless beneath the desert sands, can preserve the infrequent rain water, by carrying it off underground and so rescue the moisture from an otherwise \\"intense and almost instantaneous\\" evaporation.E.-F.

The great desert (Columbia Univ. 1935; reprint 1970; reprint 1987) at 92 (map), 90 (Igharghar wadi dry), 97-98 (evaporation).Since, the Grand Erg Oriental's former southern area has come to be considered a separate erg, namely the Issaouane. Hence any water entering the Wadi Igharghar from Ahaggar would flow into the Issaouane Erg. Yet other underground wadis flow in and through the Grand Erg Oriental. The geographic concept remains, i.e., of the effect of buried river tributary systems under the sand dunes vis-a-vis the surface location of grazing grounds and wells.\\"Tassili n'Ajjer, 1974.

Accordingly, surface moisture, seasonal pastures, and wells may reflect unseen conditions beneath the sands. What appears as an entirely inhospitable erg can elsewhere, in stark contrast, offer the fruits of \\"some buried wadi\\".E.-F. Gautier, Sahara.

To the north of the erg, the Aurès mountains provide abundant runoff. These waters feed the artesian aquifer of the Jerid,The Jerid (Djerid) is a region of chott (salt lakes) in south-central Tunisia, at the longitude of the Isle of Jerba. The Jerid extends far to the west, into Algeria south of the Aurès mountains, and north of the Grand Erg Oriental. despite its surface covering of salt lakes. These geographic conditions lie adjacent to the Grand Erg Oriental. Here grow \\"the finest dates of all the Maghrib\\". In winter, winds blow from the northwest and the north. The Grand Erg Oriental \\"appears to have been pushed forward on the east and southeast slopes\\" toward Ghadames at the Libyan border.E.-F. Gautier, Sahara (Paris 1928; Columbia Univ. 1935; reprint 1987) at 91 (Auras and dates), 93 (NE wind and Ghadames). Satellite image of the Sahara desert. NASA World Wind. Grand Erg Oriental is by light yellow area at top center. Winds over time will sweep desert sand into heaps which, given enough sand, form into a series of hills. In some types of dunes the slope on the windward side is gradual, on the leeward steep, and such dunes may \\"roll\\" forward being blown in the direction of the wind is taking. These dunes tend to be perpendicular to the wind's direction. Vegetation does not survive in such spreads of hot dry sand. Only in rare areas where moisture can endure is there life. Common in the Sahara desert are seif dunes: here the air currents form sand dunes parallel to the prevailing direction of the wind. These dunes have long, sharp ridge lines. Cross-winds, however, may alter the height or width of such lengthy dunes, with the slope being steep on both sides. Seif dunes generally form long rows whose parallel ridge lines follow the wind's direction. There are other types of dunes, as well as \\"complex\\" dunes. Saharan winds are also known to clear an area of sand altogether, leaving bare rock (hamada) or gravel (reg).W. G. Moore, A Dictionary of Geography (Penguin 1949, 3d ed. 1963) at 64 (erg), 58-59 (dune), 82 (hamada [rock]), 146 (reg [gravel]), 157 (seif dune). Routes, cities, oil industry Major Saharan topography, showing the Grand Erg Oriental in yellow at top center, right. The Grand Erg Oriental is accessible overland by an Algerian road, which goes south from Constantine. It passes through the Aurès mountains, then salt lakes by the city of Biskra. Next the road skirts the western edge of the erg. After about 500 km. in all, it reaches the ancient oasis of Ourgla [Wargla]. Since late antiquity Wargla was a stop for the Saharan trade, being situated along a caravan route of several thousand kilometers, stretching from the Mediterranean to the Sahel. In the process such caravans crossed the great desert (Ar: aṣ-ṣaḥrā´ al-kubra). Wargla was the capital of late medieval M'zab, an Ibadi political entity descended from the earlier Rustamid polity.E. W. Bovill, The Golden Trade of the Moors (Oxford University 1958, 2d ed. 1968) at 83. The Sahel was about a \\"seventy days' march\\" south from Wargla, according to Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406). Bovill (1958, 1968) at 92.Cf., History of early Islamic Tunisia#Rustamid kingdom. Wargla is today a mid-sized modern city (pop: 129,000) and provincial capital, with a focus on the oil industry.Wargla. The above north-south Algerian road from Constantine passes through other oases. North of Wargla [Ourgla] lies Touggourt [Tuggurt, Taghit] (pop: 153,000), where date palms are grown commercially. Touggourt was formerly a medieval Sultanate and a northern oasis on a Trans-Saharan trade route.Tuggurt's participation in the Trans-Saharan trade: Christopher Fyfe, \\"West African Trade, 1000-1800\\" at 232-247, map at 232, in A Thousand Years of West African History (Ibadan University 1965), edited by J. F. Ade. Ajayi and Ian Espie.Tuggurt enjoyed \\"complete independence\\" during the 18th century and into the 19th. Charles-André Julien, History of North Africa (Paris 1931, 1961; London: Routledge and Kegan Paul 1970) at 325-326. South of Wargla on this road, lies Hassi Messaoud [\\"blessed well\\"], which is located within the Grand Erg. Until recently Hassi Messaoud was a small Saharan village, but has grown substantially on account of the local discovery of oil in 1956. An oil refinery has since been built, and the city (current population estimated at 60,000) is now served by an international airport.Hassi Messaoud. A desert road going east from Hassi Messaoud continues through the Grand Erg, passing by a well named Bordj Sif Fatima [\\"Fatima's River Tower\\" perhaps],Bordj Sif Fatima possibly means: \\"Tower\\" (Arabic: Bordj) + \\"River\\" (Berber: Sif) + \\"Fatima\\" (daughter of the prophet Muhammad); hence, \\"Tower River Fatima\\". on its way to the small but ancient settlement of Ghadames at the Libyan frontier. Another and better road from Hassi Messaoud goes south, also crossing the grand erg where it passes a well called Hassi Tartrat,Tartrat (tar-trate) is a salt or ester of tartaric acid. before reaching the erg's far side. Further south lies the Ahaggar mountains.Oxford Atlas of the World (Oxford University 2005) at 267. The cities of Wargla and Touggourt lie outside the western limits of the erg. Nearby, within the accepted boundaries of the Grand Erg Oriental, the landscape is described as being \\"practically free from [sand] dunes\\" evidently due to strong, persistent winds.E.-F. Gautier, Le Sahara (Paris: Payot, 2d ed. 1928), translated and augmented as Sahara. The great desert (Columbia University 1935; reprint: Octagon 1970; reprint: Hippocrene 1987) at 93. Petroleum and other hydrocarbons have been extracted in Algeria, from areas in and surrounding the Grand Erg Oriental. In addition to oil in Wargla and Hassi Messaoud (see above), other Algerian hydrocarbon sites include In Salah, a city (pop: 44,000) to the erg's southwest, yielding natural gas, and also El Adeb Larache, Edjelé, Tingentourine, and Zarzaïtine (south of the erg, close to Libya).Nearby Zarzaïtine lies In Aménas, from where originates the In Aménas-Hassi Messaoud gas pipeline. One of Algeria's largest field of natural gas is near Ghardaïa, west of Touggourt. Gas pipelines have been constructed north to the Mediterranean port of Bourgie, and later northeast through Tunisia.Richard M. Brace, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia (Prentice-Hall 1964) at ii (map), 163-165.In 2003 Algeria and Tunisia formed Numhyd, a petroleum company to develop resources. It is jointly owned (each 50%) by government corporations, Algeria's Sonatrach and Tunisia's Entreprise Tunisienne d'Activités Pétrolières (ETAP). Yet most of the oil lies within Algeria.Robert A. Mortimer, \\"Algeria\\" at 20-21, in The Oxford Companion to Politics in the World, ed. by Joel Krieger (Oxford Univ., 2d ed. 2001). Along the north rim of the Grand Erg Oriental, both the physical ecology and the human culture surviving there since ancient times are said to form a continuum. From Biskra (pop: 200,000) in Algeria by the Aurès mountains, this region extends east to the Djerid of Tunisia.Tozeur by Chott el Jerid. It is a low-lying area of chotts (salt pans), and occasional oases, where exists intensive cultivation of date palms in the tens of thousands.Julia A. Clancy-Smith, Rebel and Saint. Muslim notables, popular protest, colonial encounters (Algeria and Tunisia, 1800-1904), University of California Press 1994, at 13: \\"[T]he oases from Biskra to the Jarid formed not only a relatively uniform geographical entity but a unified economic and socio-cultural domain as well.\\"This low-lying area in Mesolithic times was the center of Capsian culture. Between Biskra and the Djerid, but a little to the south, lies El Oued, a mid-sized Algerian city (pop: 139,000), graced with domes and arches of Saharan architecture.El Oued cityscapeOued is a French transliteration of Arabic wadi [\\"seasonal river\\"]. Also an oasis, it's located about 100 km. east of Touggourt and by the northern frontier of the erg. The thirst of El Oued is quenched by a subterranean river.El Oued In Tunisia south of the sea port of Gabès, in the vicinity of the Grand Erg's northeast edge, there are a number of Berber villages, among them Tataouine.Parts of the Star Wars films were shot at Tataouine. From here a bleak Tunisian paved road leads south along the Libyan border, by sand dunes of the Grand Erg's eastern limits, terminating at Borj El Khadra, an oasis, near Ghadames.Fadia Elia Estefan, \\"The Economy\\", 145-204, at 200 (map), in Tunisia. A country study edited by Nelson (American University, 3d ed. 1986). House in Ghadames, modern Libya, near the southeast edge of the Erg. The ancient oasis town of Ghadames (pop: 7,000) in Libya is located by where the frontiers of Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya meet.Ghadames is also modernly transcripted as Ghudamis. The city is situated directly adjacent to the Grand Erg's southeast edge. Tuareg Berbers (a people sourced in the central Sahara) compose the majority in Ghadames. This oasis was known by ancient Egypt, and later by Carthage and by Rome, as Cydamus.E.-F. Gautier, Sahara. The great desert (Paris: 2d ed. 1928; Columbia Univ. 1935; reprint 1987) at 185.E. W.

Ouargla Airport (OGX) has limited international and national flights. North of the erg Guemar Airport, 20 km. from El Oued, has only national flights. In Libya Ghadames Airport schedules only national flights.

The root of the paradoxes lies in a mismatch between the interpretation of the validity of logical implication in natural language, and its formal interpretation in classical logic, dating back to George Boole's algebraic logic. In classical logic, implication describes conditional if-then statements using a truth-functional interpretation, i.e. \\"p implies q\\" is defined to be \\"it is not the case that p is true and q false\\". Also, \\"p implies q\\" is equivalent to \\"p is false or q is true\\". For example, \\"if it is raining, then I will bring an umbrella\\", is equivalent to \\"it is not raining, or I will bring an umbrella, or both\\". This truth-functional interpretation of implication is called material implication or material conditional. The paradoxes are logical statements which are true but whose truth is intuitively surprising to people who are not familiar with them. If the terms 'p', 'q' and 'r' stand for arbitrary propositions then the main paradoxes are given formally as follows: # These, which are all equivalent to (p lor eg p) lor q : ##( eg p land p) to q, p and its negation imply q. This is the paradox of entailment. ## eg p to (p to q) or p to (q lor p), if p is false then it implies every q, in which cases the statement p to q is said to be vacuously true; or if p is true then it implies itself or every q since p to p is equivalent to p lor eg p. This is referred to as 'explosion'. # p to (q to p) [ eg p lor ( eg q lor p)], if p is true then it is implied by every q. In other words, Begging the question is based on a paradox. By analogy with eg p to (p to q) being referred to as 'explosion', this could be referred to as 'implosion'. In these cases, the statement q to p is said to be vacuously true. # p to q,; p/ eg q;; vdash p to (q lor r) [p to ( eg q to r)] {((p to q) land p/ eg q) to (p to (q lor r) [p to ( eg q to r)])}, p implies q therefore it may alternatively imply any r which is not equivalent to q. Since r may be p or the negation of p or q, it is possible to infer a paradox from a straightforward implication. ## p to (q lor eg q) [ eg p lor (q lor eg q)], either q or its negation is true, so their disjunction is implied by every p; and its extension (p to [q lor r]) lor (q to r) [( eg p lor [q lor r]) lor ( eg q lor r)], if p, q and r are three arbitrary propositions, then either p implies either q or r or q implies r; or equivalently either q or its negation implies r. This is because if q is true then p implies it, and if it is false then q implies any other statement. Since r can be p, it follows that given two arbitrary propositions, one must imply the other, even if they are mutually contradictory, in other words the principle of totality for material implication is a paradox. For instance, \\"Nadia is in Barcelona implies Nadia is in Madrid, or Nadia is in Madrid implies Nadia is in Barcelona.\\" This truism sounds like nonsense in ordinary discourse. # eg(p to q) to (p land eg q) [( eg p lor q) lor (p land eg q)], if p does not imply q then p is true and q is false. NB if p were false then it would imply q, so p is true. If q were also true then p would imply q, hence q is false. This paradox is particularly surprising because it tells us that if one proposition does not imply another then the first is true and the second false. The paradoxes of material implication arise because of the truth-functional definition of material implication, which is said to be true merely because the antecedent is false or the consequent is true. By this criterion, \\"If the moon is made of green cheese, then the world is coming to an end,\\" is true merely because the moon is not made of green cheese. By extension, any contradiction implies anything whatsoever, since a contradiction is never true. (All paraconsistent logics must, by definition, reject (1) as invalid.) Also, any tautology is implied by anything whatsoever, since a tautology is always true. To sum up, although it is deceptively similar to what we mean by \\"logically follows\\" in ordinary usage, material implication does not capture the meaning of \\"if... then\\". Paradox of entailment As the best known of the paradoxes, and most formally simple, the paradox of entailment makes the best introduction. In natural language, an instance of the paradox of entailment arises: :It is raining And :It is not raining Therefore :George Washington is made of rakes. This arises from the principle of explosion, a law of classical logic stating that inconsistent premises always make an argument valid; that is, inconsistent premises imply any conclusion at all. This seems paradoxical because although the above is a logically valid argument, it is not sound (not all of its premises are true). =Construction= Validity is defined in classical logic as follows: :An argument (consisting of premises and a conclusion) is valid if and only if there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true and the conclusion is false. For example a valid argument might run: :If it is raining, water exists (1st premise) :It is raining (2nd premise) :Water exists (Conclusion) In this example there is no possible situation in which the premises are true while the conclusion is false. Since there is no counterexample, the argument is valid. But one could construct an argument in which the premises are inconsistent. This would satisfy the test for a valid argument since there would be no possible situation in which all the premises are true and therefore no possible situation in which all the premises are true and the conclusion is false. For example an argument with inconsistent premises might run: :It is definitely raining (1st premise; true) :It is not raining (2nd premise; false) :George Washington is made of rakes (Conclusion) As there is no possible situation where both premises could be true, then there is certainly no possible situation in which the premises could be true while the conclusion was false. So the argument is valid whatever the conclusion is; inconsistent premises imply all conclusions. =Explanation= The strangeness of the paradox of entailment comes from the fact that the definition of validity in classical logic does not always agree with the use of the term in ordinary language. In everyday use validity suggests that the premises are consistent. In classical logic, the additional notion of soundness is introduced. A sound argument is a valid argument with all true premises. Hence a valid argument with an inconsistent set of premises can never be sound. A suggested improvement to the notion of logical validity to eliminate this paradox is relevant logic. Simplification The classical paradox formulae are closely tied to the formula, * (p land q) to p the principle of Simplification, which can be derived from the paradox formulae rather easily (e.g. from (1) by Importation). In addition, there are serious problems with trying to use material implication as representing the English \\"if ... then ...\\". For example, the following are valid inferences: # (p to q) land (r to s) vdash (p to s) lor (r to q) # (p land q) to r vdash (p to r) lor (q to r) but mapping these back to English sentences using \\"if\\" gives paradoxes. The first might be read \\"If John is in London then he is in England, and if he is in Paris then he is in France. Therefore, it is either true that (a) if John is in London then he is in France, or (b) that if he is in Paris then he is in England.\\" Using material implication, if John really is in London, then (since he is not in Paris) (b) is true; whereas if he is in Paris, then (a) is true. Since he cannot be in both places, the conclusion that at least one of (a) or (b) is true is valid. But this does not match how \\"if ... then ...\\" is used in natural language: the most likely scenario in which one would say \\"If John is in London then he is in England\\" is if one does not know where John is, but nonetheless knows that if he is in London, he is in England. Under this interpretation, both premises are true, but both clauses of the conclusion are false. The second example can be read \\"If both switch A and switch B are closed, then the light is on. Therefore, it is either true that if switch A is closed, the light is on, or that if switch B is closed, the light is on.\\" Here, the most likely natural-language interpretation of the \\"if ... then ...\\" statements would be \\"whenever switch A is closed, the light is on\\", and \\"whenever switch B is closed, the light is on\\". Again, under this interpretation both clauses of the conclusion may be false (for instance in a series circuit, with a light that only comes on when both switches are closed).

The game was also released for the Game Boy and Game Gear handhelds published by GameTek, developed by Eurocom. Gameplay Tesserae is played by flipping colored tiles over other tiles to remove them from the board. While flipping over tiles subtracts the color from the tile that was jumped, landing on a tile adds the colors, making it more difficult for that tile to be removed. Primary tiles of red, blue and yellow combine to produce secondary tiles of purple, green and orange. A gray tile is produced by combining all three primary tiles. Game play starts simple with only primary tiles on a rectangular board. More complex board shapes as well as introducing secondary tiles increases the difficulty. New releases In 2009, Aki's Playware acquired the rights to Tesserae and revived the game on the iPhone platform. In 2010, Aki's Playware released a more complete and accurate revival, Tesserae HD for the iPad. The program, however, is no longer in the iTunes store.

As a singer, she specialises in Lieder, mélodies and baroque music. As a conductor, she directed Orfeo 55, the chamber orchestra she founded. She has been the principal guest conductor of RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra since September 2017 and chief conductor of Kristiansand Symphony Orchestra since September 2018. Career Born in Suresnes, she first studied with her mother, soprano Christiane Stutzmann, then at Nancy Conservatoire and later at the École d'Art Lyrique of the Paris Opera, focusing on lied, under Hans Hotter's tutelage. She studied conducting with Jorma Panula. She is well known for her interpretations of French mélodies and German lieder. Stutzmann also plays piano, bassoon and is a chamber musician. Stutzmann debuted as a concert singer at the Salle Pleyel, Paris, 1985, in Bach's Magnificat. Her recital debut was the following year in Nantes. Some of her operatic performances have included: Radamisto, Orfeo ed Euridice and Giulio Cesare. She has sung at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, Royal Festival Hall / “BBC Proms”, Carnegie Hall, Musikverein, Mozarteum, the Concertgebouw, La Monnaie, the Suntory Hall in Tokyo, La Scala, the Opéra de Genève and the Berliner Philharmonie. Her repertoire includes major works of baroque, classical, romantic and 20th-century music. Stutzmann performs frequently for opera, concert, recital and recording, and teaches at Geneva University of Music. She began performing and recording with Swedish pianist in 1994. She took part in the project of Ton Koopman and the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra & Choir to record Bach's complete vocal works. In 2009 Stutzmann founded chamber orchestra Orfeo 55, with which she performed as both soloist and conductor. The orchestra's residence was Arsenal de Metz. Commencing September 2017, she became the Principal Guest Conductor of the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra in Dublin, Ireland, with a contract for three years. In 2018 she was appointed as chief conductor in Kristiansand Symphony Orchestra. On 24 April 2019 she announced the closure of Orfeo 55.

They are the type genus of the tribe Arhopalini. In the relatively wide circumscription used here, it contains over 200 species collectively known as oakblues. They occur from Japan throughout temperate to tropical Asia south and east of the Himalayas to Australia and the Solomon Islands of Melanesia. Like many of their relatives, their caterpillars are attended and protected by ants (myrmecophily). Sexual dichromatism is often prominent in adult oakblues.Brower (2008) The genus' delimitation versus Amblypodia and Flos has proven to be problematic; not all issues are resolved and the assignment of species to these genera must be considered somewhat provisional. Systematics As circumscribed here, this genus includes many formerly independent genera. Junior synonyms of Arhopala are: * Acesina Moore, 1884 * Aurea Evans, 1957 * Daranasa Moore, 1884 (lapsus) * Darasana Moore, 1884 * \\"Iois\\" Doherty, 1899 (nomen nudum) * Narathura Moore, 1879 * Nilasera Moore, 1881 * Panchala Moore, 1882 * Satadra Moore, 1884 The species have been provisionally sorted into groups of presumed closest relatives, but many species remain insufficiently studied even for such a preliminary assessment at present. For example, A. phryxus - the type species used by Jean Baptiste Boisduval when he described Arhopala in 1832 - was established at the same time as and specifically for this genus. It is considered to be a valid species of unclear affiliations, but it is suspected that Boisduval's taxon is a junior synonym of A. thamyras - the namesake of its species group - which had been described as Papilio thamyras by Carl Linnaeus already in 1764.Brower (2008), and see Savela (2008) for additional references Molecular phylogenetic studies have only sampled a fraction of the known diversity of oakblues, but as it seems at least some of the groups represent clades that could justifiably be treated as subgenera. It is also to be seen, however, if the genus is monophyletic in the loose sense as used here, or would need to be split up again. =Species= Species are listed alphabetically, while the groups are listed in the presumed phylogenetic sequence: Bright oakblue (Arhopala madytus: centaurus group) Anthelus bushblue (Arhopala anthelus: anthelus group) Male opal oakblue (Arhopala opalina: camdeo group) Female Tytler's rosy oakblue (Arhopala allata allata: oenea group) upperside (left) and underside Arhopala alitaeus mirabella (alitaeus group) Male de Niceville's oakblue (Arhopala agrata: agrata group) Male Sylhet oakblue (Arhopala silhetensis: cleander group) Female Arhopala horsfieldi (eumolphus group) Malayan oakblue (Arhopala ammon: ganesa group) centaurus group (subgenus Nilasera if valid) * Arhopala acron * Arhopala adherbal Grose-Smith, 1902 * Arhopala admete (Hewitson, 1863) * Arhopala aexone (Hewitson, [1863]) * Arhopala alkisthenes Fruhstorfer, 1914 * Arhopala amantes -

It first aired on ABC January 11, 1967 in its second season and repeated June 14, 1967. The first of a three-part story, it was dubbed a \\"Batman special\\", simultaneously celebrating the show's one-year anniversary and helping to open ABC's \\"second season.\\" It featured both Cesar Romero as The Joker and Burgess Meredith as The Penguin (dubbed as an \\"Extra Special Guest Villain\\"). Plot synopsis The Joker pays a visit to Commissioner James Gordon's office at Police HQ and swipes a rare art map. Alerted, Batman and Robin deduce that he is plotting to commit twelve crimes based loosely on astrological signs of the zodiac and that he committed the first Zodiac Crime already by stealing the rare art map, whose initials stand for the sign of the Ram (Aries). Meanwhile, back at his hideout Joker clues the recently arrived (rather, packaged and shipped) Penguin into his astrological plan. He then gives a false clue to Batman and Robin to the effect that \\"Taurus the Bull is next on my show\\", and \\"You'll be singing a song of woe!\\" Batman and Robin deduce that Joker was telling them a lot of bull, believing that Joker's true objective involves kidnapping a famous brother-and-sister singing duo named the Twins (Gemini), who sing a song of woe, and they rush to their aid. Unknown to them, the singing duet have already been replaced by Joker's aides, the Penguin is waiting in the wings to ensnare Batman and Robin. Arriving at the studio, Batman and Robin are led outside, where Penguin escapes on Joker's Boom Bug. The Dynamic Duo chase the bizarre truck, but lose The Penguin, who cleverly lifts himself off with the aid of his umbrella and an overhead wire. While Batman and Robin are led astray, The Joker and his shapely henchwoman, Venus, make off with the true twins: the famous twin diamonds. Returning to the Batcave, The Caped Crusader learns the location of The Joker's hideout by analyzing the long wig left behind by Venus at the studio when she masqueraded as one of the Twins. Arriving at the hideout, Batman and Robin find the place deserted save for Venus, who falls for Batman and agrees to help him and Robin snare The Joker. She leads the Dynamic Duo to the opera house, where Joker and Penguin, plan to commit two Zodiac Crimes: the kidnapping of Leo Crustash (Leo the Lion and Crustacean the Crab). A fight ensues, but Joker and his minions escape with Crustash, abandoning Penguin to the fate of the authorities. Figuring that The Joker is scheming to pilfer a masterpiece entitled \\"Virgin Bereaved\\" (Virgo the Virgin), Batman and Robin dash to the Gotham City Museum and find Joker with only his henchman Uranus - or so they think. The duo's odds quickly go from 2-on-2 to 7-on-2 as the artwork around them reveals themselves to be the other henchmen. After the fight is over, Joker orders the final statue, \\"Venus Unobserved\\", to put them under with a sleeping powder. Venus watches in horror and regret as Joker then has the Duo tied down to an altar beneath a giant meteorite, which is rigged to fall on them when its supporting cable is severed by a revolving piece of thermite attached to a planetary mobile surrounding the great rock.

Charlie Catchpole of the Daily Mirror said as the \\"beautiful rich but tragic\\" Olivia, Down was \\"out-Sue- Ellening Sue-Ellen\\" in terms of tragic events they both endure. He also opined that Olivia should not have worried so much about her flashbacks, because they looked unrealistic. Justine Elias of The New York Times said Down and Buxton showed signs of \\"becoming a classic matchup of battling soap opera vixens\\" in the respective roles of Olivia and Annie. Candace Havens of The Vindicator praised Sunset Beach for its casting of Down, Berhens and Noone and opined it was \\"one thing\\" producers got right. While Julia Shih of The Michigan Daily opined that \\"credit should go to Lesley-Anne Down whose portrayal of a woman torn by her emotions is excellent\\".

It is recognized by the European Union, the Council of Europe, and the European Free Trade Association as the only representative cross-sectoral trade union organization at the European level. Some countries, such as Germany, Austria, Belgium, Sweden, Finland, and the other Nordic countries, have strong, centralized unions, where every type of industry has a specific union, which are then gathered in large national union confederations. The largest union confederation in Europe is the German Confederation of Trade Unions. Usually there are at least two national union confederations, one for academically educated and one for branches with lower education level. The largest Swedish union confederation is the blue-collar Swedish Trade Union Confederation (Landsorganisationen, or LO). The LO has about 1.5 million members (including pensioners), which is a sixth of Sweden's population (Swedish blue-collar density in 2000 was 83% and in 2019 60%; the total density of blue-collar + white-collar employees in 2019 was 68%).Yearly averages.

Generally, several unions are represented inside large companies or administrations, normally with one from each of the main national confederation of unions and possibly independent unions. Union membership, however, tends to be concentrated in some specific areas, especially the public sector.

It is endemic to China. It is threatened by habitat loss. This medicinal plant is a source of fragrant wood, formed under a pathological condition, called Chen Xiang () or agarwood. Description Aquilaria sinensis is an evergreen tree, 6 to 20 m tall. The smooth bark is grayish to dark grey, and the wood is white to yellowish – so giving it another Chinese name “Pak Muk Heung” (White Wood Incense). Its branchlets are sparsely covered with hairs when young. Its leaves are alternate, leathery, obovate to elliptic, generally 5 to 11 cm long and 2 to 4 cm wide, with 15 to 20 pairs of inconspicuous and nearly parallel lateral veins which is a helpful diagnostic feature in the field. The apex of each leaf is short acuminate and the base is broadly cuneate, with entire and smooth margins. Its flowers are yellowish green, fragrant, in a terminal or axillary umbel. The fruit is a woody obovoid capsule with an outer covering of short grey hairs, 2.5 to 3 cm long, opening in two flat valves when ripen. When the fruit is open, a silky thread from the base of the fruit holds the single seed (or two) in the air. Traditional uses The tree produces agarwood, a valuable fragrant wood used for incense and medicine. Previously, the wood was used to make joss sticks and incense, but in Hong Kong this industry has died out. The balm (resin) produced and accumulated from the wood is used as a valuable Chinese medicine called “Chen Xiang” (沉香). According to Chinese medicinal literature, the resin can be extracted in large quantities by natural fungal infection or by external wounding (up to 5 cm into the bark). Sustainable harvesting of the resin of one tree can be induced by opening a wound 3 to 4 cm into the bark, and with the resin collected a few years later after accumulation. Or a small quantity of resin can be extracted from wood blocks by heating or burning, so that the resin liquefies and seeps from the wood blocks. Sections of trees trunks or branches that contain patches of fragrant, resinous wood enter into the trade under the name “agarwood”. The resin is probably produced by the plant as a reaction against fungal infection or external wounding. Resin impregnated fragrant wood is usually found in trees older than 20 years. Although not all trees are infected, with increasing harvest pressure, harvesters in some regions often fell trees indiscriminately in search of infected wood. Good quality “Chen Xiang”, derived mostly from a related species Aquilaria malaccensis, was formerly imported from the Asian tropics into China but the supply of such quality products is now depleted. The resin produced by Aquilaria sinensis has been used as a substitute to the former and thus also under threats. Aquilaria sinensis is a traditional medicine of the Yi people. The extract of the leaves has a laxative effect and the chemical constituent that causes it is genkwanin 5-O-beta-primeveroside. The extract has shown activity against pain and inflammation in mice.

William established the neighbouring Savernake Forest as a favourite royal hunting ground, and Marlborough Castle became a royal residence: Henry I spent Easter at Marlborough in 1110, which strongly suggests that it was inhabitable. In 1110, Henry I observed Easter at Marlborough. During the Anarchy John FitzGilbert the marshal held Marlborough Castle for Stephen out of the fealty he owed him.Robert B. Patterson, \\"Anarchy in England, 1135–54: The Theory of the Constitution\\", Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies 6.3 (Autumn 1974:189–200) p. 199. In 1147 the 14-year-old future king Henry II marched into Wiltshire and seized Marlborough. He then stayed at the castle in 1149 while in talks with David I, King of Scotland about a potential northern alliance to attack Stephen's forces in Yorkshire. Stone was later used to strengthen the castle, around 1175. In 1186 Richard I (Coeur de Lion) gave the castle to his younger brother John, who married Isabel of Gloucester at the castle on 29 August 1189. John would spend some time in Marlborough, where he established a Treasury to support the Royal Mints that had been established by William I and William II. From 1223 to 1224, Eleanor of Brittany, cousin of Henry III and with a better claim to the throne according to primogeniture, was briefly kept there as a state prisoner. Between 1227 and 1272, Henry III spent the enormous sum of £2,000 on its buildings, particularly the apartments and chambers, and the chapel of St Nicholas. After the death of Henry III, Marlborough lost favour as a royal residence. From 1273 to 1369 it was used only as a dower house: the castle, with the royal borough attached to it, was assigned in 1273 for life to Henry's widow, Queen Eleanor (d. 1291), during whose tenure Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel was born in the castle, 1 May 1285. In 1293 it passed to the eldest daughter of King Edward I and Eleanor of Provence, also named Eleanor, who married Henry III, Count of Bar. In 1294 one of Edward's household knights, Eustace of Hatch, the constable of the castle, was appointed to extend the value of the dowry associated with the lands of the castle to 15,000 livres tournois per year. The younger Eleanor died in 1298, aged 29. In 1299, Eustace Hatch was granted 90 oaks from nearby Savernake Forest for the renovation of the great hall and chamber: in the same year the castle was assigned to Edward I's second wife Queen Marguerite (d. here 14 February 1318); in 1318 to King Edward II's consort Queen Isabella, who was deprived of it in the period 1324–27; and in 1330 to Queen Philippa, on whose death in 1369 it reverted to the Crown. Marlborough Castle ceased to be used in 1370 and fell into disrepair, but remained Crown property. Edward VI then passed it to the Seymour family, his mother's relatives.Marlborough: brief history  Later use  A plate of the Marlborough Mound illustrated in a 1776 copy of Itinerarium Curiosum by English Antiquarian William Stukeley. The castle was in ruins by 1403.

The house declined into a coaching inn, the Castle Inn, where the Marlborough Club, whose members were Tory gentlemen from Marlborough and the surrounding area, was established in 1774. The club met at the inn until 1842; the house became the nucleus of Marlborough College, founded in 1843.

It guest-starred Cesar Romero as The Joker. Its ending cliffhanger was the first for the series that would not be resolved until the following week. Plot synopsis With Batman and Robin bound underneath a giant meteorite boulder, soon to drop upon them when released by a burning thermite fuse, Batman frees one of his hands, takes a Batarang from his utility belt, and tosses it at the burning thermite. Breaking off a piece, Batman frees himself, pulls out a Batknife and cuts Robin loose, and they escape with seconds to spare before the great stone drops. Joker, believing the duo are finished, continues his \\"Zodiac Crime\\" spree, snatching a statue of Justice (Libra), worth a fortune in Carrara marble, from outside Police HQ, just as Venus, incognito as a trenchcoat detective, plucks a jeweled scorpion (Scorpio). The Dynamic Duo arrive at Police HQ in time to chase down Joker, who disguises himself as a police officer and retreats in a stolen police car. He then leads the police and the Dynamic Duo on a merry chase all over Gotham City by broadcasting bogus instructions on the police citizen's band radio, until Batman foils this plan. Unable to catch him, the Duo set a trap for Joker and his crew at the home of Basil Bowman (Sagittarius). When Joker arrives and finds Batman and Robin, he grabs Venus and, with a knife at her throat, makes his escape using her as his shield. Finally realizing Joker isn't to be trusted, Venus defects to The Dynamic Duo's side. She leads the duo to the Platter-Porium record shop and there, following a fierce battle with Joker's thugs, they find Leo Crustash. Later, not only does Joker snatch two rare palaremus demnese fish (Pisces) that were on exhibit at the Gotham City Park Fountain, but one of his men kidnaps Venus as well, not long after the Dynamic Duo speed off in a hot pursuit. En route to their hideout at the warehouse, the Joker's henchmen start shooting at the bullet-proof Batmobile as the Dynamic Duo give chase, forcing them to take a detour. Back at his lair, the Joker catches Batman and Robin in a huge net and quickly takes them to a water-filled tank, where, along with Venus, they are in due course to become the main course for a giant clam. The Joker and his henchmen depart to commit their next crime, while the clam proceeds to swallow Robin. Cliffhanger Text :ARE OUR EYES DECEIVING US??

The Maletinazo, Valijagate, or suitcase scandal was a 2007 scandal involving Venezuela and Argentina, souring friendship between the countries. The scandal began when Guido Alejandro Antonini Wilson, a Venezuelan-US entrepreneur, arrived in Argentina on a private flight, hired by Argentine and Venezuelan state officials, carrying US$800,000 in cash which he failed to declare. Venezuela had enacted strict foreign currency controls in 2003. CADIVI, the commission established by the Venezuelan government to regulate currency, prohibits taking more than US$10,000 in cash out of the country without declaring the money. Individual Venezuelans could only take US$500 or €400 cash out of the country in a single trip and there was a yearly quota of US$2,500 on credit card expenditures; a special government permit is needed to take additional US dollars out of the country. The scandal escalated with suggestions that: Wilson was part of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's personal entourage; the money was meant to help finance, and thus influence, the Argentine presidential candidate Cristina Fernández de Kirchner; the money was meant to bribe Argentine officials in energy deals for Venezuelan natural gas; or, the suitcase was intended for money-laundering. No allegations were proven and the case was closed in 2015 due to the statute of limitations. The scandal gained further notoriety when María del Luján Telpuk, the Argentine airport police officer who discovered the unreported currency, posed naked a few months later in the Argentine and Venezuelan versions of Playboy magazine. The word Maletinazo comes from maletín (the Spanish word for suitcase or briefcase) and the suffix -azo which implies intensity or magnitude. The scandal is also known as Valijagate, Maletagate and Maletíngate (following the -gate construction and the Spanish word maleta or valija for suitcase or briefcase). Background Cristina Fernández de Kirchner with Hugo Chávez. President Hugo Chávez was planning to visit Argentina in August 2007 to refinance billions of United States dollars in Argentine debt through bond purchases and announce a natural gas deal. On 4 August 2007, Guido Alejandro Antonini Wilson, a Venezuelan-US entrepreneur of Chávez's entourage, arrived in Argentina on a private plane chartered from Royal Class by Argentine and Venezuelan state officials, carrying US$790,550 in cash. He did not declare the money upon arrival and the police seized the money. Other Venezuelan passengers on the plane included Ruth Behrens, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) representative in Uruguay; Nelly Cardozo, legal assessor of that company; Wilfredo Ávila, a protocol official; Daniel Uzcategui Specht, son of PDVSA vice-president Diego Uzcateguil, and Maria Isabel Specht, Technology and Engineering Manager of Citgo Petroleum Corporation in Houston, Texas. Others on that flight were Exequiel Espinosa, president of Enarsa, Claudio Uberti of OCCOVI (Argentina's Highway Commission), and Victoria Bereziuk, Uberti's secretary. Although officials originally called it a simple infraction and released Antonini Wilson, both Argentine and Venezuelan officials called for an investigation. Chávez arrived in Argentina on 6 August 2007, as part of a tour to sign oil deals with several South American countries. Antonini Wilson attended the signing ceremony between the presidents of Argentina and Venezuela that took place in the presidential palace, also known as the Casa Rosada.\\"Antonini Estuvo en la Casa de Gobierno\\" La Nación, 12 January 2008 On 8 August 2007, the Argentine senate demanded a report on the incident. An Argentine judge later ordered the arrest of Antonini Wilson and he faced charges for money laundering and contraband.Ortiz, Fiona. \\"Suitcase of cash sparks new scandal in Argentina\\". Reuters, 9 August 2007. Retrieved on 22 August 2007. As investigations began, Antonini Wilson fled to the United States and arrived in Miami. Investigation Initially, Argentine judge Marta Novatti took the case but she quickly resigned from the investigation. The Argentine government fired one of the state officials who was on the plane, the head of Road Deal Controls, Claudio Uberti. Argentine Minister of Planning, Julio de Vido, declared that Uberti was the \\"political responsible for that flight\\"; Uberti was fired. The Argentine minister of interior, Fernández, declared the Senate's attempts to ask for a report on an individual, even if it is a crime case. He said the demand was politically motivated (referring to upcoming elections in Argentina). Venezuela's PDVSA announced an internal investigation to determine why four of their officials were traveling with Antonini Wilson. On 13 August 2007, Federal judge Diego Zysman stepped aside from the case, becoming the second judge to renounce investigating the case. Judge Novatti was notified by the Judicial Chamber of Economic Cases on 14 August 2007, that she had to take back the case. The Bolivian government declared the plane carrying Antonini Wilson to Buenos Aires only flew over Bolivia and did not land there, after some suggestions by Venezuelan officials that the money might have come from Bolivia (it would have been illegal to take that amount of money from Venezuela under current currency control laws). According to documents from the Supreme Court of Justice of Venezuela from 8 December 2004, an associate of Antonini, sold police equipment through a Venezuelan company Ruibal & Duran to the governor of Cojedes state, Johny Yánez, who days before declared that he did not have anything to do with Antonini. Clarín newspaper said Antonini had accompanied Yánez on a visit to Uruguay in September 2006. Argentina sent an arrest warrant to Interpol for the arrest of Antonini; Interpol released a capture order for the offense of fraud. The investigation in Argentina generated doubt regarding the behavior of members of the Kirchner administration. The investigation is also trying to determine why Enarsa spent $90,000 for a charter flight, and why Antonini Wilson was allowed to leave Argentina outbound to Uruguay. = Antonini Wilson involvement = According to El Nuevo Herald and El Universal, Antonini Wilson owned a condo in Ocean Club, Key Biscayne, Florida; together with Wladimir Abad, he is registered as owner of a building located in Mashta Avenue, in Key Biscayne, valued at $US3.96 million. Wladimir Abad is the secretary of American Food Grain (AFG), a part of a Venezuelan holding called Proarepa, owned by Sarkis Arslanian Beyloune and Ricardo Fernández Barrueco. Proarepa was in charge of the food distribution during Venezuela's oil strike of 2002, when Chávez signed contracts for food distribution. According to the Venezuelan Government Press Office, Proarepa is a private company that has \\"joined this mission (Mission Mercal) to offer food and better price to the Venezuelan consumer\\". According to El Nuevo Herald, Antonini Wilson's name was linked to other companies in southern Florida, such as Venuz Supply Inc., Intertel Telecom and Techmilk Inc.; La Nación says that Antonini was among a group of businessmen who benefited economically during the administration of Hugo Chávez. In May 2007, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) confiscated a jet belonging to American Food Grain. The report, according to The Miami Herald, says Ricardo Fernández Barruecos had not respected federal norms to register the plane in the United States. Originally reported at and Beginning in late August 2007, Antonini Wilson cooperated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. While wearing a covert listening device Wilson was approached by two Venezuelan businessmen; Carlos Kauffmann and Franklin Durán, Moisés Maiónica a Venezuelan lawyer and José Canchica of Venezuela's spy agency, the National Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services (DISIP). The individuals were recorded attempting to coerce Antonini Wilson to not reveal details about the funding conspiracy. In November 2007, Antonini Wilson met with Maiónica, who was described as a member of Hugo Chávez's \\"team of fixers\\". Maiónica said in a recording that money buying Antonini Wilson's silence could not be wired into the United States by PDVSA, so DISIP direct Henry Rangel Silva was using a \\"secret fund\\" to send a cash payment. The lawyer also asked Antonini Wilson to sign for a $2 million receipt so Rangel Silva had proof that the cash was delivered and would not be accused of keeping the money for himself. Finally, Maiónica said that Chávez asked PDVSA director Rafael Ramírez to manage the hush money, but later decided on Rangel Silva. In December 2007, the St. Petersburg Times reported that, according to prosecutors, \\"Antonini was delivering the money to the election campaign of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez\\", with \\"Venezuelan and Argentine officials accusing Washington of fabricating a scandal to destabilize left-wing governments in the region.\\" The Wall Street Journal also reported that: \\"U.S. prosecutors in Miami announced the arrest of three Venezuelans and a Uruguayan who allegedly schemed to silence Mr. Antonini about the Venezuelan contribution to the Kirchner campaign. An indictment charges the men—and a fifth who is a fugitive—with operating as Venezuelan agents unlawfully, without having notified the U.S. attorney general. In a court hearing, a U.S. attorney said Mr. Antonini is now cooperating with the investigation and wore a wire to record subsequent encounters with the alleged Venezuelan agents, who offered him $2 million in hush money, while also threatening his family if he didn't keep quiet.\\" =Alleged involvement of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner= On 13 December 2007 the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested three Venezuelans and one Uruguayan, accusing them of being agents of the Venezuelan government who intended for Antonini to help cover up the scandal over the money that was intended for \\"a candidate\\" in the Argentine presidential elections of 2007. The Assistant U.S. Attorney in charge of the case, Thomas Mulvihill, said that one of the arrested individuals, Franklin Durán, had declared that the money was for the then-presidential candidate Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. The Ambassador of the United States to Argentina assured that the event had nothing to do with the Argentina-United States relations. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner responded to the investigation led by the United States by dubbing it \\"operación basura\\" (a \\"trashing operation\\"). Details of the case were explained by businessman Carlos Kauffmann and lawyer Moisés Maiónica, with both testifying against Durán and pleading guilty to conspiracy. The two testified that the $800,000 was sent from Venezuela through PDVSA to fund Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's campaign, with the plot being orchestrated by Venezuela's National Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services. Reaction On 18 August 2007, President Chávez declared he had nothing to hide. Also available from Reuters. Retrieved 30 July 2008. There was little coverage of the scandal in Venezuela and Henry Rangel Silva, who was named as being involved in the controversy, was promoted to chief of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela. The Venezuelan ambassador in Buenos Aires declared that Antonini Wilson had nothing to do with the Venezuelan embassy. Argentine President Néstor Kirchner declared his government had nothing to do with the affair, and that there was no coverup. Venezuela's Minister of Foreign Affairs declared during the third meeting of Petrocaribe, \\"why is there such a scandal? Every day things like this happen in all the countries of the world\\". He said the reason for the publicity was that \\"some powerful people in Washington are very nervous because we are progressing in giant steps towards the union of South American countries, of the Caribbean union. They are afraid and they tremble\\". The head of PDVSA, Ramírez, declared \\"the media is trying to put PDVSA in a bad light for events that are 'completely false'\\", referring to the recent denouncements of corruption at the state oil company. He said \\"we see how there is premeditated attempt to publicly lynch our institution and our workers for facts that have not been supported or proved\\". The second vice-president of Venezuela's parliament, Roberto Hernández, declared on 10 August 2007 that those PDVSA managers who accompanied Antonini Wilson should be fired. The crisis prompted the Argentine government to ask Chávez to fire the person responsible for PDVSA in Argentina. The PDVSA official's son had accompanied Antonini Wilson to the flight. Other high officials from the Venezuelan and Argentine governments were present. The Venezuelan Minister of Interior declared that if there were a crime in cooperation with public functionaries, \\"the State does not have to assume any responsibility because responsibility is individual\\". He said it is false the Argentine government was asking for the vice-president of PDVSA—Diego Uzcátegui, whose son was traveling with Guido Antonini—to be fired.

The type species describes a specimen found in Australia. The poorly researched species have been variously placed by authors, and revised again by studies of their distinct characteristics, consequently the falsistrelles may also be referred to as pipistrelles or false pipstrelles.  Taxonomy  Common names for the species include falsistrelle and false pipistrelle. The description of the genus was published in 1943 by Ellis Le Geyt Troughton. Some authorities maintain the earlier treatment of taxa as genus Pipistrellus, while other maintain this as a separate group. One revision of the genus Pipistrellus resurrected Troughton's genus to accommodate the south-eastern Australian Falsistrellus tasmaniensis and elevated the south-western Australian pupulation as a new species, Falsistrellus mackenziei. The type species of the genus is Vespertilio tasmaniensis, described by John Gould in 1858, thus the combinations as Pipistrellus tasmaniensis and F. tasmaniensis. The species outside of Australia have been supposed to be conspecific, and those endemic to the continent separated by a variety of taxonomic treatments. The limited morphological or morphometric analyses lent support to some arrangements, yet remained inconclusive in their implications to ranks of genus and species of associated taxa. The phylogenetic study of Falsistrellus petersi and Nyctalus plancyi in 2012, then later work on vespertilionid taxa of the region, had implications for the inclusion of Indomalayan species, the affinis group, in genus Falsistrellus and a phylogenetic reconstruction (2018) sees them assigned to genus Hypsugo.  Species  As workers began to outline the diversity of vespertilionids during twentieth century several taxa were allied as the affinis group (Tate, 1942. et al), currently named as Falsistrellus affinis, F. petersi and the inclusion or omission of species F. mordax. The Australian taxa were named for the type as a tasmaniensis group, which came to include the western population as F. mackenziei. The standard text Mammal Species of the World (Simmons, 2005. 3rd ed.) recognises five species, *genus Falsistrellus *Chocolate pipistrelle, Falsistrellus affinis *Pungent pipistrelle, Falsistrellus mordax *Peters's pipistrelle, Falsistrellus petersi *Eastern false pipistrelle or eastern falsistrelle, Falsistrellus tasmaniensis An Australian endemic, named for Tasmania and found elsewhere *Western false pipistrelle or western falsistrelle, Falsistrellus mackenziei.

It was written by Frederick Lonsdale and Benjamin Glazer. Plot After selling his house and belongings in East Africa, upper-class black sheep Willie Hale (Colman) returns home to England, where he buys a dog with most of his remaining money. Lord Leeland (Kerr), his wealthy father, is furious and insists to Susan and Arthur, his other adult offspring, that he will kick his wayward son out if he dares show his face, seeing as he has given Willie ten starts in life already. However, when Willie does show up, the old man gives him £100 spending money instead. After seeing his old girlfriend, theatre star Mary Crayle (Loy), Willie meets family friend and heiress Dorothy Hope (Young). He takes Dorothy and Susan to the Derby, where he and Dorothy have a wonderful time (and he wins a great deal of money betting on a 50-1 longshot). Dorothy then breaks her engagement to Grand Duke Paul (Cavanagh) because she finds bankrupt Willie far more charming. Willie is reluctant to get involved with her, but when her father insists he will disinherit her if she marries Willie, he promptly proposes to her. She accepts, on condition that he promise to never see Mary ever again. Willie is unable to break the news to Mary by letter or telephone call, so he waits for her outside the theatre. She insists he come home with her, where he is finally able to tell her about his engagement. However, Mr. Hope gets Dorothy to agree to break up with Willie if he breaks his promise. He then hires a detective agency to watch the young man. He has Dorothy call Mary on the telephone. When Willie answers, she is heartbroken. When Willie goes to try to explain himself, Dorothy pays him £5000 for the bitter \\"experience\\", assuming that he was merely after her inheritance. She is astonished when he walks off with the check, whistling. Willie has no intention of keeping the money. After he hears that Paul is actually destitute, he sends the full sum to the man under Dorothy's name. Paul gladly accepts it. Paul sends a note to Dorothy thanking her, delighting Dorothy and disillusioning her father. Dorothy and Willie make up before he sets sail for New Zealand to start a sheep farm. Much to Lord Leeland's delight, Dorothy's father offers to buy him a farm in England; if Willie fails this time, Dorothy's father will be footing the bill, not him.

It never faced major opposition during the conflict and was decommissioned following the surrender of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Named after Brigadier General George Dashiell Bayard, who was killed at the Battle of Fredericksburg, the site of the fort is in Boundary Park, located at the intersection of River Road and Western Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., and is maintained by the U.S. National Park Service. No trace of the fort remains, though a marker commemorating its existence has been erected by the Park Service.  Pre-war use  Prior to the outbreak of the Civil War, the District of Columbia was a predominantly rural area. Though the city of Washington is today synonymous with the District of Columbia, in 1861, Washington occupied only a portion of the District. The remaining portions of the District were considered part of Washington County, and it was in this region that most of the forts defending Washington, including Fort Bayard, were constructed. Washington County was characterized as \\"the rural part of the district ... occupied by farms of various sizes and the grand estates of the well-to-do.\\"Washington at Home: An Illustrated History of Neighborhoods in the National Capital, Kathryn Schneider Smith, Editor (Northridge, CA: Windsor Publications, Inc., produced in cooperation with the Columbia Historical Society, 1988), p. 76 The site of Fort Bayard itself was owned by Philip J. Buckey, a farmer who made his home in the Fourth Ward of Washington County. During the construction process, he valued the land at approximately $5,000, and continued to live in a farmhouse near the fort with his wife, four children, and two servants throughout the course of the war.National Archives and Records Administration, Archives I, Record Group 29, Records of the Bureau of the Census, Microcopy 653, Eighth Census of the United States, 1860.

Tenleytown, D.C., Country Village into City Neighborhood Washington, D.C. (Tennally Press, 1981), p. 168 Also nearby was the Shoemaker family, which owned substantial tracts of land in both the District and in Maryland. Three forts or portions of forts were built on their property: Fort Simmons, Fort Mansfield, and Battery Bailey. Despite the loss of much of their land, the Shoemaker family continued to operate a local general store and sold various sundry items to the garrison at Fort Bayard.National Archives and Records Administration, Archives I, Record Group 92, Records of the Office of the Quartermaster General; Entry 225, Consolidated Correspondence File, \\"Defenses of Washington, DC,\\" Box 484  Planning and construction  Following the secession of Virginia and that state joining the Confederacy, Federal troops marched from Washington into the Arlington region of northern Virginia. The move was intended to forestall any attempt by Virginia militia or Confederate States Army to seize the capital city of the United States. Over the next seven weeks, forts were constructed along the banks of the Potomac River and at the approaches to each of the three major bridges (Chain Bridge, Long Bridge, and Aqueduct Bridge) connecting Virginia to Washington and Georgetown.J.G. Barnard and W.F. Barry, \\"Report of the Engineer and Artillery Operations of the Army of the Potomac from Its Organization to the Close of the Peninsular Campaign,\\" (New York: D. Van Nostrand, 1863), pp. 9-10. While the Potomac River forts were being built, planning and surveying was ordered for an enormous new ring of forts to protect the city. Unlike the fortifications under construction, the new forts would defend the city in all directions, not just the most direct route through Arlington. In mid-July, this work was interrupted by the First Battle of Bull Run. As the Army of Northeastern Virginia marched south to Manassas, the soldiers previously assigned to construction duties marched instead to battle. In the days that followed the Union defeat at Bull Run, panicked efforts were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack.Margaret Leech, Reveille in Washington (New York: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1941), pp. 101-110. The makeshift trenches and earthworks that resulted were largely confined to Arlington and the direct approaches to Washington. On July 26, 1861, five days after the battle, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was named commander of the military district of Washington and the subsequently renamed Army of the Potomac. Upon arriving in Washington, McClellan was appalled by the condition of the city's defenses. \\"In no quarter were the dispositions for defense such as to offer a vigorous resistance to a respectable body of the enemy, either in the position and numbers of the troops or the number and character of the defensive works... not a single defensive work had been commenced on the Maryland side. There was nothing to prevent the enemy shelling the city from heights within easy range, which could be occupied by a hostile column almost without resistance.\\"U.S., War Department, The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, 70 Volumes (Washington, DC: The Government Printing Office, 1880-1901) I, Volume 5, p. 11. To remedy the situation, one of McClellan's first orders upon taking command was to greatly expand the defenses of Washington. At all points of the compass, forts and entrenchments would be constructed in sufficient strength to slow an attack and buy time for reinforcements to arrive and bolster the city's defenses. Brigadier General John G. Barnard, was named chief engineer of the Department of Washington, and would supervise the construction and maintenance of the forts before being named chief engineer of the armies in the field by Ulysses S. Grant in 1864.Official Records, Serial I, Chapter 36, Part 3 (serial 69), p. 600 The location of Fort Bayard northwest of Tenleytown and Fort Reno in the District of Columbia. The line bisecting the fort is the border between the District of Columbia and Maryland. Prior to the outbreak of war, the Great Falls Turnpike, also known as River Road, was an important traffic artery for trade entering the District of Columbia from western Maryland and beyond. It connected the village of Tenleytown with the city of Washington, and roughly paralleled the Potomac River before turning northward. Due to its strategic position along the river, which formed the border between the Confederate state of Virginia and the Union state of Maryland, it had great military value and was a likely route for an attacking army, as would be proved three years after the outbreak of war during the Battle of Fort Stevens.Frank E. Vandiver, Jubal's Raid: General Early's Civil War Attack on Washington in 1864 (New York, NY: McGraw- Hill Book Company, Inc., 1960) To prevent a Confederate force from advancing on Washington along the Potomac, several forts were constructed on hills near the river. To guard River Road, which was the most direct route into the city, U.S. Army engineers built a small, round fort at the point where River Road crossed into the district of Columbia. With a perimeter of only 123 yards and mounting only six guns, it was located forward of Fort Reno, the largest fort protecting the Tenleytown area.List of Washington, D.C. Forts Accessed September 6, 2007. Details of the actual construction process are scarce, though a letter from a member of the Ninth New York Heavy Artillery regiment to the Democratic Press newspaper indicates that the fort was at least partially built with labor from that regiment.Letter to the Editor, Democratic Press. New York State, March 11, 1864. Accessed September 6, 2007. In April 1863, the fort was named in honor of the recently deceased Brigadier General George Dashiell Bayard, who had been killed on December 13, 1862, at the Battle of Fredericksburg.Official Records, Serial I, Volume 25, Part 2. Chapter 37, p. 187. At the time of its dedication, the fort was roughly complete. Round in shape and surrounded by trenches and abati, the fort's guns faced north, overlooking River Road. A service road crossed the trenches in the southern half of the fort, connecting with River Road behind the fort. Rifle pits extended northeast to Fort Reno and southwest to Fort Simmons.National Park Service, Fort Bayard Park A small battery of guns, named Battery Bayard, was an outwork of the fort and covered a blind spot in the ravine to the northwest of the fort.  Wartime use  Brigadier General George Dashiell Bayard In accordance to a plan laid out in an October 1861 report by General John G. Barnard, \\"rear line\\" forts were to receive one man per yard of fort perimeter when fully garrisoned. Front-line forts were to receive two men per yard, when needed. However, most forts were not kept fully garrisoned at all times.Official Records, Series I, Volume 5 (Serial 14), p. 626 Due to its location north of the Potomac River, Fort Bayard was considered a rear-line fort. If the fort needed to be fully garrisoned due to an impending attack, the difference in the actual garrison and the plan would be made good from Washington's 25,000-man reserve force. As General Barnard would say in a December 24, 1862, report, \\"It is seldom necessary to keep these infantry supports attached to the works.\\"Official Records, Series I, Volume 21 (Serial 23), p. 904 However, this plan only applied to men manning the walls of the fort, not the artillerymen who would be serving the fort's guns. To man the guns of Fort Greble and those of Washington's other forts, Barnard designated three crews for each gun. These crews would be permanently located at the fort, unlike the men assigned to the walls of the fort.Official Records, Series I, Volume 5 (Serial 14), p. 628 This plan was affected by the needs of the war. As the fighting dragged on and casualties mounted, the various commanders of the Army of the Potomac repeatedly raided the Washington garrison for trained artillerymen and infantry replacements. By 1864, Washington had been stripped to a total less than half that of Barnard's 1861 recommendation.U.S. National Park Service. History of Fort Stevens. Paragraph 2. Accessed September 6, 2007. A May 1864 report by General Albion P. Howe, inspector of artillery for the Union Army, found Fort Bayard's garrison to consist of only a single company from the Seventh New York Heavy Artillery regiment. One hundred and thirty-seven men of various ranks manned two 12-pound field howitzers and four 20-pound Parrott rifles. In addition, Howe found the fort's single magazine to be \\"dry and in good order,\\" and the ammunition supply as \\"full and servicible.\\" As to the garrison of the fort, Howe was less complimentary. After examining the garrison company's drill in artillery and infantry tactics, he reported the artillery drill as \\"ordinary; needs improving,\\" the infantry drill as \\"very indifferent; needs much improving,\\" and discipline at the fort overall was \\"indifferent.\\"Official Records Series I, Volume 26, Part 2 (Serial 68), pp. 883-97 Artillerymen and infantry from New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York were stationed at the fort at various times during the war.Official Records, Serial I, Volum 37, Part 1.

Following General Howe's unfavorable review of the Seventh New York, the garrison was replaced by a company of men from the 163rd Ohio Infantry.Official Records, Serial I, Volume 37, Part 1. Chapter 49, p. 466. = Battle of Fort Stevens = During the course of the war, Fort Bayard came under attack only once. During the Battle of Fort Stevens in July 1864, Confederate general Jubal Early launched a 25,000-man raid into Maryland with the hope of drawing off some of General Ulysses S. Grant's troops, who were pressing hard against the Army of Northern Virginia in the Siege of Petersburg. The raid hoped to attack Washington, thereby distracting Grant and potentially allowing the Confederate forces time to rest and regroup. On the morning of July 11, Confederate cavalry and infantry under the command of Brigadier General John McCausland advanced towards Washington with the goal of capturing Fort Reno, which defended the village of Tenleytown. Though they drove back the skirmish line in front of Fort Bayard, the Confederate cavalry were met with a heavy barrage of cannon fire from Bayard and its supporting forts. Discouraged by the resistance, McCausland's brigade moved to join up with the rest of Early's force, which was grouping for an assault on Fort Stevens.Frank E. Vandiver, Jubal's Raid: General Early's Civil War Attack on Washington in 1864 (New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc., 1960), p. 150. Throughout the day, additional reinforcements arrived at the fort, but no further Confederate attack took place. During the remainder of the war, Fort Bayard did not fire a shot in anger.  Postwar use  After the surrender of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, the primary reason for manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Col. Barton S. Alexander, chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Owing to its position north of the Potomac River and to the small size of the fort, Fort Bayard fell into the third-class category, and was abandoned a few months after the end of the war.Official Records, (Serial 97) Series I, Volume XLVI, Part 3, p. 1130. = Fort Bayard Park = Fort Bayard Park The abandoned fort remained in a constantly deteriorating condition until 1919, when the Commissioners of the District of Columbia pushed Congress to pass a bill that would consolidate the sites of the aging forts into a \\"Fort Circle\\" system of parks that would ring the growing city of Washington. As envisioned by the Commissioners, the Fort Circle would be a green ring of parks outside the city, owned by the government, and connected by a \\"Fort Drive\\" road in order to allow Washington's citizens to easily escape the confines of the capital. However, the bill allowing for the purchase of the former forts, which had been turned back over to private ownership after the war, failed to pass both the House of Representatives and Senate.Journal of the House of Representatives of the United States ... 66th Congress, 1st Session (Washington, DC: The Government Printing Office, 1919), p. 594 Despite that failure, in 1925 a similar bill passed both the House and Senate, which allowed for the creation of the National Capital Parks Commission (NCPC) to oversee the construction of a Fort Circle of parks similar to that proposed in 1919.\\"Linking of Forts Embodied in Plan,\\" The Evening Star, December 4, 1925 The duty of purchasing land and constructing the fort parks changed hands several times throughout the 1920s and 1930s, eventually culminating with the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service taking control of the project in the 1940s.National Capital Park and Planning Commission.\\" In H.S.

By 1963, when President John F. Kennedy began pushing Congress to finally build the Fort Circle Drive,Martha Strayer, \\"JFK Settles Battle Over Ft. Drive,\\" Washington Daily News, May 28, 1963. many in Washington and the National Park Service were openly questioning whether the plan had outgrown its usefulness.National Capital Planning Commission, Fort Park System: A Re-evaluation Study of Fort Drive, Washington, D.C.

Tuemmler and Associates, College Park, Maryland (Washington, DC: National Capital Planning Commission, 1965), pp. 3-9 After all, by this time, Washington had grown past the ring of forts that had protected it a century earlier, and city surface roads already connected the parks, albeit not in as linear a route as envisioned.\\"Fort Sites Eyed for Future Use,\\" The Washington Post, Friday, October 2, 1964. The plan to link Fort Bayard Park with other fort parks via a grand drive was quietly dropped in the years that followed. Today, the park is bordered by Western Avenue, River Road, and Fessenden, 46th and 47th Streets, NW in Washington, D.C.

Early life Santos was born in Santa Cruz, Manila, Philippines, on July 13, 1905, to Fructoso L. Santos and Agatona J. Manapat, and was seventh among fourteen children. His secondary education was acquired in Manila North High school (now Arellano). He graduated at Mapúa Institute of Technology with a degree in Bachelor of Science in civil engineering in 1931. In the same year, he passed the board examination. He showed interest in the military when he graduated on the top of his ROTC class at the University of the Philippines as a cadet colonel and corps commander in 1929. He continued this interest after schooling. Military career =The hero of the pockets= General Santos' military career started when he was appointed probationary third lieutenant on June 8, 1936, after five years of civil engineering practice. He entered the Reserve Officer Service School (ROSS) at Camp Henry T. Allen in Baguio City, where he was made the battalion commander. He graduated at the top of his class, and twenty years after, he was honored as its Most Distinguished Alumnus. Then Captain Santos was the most decorated unit commander of the 1st Regular Division in the memorable Bataan campaign, even dubbed by commanding general, Brigadier General Fidel V. Segundo, as the \\"Hammer of the Division\\" when he brilliantly outmaneuvered and outsmarted the enemy during their attempt to pocket their area. In both attempts, his unit successfully broke through the Gogo-Cotar and Tuol Pockets, thus earning for himself the moniker \\"hero of the pockets\\". For his heroic feat in battle, he was promoted to major in the field. Two days after, he was decorated with the United States Army's Distinguished Service Cross for \\"extraordinary heroism in combat in Bataan\\" and the Silver Star for \\"gallantry in action\\". Later, the Philippine Government awarded him the equivalent Distinguished Conduct Star and Gold Cross for the same combat action. =During World War II= On January 25, 1942, a superior Japanese Army force launched an attack southward from a general line along Pilar-Bagac Road. The attack swept the outpost line in resistance, and penetrated the Main Line of Resistance (MLR) of the 1st Regular Division on the Gogo-Cotar River area, Bataan, creating a 500-yard gap through which the enemy rushed. For four days, hundreds of Japanese troops tried to break through lines. Santos was given the hazardous mission of closing the gaps and annihilating the enemy troops who had infiltrated the lines as the gap posed a serious threat to the positions and the security of the division. He led a counter-attack against the strong and numerically superior Japanese forces positioned between the MLR and the Regimental Reserve Line (RRL). The fighting began at dawn of January 29, 1942. With dogged determination, the defenders fought assiduously and without pause against all odds to restore the defensive sector assigned to the 1st Regular Division. Major Santos was ordered to surrender his unit to the Imperial Japanese Forces, which he reluctantly did on April 12, 1942. He became a prisoner of war and was one of the captives in the \\"Death March\\" to Camp O'Donnell at Capas, Tarlac. He was released from the concentration camp on August 10, 1942. During the Japanese occupation from December 1942 to January 1945, he joined the Filipino-American Irregular Troops (FAIT) under Col. Hugh I. Straughn as chief of the Intelligence Division of the North Section in Manila, with the rank of colonel. He fought with the American and Filipino soldiers in the liberation of Manila from February to March 1945. He returned to military control at the end of the liberation campaign that year and was assigned at Camp Murphy as camp inspector of the 2nd Camp Complement. Later, he held other positions, including executive officer and S-3 of the 1st Camp Complement; acting district commander at Camp Olivas, San Fernando, Pampanga; commanding officer of the 4th MP Battalion, Mandaluyong, Rizal, in April 1946; and executive officer of the Presidential Guard Battalion in Malacañan Palace, Manila. =Military career after the war= In July 1946, he was sent to the United States as a student officer at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, US, where he finished the regular Command and Staff course a year later on July 3, 1947. When Congressman Datu Mangelen and Senator Salipada Pendatun offered him the provincial governorship of Cotabato in 1951, through then Secretary of National Defense Ramon Magsaysay, he declined. It was a personal decision which was very difficult to make. At that time, the position was appointive, rather than elective. The province of Cotabato then was in turmoil. Violent clashes occurred, resulting in the death of many political followers of contending parties. But he contended that the problem was essentially political in nature, and that he had charted his course for a military career. His negative reply was honored. Santos knew what he wanted in his career and to him a diversion like that of the appointive offer would adversely affect his plan to attain the highest position in the military hierarchy. =Santos and the Huk= General Santos with his soldiers Subsequently, Colonel Santos was given command of the Panay Task Force, composed of the 15th Battalion Combat Team (BCT) with some elements of the 9th BCT and the PC commands of Iloilo, Capiz and Antique. Reporting to his new command on March 1, 1951, he once more showed his incontestable ability and grit in military tactics. As proof of this, he earned the distinction of having accounted for the fall of two of the highest-ranking dissidents at the height of the Huk campaign. This position gave him the opportunity to put his military prowess in full play. He made history when Guillermo Capadocia, erstwhile secretary general and one of the founders of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), was captured at Barrio Yubog in San Remigio, Antique. During the hectic campaign to capture Capadocia and destroy the leftist band in 1951 and 1952 on Panay Island, Colonel Santos made one crucial decision which ensured the success of the operations. He organized a civilian commando unit headed by Pedro Valentin, a mountain leader who knew the people and the terrain very well. Part of his command decision was the designation of the civilian commando unit as the attacking force, while elements of the 15th BCT served as the holding or covering forces. Had it been otherwise, the wily Capadocia would have had the government forces running around at circles as they were handicapped in the rough terrain. Capadocia's death was the consummation of Santos' bold plan. The incessant military operations aimed primarily at the capture, whether dead or alive, of dissident leaders resulted in the surrender of hundreds of their men. In addition, the capture of the rebels' arms, supplies and equipment as well as important documents which were of great value to the entire campaign for peace and order throughout the country was crucial in breaking up the backbone of the dissidents' depredations in Visayas and Mindanao. =A crucial campaign, a smart decision and sweet victory= In the crucial campaign to capture Huk leader Mariano P. Balgos and destroy his group in the Bicol region, Colonel Santos made a decision to pull out all army troops from the provinces of Sorsogon, Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur after an on-the-spot study and estimate of the situation in the field. Operations then concentrated in the Manito area where the Huk leader was reportedly holed up. It was a risky decision, as it left those other area at the mercy of Balgos and his marauders, headed by the murderous Commander \\"Tagle\\". But the weather proved to be an unexpected ally in Colonel Santos' operation. A strong typhoon that was raging at the time, and the possibility that Balgos could have slipped out due to the thinness of the cordon surrounding him was very evident. Balgos loved sardines. The sardine manufacturer cooperated in putting botulism in the sardines distributed in the stores surrounding his hideout. Under cover of the typhoon, a scout ranger team (Rafael Ileto's) positioned itself at the latrine area of his camp and caught him in their sights literally with his pants down. Refusing to surrender, he jumped with both pistols drawn. His death compensated for the great risk taken. It virtually broke the expansion phase of the HMB and CPP in the Bicol region. Colonel Santos' deep understanding and full knowledge of the nature of the dissident underground movement enabled him to effect the intelligent deployment of his troops as well as secure the cooperation and support of the civilian population and weakening the Huk organization. Six days after his second achievement, Colonel Santos was appointed ad interim brigadier general by President Ramon Magsaysay, a well- deserved appointment which was confirmed by the Commission of Appointments on May 4, 1955. His successful effort in the Huk campaigns spread abroad and inspired other military leaders in Southeast Asia who were locked in similar fierce battle aimed at stopping the spread of Communism in their own similar countries. As a result, he was awarded Philippine Legion of Honor (Degree of Commander) and later another Legion of Honor (Degree of Officer) from the United States Government. =Position in the SEATO= In 1956, he was assigned back at Camp Murphy as chief of the War Plans Division. Santos later was nominated and subsequently installed as the first chief of SEATO Military Planning Office with headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand on March 1, 1957. =Army Career Management Program= General Santos with President Diosdado Macapagal On August 1, 1960, he was designated commanding general of the Philippine Army. Upon assumption of position, Santos pursued a career management program for officers, reassigning them in accordance with their career profile. A stickler for professional excellence, he instituted rigid training for troops and required appropriate compulsory schooling of officers who were in need of it. Through his conscientious and indefatigable efforts, he efficiently carried out the broad policies and vital mission of the PA, particularly the build-up and training of the Citizen Army and the implementation of the socio-economic military program of the AFP. He was deeply concerned with the welfare of his men and endeavored to improve the living conditions of the enlisted personnel and their families, raising their morale and improving discipline in the command. To better prepare military personnel for civilian life, he pursued non-military projects that could provide opportunities to soldiers and reservists especially upon their retirement or separation from the service, in the form of practical lessons and training in livestock-raising. On the matters of promotion and assignment of officers and men under his command, Santos emphasized the merit system for the sake of morale and discipline. His firm, mature and unyielding decisions on administrative matters, which were tempered with and founded upon justice and human understanding, contributed to a large extent to the effective synchronization of the various PA staffs and efficient functioning of the entire command. After having served for more than two years as commanding general of the Philippine Army, he was appointed by President Diosdado Macapagal as chief of staff of the AFP on September 1, 1962, thus becoming the first military man from the ranks of the ROTC and \\"citizen army\\" to be named to the highest military post. With his ascendance to this top position, he also set precedent of being the first one-star general to be elevated directly to a three-star rank, that of lieutenant general. =Election to the Allied Officers Hall of Fame= The latest honor bestowed upon General Santos was his election into the Allied Officers Hall of Fame at the United States Army Command and General Staff at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, US. He received the Certificate of Honor from US Ambassador Henry A. Byroade in simple ceremonies held at the US Embassy, Roxas Boulevard, Manila, on April 14, 1973.

Its original telecast occurred on January 18, 1967 with a rerun June 21, 1967. It guest-starred Cesar Romero as Joker and Burgess Meredith as Penguin. Plot synopsis In the previous episode, Batman and Joker's former henchwoman Venus are chained in a water pit where a giant clam has (almost) already swallowed Robin. Using every ounce of his strength, Batman bursts free of his chains, rushes over to the clam and pries it open long enough to rescue Robin from the maw of the mollusk. Freeing Venus, the trio make their escape, while the Joker, needing more assistance with his remaining two Zodiac crimes, has his henchmen Uranus and Mars smuggle the Penguin out of prison in a prison laundry truck by way of \\"Operation: Laundry Bag\\". Serious dissension soon builds between the two. Using a mixture of his own insidious creation, \\"Jokerjelly\\" (concentrated strawberry gelatin which resembles strawberry jelly, but tastes like strawberry axle grease), Joker and crew go to the Gotham City Reservoir, where he infuses the entire Gotham City water supply (Aquarius), and then demands $10 million to ransom it back. Meanwhile, the Penguin, claiming he has reformed, tries to win over Venus (who's staying at Bruce Wayne's midtown apartment) into asking Batman to let her visit the Batcave, so she can remove Penguin's criminal record from the Batcomputer for him. Batman and Robin fly out to the Jokerjelly-infested Gotham City Reservoir by Batcopter and restore the water supply with the trusty aid of a \\"Special Exploding Batarang\\" and the \\"Portable Batlab\\". Returning to the city, Batman and Robin pay a visit to Venus, who, falling for Penguin's fib about going straight, she convinces Batman into taking her to the Batcave. What the Dynamic Duo doesn't realize: Joker and Penguin are hoping to make Batman the goat (Capricorn). Batman and Robin return to the Batcave with Venus (having doused her with Batgas, naturally), and after a small tour, they get a surprise when the Penguin, Joker, Mercury, Mars, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus pop right out of the Batmobile's trunk, ready to assassinate them, and convert the Batcave into the headquarters of Gotham City's criminals. But Batman stops them by activating his newly designed \\"Batspectrograph Criminal Analyzer\\", which recorded Joker and Penguin's bone structure, metabolism rate, molecular blood structure, retina patterns, and other invaluable scientific data (he knew they were hiding in the trunk all along, and so he brought them both to the Batcave in order to utilize the analyzer which only works at close range and is too large to move). Penguin tries to kill Batman and Robin with his umbrella gun, but the \\"Batprobe Negative Ion Attractor\\", which Batman strategically installed in the Batmobile's trunk, depleted its power source during the time they were inside. After a fierce fight, the whole gang is captured and ready to be delivered to prison. Furthermore, when the Joker and Penguin threaten to reveal the location of the Batcave, which obviously would betray the Batman and Robin's secret identities, Batman reminds them to their profound chagrin that they've seen only the cave's interior and not its exterior so they have no idea of its location. While the Joker and Penguin accuse each other for forgetting to look out of the trunk during the trip, Batman reveals to Robin and Venus that he locked the trunk hatch while they were inside so they never would have been able to open it in transit anyway. He then calms down the Penguin and Joker by putting them under whiff of Batgas. Later at Wayne Manor, Dick Grayson cringes as he learns from Alfred that the main course for dinner is clam chowder, but Bruce Wayne assures him it's his chance to get even.

Her husband was a grandson of her father's former enemy, Louis XIV of France. Known in France as Auguste de Bade, she died in childbirth. She is an ancestor of Louis Philippe I and of several members of royal families of Europe, such as the Spanish and Italian royal families, as well as the present Grand Duke of Luxemburg. Infancy Auguste was born in Aschaffenburg as the ninth child of the imperial army commander Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden, and of his wife Princess Sibylle of Saxe-Lauenburg, who was twenty years younger than her husband. After her father's death in 1707, her mother Sibylle became regent of the Margraviate for Auguste's brother, Louis George. Her mother was a great patron of the arts, making Baden-Baden a centre of architectural culture. Between the years of her mother's Regency (1707–1727) Sibylle ordered the construction of some four palaces in the state as well as two churches. Auguste saw the construction of the Schloss Favorite in Rastatt. Her aunt Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg was the Grand Duchess of Tuscany as wife of Gian Gastone de' Medici, her husbands own distant cousin. The Italian born Prince of Carignan was also a distant cousin and was a resident at the French. Auguste was the youngest of nine children and was the only daughter to survive over the age of seven. She had one older brother, Louis George (1702–1761) the future Margrave of Baden-Baden and a younger one, Augustus George who was Margrave of Baden-Baden from 1761-1771 succeeding his brother. Duchess of Orléans Coat of arms of Auguste of as Duchess As her mother was regent of Auguste's native Baden-Baden, it was her mother who tried to find a suitable candidate for her only daughter. Her mother proposed two candidates; Prince Alexander Ferdinand of Thurn and Taxis, son and heir of Anselm Franz of Thurn and Taxis, a wealthy German noble of the powerful Thurn und Taxis family and the Postmaster General of the Holy Roman Empire. The second was a French prince, Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans. Portrait identified as Auguste as Duchess of Orléans by an unknown artist (possibly Pierre Gobert) Her mother preferred the French match as it would strengthen ties with a powerful neighbour who prior to Auguste's birth, had ravaged Baden-Baden. Auguste however preferred the German match due to her roots. Auguste, however gave into her mother and agreed to the match with Louis d'Orléans and there was a proxy ceremony held at the Schloss Rastatt before she was married on 13 July 1724 Louis d'Orléans, the grandson of Louis XIV of France through his illegitimate daughter Françoise Marie de Bourbon. Chosen for, among other reasons, her family's Catholicism, she brought a comparatively small dowry of 80,000 livres to the Orléans. At the court of Versailles, she was known alternatively as Jeanne or Auguste de Bade, it was as the latter which she signed.Dufresne, Claude, Les Orléans, CRITERION, Paris, 1991, chapter: Un prince par trop dévot. Her marriage to the First Prince of the Blood allowed her to use the style of Madame la Princesse, and made her one of the most important ladies at the court of the young Louis XV of France. At the time of her marriage, the young king Louis was \\"engaged\\" to his first cousin the Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain. The couple were never actually married and in 1725 she was sent back to Spain then making Auguste and her mother in law the Dowager Duchess of Orléans the most senior women at court. She was popular with the court and noted as being very charming. In 1725, Louis XV married Marie Leszczyńska, making Auguste one step behind the new queen in terms of rank and etiquette. She and her husband lived in the Château de Saint-Cloud, one of the Orléans' residences, and had also an apartment at the château of Versailles where her son Louis Philippe was born in 1725. Expecting to give birth to her second child at Versailles in early August 1726, her mother in law Dowager Duchess of Orléans forced her heavily pregnant daughter in law to return to Paris in order to have the child at the Palais-Royal. Leaving Versailles on 4 August, she had to stop at Sèvres due to the extremity of her labour pains. Despite the stop, she returned to Paris. Auguste died on 8 August 1726, at the age of twenty-one, three days after giving birth to the couple's second child at the Palais-Royal, the Paris residence of the House of Orléans. Despite the shortness of the relationship, many contemporaries said that the couple was well matched and that they had fallen in love at first sight. After her death, her husband went into a long period of mourning. It was said of Auguste that she had all the great qualities of the heart, that she died with the universal regret of France. She was buried at the Val-de- Grâce Convent in Paris. After her death, her aunt-in-law Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléanssister of the Regent suggested that Louis marry one of her daughters, namely Élisabeth Thérèselater wife of Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia and Queen of Sardinia and Anne Charlotte. Louis refused outright, much to the annoyance of his aunt.

History Ambleteuse began as a hamlet of a few huts in the middle of the dunes, from which the derisory name of “carcahuttes\\" (huts made from old-boat hulls) was once given to its inhabitants by their neighbors at Audresselles. The reason for its existence relates to the temporary needs of various invaders for conquering people from either side of the English Channel. Ambleteuse is one of the candidates for the harbour that Julius Caesar used to set out from for his invasion of Britain in 54 BC, though Boulogne-sur-Mer is the more usually accepted site. The origin of the name of Ambleteuse remains uncertain. Some scholars claim it has Celtic origins (Ambleat), but that does not exclude the etymology \\"Hamel Thuys\\", a name given by the Saxons in the 6th century, as they too used the harbour when they emigrated to Great Britain. Henry VIII of England had two forts built here in 1546 to maintain a show of power towards the French kings. Ambleteuse was chosen to provide an alternative harbour, and was called the 'Newhaven.' The other fort at nearby Cap Gris Nez, was called the 'Blackness.'Colvin, Howard, ed., The History of the King's Works, vol. 3 part 1, (1975), 388-389. The forces of Henry II of France eventually conquered them in 1549. Henry, having killed all the English prisoners, then found a stock of coal in the fort. This was the first time that its use was noted on the continent. At the end of the 17th century, Sébastien Vauban constructed Fort Mahon at the mouth of the river Slack. This is the only coastal fort from that era that has been preserved in France, thanks to restoration promoted by Dr. Méraut and the geologist Monsieur Destombe, who together created the \\"Association of the friends of Ambleteuse Fort\\" in 1960. Napoleon modified the estuary of the Slack to create a harbour, from where he planned to invade England in (1805). The foundations of the harbour are still visible today. At the end of the 19th century, Ambleteuse became a popular place for holidays for people from Lille and Paris. The middle classes had become interested in sea-bathing and hunting, shooting and fishing. Oyster-beds were built in the bay, to complete the ambiance of bourgeois life. During World War II, the area fell under German military occupation. There was a concentration camp built in the environs. Between 1941 and 1943, the German engineers of Organisation Todt installed bunkers for artillery at the fort as part of work on the Atlantic Wall. In the bay of the river they also built sluices to flood the valley to prevent an Allied landing. After the Normandy Landings, Ambleteuse became the endpoint for the second \\"Operation Pluto\\" pipeline, fuelling the Allies from supplies in Kent.

The school's oldest and original building in this location is a Grade II listed structure which was previously a residential property before it was bought by the Christian Brothers in 1931. History The school was founded by the Christian Brothers in 1932. It moved into the present buildings in 1936, and was recognised by the Board of Education in the following year. St Joseph's was a direct grant grammar school until the 11-plus was abolished in Stoke in 1967, after which the grant was gradually phased out. The school re-opened as a fully independent school in 1980, and in the following years began to admit girls. In the early 1980s the school pulled out of the Catholic reorganisation of secondary provision and decided to stay private. When grant maintained schools were allowed it started to admit non- few paying pupils. It is the only grammar school in the area as the council abolished the grammar system but as a private school it was allowed to continue. After many years as a Preparatory and Senior School, the Preparatory School split off to form a new independent school elsewhere on the site, while the High School became a state-maintained grammar school. The school achieved Science College status in 2004. It is no longer a grammar-school however students must sit an entrance exam. stjosephstrentvale.com Applicants to the school are required to take an entrance examination. Approximately 75% of applicants reach the school's qualifying standard, and places are allocated among these using other criteria (faith, siblings and distance). St Joseph's has Specialist Status for Science and Mathematics and is rated as Outstanding in all areas by Ofsted. The College was amongst the first schools to convert to Academy status in 2011 and in 2012 became one of the country's first Teaching Schools. School site The school has an extensive program of rooms and labs, the biggest are SC2 and SC6 in the Science Wing. A new Science Wing was added to the old building, forming a quadrangle in the centre of the school, which contains a heart-shaped pond overlooked by a statue of the Virgin Mary, marking the end of the second millennium. A statue of Edmund Rice is located outside the Year 7 corridor. The Sixth Form Centre until 2008 was housed separately from the rest of the school in a Grade II listed building, which until 2001 was home to the Congregation of Christian Brothers who founded the school. Since their departure from the school premises in the summer of 2001, the Brothers' House has undergone extensive renovations. From September 2008 onwards, 'Stone House' further down the A34 road towards Hanford took the Brother's House's place as Sixth Form Centre. In 2018 Stone House was sold and the Sixth Form Centre was relocated to the 'Fideliter Building' - a chapel across the road from the main school site with a recent extension added - and the 'Olsen Building'. The Olsen Building is on the main school site and was built for use by Sixth Form students. In 2019 a perimeter fence and gate system was built around the school site. School song: Fideliter et Fortiter Originally, there was two extra verse in the song: When we grow old and the battle is raging, when to the wide earth's far corners we're flung; when we need faith in the conflict we're waging; shall we remember how once we were young.

Character development Noone was cast into the role after previously appearing on daytime television for a number of years appearing in rival soap opera All My Children. Noone signed a new contract with the serial in August 1999, she also incorrectly predicted that Sunset Beach would not be axed by NBC. Storylines During the entire run, Bette was a much beloved person. Although she always knew the newest gossip and eventually ended up hired by Gregory Richards (Sam Behrens) as a gossip columnist, Bette was always fun and entertaining. She had been married 7 times. During the first year, Bette was involved in a storyline involving her best friend Olivia Richards (Lesley-Anne Down). She supported her while knowing that Olivia had been in an affair with her daughter's boyfriend. She even lied to her best friend Elaine Stevens (Leigh Taylor-Young) about the whereabouts of her long-lost son. However, she did it all to protect the people she loved. Bette was also involved in a short story where her ex- husband Al Kennedy died in her hot tub. Bette had also been flirting with Eddie Connors (Peter Barton) for a while, but their love never happened because Eddie was killed off. Later, the arrival of her daughter Emily Davis (Cristi Harris) in May 1998 brought a whole new story for Bette. Their relationship was rocky, so they slowly worked on becoming closer to each other, which they finally did. In 1999, during the end, Bette found love again in A.J. Deschanel (Gordon Thomson). Reception Julia Shih of The Michigan Daily opined that Bette is one of the soap opera's most \\"annoying\\" characters because of her \\"sexual appetite\\". In 1998, for her portrayal of Bette, Noone was nominated in the category of \\"Female Scene Stealer\\" at the Soap Opera Digest Awards.

Geography A suburb located 2 miles (3 km) northwest of Arras, at the junction of the D341, D60 and D64 roads, by the banks of the river Scarpe. History Anzin St. Aubin was formed from two villages: Saint Aubin, formerly Saint Aubin in the Marsh, on the road to Arras, by the Scarpe river and Anzin, on the same road, but further east, bordering on Arras. The parish was created around the 12th century, with the church being built at Saint Aubin (the larger of the two villages). The name of Anzin (Anzinum) appears around 866-870, that of Saint Aubin (Sancti Albini of Marex) only appears in 1154. In the 16th century, the abbey at Saint Vaast built a watermill at Anzin. This mill (its remains still exist) mostly manufactured oil but also gunpowder and paper. During the years 1793–1794 the town became \\"the united brothers\\" under revolutionary leadership. The commune was first created in 1790 with the election of the first municipal council and the mayor, Noël Douchet, a 56-year-old farmer. All the property of the church was sold. In the early 19th century, Anzin grew in population and many houses were built along the old Roman road, the Chausée Brunehaut. The village was all but destroyed during World War I, having served as a base for soldiers and artillery. The church and the chateau were transformed into hospitals. The population suffered again during the Second World War, from 1939 to 1945, as more people died in battle or in captivity, while others participated in the resistance or helping prisoners to escape. Since 1950, the town has experienced strong growth as the numbers involved in farming declined. The population increased from 1052 inhabitants in 1970 to 2553 in 1990 and nearly 3000 in 2006. This is one of the largest growth rates in the Pas-de-Calais.

Archived October 18, 2011. (Sources vary.) His siblings were brothers Peter, Ted, Charles and William, the latter two of whom predeceased him, and sisters Lucielle and Gina. D'Agostino's earliest known work in the comics medium was as head colorist for Timely Comics, the 1940s forerunner of Marvel Comics. In that capacity, in 1949, he mentored new-hire Stan Goldberg, a 16-year-old colorist who would later become one of Archie Comics' most prominent cartoonists. Goldberg in 2005 recalled, \\"I found out there was an opening in the coloring department at Timely Comics, so I went up there. They needed another body to be in the room that handled the coloring, and that's where I worked. ...[T]he man who was in charge of the coloring department is still a dear friend of mine, Jon D'Agostino.\\"Adelaide Comics and Books: Stan Goldberg interview (2005); Writer and artist credits were not routinely given during this period fans and historians refer to as the Golden Age of Comic Books, making full bibliographies difficult for many of the medium's pioneering creators. D'Agostino's first confirmed comics credit is penciling and inking the seven- page romance comic story \\"Glamor Killed My Love\\" (as John D'Agostino) in Romantic Hearts No. 6 (Feb. 1952), from publisher Story Comics. Other early credits, all using the first name \\"Jon\\", include horror stories in Master Publications' Dark Mysteries No. 14 (Oct. 1953), and inking the cover and the lead Rocky Jones, Space Ranger story in the science-fiction anthology series Space Adventures No. 18 (Sept. 1955), the first of his countless works for Charlton Comics. =Later career= Through the 1950s and into the 1960s, D'Agostino fully drew or simply inked across a variety of titles for Charlton, including romance comics (Sweethearts); war comics (Attack, Fightin' Army); funny animal comics and other types of children's comics (Pudgy Pig, Timmy the Timid Ghost, Hunk); and teen humor comics (Freddy, and the TV-series licensed comic My Little Margie). He occasionally inked penciler Matt Baker under the joint pseudonym Matt Bakerino.Matt Bakerino at the Grand Comics Database As Johnny Dee, he lettered the lead story in the Marvel Comics' landmark The Amazing Spider-Man No. 1 (March 1963).The Amazing Spider-Man #1 at the Grand Comics DatabasePellerito, Mike, \\"Holiday Ha Ha's!\\" , \\"Entertainment for Every Age\\" (column), Comics Bulletin, December 19, 2006 (WebCitation archive), additionally credits D'Agostino as letterer of Spider-Man's first appearance, in Amazing Fantasy No. 15 (Sept. 1962), but the trade-paperback reprint collection Fantastic Firsts (Marvel Comics, 2002; , ) gives Artie Simek. In the mid-1960s and continuing through the 1970s, D'Agostino began contributing to Archie Comics and Gold Key Comics in addition to Charlton, both as an artist and as a letterer. In the 1980s he was inking primarily for Archie and for Marvel, including on the latter's G.I. Joe, A Real American Hero, Marvel Two-In-One, and, for Marvel's Star Comics children's imprint, Planet Terry, Heathcliff, and Royal Roy. By 1990, D'Agostino was exclusively inking for Archie, on teen-humor stories for such titles as Archie's Pals 'N' Gals, Jughead's Time Police, Hot Dog, Explorers of the Unknown (a light adventure comic starring the Archie gang), Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and the video game licensed comic Sonic the Hedgehog. D'Agostino's last known published credit was inking the cover of Betty No. 173 (June 2008),Betty #173 at the Grand Comics Database although Archie Comics said in a statement announcing his death that his last interior work would appear in Jughead Double Digest No. 166, as part of the four-part \\"Cyrano Jones\\" story, \\"and several of his covers will be seen through 2011.\\" Personal life He married his first wife, Jean D'Onofrio D'Agostino, in 1955.

History Formerly called Auchy-les-Moines, the village owes its origin to the monastery founded by Saint Sylvain, who came here from Toulouse in 700. Destroyed by the Normans, the monastery was rebuilt in the 11th century by the Counts of Hesdin, and entrusted to the Benedictine monks of St Bertin (see Saint-Omer) in 1072.

They are the only remnants of the original church, which had to be almost entirely rebuilt after its collapse in 1280. In 1415, several of the knights killed at Agincourt were buried here, including the Admiral of France, Jacques de Châtillon. Two decades later, the constant state of war forced the monks to desert the abbey, where they returned in 1457. Pillaged and burned by troops on several occasions during the 16th century, the buildings of the monastery were restored in the early 17th century.

Until 1926 it was named Auchy-lez-La-Bassée. Geography A small ex-coal mining town, now mostly a light engineering and farming commune, situated east of Béthune and southwest of Lille, at the junction of the N41 and the D163 roads. Coal mining Work on Mine 8 at Auchy-les-Mines began by the Compagnie des mines de Béthune in July 1891, and the mine was opened in November 1893. Shaft 8bis was started in November 1893. During World War I (1914–18) the front stabilized in the autumn of 1914 and a war of position began. The Mines de Béthune concession was cut in two along a line from Auchy-les-Mines to Liévin, with Mines 4 and 8 occupied by the Germans. Mine 4 (Vermelles) was recovered in December 1914, but Mine 8 (Auchy) was not recovered until the German troops withdrew at the end of the war. A long gallery led from the main Mines de Béthune concession to Mine 8 in Auchy in the northeast. Shaft 8 was blocked by the Germans between the level and the lower level, but below the blockage the French could freely work the coal seams, even under the German side. Pumps were brought back into service below the shafts to drain the sector. British soldiers of the 170th Tunneling Company established a listening system at the bottom of shaft 8bis which picked up sounds of activity in August 1917. In early September there was an underground struggle in which the Germans were forced out of the mine. Around midnight of 25–26 September 1917 the 38th German Pioneer Regiment poured about 8 tons of the suffocating gas chloropicrin into Mine 8, and carried by the ventilation systems the gas took under four hours to travel the to Mine 9 and the shaft of Mine 12. The people around the base of Shaft 8 died, but those further away escaped via the ladders of Shaft 9. After the attack a thick masonry wall was built in the main haulage gallery to isolate the sectors near shafts 8 and 8bis. The Germans blew up the casing of Shaft 8 and the heads of Shafts 8 and 8bis. The mine was reopened after the war, and finally closed in 1961.

Recorded by The Cheers, it went to #6 on the Billboard Best Selling singles chart in the fall of 1955, becoming Leiber and Stoller's first top ten pop hit. Veteran performer Vaughn Monroe covered the record, going to #38 on the Billboard charts; the song also rose to a top-10 chart appearance on the Cash Box chart (which counted songs, not records, and thus counted all cover versions of a song as one). In 1956, French chanteuse Edith Piaf recorded a French translation of the song entitled \\"L'Homme à la moto,\\" which became one of her biggest selling singles. The song tells the story of a motorcycle rider, described as \\"the terror of Highway 101,\\" and his loyal but oft- neglected girlfriend Mary Lou. In the song she pleads with him not to ride one night: \\"I've got a feeling if you ride tonight I'll grieve\\" she tells him, but he ignores her and \\"hit a screamin' diesel that was California bound.\\" When investigators arrive at the scene of the collision, they find no trace of the motorcycle or rider except for his clothes. Featuring a catchy tune and the chorus of \\"He wore black denim trousers and motorcycle boots and a black leather jacket with an eagle on the back,\\" the song was the second big hit for the Cheers, after \\"Bazoom (I Need Your Lovin').\\" It was also the first song to chart about motorcycles and the \\"new\\" motorcyclists, earning it the reputation as the first biker song. Its popularity coincided with the death of teen idol James Dean in an automobile crash in the week following the record's release, and the disappearance and presumed death of the song's subject made the song an important forerunner of the teenage tragedy song phenomenon that emerged in the early 1960s. Tom Armstrong, \\"Long Live the Teenage Tragedy Song\\", Sabotage Times, October 8, 2014. Retrieved 19 September 2016 This song was also recorded by Canadian group The Diamonds for the Coral Records label; the Diamonds later achieved fame later with \\"Little Darlin'.\\" In 1994, Chris Spedding recorded a new version of the song. It has also been recorded by Joan Morris and William Bolcom, and has become a staple of their concert repertoire. In 1959, Dodie Stevens became famous with her parody of \\"Black Denim Trousers,\\" \\"Pink Shoelaces\\", which uses a different, less tragic storyline. References and further reading * Stan Cuesta.

Trafficking, forcing people into prostitution and most forms of pimping are illegal. Licensed brothels, typically with a reception and leading to several studio apartments, are available. One estimate puts the number of street sex workers in Zurich at 5000. UNAIDS estimate there to be 20000 prostitutes in the country. The majority are foreigners from the Americas, Central Europe or the Far East. In recent years the number of full service sex workers has increased. Many workers operate using newspaper advertisements, mobile phones and secondary rented apartments, some accept credit cards. History In Switzerland, prostitution has been legal since 1942. In 1992, the sexual criminal law was revised, since then pimping and passive soliciting are no longer punishable. The Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons between Switzerland and the EU of 21 June 1999, which was extended to Romania and Bulgaria in 2009, resulted in an increase in the number of prostitutes in the country. In 2013, \\"sex boxes\\" were erected in the Altstetten district of Zurich (such as Strichplatz Depotweg) and one street where street prostitution was allowed was closed. In the same year, street prostitutes in Zurich had to buy nightly permits from a vending machine installed in the area at a cost of 5 francs. In January 2014, it was publicly announced that inmates of La Pâquerette, a social therapy department for prisoners, were allowed to visit prostitutes in the Champ-Dollon detention center near Geneva, accompanied by social therapists. Legal situation As well as Federal law, individual Cantons may also make additional provisions in the form of legislation or regulations. Street prostitution is illegal, except in specially designated areas in the major cities. Article 182 of the Swiss Criminal Code is designed to combat human trafficking, Article 195 limits the power pimps can have over prostitutes. Swiss prostitutes are self-employed: regular employment requirements such when and where to work would make the employer likely to be in breach of article 195. It is legal to advertise for \\"massages\\" in Swiss tabloid newspapers. Swiss sex workers are subject to taxation and social insurance contributions. Foreigners sex worker from the European Union can obtain permission to work for 90 days as a prostitute if they present themselves to the city authorities, undergo a police interview, and provide proof of a health insurance plan. Full service sex work is only legal if the seller is over 18 years of age, and it is a criminal act to pay for sex with anyone who is under 18 years old. This age was raised from 16 (the country's age of sexual consent) in 2013 to bring the country in line with a Council of Europe treaty signed in 2010. The maximum sentence for those who pay for sex with 16-year-old or 17-year-old prostitutes is three years in prison. The maximum sentence for pimping anyone under 18 is ten years in prison. (see Article 195 of the Criminal Code of Switzerland ). =COVID-19 pandemic= As part of the measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland, prostitution was temporarily banned by the Federal Council under Chapter 3, article 6 of the Ordinance on Measures to Combat the Coronavirus (COVID-19). On 24 March a Thai woman was arrested in Rheineck for not closing her establishment and was subsequently fined 1,500 Swiss francs. Sex boxes The local authorities in Zurich installed carport-like constructions called Verrichtungsboxen or 'sex boxes' to protect street based sex workers. In 2012, voters approved the creation of \\"sex boxes\\" in Zurich to control suburban sex work. These were described as a \\"success\\" by local authorities after a year. The measure has been criticised by several organisations as restrictive. Red-light districts There are red-light districts in most of the major Swiss cities: Zurich (Langstrasse); Bern (Lorraine); Geneva (Les Pâquis, Pâquis’ four sex centres - the only places in Geneva where the women sit behind windows); Lausanne (Sevelin); Basel (Kleinbasel) and Lugano (Loreto). Sex trafficking Switzerland is primarily a destination and, to a lesser extent, a transit country for women, children, and transgender people subjected to sex trafficking. Foreign trafficking victims originate primarily from Central and Eastern Europe—particularly Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, with increasing numbers from Nigeria and Thailand. Victims also come from China, Brazil, Cameroon, and the Dominican Republic. The number of victims among asylum-seekers continues to grow. Female victims among asylum-seekers came from Nigeria, Eritrea, and Ethiopia, and were often forced into prostitution. Male victims among asylum-seekers came primarily from Eritrea and Afghanistan and were exploited in prostitution. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Switzerland as a 'Tier 1' country.

Geography A farming village some northwest of Béthune and west of Lille, at the junction of the D916, D94 and the D187 roads. History In 1346, in retaliation for having besieged the town of Bethune, Flemish bands, commissioned by Oudart of Renty, sacked many of the neighbouring villages and particularly Busnes. The inhabitants took refuge in the church in order to protect themselves. The church was strengthened to make it more resilient to attacks. In 1383, English troops pillaged and plundered the village, on their rampages during the Hundred Years War. In 1519, the church was badly damaged and had to be rebuilt. From 1537 to 1543, during the time of wars of religion and again in 1655, the Spanish and French came in their turn, causing fires and terrible destruction. During revolutionary turmoil in 1793, demagogues from Saint-Venant decided to come to Busnes to burn the statues of the Saints in the church. The patriots of Busnes resisted valiantly and thus prevented further destruction. During the French Revolution, the church was sold and became a public building, which, in turn, served as a club, dance hall and gunpowder factory. It was not until February 20, 1802 that it again became a place of worship. The church, which over the centuries had been badly burned and repaired, was finally demolished in 1870. Construction of the new church started in the following years. The village was awarded the Croix de Guerre after World War I.

It is a small tree or large perennial shrub with one or more main stems. There is a total population count of about 950 plants, all of which are limited to areas in Martin and Palm Beach Counties in Florida.Smithsonian Marine Station Fort Pierce This is a federally listed endangered species of the United States.USFWS. Proposed endangered and threatened status for three Florida shrubs. Federal Register November 1, 1985. The branching brown, reddish, or grayish stems reach 1 to 3 meters in height. The leaves are up to 10 centimeters long, green above and gray-green on the undersides, often with rolled edges. The flower is pink to maroon in color, changing color as it ages, and has a fetid scent. It has usually four sepals and six petals. The fruit is a yellow-green, banana- scented aggregate. Its pollen is shed as permanent tetrads.Walker JW (1971) Pollen Morphology, Phytogeography, and Phylogeny of the Annonaceae. Contributions from the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University, 202: 1-130. The plant has a sturdy underground root crown that survives drought and wildfire. It is a fire-adapted species which grows at faster rates and produces plentiful flowers and fruits in the seasons following a burn. If aboveground parts are burned away the plant resprouts. This is a species of the understory which declines as other plants grow up around it and eventually shade it out. When fire comes through and burns away the surrounding vegetation, the pawpaw thrives. It is very long-lived, probably living well over a century, and able to spend much of its time in a dormant state underground before sprouting again. The fruit provides food for many animals, including gopher tortoises, raccoons, and many rodents, including beach mice. The flowers are pollinated by beetles, and several types of fly are attracted to the rotten scent. The zebra swallowtail butterfly (Eurytides marcellus) lays its eggs on the leaves and the larvae consume the leaves and flowers. This plant occurs in Florida scrub alongside sand pine (Pinus clausa), saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), and several types of oak (Quercus spp.). This rare plant is threatened by a number of forces. It depends on periodic natural fires to clear away the trees and brush that have taken over its habitat; fire suppression reduces its number and reduces the growth of individuals already present. Too much fire, however, can reduce the cover vegetation that is home to rodents which help disperse the seeds. Habitat is lost to development and habitat fragmentation has reduced the genetic variability of the already small number of individuals. Pesticides, including those used for mosquito control, may have reduced the numbers of pollinating insects.Center for Plant Conservation Of the seventeen known occurrences of the plant, ten are on protected land, and several are on private land with no protection. The plant grows in Jonathan Dickinson State Park, where the habitat is stewarded with controlled burns every six years.

The character's creation was announced in 1996 prior to the serial going on air. Series creator Aaron Spelling helped create Annie's appearance and style. Annie has been characterised as a reformed girl. The character has also been central to various fantasy sequences through her duration. These have been favoured by some of the serial's critics. Buxton has been nominated for one award for her portrayal and Annie has been branded one of the programme's most popular characters. Character development Sarah Buxton's casting was announced in October 1996, prior to Sunset Beach debuting on air. Annie was billed as a \\"sexy and spoiled resident of a local beach house.\\" The programme's creator Aaron Spelling was unhappy with the style choices for Annie that the serial's production made. Spelling decided to choose Annie's style because he felt skirts, boots and low hanging necklaces fitted the character's image. He also wanted Annie to have red hair, but was unhappy with the selection of wigs made available. He managed to convince Buxton to dye her hair from black to red. Annie is characterised as a \\"top heavy scheming vixen\\" with light morals and portrays the image of a \\"poor little rich girl\\". Annie is known for her involvement in various fantasy sequences during her tenure. The serial hired Gary Owens to do a voice over during one of Annie's fantasies. While comedian Howie Mandel and television host Jerry Springer were signed up to appear in Annie's game show fantasy. Storylines Annie was always a feisty woman. Most would say she was the best heroine on \\"Sunset Beach\\". From the first day, Annie was plotting her way to win the affections of Ben Evans (Clive Robertson), spending all her father's money and skipping college. After her father Del Douglas (John Reilly) was murdered, Annie was one of the suspects and eventually all evidence pointed at Annie, so she ran away trying to fight for her innocence. She stayed at the home of her aunt Bette Katzenkazrahi (Kathleen Noone). During that time, Annie always seemed to be plotting something. Her main enemy was Meg Cummings (Susan Ward), a woman who came to Sunset Beach from Kansas and eventually hooked up with her Internet lover Ben Evans. While trying to escape from the police, Annie found herself trapped in a coffin that was sent to the crematorium. At the time, she was presumed dead, but a few days later she reappeared at Ben's place, where she had been hiding for some time. After her father's murderer was found, Annie didn't spare time. She continued plotting against Meg, trying to get Ben to herself, and she teamed up with Tim Truman (Dax Griffin), Meg's ex-fiancé, to break them up. Every now and then, their plan worked, but eventually Meg and Ben hooked up again. She also sometimes used Eddie Connors (Peter Barton) to help her get what she wants. Then all of a sudden, Annie was involved into a different storyline. After giving up on Ben for good, Annie learned that she had to marry Gregory Richards (Sam Behrens) by the end of June 1998 in order to get her father's inheritance. Her father has been having an affair with Gregory's wife, and forcing Annie to try to break up their marriage was his revenge. Annie's opportunity came when she was asked by Gregory's daughter Caitlin Richards (Vanessa Dorman) to help her find a baby to introduce as her own. Annie found the best way to use this in her new plot. She took a newborn baby from yet main nemesis, Olivia Richards (Lesley-Anne Down), Gregory's ex-wife and Caitlin's mother. Annie gave the child to Caitlin (who was unaware that the child was her brother), and then told Olivia that her baby was born dead. Never missing out on a chance to plot, Annie came to a sudden revelation that Ben's ex-wife Maria Torres (Christina Chambers) was actually alive, and she plotted with Tim again to break up Ben and Meg. In a few months, Annie plotted her way into marrying Gregory by comforting him over the 'death' of his son and convincing him that Olivia had been drunk during the birth. She then continued trying to fight everything that she had done. Her plots were usually discovered in a while and she found herself trapped. She was always trying to get her father's money. She made it look like Olivia had been drinking by using potions of a Voodoo Priestess, Mrs. Moreau, who was often used by other characters; and that is how her baby died. Even though she was involved in her own storyline, Annie never missed a chance to fight with Meg. After her husband was presumed dead, Annie found love in Jude Cavanaugh (Sean Kanan), an undercover cop. During the time, she tried to get as much money from Gregory's will as she could. At the very end, she slowed down, made peace with Olivia and Meg, and settled down with Jude. Reception For her portrayal of Annie, Buxton was nominated in the category of \\"Outstanding heroine\\" at the 1998 Soap Opera Digest Awards. Justine Elias of The New York Times said Buxton and Anne Down showed signs of \\"becoming a classic matchup of battling soap opera vixens\\" in the respective roles of Annie and Olivia. Henry Mietkiewicz of the Toronto Star said that Annie \\"crowed gracelessly\\" during her scenes and opined that Buxton had a tendency to \\"shrilly overplay\\" Annie. A writer for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram opined that Annie often \\"stirs up a lot of trouble\\" in the serial. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said Annie was as every bit \\"hootable\\" as Olivia, but more \\"bratty and greedy\\". Julia Shih of The Michigan Daily criticised Sunset Beach for its slow-paced episodes, opining that Annie's arrest should have been over in a few minutes rather than taking up an entire episode. She added it made the episode halt to a \\"sleep-inducing state\\". The Boston Herald included Annie's various fights with Meg in their feature on the most memorable soap opera moments during 1997. Their writer Mark A. Perigard said the fights represented a growing trend of \\"female violence\\" during the previous year. On Annie's game show fantasy, Liz Smith of the Toledo Blade said \\"Fans know that only Sarah Buxton a.k.a Sunset sexpot Annie Douglas, could have such a dream!\\" Seli Groves of The Dispatch opined that Sunset Beach were using Annie's fantasies of Jerry Springer solely in a bid to gain ratings. While Merle Brown of the Daily Record, said \\"Annie is having one of those brilliant fantasy sequences and it's a corker. She's a contestant on a bizarre game show [...] Brilliant, just brilliant.\\" In the 2008 book \\"Stinkin Thinkin\\", M.J. Gunn said that Annie's dream sequences were some of the best scenes to watch on Sunset Beach. In South African magazine Drum, Annie was described as having \\"evil designs of her own\\" and becoming one of the serial's most popular characters. Simon Hughes of The Age said that Meg faced \\"stiff competition\\" in the form of Annie, for Ben's affections. He also opined that she was \\"the very sort of liberated femme to spice her small talk with salty entendres\\".

He made three appearances in the Premier League for West Ham United and made 184 appearances in the Football League for Exeter City, Leyton Orient, Plymouth Argyle, Ipswich Town, Southend United, Scunthorpe United, Rochdale and Bristol Rovers. Career Hodges played for Arsenal as a schoolboy and was capped nine times by England at under-16 level. He went on to join West Ham United and signed his first professional contract in March 1995. He was loaned out to Exeter City in September 1996, where he made his senior debut against Brighton & Hove Albion, and played in 17 league matches during his three months with the club. Shortly after returning to West Ham, he joined on loan Leyton Orient and made three league appearances in March 1997. Hodges moved to Plymouth Argyle on a two-month loan in November and appeared in ten matches, nine of which were in the league. He made his debut for West Ham in January 1998 and appeared in another four matches that season. Hodges played in his last match for West Ham during the 1998–99 season and subsequently went on loan to Ipswich Town, making four appearances, and Southend United. He scored his first goal in professional football during his time with Southend, the second against Barnet in May 1999. In the summer of 1999, Hodges was transferred to Scunthorpe United for an initial fee of £50,000, having rejected West Ham's offer of a new contract in order to play more first team football. He spent three years with Scunthorpe, scoring 20 goals in 113 league matches. He was included in the PFA Third Division Team of the Year in 2001 and again the following year. He was released in the summer of 2002, and went on to sign a two-year contract with Rochdale.

Character history =Original series= At the beginning of the original Hardy Boys series, Frank is only 16 years old (as opposed to 18 after the revisions between 1959 and 1974) and both he and Joe want to follow in their famous father, Fenton Hardy's footsteps as detectives. When the father of one of their school friends is wrongly accused of stealing, the Hardy boys take it upon themselves to clear his name and solve the mystery. After Frank and Joe solve their first case, Fenton—although he had not wanted his sons to get into the detective business because of the dangers involved—starts asking for their help on some of his cases. Fenton and his boys working together plays a bigger part in this series than in any of the following Hardy Boys series. In this series, Frank is in the same grade as Joe (who is a year younger), because he lost a year due to sickness, but in all the other series he is a grade ahead of Joe and him losing a year is never mentioned. =Casefiles= In the Casefiles, the differences between Frank and Joe are more pronounced as Joe's personality is somewhat changed because of the death of his girlfriend, Iola Morton. Frank (although the death of Iola does affect him somewhat) stays more or less the same. In the Casefiles series, the Hardy boys collaborate with The Gray Man, who works for the Network—a secret government intelligence agency—to fight the Assassins, an international terrorist organization responsible for his girl friend Iola's death. Also the Casefiles were written between the late 1980s and 1990s unlike the original series (1927–79), home computers were available, and because of this Frank's character is modernized and he becomes a PC computer buff; in one book he is even able to hack into the Bayport City computer system.The Hardy Boys Casefiles #22 Double Exposure Frank is also well-versed in the making of bombs and is also able to disassemble them, which saves his and many other's lives many times. As was the case in previous series, Joe acts as the mechanic for the boys, and is often described as being very athletic. =Super Mysteries= This was a series of 36 paperback novels in which the Hardy Boys teamed up with female teen sleuth Nancy Drew. One character arc seen throughout the series is the mutual attraction between Nancy and Frank. The couple shared a kiss twice in the series; the first in book 5, The Last Resort, when the two are trapped after an avalanche and fear that they will die. The second is in Secrets of the Nile, where they kiss on a balcony after the case is solved. However, the kiss is interrupted by Bess Marvin. Another hint at their relationship is when Nancy's longtime love interest Ned Nickerson saves her. However, a disheveled Nancy calls out Frank's name instead, believing him to be her saviour, and severely disheartening Ned. The two decide not to pursue relationships, believing that they belong with their current partners, Ned Nickerson and Callie Shaw. Both partners are jealous of the time and bond shared by the detectives, especially shown in Ned Nickerson. He greatly disapproves of Nancy's sleuthing in the series, as well as the time she spends solving them with the Hardys. Another romance is hinted between Joe Hardy and Bess Marvin, although there is much less evidence of this attraction. Neither relationship was ever given a final closure. =Undercover Brothers= In this series, Frank and Joe are both are undercover agents for American Teens Against Crime (ATAC), an organization founded by Mr. Hardy. This is the first series in which Frank and Joe are regularly single (not dating Callie Shaw and Iola Morton, as they did in previous series), and have different love interests from book to book. Frank becomes nervous around teenage girls, even though they are attracted to him more in this series than any other. In contrast, Joe, in a similar manner to his personality in the Casefiles series, is a huge flirt; however, unlike in Casefiles, girls are relatively less interested in him, preferring Frank, which greatly annoys and frustrates Joe. The brothers use a more modernized speech style, and frequently tease and get on each other's nerves; nonetheless, they are still very close and protective of each other as in all of the previous series. =Vehicles owned by Frank and Joe= Frank and Joe owned a large number of cars or automobiles. In the originals, they have motorcycles, but Joe totals his in The Shore Road Mystery and they purchase a yellow convertible soon afterwards. The car appears in the series, for over fifty books, before it is blown up in #74 Tic-Tac-Terror. Frank and Joe receive a newer model of their yellow convertible from a jewelry firm because they successfully recovered an emerald valued at $1 million dollars in the same book. The Hardy's use this new yellow convertible between #75 Trapped At Sea and #84 Revenge of the Desert Phantom, at which point Chief Collig gives the Hardy's a black, surplus police van, which the Hardy's use until Mystery Stories #190 Motocross Madness. It is unknown what the Hardy's did with their second yellow convertible after Collig gives them the van. In the Casefiles, the Hardy's second yellow convertible is blown up by the Assassins (which also kills Iola Morton). After Frank and Joe save the Bayport Mall from being destroyed by the Assassins, they are given a black van by the Bayport Mall Association. In Casefiles #100 True Thriller the van is also blown up. They finally purchase a blue van which remains with them until the end of the series. In the Undercover Brothers series, Frank and Joe own custom sport bikes, decked out with the latest in accessories. They also own a speedboat named the Sleuth, which is equipped with an Ham Radio transmitter, as is described in The Secret Warning. The boys also own, and store in the same boat house as their boat, an iceboat. The iceboat only makes one appearance in The Mystery of Cabin Island. =Sports played by Frank and Joe= Frank plays many school sports along with his brother. Frank is the captain and quarterback of the Bayport High football team,The Hardy Boys #32 The Crisscross Shadow but by the time of the later Digests, he gives up his place on the team so he can concentrate on his studies. He also does the endurance running for the Bayport High track team and is on the swim team. He also plays baseball, basketball, and soccer. Frank is also interested in martial arts, the game of chess and, in The Clue of the Broken Blade, fencing.The Hardy Boys #21 The Clue of the Broken Blade Frank Hardy Frank Hardy is the older (18) of the two Hardy brothers in The Hardy Boys novel series by Franklin W. Dixon. Frank has dark brown hair and dark eyes, and lives in the fictional town of Bayport with his parents, Fenton and Laura; his younger brother, Joe; and his aunt, Gertrude. Joe is not only Frank's younger brother, but best friend and crime-fighting partner. Working together, the two have solved countless mysteries. Around Bayport, Frank and Joe have quite a reputation as amateur detectives. The Hardy boys are often helped by their friends, most notably best buddy Chet Morton and Frank's girlfriend Callie Shaw. Compared to his brother Joe, Frank is the more logical, rational one. While Joe wants to jump straight into a situation, Frank is the one to hold him back and think through all the logical possibilities. More than once, Frank has surprised the villains by having the entire case figured out. Frank is also usually the one that must look for Joe when he gets lost or kidnapped. Although Frank spends his mornings exercising—doing weight training and karate workouts—and Joe usually gets out of bed about an hour later and stays in shape by simply playing a little football or baseball, Joe seems to be at least as athletic as Frank, if not more so.The Hardy Boys Casefiles #11 Brother Against Brother, page 20. In the Casefiles series, Joe jokingly refers to Frank as the brains of their operation and himself as the brawn. The Hardy boys make an excellent team, because their abilities mesh perfectly. Frank and Joe both attend Bayport High, along with their friends Biff Hooper, Tony Prito, Phil Cohen, Iola Morton (excluding the Casefiles) and the aforementioned Chet and Callie. Frank is said to be a bomb buff (see Countdown to Terror in which he defuses two bombs) and has disarmed an atomic bomb saving the town of Halifax. Joe Hardy Joe Hardy is 17 years old, with light blond hair, blue eyes, and a muscular frame. He resides in Bayport, along with his family. Their house is a three-story old Victorian on the corner of High and Elm Streets. His brother, Frank Hardy is his crime-fighting partner. His father, Fenton Hardy, used to work for the New York City Police Department and is currently a private investigator. His mother, Laura Hardy, is a stay-at-home mom and his aunt, Aunt Gertrude lives with them in Bayport as well. His aunt is secretly proud of the boys' investigating abilities, but always chides them when they pick up a new case. Joe's girlfriend is Iola Morton, the sister of Joe's best friend Chet Morton, in the original series. Iola is killed by a bomb in the first Casefiles novel, Dead On Target. After some time, Joe meets Vanessa Bender, and by the end of the series, the two are going steady. Some of Joe's other friends are Phil Cohen, a computer genius; Tony Prito, the manager of a famous teen hang-out place, Mr. Pizza; and Alan \\"Biff\\" Hooper, a well-built football player who has helped the Hardys on more than one case. The Hardys and their friends go to school at Bayport High. Joe may not do quite as well in school as his brother, but he still gets good grades. Phys Ed and History are his best subjects. The Hardy Boys have worked for, with, or against a number of organizations over the years. In the Casefiles they collaborate with The Gray Man, who works for the Network - a secret government intelligence agency. Also, they fight the Assassins, an international terrorist organization responsible for Iola Morton's death. In the Undercover Brothers books the boys are undercover agents for ATAC (American Teens Against Crime), an organization cofounded by Mr. Hardy. As compared to his brother Frank, Joe is more impulsive, wanting to jump straight into a situation. He often goes by his gut feeling and is usually right. Fenton Hardy Fenton Hardy is a private investigator in the popular Hardy Boys novels. Father of Frank and Joe, Mr. Hardy is married to Laura Hardy, and brother to Aunt Gertrude. After retiring as a NYPD Detective Lieutenant from the city's 71st Precinct, Hardy became a famous private investigator. He lives with his family in Bayport. He is also the co-founder of a top secret organization, ATAC, American Teens Against Crime, the agency for which his sons, Frank and Joe, work. Although in his 40s, Hardy is still one step ahead of his boys. Being healthy, fit, and smart, he quickly outwits most local criminals. Hardy owns an old Crown Victoria which he acquired from the local police force when he retired. He also was the head of the Association of Private Investigators. An excellent shot with a pistol, one Bayport criminal alleges Fenton Hardy never misses. Laura Hardy Laura Hardy is the pretty and petite stay-at-home (in the Undercover Brothers, as a librarian) mother of Frank and Joe. She is married to Fenton Hardy the private investigator and they all live in fictitious Bayport with Fenton's sister, Aunt Gertrude. Aunt Gertrude Gertrude \\"Trudy\\" Hardy is the unmarried aunt of Frank and Joe Hardy (the Hardy Boys of the title) and the sister of their father, Fenton. She is known to have a peppery temper and on more than one occasion to go \\"on the warpath\\". She owns an old Volkswagen Beetle. In the Undercover Brothers series she goes by Trudy, and sometimes Frank and Joe call her Aunt T. In some installments of the original series, Gertrude appears to be a full- time resident of the Hardy household. In others, she is often present for a visit, sometimes brief and sometimes extended. Her maternal care for the boys doesn't seem to put her in any conflict with the brothers' actual mother Laura, but her characteristics — genial overbearingness, comic frettiness, moral disapproval — make her a much more developed character. In the TV series The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew mysteries, the mother has been completely written out and Aunt Gertrude has become Frank and Joe's only maternal figure. Gertrude frequently expresses her maternal care for the boys and their friends through her cooking, and it is generally agreed (particularly by the occasionally gluttonous Chet Morton) that she excels in this area. Chet Morton Chester \\"Chet\\" Morton appears in most of The Hardy Boys books. He often tags along on the boys' little adventures. He is portrayed as stout fellow and is often described as \\"plump\\" or \\"chubby\\", with a love for food. The books describe \\"the pride of Chet's life\\" is his bright yellow jalopy which he had named \\"Queen\\" and he works on it daily to \\"soup up\\" the engine. His stature and not-athletic nature make him a frequent source of comic relief; however, it is noted that he can move fast when needed. His whimsical nature is frequently a distraction for him, though it occasionally leads to an unexpected break in the case. Throughout the original canon, Chet is always diving into new hobbies like botany in The Shore Road Mystery or ballooning in The Clue of the Hissing Serpent. Iola Morton Iola Morton is the girlfriend of Joe Hardy throughout the book series. She has dark hair, green eyes and a medium frame. Her best friend is Callie Shaw, the girlfriend of Frank Hardy. She is the sister of Hardy Boys close friend Chet Morton. She lives on a farm near Bayport with her parents and her brother. She is usually paired with Joe as he thinks \\"she was quite the nicest girl in Bayport High\\". In The Hardy Boys Casefiles first book, Dead on Target, she is killed by a car bomb meant for Frank and Joe. However, Iola appears in the Original Continuity books which ran during and long after the Casefiles series had ended. In many other Hardy Boys books she is mentioned alive. Iola is featured in The Hardy Boys: Undercover Brothers, but she and Joe are not dating. In the graphic novels also released under the Undercover Brothers banner, however, they are. Iola once again appears in the Hardy Boys Adventures series, but she is again not dating Joe. Biff Hooper Alan \\"Biff\\" Hooper is a six-foot, blond-haired, muscular friend of the Hardy boys. He excels at boxing, wrestling, and football and fencing. He has an ambling gait, \\"with which he could cover a tremendous amount of territory in a short time\\". His nickname comes from a distant relative who was a boxer named Biff. He owns a bloodhound named Sherlock and a Great Dane named Tivoli, and a motorboat named Envoy. He can play the harmonica. In one of the Casefiles he is part of \\"The Circle of Twelve\\", which is a group of vandals. He is in the group because of his girlfriend. His association with the Circle of Twelve nearly gets him killed. In the Clues Brothers series, he is depicted as a bully rather than a friend to the Hardys. He first appears in secret files #5 Monster Of A Mystery. Tony Prito Tony Prito appears in the popular The Hardy Boys book series by Franklin W. Dixon. Son of Italian immigrants and a close friend of Frank and Joe Hardy, Tony works for his father's construction company and in the Casefiles is also the manager of Bayport's local pizza parlor, Mr. Pizza. He is the owner of the motorboat Napoli, which is destroyed in #36 and replaced with the Napoli II, and drives one of the Prito Co. pickup trucks. He attends Bayport High and is a standout second baseman on the school's baseball team and a talented wide receiver on the football team. Tony is a handsome 19-year- old with curly black hair, brown eyes and olive skin. Though not big, he is wiry, with lightning quick reflexes. In Casefiles #41, Highway Robbery, it is said that he is five inches shorter and twenty pounds lighter than the Hardy boys, who are 6-1 and 6 feet, so Tony is around 5-7 or 5–8 feet. Callie Shaw Callie is the girlfriend of the elder Hardy boy, Frank Hardy. She first appeared in 1927 in the first volume of the series, and she appeared or was mentioned in almost all of the following 57 volumes (as well as most of subsequent 'Digest' series), but never had an important role until 1987 and the death of best friend Iola Morton in The Hardy Boys Casefiles #1 Dead on Target. She is a blonde with brown eyes and has a tendency to start giggling like mad for no reason. ;Original series Other than being described as ‘‘Frank's favorite date’’ and ‘‘one of the prettiest girls attending Bayport high school’’,The Hardy Boys #3 The Secret of the Old Mill (1927 edition), page 25. the virginal Callie does not have much, if any, of a role in the first 58 books; however, from book 59 (Night Of The Werewolf) till book 190 (Motocross Madness), Callie is made to be more of a modern woman (depending on the decade in which the stories were written) and is not presented to be a \\"frail\\" woman as in the stories from the 1920s to the 1970s, but she still retains her personality and characteristics of the earlier books. In the original books Callie lives with her older cousin Pollie Shaw, the proprietor of a beauty parlor in Bayport, while her parents live in the country, sending her an allowance to pay for her expenses.The Hardy Boys #3 The Secret of the Old Mill (1927 edition), page 27. By 1959, she lives with her parents, only a few blocks away from the Hardys’ home,The Hardy Boys #1 The Tower Treasure (1959 edition) where she lives for the remainder of the series, and spin-off series. ;Casefiles Callie's role is greatly increased in the Casefiles series. Following the death of Iola in book #1, no longer is she merely Frank's date, but a competitive, brave, young woman, who is always ready to assist the Hardys on their cases, whether they want her to or not. Working on their cases, Callie saves the Hardy brothers, more than once, notably in book #8 See No Evil and #80 Dead of Night. The Hardy Boys spend much of the latter novel mourning her, incorrectly thinking she has been slain. In some of the early Casefiles, she and Frank's younger brother, Joe occasionally seem to be at odds, by the end of the series however, they get along quite well. ;Undercover Brothers In this Hardy Boys series Callie's role has again been reduced; in the first 20 books of the series she only appeared once and was no longer described as Frank's girlfriend, but just as a ‘‘close friend of the Hardys’’.The Hardy Boys Undercover Brothers #5 Rocky Road, page 46-47. ;TV portraits In the 1970s TV show, The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries, Callie was played by Lisa Eilbacher. In the show Callie works part-time for the Hardy boys' dad, Fenton Hardy (Ed Gilbert). Phil Cohen Philip Cohen appears in The Hardy Boys book series by Franklin W. Dixon. A close friend of Frank Hardy, Phil is very artistic and a genius when it comes to electronics;HDA - Hardy Chum Phil Cohen in the series he often helps out the Hardys when they need a video to be digitally restored or a computer system hacked into. (However, due to the time period that the original series was set in, these talents were not discussed; instead, Phil was essentially an \\"everyman\\" that would occasionally help out the Hardys.) Phil is also skilled at painting and is a great tennis player. In The Mysterious Caravan, book #54 in the original series, it is said that he holds the county tennis championship.The Hardy Boys #54 The Mysterious Caravan Helping the Hardys, Phil has faced quite a bit of danger throughout the series, but no matter what happens, always has a good sense of humour. Phil is tall, slender, and agile with wavy brown hair, glasses and dark eyes.The Hardy Boys #55 The Witchmaster's Key Also notable is that Phil is Jewish and along with fellow Hardy Boys character Tony Prito, was one of the first fictional non-WASP characters to be portrayed as a normal, fully assimilated teenager. Chief Ezra Collig Police Chief Ezra Collig (in The Disappearing Floor, his first name is \\"Clint\\") is the Chief of the Bayport Police. Taking Shore Road out of the fictional downtown Bayport leads to his home. His acceptance of the Hardys varies from book to book; in some he welcomes their assistance, while in others he resents it, claiming his Department is capable of handling the investigations without amateur help.  Sam Radley  Sam Radley is a friend and fellow private investigator to Fenton Hardy. Sam often works for Fenton as an operative, along with Fenton's sons, Frank and Joe. Sam and his wife, Ethel Radley, live in an apartment located in the center of Bayport, not far from Fenton Hardy's house. The Radleys used to live on the second floor but they have since moved up 16 floors and to 17E. Sam is a skilled detective and tireless worker, who sometimes has to camp out at stake outs for days on end, while working for Fenton Hardy.  Ethel Radley  Ethel Radley is the wife of Sam Radley and a good friend of the Hardy family. She and her husband used to live on the second floor of an apartment house in the center of Bayport, but they have since moved to apartment E on the 17th floor. Ethel has soft gray eyes. Jerry Gilroy Jerry Gilroy was a close friend of the Hardy Boys. He appeared occasionally in the first 20 books and then again in The Short-Wave Mystery at a party hosted by Chet Morton, but was not involved again after that. Also notable is that in The Great Airport Mystery, he is referred to as Jerry Madden. Jack Wayne Jack Wayne is a veteran pilot who often flies assignments for Fenton Hardy and his boys. His plane is named Skyhappy Sal; however, it crashed and burned while the Hardy boys were investigating The Disappearing Floor. Vanessa Bender Vanessa Bender is Joe Hardy's girlfriend in most of The Hardy Boys Casefiles book series after the death of his first girlfriend, Iola Morton, in Casefiles #1 Dead on Target. Vanessa is around 17 years old and lives with her mother, Andrea Bender, on a small farm on the outskirts of Bayport. Frank and Joe Hardy (the Hardy Boys of the title) first met her some time after Iola's death when she first moved to Bayport from Manhattan, they got to know her better when they were working on a case for her mother in Casefiles #69 Mayhem in Motion. After the case was successfully wrapped up she and Joe started dating and when the Casefiles series was canceled in 1998 with the publication of #127 Dead in the Water, they were still a steady couple. Vanessa is quite tall (nearly as tall as Joe, who is ) and slender, with long, ash-blonde hair and gray-blue eyes. Belinda Conrad Belinda is the sister of Brian Conrad and a classmate of Joe Hardy's. She is smart, funny, beautiful, and has long blond hair. According to the books where she appears it is stated that she has had a monster crush on Joe's brother, Frank. The Gray Man The Gray Man is a high-ranking member of a top-secret crime-fighting organization called the Network. He is Frank and Joe Hardy's contact in the agency. He has gone by the name Edward Gray, but more often Arthur E. Gray. It is never made clear whether either of these names are his actual name, or whether the middle initial simply stands for \\"Edward\\". Very little is known of his history before he met the Hardys and even less is known of his personal life. The Hardys first met him at the funeral of Joe's girlfriend, Iola Morton, who was killed in a terrorist car bomb planted by The Assassins. Following the events of Iola's death, Frank and Joe had vowed to track down her killers, and the Gray Man was a man in the know, having battled Iola's killers previously. At first, he and the Hardys didn't see eye to eye at all and were almost always feuding, due to their conflicting views. He considered the Hardys to be just amateurs (and still somewhat does), while they didn't agree with his and the Network's often cold-hearted and violent methods (and still don't always). Gradually, however, they gained a respect (albeit a slightly grudging one) for each other, and even became good friends over time, though (as said before) he still considers them amateurs and, in turn, they don't always trust him. The Gray Man is hard to predict because he rarely shows his emotions. As such, he can come across as rather cold and uncaring. However, he can certainly be unselfish and caring when he wants to be, as well as brave when necessary. He has shown that even he has his softer, compassionate side, willing to help people who got into danger because of their connection to the Network, and, more than once, offering to trade himself as a hostage to free someone else (such as when he offered to exchange himself for the captured stewardess on a hijacked plane in Casefile #1, Dead on Target, and for Vanessa Bender in Casefiles #100, True Thriller); he will also give people (often, the Hardys) respect when they deserve it. The Gray Man has proven in various books that he is very good at hand-to-hand combat, easily flooring both of the Hardy Boys (both of whom are accomplished fighters) at various times. He can blend in with virtually any crowd, and is a short, balding man with little gray hair, gray eyes, and even a gray tint to his skin. He has been known to wear glasses, and has smoked cigarettes.The literary relationship of the Gray Man to the Cigarette Smoking Man of The X-Files is unclear. Samuel Peterson First partner, Sam Peterson is the chief of police in New York City in the Casefiles series. When he and Fenton worked together they cracked some of the toughest cases in the department's history. In Casefiles #5 Edge of Destruction he ran for Mayor of New York City, but had to pull out of the campaign because of heart problems.The Hardy Boys Casefiles #5 Edge of Destruction Peterson lives with his wife in New York, and is a powerfully built black man, with graying black hair.The Hardy Boys Casefiles #32 Blood Money Brian Conrad Brian Conrad is 17 years old, 6 feet 2 inches tall, weighs 210 lbs and has short blond hair and blue eyes. He grew up in fictional Bayport, and still lives there with his family, in a small house. Unlike the rest of the houses in the area, though, the Conrad house is very poorly kept. He goes to the same school as Frank and Joe Hardy (the Hardy Boys of the title), Bayport High, with his sister Belinda Conrad. He does not like the Hardy brothers at all and has a history of vandalism. Mrs. Conrad :First Appearance: The Hardy Boys: Undercover Brothers #5 Rocky Road (2005) Mrs. Conrad is the mother of Brian and Belinda Conrad. Joe describes her as a ‘‘fire-breathing dragon’’. Her eyes and face are red and swollen from either drinking or crying. She smokes cigars and has a bad temper.The Hardy Boys Undercover Brothers #5 Rocky Road She and her husband are miserable people and it is surprising they're still together.The Hardy Boys Undercover Brothers #10 Blown Away Adam Franklin :First Appearance: The Hardy Boys: Undercover Brothers #3 Boardwalk Bust (2005) Adam works at Bayport Airport as the Hardys’ airplane maintenance man. He is an old friend of Aunt Trudy and has even dated her once. He knows about ATAC – he has to, since Frank and Joe sometimes have to fly planes to obscure locations while on their missions. He is bald, but wears a Red Sox baseball cap. The Hardys acquired their pet parrot in Undercover Brothers #1 Extreme Danger, from \\"Wings\\" Maletta. Belinda Conrad named him Playback because he repeats many things that are said.The Hardy Boys Undercover Brothers #1 Extreme Danger He has since taken a liking to Aunt Trudy and they have a love/hate relationship Q. T. :First Appearance: The Hardy Boys: Undercover Brothers #3 Boardwalk Bust (2005) Q.T. or just Q is the director of ATAC and is usually the person who narrates the ATAC mission CDs. According to book #3 Boardwalk Bust he never smiles, but then according to some other books he has a famous cheerless smile. Q has only ever appeared in mission CDs, never in person. Mimi Morton In the Hardy Boys Secret Files series, Iola and Chet have a little sister named Mimi. Mimi Morton is the newest member of the Morton family since the Hardy Boys franchise began in 1927, with Mimi first appearing in Trouble At The Arcade (2010).

Morrow promoted and improved the S-100 bus used in many early microcomputers. Called \\"one of the microcomputer industry's iconoclasts\\" by Richard Dalton in the Whole Earth Software Catalog, Morrow was also a member of the Homebrew Computer Club. Early life and education Born in Detroit in 1934, Morrow was a high school dropout. At the age of 28, he decided to return to school, receiving a bachelor's degree in physics from Stanford University, followed by a master's degree in mathematics from the University of Oklahoma. He sought a PhD in mathematics from UC Berkeley, but while there became fascinated by computers and began working as a programmer in the computer lab there. Meanwhile, the Altair 8800 made its debut in 1975, and Morrow began attending meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club. Career Starting in 1976, he designed and sold computers, computer parts, and accessories under several company names, including Thinker Toys (changed after CBS threatened a suit as it was too close to their trademark Tinker Toys) and restarted the business as Morrow Designs. His initial product was an 8080 board with an octal-notation keypad, but it proved unappealing to hobbyists who preferred the binary notation and flip switches of the Altair 8800. Afterwards, he attempted a 16-bit machine based on the National Semiconductor PACE CPU with the help of Bill Godbout, Chuck Grant, and Mark Greenberg. Differences between him and the latter two led to their leaving to found North Star Computers. He then sold 4 KB S-100 memory boards before attempting a new computer with Howard Fulmer in 1977. The Equinox 100 was a powerful machine in an attractive cabinet, but failed to attract much attention as it used an 8080 at a time when the Z80 was rapidly taking over. Morrow turned to selling floppy drives for S-100 machines. The package (which proved quite popular) included an 8\\" external drive, controller board, CP/M, and CBASIC. In 1982, he issued the Morrow Micro Decision line, a group of single-board Z80 machines designed to answer the high price of computer hardware. A single-drive 200k system sold for under $2000 equipped with a terminal, which placed it squarely in competition with the other CP/M systems, they were respectable business machines with \\"no sex appeal\\" but an extensive software bundle, and came in a desktop case like the IBM Displaywriter they were intended to compete against. The Micro Decision series was introduced in late 1982 and offered with either one or two single-sided 3/4 height floppy drives, using a 40 track disk format with five 1024-byte sectors per track for an unformatted capacity of about 200k. The floppy controller in the Micro Decision was based around the NEC u765 FDC found in the IBM PC rather than the more common WD 17xx series FDCs. Console I/O was provided by a Lear-Siegler ADM-20 terminal. The ADM-20 had graphics support, but since it lacked any provisions for switching out of graphics mode short of power cycling the terminal, Morrow did not support the use of this feature. Later on, Morrow offered Liberty 50 terminals and officially supported the use of graphics on them. Early Micro Decisions had no Centronics port and used one of two RS-232 ports for connecting the terminal and a printer/modem. DIP switches on the ports to adjust the baud rate required taking the cover off to manipulate. A connector for attaching two external floppy drives was also provided. Micro Decisions had two major PCB revisions and three case revisions—the version 2.0 PCB was introduced in spring 1983 and added improved data separation circuitry to the floppy controller. The 34-pin external floppy port was changed to a Centronics port and adding a third and fourth floppy drive required putting them on the internal chain inside the case. Early Micro Decisions had a power supply that was inadequate to support more than two internal floppy drives; the version 2.0 PCB came with a more substantial PSU that also had a detachable power cord. There were several ROM and CP/M revisions as well; all ROM revisions except the final one were unable to access floppy drive #4 due to a bug. The final ROM revision (v3.1) also incorporated several OS features that had previously been provided on disk. The version 2.0 PCB also included a 40 pin expansion connector on it. An Intel 8253 timer was added to provide more flexible setting of the baud rates on the RS-232 ports. Although on paper, the UART serial controller chip supported 19k baud speeds, a design flaw in the serial port circuitry prevented the use of speeds greater than 9600 bps. At the same time when the version 2.0 PCBs were introduced, Morrow also began offering the MD-3 which had two double-sided, half-height floppy drives for a 400k storage capacity. The final machine in the MD series was the MD-11, a substantially upgraded machine with 128k of memory, CP/M 3.0, and an optional 10MB hard disk. The CP/M platform was rapidly displaced by the newer (yet very similar) MS-DOS/PC DOS platforms. The 16-bit 8086 architecture of the new machines enabled them to break the 64 KB RAM limit of CP/M and address up to a megabyte of RAM. CP/M's fortunes weren't helped by the user-oriented marketing of Microsoft and IBM and the lack of same by Digital Research. In 1985, Morrow released its first IBM-compatible computer, a lunchbox portable known as the Morrow Pivot II (based on its unique form factor where neither the keyboard nor the monitor folded away from the case). Produced by an outside OEM manufacturer, the same model was licensed by Morrow to Zenith Data Systems, who sold it as the Z-171. In addition to its lower cost and more prominent brand name, Zenith won an extremely profitable contract to sell computers to the US government, after the president of Morrow Designs left to go to work for Zenith. Morrow filed for bankruptcy by the end of the year.John Markoff (2003): Computer visionary George Morrow dies or here Following the collapse of his computer businesses, Morrow devoted the rest of his life to his hobby of collecting original 78 RPM jazz and dance records from the 1920s and 1930s.

Description The inscription on the Tullstorp Runestone consists of runic text on a serpent band that frames a central image consisting of a ship and a beast, which has been described as being a wolf. The stone is granite and 1.7 meters in height, and the inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr1, which is also known as Ringerike style. The original site of the Tullstorp Runestone is unknown. It was first noted in 1624 when it was installed in the wall of a church, and rediscovered when the old church in Tullstorp was torn down in 1846.Swedish National Heritage Board record for Tullstorp Runestone. Before the historical significance of runestones was understood, they were often used as materials in the construction of buildings, walls, and roads. The stone first ended up in the wall surrounding the church yard, later it was moved to the current position inside the church yard. It is dated from about 1000 AD. The ship and the wolf in the central image probably reflects the Ragnarök myth, which would make the wolf Fenrir and the ship Naglfar. See also Crumlin-Pedersen, Ole & Thye, Birgitte Munch (eds.) (1995). The Ship as Symbol in Prehistoric and Medieval Scandinavia: Papers from an International Research Seminar at the Danish National Museum, Copenhagen, 5th-7th May 1994. Nationalmuseet. p. 170. The ship is shaped like an ancient galley with beakheads both fore and aft and is unlike any known Viking ship, suggesting from its archaic form that it is a symbolic ship associated with ritual. Other inscriptions with similar features which may depict ancient, symbolic ships include DR 77 in Hjermind, DR 119 in Spentrup, DR 258 in Bösarp, and DR 328 in Holmby. The wolf has a mane and pointed ears similar to the depiction of the wolf on inscription DR 284 of the Hunnestad Monument and the two wolves on DR 314, the Lund 1 Runestone. The runic text indicates that the stone was raised as a memorial to a man named Ulfr. Besides the Ragnorok myth discussed above, it may be that the image of the wolf was inspired by this man's name, which in Old Norse means \\"Wolf.\\" It has been pointed out that the Old Norse phrase in the runic text, reistu kuml (\\"raised this monument\\"), is somewhat rare, but does appear on seven other runestones, Sm 27 in Berga, Ög 94 in Harstads, DR 13 in Skivum, DR 383 in Vester Marie, Sö 173 in Tystberga, U 735 in Långarnö (where the wording is reversed), and U 1066 in Åkerby.

Biography Lojpur was born in Veliki Bečkerek in 1930, but his entire career was connected to Belgrade. In 1958, he started performing with Sekstet M (trans. Sextet M) led by trumpeter Mile Nedeljković, which were one of the first performers of the so-called \\"električna muzika\\" (\\"electrical music\\", a former Yugoslav slang for rock and roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s). In 1959, they changed their name to Septet M (Septet M), and performed under that name until 1965. Septet M rose to fame on the dances organized at Red Star basketball courts at Kalemegdan and their summer performances in Rovinj. Their Belgrade performances, entitled Zvezdane noći (Starry Nights), consisted of covers of rock and roll standards. Lopjpur was famous for his spectacular appearance and microphone attached to his guitar. At the time, he got his nickname \\"Mile Najlon\\" (\\"Mile Nylon\\") as being one of the first in Belgrade who wore nylon shirts. On March 4, 1960, Lojpur appeared at a concert in Kolarac Concert Hall, when he was announced as \\"Belgrade Elvis Presley\\". During the 1960s, he regularly performed in kafana London. After performing in Finland for six months, he returned to Yugoslavia, where he performed in Mažestik hotel's bar until the mid-1980s. In 1975, he played himself in Srđan Karanović's TV show Grlom u jagode, which revived the spirit of Belgrade from the late 1950s. In the mid-1980s, Lojpur had his comeback, appealing to the young crowds again. He started performing with Saša Lunginović, son of his former bandmate, Dušan Lunginović. After certain time, he slowly switched to keyboards and started performing as a one-man band. In 1988, he made a guest appearance on Nikola Čuturilo's first solo album 9 lakih komada (9 Easy Steps) in the song \\"Kad je Lojpur svirao\\" (\\"When Lojpur Used to Play\\"), and in 1996 he made a guest appearance on Prljavi inspektor Blaža i Kljunovi album Plagijati i obrade (Plagiarisms and Covers) in the cover of Lojpur's old hit \\"Šumadijski Twist\\" (\\"Šumadija Twist\\"). He actively performed until 2005, when, on July 29, he died of heart attack. Legacy Although neither he nor his band made any recordings, they had a great influence on subsequent development of popular music in Serbia and Yugoslavia. His simple, but catchy lyrics are still remembered as a symbol of the beginnings of rock music in Yugoslavia.

Born a Duchess of Saxe-Lauenburg, she was the wife of Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden, a famous Imperial general who was known as the Türkenlouis. She acted as consort of the ruler of Baden-Baden (1690–1707) and then regent of Baden-Baden (1707–1727) for her son Louis George. Biography =Early life= Franziska Sibylle Augusta was born in 1675 at the Schloss Ratzeburg the second daughter of Julius Francis, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg and his wife Countess Palatine Maria Hedwig Augusta of Sulzbach. In 1676 the family moved to Schlackenwerth in Bohemia where she and her sister spent their youth. Her older sister Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe- Lauenburg was the future Grand Duchess of Tuscany as the wife of Gian Gastone de' Medici future Grand Duke of Tuscany. When their mother died in 1681, their education was entrusted to Countess Eva Polyxena of Werschowitz (d. 1699). Their education was conducted in the art of courtly etiquette in conversation, painting and music, deemed the traditional education for a female in the era. She was also taught by her grand father Christian Augustus, Count Palatine of Sulzbach. As the two sisters were the only surviving children of the duke and duchess of Saxe-Lauenburg, they were desirable candidates for marriage due to their inheritance which they would be entitled to at their father's death in 1689. At her father's death, her sister would become the duchess of Saxe- Lauenburg in her own right and would pass the duchy to her children. Their father was apparently poisoned according to court gossip, the culprit allegedly Countess Werschowitz. With his death, the Lauenburg line of the House of Ascania was extinct in the male line. However, female succession was possible by the Saxe-Lauenburgian laws. So the legal female heir to the throne, Duchess Anna Maria Franziska, and her sister Sibylle of Saxe-Lauenburg fought for the succession of the former, the elder of them. Also Julius Francis' cousin, Eleonore Charlotte of Saxe-Lauenburg-Franzhagen, claimed the succession. Their weakness was abused by Duke George William of the neighbouring Brunswick-Lunenburgian Principality of Lunenburg-Celle, who invaded Saxe-Lauenburg with his troops, thus inhibiting Anna Maria's ascension as Duchess regnant. Also other monarchies claimed the succession, evoking a conflict further involving the neighbouring duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and of Danish Holstein, as well as the five Ascanian-ruled Principalities of Anhalt, the Electorate of Saxony, which had succeeded the Saxe-Wittenbergian Ascanians in 1422, Sweden and Brandenburg. The conflict was finally settled on 9 October 1693 (Hamburger Vergleich), definitely ousting the dispossessed Anna Maria and her sister. Both sisters never gave up the claim. Emperor Leopold I rejected Celle's succession and thus retained the Saxe-Lauenburgian exclave of Hadeln, which was out of Celle's reach, in his custody. Only in 1728 his son Emperor Charles VI enfeoffed George II Augustus with Saxe-Lauenburg, finally legitimising the de facto takeover by his grandfather in 1689 and 1693. In 1731 George II Augustus also gained Hadeln from imperial custody. =Marriage= Anna Maria Franziska, c.1690 by an anonymous artist Sibylle was due to marry Prince Eugene of Savoy but preferred the other candidate, the older and impoverished Margrave of Baden-Baden who had lost practically everything due to the war with France. Sibylle was engaged to Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden, some 20 years older than she and childless. He was also known as \\"Turkish Louis\\" (Türkenlouis) due to his famous exploits against the Ottomans and his efforts against Louis XIV in the field and as part of the Imperial Army. As a result, Louis William traveled to meet his young bride in Bohemia. =Margravine of Baden-Baden= He arrived in Bohemia on 10 January 1690. The couple were officially betrothed on 14 January and the actual marriage occurred on 27 March 1690, Sibylle aged 15. The couple were supposed to be married at the Schloss Raudnitz, the main residence of the Margrave, but that had been destroyed by the French. As a result, the newlyweds stayed in Ostrov. Although a reigning prince, Louis of Baden-Baden was a retired general, twenty years older than Sibylle Auguste. The emperor had deemed that her sister marry Prince Eugene of Savoy again due to his service in the name of the emperor. As such she married Philipp Wilhelm of the Palatinate, son of Philip William, Elector Palatine and Elisabeth Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt. When Philipp Wilhelm died in 1693, she married again to Gian Gastone de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany and son of Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Marguerite Louise d'OrléansGrand daughter of Henry IV of France and Marie de' Medici (first cousin of Louis XIV). Shortly after his marriage to Sibylle was the Margrave Louis William, however, was again engaged in the war against the Ottomans. In the battle of Slankamen was his greatest triumph and took place in 1691. The exchange of letters between the young Sibylle and her husband have since been lost, but Sibylle had a close relationship with her grandfather, the Christian August, Count Palatine of Sulzbach; From these letters it is obvious that Christian August adored his youngest grand daughter. In the early years of the marriage, Sibylle was often separated from her husband and had plenty of time to cultivate her personal interests. But soon she began to worry about the management of their property, an experience from which they drew much benefit later. She wanted her future husband and moved to the side are with him from camp to camp, but this is very detrimental to their health. =Issue= The couple had nine children in all, but were destined to see most of them die in childhood. With regards to her children, Sibylle was nicknamed the unlucky: her first pregnancy ended in miscarriage; the first child lived for six months, the second for four years, the third for six years, the fourth for three years, the fifth died after four months. Of the couple's nine children, only three reached the tenth year of life - two sons and a daughter. Of the two sons, one was childless and the other had only one daughter, who in turn was childless. Sibylle's only surviving progeny are through her daughter Auguste, who married Louis d'Orléans, grandson of Louis XIV. Through Auguste, Sibylle was the great-grandmother of Louis Philippe I, King of the French. Auguste died in childbirth at age 21. #Leopold William (Günsburg, 28 November 1694 – Günsburg, March 1695), Hereditary Prince of Baden-Baden (according to other sources he lived 28 November 1695 - 19 May 1696) #Charlotte (Günsburg, 7 August 1696 – Günsburg?, 16 January 1700) #Charles Joseph (Augsburg, 30 September 1697 – Schlackenwerth, 9 March 1703), Hereditary Prince of Baden-Baden #Wilhelmine (Schlackenwerth, 14 August 1700 – Schlackenwerth, 16 May 1702).According to other sources she lived 16 August 1699 - 2 June 1700 #Louise (Nürnberg, 8/9 May 1701 – 23 September 1707) #Louis George Simpert (Ettlingen, 7 June 1702 – Rastatt, 22 October 1761), Margrave of Baden-Baden, married first Maria Anna of Schwarzenberg, later Maria Anna of Bavaria #William George Simpert (Aschaffenburg, 5 September 1703 – Baden- Baden, 16 February 1709) #Auguste Marie Johanna (Aschaffenburg, 10 November 1704 – Paris, 8 August 1726), married Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans, and had issue one surviving son. She was an ancestor of Louis Philippe I, King of France. #Augustus George Simpert (Rastatt, 14 January 1706 – Rastatt, 21 October 1771), Margrave of Baden-Baden, married Marie Victoire d'Arenberg When her second son Charles Joseph, Hereditary Prince of Baden-Baden, died in 1703, she made a first pilgrimage to Maria Einsiedeln; it was followed by another seven pilgrimages. =Regent= Her husband Louis William, died in January 1707 aged 51 of a war injury. He was succeeded by their eldest surviving son Louis George who had been Hereditary Prince of Baden-Baden since his birth in 1702. Louis George was aged five and as such, Sibylle was created the Regent of Baden-Baden in the name of her son. Sibylle's has been credited with the reconstruction of Baden-Baden, a state which had been ravaged greatly by the French during their various wars prior to Louis George's birth. Sibylle held a tight rein on the states finances and by the time of Louis George's majority in 1727, the state was once again flourishing and she had considerably augmented his own personal fortune. Whenever she could, she made pilgrimages to the next secular advisors, such as Leopold, Duke of Lorraine and the Elector Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine. She also sought spiritual support too. During her regency, she helped reconstruct as well as create many new splendid buildings including palaces, villa's as well as places of worship. With the Treaty of Rastatt in 1714, she built the Einsiedeln Chapel in Rastatt in gratitude. Louis George reached his majority on 22 October 1727 at the age of 25. Sibylle thus retired from state administration to Ettlingen Palace in Ettlingen. In her dowager years, she also carried out various improvements which were finished in the year of her death in 1733. As her only daughter was still unmarried in 1723, it was Siyblle tried to find a suitable candidate for her only daughter known as Johanna. Her mother proposed two candidates; Prince Alexander Ferdinand of Thurn and Taxis, son and heir of Anselm Franz of Thurn and Taxis, a wealthy German noble of the powerful Thurn und Taxis family and the Postmaster General of the Holy Roman Empire. The second was a French nobleman Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans. Her mother preferred the French match as it would strengthen ties with a powerful neighbour who prior to Johanna's birth, had ravaged Baden-Baden. Johanna however preferred the German match due to her roots. Johanna, however gave into her mother and agreed to the match with Louis d'Orléans and there was a proxy ceremony held at the Schloss Rastatt before she was married on 13 July 1724 Louis d'Orléans, the grandson of Louis XIV of France. Chosen for, among other reasons, her family's Catholic beliefs, she brought a comparatively small dowry of 80,000 livres to the House of Orléans. =Later years= Having retired, she made various pilgrimages and under the influence of the Cardinal Damian Hugo Philipp von Schönborn, she led a very religious life and visited various monasteries. Sibylle, born a Duchess of Saxe-Lauenburg, Margravine of Baden-Baden and Regent of Baden-Baden died at the Schloss Ettlingen on 10 July 1733 at the age of 58. As instructed in her will she was buried at the Schloss Rastatt with little pomp. Architectural legacy Siyblle had an active interest in architecture as well as property management. While living in Ostrov with her husband in the first years of their marriage, the two carried out improvements to the Weißes Schloss (White Palace). Their chosen architect was Johann Michael Sock. Sibylle's most significant legacy was Schloss Rastatt, which became the main residence of the rulers of Baden-Baden when Rastatt got promoted to city status in 1700. The residence in Rastatt is the oldest baroque residence in the German Upper Rhine area and was built according to the example of the French Palace of Versailles.During the 19th century the castle was used as headquarter of the fort She also carried out various other projects: The Schloss Rastatt in Rastatt.

Character development In 1997, it was announced that Randy Spelling had been cast as Sean. Spelling is the son of Sunset Beach creator Aaron Spelling. Sean was billed as a \\"screwed up rich kid, recently expelled from private school.\\" Sean was featured in a high- profile storyline in which an earthquake and tsunami occur in Sunset Beach. The storyline was created in a bid to gain ratings. Spelling's character becomes trapped under water with on-screen love interest Emily Davis (Cristi Harris). Spelling and Harris were required to perform stunts sequences for the scenes, though, Spelling said were fun to film. On-screen characters were flung into the sea from a capsized boat. While Spelling was dropped down an eighty degree incline wall into a water tank. Then had to tread water, until he and Harris dove down wearing formal clothes, into the safety of an air shaft. Spelling said that they found the experience \\"really disorienting\\". Storylines Sean is the son of Gregory (Sam Behrens) and Olivia Richards (Lesley-Anne Down) who always tried to find his way into life. He started a romance with Tiffany Thorne (Adrienne Frantz) and found himself in a triangle with Tiffany and Mark Wolper (Nick Stabile) he battled for her love, although it turned out that she was a gold digger. At the time, Sean was involved in a Del Douglas (John Reilly) murder mystery, when he saw a woman leaving his apartment on the night of the murder. It was eventually revealed that the person was Elaine Stevens (Leigh Taylor-Young) Sean and Tiffany became closer, but when Olivia offered money to Tiffany to get out town, she accepted it and left. The next few months, Sean was involved in a storyline in which Gregory tried to get rid of Cole, but he soon learned the truth, realizing that his father was lying to him all the time. In December 1997, Sean asked his ex- girlfriend, Elizabeth to attend a New Year's Eve party on an island and she accepted, but a mysterious killer murdered her on the boat. Sean thought Elizabeth didn't want to come, so he invited another girl, Amy Nielsen (Krissy Carlson) both Amy and Sean survived the Terror Island storyline, but it took a lot of time for Amy to get through what she experienced. In June 1998, Sean met Emily and they fell in love, but their love was constantly tested by Amy, who always tried to find a way to break them up and get Sean, also using Brad Niklaus (Michael Strickland) the teens were later involved in the Shockwave storyline and the Rosario jewels. Amy's plot paid off when she used a potion that she bought from Mrs. Moreau and led Sean to her bed. Sean and Emily broke up after Emily learned the truth, and Sean also left Amy. At the very end, Sean ended with his true love and Amy decided to find love with Brad. Reception Charlie Catchpole of the Daily Mirror said the only reason Spelling was cast as Sean was because his father created the series. Ester G. Dipasupil of the Manila Standard said that Gregory finding out that Sean stood in for Cole Deschanel (Eddie Cibrian) in jail, was a \\"riveting revelation\\" and said it made an \\"exciting episode\\". Julia Shih of The Michigan Daily opined that Sean was well acted by Spelling.

The term, which comes originally from the African Marabouts, describes the offspring of a Haitian person of mixed race: European, African, Taíno and South Asian. The Marabou label dates to the colonial period of Haiti’s history, meaning the offspring of a mulatto and a griffe person. However, Médéric-Louis-Elie Moreau de Saint-Méry, in his three-volume work on the colony,Médéric-Louis-Elie Moreau de Saint-Méry. Description topographique, physique, civile, politique et historique de la partie francaise de lisle Saint-Domingue. 3 vols.(Philadelphia, 1797). describes Marabous as the product of the union of a black and a quadroon; he says nothing concerning East Indians. The East Indian association with that term is probably due solely to the resemblance between dark-skinned Indians and marabous. Describing Marabous as an ethnic group is a stretch since the term applies to any person of mixed heritage with dark skin and straight or wavy hair. Marabous are no more an ethnic group than grimeaus, mulattoes, quadroons, or octoroons are; these terms merely describe the different phenotypes of mixed-race people.

He was formally the bishop of Huesca until the synod of Jaca transferred the ancient diocese of Huesca to the city of Jaca in 1063. In fact, Jaca was a very small city and the bishop's actual seat was the monastery of San Adrián de Sasave. In 1074, Sancho traveled to Rome to seek a papal dispensation to retire, citing physical infirmity. Given that he had personally undertaken the long journey to Rome, it is most likely that he was physically well and that his removal was sought by King Sancho I for political reasons.

Senators Bill Frist (R-Tennessee) and Russ Feingold (D-Wisconsin) introduced the bill on March 8, 2001. Senators Frist, Jesse Helms (R-North Carolina), Hillary Clinton (D-New York), and Joseph Biden (D-Delaware) sponsored the bill. The Senate passed the bill on August 1 and the House of Representatives passed the bill on December 4. President George W. Bush signed it into law on December 21. Vote overview ZDERA was passed by with 91% (396 vote) of Congress voting in favor of the bill. Of the 396 votes, 194 were Democrats, 200 were Republicans, and 2 were Independent. 3% (11 votes) of Congress voted against ZDERA: 2 Democrats, 8 Republicans, and 1 Independent. 6% (26 votes) did not vote, 15 Democrats and 11 Republicans. Policy ZDERA's policy was stated to \\"support the people of Zimbabwe in their struggle to effect peaceful, democratic change, achieve broad-based and equitable economic growth, and restore the rule of law.\\" This policy was supported by the following findings made by the U.S. Congress: # The Government of Zimbabwe was unable to participate in programs created by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and International Monetary Fund Program (IMF) to assist in the transformation and resuscitation of Zimbabwe's economy. Furthermore, said exclusion to the people of Zimbabwe from the economic and democratic benefits laid out by program donors, including the United States, was because of \\"economic mismanagement, undemocratic practices, and the costly deployment of troops to the Democratic Republic of the Congo\\" by the Zimbabwean Government. # The IMF suspended support under a \\"Stand By Arrangement\\" in September 1999 that was approved in August 1999 for economic adjustment and reform. In October 1999, all structural loans, credits, and guarantees to the Government of Zimbabwe were suspended from the International Development Association (IDA). This was followed by a complete suspension of new lending to the Government of Zimbabwe by the IDA in May 2000. By September 2000, the IDA suspended all funds to the Government of Zimbabwe for ongoing projects. Means of support ZDERA proposed two sectors of financial support for the Zimbabwean economy under the imposed sanctions. # Bilateral debt relief: the Secretary of the Treasury would conduct a review of the ability of \\"restructuring, rescheduling, or eliminating the sovereign debt of Zimbabwe held by any agency of the U.S. Government.\\" # Multilateral debt relief and other financial assistance: the Secretary of the Treasury would be allowed to direct the U.S. executive director of each multilateral development bank to \\"propose that the bank should undertake a review of the feasibility of restructuring, rescheduling, or eliminating the sovereign debt of Zimbabwe held by that bank\\" as well as to instruct the U.S. executive director of international financial organizations to which the U.S. is a member to proposition financial and technical support for Zimbabwe. Particularly if these means promoted \\"economic recovery and development, the stabilization of the Zimbabwean dollar, and the viability of Zimbabwe's democratic institutions.\\" Financial sanctions and requalifications The following criteria were included in the guidelines of ZDERA and were stipulated as law until certain criteria were fulfilled or, exceptionally, it was necessary to meet \\"basic human needs or for good governance.\\" As such, the Secretary of the Treasury instructed the U.S. executive director of each international financial institution to \\"oppose and vote against\\" the following: # any extension by the respective institution of any loan credit, or guarantee to the Government of Zimbabwe; # any cancellation or reduction of indebtedness owed by the Government of Zimbabwe to the United State or any international financial institution. The following were certifications that once satisfied would lift the aforementioned restrictions: # Restoration of the rule of law: including \\"respect for ownership and title to property, freedom of speech and association, and an end to the lawlessness, violence, and intimidation sponsored, condoned, or tolerated by the Government of Zimbabwe, the ruling party, and their supporters or entities. # Electoral Conditions: That Zimbabwe has held a presidential election that is widely accepted as free and fair and the president-elect is free to assume the duties of the office OR that the Government of Zimbabwe has sufficiently improved the pre-election environment to a degree consistent with accepted international standards for security and freedom of movement and association. # Transparent Land Reform: The Government of Zimbabwe has demonstrated a commitment to an equitable, legal, and transparent land reform program consistent with agreements reached at the International Donors' Conference on Land Reform and Resettlement in Zimbabwe held in Harare, Zimbabwe, in September 1998. # Fulfilling the agreement to end the war in the DRC: The Government of Zimbabwe is making a good faith effort to fulfill the terms of the Lusaka, Zambia, agreement on ending the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, this section was removed with the amendments to ZDERA in 2018.By S 2595 (sec 6(3)) # Military and police: The Zimbabwean Armed Forces, the National Police of Zimbabwe, and other state security forces are responsible to and serve the elected civilian government. Additional actions It was further recommended from Congress that the President should begin immediate consultations with European Union nations, Canada, and other suitable nations to identify way to # identify and share information regarding individuals responsible for the deliberate breakdown of the rule of law, politically motivated violence, and intimidation in Zimbabwe; # identify assets of those individuals held outside Zimbabwe; # implement travel and economic sanctions against those individuals and their associates and families; and # provide for the eventual removal or amendment of those sanctions. Repeal of ZDERA Bill S. 3722, the Zimbabwe Sanctions Repeal Act of 2010, sponsored by Senator James Inhofe (R-Oklahoma) was introduced into the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2010. A vote was never taken. Bill S. 1646, a Zimbabwe Sanctions Repeal Act of 2011, sponsored again by Senator James Inhofe (R-Oklahoma) was introduced into the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in October 2011. A vote has yet to be taken. Critical reception Simbi Veke Mubako, Zimbabwe's ambassador, and Cynthia McKinney (D-Georgia) accused supporters of the bill of anti-black racism. McKinney referred to the bill as \\"nothing more than a formal declaration of United States complicity in a program to maintain white-skin privilege [...] under the hypocritical guise of providing a transition to democracy.\\" References Acts of the 107th United States Congress History of Zimbabwe United States foreign relations legislation 2001 in international relations 2001 in Zimbabwe United States–Zimbabwe relations Sanctions legislation ","title":"Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001"},{"id":"12858915","text":"Béhagnies is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de-France region in northern France.

Synopsis A psychological novel of sexual slayings, lost love, the twisted nature of truth, and of ghosts in the real and figurative sense If You Could See Me Now tells the story of Miles Teagarden, a thirty-three-year-old recently widowed English professor from the East Coast of the United States, who in the summer of 1975 returns to the Midwestern town of Arden, Wisconsin, which was once home to his maternal grandmother, now deceased. Miles is struggling to complete his doctoral dissertation in order to keep his position at an unnamed educational institution in the East, and hopes the isolation of the Mississippi River farmland known to him in his youth might aid him in his goal. Teagarden is a troubled man with a tragedy-haunted past, whose personal problems may or may not be of an inwardly serious nature. Throughout his adult life certain people around him have treated him with suspicion and dislike; he has frequently been the object of whispered rumors of an ill-defined nature. Immediately prior to the novel's start he has just lost his estranged wife due to drowning, and finds himself less than welcome upon his arrival in the Wisconsin town in which he intends to spend a summer writing. Teagarden experiences what he describes as \\"olfactory hallucinations\\", which cause him to assign certain imaginary smells to people he encounters, odors such as blood, water, tooth decay, or various chemicals. He relates having experienced a supernatural event in the form of a ghostly stagecoach spilling down a dangerous stretch of roadway one night in the recent past, and acknowledges that he harbors an unquenchable obsession with his San Francisco-born cousin, Alison Greening, a year his senior. This obsession played a role in the recent failure of his marriage. Twenty years earlier – on the night of June 21, 1955 – Miles made a vow with his cousin Alison that they would meet again at the family farm in Arden, Wisconsin on the same night in 1975. Miles' expectations of his cousin keeping this meeting make up much of the novel's first half and lead to a shocking revelation that begins the second portion of the work, which shifts radically in tone and theme, as very quickly Miles' work on his dissertation falls away and he becomes obsessed with memories of the fateful summer of 1955. In the present (1975) several young women have been murdered in the area around Arden, and the suspicions of both the police force and the citizens of the town fall on Miles, who soon comes to believe that Alison may be responsible for the deaths. The novel's plot assumes the form of Miles' quest to learn the truth about the 1975 slayings, and unravel the complex scenario that ended his involvement with Alison in 1955, and in so doing colored Miles' life for the next twenty years. Themes and connections to other works The novel introduces themes that appear throughout Straub's later novels: the alienated intellectual returning home; digging through layers of memory and history to make sense of violent events in childhood; serial killers; a fictionalized rural Wisconsin setting; and the overwhelming power and attraction of sex and violence. The protagonist, Miles Teagarden, also has a cameo in Straub's novel Shadowland in which he appears at an Arizona boarding school (described by Teagarden in If You Could See Me Now as \\"prison-like\\") to inform new pupils about the institution's rules and regulations.

He was the last bishop at Roda de Isábena before the see was moved to Barbastro and his episcopate was \\"key in the development of the dominion of the diocese, with respect to both ecclesiastical jurisdiction and the formation of an ecclesial territory.\\" Raymond came to power at Roda by a special dispensation from Pope Gregory VII, who deposed his predecessor, Bishop Solomon, at the insistence of King Sancho V of Navarre and Aragon. The reasons for Solomon's fall from favour are unclear, but it may have been that he was a Catalan and his loyalty in the disputes between the County of Ribagorza, which lay within Roda's diocese and Sancho's kingdom, and the neighbouring County of Pallars, which was within the sphere of influence of the Count of Barcelona, was suspect. It may also have been that Solomon did not press the claims of Roda to territory taken away from it at the Council of Jaca (1063) as forcefully as the king would have liked. At the time, the beneficiary of the territorial adjustments of 1063 was the king's brother, García, bishop of Jaca, with whom the king was often at odds. With his own candidate, Raymond, as bishop and his own son, Pedro Sánchez, as count in Ribagorza, the king could expect to win his dispute with the counts of Pallars. Raymond pursued his diocese's claims on Sobrarbean territory. He also expanded the holdings of the cathedral of Roda and increased its economic clout in the city and its environs. The claims of the diocese of Urgell to supremacy over Roda were finally decided in the latter's favour during Raymond's tenure, but he was left with boundary disputes between the two sees. In later legends, Raymond is said to have moved the seat of the diocese to Lleida or Hictosa, identified either with Tolva or an ancient suburb of Barbastro. In the dispute with Jaca, Raymond's first claim was to the city and church of Alquézar, which was the one of the best fortified towns in the region. Raymond was also given jurisdiction by the king over churches that had been previously confirmed to the bishop of Jaca by the council of 1063, including in the town Espluga, the valleys of Arravense and Castillo Vivo and castles of Castejón andCorbera. Raymond also received for his church the right to cut wood in the royal forests (15 March 1081), and from both King Sancho and his son, Count Pedro, received the right to pasturage far from their own church lands. The church under Raymond experienced economic growth, buying up vineyards and houses in the vicinities of Roda, Lastonosa, Ibuni, Monzón and Riberas del Cinca. To curb abuses among his priests, Raymond instituted a canonical rule in the cathedral and forbade the priests to own private property. In 1084 he was captured at the battle of Morella, while supporting the king of Aragon and the taifa of Lérida against the taifa of Zaragoza. The latter's forces were led at the time by Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, the Cid of legend.

Founded as the Guaranty Bank and Trust Company in 1920, in 1922 it assumed the name Republic National Bank of Dallas. Afterwards the bank acquired several banks and invested in others, and changed its name several times. By 1948 Republic had grown to become the largest bank in Texas. The bank failed in 1988, during the savings and loan crisis. In 1988 NCNB Corporation acquired First RepublicBank and in 1991 changed its name to NationsBank. History The company first opened as the Guaranty Bank and Trust Company in 1920, founded by a University of Texas law school alumnus named Eugene DeBogory. In 1922 when Guaranty obtained a national charter it assumed the name Republic National Bank of Dallas. When the company began servicing farm and ranch loans, it was required to establish a Texas subsidiary, Republic Trust and Savings Bank, to comply with regulations governing national banks at the time. In 1928 the regulations changed, allowing the state-chartered Republic Trust and Savings Bank to be merged back into the parent company, forming the Republic National Bank and Trust Company. During the next decade Republic acquired North Texas National Bank, and invested in several other Texas banks during the banking crisis of the 1933. In 1938 the name changed again back to Republic National Bank of Dallas. By 1948 Republic had grown to become the largest bank in Texas. In the 1970s, toward the tail end of a lengthy period of expansion and acquisition, Republic acquired the Houston National Bank and held a substantial portfolio of loans to the real estate industry in Texas. In the late 1980s Savings and Loan crisis, Texas in general and Republic's loan portfolio in particular were hit hard by real estate devaluation. In efforts to remain solvent, RepublicBank Corporation in 1987 merged with InterFirst Bank Corporation, also based in Dallas, resulting in the First RepublicBank Corporation. The combined First RepublicBank was unable to weather the downturn and was shuttered within a year, in what was at the time the largest bank failure in US history.

A gun safe is a safe for one or more firearms and/or ammunition for those guns. Gun safes are primarily used to prevent access to unauthorized or unqualified persons, for burglary protection, and, in more capable safes, to protect the contents from damage during a flood, fire, or natural disaster. Access prevention is required by law in many places, necessitating a gun lock, metal gun cabinet, or gun safe. Gun safes have largely replaced the gun cabinets made of fine stained wood with etched glass fronts used for display that were commonly used decades ago, although some gun safes are made to resemble such gun cabinets. Features Gun safes may include additional security features such as fire or water protection, combination lock, digital lock, and fingerprint identification. Electronic locks as well as mechanical locks are available on many models of safes. The highest reliability exists for mechanical locks, although they are often more time consuming to open than electronic locks. Some mechanical combination locks have key locks, too, that lock the combination lock dial from turning, thereby precluding casual attempts by anyone with physical access to the safe from trying multiple combinations in the hopes of unlocking the safe. Some safes use live locking bolt technology and pry resistant metal to ensure the secure protection of its contents against forced entry. Some safes provide only protection against smash and grab burglary and unwanted access from young family members at home or outside, while other safes provide additional protection against fire and flood and other natural disasters. Vault doors are available for creating walk-in gun safes or vaults in a dedicated room or gun armory in one's home. Such rooms are also sometimes used as a dual-use gun safe or panic room, or even as a dedicated shelter for use in the case of a tornado or hurricane. Gun safes with a carved wood exterior (furniture safes) serve a primarily decorative purpose and resemble old gun cabinets used for displaying weapons in the past. Design characteristics may include wood veneer and very thick tempered glass. Some gun safes are designed to be hidden from obvious view. False walls with hinges located at one end of closets are also sometimes used to hide gun safes, although simply installing a gun safe in an existing closet with a door that closes can achieve much of the same advantages to prevent intruders from becoming aware of the existence of a gun safe. Depending on a place where the gun will be stored, different types of gun safes appeared: under the bed and bedside, in-wall, vehicle, cabinets, drawers, mirror, and nightstand. But most of them particularly handgun safes are found by various locksmiths and independent researchers to be unfit for firearm storage and to be best avoided.Small gun safe brands to avoid It is recommended that gun safes have a dehumidifier in order to prevent rust.  Gun safes in various countries  =Australia= All Australian states require that firearms must be locked in steel cabinets or safes, although wooden safes 'deemed not easily penetrable' are allowed for Category A and B weapons in all states, apart from Western Australia.Gun Safe Overview, including links to State Legislation. In most states, the law states that the ammunition (and bolt if readily removed), must be stored either in a separate safe or in a separate locked section of the safe. It is a legal requirement that the safe is bolted to the wall or floor (with exceptions in most states for safes with a mass of greater than 150 kilograms). In addition, shooters in Western Australia must have double locks on their safes if the swinging edge of the door is greater than 500 mm and less than 1500 mm. Additional locks are required for safes with a swinging edge greater than 1500 mm.Western Australian Safe Gun Storage Police may inspect the storage facility before issuing a licence, and will make random checks to ensure that legislation is being complied with. The Sporting Shooters Association of Australia endorses this policy with its \\"Secure your gun, Secure your sport\\" campaign to increase firearm safety and prevent theft. Requirements vary when transporting firearms in vehicles in different states. Most require that the gun is hidden from view, and locked so that it is not easily reached by an unauthorised person. Firearms must be unloaded and the ammunition transported in another section of the car. =Ireland= Any person applying for or renewing their gun licence in Ireland must have a gun safe installed in their home. This was made law under the Firearms (Secure Accommodation) Regulations 2009.Firearms (Secure Accommodation) Regulations 2009 Safes must be tested to the British Standard BS7558. Additional requirements including monitored alarms are necessary for those with more than 3 guns. =United Kingdom= Many gun safes sold in the UK are tested to BS BS7558/92, the British Standard for gun safes. The British Home Office recommends that new cabinets should conform to this standard. Glass fronted cabinets are legal in the U.K, provided the security glazing comply with BS5544 requirements and have no more weak spots than a full steel cabinet. If citizens do not own a gun safe, according to 'Secure Storage', it is acceptable to remove the firing mechanism from the firearm and store it in a secure container. It is then required that you lock away the rest of the firearm.http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/citation/quotes/7181 =United States= Some gun safes in the United States are tested by Underwriters Laboratories (UL). The least rigorous UL certification for safes is specified in the standard UL 1037 as Residential Security Container (RSC). RSC certification requires that the safe resist for five minutes expert attacks employing tools including screwdrivers, adjustable wrenches, pry bars, punches, chisels and hammers no heavier than 3 lb. Many gun safe manufacturers state that their gun safe is \\"DOJ approved\\". The state of California Department of Justice (DOJ) has required that any gun safe sold in California should be approved by the Regulatory Gun Safe Standards. This DOJ standard has now become a common rating for the classification of gun safes. However, in 2012, a report appeared in Forbes written by the investigative attorney and physical security specialist Marc Weber Tobias, presenting the results of his investigation into the quality of the security provided by eleven different models among three leading brands of gun safes sold in the U.S. through many retail outlets. Eight models from one of the brands are said to conform to the DOJ standard. Tobias reported that he and his colleagues found that all eleven models could be opened with one of a variety of simple implements and techniques, including bouncing and rapping, or insertion of paperclips, wires, drinking straws, screwdrivers, or brass strips that can be purchased from a hardware store. Four of the models were unlocked by a three-year-old child. (It was a fatality resulting from such an occurrence that led to the investigation.) When Tobias reported their findings to the manufacturers and retailers of the \\"safes\\", no useful dialog or corrective action resulted. Tobias concluded that the DOJ \\"Standards are woefully inadequate and do not address any of the issues that we found in any of the gun safes that we tested. If the Standards do not cover a method of entry, then they are meaningless.\\" Fireproof gun safes have an UL classification, and depending on the build of the gun safe, the inside must not get warmer than a certain temperature during a certain period of time. A common rating for gun safes is \\"350-1 hour\\" or \\"350-2 hour\\", which means that when the safe is in a fire, the inside will not get warmer than 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 1 or 2 hours. It has been noted that fireproof safes may be insecure against unauthorized entry. Potential risk Although rare, large gun safes may pose a hazardous risk to small children who could accidentally lock themselves inside one. To minimize this risk, stores should not leave large safes unlocked and unattended, and home owners should always lock them after use. Also, gun safes should in general be bolted down, both to deter crime, as well as to eliminate the possibility of the safe when empty from tipping over upon a person upon opening the door; the heaviest portion of many safes being the door. It is advised that gun safe should be installed in a place where there is little risk of fire, which is not too humid and where there is little risk of theft. Gun safe installed in a garage if visible from the street every time the owner open the garage door is considered risky. If owner don’t have any other choice, bolting the gun safe to the concrete floor of the garage and hiding it as much as one can is advisable. Humidity also poses a risk to the life of guns and gun safe. A dehumidifier to avoid moisture in your gun safe is recommended.

The Marshall Major (Model 1967 ) was a guitar amplifier made by Marshall. It was introduced in 1967 as the \\"Marshall 200\\" (in reference to the power of the amplifier). It had a plexi panel and two inputs in one channel, but in contrast with the 100 watt heads made by Marshall, the first series had split tone controls similar to the Sound City amps. For the second series, in late 1968, Marshall reverted to ordinary passive tone controls, and was called \\"Marshall Major\\". Some authors claim the first version had active tone controls but this is incorrect, the schematics for all versions are available online. The amplifier used KT88 output valves, two ECC83 preamp valves and one ECC82 valve. Approximately 1,200 of these amps were produced from 1967 to 1974; Marshall ceased production when the supply of KT88s ran out. The amplifier was used by rock musicians who needed very high volume. A notable user is Ritchie Blackmore; his Major had the two input channels cascaded into one, essentially creating the first Marshall with a master volume. Other versions The Major was also made as a PA amplifier, Model 1966 (from 1967 to 1971, with eight inputs in four channels; known in 1967 as the PA 200), and as a bass amplifier, Model 1978 (from 1967 to 1974).

Giuliano Costantini for Logan was a portable keyboard produced in two versions from 1973 to 1982. Manufactured in Italy, it was sold under both the Logan brand name and re-badged as both a Hohner and Vox product. The Vox version was called The String Thing but still featured the Logan brand name on the back of the case. The keyboard consists of four octaves split into two nearly equal sized ranges. In each of these ranges a combination of three string sounds can be mixed using faders labelled Cello, Viola and Violin. Each string sound is pitched one octave apart. In addition to the separate sets of faders for the string sounds, each range has a sustain and release fader. The lower range also features a simple monophonic synthesiser that is controlled from using faders labelled Bass and Perc. On the first version, there is a button labelled Orchestra that has hard wired settings and disables the faders for the string sounds. The second version, the String Melody II introduced in 1977, added more buttons for further hard wired settings.  Technical  It came in a heavy wooden case and weighed 23 kilograms. It has full polyphony with a variable-gain amplifier for each key and a BBD (bucket-brigade device) chorus that gives it the distinctive string synthesizer sound. Sound production begins at a high frequency square wave generator, then flows to the frequency divider, a Mostek MK50240N integrated circuit for the highest octave. These top octave frequency dividers were commonly used in electronic organs of the period. The lower octaves are divided by nine 7-stage SAJ210 dividers. The square wave passes the variable-gain amplifier built as a CV/Gate and a pulse conversion. Then the sound travels to the mixer, the chorus, a filter and the output stage. The monophonic bass sound available on the lower half of the keyboard has no variable-gain amplifier but has a low- pass filter. The percussion bass is low filtered and has an attack of 30ms and a decay of 700ms, with no release. A simple gate variable-gain amplifier is used with a 47µF capacitor, and the filter is behind it. The chorus consists of two modules – a dual low-frequency oscillator and the triple delay-line oscillator. The low-frequency oscillator puts out 0,6 Hz and 6 Hz mixed together as a tri-phase of the low-frequency oscillation to the delay-line oscillator. The delay-line oscillator consists of three TCA350 circuits – a chain of 185 MOS double transistor stages, which samples the audio signal, which is then modulated (FM) by the dual LFO so the output samples are shorter or longer.

History It has been known by various names over the centuries: in 845 as Concilium, in 1406 as Conchy-les-Waben and by 1608 as Conchie. Conchil was listed among the possessions of the abbey of Saint Riquier in the 9th century. A house known as ’’’Temple-lez-Waben’’’ was a commandery of the Templars. In 1307, two Templars from here (Raoul Monteswis and Eudes of Écuires) were captured and burnt at the stake at nearby Montreuil. As with much of this region of France, the wars of the 15th century caused major devastation. The mill, temple and many buildings were destroyed. The church, dedicated to Saint Blaise, had been established at Conchil since ancient times. In 1686, the Bishop of Amiens gave a relic of the saint to the church, which was the object of great veneration. Many pilgrims came to Conchil each February 3 and the days after, invoked St. Blaise to cure their sore throats. It is claimed that the pavilion is the former prison of Waben. It is a square building with very thick walls. Large metal rings, possibly used for shackling prisoners, can still be seen in the underground parts.

She was built for the White Star Line by Harland and Wolff, at Belfast, to serve the Olympic-class ocean liners. Background Traffic was one of the vessels commissioned by the White Star Line in 1910 to tender for their new ocean liners and , which were too large to dock in Cherbourg harbor. She and her running mate SS Nomadic ferried passengers, their baggage, mail, and ship's supplies to and from large ocean liners moored offshore. She was designed by Thomas Andrews who also designed RMS Titanic. Harland and Wolff laid down Traffic's keel on 22 December 1910 (yard number 423). She was built on slipway No. 1 next to her sister Nomadic and alongside the SS Patriotic. Later the constructions of the and will be started. Which were constructed on slipways 2 and 3, of the Arrol Gantry, respectively, and launched her on 27 April 1911, two days after her running mate, SS Nomadic? Construction The ship is 175 feet (53.5 m) length B.P. 186 feet (56.8 m) long overall and 35 feet (10.7 m) wide, with a gross registered tonnage of 640 tons. Propulsion was provided by 1 S.E. single-ended coal-fired boilers and twin compound reciprocating engines, each driving two triple-bladed propellers of 5.'6 feet (1.6 m) in diameter, which gave a service speed of 9 knots (10.5 mph; 16 km/h). Traffic is of steel construction, with steel frames, beams, bulkheads and riveted hull plating. She had four working decks with 4 cargo hold spaces beneath. She could carry up to 1,200 passengers when fully loaded. The Traffic was fitted with electric baggage conveyors, one at the fore end and one at the after end of the bridge deck, for conveying baggage to and from the upper deck. She will also have accommodations to transporting a large number of passengers, and a complete installation of electric lights. Her mid ship area was an open space with benches for passengers to wait. There are some lavatories located at the front and aft for passengers to use. Crew spaces were located in the deck below. Early life serving Olympic & Titanic The vessel then underwent sea trials on 18 May 1911, before being handed over to the White Star Line on 27 May 1911. Two days later, on 29 May, Nomadic and Traffic attended as she carried out her sea trials. The two tenders then sailed to Southampton, and then on to Cherbourg, where they were based. Traffic carried third class passengers, as well as mail, cargo and baggage, out to the White Star Line's large ocean liners, while Nomadic carried first and second class passengers. Traffic took passengers and mail out to Titanic on 10 April 1912 while the liner lay moored in the roads off the port, preparatory to beginning her maiden voyage across the Atlantic. Traffic could accommodate 1,200 third-class passengers, considerably more than Olympic and Titanic's actual third-class passenger capacity. Despite this, Nomadic also had a small third-class area below deck to accommodate for Traffic's over- spill of passengers. Wartime and postwar Traffic continued as a tender during the First World War, served as a minesweeper for the French Navy between 1917 and 1919, supported troop transports and carrying British, American and Canadian troops at the end of the First World War. Traffic and Nomadic were sold to Société Cherbourgeoise Transbordement in 1927, and continued to serve as tenders, but now called on any large vessels using the port. Traffic accidentally collided with on 5 June 1929, and sustained some damage to the starboard side of the hull. After enquiries revealed that Traffic was notoriously difficult to handle, new propellers were produced by Harland and Wolff and fitted in October 1929. The new propellers proved effective, but Traffic was nevertheless involved in another collision in December, 1929, this time involving of the Atlantic Transport Line. There was only minor damage. Minnewaska was involved in another collision two years later, this time with Nomadic on 29 November 1931, during which Nomadics bow was damaged. Nomadic and Traffics owners became Société Cherbourgeoise de Remorquage et de Sauvetage in 1934, and both ships were repainted in the new livery and renamed, Traffic becoming Ingénieur Riebell and Nomadic Ingénieur Minard. Scrapping In September 1939, Ingenieur Reibell was once again requisitioned by the French Navy, and this time transformed into a minelayer ship, registered as X23. When the German army took control of the port in June 1940 X23 was sunk in the harbor. Afterward, the ship was raised and used as a coastal patroller. Due to her disappointing performance in this role, she could only run 6 knots (for which she was not designed) they simply scrapped the former tender at Cherbourg. This was witnessed by a local ma called René Leledier, who many years before had served on board as an apprentice.

Ley lines and spirit paths, such as with corpse roads, have some similarities with these fairy paths. A fairy ring is also a path used by fairies, but in a circle, for dancing, as described by poet W. B. Yeats, \\"...the fairies dance in a place apart, Shaking their milk-white feet in a ring,...\\" The concept is usually associated with Celtic folklore, especially that of Ireland. Fairy paths and dwellings In some parts of Ireland, Brittany and GermanyLey Lines: the Greatest Landscape Mystery by Danny Sullivan, Green Magic, 2005 , ; p. 105 there were fairy or spirit paths that while being invisible nevertheless had such perceived geographical reality in the minds of the country people that building practices were adapted to ensure they were not obstructed. A significant number of the characteristics of fairy paths are shared in common with ley lines. In many parts of Northern Europe the round barrows were the traditional homes of the fairies, elves, or trolls and were avoided by the country folk. Such places were Fairy Toot in Somerset, Elf Howe barrow near Folkton, Yorkshire, and a round barrow at Beedon in Berkshire. Cornwall was and is a stronghold of fairy lore: fairies are said to dance on Carn Gluze, near St Just in Penwith.Bord, Janet & Colin (1973) Mysterious Britain. Garnstone Press. ; p. 70. In Danish Jutland there was a belief that \\"Barrow- folk\\" dwelt in barrows and were descendants of fallen angels cast out of Heaven.Northern Mythology, Comprising the Principal Popular Traditions and Superstitions of Scandinavia, North Germany, and the Netherlands, Benjamin Thorpe & E. Lumley, 1851; pp. 115–124 Likewise, it was considered bad luck to let cattle graze on any place where the Elf-folk have been, or to let the cattle mingle with the large blue cattle of the elves. However, all evils may be averted if one were to ask at an \\"Elf-barrow\\" for permission to graze cattle on their mound. Some Danish \\"Elf-barrows\\" included one near Galtebjerg, another not far from Kalundborg; one between Thisted and Aalborg that was said to be the home of an elfin smith; two near Sundby where a troll-smith would ride from one to the other followed by his apprentices and journeymen; and one at Tröstrup where according to legend a giant was buried, and it was said his daughter wandered across the fields and one day met a ploughman whom she took back to her father who then set the man free, fearing that they'd be driven out of their barrow. In Sweden similar beliefs existed and one barrow called Helvetesbacke (\\"Hell's mouth\\") that lies near Kråktorps gård, Småland, was claimed to be the burial mound of Odin.Northern Mythology, Comprising the Principal Popular Traditions and Superstitions of Scandinavia, North Germany, and the Netherlands, Benjamin Thorpe & E. Lumley, 1851; p. 50 In Germany the Wild Troop of Rodenstein was said to ride a straight path between the castles of Rodenstein and Schnellert. Also throughout Europe are Corpse roads, which are generally believed to be of the same basic belief as fairy paths and most likely share an origin.'Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery' by Danny Sullivan, Green Magic, 2005 , In Germany and the Netherlands in particular, these tend to be straight invisible lines and are known by a variety of names including Geisterweg (\\"ghost-way\\" or \\"ghost-road\\") and Helweg (\\"hell-way\\" or \\"hell-road\\") in German'Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery' by Danny Sullivan, Green Magic, 2005 , , pages. 101–103 and Doodweg (\\"death-way\\" or \\"death-road\\") in Dutch.'Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery' by Danny Sullivan, Green Magic, 2005 , , page. 189 A similarly straight road did however run straight over various burial mounds at Rösaring, Lassa in southern Sweden.'Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery' by Danny Sullivan, Green Magic, 2005 , , page. 112 Consequences of blocking fairy paths A Fairy Ring of mushrooms In Ireland, people who had illnesses or other misfortune, were said to live in houses that were \\"in the way\\" or in a \\"contrary place\\", obstructing a fairy path. An example is that of a family in which four children sickened and died, leaving the doctors baffled. The fifth child sickened and was near death, only to make a sudden and full recovery. The father told the doctor that he had consulted a wise woman who informed him that his new house extension blocked a fairy path between two fairy forts, whereupon he demolished it and his child became healthy again.Bord, Janet and Colin (1976). The Secret Country. Pub. Paul Elek, London. . p. 38. Fairies of the meadow, by Nils Blommér An example of this fairy path straightness is provided by an account concerning a croft (now a cattle shed) at Knockeencreen, Brosna, County Kerry. In an interview in the 1980s, the last human occupant told of the troubles his grandfather had experienced there, with his cattle periodically and inexplicably dying. The front door is exactly opposite the back door. The grandfather was informed by a passing Gypsy that the dwelling stands on a fairy path running between two hills. The Gypsy advised the grandfather to keep the doors slightly ajar at night to allow the fairies free passage. The advice was heeded and the problem ceased. It so happens that the building is indeed on a straight line drawn between two local hilltops, and is, moreover, at one end of a long, straight track.Where the Leylines led Wentz, W. Y. (1911). The Fairy-faith in Celtic Countries. Reprinted. Colin Smythe (1981). . p. 33. The fairies processed from Rath Ringlestown in Ireland every night and parents brought their children in before the fairies were due to pass. The path passed round several bushes which were left undisturbed by the locals. A man who cut down one bush could not get it to burn and sickened and died within a short while as a supposed consequence of his actions. The route also passed between two mud-wall houses and a man who was out at the wrong time was found dead; the fairies having taken him for getting in the way of the procession. A traditional folk tale from the Southern Shore of Newfoundland, Canada, concerns a young married couple who discovered that they had built their house on a path used by the good people, and the steps that couple take to rid themselves of fairy mischief. It seems therefore that the fairy folk had emigrated together with their human counterparts or had been in Canada from time immemorial. (audio) Home-owners have knocked corners from houses because the corner blocked the fairy path,Silver, Carole G. (1999) Strange and Secret Peoples: Fairies and Victorian Consciousness. Oxford University Press. p.47 and cottages have been built with the front and back doors in line, so that the owners could, in need, leave them both open and let the fairies troop through all night.Lenihan, Eddie and Green, Carolyn Eve (2004) Meeting The Other Crowd: The Fairy Stories of Hidden Ireland. pp.146–7 It was believed that a house built on a fairy path would suffer from midnight noises or supernatural manifestations. Ill-luck in the form of sick farm animals or personal illness could be the result and one remedy was to build small fires in several places along the fairy path, using fire from the blessed fire of Saint John's Eve that was lit every year at sunset on 23 June.Bord, Janet and Colin (1976). The Secret Country. Pub. Paul Elek, London. . pp. 26 – 27. Detecting fairy paths and overcoming their influence Some builders used to use a technique to see if the planned construction was going to be on a fairy path; they would map out the floor plan in the earth and place a pile of stones at each corner and leave it overnight, if the stones were undisturbed it was safe to build, otherwise the work would not continue. There is another theme that states if one's house is on a fairy path, one must leave the doors and windows open at night, front and back, to allow fairies to pass through. Builders were also advised against using white quartz in their stonework, as it is said to be a fairy stone. Wise-women were thought to be able to advise home builders of the existence of fairy paths, however in most folk-tales they are only consulted after the event and as a result of disturbances, bad luck, etc. A building placed on a fairy path would be demolished by the fairy folk, at least twice, often remaining standing however on the third attempt.Wentz, W. Y. (1911). The Fairy-faith in Celtic Countries. Reprinted. Colin Smythe (1981). . P. 67. Walking along fairy paths Paths that the fairies travel along are usually stated as being best avoided, however they also had certain benefits to humans, such as with 'trods' in the West of England. These are a straight-line fairy path in the grass of a field with a different shade of green to the rest. People with rheumatism sought relief by walking along these tracks, though animals avoid them. Great danger was still very much associated with using these paths at times when a supernatural procession might be using them. Fairy rings have certain elements in common with this phenomenon and were seen as 'gateways' into the realm of supernatural beings.Pennick, Nigel (1996). Celtic Sacred Landscapes. Thames & Hudson. .

Underwater fairy paths  Irish fairy paths are said to also exist under water, reminiscent of causeways in marshes at sacred sites and those to crannogs and other islands. These paths, only used by the fairy folk, ran from one island to another and were paved with coral, making them and their travellers visible to fishermen in their boats above.Pennick, Nigel (1996).

Mason was a member of the American League pennant-winning New York Yankees team. Career Mason was born in Mobile, Alabama where he attended Murphy High School. He was drafted by the Washington Senators in the 2nd round of the 1968 Major League Baseball draft. He made his major league debut with the Senators on September 26, 1971 at the age of 21. The 1971 season would be the Senator's final season in Washington D.C. before moving to Texas and changing their name to the Texas Rangers. On December 6, 1973, Mason's contract was purchased by the New York Yankees from the Rangers. He was a member of the Yankees during the 1976 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Although he did not play in the 1976 American League Championship Series, he played three games in the World Series. In his only plate appearance of the series, Mason hit a home run off Pat Zachry. This turned out to be Mason's only postseason appearance, and the Yankees' only home run of their four-game series loss. It was also the 500th home run in the history of the World Series. Because of Mason's low batting average, which hovered just over .200, his name, along with that of catcher Leo Dixon, was proposed for inclusion in a new term for poor hitting called the Mason Dixon Line (.204), which is closer to .200 than the Mendoza Line of Mario Mendoza (.215).

On 13 September, Piriform released CCleaner 5.34 and CCleaner Cloud 1.07.3191, without the malicious code. On 21 October 2019, Avast disclosed a second security breach during which hackers tried again to insert malware inside CCleaner releases. This attempt was unsuccessful.
