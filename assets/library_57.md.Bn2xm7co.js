The owner of the vehicle pays extra money to have their own choice of numbers or letters, usually portraying a recognizable phrase, slogan, or abbreviation on their plate. Sales of vanity plates are often a significant source of revenue for North American provincial and state licensing agencies. In some jurisdictions, such as British Columbia, vanity plates have a different color scheme and design.  North America  A vanity plate in Amarillo, Texas, referencing the Star Wars character Chewbacca Vanity plates are issued by every U.S. state and the District of Columbia, and every Canadian province except Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2007, the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) and Stefan Lonce, author of License to Roam: Vanity License Plates and the Stories They Tell, conducted North America's first state by state and province by province survey of vanity plates, revealing that there are 9.7 million vehicles with personalized vanity license plates. The survey ranked jurisdictions by \\"vanity plate penetration rate\\", which is the percentage of registered motor vehicles that are vanitized. Virginia has the highest U.S. vanity plate penetration rate (16.19%), followed by New Hampshire (13.99%), Illinois (13.41%), Nevada (12.73%), Montana (9.8%), Maine (9.7%), Connecticut (8.14%), New Jersey (6.8%), North Dakota (6.5%) and Vermont (6.1%). Texas had the lowest vanity plate penetration rate (0.5%). Virginia's high rate of vanity plates, in particular, was attributed to the low cost per annum compared to a standard plate: the state charges $10 more for vanity plates than for state-issued plates, compared to $50 more in Maryland and $100 more in Washington, D.C.. According to the Federal Highway Administration, in 2005 there were 242,991,747 privately owned and commercial registered automobiles, trucks, and motorcycles in the U.S., and 3.83% of eligible U.S. vehicles have vanity plates. Ontario had the highest Canadian vanity plate penetration rate (4.59%), followed by Saskatchewan (2.69%), Manitoba (1.96%), the Yukon (1.79%), and the Northwest Territories (1.75%). British Columbia had the lowest vanity plate penetration rate (0.59%) among those provinces that issue vanity plates. According to Statistics Canada, in 2006 there were 14,980,046 registered motor vehicles (excluding buses, trailers, and off-road, farm and construction vehicles) in the provinces and territories that issue vanity plates, and 2.94% of eligible Canadian vehicles have vanity plates. Massachusetts vanity plate on a parked motorcycle in Boston In some states and provinces, optional plates can also be vanity plates and are a choice of motorists who want a more distinctive personalized plate. However, the maximum number of characters on an optional plate may be lower than on a standard- issue plate. For example, the U.S. state of Virginia allows up to 7.5 characters (a space or hyphen is counted as 0.5 character) on a standard-issue plate, but only up to 6 characters on many of its optional plates. In some states, a motorist may also check the availability of a desired combination online. In New Jersey, which uses six alphanumeric characters on its plates, drivers can order vanity plates with seven characters. All U.S. states and Canadian provinces that issue vanity plates have a \\"blue list\\" of vanity plates that contains banned words, phrases, or letter/number combinations. The U.S. state of Florida, for example, has banned such plates as \\"PIMPALA\\", while the state of New York bans any plates with the letters \\"FDNY\\", \\"NYPD\\", or \\"GOD\\", among others. Often the ban is to eliminate confusion with plates used on governmental vehicles or plates used on other classes of vehicles. However, a licensing authority's discretion to deny or revoke \\"offensive\\" vanity plates is finite, as some U.S. motorists have successfully sued their state governments on that issue under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The \\"blue list\\" is not definitive; in general, the agent processing an application for a vanity plate can reject a plate if it is deemed offensive, even if the phrase does not match a banned word exactly. State DMVs have received complaints about offensive vanity plates. In this case, the DMV can revoke a plate if it is deemed offensive, even if it had been previously approved. The \\"blue list\\" may be limited to genuine vanity plates, not covering computer-generated accidents. For example, Florida's famous \\"A55 RGY\\" license plate (with the standard drawing of an orange in the middle) looks like \\"ASS ORGY\\". The state of Georgia banned the word \\"covfefe\\", a misspelling of the word \\"coverage\\" that was coined by U.S. President Donald Trump on his Twitter to its customized plates. Self-referencing vanity plate in Michigan In some cases, a plate that has already been issued can be recalled and stripped from the vehicle's owner if the plate's message is found to be in violation after it has been issued.  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, number plates are issued by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). They do not approve personalized (UK spelling \\"personalised\\") registrations (often also called private number plates and cherished number plates in the UK) if they contain words which are offensive in any widely used language. One registration to slip the net was PEN 15. The DVLA however lately have released more and more previously banned combinations such as SEX and DAM. UK plates have to match certain very strict letter/number combinations: see vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom. Registrations can be sold, or transferred from one vehicle to another, with some restrictions. Registrations can also be held on a retention document issued by the DVLA, this is perfect for dealers or if the owner is in between vehicles. The trade of number plates was started by private dealers, entrepreneurs who saw an opportunity to sell something in demand. Originally the only vanity plates allowed to be transferred were ordinary registrations that had been transferred. The DVLA began selling personalized registrations unrelated to the registration districts in 1989. More than 4.2 million registrations were sold during the first 25 years of this initiative, raising over ¬£2 billion for the UK Treasury. There is some additional flexibility available by using numbers that resemble letters (e.g., S for 5), or by using large black, yellow or white headed screws to fix the plate to the car to fill in or create a gap (e.g. in the middle of 'H' to make it look like two 1s or Is). However, the font style, size and spacing is mandated by law, making the practice illegal. The font that is used on all new number plates is called Charles Wright 2001, and was first introduced in September 2001 to coincide with the DVLA release of new style DVLA number plates. Some plates acquire significance only because of particular owners. For example, \\"COM 1C\\" was formerly owned by the comedian Jimmy Tarbuck, magician Paul Daniels had \\"MAG 1C\\", the 1967 plate \\"BEL 12E\\" is owned by the Belize High Commission, and \\"1 AFG\\" is owned by the Afghan embassy. Some personalised/private number plates/registrations have been investments compared to antiques and works of art. The first registration ever issued in the UK was \\"A 1\\". Over the years the value has increased and now thought to be worth around ¬£1,000,000. All single letter single number and single number single letter combinations seem to be the best investments. In the UK, there are a large number of private dealers who act as agents selling DVLA registrations, as well as their own stock, often purchased at auction or from private sellers. Dealers have trade associations and governing bodies with codes of practice.  Other countries  Victoria, Australia A custom plate from Shemiran, Tehran, Iran which reads 66Q666/Iran 11 (Persian: €∂€∂€∂ŸÇ€∂€∂/ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ €±€±) Latvian vanity plate Finnish vanity plate (Sari, Finnish female name) In Australia the various states offer personalised plate schemes, with some states having a yearly fee to maintain the cherished number. In the Australian states of Victoria and Queensland the proceeds from the sale of custom plates and personalised plates go towards road safety activities. , Austria, Andorra, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Iceland, Sweden, South Africa, Eswatini and Turkey also allow such license plates. German car registration law does not allow license plates such as these, but it is possible to select the two letters after the district designation and up to four numbers thereafter for a small fee. It is common in Germany for car owners to register license plates with their initials and a year or number of significance to them. For example, a man by the name of Jimmy Wales living in Berlin and born in 1966 might opt to register B‚ÄìJW 1966, providing it is still available. On November 19, 2007, Dutch Member of Parliament Paul de Krom proposed that vanity plates be introduced in the Netherlands as well, after having seen them while visiting the United States. One barrier his proposal would have to overcome would be that the RDW (the Dutch vehicle registration authority) links license plates to the actual cars as opposed to their owners. Additionally, vowels are not allowed on Dutch license plates specifically because otherwise license plates could (unintentionally) spell a word, so allowing vanity plates would be a strange match with current law. In Poland, there is an option to buy an individual number plate for an extra charge. The plate looks the same as an ordinary one, there is a letter showing the country district, then one number and then up to five letters of free choice. In the United Arab Emirates, regular number plates consist of five digits and one optional character (depending on the emirate). So-called \\"distinguished plates\\" have a special combination of digits (12345, 55555, etc.) or less than five digits and are sold at public auctions, the profit of which is used for charities. Very low numbers fetch very high prices, the record being the number one plate from Abu Dhabi, sold for 52.2 million Dirhams (). In Dubai, plate number one (without additional letter) is registered to the car of Sheikh Mohammed, ruler of Dubai. On June 15, 2017, it became possible to apply for a personalised license plate in Norway. The person registering the plate must complete an online application and pay a fee of 9000 Norwegian kroner (about US$1058). If the license plate is considered appropriate and the application is approved by an employee, the applicant will have to pay the fee within a certain time limit. If the fee is not paid, the application is denied and the sign goes back into the pool and can be reserved by others. The service was reportedly so popular that the government's Public Roads website crashed within minutes of launch. A Czech request plate. Because the letter O is prohibited, the digit 0 is used instead. It also fulfills the requirement to use at least one digit. The Czech Republic has allowed request plates since January 2017. While standard plates for automobiles, trucks, buses or trailers have 7 characters (grouped 3+4), request plates have 8 characters (3+5). For motorcycles, a standard plate has 6 characters (2+4), a request plate 7 characters (2+5). The whole string has to contain at least one digit. Plates must not contain vulgar or defamatory expressions nor names of authority offices. As with the standard plates, they cannot contain the letters G, O, Q, or W. A single plate costs a CZK 5000 charge, the whole pair CZK 10000 charge, preliminary reservation CZK 500 up to 3 months. When the plate is lost or stolen, a duplicate cannot be emitted.

With delays, the project was finally completed in 2009. Record passenger numbers and a substantial contribution to the growth of regional Victorian economies have both been attributed to the projectDowling, J; Puchalski, N Regional rail travel booming, despite delays The Age 6 June 2009 with several substantial spin-off projects and subsequent calls for further upgrades and investment. The cost of the project to the government was estimated at A$750 million. History =Background and 1999 state election= At the 1996 Victorian election, a Liberal Party government led by Jeff Kennett was re-elected on a platform of continued rationalisation of the state's public services. This program of service reduction and privatisation, later described as one of the Kennett government's most significant legacies, included breaking up the Public Transport Corporation and selling or franchising nearly all of its assets and operations, as well as cancelling or reducing train services to regional areas. During 1999, the state's V/Line rail freight operations were sold outright to Freight Victoria, a consortium led by American company RailAmerica. At the company's insistence, the government also decided to lease the majority of the intrastate network itself to the winning bidder, on the basis that the control of both track and trains would enable Freight Victoria to implement greater efficiencies. However, open access was mandated for the network under Freight Victoria's control, for other freight operators and passenger services. Later in the year, country passenger train operations under the V/Line brand were franchised to National Express, a British transport multinational, under a 15-year contract which included a commitment by the company to invest in infrastructure upgrades as well as 58 \\"high speed trains\\". In the lead up to the 1999 election, it became imperative for the Labor Party under Steve Bracks to focus on country towns most affected by the cuts to services over the previous decade, as the Liberal government appeared to be a strong chance for re-election in the suburbs of Melbourne. On 8 September, in addition to promising a Melbourne Airport rail link, Bracks announced a new commitment to invest $80 million in the Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo and Traralgon country rail lines, enabling new private infrastructure manager Freight Victoria to increase speed limits from to and therefore reduce travel times to main regional centres. The following day, the government promised $100,000 in funding to investigate the possibility of upgrading the Ballarat line alone. By the beginning of October, Bracks had indicated that he expected private rail operators would be heavily involved in the project, and promised to begin discussions by the end of that year should he be elected. The election of 18 September 1999, resulted in a hung parliament with both major parties attempting to secure a deal with three independent representatives in order to form government. Having secured a deal, the Bracks government was elected on 16 October, shocking political commentators and election analysts, who had expected Kennett to comfortably retain power for a third term. =Planning and pre-construction= In accordance with his pre-election promise, Bracks announced in December 1999 that feasibility studies and community consultation were underway and would be completed by the following April. At the same time, the government's travel time targets began to emerge, with the promise of 60- and 80-minute journeys to Ballarat and Bendigo respectively met with lukewarm support from city councils. In early 2000, Bracks committed the government to a major redevelopment of Spencer Street station, the main Melbourne country rail terminal, to bring it up to modern standards in line with the fast rail project and proposed airport link. Then, in March, the government announced that the findings of the feasibility studies supported commencement of the project, and suggested that the upgrades could be completed within four years. On 5 September of that year, the government revealed full details of the Regional Fast Rail plan for the first time. Announcing that the government's contribution would be $550 million instead of the originally promised $80 million, Bracks told media that the government had not fully understood the decrepitude of the existing network, and that while the government's payments would cover the costs of upgrading infrastructure, the private sector would fund the purchase of new rollingstock for the improved lines. The announcement also detailed that the maximum speed of the improved services would be , enabling travel times of 45 minutes to Geelong and 90 minutes to Traralgon in addition to the previously mooted targets for Ballarat and Bendigo. At the start of October, the government's ability to work with the still-new private operators of the transport system was called into question when Freight Australia (FA) ‚Äì a renamed Freight Victoria, lessor of the country rail network infrastructure ‚Äì threatened to withdraw its cooperation if the government continued to insist that it provide equitable access to other freight operators on the network. The company's argument, that the proposed pricing arrangement did not adequately reimburse FA for capital investment in the network, was supported by academics from Melbourne Business School. As an alternative, FA offered to take on accountability and project management of the RFR program in exchange for alterations to the open access scheme, an arrangement which it argued would minimise the risk to the government and encourage the private sector to invest additional funds in the project. However, the government rejected this approach, pointing out that the term of the rail network lease enabled the state to proceed with upgrade works regardless of FA's willingness to cooperate, and arguing that FA had access to the details of the proposed open access regime at the time it purchased the V/Line Freight business. In response, FA suspended further capital investment in the state's rail network, but ultimately did not rule out cooperating with the fast rail scheme. By the end of March 2001, the Liberal state opposition had begun to claim that there was little private sector interest in the project, and that the government would be forced to contribute its full cost should it go ahead. Bracks and transport minister Peter Batchelor denied the rumours, saying that formal expressions of interest would be called later in the year. A launch was held in June, where the government hoped to find investment support, but Bracks and Batchelor conceded they would fully fund the project if no additional finance could be found. Meanwhile, the government agreed to assist National Express with its purchase of new trains, as the government had demanded they be built to faster specifications than the original franchise documents envisaged. Later that month, the government suggested that the fibre optic cabling required to upgrade signalling could encourage internet service providers to join the project in order to offer connectivity to towns along the upgraded lines. A shortlist of consortiums bidding to construct the project was announced in September. The leading companies for the five bids ‚Äì Alstom, Baulderstone, John Holland, Leighton Contractors and Downer EDI Rail ‚Äì agreed to attempt to meet the government's target travel times, investigate electrifying the line to Geelong as part of the project, and finalise the requirements for property acquisition and additional costs. A separate tender was let in October for the fibre-optic cabling, with three bidders shortlisted. Bombardier Transportation was contracted as the builder of the new fast trains in late November. The VLocity trains, with a top speed of 210 km/h, were to be constructed at Bombardier's Dandenong factory at a cost of $410 million, including a 30-year maintenance agreement. Meanwhile, the government suffered sustained criticism of the project following the release of research commissioned by the National Party and carried out by ACIL Consulting, which claimed that the economic benefits of fast rail had been massively overestimated. However, the government denied the report's findings, and the Liberal Party refused to support the Nationals' stark opposition to the project, though it agreed the episode showed the plan had not been sufficiently scrutinised. Project scope Modern LED railway signals at Lara, Victoria. Because the state government's agencies did not have sufficient resources or experience to successfully procure a major rail project, the Department of Infrastructure chose to offer bidding consortia substantial freedom to submit a scope of works that would meet the government's objectives. In order to do this, the tenders for each of the four routes to be upgraded were offered separately, and civil engineering firms were encouraged to bid in partnership with signalling providers. The state's objectives included improving journey times \\"to the maximum extent possible on a value-for-money basis\\", maintaining a suitable standard of safety, achieving sustained patronage growth, minimising cost to the taxpayer and transferring risk to the private sector, and meeting ambitious deadlines for completion. Tendering firms were asked to design their bids to serve two peak services and one counter-peak on each of the Ballarat, Bendigo and Gippsland corridors. The project had five key components: * upgrading rail infrastructure: construction works were undertaken to upgrade rail infrastructure to allow trains to travel safely at speeds of up to 160 km/h on the country sections of the corridors * new fast trains: a total of 29 new VLocity trains were purchased * installation of fibre optic cable: a new fibre optic cable network was installed as part of the upgraded rail signalling and communications systems * new timetable: a revised 2006 V/Line timetable was developed, incorporating some faster and several additional train services * interconnecting bus services: improvements to connecting bus services to the fast rail regional centres. The delivery of these objectives entailed upgrading 500 km of rail lines from the track bed up, installing 400 new and upgraded railway signals, installing more than 460,000 concrete sleepers, upgrading 170 level crossings, introducing new rail safety systems (later including the Train Protection & Warning System), developing new train timetables with improved services, and the laying of new fibre optic cable along the rail corridors to allow for better signalling and also provide enhanced broadband facilities in regional area The VLocity trains began running at increased speeds from December 2005, with regular 160 km/h services beginning on the Geelong, Ballarat, and Bendigo lines on 3 September 2006. As well as reduced journey times, new timetables also increased the frequency of services, with off-peak trains arriving up to once per hour. Additional trains, with varying consist lengths to suit demand, were scheduled to operate during the peak, with one service on each line in the morning and evening peaks designated as the \\"flagship\\" service, which was scheduled to run at the journey time which had been promised. =Ballarat line= Ballarat was the first line to see V/Line's new VLocity in service on 22 December 2005. Track and signalling were upgraded to allow VLocity trains to run at 160 km/h between Deer Park West Junction and Ballarat. In addition, some deviations were built to ease curves and, in one case, to provide a considerably shorter route (the original route was retained, however, to provide a passing loop). =Geelong line= Geelong line upgrades by Victorian Premier Steve Bracks and Transport minister Peter Batchelor in February 2006 Fast Rail services were officially launched on the Geelong line on 3 February 2006. The double-track Geelong line had the track and signalling upgraded to allow VLocity trains to run at 160 km/h between Werribee and Geelong. These works were carried out in various stages between 2004 and 2006. The Geelong line already comprised two bi-directional tracks between Newport and North Geelong. 160 km/h operation is only provided for on the East track for down trains and the West track for up trains. =Bendigo line= Track and signalling was upgraded on the Bendigo line to allow VLocity trains to run at 160 km/h between Sunbury and Bendigo. Bidirectional signalling was provided between Sunbury and Kyneton. Between Kyneton and Bendigo the double-track line was singled to allow for better clearances past heritage structures, although retaining some sections of double track to form long crossing loops. The crossing loops were provided with bidirectional signalling, but only one of the two tracks was upgraded for 160 km/h running. =Traralgon line= Track and signalling on the Traralgon line was upgraded to allow VLocity trains to run at 160 km/h between Pakenham and Traralgon. Bidirectional signalling was provided on the double-track sections between Pakenham and Bunyip, and between Longwarry and Moe. 160 km/h services began on 15 October 2006, although a few selected services ran to slightly faster schedules for a week or so beforehand. However, only the former up track (now called the South track) was upgraded for 160 km/h running; VLocity trains are limited to 130 km/h on the former down track (now North track). Analysis and reception Despite being described as \\"the most ambitious reworking of country passenger train services not just in Victoria's but in Australia's history\\", the RFR project was widely and consistently criticised throughout the development, implementation and service introduction stages, with media, transport experts and Opposition politicians attacking governance failures, cost blowouts, and the project's failure to achieve its original headline promises in any meaningful way. Public reception was initially lukewarm, and broader service benefits ‚Äì that is, beyond the geographical extent of the project and its \\"flagship\\" express services ‚Äì did not immediately materialise due to the project's limitations. However, in the years following completion of the RFR project, patronage on V/Line services began to increase at an unprecedented rate, stimulating continued investment in rollingstock and infrastructure. Consequently, a decade after the project's completion, the RFR program had been identified as the beginning of a radical transformation of the role and nature of regional rail services in Victoria. =Costs= The Government originally hoped that most of the cost of the project would be borne by the private sector with a taxpayer investment of A$80 million. However, when this support failed to materialise, the Government decided to pay for the entire A$550 million project. In addition, the project ran overtime and over budget with the eventual cost estimated at A$750 million. =Time savings= The original promise was for trains to run to Geelong in 45 minutes, Ballarat in 60 minutes, Bendigo in 80 minutes, and Traralgon in 90 minutes. However, this was soon changed to add four minutes to each journey. In the 2007 V/Line timetables, it takes the Traralgon service 111 minutes to the city. However, even these times were only for a few trains each day that would run express between Melbourne and the respective regional cities. Furthermore, the number of trains that would run to these schedules was cut to one each way each day. Even though most journey times are now faster than before the project, the public impression is that time savings are minimal. By 2011, successive timetable changes had drastically slowed services. The Ballarat line alone at least 10 minutes has been added to the average journey following the decision to remove \\"flagship\\" express services by the Baillieu Ministry.McIlroy, Tom. Ballarat commuter anger: V/Line drops express The Courier. 25 April 2011 =Bendigo line singling= Although the early plans were altered to allow for longer crossing loops on the single track sections, the removal of one of the existing two tracks from much of the Bendigo line reduced its capacity and timekeeping of train services. The resulting delays were added to by delays affecting trains on the metropolitan section of the line between Watergardens and Southern Cross (Melbourne) stations. The installation of broad gauge sleepers, rather than gauge-convertible sleepers which would allow later conversion to standard gauge, was also the source of criticism. A spokesman for the Better Rail Action Group has claimed that the reason for eliminating the double track was to save maintenance costs, rather than for technical reasons. =Broadband access= The promised spin-off, broadband access to communities such as Ballan and VLine commuters, did not eventuate due to the government's unwillingness to fund breakout points.http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/07/09/2298907.htm A further criticism is the lack of provision for Wi-Fi on the trains themselves for business travellers.Price, Nic [Internet call for V/Line rail services] Melbourne Leader. 19 July 2010 =Patronage= V/Line passenger figures (in million passenger trips) illustrating the dramatic effect on passenger numbers of Regional Fast Rail Project roll out Despite some initial setbacks, by 2009 the project was being hailed as an unexpected success, spurring record passenger numbers and substantially contributing to the growth of regional Victorian economies. Legacy In the years following the completion of the RFR program, a number of further large-scale investments in the regional rail network were proposed and completed. Some of these projects are directly attributable to the problems of the patronage growth which resulted from the RFR upgrades; others focus on similar aims to those of the original project, such as improving travel times and reliability. =Additional VLocity purchases= Further orders for VLocity trains were placed regularly following the completion of the RFR. Additionally, from 2008, intermediate carriages were ordered, creating a fleet of 3-car sets in place of the original 2-car trains. As of 2018, a total of 261 carriages in 87 sets are in service or on order, compared to the original order of 76 carriages in 38 sets. =Regional Rail Link= Another legacy of the Regional Fast Rail project is the A$4 billion Regional Rail Link project which aims to separate regional trains on the Geelong, Ballarat, and Bendigo lines from suburban rail movements in the Melbourne metropolitan area. This is designed to increase the reliability and frequency of trains to and from Melbourne on the regional rail network. =Passenger Information Display Systems= In 2015 a project was completed to provide realtime Passenger Information Display Systems (PIDS) to 33 stations in the RFR service area. This included the provision of LCD screens on platforms and in waiting rooms, and new public announcement and customer help points (push button information speakers) on platforms. The project was managed by VicTrack, with contract work completed by 4Tel, Axent, and Metromatics. The project was nominated in the Control Systems, Networks, Information Processing and Telecommunications category of the 2016 Engineers Australia (Victoria) Engineering Excellence Awards and received a High Commendation.

The club also has affiliations with the many schools, both primary and post- primary, in this wide catchment area. The liaison between the club and schools offers parents and children a consistent engagement in sporting and non- sporting activities. Na Fianna has been a leading proponent of Irish culture and the Na Fianna C√©il√≠ has long since been a tradition of the club. The club‚Äôs involvement in GAA Sc√≥r is an extension of its own regular internal Sc√≥r sessions. \` Football Na Fianna have won the Dublin Senior Football Championship on five occasions, firstly in 1969 and for the second time, exactly ten years later in 1979. They eventually began their famous championship treble exactly twenty years later in 1999 and continued in 2000 and 2001. After winning the Dublin Senior Football Championship in 1999, they went on to win the Leinster Senior Club Football Championship later that year defeating Sarsfield's, 1-11 to 0-8. They defeated Crossmolina Deel Rovers in the All-Ireland semi-final to qualify for the 2000 All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship final against Crossmaglen Rangers of Armagh. Na Fianna were defeated in the final by a scoreline of 1-14 to 0-12. The match was played on St. Patricks Day in Croke Park with an attendance of 31,965. Na Fianna Senior Ladies' team won the County Championship in 2009, the first time the ladies' section have won a championship at senior level. The final score was Na Fianna 1-11 Naomh Mearnog 1-10. The senior ladies' won their second title against Ballyboden St. Enda's in July 2011. The scoreline was 4-12 to 2-08. They went on to defeat Sarsfields from Laois in the Leinster Final on Sunday, 23 October 2011 on a scoreline of 3-03 to 0-10. They progressed to the All-Ireland Final as a result of defeating Donaghmore from County Cork on a scoreline of 2-09 to 0-10. Na Fianna contested the All-Ireland final on 27 November 2011 but unfortunately were defeated by Carnacon from County Mayo on a scoreline of 2-12 to 2-4. In 2010 Na Fianna's Under 14 football team won the Feile Peile na nOg Division One All-Ireland title for the first time in the club's history. Na Fianna's Minor (Under 18) Football team have won the Dublin Minor Football \\"A\\" Championship 7 times in 1960, 1965, 1974, 1975, 2008, 2009 and 2014. In 2013 Na Fianna completed a 3 in a row of Dublin Under 21 Football \\"A\\" Football Championship titles, defeating Ballyboden St. Enda's on a scoreline of 1-8 to 1-6. On a great day for the club, the second Under 21 team won the \\"C\\" Championship final, defeating Clan na Gael Fontenoy, 3-9 to 0-3.

Unlike the nearby Wakefield Westgate railway station, Kirkgate is unstaffed. The station is managed by Northern but also served by Grand Central. It is on the Hallam, Pontefract and Huddersfield lines. It has a limited number of services to London King's Cross.  History  Wakefield Kirkgate platform, 2013 The original Kirkgate station opened by the Manchester and Leeds Railway in 1840 was the only station in Wakefield until Westgate was opened in 1867. The railway station building dates from 1854. Some demolition work took place in 1972, removing buildings on the island platform and the roof with its original ironwork canopy which covered the whole station. A wall remains as evidence of these buildings. After this, Kirkgate was listed in 1979. Since Westgate developed as Wakefield's main railway station, Kirkgate was neglected for many years and deteriorated until it was in a poor state of repair. In January 2008 the former goods warehouse was demolished to make way for a depot for Network Rail. In October 2008, part of the station wall collapsed, destroying a parked car. The station is unstaffed and, despite the presence of CCTV, it suffered from crime. A rape, a serious assault and several robberies took place there. In July 2009, Kirkgate station was visited by Secretary of State for Transport Lord Adonis who dubbed it \\"the worst medium-large station in Britain\\". Local consensus was that the state of its facilities discouraged its use.  Refurbishment 2013‚Äì15  Following a campaign supported by the Wakefield Express newspaper, plans to redevelop the stationhttp://www.wymetro.com/ProjectsAndPlans/SchemesUnderDevelopment/WakefieldKirkgateStationRedevelopment.htm were formulated. In July 2011, Wakefield Council was asked to decide upon a ¬£500,000 grant to the environmental regeneration charity Groundwork UK as part of its ¬£4 million Kirkgate project in which new life would be breathed into the area. The proposal was approved and funds raised in March 2013. The work was carried out in two phases between 2013 and 2015. Work completed by June 2013 included the following items: * Removal of life-expired and unused canopies * Refurbishment and reglazing of the Leeds-bound canopy * Creation of new entrances to the subway * Installation of electronic information screens on the platforms and entrance hall A second phase of work, completed in September 2015,\\"Wakefield Kirkgate Opens after ¬£5.6 million revampYorkshire Evening Post article 14 September 2015UK Government, https://www.gov.uk/government/news/transport-minister-opens-wakefield- kirkgate-station included * Units for new businesses * Caf√© * Retail outlet * Exhibition spaces * Meeting rooms for community and local business * Accommodation for Groundwork Wakefield Grand Central opened a first class lounge for its customers in April 2017. Usage Figures for annual passenger usage at Kirkgate have been comparatively low, with only 769 tickets sold to/from the station in the 2006/07 financial year.Office of Rail Regulation statistics This is because most tickets are bought to Wakefield Stations, and it is hard to determine the true use of both Wakefield Westgate and Kirkgate, as separate entities. However, after changes in the way the statistics are split, Kirkgate's usage figure has increased dramatically to a value which more accurately reflects its true usage. Additionally over 61,000 interchanges were recorded during the same period.  Station layout  Platform 1 ‚Äì Served by northbound Northern services to and , and also by services to and from .

It is one of the largest growers of deciduous fruit, nut and shade trees in the state, farming more than on a four-year rotation, growing more than two million trees a year. Its growing grounds are east of Modesto, California near Hickman, California, and its regional office and variety test block are situated east of Reedley, California.Dave Wilson Nursery web site According to the 2005 San Francisco Chronicle article cited above, the nursery holds about 40 tastings of its fruit each year in different towns. Writer and nursery expert Geoffrey Coffey said of one such tasting: :We sat at long tables with white linen and our first course arrived: a handful of blueberries on a paper plate. We sampled five plates of anonymous berries in rapid succession and ranked them for sugar, acid, texture, attractiveness, physical maturity, ripeness, and overall flavor. My tongue was soon stained deep purple and my understanding of \\"the essence of blueberry\\" forever complicated. The fourth berry we tasted, later identified as \\"Reveille,\\" topped my list for its firm texture and those stirring bugle riffs of flavor. But I found most amazing the sheer differences in size, texture, and taste between the various cultivars. The nursery, says its website, is the primary licensee and propagator (in the United States) of new fruit varieties developed by Zaiger's Genetics, including the Pluot and the Aprium.

It was revised in the summer of 1879 and again in December 1888. The first version received heavy criticism from Nikolai Rubinstein, Tchaikovsky's desired pianist. Rubinstein later repudiated his previous accusations and became a fervent champion of the work. It is one of the most popular of Tchaikovsky's compositions and among the best known of all piano concertos.Steinberg, 480. Instrumentation The work is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in B, two bassoons, four horns in F, two trumpets in F, three trombones (two tenor, one bass), timpani, solo piano, and strings. Structure The concerto follows the traditional form of three movements: A standard performance lasts between 30 and 36 minutes, the majority of which is taken up by the first movement. = I. Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso ‚Äì Allegro con spirito = 1st movement incipit The first movement starts with a short horn theme in B minor, accompanied by orchestral chords which quickly modulate to the lyrical and passionate theme in D major. This subsidiary theme is heard three times, the last of which is preceded by a piano cadenza,Borg- Wheeler 2016. and never appears again throughout the movement. The introduction ends in a subdued manner. The exposition proper then begins in the concerto's tonic minor key, with a Ukrainian folk theme based on a melody that Tchaikovsky heard performed by blind lirnyks at a market in Kamianka (near Kyiv). A short transitional passage is a call and response section on the tutti and the piano, alternating between high and low registers. The second subject group consists of two alternating themes, the first of which features some of the melodic contours from the introduction. This is answered by a smoother and more consoling second theme, played by the strings and set in the subtonic key (A major) over a pedal point, before a more turbulent reappearance of the woodwind theme, this time re-enforced by driving piano arpeggios, gradually builds to a stormy climax in C minor that ends in a perfect cadence on the piano. After a short pause, a closing section, based on a variation of the consoling theme, closes the exposition in A major.Frivola- Walker 2010. The development section transforms this theme into an ominously building sequence, punctuated with snatches of the first subject material. After a flurry of piano octaves, fragments of the \\"plaintive\\" theme are revisited for the first time in E major, then for the second time in G minor, and then the piano and the strings take turns to play the theme for the third time in E major while the timpani furtively plays a tremolo on a low B until the first subject's fragments are continued. The recapitulation features an abridged version of the first subject, working around to C minor for the transition section. In the second subject group, the consoling second theme is omitted, and instead the first theme repeats, with a reappearance of the stormy climactic build that was previously heard in the exposition, but this time in B major. However, this time the excitement is cut short by a deceptive cadence. A brief closing section, made of G-flat major chords played by the whole orchestra and the piano, is heard. Then a piano cadenza appears, the second half of which contains subdued snatches of the second subject group's first theme in the work's original minor key. The B major is restored in the coda, when the orchestra re-enters with the second subject group's second theme; the tension then gradually builds up, leading to a triumphant conclusion, ending with a plagal cadence. Question of the introduction Introduction's theme, as played on the piano The introduction's theme is notable for its apparent formal independence from the rest of the movement and from the concerto as a whole, especially given its setting not in the work's nominal key of B minor but rather in D major, that key's relative major. Despite its very substantial nature, this theme is only heard twice, and it never reappears at any later point in the concerto.Steinberg, 477‚Äì478. Russian music historian Francis Maes writes that because of its independence from the rest of the work, > For a long time, the introduction posed an enigma to analysts and critics > alike. ... The key to the link between the introduction and what follows is > ... Tchaikovsky's gift of hiding motivic connections behind what appears to > be a flash of melodic inspiration. The opening melody comprises the most > important motivic core elements for the entire work, something that is not > immediately obvious, owing to its lyric quality. However, a closer analysis > shows that the themes of the three movements are subtly linked. Tchaikovsky > presents his structural material in a spontaneous, lyrical manner, yet with > a high degree of planning and calculation.See J. Norris, The Russian Piano > Concerto, 1:114‚Äì151. As cited in Maes, 76. Maes continues by mentioning that all the themes are tied together by a strong motivic link. These themes include the Ukrainian folk song \\"Oi, kriache, kriache, ta y chornenkyi voron ...\\" as the first theme of the first movement proper, the French chansonette, \\"Il faut s'amuser, danser et rire.\\" (Translated as: One must have fun, dance and laugh) in the middle section of the second movement and a Ukrainian vesnianka \\"Vyidy, vyidy, Ivanku\\" or greeting to spring which appears as the first theme of the finale; the second theme of the finale is motivically derived from the Russian folk song \\"Podoydi, podoydi vo Tsar-Gorod\\" and also shares this motivic bond. The relationship between them has often been ascribed to chance because they were all well-known songs at the time Tchaikovsky composed the concerto. It seems likely, though, that he used these songs precisely because of their motivic connection and used them where he felt necessary. \\"Selecting folkloristic material,\\" Maes writes, \\"went hand in hand with planning the large-scale structure of the work.\\"Maes, 76. All this is in line with the earlier analysis of the Concerto published by Tchaikovsky authority David Brown, who further suggests that Alexander Borodin's First Symphony may have given the composer both the idea to write such an introduction and to link the work motivically as he does. Brown also identifies a four-note musical phrase ciphered from Tchaikovsky's own name and a three-note phrase likewise taken from the name of soprano D√©sir√©e Art√¥t, to whom the composer had been engaged some years before.Brown, Crisis Years, 22‚Äì24. = II. Andantino semplice ‚Äì Prestissimo ‚Äì Tempo I = 2nd movement incipit The second movement, in D major, is written in time. The tempo marking of \\"andantino semplice\\" lends itself to a range of interpretations; the World War II-era recording of Vladimir Horowitz (as soloist) and Arturo Toscanini (as conductor) completed the movement in under six minutes, while towards the other extreme, Lang Lang recorded the movement, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Daniel Barenboim, in eight minutes. *Measures 1‚Äì58: Andantino semplice *Measures 59‚Äì145: Prestissimo *Measures 146‚Äì170: Tempo I After a brief pizzicato introduction, the flute carries the first statement of the theme. The flute's opening four notes are A‚ÄìE‚ÄìF‚ÄìA, while each other statement of this motif in the remainder of the movement substitutes the F for a (higher) B. The British pianist Stephen Hough suggests this may be an error in the published score, and that the flute should play a B. After the flute's opening statement of the melody, the piano continues and modulates to F major. After a bridge section, two cellos return with the theme in D major and the oboe continues it. The \\"A\\" section ends with the piano holding a high F major chord, pianissimo. The movement's \\"B\\" section is in D minor (the relative minor of F major) and marked \\"allegro vivace assai\\" or \\"prestissimo\\", depending on the edition. It commences with a virtuosic piano introduction before the piano assumes an accompanying role and the strings commence a new melody in D major. The \\"B\\" section ends with another virtuosic solo passage for the piano, leading into the return of the \\"A\\" section. In the return, the piano makes the first, now ornamented, statement of the theme. The oboe continues the theme, this time resolving it to the tonic (D major) and setting up a brief coda which finishes on another plagal cadence. = III. Allegro con fuoco ‚Äì Molto meno mosso ‚Äì Allegro vivo = 3rd movement incipit The final movement, in Rondo form, starts with a very brief introduction. The A theme, in B minor, is march-like and upbeat. This melody is played by the piano until the orchestra plays a variation of it . The B theme, in D major, is more lyrical and the melody is first played by the violins, and by the piano second. A set of descending scales leads to the abridged version of the A theme. The C theme is heard afterwards, modulating through various keys, containing dotted rhythm, and a piano solo leads to: The later measures of the A section are heard, and then the B appears, this time in E‚ô≠ major. Another set of descending scales leads to the A once more. However, this time, it ends with a half cadence on a secondary dominant, in which the coda starts. An urgent build-up leads to a sudden crash, build up with a F major two hands octaves as a transition point, to the last B‚ô≠ major melodie play along with the orchestra, and it fuses into a dramatic and extended climatic episode, gradually building up to a triumphant dominant prolongation. Then the melodies from the B theme is heard triumphantly in B major. After that, the final part of the coda, marked allegro vivo, draws the work to a conclusion on a perfect authentic cadence. History Tchaikovsky revised the concerto three times, the last being in 1888, which is the version usually now played. One of the most prominent differences between the original and final versions is that in the opening section, the octave chords played by the pianist, over which the orchestra plays the famous theme, were originally written as arpeggios. The work was also arranged for two pianos by Tchaikovsky, in December 1874; this edition was revised December 1888. =Disagreement with Rubinstein= There is some confusion regarding to whom the concerto was originally dedicated. It was long thought that Tchaikovsky initially dedicated the work to Nikolai Rubinstein, and Michael Steinberg writes that Rubinstein's name is crossed off the autograph score.Steinberg, 477. However, Brown writes that there is actually no truth in the assertion that the work was written to be dedicated to Rubinstein.Brown, Crisis Years, 18. Tchaikovsky did hope that Rubinstein would perform the work at one of the 1875 concerts of the Russian Musical Society in Moscow. For this reason he showed the work to him and another musical friend, Nikolai Hubert, at the Moscow Conservatory on December 24, 1874/January 5, 1875, just three days after finishing its composition.Brown, Crisis Years, 16‚Äî17. Brown writes, \\"This occasion has become one of the most notorious incidents in the composer's biography.\\"Brown, Crisis Years, 17. Three years later Tchaikovsky shared what happened with his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck: > I played the first movement. Not a single word, not a single remark! If you > knew how stupid and intolerable is the situation of a man who cooks and sets > before a friend a meal, which he proceeds to eat in silence! Oh, for one > word, for friendly attack, but for God's sake one word of sympathy, even if > not of praise. Rubinstein was amassing his storm, and Hubert was waiting to > see what would happen, and that there would be a reason for joining one side > or the other. Above all I did not want sentence on the artistic aspect. My > need was for remarks about the virtuoso piano technique. R's eloquent > silence was of the greatest significance. He seemed to be saying: \\"My > friend, how can I speak of detail when the whole thing is antipathetic?\\" I > fortified myself with patience and played through to the end. Still silence. > I stood up and asked, \\"Well?\\" Then a torrent poured from Nikolay > Grigoryevich's mouth, gentle at first, then more and more growing into the > sound of a Jupiter Tonans. It turned out that my concerto was worthless and > unplayable; passages were so fragmented, so clumsy, so badly written that > they were beyond rescue; the work itself was bad, vulgar; in places I had > stolen from other composers; only two or three pages were worth preserving; > the rest must be thrown away or completely rewritten. \\"Here, for instance, > this‚Äînow what's all that?\\" (he caricatured my music on the piano) \\"And this? > How can anyone ...\\" etc., etc. The chief thing I can't reproduce is the tone > in which all this was uttered. In a word, a disinterested person in the room > might have thought I was a maniac, a talented, senseless hack who had come > to submit his rubbish to an eminent musician. Having noted my obstinate > silence, Hubert was astonished and shocked that such a ticking off was being > given to a man who had already written a great deal and given a course in > free composition at the Conservatory, that such a contemptuous judgment > without appeal was pronounced over him, such a judgment as you would not > pronounce over a pupil with the slightest talent who had neglected some of > his tasks‚Äîthen he began to explain N.G.'s judgment, not disputing it in the > least but just softening that which His Excellency had expressed with too > little ceremony.

Tchaikovsky biographer John Warrack mentions that, even if Tchaikovsky were restating the facts in his favor, > it was, at the very least, tactless of Rubinstein not to see how much he > would upset the notoriously touchy Tchaikovsky. ... It has, moreover, been a > long-enduring habit for Russians, concerned about the role of their creative > work, to introduce the concept of 'correctness' as a major aesthetic > consideration, hence to submit to direction and criticism in a way > unfamiliar in the West, from Balakirev and Stasov organizing Tchaikovsky's > works according to plans of their own, to, in our own day, official > intervention and the willingness of even major composers to pay attention to > it.Warrack, 79. Warrack adds that Rubinstein's criticisms fell into three categories. First, he thought the writing of the solo part was bad, \\"and certainly there are passages which even the greatest virtuoso is glad to survive unscathed, and others in which elaborate difficulties are almost inaudible beneath the orchestra.\\"Warrack, 79‚Äì80. Second, he mentioned \\"outside influences and unevenness of invention ... but it must be conceded that the music is uneven and that [it] would, like all works, seem the more uneven on a first hearing before its style had been properly understood.\\"Warrack, 80. Third, the work probably sounded awkward to a conservative musician such as Rubinstein. While the introduction in the \\"wrong\\" key of D (for a composition supposed to be written in B minor) may have taken Rubinstein aback, Warrack explains, he may have been \\"precipitate in condemning the work on this account or for the formal structure of all that follows.\\" =Hans von B√ºlow= Brown writes that it is not known why Tchaikovsky next approached German pianist Hans von B√ºlow to premiere the work, although the composer had heard B√ºlow play in Moscow earlier in 1874 and had been taken with the pianist's combination of intellect and passion, and the pianist was likewise an admirer of Tchaikovsky's music.Steinberg, 476. B√ºlow was preparing to go on a tour of the United States. This meant that the concerto would be premiered half a world away from Moscow. Brown suggests that Rubinstein's comments may have deeply shaken him about the concerto, though he did not change the work and finished orchestrating it the following month, and that his confidence in the piece may have been so shaken that he wanted the public to hear it in a place where he would not have to personally endure any humiliation if it did not fare well. Tchaikovsky dedicated the work to B√ºlow, who described it as \\"so original and noble\\". The first performance of the original version took place on October 25, 1875, in Boston, conducted by Benjamin Johnson Lang and with B√ºlow as soloist. B√ºlow had initially engaged a different conductor, but they quarrelled, and Lang was brought in on short notice.Margaret Ruthven Lang & Family According to Alan Walker, the concerto was so popular that B√ºlow was obliged to repeat the Finale, a fact that Tchaikovsky found astonishing. Although the premiere was a success with the audience, the critics were not so impressed. One wrote that the concerto was \\"hardly destined ..to become classical\\".Naxos George Whitefield Chadwick, who was in the audience, recalled in a memoir years later: \\"They had not rehearsed much and the trombones got in wrong in the 'tutti' in the middle of the first movement, whereupon B√ºlow sang out in a perfectly audible voice, The brass may go to hell\\".Steven Ledbetter, notes for Colorado Symphony Orchestra However, the work fared much better at its performance in New York City on November 22, under Leopold Damrosch.Alan Walker (2009), p. 219 Benjamin Johnson Lang appeared as soloist in a complete performance of the concerto with the Boston Symphony Orchestra on February 20, 1885, under Wilhelm Gericke. Lang previously performed the first movement with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in March 1883, conducted by Georg Henschel, in a concert in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. The Russian premiere took place on November 1/13, 1875Tchaikovsky Research in Saint Petersburg, with the Russian pianist Gustav Kross and the Czech conductor Eduard N√°pravn√≠k. In Tchaikovsky's estimation, Kross reduced the work to \\"an atrocious cacophony\\".Alexander Poznansky, Tchaikovsky: The Quest for the Inner Man, p. 166 The Moscow premiere took place on November 21/December 3, 1875, with Sergei Taneyev as soloist. The conductor was none other than Nikolai Rubinstein, the same man who had comprehensively criticised the work less than a year earlier. Rubinstein had come to see its merits, and he played the solo part many times throughout Europe. He even insisted that Tchaikovsky entrust the premiere of his Second Piano Concerto to him, and the composer would have done so had Rubinstein not died. At that time, Tchaikovsky considered rededicating the work to Taneyev, who had performed it splendidly, but ultimately the dedication went to B√ºlow. Tchaikovsky published the work in its original form,Steinberg, 475. but in 1876 he happily accepted advice on improving the piano writing from German pianist Edward Dannreuther, who had given the London premiere of the work,Steinberg, 475‚Äî476. and from Russian pianist Alexander Siloti several years later. The solid chords played by the soloist at the opening of the concerto may in fact have been Siloti's idea, as they appear in the first (1875) edition as rolled chords, somewhat extended by the addition of one or sometimes two notes which made them more inconvenient to play but without significantly altering the sound of the passage. Various other slight simplifications were also incorporated into the published 1879 version. Further small revisions were undertaken for a new edition published in 1890. The American pianist Malcolm Frager unearthed and performed the original version of the concerto.All Music; Rogert Dettmer biography of Malcolm Frager. Retrieved 29 May 2014 In 2015, Kirill Gerstein made the world premiere recording of the 1879 version. It received an ECHO Klassik award in the Concerto Recording of the Year category. Based on Tchaikovsky's own conducting score from his last public concert, the new critical urtext edition was published in 2015 by the Tchaikovsky Museum in Klin, tying in with Tchaikovsky's 175th anniversary and marking 140 years since the concerto's world premiere in Boston in 1875. For the recording, Kirill Gerstein was granted special pre-publication access to the new urtext edition.BBC Music Magazine ‚Äì Artist Interview: Kirill Gerstein, February 2015 Notable performances * Theodore Thomas programmed the concerto for the first concerts of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, given on October 16 and 17, 1891.

The population taken at the 2011 Census was 9,182. History and growth Burscough developed originally as a small farming village on a low ridge above the West Lancashire Coastal Plain, and has Viking roots ‚Äì Burh-skogr = fortress in the woods. Of early importance to the village was Burscough Priory, the ruins of which stand to the southwest of the current settlement. The priory formerly housed the tombs of the Earls of Derby, a prominent family in the region, which are now to be found in Ormskirk parish church. With the building of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the coming of the railways in the mid-18th century new developments took place north of the original village, in what came to be called Burscough Bridge, though the two communities have long since melded together. For over a hundred years (from ) there was an Ordnance Depot on the eastern edge of Burscough, but this closed in 1996 and the site has been redeveloped into housing. With constant development of new housing estates and apartments, Burscough's population has recently grown rapidly. Further recent planned large developments at Yew Tree Farm, coupled with the long-term shortage of sewer capacity which causes widespread sewer flooding,Source: United Utilities 2015 AMP5 along with regular severe traffic congestion on the A59/A5209Source: Lancashire County Council resulted in a parish poll being called by residents, in which more than 96% of the voters opposed the additional development on greenbelt farmland. At the 2011 Census, the population of the parish stood at 9,182. RNAS Burscough (HMS Ringtail) There was an operational Fleet Air Arm air station, RNAS Burscough (HMS Ringtail), southwest of the town. It was active between September 1943 and May 1946. Community =Schools= Burscough has a number of primary schools: *Lordsgate Township C of E *St. John's Church of England *Burscough Village (formerly Colburne Close Primary) *Burscough Bridge Methodist *St. John's Roman Catholic There is also a secondary school, Burscough Priory Academy (formerly Burscough Priory High School and Burscough Priory Science College) and also a small public library. =Retail and commercial= Shopping in the town is provided for by a large Tesco supermarket, a Booths, an Aldi and some other smaller shops including a Spar, as well as local florists, barber. Burscough Wharf provides a space for small independent businesses, alongside the artisan market. Burscough Wharf On 12 February 2011, a small retail and leisure development known as Burscough Wharf opened its doors to the public. Situated on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, next to the southern bridge of the town centre, the development consists of approximately thirty units available for retail, leisure or office/studio space. Current businesses operating within the central square of Burscough Wharf consist of an instrumental music school, various independent gift shops, food and drink outlets, including a burger restaurant, gin bar and tea room, and health and beauty salons, and a fortnightly artisan market has been established. =Churches= Burscough has three churches: St John the Baptist Church, St John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church and Burscough Methodist Church. Transport Burscough Bridge railway station The A59 trunk road and Leeds and Liverpool Canal pass through Burscough and the A5209 brings large volumes of traffic through the town from where it connects to the A59. Lancashire County Council describe the town as suffering from \\"severe congestion\\". The canal junction with the Rufford Branch of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal is in Burscough. The town has two main railway stations: Burscough Junction, on the Liverpool to Preston line, was opened by the East Lancashire Railway on 2 April 1849, though the line now terminates at Ormskirk. Burscough Bridge, on the Southport to Manchester line, was opened by the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway on 9 April 1855. There is also a third station two miles from the centre in New Lane, which is a small halt on the same line as Burscough Bridge. These lines formerly had a junction known as the Burscough curves. The deletion of the curves prevents through train services between Ormskirk and Southport and Southport and Preston. The presence of the two stations is a sign of the two previous villages and their differing landowners. The Burscough Junction Station Crash occurred on 15 January 1880 on the Liverpool to Preston railway line. =Victor Electrics= Burscough Bridge was the home of Victor Electrics, a manufacturer of battery electric road vehicle, including bread vans and milk floats. The company was formed by Outram's bakery of Southport, who could not find electric vehicles at a price they were prepared to pay, and so decided to build their own. The first bread van was produced in 1923, and proved so successful that several more were built. By 1927, the company looked at the possibility of allowing another company, who were already involved in electric vehicle production, to take over the enterprise, but they decided to retain control of the facility. The company was based on Victoria Street, just to the north of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, where there was a bakery shown on maps from 1928,Ordnance Survey, 1:25,000 map, 1928 and engineering works on the 1972 map.Ordnance Survey, 1:25,000 map, 1972 Initial models looked like a conventional van, with a bonnet at the front, which housed the batteries, but they made their first forward control model in 1931, and switched completely to this design, which became ubiquitous for milk floats, in 1935. Although they set up another company, Ross Auto Engineering, to manufacture battery electric vehicles in 1949, production of their own models continued at Burscough Bridge. They were taken over by Brook Motors, becoming Brook Victor Electric Vehicles in 1967. Acquired by Hawker Siddeley in 1970, they became Brook Crompton Parkinson Motors in 1973. One Victor milk float still exists. It is a B20 model dating from around 1955, and is currently awaiting restoration at the Transport Museum, Wythall, to the south of Birmingham. =Windmill Farm Railway= The Windmill Farm Railway is a narrow gauge railway line located at the Windmill Animal Farm. The railway operates over a track at gauge, using locomotives previously from the Fairbourne Railway, since that line has regauged to a smaller gauge. Sport and leisure =Burscough F.C.= Burscough F.C. play at Victoria Park. They won the FA Trophy in 2003 when they defeated conference side Tamworth in the final at Villa Park. In the 2005-06 FA Cup competition they beat league side Gillingham 3‚Äì2 at home in the first round. After winning the Northern Premier League in 2007, they were then relegated from the Conference North to the NPL Premier Division in the 2008‚Äì09 season. A further relegation followed and the club now play in the NPL Division 1 (North). =Allotment society= Although the allotments in Burscough have been used since the construction of the Richmond Avenue housing estate, the need for a formal society was identified by the Parish Council in order to obtain further land for allotments in Burscough. Following a series of meetings a society was formed and the constitution agreed during a meeting on 23 November 2011.http://burscoughallotmentsociety.weebly.com/index.html =Fishing= There is a fishery in the town at Warper's Moss Lane, which has four-man-made lakes stocked with a wide variety of coarse fish including carp to around .

The term has its origin in Britain's Royal Navy after its use of Diamond Rock, off Martinique, as a 'sloop of war' to harass the French. (The Royal Navy was prohibited from ruling over land, so the land was commissioned as a ship.) The command of this first stone frigate was given to Commodore Hood's first lieutenant, James Wilkes Maurice, who, with cannon taken off the Commodore's ship, manned it with a crew of 120 until its capture by the French in the Battle of Diamond Rock in 1805. Until the late 19th century, the Royal Navy housed training and other support facilities in hulks‚Äîold wooden ships of the line‚Äîmoored in ports as receiving ships, depot ships, or floating barracks. The Admiralty regarded shore accommodation as expensive and liable to lead to indiscipline. These floating establishments kept their names while the actual vessels housing them changed. For example, the gunnery training school at Portsmouth occupied three ships between its foundation in 1830 and its move ashore in 1891 but all were named (or renamed) HMS Excellent. As ships began to use increasingly complex technology during the late 19th century, these facilities became too large to continue afloat and were moved to shore establishments while keeping their names. An early \\"stone frigate\\" was the engineering training college HMS Marlborough, moved ashore to Portsmouth in 1880. The gunnery school continued to be named HMS Excellent after its move ashore to Whale Island in 1891. By World War I there were about 25 \\"stone frigates\\" in the United Kingdom. Under section 87 of the Naval Discipline Act 1866, the provisions of the act only applied to officers and men of the Royal Navy borne on the books of a warship. When shore establishments began to become more common it was necessary to allocate the title of the establishment to an actual vessel which became the nominal depot ship for the men allocated to the establishment and thus ensured they were subject to the provisions of the Act. The use of stone frigates continues in the Royal Navy and some other navies of the Commonwealth of Nations, including the Royal Canadian Navy, the Indian Navy, the Royal Australian Navy, and the Royal New Zealand Navy.

Richard had likely been executed in the Tower of London several years before, but there remained widespread support for his family in Ireland. His impersonation enjoyed great success for several years and travelled across Europe securing recognition from various monarchs.

He is generally credited for coining the terms 'Blast beat' and 'Grindcore' to describe his ferocious drumming attack and the genre he helped create and popularize. Since the mid-1990s, Harris has worked primarily in electronic and ambient music, his main projects being Scorn and Lull. According to Allmusic, Harris's \\"genre-spanning activities have done much to jar the minds, expectations, and record collections of audiences previously kept aggressively opposed.\\" Beginnings and Napalm Death Harris was born in Birmingham, and started out in the 1980s as a drummer working with various punk rock and grindcore bands (most notably pioneering grindcore band Napalm Death). As a drummer he is generally credited with popularising the blast beat, which has since become a key component of much of extreme metal and grindcore. Harris' recording debut was as Napalm Death's second drummer, joining after founding member Miles \\"The Rat\\" Ratledge left the band in November 1985. His first live appearance with the band was on 18 January 1986, opening for Amebix. Harris was the driving force behind the band's seminal Scum album and the second release From Enslavement to Obliteration. A subsequent review of From Enslavement to Obliteration in the punk/indie fanzine Flipside went as follows: \\"This sounds like someone is literally firing a fully automatic rifle while a bassist and guitarist try to keep up.\\" After the release of the EP Mentally Murdered, Napalm Death became more interested in the death metal scene and their sound started to move away from the British grindcore sound. At this point Bill Steer and Lee Dorrian departed the band due to creative differences, later, Harris was the sole band member who remained in the tumultuous group through many line-up changes, eventually leaving in May 1991, just after the tour for Harmony Corruption. While in Napalm Death, Harris also played drums for Doom and Extreme Noise Terror, and participated in a side project with Mitch Harris called Defecation, which produced two records, Purity Dilution and Intention Surpassed, through Nuclear Blast. Harris contributed only to Purity Dilution. Post Napalm Death =Scorn= After leaving Napalm Death, Harris founded Scorn with Napalm Death's original bassist/lead singer Nic Bullen. Scorn released several well-received albums and EPs in the early 1990s, creating a unique fusion of experimental heavy metal, electronic music, and dark dub music. Bullen left Scorn in 1995, but Harris continued to release albums under the Scorn moniker, exploring dark and minimalist industrial hip-hop territory, with a focus on extremely low and loud bass frequencies. Harris' work presaged the grittier aspects of the dubstep craze of the mid-2000s. As with the tendency for people to put a name to anything, Scorn has also been referred to as beginning the 'Dark-Hop' sound. After two albums in this style still on Earache Records who didn't quite seem to know what to do with this new sound, Scorn and Earache parted ways, leading to a somewhat nomadic existence since then. Scorn has been associated with KK Records, Invisible Records, Hymen and most recently seminal US drum and bass label OHM Resistance, to which Harris had earlier ties to with other projects. In 2007, Ohm Resistance released the first album of all new material in 5 years in a smattering of 12\\" have also been in the works of late on labels such as the UK's Combat Records and Record Label Records in the US. 25 May 2010 has seen the release of the newest album under the Scorn moniker, Refuse; Start Fires, again through OHM Resistance. This newest Scorn is the first studio release since the Bullen-era to feature another player on many of the tracks, with Harris incorporating a live drummer. In November 2011, Harris announced that the Scorn project was \\"put to bed\\". Scorn returned in 2019 with an EP entitled ‚ÄòFeather‚Äô released by Ohm Resistance. =Lull= Somewhat concurrent with Scorn, Harris began Lull, a beatless dark ambient project. Though not as prolific or popular as Scorn, one can argue that this project in its own way is just as influential. Lull was at the front of the so-called Isolationist movement that also included people such as Thomas K√∂ner. Under this moniker, Harris has released full lengths on Sentrax and Release Entertainment (part of Relapse) as well as various 7\\" releases and compilation tracks, most of which were collected and re-issued on CD by the late Manifold Records. After a number of years of inactivity, Lull has returned with a remix for Franziska Baumann on Soleilmoon Recordings, contributions for the 3-CD compilation Nekton Falls on Celestial Dragon and Fabriksampler V2 on Pharmafabrik, and the CD Like a Slow River on Glacial Movement Records. No albums were released since 2008. =Painkiller= Also around the same time as Harris leaving Napalm Death, he was contacted by John Zorn who wanted to create a new group consisting of Zorn, Harris and Bill Laswell on bass. This trio became Painkiller ‚Äì a free jazz-extreme metal trio. The group released 3 successful albums in the early to mid nineties. Guts of a Virgin and Buried Secrets were released by Earache Records and contained mostly short aggressive tracks reminiscent of Napalm Death at times, but with the added elements of both John Zorn's sax and Bill Laswell's bass and all the history the two had behind them. 1995 saw the third (and last proper) release, the two disc set Execution Ground (also released in Japan on Toy's Factory with a third, live disc), on the Subharmonic label. This release saw the trio spread out in three long tracks that retained some of the aggressiveness of the earlier albums, but added a much more spacious, dubby and (at times) ambient feel to the recordings, arguably much influenced by Laswell's production work at the time. The second disc contained ambient re-workings of two of the tracks. In the years since, some live recordings have been released and the trio tends to play a few shows a year, but since the later half of the '90s, different drummers have been behind the kit as Harris stopped drumming live. After rumours of the original trio reforming cropping up in recent years (particularly in light of Harris' recent gigs with the group Black Engine), The original trio did indeed play one last gig in France on 23 June 2008. The show also featured Mike Patton and Fred Frith as guests. At the current time, there are no plans for any more gigs by the group in any form using that moniker. =Quoit and Hed Nod= In addition to the projects he is most well known for, two other monikers make occasional appearances. Quoit is a name used for a drum n bass project that has released three full-lengths, assorted 12\\"s, a 7\\" and the occasional remix. Hed Nod is the name for a series of beat and bass releases tangentially related to the Scorn sound, but in a lighter vein. A series of coloured 12\\" releases were put out on the Disques HushHush sub-label Hed Nod. Buying into the series in advance also got subscribers a CD of extra HedNod tracks not found on the vinyl releases. In 2005, all of the Hed Nod sessions were released on one double disc set called (logically) the Hednod Sessions. Though inactive as a project since the initial 12\\" releases, the project sees the possibility of reactivation in the near future if conditions are right. =Fret= In 2017, Mick Harris returned after six years of total silence under the name of 'Fret' with a new song called \\"Lift Method\\" that was released through Soundcloud. It was his first Fret material in 22 years. A new album called Over Depth was released in October 2017 as double vinyl / DL through Karlrecords. =Possible Recs.= In the mid-1990s, Harris started his own record label, called Possible Recs., which leaned towards a drum & bass sound with some exceptions. The short lived label released a batch of 12\\"s from PCM, Ambush, Quoit, Scorn, James Plotkin's Jupiter project and Eraldo Bernocchi's Interceptor and SIMM projects. Additionally, the label released full-length albums in both CD and 2x12\\" format by Quoit and SIMM. Other collaborations Along with these (mostly) Harris-helmed projects, many remixes and other random collaborations have appeared through the years. Harris has released and/or produced albums with/by Mark Spybey, Submerged, Bill Laswell, Eraldo Bernocchi, Neil Harvey, Martyn Bates, Sielwolf and a host of others. He's also done extensive remix work for Almamegretta, Sielwolf, PSI Performer (Anthony Rother), TMK, Franciszka Baumann, Pigface, Meat Beat Manifesto, Ambre and a host of others. Live performances generally under his Scorn moniker have been a constant through the years.

When Manos was 10 years old, his family moved from Crete to Athens, where his father searched for work. His brother, Giannis, emigrated to North America. Manos played soccer during his youth for the Athinaikos football team and others. Along with actor/director Kostas Leloudas, he acted in his first movie To Lavaro tou '21 in 1928. He later performed in the Ethniko Theatro (the National Theatre) in 1931. During the 1930s, he continued acting in theatrical plays (he was friends with the maestro Dimitris Mitropoulos). He married Anna Lori in 1943. He took part in the resistance as a member of EAM/ELAS and after refusing to sign a declaration of repentance during the Greek Civil War of 1946‚Äì49, he was exiled to Makronisos, along with such other well-known figures as Yiannis Ritsos, Nikos Koundouros, Mikis Theodorakis and Thanasis Veggos. In the 1950s he returned to Athens from Makronisos but there was little acting work. He was handed both small and big roles in plays and films. In 1954, he married his third and last wife named Linda Alma (real name Eleni Malioufa). Shortly before his death, he filmed his last and best movie Taxidi sta Kythira, the Journey to Kythera/Kythira, with director Theo Angelopoulos.

In medieval times it was a thriving borough. According to the Post Office the 2011 Census population of the hamlet was included in the civil parish of Calbourne. Newtown is located on the large natural harbour on the island's north-western coast, now mostly a national nature reserve owned and managed by the National Trust. The Caul Bourne streams through Calbourne, passes Newbridge and Shalfleet and empties into the Solent at Newtown. History Town Hall View over the marshes, with Newtown church on the skyline The harbour; looking north with the mainland in the far distance The town was originally called Francheville (i.e. 'Freetown'), and only later renamed Newtown. It was probably founded before the Norman Conquest. There is some indication that it was attacked by Danes in 1001. The earliest known charter was granted by the Bishop-elect of Winchester, Aymer de Valence. He signed it at his ecclesiastical estate of Swainston Manor in 1256. The early hopes for its success are reflected in the names of its streets, such as Gold Street and Silver Street. However, it will have had competition from Yarmouth, Newport and Southampton. In 1284 it was somewhat reluctantly given to Edward I. Apparently there were about 60 families living in Newtown at the start of the 14th century. By the mid 14th century, Newtown was starting to mature into a thriving commercial centre. In 1344, it was assessed at twice the value of Newport. Its harbour was busy and reputed to be the safest on the island. There was a prosperous saltworks and abundant oyster beds. There was an annual three-day festival on the \\"eve, the day and the morrow of the Feast of St. Mary Magdalen\\", who was honoured in the name of the local thirteenth-century chapel. Then, the great plague struck, and subsequently a French raid in 1377 destroyed much of the town, from which it never truly recovered. By the middle of the 16th century, it was a small settlement eclipsed by the more easily defended town of Newport. A survey in 1559 noted that Newtown no longer had a market, and did not have a single good house still standing. Its harbour slowly became clogged with silt and inaccessible to larger vessels. In 1584 Elizabeth I breathed some life into the town by awarding it two parliamentary seats. A town hall was built in the 17th century. However, these seats ultimately made Newtown borough one of the most notorious of the rotten boroughs, prevalent in the UK before the 19th century reforms. By the time of the 1832 Reform Act that abolished the seats, a survey found that Newtown had just fourteen houses and twenty-three voters, whilst massively larger municipal areas with many more voters had less representation. The town hall was restored in 1813, and again in the 1930s. It is now open to the public. The Newtown Arms Inn was closed in 1916. It was in an unusually shaped building referred to locally as \\"Noah's Ark.\\" Newtown remained small, but this has preserved its original layout, which is of historical interest. There are two square ponds by the boathouse, which were dug as salterns as part of the former local salt industry. The harbour and salterns have since become a habitat for fish native to the Isle of Wight and its surrounding waters, with large populations of Flathead grey mullet living in both the harbour and the salterns. Although there are a number of private residences still in use and the harbour is still accessible and used by small to medium vessels, Much of the land Newtown is situated on is now under the ownership of the National Trust, with the hamlet being at the centre of a nature reserve built around the old harbour. Newtown is popular with tourists and birdwatchers, as numerous uncommon native species use the salt marshes to nest. Legend There are stories of a pied piper, hired for 50 pounds to save Newtown from an excess of rats, which are similar to the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, Germany. He is said to have played his pipe and led the rats into the Solent, where they drowned. The townspeople refused to pay the agreed price, and gave the piper 20 pounds, so he then led the children away. The town lost an entire generation, so had no young people to defend it when the French attacked in 1377. Transport Southern Vectis operates an infrequent bus route 35, Newbridge to Newport, via Newtown, Porchfield and Marks Corner.

He was a fan of the band before he joined, first seeing them perform at Midlands venue The Mermaid the previous year and becoming close friends of the members of the band, particularly Mick Harris. Nicholas Bullen, the founding member of the band, originally asked Shane to join them before the recording of the B-side of the debut album Scum but Shane eventually declined due to nervousness, his biggest regret. =Warhammer= Before joining Napalm Death, Embury played drums in a death metal band called Warhammer with Mitch Dickinson. The band released one demo in 1985 called Abattoir of Death. After Warhammer, Embury and Mitch did work as Unseen Terror. Embury also played drums in Azagthoth with fellow Warhammer guitarist Wayne Aston and bassist Pete Giles. Azagthoth recorded one demo at Rich Bitch Studios in Birmingham called Shredded Flesh. =Other projects= Embury has a long list of side projects. He performed in the grindcore band Unseen Terror with Mitch Dickinson, who was also a member of Heresy.

F1 moved to Zolder in 1973 and with the exception of a race at Nivelles-Baulers in 1974, Zolder was the location of the Belgian Grand Prix until 1982. That year, Canadian driver Gilles Villeneuve was killed during qualifying at the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix. Villeneuve's Ferrari 126C2 collided at speed with the March of Jochen Mass. The Ferrari was torn up in the accident and when rolling, Villeneuve was thrown from the car. After Villeneuve's death, the Belgian Grand Prix was held at Spa-Francorchamps in 1983, before returning to Zolder one final time in 1984. Fittingly, Ferrari driver Michele Alboreto won the race carrying Villeneuve's #27 on his car. Since , the Belgian Grand Prix has permanently moved to Spa. Zolder has also been used for cycling events including the UCI Road World Championships twice in 1969 and 2002 and the UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships in 1970, 2002 and 2016. The latter saw the first confirmed use of mechanical doping when Femke Van den Driessche was found to have a secret motor inside her bike. Since 2009, Circuit Zolder has hosted a cyclo-cross race in December for the World Cup. The circuit hosted the UCI BMX World Championships in 2015. In 2019 and for the first time ever the UCI BMX World Championships will return to Circuit Zolder. In the beginning of 2006, the track underwent safety adaptations. In 2007, the track hosted a Champ Car World Series Grand Prix, and a round of the FIA GT Championship. The track was venue of a round of the World Series by Renault championship from 2003 to 2006, and replaced Zandvoort as site for the Masters of Formula 3 in 2007 and 2008. Zolder was featured on the car programme Top Gear in 2008. In the episode, the show's British hosts competed against their German counterparts from D MOTOR. Zolder hosted also the FIA WTCC Race of Belgium in 2010 and 2011. The last race they drove in 2011 was won by Rob Huff in a Chevrolet and Gabriele Tarquini in a SEAT. The WTCC then disappeared from the Belgian circuits until in 2014 the circus returned to Spa. At this time, mainly the Blancpain Sprint Series and the BRCC national championship hosted a race in Zolder. The 24 Hours of Zolder endurance event is also held as a stand-alone event around the end of August or the beginning of September. NASCAR Whelen Euro Series have hosted their final race of the season in Zolder since 2015. In 2019, for the first time in 17 years, the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters returned to Circuit Zolder.

Mackenzie was also an accomplished man of letters, producing several volumes of travel writing and biographies of early important US naval figures, some of whom he knew personally. Mackenzie was the brother of Senator John Slidell of Louisiana, who was later involved in the American Civil War's Trent Affair. Mackenzie was the captain of USS Somers when it became the only US Navy ship to undergo a mutiny, which led to executions, including Philip Spencer, the 19-year-old son of the Secretary of War John C. Spencer. Mackenzie's handling of the Somers Mutiny, including its lack of a lawful court martial, was highly controversial and public opinion ran against him. The mutiny proved the need for systematic training of cadets before they went to sea. In 1845, Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft seized on the Somers affair as a reason to establish the United States Naval Academy. Family Mackenzie (then Slidell) was born April 6, 1803, in New York City, to Margery [also spelled Marjorie] (Mackenzie) and John Slidell. Alexander was one of a large family of children. His older siblings included Thomas Slidell (later chief justice of Louisiana's state supreme court), John Slidell (later US Senator from Louisiana), and Jane Slidell (later the wife of Commodore Matthew C. Perry). Jane's marriage to M. C. Perry was to have a particularly profound influence on her younger brother's life, bringing him into close contact with one of the nation's leading naval families, which included Matthew's heroic older brother, Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, and members of Commodore John Rodgers' family, with whom the Perrys intermarried. In 1837‚Äì1838, Alexander Slidell petitioned the New York State legislature and obtained the right to change his name to Mackenzie, reputedly as a condition of claiming the inheritance of a maternal uncle. Mackenzie was the father of General Ranald Slidell Mackenzie, who, after a successful Civil War career, commanded the 4th Cavalry Regiment (United States), securing the line of settlement in Texas and throughout the West. Ranald Mackenzie was arguably the best Indian fighter of the American West. Another son was Lieutenant Commander Alexander Slidell MacKenzie. Naval service Mackenzie entered the U.S. Navy as a midshipman in 1815. A contemporary of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and a personal friend of Washington Irving, he published a number of books, including A Year in Spain, Life of John Paul Jones, Life of Commodore Stephen Decatur, and Life of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry (his late brother-in-law). He was promoted to lieutenant on January 13, 1825, and to commander on September 8, 1841. was launched by the New York Navy Yard on April 16, 1842, and was commissioned on 12 May 1842, with Mackenzie in command. After completing a shakedown cruise to Puerto Rico and back, the new brig sailed out of New York Harbor on September 13, 1842, with orders to head for the Atlantic coast of Africa with dispatches for the sloop . Somers was also acting as an experimental schoolship for naval apprentices on this voyage; the Somers crew was mostly inexperienced sailors and seamen. After looking for Vandalia at Madeira, Tenerife, and Porto Praia, Somers arrived at Monrovia, Liberia, on November 10, only to discover that the sloop had already sailed for home. The next day, Mackenzie set sail for the Virgin Islands hoping to meet up with Vandalia at St. Thomas before the return journey back to New York. Somers mutiny On the passage to West Africa, some of the Somers officers noticed a steady worsening of morale among the crew. On the way home on November 26, 1842 Mackenzie leaned of the plot and arrested Midshipman Philip Spencer, the 19-year old son of Secretary of War John Canfield Spencer, for inciting mutiny. The other two young plotters arrested with Spencer were Elisha Small and Samuel Cromwell. Mackenzie was not legally empowered to convene a court martial. So he charged his officers with making an investigation. They unanimously concluded that the three sailors were guilty and recommended their immediate execution, which took place at sea on December 1, 1842. Only 13 days later, Somers arrived in New York, where a naval court of inquiry was immediately ordered to investigate the affair.Samuel Eliot Morison, \\"Old Bruin\\": Commodore Matthew C. Perry, 1794-1858 (1967) pp 144-62.Buckner, Melton,A Hanging Offense: The Strange Affair of the Warship Somers (Simon and Schuster, 2007), a scholarly study that; compares the conspiracy to modern-day school shootings. Mackenzie was completely exonerated at the court of inquiry and at a subsequent court martial. However the controversial incident drew nationwide attention and colored the remainder of his life. It was customary then to commend officers cleared at a court martial, but Mackenzie's court martial made very clear that it was not commending him. The entire affair resulted in a great sensation, and Mackenzie's conduct was as severely criticized by his opponents as it was ardently defended by his supporters. His fiercest detractor was the famous novelist and naval historian James Fenimore Cooper. Naval historian and author Mackenzie was also an accomplished author and naval historian. While his tours of duty in the navy were broadening, he also used several extended leaves to travel in Europe, where he mingled with other literary Americans including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and fellow New Yorker Washington Irving, a lifelong friend. Mackenzie's first work, A Year in Spain, by a Young American (1829), made him known in America as well as in England. Other works followed: Popular Essays on Naval Subjects (1833), The American in England (1835), Spain Revisited (1836), Life of John Paul Jones (1841), Life of Commodore Oliver H. Perry (1841), and Life of Commodore Stephen Decatur (1846). Mackenzie also wrote a manuscript, A Journal of a Tour in Ireland, The Case of the 'Seiners'; \\"Defence of A. S. Mackenzie\\", 1843. Death According to a letter written by Captain D.W. Knox, USN (ret.) on July 1, 1938, in response to a query to the Department of the Navy, \\"Commander MacKenzie died suddenly September 13, 1848, at his residence, near Tarrytown, N.Y., of heart disease.

They developed a Proven√ßal hybrid version of reggae, rub-a-dub and raggamuffin with lyrics in the French and Occitan languages, sometimes referred to as trobamuffin (from the Occitan word trobador and the musical style raggamuffin), though they have also performed in Portuguese and Italian. They incorporate many rhythms, beats and samples from the local tradition or other musical colleagues, and their lyrics indicate a profound parochialism for Marseille and the south of France in general. Massilia Sound System re-popularised the city of Marseille in the 1990s, in conjunction with the success of Olympique de Marseille, the local soccer club. Along with that empowered an entire generation of young Marseillais with a positive identity, proud of their city and their capacity to embrace different cultural traditions. Intra-regional links were formed with other groups, such as Claude Sicre's Fabulous Trobadors in Toulouse, Les Nux Vomica in Nice, and other reggae/ragga groups using the culture and language of the region. Their recent albums incorporate more rock sounds, with deepening explorations into world music, such as the use of tabla, and make further incursions into drum and bass and hip-hop.

The 2008‚Äì12 Accords took this a step further, allowing the engine to go from 6 cylinders, down to 4, and further down to 3 as the computer sees fit. Unlike the pushrod systems used by DaimlerChrysler's Multi- Displacement System and General Motors' Active Fuel Management, Honda's VCM uses overhead cams. A solenoid unlocks the cam followers on one bank from their respective rockers, so the cam follower floats freely while the valve springs keep the valves closed. The engine's drive by wire throttle allows the engine management computer to smooth out the engine's power delivery, making the system nearly imperceptible on some vehicles. When the VCM system disables cylinders, an \\"ECO\\" indicator lights on the dashboard, Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) pumps an opposite-phase sound through the audio speakers to reduce cabin noise, and Active Control Engine Mount (ACM) systems reduce vibration. Owners of vehicles equipped with VCM frequently face vibration problems due to engine motor mount malfunction while ECO mode is enabled. Instead of replacing motor mounts, owners often override the VCM with a bypass mechanism, such as an in-line resistor based temperature override module. This has the effect of the vehicle computer believing that a sufficient engine temperature to enable VCM has not been reached. While this cannot guarantee that VCM will be disabled (eg. differing climates/load scenarios), it can generally keep VCM from engaging under normal driving conditions.

Halifax Peninsula is home to Downtown Halifax, the financial and economic heart of the municipality, which was also the site of the original settlement and town of Halifax. The town of Halifax was founded by the British government under the direction of the Board of Trade and Plantations under the command of Governor Edward Cornwallis in 1749. Geographically, the Halifax Peninsula is a Canadian peninsula in central Nova Scotia. History Although now located entirely within HRM, the peninsula was the original host to the town and now former City of Halifax. The founding of the town sparked Father Le Loutre's War. The original settlement was clustered in the southeastern part of the peninsula along The Narrows, between a series of forts (Fort Needham to the north, Fort George (Citadel Hill) in the middle, and Fort Massey to the south) and the harbour. The settlement expanded beyond its walls and gradually encroached over the entire peninsula, creating residential neighbourhoods defined by the peninsula's geography (in addition to the central business district) and referred to by Haligonians as: * North End * South End, including Point Pleasant Park at the southernmost part of the peninsula * West End The streets are set in a grid pattern the way town officials originally planned in the 18th century. Art Gallery of Nova Scotia (former Halifax Federal Building) by George Lang (builder) After a protracted struggle between residents and the Executive Council, the city was incorporated to in 1841. The former city of Halifax was contained entirely within the Halifax Peninsula; however in 1969, municipal amalgamation saw adjacent rural areas of Halifax County west of the isthmus amalgamated into the city, including Rockingham and Spryfield. During this time, Rudyard Kipling paid homage to Halifax in his poem The Song of Cities: At this time the Halifax Public Gardens and Victoria Park, Halifax were created, with many Victorian Era monuments. Builders such as George Lang created many landmark buildings. During 1916‚Äì1919 a mega construction project was undertaken by Canadian Government Railways (later Canadian National Railway) along the peninsula's Northwest Arm shoreline which saw a 4 km long rock cut blasted up to 30 m deep for a railway line running from Fairview Cove to serve the new Halifax Ocean Terminals which were built at the southeastern end; the rock from blasting work in the cut being used as infill for a portion of The Narrows. On 1 April 1996, the government of Nova Scotia formed Halifax Regional Municipality, a single-tier regional government governing all of Halifax County. The City of Halifax became a provincial metropolitan area, and the HRM divided the former city into two separate community planning areas, Halifax Peninsula and Mainland Halifax, and at that time with separate community councils inside of the regional government. Geography Halifax Harbour from the air looking South including the Halifax Peninsula at upper right Extending from the western shore of Halifax Harbour, the peninsula is connected to the much larger Chebucto Peninsula by an isthmus measuring 2.6 km, defined by Fairview Cove and the Bedford Basin to the north and the Northwest Arm to the southwest. Down the length of this isthmus is Joseph Howe Drive, generally considered to be the boundary between the Halifax Peninsula and Mainland Halifax. The Halifax Peninsula creates The Narrows, a constriction of Halifax Harbour to its east. Measuring 3.3 km at its widest and 7.5 km at its longest, the peninsula's topography is relatively flat near the isthmus where Chebucto Field, an aerodrome that preceded Halifax Stanfield International Airport was located. The northern end of the peninsula rises to a glacial drumlin at Fort Needham (approx. 60 m above sea level), with the central area of the peninsula being a plateau roughly 40‚Äì50 m. in elevation. Another drumlin approx. 60 m above sea level is located at Citadel Hill and immediately offshore to the east at Georges Island. The bedrock of this peninsula is Precambrian slate. Glaciers during the Pleistocene era converted the rock surface to an olive-colored loamy till. Glaciation also removed reddish till from sedimentary rock to the north and redeposited it as a drumlin to form Citadel Hill. The stony loam to sandy loam soils are mapped as Bridgewater series on olive till and Wolfville series on the Citadel Hill drumlin.http://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/publications/surveys/ns/ns13b/Soil Survey of Halifax County Nova Scotia Present-day neighbourhoods Oxford Theatre, on Quinpool Road in the peninsula's West End =Colloquial neighbourhoods= * Downtown Halifax * North End Halifax * West End, Halifax * Quinpool district * South End Halifax * Spring Garden =Electoral Districts= * Halifax Chebucto * Halifax Citadel-Sable Island * Halifax Needham =Historic neighbourhoods= * Africville * Richmond =Other neighbourhoods= (subdivisions and housing development names) * Convoy Place * Hydrostone * Mulgrave Park * Westmount References Landforms of Halifax, Nova Scotia Peninsulas of Nova Scotia Landforms of Halifax County, Nova Scotia ","title":"Halifax Peninsula"},{"id":"1359269","text":"Hatchettite (also mountain tallow, mineral tallow, mineral adipocire, or adipocerite) is a mineral hydrocarbon.

His coat of arms was ≈öwinka. Life Little is known about the early life of Jakub ≈öwinka, nor are his parents known. It is thought he came from a pagan family and his grandmother was a herbalist, which inevitably at that time included elements of paganism.P≈Çomienna korona ≈öwinka was a descendant of a noble family from Greater Poland or Silesia coa ≈öwinka. His family started a career in Greater Poland, but with a limited success. It is known that his elder brother Su≈Çek did not hold any official posts while his uncle Jan ≈öwinka was mentioned in 1286 as the castellan of a town of Spycimierz. Jakub ≈öwinka probably joined the Catholic priesthood and it is also probable that he graduated from a law school ‚Äì probably in Cracow (Krak√≥w) or Prague. In the 1270s he was promoted to the post of a cantor of the chapter in Gniezno. For his service to the Dukes of Greater Poland, most notably to Boleslaus the Pious and to Przemys≈Ç II he was awarded, on 8 January 1294, with the village of Polanowo. ≈öwinka was consecrated as archbishop in Kalisz on 30 July 1283 and the results of the voting were accepted by Pope Martin IV on 19 December the same year. The election of a Polish archbishop was seen by the rulers of Greater Poland as a chance to break the links with the Holy Roman Empire, and on 1 August 1284 Duke Przemys≈Ç II granted the bishops of Gniezno with a privilege to mint their own coins. This strengthened their power significantly. From the earliest days of his reign, ≈öwinka faced a strong opposition to his rule. The most important issues were the problem of the diocese of W≈Çoc≈Çawek (to which belonged both the cities of S≈Çupsk and Gda≈Ñsk) that was claimed both by the Polish bishop of Gniezno and the German bishops of Merseburg, and the struggle for dominance over the Catholics in Poland between Polish and German hierarchs. The latter problem was seen as the most important, since several monasteries in Lower Silesia decided to break the links with its Polish-Bohemian province and apply for membership in the Saxon branch of the Franciscan order. To counter the expansion of German language, ≈öwinka organised a synod that took place on 6 January 1285 in ≈Åƒôczyca. During the meeting, he ordered all priests that were subject to his bishopric to give their sermons in Polish language rather than German. To further unify the church in Poland he also organised a series of synods held every couple of years, which served as a means to control the changes within the church. The synods were: # ≈Åƒôczyca, 6 January 1285 # ≈Åƒôczyca, 26 October 1287 # Gniezno, 14 October 1290 # Gniezno, April 1298 # unknown place, May 1306 # Gniezno, May 1309 As a politician, Jakub ≈öwinka was a strong supporter of the idea of re- unification of Poland, divided onto separate duchies after the death of Boleslaus III the Wrymouth. To unify the Polish lands culturally and oppose the aggressive German culture, he strongly promoted the cult of St. Adalbert of Prague, one of the patron saints of Poland. To further his cause, he tried to diminish the tensions between the dukes of various parts of Poland and the Catholic bishops. This was the case with bishop of Wroc≈Çaw Tomasz Zaremba and the Duke of Silesia Henry IV the Righteous, whom ≈öwinka wanted to re conciliate. Jakub ≈öwinka was also a strong supporter of Duke of Greater Poland Przemys≈Ç II. Until recently it was believed that ≈öwinka was the main architect of an alliance signed in 1287 by the most notable dukes of Poland of the Piast dynasty, among them Henry IV the Righteous, Leszek the Black, Przemys≈Ç II and Henry III of G≈Çog√≥w. However, recent studies show that the ongoing conflicts between the dukes of various parts of divided Poland make the existence of such an alliance highly unlikely. However, after the congress of Kalisz, held in January 1293, such an alliance between Przemys≈Ç II, Wladislaus the Short and his brother Casimir I was indeed concluded. The three dukes agreed to support each other in the effort of retaking the lands of Lesser Poland conquered by Wenceslaus II of Bohemia. ≈öwinka was to become a full member of the alliance, probably responsible for propaganda and gathering support of the Pope and the Catholic Church. On 12 January he was also promised a huge reward if Cracow is taken: 300 golden coins a year from the salt mines of Wieliczka and additional 100 golden coins a year for three years after the victory. On 26 July 1295 Jakub ≈öwinka concluded his first major political victory: despite lack of papal acceptance, he crowned Przemys≈Ç II the King of Poland in the cathedral of Gniezno. Although the ruler controlled only a small part of the Polish domain, he was given a powerful weapon against the Bohemian rulers who also had claims to the Polish throne. Because of great authority of the bishop, the act of coronation was not questioned by any European ruler of the epoch. However, the reign of Przemys≈Ç II lasted only 7 months: on 8 February 1296 he was murdered in Rogo≈∫no by the Brandenburgians. Following the treaty Kalisz, ≈öwinka backed up Wladislaus the Short, whom he considered the strongest of the candidates to the throne of Greater Poland and Pomerania, and possibly the only ruler who could reunite Poland and liberate it of Bohemian influence. Wladislaus assumed the power in Greater Poland and Pomerania, and added those lands to his tiny domain of Cuyavia. However, the struggle against other pretenders (Henry III of G≈Çog√≥w and Wenceslaus II of Bohemia) weakened his rule and finally led to a conflict with the Catholic hierarchy. ≈öwinka broke the pacts he had with Wladislaus, and on 25 July 1300 crowned Wenceslaus II as the King of Poland. It is probable that he lost his belief in weak Wladislaus and saw the new king as the Slavic ruler who could be able to group all Polish lands in one hand. However, the new ruler adopted a pro-German position and started promoting Germanised Silesians over Polish-speaking priests and politicians. Since 1304 king Wenceslaus also supported Jan Muskata, Cracow bishop of German-Silesian origin, in his struggle for separation of the Diocese of Cracow from the bishopric of Gniezno, which only embittered the conflict. This led to yet another vote, after which ≈öwinka resumed good relation with dukes of Cuyavia, relatives of defeated Wladislaus. After the sudden death of Wenceslaus II on 21 June 1305, ≈öwinka yet again supported Wladislaus. It is not known how he reacted to assassination of Wenceslaus' son, Wenceslas III of Bohemia less than a year later. After a short fight, Wladislaus recaptured all his lands in Cuyavia, and then conquered Lesser Poland and Pomerania. Greater Poland, to which the city of Gniezno belongs, was conquered by Henry III of G≈Çog√≥w and Jakub ≈öwinka moved to Uniej√≥w and ≈Åowicz, cities controlled by Wladislaus. On 20 March 1306 ≈öwinka restarted the conflict against Jan Muskata. This time the bishop of Cracow was not backed by the rulers of Bohemia who lost all their influence in Poland, while ≈öwinka was strongly endorsed by Wladislaus. This led to Muskata being deprived of his post on 14 June 1308. The archbishop of Gniezno resumed his control over Lesser Poland. However, after 1311 there are no mentions of his political activity. It is probable that he retired due to old age and poor health. He died on 4 March 1314 and was buried in St. George's Church, Gniezno. It took another six years than his prot√©g√© Wladislaus finally reunited Poland and was crowned as Polish king.

Early life and career Born in Kansas City, Missouri, Henderson relocated to the Sugar Hill section of Harlem at the age of four. Following a short stint studying mathematics at the City College of New York, he enrolled at the Juilliard School of Music, where he received a bachelor of science degree in 1942. Drafted into the Navy during World War II, Henderson became an arranger for the Navy band stationed at the Naval Station Great Lakes, prior to becoming the staff orchestrator for The U. S. Navy School of Music in Washington, D.C. from 1944 to 1946. Following the war, Henderson began a long professional association with a number of musical notables of the era, including Duke Ellington, Lena Horne, Jule Styne, and Richard Rodgers. Notably, Henderson maintained a lengthy pre-professional relationship with Ellington, having been neighbors with the Ellington family as a child and schoolmate with his son, Mercer. Henderson went on to serve as classical orchestrator for Ellington's symphonic works, receiving the nickname of being Ellington's \\"classical arm.\\" Broadway Henderson's first foray into Broadway theatre was Ellington's Beggar's Holiday, serving as co-orchestrator alongside Billy Strayhorn. He went on to serve as orchestrator, arranger, and musical director on more than fifty Broadway musicals, including Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music, Flower Drum Song, Funny Girl, No, No Nanette, Purlie, Ain't Misbehavin' and Jelly's Last Jam.

In the early 1970s, Merrill was one of the first westerners to achieve pop star status in Japan. He was the writer of, and lead singer on, the first released version of the song \\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\\", which was recorded by the Arrows in 1975. The song became a breakthrough hit for Joan Jett in 1982. Merrill was primarily a vocalist and songwriter, but also played the guitar, bass guitar, harmonica, and keyboards. He died during the COVID-19 pandemic due to complications brought on by COVID-19. Early life Merrill was born in The Bronx, New York City on February 19, 1951, the son of two jazz musicians, singer Helen Merrill and saxophone/clarinet player Aaron Sachs. He went to Aiglon College in Switzerland from age 9 to 13, a British boarding school. On returning to the United States he attended various schools in New York and Los Angeles, and at Sophia University (a private Jesuit research university in Tokyo, Japan). He started his semi-pro career in New York City aged 14 when he began playing in Greenwich Village's Cafe Wha? with the bands The Kaleidoscope, The Rayne, and Watertower West. The groups played the club during the 1966‚Äì1968 period. Professional career in Japan In 1968, Merrill auditioned for the New York City band, the Left Banke. The audition was successful, but the band dissolved. Shortly thereafter, he left to reside in Japan and started his professional career there with the band The Lead, on RCA Victor Records. The band was a foreign Tokyo-based act. The Lead had one hit single, \\"Akuma ga kureta Aoi Bara\\" (Blue Rose), but the project soon fell apart when two of the American members of the group were deported. In 1969, Merrill signed a solo management deal with Watanabe Productions, who contracted him to Atlantic Records, and changed his professional surname from Sachs (pronounced sax) to Merrill because \\"Merrill\\" sounded less lascivious and was more commercially viable when spoken by young Japanese pop music fans. He recorded one album with Atlantic Records, Alone in Tokyo which yielded one hit single, \\"Namida\\" (Teardrops) and he became the first foreign domestic market pop star in the Japanese Group Sounds. Merrill acted on the popular TV soap opera Jikan Desu Yo and had his own corner as a regular on the TBS's Young 720, a morning show for teens. He was the featured principal as a model in ads for Nissan cars, Jun clothing, AnnAnn, Non-no, and GT Jeans. In 1971 he released an LP of his own compositions titled Merrill 1 in Japan for Denon/Columbia record label produced by Mickey Curtis. At the peak of his fame Tiny Tim covered an Alan Merrill composition from the Merrill 1 album, a song titled \\"Movies\\", in 1972 on Scepter Records. He then formed the band Vodka Collins, which became Japan's top glam rock act. The band included Japanese superstars Hiroshi \\"Monsieur\\" Kamayatsu and Hiroshi Oguchi. Vodka Collins recorded one LP in 1973 titled Tokyo ‚Äì New York, on the EMI Toshiba label, which is still available in CD re-issues. The band are best known for recording and releasing the first popular glam rock songs in Japanese, including the double A-sided single \\"Sands Of Time\\" and \\"Automatic Pilot\\", released June 1973. Professional career in London In 1974 in London, Merrill formed the band Arrows (as lead singer and bass guitarist), with drummer Paul Varley and guitarist Jake Hooker. Peter Meaden was the Arrows' first manager, but later they signed with Mickie Most's RAK Records. In March 1974, the Arrows were in the top 10 in the UK charts with the song \\"Touch Too Much\\". The Arrows became a popular band with teens, and once again Merrill had slid back into the teen market he had fought hard to get out of in Japan. The Arrows had another hit single with \\"My Last Night With You\\" which made the UK top 30 in 1975, but the band's single releases were few and far between as a result of their producer Mickie Most's winding down his own career momentum. Recorded at Morgan studio in London 1974 Merrill played bass guitar on drummer Cozy Powell's chart hit single \\"The Man In Black\\" and the B-side \\"After Dark\\" produced by Mickie Most on RAK records. The recording hit a peak position of No. 18 on the British charts. With the Arrows, Merrill sang three chart hit records as the band's lead singer, all produced by Mickie Most, \\"Touch Too Much\\" (No. 8 UK charts) \\"Toughen Up\\" (No. 51 UK charts) and \\"My Last Night With You\\" (No. 25 UK charts). They made one more single that would be an important one. \\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\\" (1975), a song that started out as a B-side to the 45 rpm Arrows single \\"Broken Down Heart\\". The song \\"I Love Rock 'N Roll\\" was composed by Alan Merrill but with a co-writer credit going to Arrows bandmate Jake Hooker, to whom Merrill owed some money. The recording was later flipped to A-side status, and the band made only one television performance with the song. The show's producer Muriel Young was so impressed with the Arrows that she made a pitch to Granada ITV for them to have their own television series. The Arrows then got their own weekly TV series Arrows in 1976, taking over from the Bay City Rollers Granada TV series Shang-a-Lang. The Arrows signed with MAM Management. Their producer Mickie Most was so angry at the band for signing the management deal, that he vowed to never release another Arrows record. So it came to pass that Arrows had their own weekly television series and no records released during that time. Their ratings were so good that they got a second weekly series, but they released no new recordings. The Arrows disbanded shortly after the end of the second series. In 1977, Merrill married fashion model Cathee Dahmen, and formed a new group, the album-oriented rock act Runner, with Steve Gould (Rare Bird), Mick Feat (Van Morrison band), and Dave Dowle (Whitesnake). The Runner album charted in the Billboard top 100 in the United States. Later professional career In 1980, Merrill joined forces with Rick Derringer as a guitarist/vocalist in New York City. They recorded three albums, Good Dirty Fun, Live at The Ritz, Rick Derringer and Friends, and a film, The Rick Derringer Rock Spectacular. Merrill wrote three songs on the Derringer Good Dirty Fun album, \\"White Heat\\" (Alan Merrill), \\"Shake Me\\" (Alan Merrill/Jake Hooker) and \\"Lesson Learned\\" (Alan Merrill/Rick Derringer). \\"Shake Me\\" was included in the soundtrack of the film Where The Boys Are (1984). In 1982, Joan Jett released a cover of \\"I Love Rock 'N Roll\\", which was No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard charts for seven weeks and helped launch her career. The following year Lou Rawls recorded Alan Merrill's song \\"When The Night Comes\\" as the title track of his 1983 Epic Records album. The Rawls' version of the song was taken into space by astronaut Guion Bluford, the first music taken to and played in outer space. In 1983, Merrill recorded a solo album for Polydor Records, simply titled Alan Merrill, a collection of self-composed tracks. Some friends contributing to this record were Steve Winwood, Mick Taylor and Dallas Taylor. It was released in 1985 and received critical acclaim. In 1986, Merrill joined the Meat Loaf band for the promotional tour of his Blind Before I Stop album, and stayed for several years, and appears on Meat Loaf's 1987 Live at Wembley (1987) album for Arista Records. In 1989, Merrill was offered a role on the television series Encyclopedia Brown on HBO, and was a part of the successful series in his role as principal character Casey Sparkz. Merrill wrote a song for the production, \\"Who Done It?\\" which he performed on the series and was featured in the concert scene. In 1990, a Vodka Collins reunion tour was organized due to popular demand as a result of the successful CD reissue of their debut vinyl LP Tokyo ‚Äì New York. The Tokyo-based band toured Japan, then several years later recorded the first in a series of reunion albums, Chemical Reaction (1996) which was followed by Pink Soup (1997), Boy's Life (1998) and Boys in The Band (2004). The Vodka Collins Tokyo ‚Äì New York album has been reissued again as recently as October 2011 on EMI Japan. While working in Japan with his main project Vodka Collins, Merrill also had a side project in New York, starting with a tribute to Don Covay he began recording with R&B; producer Jon Tiven. This led to the \\"Yes I Ram\\" and \\"Blue Guru\\" albums in the mid-1990s featuring Merrill on lead vocals. Subsequent activity Merrill released the solo albums Never Pet A Burning Dog (1998), Cupid Deranged (2002), A Merrilly Christmas (2001), Double Shot Rocks (2003) - a tribute to songwriters Otis Blackwell and Arthur Alexander, Aleecat (2004), At The Candy Shop (2006), and Rive Gauche (2007) - a tribute to The Left Banke. The reissue Alien in Tokyo, EP single Hard Road, and an in concert album The Aleecat, Live In Japan were all released in 2008. Albums by Merrill titled The Face Of 69 (2010), Numbers (2011), Snakes and Ladders (2012), Songer Singwriter (2013), Arrows, 40th Anniversary Edition (2014), Demo Graphic (2016) On A Blue Avenue (2017) and Radio Zero (2019 ) were also released. The Arrows 1974 top 10 UK hit \\"Touch Too Much\\", featuring lead vocals by Merrill appears on the soundtrack of the feature film The Look Of Love, a 2013 biopic of Paul Raymond. \\"Restless Soul\\", a song Merrill co-wrote with Shinohara Nobuhiko that was on air nightly on the Asahi TV travel show Sekai No Kaido Wo Yuku (Traveling on the roads of the world) in Japan broadcast from 2014 to 2015. The Arrows' songs \\"We Can Make It Together\\" and \\"Moving Next Door To You\\" (composed by Merrill and Jake Hooker) were used on the BBC1 TV show Homes Under The Hammer series 18 episode 70 and series 19 episode 53 respectively in England, first aired on February 5, 2015. The songs were B-sides of the Arrows RAK records top 30 hit singles \\"Touch Too Much\\" and \\"My Last Night With You\\" produced by Mickie Most in 1974 and 1975 with lead vocals by Merrill. In September 2015, Merrill added his guitar parts to popular Japanese vocalist Superfly's cover of his composition, \\"I Love Rock N Roll\\", released three months later on Warner Brothers-Japan records.

The fame of the monastery started to spread under Kirill's disciple, Saint Martinian, who was to become a father superior of the Troitse- Sergiyeva Lavra in 1447. Even after Martinian's death, his monastery was protected and favoured by members of Ivan III's family. The most ancient structure, the Cathedral of Nativity of the Virgin (1490), was built in brick by the masters of Rostov. This edifice is the best preserved of three sister cathedrals erected in the 1490s in the Russian North. All the interior walls are covered with invaluable frescoes by the great medieval painter Dionisius. This is the last surviving Russian medieval church with fully painted walls. During the 1530s, they added a treasury, a refectory, and the unique Annunciation church surmounted by a belfry. At that time the monastery enjoyed special privileges conferred upon it by Ivan the Terrible, and possessed some 60 villages in the vicinity. The tsar himself frequently visited the monastery as a pilgrim. In the Time of Troubles, the monastery was ravaged by the Poles. During its recovery the last buildings ‚Äî the tent-like church of Saint Martinian (1641), a two-tented barbican church (1650), and a bell-tower (1680) ‚Äî were added to the complex. The belfry clocks (1638) are said to be the oldest in Russia. As the monastery gradually lost its religious importance, it was being turned into a place of exile for distinguished clerics, such as the Patriarch Nikon. It was abolished by Emperor Paul in 1798, reinstituted as a convent in 1904, closed by the Bolsheviks twenty years later, and turned into a museum in 1975. The museum constitutes a part of the Russky Sever (Russian North) National Park since 1991. As of January 2013, images of the monastery and grounds were available via Google Street View. ferapontovo.jpgDifficulty of access helped preserve the monastery intact since the 17th century.

He is also credited with introducing a method for pressing the fat (cocoa butter) from roasted cocoa beans, though this was in fact his father, Casparus van Houten's invention. Father and son van Houten Coenraad van Houten was the son of Casparus van Houten (1770‚Äì1858) and Arnoldina Koster. His father opened a chocolate factory in Amsterdam in 1815, with a mill turned by laborers. At that time, cocoa beans were ground into a fine mass, which could then be mixed with milk to create a chocolate drink or, with addition of sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla, made into cookies. Cocoa press In 1828 Casparus van Houten Sr. (and not his son, who is usually credited) patented an inexpensive method for pressing the fat from roasted cocoa beans. The center of the bean, known as the \\"nib\\", contains an average of 54 percent cocoa butter, which is a natural fat. Van Houten's machine ‚Äì a hydraulic press ‚Äì reduced the cocoa butter content by nearly half. This created a \\"cake\\" that could be pulverized into cocoa powder, which was to become the basis of all chocolate products. The introduction of cocoa powder not only made creating chocolate drinks much easier, but also made it possible to combine the powder with sugar and then remix it with cocoa butter to create a solid, already closely resembling today's eating chocolate. In 1838 the patent expired, enabling others to produce cocoa powder and build on Van Houten's success, experimenting to make new chocolate products. In 1847 English chocolate maker J. S. Fry & Sons produced arguably the first chocolate bar. Later developments were in Switzerland, where Daniel Peter introduced milk chocolate in 1875 and Rodolphe Lindt made chocolate more blendable by the process of conching in 1879. =Dutch process chocolate= Coenraad Van Houten introduced a further improvement by treating the powder with alkaline salts (potassium or sodium carbonates) so that the powder would mix more easily with water. Today, this process is known as \\"Dutching\\". The final product, Dutch chocolate, has a dark color and a mild taste. =Later career= In 1835 Coenraad van Houten married Hermina van Houten (unrelated) from Groningen. In 1850 he moved his production from a windmill in Leiden to a steam factory in Weesp. By that time he was exporting chocolate to England, France, and Germany. In 1866 John Cadbury traveled to Weesp to buy a Van Houten press, but did not use it in his manufacturing until 1875. Coenraad's son Casparus Johannes (1844‚Äì1901), employed since 1865, had a gift for marketing and contributed greatly to the growth of the company. Advertisements for Van Houten could be found on trams throughout Europe and the United States. As early as 1899 Van Houten produced a commercial film that depicted a sleepy clerk who recovers miraculously after eating some chocolate. The factory was a boost for the town of Weesp, whose population doubled in the second half of the 19th century. Casparus Jr. had himself built a 99-room Jugendstil villa in Weesp, by the renowned architect Abraham Salm (1857‚Äì1915). Work was started in 1897 but not completed until 1901, the year he died. The Van Houten company was sold in 1962 to W.R. Grace, and the factories in Weesp closed in 1971. The Van Houten brand name, still in use, has been transferred several times since, in 1990 from the German chocolate manufacturer Jacobs Suchard to Philip Morris. It subsequently was owned by the Stollwerck chocolate manufacturing company and since 2002 by Barry Callebaut.Van Houten drinks website The legacy of Dutch process cocoa Dutch process cocoa is generally acknowledged as superior to cocoa not processed in this way. The combination of the inventions by father and son van Houten led to the nineteenth-century mass production and consumption of chocolate, or, as some call it, the \\"democratization\\" of chocolate.  Popular culture  \\"Drink Van Houten's Cocoa!\\" wrote Vladimir Mayakovsky in his poem, A Cloud in Trousers, referencing an urban legend about a publicity trick by Van Houten company: paying a condemned man to shout their slogan directly before being hanged. This infamous citation is the title of Ornela Vorpsi's book from 2010. A Van Houten's Cocoa shop can be seen during the opening battle sequence of Neil Jordan's 1996 film Michael Collins.

It lies on the junction of the A458 and B4380 roads and the River Severn flows around its northern boundary. The Royal Mail postcode begins SY5. The parish council is combined with the neighbouring parish of Sheinton. History The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book under the name Christesache. The meaning is \\"Christ's Oak\\", and this over time has been corrupted to form the word \\"Cressage\\". The oak tree was part of a forest (which no longer exists), and a cutting from it was planted near the village in 1616. This was later relocated due to railway construction. In 584, Saint Augustine reputedly preached under the Cressage Oak. On 30 June 2012, the Olympic torch passed through the village on its way to London. Geography The Severn Valley Railway once ran through the village calling at Cressage railway station, before the section between Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth was dismantled. The village lies on the intersection of the A458 and the B4380, near to the River Severn. Cressage is 4 miles to the northwest of the nearest town Much Wenlock and is 8 miles southeast of Shrewsbury. Cressage Bridge lies several hundred metres north of the village and carries the B4380 road over the River Severn. Designed by L.G. Mouchel and built in 1913, it has a hollow construction of reinforced concrete and a span of 170 feet (52 metres).http://www.severntales.co.uk/shropshirebridges.html There are two hexagonal brick pill boxes, one on each side of the river, constructed during the Second World War to defend the bridge in the event of enemy invasion. The parish's war memorial, in the form of a granite 'wheel' or Celtic cross, stands at the village's main road junction on the A458. Amenities Cressage had a public house, \\"The Eagles\\" which was shut down early 2008, but reopened December 2009. It was once again shut down in early 2015 and sold at auction. It currently remains closed. The Anglican church, \\"Christ Church\\" holds regular services. There is a small village store and a health centre.

In other works, landscape backgrounds for figures can still form an important part of the work. Sky is almost always included in the view, and weather is often an element of the composition. Detailed landscapes as a distinct subject are not found in all artistic traditions, and develop when there is already a sophisticated tradition of representing other subjects. Two main traditions spring from Western painting and Chinese art, going back well over a thousand years in both cases. The recognition of a spiritual element in landscape art is present from its beginnings in East Asian art, drawing on Daoism and other philosophical traditions, but in the West only becomes explicit with Romanticism. Landscape views in art may be entirely imaginary, or copied from reality with varying degrees of accuracy. If the primary purpose of a picture is to depict an actual, specific place, especially including buildings prominently, it is called a topographical view.British Library, Topographical collections: an overview . Such views, extremely common as prints in the West, are often seen as inferior to fine art landscapes, although the distinction is not always meaningful; similar prejudices existed in Chinese art, where literati painting usually depicted imaginary views, while professional artists painted real views.British Library, Topographical prints and drawings: glossary of terms . The word \\"landscape\\" entered the modern English language as landskip (variously spelt), an anglicization of the Dutch landschap, around the start of the 17th century, purely as a term for works of art, with its first use as a word for a painting in 1598.OED \\"Landscape\\". Within a few decades it was used to describe vistas in poetry,1632, John Milton in L'Allegro is the earliest cited by the OED and eventually as a term for real views.

Idealized Italianate landscape background. Pieter Brueghel the Elder, The Harvesters, 1565: Peace and agriculture in a pre-Romantic ideal landscape, without sublime terrors Rembrandt, The Three Trees, 1643, etching The earliest forms of art around the world depict little that could really be called landscape, although ground-lines and sometimes indications of mountains, trees or other natural features are included. The earliest \\"pure landscapes\\" with no human figures are frescos from Minoan Greece of around 1500 BCE.Honour & Fleming, 53. The only very complete example is now in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens Hunting scenes, especially those set in the enclosed vista of the reed beds of the Nile Delta from Ancient Egypt, can give a strong sense of place, but the emphasis is on individual plant forms and human and animal figures rather than the overall landscape setting. The frescos from the Tomb of Nebamun, now in the British Museum (c. 1350 BC), are a famous example. For a coherent depiction of a whole landscape, some rough system of perspective, or scaling for distance, is needed, and this seems from literary evidence to have first been developed in Ancient Greece in the Hellenistic period, although no large-scale examples survive. More ancient Roman landscapes survive, from the 1st century BCE onwards, especially frescos of landscapes decorating rooms that have been preserved at archaeological sites of Pompeii, Herculaneum and elsewhere, and mosaics.Honour & Fleming, 150‚Äì151 The Chinese ink painting tradition of shan shui (\\"mountain-water\\"), or \\"pure\\" landscape, in which the only sign of human life is usually a sage, or a glimpse of his hut, uses sophisticated landscape backgrounds to figure subjects, and landscape art of this period retains a classic and much-imitated status within the Chinese tradition. Both the Roman and Chinese traditions typically show grand panoramas of imaginary landscapes, generally backed with a range of spectacular mountains ‚Äì in China often with waterfalls and in Rome often including sea, lakes or rivers. These were frequently used, as in the example illustrated, to bridge the gap between a foreground scene with figures and a distant panoramic vista, a persistent problem for landscape artists. The Chinese style generally showed only a distant view, or used dead ground or mist to avoid that difficulty. A major contrast between landscape painting in the West and East Asia has been that while in the West until the 19th century it occupied a low position in the accepted hierarchy of genres, in East Asia the classic Chinese mountain-water ink painting was traditionally the most prestigious form of visual art. Aesthetic theories in both regions gave the highest status to the works seen to require the most imagination from the artist. In the West this was history painting, but in East Asia it was the imaginary landscape, where famous practitioners were, at least in theory, amateur literati, including several Emperors of both China and Japan. They were often also poets whose lines and images illustrated each other.A major theme throughout both Sickman and Paine. See for example Sickmann pp. 132‚Äì133, 182‚Äì186, 203‚Äì204, 319, 352‚Äì356, and Paine pp. 160‚Äì168, 235‚Äì243. However, in the West, history painting came to require an extensive landscape background where appropriate, so the theory did not entirely work against the development of landscape painting ‚Äì for several centuries landscapes were regularly promoted to the status of history painting by the addition of small figures to make a narrative scene, typically religious or mythological. =Western tradition= Medieval In early Western medieval art interest in landscape disappears almost entirely, kept alive only in copies of Late Antique works such as the Utrecht Psalter; the last reworking of this source, in an early Gothic version, reduces the previously extensive landscapes to a few trees filling gaps in the composition, with no sense of overall space.Clark, 17‚Äì18 A revival in interest in nature initially mainly manifested itself in depictions of small gardens such as the Hortus Conclusus or those in millefleur tapestries. The frescos of figures at work or play in front of a background of dense trees in the Palace of the Popes, Avignon are probably a unique survival of what was a common subject.Clark, 23-4; image, another Several frescos of gardens have survived from Roman houses like the Villa of Livia.Now removed to the Palazzo Massimo; Commons images During the 14th century Giotto di Bondone and his followers began to acknowledge nature in their work, increasingly introducing elements of the landscape as the background setting for the action of the figures in their paintings.The landscape in Western Painting, Minneapolis Institute of the Arts retrieved February 20, 2010 Early in the 15th century, landscape painting was established as a genre in Europe, as a setting for human activity, often expressed in a religious subject, such as the themes of the Rest on the Flight into Egypt, the Journey of the Magi, or Saint Jerome in the Desert. Luxury illuminated manuscripts were very important in the early development of landscape, especially series of the Labours of the Months such as those in the Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, which conventionally showed small genre figures in increasingly large landscape settings. A particular advance is shown in the less well-known Turin-Milan Hours, now largely destroyed by fire, whose developments were reflected in Early Netherlandish painting for the rest of the century. The artist known as \\"Hand G\\", probably one of the Van Eyck brothers, was especially successful in reproducing effects of light and in a natural-seeming progression from the foreground to the distant view.Clark, 31-2 This was something other artists were to find difficult for a century or more, often solving the problem by showing a landscape background from over the top of a parapet or window-sill, as if from a considerable height.Clark, 34-37 Renaissance Landscape backgrounds for various types of painting became increasingly prominent and skillful during the 15th century. The period around the end of the 15th century saw pure landscape drawings and watercolours from Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht D√ºrer, Fra Bartolomeo and others, but pure landscape subjects in painting and printmaking, still small, were first produced by Albrecht Altdorfer and others of the German Danube School in the early 16th century.Honour & Fleming, 357, see Wood for full coverage At the same time Joachim Patinir in the Netherlands developed the \\"world landscape\\" a style of panoramic landscape with small figures and using a high aerial viewpoint, that remained influential for a century, being used and perfected by Pieter Brueghel the Elder. The Italian development of a thorough system of graphical perspective was now known all over Europe, which allowed large and complex views to be painted very effectively. Landscapes were idealized, mostly reflecting a pastoral ideal drawn from classical poetry which was first fully expressed by Giorgione and the young Titian, and remained associated above all with hilly wooded Italian landscape, which was depicted by artists from Northern Europe who had never visited Italy, just as plain-dwelling literati in China and Japan painted vertiginous mountains. Though often young artists were encouraged to visit Italy to experience Italian light, many Northern European artists could make their living selling Italianate landscapes without ever bothering to make the trip. Indeed, certain styles were so popular that they became formulas that could be copied again and again.See the landscape work of Barent Gael and Jacob van der Ulft, for example, whose Italian-style landscapes were formulaic copies, sometimes from prints. The publication in Antwerp in 1559 and 1561 of two series of a total of 48 prints (the Small Landscapes) after drawings by an anonymous artist referred to as the Master of the Small Landscapes signaled a shift away from the imaginary, distant landscapes with religious content of the world landscape towards close-up renderings at eye-level of identifiable country estates and villages populated with figures engaged in daily activities. By abandoning the panoramic viewpoint of the world landscape and focusing on the humble, rural and even topographical, the Small Landscapes set the stage for Netherlandish landscape painting in the 17th century. After the publication of the Small Landscapes, landscape artists in the Low Countries either continued with the world landscape or followed the new mode presented by the Small Landscapes.Silver, p. 6-7 17th and 18th centuries Claude Lorrain, Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia, 1682. The landscape as history painting. Jan van Goyen, Dune landscape, c. 1630‚Äì1635, an example of the \\"tonal\\" style in Dutch Golden Age painting The popularity of exotic landscape scenes can be seen in the success of the painter Frans Post, who spent the rest of his life painting Brazilian landscapes after a trip there in 1636‚Äì1644. Other painters who never crossed the Alps could make money selling Rhineland landscapes, and still others for constructing fantasy scenes for a particular commission such as Cornelis de Man's view of Smeerenburg in 1639. Compositional formulae using elements like the repoussoir were evolved which remain influential in modern photography and painting, notably by PoussinPoussin and The Heroic Landscape by Joseph Phelan, retrieved December 17, 2009 and Claude Lorrain, both French artists living in 17th century Rome and painting largely classical subject-matter, or Biblical scenes set in the same landscapes. Unlike their Dutch contemporaries, Italian and French landscape artists still most often wanted to keep their classification within the hierarchy of genres as history painting by including small figures to represent a scene from classical mythology or the Bible. Salvator Rosa gave picturesque excitement to his landscapes by showing wilder Southern Italian country, often populated by banditi.Clark, Chapter 4 Dutch Golden Age painting of the 17th century saw the dramatic growth of landscape painting, in which many artists specialized, and the development of extremely subtle realist techniques for depicting light and weather. There are different styles and periods, and sub-genres of marine and animal painting, as well as a distinct style of Italianate landscape. Most Dutch landscapes were relatively small, but landscapes in Flemish Baroque painting, still usually peopled, were often very large, above all in the series of works that Peter Paul Rubens painted for his own houses. Landscape prints were also popular, with those of Rembrandt and the experimental works of Hercules Seghers usually considered the finest. The Dutch tended to make smaller paintings for smaller houses. Some Dutch landscape specialties named in period inventories include the Batalje, or battle-scene;See the work of Willem van de Velde the Younger, Huchtenburg and Pauwels van Hillegaert the Maneschijntje,See the work of Aert van der Neer or moonlight scene; the Bosjes,See the work of Jacques van Artois or woodland scene; the Boederijtje, or farm scene,See the work of Adriaen van Ostade and the Dorpje or village scene.See the work of Roelant Roghman Though not named at the time as a specific genre, the popularity of Roman ruins inspired many Dutch landscape painters of the period to paint the ruins of their own region, such as monasteries and churches ruined after the Beeldenstorm.The ruins of Egmond Abbey were popular for a century. Jacob van Ruisdael is considered the most versatile of all Dutch Golden Age landscape painters.Slive 17 The popularity of landscapes in the Netherlands was in part a reflection of the virtual disappearance of religious painting in a Calvinist society, and the decline of religious painting in the 18th and 19th centuries all over Europe combined with Romanticism to give landscapes a much greater and more prestigious place in 19th-century art than they had assumed before. In England, landscapes had initially been mostly backgrounds to portraits, typically suggesting the parks or estates of a landowner, though mostly painted in London by an artist who had never visited his sitter's rolling acres. The English tradition was founded by Anthony van Dyck and other mostly Flemish artists working in England, but in the 18th century the works of Claude Lorrain were keenly collected and influenced not only paintings of landscapes, but the English landscape gardens of Capability Brown and others. Watercolour in the English tradition, John Robert Cozens, Lake of Vico Between Rome and Florence, c. 1783 In the 18th century, watercolour painting, mostly of landscapes, became an English specialty, with both a buoyant market for professional works, and a large number of amateur painters, many following the popular systems found in the books of Alexander Cozens and others. By the beginning of the 19th century the English artists with the highest modern reputations were mostly dedicated landscape painters, showing the wide range of Romantic interpretations of the English landscape found in the works of John Constable, J.M.W. Turner and Samuel Palmer. However all these had difficulty establishing themselves in the contemporary art market, which still preferred history paintings and portraits.Reitlinger, 74-75, 85-87 In Europe, as John Ruskin said,Modern Painters, volume three, \\"Of the novelty of landscape\\". and Sir Kenneth Clark confirmed, landscape painting was the \\"chief artistic creation of the nineteenth century\\", and \\"the dominant art\\", with the result that in the following period people were \\"apt to assume that the appreciation of natural beauty and the painting of landscape is a normal and enduring part of our spiritual activity\\"Clark, 15‚Äì16. In Clark's analysis, underlying European ways to convert the complexity of landscape to an idea were four fundamental approaches: the acceptance of descriptive symbols, a curiosity about the facts of nature, the creation of fantasy to allay deep- rooted fears of nature, and the belief in a Golden Age of harmony and order, which might be retrieved. The 18th century was also a great age for the topographical print, depicting more or less accurately a real view in a way that landscape painting rarely did. Initially these were mostly centred on a building, but over the course of the century, with the growth of the Romantic movement pure landscapes became more common. The topographical print, often intended to be framed and hung on a wall, remained a very popular medium into the 20th century, but was often classed as a lower form of art than an imagined landscape. Landscapes in watercolour on paper became a distinct specialism, above all in England, where a particular tradition of talented artists who only, or almost entirely, painted landscape watercolours developed, as it did not in other countries. These were very often real views, though sometimes the compositions were adjusted for artistic effect. The paintings sold relatively cheaply, but were far quicker to produce. These professionals could augment their income by training the \\"armies of amateurs\\" who also painted.Wilton & Lyles, 11-28, 28 quoted Leading artists included John Robert Cozens, Francis Towne, Thomas Girtin, Michael Angelo Rooker, William Pars, Thomas Hearne, and John Warwick Smith, all in the late 18th century, and Joseph Mallord William Turner, John Varley, John Sell Cotman, Anthony Copley Fielding, Samuel Palmer in the early 19th.See Wilton & Lyles, for all these 19th and 20th centuries Caspar David Friedrich, Wanderer above the Sea of Fog, 1818. A classic image of German Romanticism. Joseph Mallord William Turner, The Park at Petworth House, c. 1830 Frederic Edwin Church, The Heart of the Andes, 1859. Church was part of the American Hudson River School. The Romantic movement intensified the existing interest in landscape art, and remote and wild landscapes, which had been one recurring element in earlier landscape art, now became more prominent. The German Caspar David Friedrich had a distinctive style, influenced by his Danish training, where a distinct national style, drawing on the Dutch 17th-century example, had developed. To this he added a quasi-mystical Romanticism. French painters were slower to develop landscape painting, but from about the 1830s Jean- Baptiste-Camille Corot and other painters in the Barbizon School established a French landscape tradition that would become the most influential in Europe for a century, with the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists for the first time making landscape painting the main source of general stylistic innovation across all types of painting. The nationalism of the new United Provinces had been a factor in the popularity of Dutch 17th-century landscape painting and in the 19th century, as other nations attempted to develop distinctive national schools of painting, the attempt to express the special nature of the landscape of the homeland became a general tendency. In Russia, as in America, the gigantic size of paintings was itself a nationalist statement. Carlos de Haes, Los Picos de Europa, 1876 In Spain, the main promoter of the genre was the Belgium-born painter Carlos de Haes, one of the most active landscape professors at the Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid since 1857. After studying with the great Flemish landscape masters, he developed his technique to paint outdoors. Back in Spain, Haes took his students with him to paint in the countryside; under his teaching the \\"painters proliferated and took advantage of the new railway system to explore the furthest corners of the nation's topography.\\" In the United States, the Hudson River School, prominent in the middle to late 19th century, is probably the best-known native development in landscape art. These painters created works of mammoth scale that attempted to capture the epic scope of the landscapes that inspired them. The work of Thomas Cole, the school's generally acknowledged founder, has much in common with the philosophical ideals of European landscape paintings ‚Äî a kind of secular faith in the spiritual benefits to be gained from the contemplation of natural beauty. Some of the later Hudson River School artists, such as Albert Bierstadt, created less comforting works that placed a greater emphasis (with a great deal of Romantic exaggeration) on the raw, even terrifying power of nature. Frederic Edwin Church, a student of Cole, synthesized the ideas of his contemporaries with those of European Old Masters and the writings of John Ruskin and Alexander von Humboldt to become the foremost American landscape painter of the century. The best examples of Canadian landscape art can be found in the works of the Group of Seven, prominent in the 1920s.\\"Landscapes\\" in Virtual Vault , an online exhibition of Canadian historical art at Library and Archives Canada Although certainly less dominant in the period after World War I, many significant artists still painted landscapes in the wide variety of styles exemplified by Edvard Munch, Georgia O'Keeffe, Charles E.

Painting and poem by Shen Zhou: \\"White clouds encircle the mountain waist like a sash,/Stone steps mount high into the void where the narrow path leads far./Alone, leaning on my rustic staff I gaze idly into the distance./My longing for the notes of a flute is answered in the murmurings of the gorge.\\"Sickman, 322. Dong Qichang, Landscape 1597. Dong Qichang was a high- ranking but cantankerous Ming civil servant, who valued expressiveness over delicacy, with collector's seals and poems. Landscape painting has been called \\"China's greatest contribution to the art of the world\\",Sickman, 182 and owes its special character to the Taoist (Daoist) tradition in Chinese culture.Sickman, 54-55 William Watson notes that \\"It has been said that the role of landscape art in Chinese painting corresponds to that of the nude in the west, as a theme unvarying in itself, but made the vehicle of infinite nuances of vision and feeling\\".Watson, 72 There are increasingly sophisticated landscape backgrounds to figure subjects showing hunting, farming or animals from the Han dynasty onwards, with surviving examples mostly in stone or clay reliefs from tombs, which are presumed to follow the prevailing styles in painting, no doubt without capturing the full effect of the original paintings.Sickman, 82-84, and 186 The exact status of the later copies of reputed works by famous painters (many of whom are recorded in literature) before the 10th century is unclear. One example is a famous 8th-century painting from the Imperial collection, titled The Emperor Ming Huang traveling in Shu. This shows the entourage riding through vertiginous mountains of the type typical of later paintings, but is in full colour \\"producing an overall pattern that is almost Persian\\", in what was evidently a popular and fashionable court style.Sickman, 182‚Äì183. p. 182 quoted. The decisive shift to a monochrome landscape style, almost devoid of figures, is attributed to Wang Wei (699-759), also famous as a poet; mostly only copies of his works survive.Sickman, 184‚Äì186, and p. 203 From the 10th century onwards an increasing number of original paintings survive, and the best works of the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279) Southern School remain among the most highly regarded in what has been an uninterrupted tradition to the present day. Chinese convention valued the paintings of the amateur scholar-gentleman, often a poet as well, over those produced by professionals, though the situation was more complex than that.Sickman, 304-305 If they include any figures, they are very often such persons, or sages, contemplating the mountains. Famous works have accumulated numbers of red \\"appreciation seals\\", and often poems added by later owners - the Qianlong Emperor (1711‚Äì1799) was a prolific adder of his own poems, following earlier Emperors. The shan shui tradition was never intended to represent actual locations, even when named after them, as in the convention of the Eight Views.Princeton University Art Museum Wang Hong (act. ca. 1131-ca. 1161), Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers (Xiao-Xiang ba jing) A different style, produced by workshops of professional court artists, painted official views of Imperial tours and ceremonies, with the primary emphasis on highly detailed scenes of crowded cities and grand ceremonials from a high viewpoint. These were painted on scrolls of enormous length in bright colour (example below). Chinese sculpture also achieves the difficult feat of creating effective landscapes in three dimensions. There is a long tradition of the appreciation of \\"viewing stones\\" - naturally formed boulders, typically limestone from the banks of mountain rivers that has been eroded into fantastic shapes, were transported to the courtyards and gardens of the literati. Probably associated with these is the tradition of carving much smaller boulders of jade or some other semi-precious stone into the shape of a mountain, including tiny figures of monks or sages. Chinese gardens also developed a highly sophisticated aesthetic much earlier than those in the West; the karensansui or Japanese dry garden of Zen Buddhism takes the garden even closer to being a work of sculpture, representing a highly abstracted landscape.

Japan Four from a set of sixteen sliding room partitions made for a 16th-century Japanese abbot. Typically for later Japanese landscapes, the main focus is on a feature in the foreground. Japanese art initially adapted Chinese styles to reflect their interest in narrative themes in art, with scenes set in landscapes mixing with those showing palace or city scenes using the same high view point, cutting away roofs as necessary. These appeared in the very long yamato-e scrolls of scenes illustrating the Tale of Genji and other subjects, mostly from the 12th and 13th centuries. The concept of the gentleman-amateur painter had little resonance in feudal Japan, where artists were generally professionals with a strong bond to their master and his school, rather than the classic artists from the distant past, from which Chinese painters tended to draw their inspiration.Paine, 20-21 Painting was initially fully coloured, often brightly so, and the landscape never overwhelms the figures who are often rather oversized. The scene illustrated at right is from a scroll that in full measures 37.8 cm √ó 802.0 cm, for only one of twelve scrolls illustrating the life of a Buddhist monk; like their Western counterparts, monasteries and temples commissioned many such works, and these have had a better chance of survival than courtly equivalents.Paine, 153‚Äì154 Even rarer are survivals of landscape by≈çbu folding screens and hanging scrolls, which seem to have common in court circles - the Tale of Genji has an episode where members of the court produce the best paintings from their collections for a competition. These were closer to Chinese shan shui, but still fully coloured.Paine, 107‚Äì108 Many more pure landscape subjects survive from the 15th century onwards; several key artists are Zen Buddhist clergy, and worked in a monochrome style with greater emphasis on brush strokes in the Chinese manner. Some schools adopted a less refined style, with smaller views giving greater emphasis to the foreground. A type of image that had an enduring appeal for Japanese artists, and came to be called the \\"Japanese style\\", is in fact first found in China. This combines one or more large birds, animals or trees in the foreground, typically to one side in a horizontal composition, with a wider landscape beyond, often only covering portions of the background. Later versions of this style often dispensed with a landscape background altogether. The ukiyo-e style that developed from the 16th century onwards, first in painting and then in coloured woodblock prints that were cheap and widely available, initially concentrated on the human figure, individually and in groups. But from the late 18th century landscape ukiyo-e developed under Hokusai and Hiroshige to become much the best known type of Japanese landscape art.Paine, 269-272 Image:Shubun - untitled.jpgTensh≈ç Sh≈´bun, a Zen Buddhist monk, an early figure in the revival of Chinese styles in Japan.

Rocky mountainous country is preferred, which is shown full of animals and plants which are carefully and individually depicted, as are rock formations. The particular convention of the elevated viewpoint that developed in the tradition fills most of the vertical format picture spaces with the landscape, though clouds are also typically shown in the sky. Usually, everything seen is fairly close to the viewer, and there are few distant views. Normally all landscape images show narrative scenes with figures, but there are a few drawn pure landscape scenes in albums. Hindu painting had long set scenes amid lush vegetation, as many of the stories depicted demanded. Mughal painting combined this and the Persian style, and in miniatures of royal hunts often depicted wide landscapes. Scenes set during the monsoon rains, with dark clouds and flashes of lightning, are popular. Later, influence from European prints is evident.

Folio from Isarda Bhagavata Purana. 1560-65, Metmuseum.jpgThe Gopis Plead with Krishna to Return Their Clothing, 1560s Techniques Korean version of the Chinese literati style by Jeong Seon who was unusual in often painting landscapes from life. Most early landscapes are clearly imaginary, although from very early on townscape views are clearly intended to represent actual cities, with varying degrees of accuracy. Various techniques were used to simulate the randomness of natural forms in invented compositions: the medieval advice of Cennino Cennini to copy ragged crags from small rough rocks was apparently followed by both Poussin and Thomas Gainsborough, while Degas copied cloud forms from a crumpled handkerchief held up against the light.Clark, 26 The system of Alexander Cozens used random ink blots to give the basic shape of an invented landscape, to be elaborated by the artist. The Denver Post Landscape painting, The art of Colorado's landscape The distinctive background view across Lake Geneva to the Le M√¥le peak in The Miraculous Draught of Fishes by Konrad Witz (1444) is often cited as the first Western rural landscape to show a specific scene.Clark, 34 The landscape studies by D√ºrer clearly represent actual scenes, which can be identified in many cases, and were at least partly made on the spot; the drawings by Fra Bartolomeo also seem clearly sketched from nature. D√ºrer's finished works seem generally to use invented landscapes, although the spectacular bird's-eye view in his engraving Nemesis shows an actual view in the Alps, with additional elements. Several landscapists are known to have made drawings and watercolour sketches from nature, but the evidence for early oil painting being done outside is limited. The Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood made special efforts in this direction, but it was not until the introduction of ready-mixed oil paints in tubes in the 1870s, followed by the portable \\"box easel\\", that painting en plein air became widely practiced. A curtain of mountains at the back of the landscape is standard in wide Roman views and even more so in Chinese landscapes. Relatively little space is given to the sky in early works in either tradition; the Chinese often used mist or clouds between mountains, and also sometimes show clouds in the sky far earlier than Western artists, who initially mainly use clouds as supports or covers for divine figures or heaven. Both panel paintings and miniatures in manuscripts usually had a patterned or gold \\"sky\\" or background above the horizon until about 1400, but frescos by Giotto and other Italian artists had long shown plain blue skies. The single surviving altarpiece from Melchior Broederlam, completed for Champmol in 1399, has a gold sky populated not only by God and angels, but also a flying bird. A coastal scene in the Turin-Milan Hours has a sky overcast with carefully observed clouds. In woodcuts a large blank space can cause the paper to sag during printing, so D√ºrer and other artists often include clouds or squiggles representing birds to avoid this. The monochrome Chinese tradition has used ink on silk or paper since its inception, with a great emphasis on the individual brushstroke to define the ts'un or \\"wrinkles\\" in mountain-sides, and the other features of the landscape. Western watercolour is a more tonal medium, even with underdrawing visible.

Archip Kuindshi, Night on the Dnieper River, 1882 Traditionally, landscape art depicts the surface of the Earth, but there are other sorts of landscapes, such as moonscapes. *Skyscapes or Cloudscapes are depictions of clouds, weatherforms, and atmospheric conditions. *Moonscapes show the landscape of a moon. *Seascapes depict oceans or beaches. *Riverscapes depict rivers or creeks. *Cityscapes or townscapes depict cities (urban landscapes). * Battle scenes are a subdivision of military painting which, when depicting a battle from afar, are set within a landscape, seascape or even a cityscape. *Hardscapes are paved over areas like streets and sidewalks, large business complexes and housing developments, and industrial areas. *Aerial landscapes depict a surface or ground from above, especially as seen from an airplane or spacecraft. (When the viewpoint is directly overhead, looking down, there is of course no depiction of a horizon or sky.) This genre can be combined with others, as in the aerial cloudscapes of Georgia O'Keeffe, the aerial moonscapes of Nancy Graves, or the aerial cityscapes of Yvonne Jacquette. *Inscapes are landscape-like (usually surrealist or abstract) artworks which seek to convey the psychoanalytic view of the mind as a three-dimensional space. [For sources on this statement, see the Inscape (visual art) article.] *Vedute is the Italian term for view, and generally used for the painted landscape, often cityscapes which were a common 18th-century painting thematic. *Landscape photography =Landscape and modernism= File:Albert Pinkham Ryder 003.jpgAlbert Pinkham Ryder, Seacoast in Moonlight, 1890, the Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C..

It is about south of the county town of Shrewsbury, and just east of the A49. The Cound Brook flows through the village on its way from the Stretton Hills to a confluence with the River Severn. Condover is near to the villages of Dorrington, Bayston Hill and Berrington. The population of the Condover parish was estimated as 1,972 for 2008, of which an estimated 659 live in the village of Condover itself.ONS MYE Population Estimates 2008 The actual population measured at the 2011 census had fallen to 1,957. Condover contains a higher than normal proportion of listed buildings and over half of the village has been classified as a conservation area since 1976.Condover conservation area map The more than forty listed structures in Condover range from six separate early cruck-framed buildings and many black-and-white timbered cottages to the present-day vicarage and several funerary monuments in the churchyard. Of the early half-timbered houses, the most impressive are Church House, the Old School House and the Small House that is now known as Condover Court.Conservation area PDF with many photos The parish contains two industrial estates, two sand and gravel quarries and a projected borough recycling plant is currently planned and under discussion. Villagers and the parish council are agreed that there should be no increase in the volume of heavy traffic in the parish arising from the plant and would regret the detrimental effect to such village services as the post office, shops, primary school and other regular services. History =Medieval beginnings= In the Anglo-Saxon era between 613 and 1017 the village was the principal settlement in the Hundred of Condover, an administrative area that was large enough to sustain about 100 households. By the 11th century Condover was a royal manor of King Edward the Confessor. It formed a significant part of the great royal forest known as the Long Forest, which stretched almost the full length of South Shropshire. The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as Conendovre, and the Norman manor house is believed to have stood on the site now occupied by Church House, a short distance north west of the Church. It would also appear that there was a mill on the Cound Brook in the village which produced a good annual income. At the time of the Domesday census, Condover was held by Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, who had been granted seven-eighths of Shropshire by his cousin William I in 1071. The revenues of the manor were later forfeited by Robert de Bell√™me, Earl Roger's heir, and returned to Royal hands under Henry I. As with other royal manors, the affairs of Condover were managed by the local Shire reeve or sheriff, whose duty it was to keep the King's forest and manor well stocked and maintained. In 1226, Henry III visited Shrewsbury to meet his brother-in-law, Prince Llewellyn ap Gruffydd of Wales. Henry offered Condover to Llewellyn as a goodwill gesture, but sustained wars and skirmishes between England and Wales throughout the 13th century ensured that stable tenure of Condover manor and Hundred did not settle for nearly 300 years. =Later history= Condover hall from the front driveway The Royal manor passed in and out of Crown tenure until, in 1586, Elizabeth I finally made a charter grant of the Condover manor lands to Chief Justice Thomas Owen, a Member of Parliament and Recorder of Shrewsbury. Owen began the building of the current Condover Hall but died before its completion. The hall remained in the Owen family and its descendants for over 300 years. John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales of 1870‚Äì72 describes Condover: :\\"CONDOVER, a village, a parish, a sub-district, and a hundred, in Salop. The village stands on an affluent of the river Severn, adjacent to the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway, 4¬Ω miles S of Shrewsbury; and has a station on the railway, and a post office under Shrewsbury. The parish includes also the villages of Chatford and Dorrington. Acres, 7,422. Real property, ¬£14,431. Pop., 1,871. Houses, 376. The property is subdivided. Condover House is the seat of E. W. S. Owen, Esq.; and was built, about 1590, by Chief Justice Owen. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Lichfield. Value, ¬£258.* Patron, R. Cholmondely, Esq. The church is chiefly Norman; contains monuments of the Owens, one of them by Roubiliac; and is good. The p. curacy of Dorrington is a separate benefice. Charities, ¬£66. -The sub-district is in Atcham district; and contains fourteen parishes. Acres, 37, 057. Pop., 6, 063. Houses, 1, 157. -The hundred includes most of the sub-district; extends considerably beyond it; and is cut into the divisions of Condover and Cound. Acres, 25,630 and 19,684. Pop. of the whole, 6,551. Houses, 1,261.\\" Page 112 of Magna Carta Ancestry by Douglas Richardson and Kimball Everingham records that Anne Owen, daughter of Roger Owen esq and The Honourable Alice of Condover Hall, married Sir St John Booth of Dunham- Massey, Cheshire, in 1662 and they had a son named Thomas in 1663. In 1930 GWR 4900 Class steam locomotive No. 4915 was built and named Condover Hall. It was in regular service until British Railways withdrew it 1965. In the 1980s Hornby Railways produced an electric model of the engine. =World War Two= RAF Condover was opened in August 1942 and was used variously as a fighter, bomber and a training base during the Second World War, closing in June 1945.RAF Condover Many of the original buildings including the control tower still stand although most of the three concrete runways have been removed. RAF Condover now forms a major part of Berriewood Farm and Condover Industrial Estate. Condover Hall was commandeered as the station's officers' mess during the station's operational years. Between the latter years of the war and the autumn of 1947 Condover was the site of a Prisoner of War (POW) camp for German airmen, who were employed as farm labourers in the local area. The prisoners were housed in the former WAAF accommodation huts at RAF Condover. Several of the POWs settled permanently in the Shrewsbury area and married local women. =Residential school= The Elizabethan manor house in Condover, Condover Hall, was sold to and operated by the RNIB as the residential Condover Hall School for the Blind until 2005.RNIB closure Sold to the private Priory Educational Group, the hall later became home to Condover Horizon School for autistic children. The Priory Group closed the school and college in mid-2009 and the property was again offered for sale. In 2011 JCA Adventure bought the house, and it now hosts children's residential adventure holidays. =Condover in the media= The lanes, footpaths and woodlands around Condover and Bomere Pool featured in several of the medieval detective novels about Brother Cadfael by novelist Ellis Peters. In 1988 the BBC filmed a three-part documentary about the RNIB residential school at Condover Hall, and the children were filmed extensively in and around the village. Governance =Historical= Condover originally formed a principal part of the ancient Hundred of Condover. =Parish Council= There are 12 parish councillors representing Condover, which is a warded parish: * Condover Ward is represented by five parish councillors * Dorrington Ward is represented by four parish councillors * Ryton Ward is represented by one parish councillor * Stapleton Ward is represented by two parish councillors =County= The parish, along with a number of others to its south, is part of the Burnell electoral division, which returns one councillor to Shropshire Council. =Westminster= The parish is part of the Shrewsbury and Atcham parliamentary constituency, and the Member of Parliament since 2005 is Daniel Kawczynski of the Conservative Party. Demographics =Historical= In the 1801 census Condover's total population was 1,251. In 1901 it was 1,658 and by 1971 the population had fallen to 1,488. =Current= The population of the Condover parish was estimated as 1,972 for 2008, of which an estimated 659 lived in the village of Condover itself. Geography The village lies just four miles south of Shrewsbury and is separated from the county town by the main A5 trunk road. It has good road transport links with easy access to both the A49 and A5. To the west lies the Pre-Cambrian Lyth Hill, with Sharpstone Hill standing to the north, the latter now mostly a major sandstone quarry with little of the hill itself now remaining after several hundred years of constant quarrying activities.Sharpstone Hill =Waterway= The village of Condover is in a low-lying area, towards the southern end of the Shropshire- Severn plain. The gently undulating land in the vicinity is bisected by Cound Brook, an important local tributary of the River Severn, which rises in the Stretton Hills some seven miles to the south west. =Geology= Condover stands in the lee of an outcropping spur, consisting of a Pre-Cambrian limestone and sandstone sedimentary rock extension of the Longmyndian range, intruding into the Shropshire-Severn plain with major appearances at Longden, Lyth Hill, Bayston Hill, and Sharpstone Hill. North of the River Severn it does not outcrop again until it appears east of Shrewsbury as Haughmond Hill. The sediments were laid down under a vast warm ocean, surrounded by many volcanoes that were ground down by later Ice Age glaciers which provided the fertile soil that contributed to Condover becoming a successful farming community throughout medieval times.Geology of Shropshire There are still several active geological fault lines underlying the area and on 2 April 1990 Condover experienced an earthquake, measuring 5.4 on the Richter Scale, centred on Bishop's Castle on the Welsh border. =Sandstone quarrying and gravel sink holes= There are many small sand and gravel quarries located around the village, although the area is still very rural. In one of the many gravel bog sink holes near Bomere Pool the bones of a woolly mammoth were discovered in 1986. The skeleton is one of the most complete mammoth skeletons ever to be found in the UK and has been dated at 14,000 years old, later than the animals had been previously thought to survive in Europe. There is a model of the Condover mammoth skeleton at the Shropshire Hills Discovery Centre in Craven Arms, along with a reconstruction of how it might have lived. Next to Bomere Pool is a secluded traditional forest of about , woodland that once formed part of Bayston Hill and Condover royal forest. Transport =Bus route= Minsterley Motors route 435 (Shrewsbury-Ludlow) runs through and calls at the village.Minsterley Motors 435 Service =Cycle route= Regional Cycle Route 32/33 passes through the village, on its way from Betton Strange to Great Ryton. Railways The Welsh Marches Line runs through the currently closed Condover railway station on the section without any intermediate stations between Shrewsbury railway station and Church Stretton railway station. Education =Primary= The village has its own primary school, Condover Primary School, a Church of England co-educational school with 109 pupils aged 5‚Äì11. =Secondary= There is no secondary school in the village; children over the age of eleven travel by bus to a range of secondary schools in nearby Meole Brace, Shrewsbury or Church Stretton and the sixth-form college in Shrewsbury. Parish church The Church of England parish church of SS Andrew and Mary dates from the 12th century and is cruciform. The late Norman windows have keeled nook-shafts and waterleaf capitals, resting on a continuous string course. The church is built of finely grained local pink sandstone, quarried at Berriefield, with some recycled Roman stones, presumably robbed from a local derelict farmhouse or villa. The replacement nave dates from 1664 after the rebuilding of the crossing tower, which collapsed in 1660 also destroying the northern aisle. A master mason called John Orum cut his initials (reading apparently \\"I.O.\\") into the northern jamb of the double-chamfered tower arch in 1664. The three-stage western tower was added in 1678 but has a medieval appearance. The chancel was rebuilt in 1868 by Lord of the Manor, Reginald Cholmondeley of Condover Hall who also added the northern family chapel. The northern porch, south vestry together with battlements and buttresses to the nave were built during an 1878 restoration by Fairfax Blomfield Wade-Palmer. Stained-glass windows were added in 1868, in 1881 and latterly in 1905 with a four pane Infancy of Christ by J.H. Powell.Church History The churchyard contains one of the finest collections of church monuments in Shropshire, the earliest from the 16th century. Most of these monuments and family tombs date from the 18th and 19th centuries. Many of the sculptures and monuments are listed. There are a few war-related memorials: *Brass plaque (north wall) to Private John Beddall, King's Shropshire Light Infantry, died on active service in South Africa during Boer War in 1901. *Portland stone tablet on north-east wall of nave to \\"the eighteen (sic) men\\" of the parish who died serving in World War I - the names listed include one woman, Katherine Harley (nurse, died in Serbia). *Brass plaque (north wall) to Flight Lieutenant Eric Lock DSO DFC & Bar RAF (1919-1941), who failed to return from operations on 3 August 1941. * A World War II Roll of Honour at the front of the church The churchyard contains a Commonwealth war grave headstone to a Royal Warwickshire Regiment soldier of World War I.

Literary career  Her debut novel, The Company She Keeps, received critical acclaim as a succ√®s de scandale, depicting the social milieu of New York intellectuals of the late 1930s with unreserved frankness. After building a reputation as a satirist and critic, McCarthy enjoyed popular success when the 1963 edition of her novel The Group remained on the New York Times Best Seller list for almost two years. Her work is noted for its precise prose and its complex mixture of autobiography and fiction. Randall Jarrell's 1954 novel Pictures from an Institution is said to be about McCarthy's year teaching at Sarah Lawrence. Her feud with fellow writer Lillian Hellman formed the basis for the play Imaginary Friends by Nora Ephron. The feud had simmered since the late 1930s over ideological differences, particularly the questions of the Moscow Trials and of Hellman's support for the \\"Popular Front\\" with Stalin. McCarthy provoked Hellman in 1979 when she famously said on The Dick Cavett Show: \\"every word [Hellman] writes is a lie, including 'and' and 'the'.\\" Hellman responded by filing a $2.5 million libel suit against McCarthy, which ended shortly after Hellman died in 1984. Observers of the trial noted the resulting irony of Hellman's defamation suit is that it brought significant scrutiny, and decline of Hellman's reputation, by forcing McCarthy and her supporters to prove that she had lied. Although she broke ranks with some of her Partisan Review colleagues when they swerved toward conservative politics after World War II, she carried on lifelong friendships with Dwight Macdonald, Nicola Chiaromonte, Philip Rahv, F. W. Dupee and Elizabeth Hardwick. Perhaps most prized of all was her close friendship with Hannah Arendt, with whom she maintained a sizable correspondence widely regarded for its intellectual rigor. After Arendt's passing, McCarthy became Arendt's literary executor from 1976 until her own death in 1989. McCarthy taught at Bard College from 1946 to 1947, and once again between 1986 and 1989. She also taught a winter semester in 1948 at Sarah Lawrence College.  Beliefs as an adult  McCarthy left the Catholic Church as a young woman when she became an atheist. In her contrarian fashion, McCarthy treasured her religious education for the classical foundation it provided her intellect while at the same time she depicted her loss of faith and her contests with religious authority as essential to her character. In New York, she moved in \\"fellow-traveling\\" Communist circles early in the 1930s, but by the latter half of the decade she repudiated Soviet-style Communism, expressing solidarity with Leon Trotsky after the Moscow Trials, and vigorously countering playwrights and authors she considered to be sympathetic to Stalinism. As part of the Partisan Review circle and as a contributor to The Nation, The New Republic, Harper's Magazine, and The New York Review of Books, she garnered attention as a cutting critic, advocating the necessity for creative autonomy that transcends doctrine. During the 1940s and 1950s she became a liberal critic of both McCarthyism and Communism. She maintained her commitment to liberal critiques of culture and power to the end of her life, opposing the Vietnam War in the 1960s and covering the Watergate scandal hearings in the 1970s.  Opposition to Vietnam War In 1967 and 1968, McCarthy travelled to North and South Vietnam, to report on the war from an anti-war perspective.Robert Trumbull, \\"2 Novelists Tell of Visit to Hanoi: Mary McCarthy Found Foe Confident of Winning,\\" N.Y. Times, Apr. 8, 1968, https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/04/08/88936296.html?pageNumber=3 She documented her observations in two books, Vietnam, and Hanoi.Mary McCarthy, Vietnam (1967); Mary McCarthy, Hanoii (1968). Interviewed after her first trip, she declared on British television that there was not a single documented case of the Viet Cong deliberately killing a South Vietnamese woman or child. She wrote favorably about the Viet Cong. McCarthy visited North Vietnam in March 1968, only a month after the Tet Offensive created havoc in South Vietnam. In her book, Hanoi, McCarthy provides a rare English-language description of life in North Vietnam during Vietnam's war with the United States. McCarthy describes an orderly society, in which everyone pitched in to help with the war effort. North Vietnam received advance warning of most bombing attacks, and McCarthy regularly had to take cover from American bombs.Mary McCarthy, Hanoii (1968). McCarthy's visits to Vietnam generated some controversy. During her visit to North Vietnam, McCarthy met briefly with U.S. Air Force officer James Risner, who was being held as a prisoner of war by North Vietnam at the time. Years later, after his release, Risner attacked McCarthy as not having recognized that he had been tortured by the North Vietnamese while in custody. Awards McCarthy was the winner of the Horizon Prize in 1949,The Montogomery Fellows Program. \\"Mary McCarthy.\\" Dartmouth College, 2017. Retrieved 11 October 2017. and was awarded two Guggenheim fellowships in 1949 and 1959. She was a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the American Academy in Rome. In 1973, she delivered the Huizinga Lecture in Leiden, the Netherlands, under the title Can There Be a Gothic Literature? The same year she was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She won the National Medal for Literature and the Edward MacDowell Medal in 1984. McCarthy held honorary degrees from Bard, Bowdoin, Colby, Smith College, Syracuse University, the University of Maine at Orono, the University of Aberdeen, and the University of Hull.  Personal life Born in Seattle, Washington, to Roy Winfield McCarthy and his wife, the former Martha Therese Preston, McCarthy was orphaned at the age of six when both her parents died in the flu epidemic of 1918. She and her brothers, Kevin, Preston, and Sheridan, were raised in very unhappy circumstances by her Catholic father's parents in Minneapolis, Minnesota, under the direct care of an uncle and aunt she remembered for harsh treatment and abuse. When the situation became intolerable, she was taken in by her maternal grandparents in Seattle. Her maternal grandmother, Augusta Morganstern, was Jewish, and her maternal grandfather, Harold Preston, a prominent attorney and co-founder of the law firm Preston Gates & Ellis, was Presbyterian. (Her brothers were sent to boarding school.) McCarthy credited her grandfather, who helped draft one of the nation's first Workmen's Compensation Acts, with helping form her liberal views. McCarthy explores the complex events of her early life in Minneapolis and her coming of age in Seattle in her memoir, Memories of a Catholic Girlhood. Her younger brother, actor Kevin McCarthy, went on to star in such movies as Death of a Salesman (1951) and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956). Under the guardianship of the Prestons, McCarthy studied at the Forest Ridge School of the Sacred Heart in Seattle and Annie Wright Seminary in Tacoma, and went on to graduate in 1933 with an A.B. cum laude from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. She married four times. In 1933 she married Harald Johnsrud, an actor and would-be playwright. Her best-known spouse was the writer and critic Edmund Wilson, whom she married in 1938 after leaving her lover Philip Rahv, and with whom she had a son, Reuel Wilson. In 1946 she married Bowden Broadwater, who worked for the New Yorker. In 1961, McCarthy married career diplomat James R. West. Death McCarthy died of lung cancer on October 25, 1989, at NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital in New York City. Film portrayals In the 2012 German movie Hannah Arendt, Mary McCarthy is portrayed by Janet McTeer.

Jonas Hanway (12 August 1712 ‚Äì 5 September 1786), was an English traveller and philanthropist. Life He was born in Portsmouth, on the south coast of England. Whilst still a child, his father, who had been a victualler, died, and the family subsequently moved to London. In 1729, Jonas was apprenticed to a merchant in Lisbon. In 1743, after he had been in business for himself for some time in London, he became a partner with Mr Dingley, a merchant in St Petersburg, and in this way was led to travel in Russia and Persia. Leaving St Petersburg on 10 September 1743, and passing south by Moscow, Tsaritsyn and Astrakhan, he embarked on the Caspian Sea on 22 November and arrived at Astrabad on 18 December. Here his goods were seized by Mohammed Hassan Beg, and it was only after great privations that he reached the camp of Nadir Shah, under whose protection he recovered most (85%) of his property. His return journey was embarrassed by sickness (at Resht), attacks from pirates, and six weeks' quarantine; he only arrived at St Petersburg on 1 January 1745. He again left the Russian capital on 9 July 1750 and travelled through Germany and the Netherlands to England (28 October). The rest of his life was mostly spent in London, where the narrative of his travels (published in 1753) soon made him a man of note, and where he devoted himself to philanthropy and good citizenship. In 1756, Hanway founded The Marine Society, to keep up the supply of British seamen; in 1758, he became a governor of the Foundling Hospital, a position which was upgraded to vice president in 1772; he was instrumental in the establishment the Magdalen Hospital; in 1761 he procured a better system of parochial birth registration in London; and in 1762 he was appointed a commissioner for victualling the navy (10 July); this office he held till October 1783. He died, unmarried, on 5 September 1786 and was buried in the crypt at St. Mary's Church, Hanwell. A monument to his memory, sculpted by John Francis Moore was erected in Westminster Abbey in 1786.Dictionary of British Sculptors, 1660-1851 Hanway was the first male Londoner, it is said, to carry an umbrella, (following women who had been using umbrellas since 1705) and he lived to triumph over all the hackney coachmen who tried to hoot and hustle him down.William John Thoms, John Doran, Henry Frederick Turle, Joseph Knight, Vernon Horace Rendall, Florence Hayllar (1850) Notes and Queries: Umbrellas.

He attacked vail-giving, or tipping, with some temporary success; by his onslaught upon tea-drinking he became involved in controversy with Johnson and Goldsmith. His last efforts were on behalf little chimney-sweeps.

Of literary importance is the Historical Account of British Trade over the Caspian Sea, with a Journal of Travels, etc. (London, 1753).

History  As long ago as 500 BC the area was inhabited by Ojibway Natives who lived along the Pic River and there are still their descendants living in the area today. Marathon was born as a railway community named Peninsula, due to its location on a peninsula on Lake Superior. Constructing the railway, between 1881 and 1883, over the region's terrain was a great engineering feat. At the time of the construction, some 12,000 men and 5,000 horses worked out of the town. It has been said, but not verified, that certain sections of track would be laid one day, only to be devoured by the earth the next. Like most railway communities, once the railway had been completed Peninsula's population dwindled considerably, and by 1935, the census of the town was just 23. It wasn't until a pulp mill was constructed in town, between 1944 and 1946, that the population rose back to 2,500, and the town's name was changed, first to Everest - after D.C. Everest, president of Marathon Corporation of Wisconsin, owners of the pulp mill in the town - then, later the same year, to Marathon, in honour of the paper company. The Everest name was discarded due to sounding too close to Everett, Ontario. Marathon Corporation operated the mill for eleven years before the company was acquired by American Can Company in 1957. The Marathon mill operated under the name American Can of Canada Limited for over 25 years. Then James River Corporation, which had purchased American Can's US-based towel and tissue division in late 1981, entered into a joint venture with Buchanan Forest Products to create James River-Marathon Ltd. that purchased the mill in April 1983. In May 1997, James River Corporation merged with Fort Howard Corporation and the Marathon mill became Fort James-Marathon Ltd. Finally, in January 2000, Fort James sold Marathon to a 50/50 joint venture of Tembec and Kruger, creating Marathon Pulp Inc. In the early 1980s, gold was discovered at Hemlo, an uninhabited area adjacent to the Trans Canada highway some east of Marathon. By the late 1980s, three mines were running at Hemlo, with two of the three mines locating their employees in Marathon, which effectively doubled its population making it the largest town along the North Shore between Sault Ste. Marie and Thunder Bay. Geography Personal residences encompass an area starting from Lake Superior, and stretch out to a new subdivision near Penn Lake, an in-town campsite and beach in the eastern portion of the town. The Pic River is outside of the town's eastern limits. The town is adjacent to Peninsula Harbour and has several coves including Carden Cove, Sturdee Cove and Craddock Cove; all three are west-northwest of Marathon. Penn Lake is a local lake within the town where tourists can enjoy camping and water sports. Heron Bay is a town located to the south of Marathon, and shares the post office and phone prefix. The Pic River First Nation is on the outskirts of Pukaskwa National Park. Demographics Economy and transportation Marathon's resource economy was built on pulp, most recently managed by Marathon Pulp Inc. On February 12, 2009, Marathon Pulp Inc. announced an indefinite shutdown that eliminated hundreds of jobs from the region, and negatively impacted Marathon's tax base and its local economy. Starting in the mid-1980s Marathon's economy expanded to include gold mining. The Hemlo Operations included three gold mining operations: Williams, David Bell and Golden Giant mines. In 2009, Vancouver-based Teck Cominco mining company sold its 50% share of Williams and David Bell to its investing partner, Barrick Gold Corporation, while Golden Giant was decommissioned in 2005. Golden Giant mine is now owned by Barrick Gold Corporation, and is now part of David Bell mine. Marathon is the centre of commerce for the rural region in which it is situated. It boasts the largest indoor shopping mall between Thunder Bay and Sault Ste. Marie, and one of only three Canadian Tire department stores in the region. Marathon is located west of Trans Canada Highway 17, to which it is connected via Peninsula Road (formerly Highway 626). The town is served by the Canadian Pacific Railway and a geographically important airport (Marathon Aerodrome) just north of the Trans-Canada Highway, approximately northeast of the town. Education Marathon is served by five schools. Three of these are public schools: Margaret Twomey Public School, Marathon High School, and √âcole Secondaire Cit√©-Sup√©rieure. Two are Roman Catholic separate schools: Holy Saviour School and √âcole Val-des-Bois. Recreation and tourism Marathon has a children's park named after Del Earle, one of the town's founders. There are numerous hotels in the town, including Travelodge, Harbour Inn and the Zero 100 Motor Inn. Marathon has a challenging 9 hole golf course, Cross-country skiing trails and down hill skiing (now closed), a 4-sheet curling venue (now closed), and the only indoor swimming pool between Thunder Bay and Sault Ste. Marie. Recent developments in the town include a new skatepark, basketball courts and the refinishing of the tennis courts. Culture and the arts Marathon's art and culture community has varied over time. Marathon has been home to a community entertainment series, a community choir, coffee houses & culture jams, a writer's group, an art gallery, house concerts, frequent dinner theatres, art and photography displays, quilting groups and shows, a ceramics club, annual craft shows, and numerous art classes. A summer music series, known as \\"Concerts in the Parking Lot\\", was inaugurated in July 2006 and is held in the town centre on Wednesday evenings in summer. This casual series encompasses a variety of musical genres, and showcases talent both local and from \\"away\\". In 2010, Marathon was one of the many Canadian communities that the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics Torch Relay passed through.  Community groups and services  Marathon is served by numerous organizations and services. These include, among many others, the Cub Scouts, Salvation Army, Girl Guides, Victim Services, and the Royal Canadian Air Cadets. Climate Marathon has a warm-summer humid continental climate (K√∂ppen: Dfb), with its position north of Lake Superior the climate is attenuated, mainly the southern heatwaves, due to the hot air masses already have crossing the entire lake. It is noted differences with Thunder Bay, for example, keeping winters still rigorous but warm summers and sometimes cool.

The protocol was negotiated by U.S. Senator Tom Harkin and U.S. Representative Eliot Engel in response to a documentary and multiple articles in 2000 and 2001 reporting widespread child slavery and child trafficking in the production of cocoa. The protocol was signed in September 2001. Joint Statements in 2001, 2005 and 2008 and a Joint Declaration in 2010 extended the commitment to address the problem. The industry's pledge to reduce child labor in Ivory Coast and Ghana by 70%, as per the Protocol, had not been met as of late 2015; the deadline was again extended, to 2020. Background Sen. Tom Harkin Rep. Eliot Engel In late 2000 a BBC documentary reported the use of enslaved children in the production of cocoa‚Äîthe main ingredient in chocolate‚Äî in West Africa.Wolfe and Shazzie, p. 98 Other media followed by reporting widespread child slavery and child trafficking in the production of cocoa. The cocoa industry was accused of profiting from child slavery and trafficking.Payson 2010, p. 26 The European Cocoa Association dismissed these accusations as \\"false and excessive\\" and the industry said the reports were not representative of all areas. Later the industry acknowledged the working conditions for children were unsatisfactory and children's rights were sometimes violatedPayson 2010, pp. 26‚Äì7 and acknowledged the claims could not be ignored. In 2001, US Representative Eliot Engel introduced a legislative amendment to an agriculture bill. This amendment was to give the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) $250,000 to develop a label to indicate no child slave labor was used in growing or harvesting cocoa; this label would be similar to the \\"dolphin safe\\" labels used for tuna. The amendment was approved in the House of Representatives vote of 291‚Äì115.Payson 2011, p. 13 The bill appeared to have similar support in the Senate. The international cocoa industry strongly opposed it and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association hired former senators George Mitchell and Bob Dole to lobby against it. The cocoa industry faced potential consumer boycotts and harmful legislation if the bill were to pass. Mitchell and Dole encouraged the industry to make a deal, and before the bill went to a vote in the Senate, the cocoa industry agreed to address the problem without legislation. Senator Tom Harkin and Engel negotiated a deal with the cocoa industry to create the Harkin‚ÄìEngel Protocol. The protocol was signed in September 2001 with the objective to eliminate the \\"worst forms of child labor\\" and adult forced labor on cocoa farms in West Africa. It was signed and witnessed by the heads of eight major chocolate companies, Harkin, Engel, Senator Herb Kohl, the ambassador of C√¥te d'Ivoire, the director of the International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labor, and others. Protocol and 2001 Joint Statement The Harkin‚ÄìEngel Protocol is a voluntary public-private agreement to eliminate the worst forms of child labor (defined according to the International Labour Organization (ILO)'s Convention 182) in the growth and processing of cocoa in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire and Ghana.Payson 2011, p. 7 The protocol was a voluntary agreement that partnered governments, the global cocoa industry, cocoa producers, cocoa laborers, non-governmenal organizations. The agreement laid out a series of date-specific actions, including the development of voluntary standards of public certification. The Protocol did not commit the industry to ending all child labor in cocoa production, only the worst forms of it. The parties agreed to a six-article plan: # Public statement of the need for and terms of an action plan‚ÄîThe cocoa industry acknowledged the problem of forced child labor and will commit \\"significant resources\\" to address the problem. # Formation of multi-sectoral advisory groups‚ÄîBy 1 October 2001, an advisory group will be formed to research labor practices. By 1 December 2001, industry will form an advisory group and formulate appropriate remedies to address the worst forms of child labor. # Signed joint statement on child labor to be witnessed at the ILO‚ÄîBy 1 December 2001, a statement must be made recognizing the need to end the worst forms of child labor and identify developmental alternatives for the children removed from labor. # Memorandum of cooperation‚ÄîBy 1 May 2002, Establish a joint action program of research, information exchange, and action to enforce standards to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Establish a monitor and compliance with the standards. # Establish a joint foundation‚ÄîBy 1 July 2002, industry will form a foundation to oversee efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. It will perform field projects and be a clearinghouse on best practices. # Building toward credible standards‚ÄîBy 1 July 2005, the industry will develop and implement industry-wide standards of public certification that cocoa has been grown without any of the worst forms of child labor. A 2001 Joint Statement extended the protocol to also identify and eliminate forced labor (defined according to ILO Convention 29) in the production of cocoa.Payson 2011, pp. 100‚Äì2 The protocol laid out a non-binding agreement for the cocoa industry to regulate itself without any legal implications, but Engel threatened to reintroduce legislation if the deadlines were not met. This agreement was one of the first times an American industry was subjected to self-regulation and one of the first times self-regulation was used to address an international human rights issue. 2005 progress and Joint Statement By July 2005‚Äîthe deadline date‚Äîthe cocoa industry made progress on their goal to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Most of the requirements were achieved by the deadline.Payson 2007, p. 21 Before the protocol was signed, the cocoa industry acknowledged the problem of forced child labor to address part of Article 1. A Joint Statement was made in 2001 to address part of Article 3.Payson 2011, pp. 100‚Äì2 The International Cocoa Initiative (ICI) was established in 2002 to address part of Article 5. Through the ICI, $3 million was spent on pilot projects.Payson 2007, pp. 105‚Äì16 The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) was assigned to survey West Africans about children in cocoa production. Pilot projects were formed to monitor child labor.Payson 2011, pp. 107‚Äì9 In 2004, the cocoa industry created and funded Verification Working Group. The funding was discontinued in 2006, but another company was contracted to perform verification in 2007.Payson 2007, p. 9 But all the protocol requirements were not met by the deadline. The cocoa industry failed to create and implement an industry-wide certification standard to indicate that cocoa had not been produced with the worst forms of child labor. The chocolate companies were criticized for executing the protocol at the smallest cost, remaining mostly hands-off in the process without changing the process, and maintaining a business model dependent on child labor. More importantly, they did not alter the price of chocolate to enable the cocoa producers to end the practice of slavery. One of the major obstacles to executing the protocol was the Ivorian Civil War. Along with diamonds and timber, cocoa was a conflict resource that made money for the militants. By July 2005 the extent of child involvement in cocoa production was unclear. It was also unclear if the cocoa industry's efforts were helping the problem.Payson 2007, p. 13 On 1 July 2005, all the parties agreed to an extension of the protocol through a Joint Statement.Payson 2010, p. 28 The 2005 Joint Statement gave the cocoa industry three more years to implement the protocol. The Joint Statement stated industry would form a certification system for half of the growing regions in C√¥te d'Ivoire and Ghana. The Joint Statement also stated industry would support programs for the local cocoa-growing communities including teacher training programs. The US Congress was not satisfied with the cocoa industry's response. It gave responsibility to the US Department of Labor to find a university contractor to oversee the efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In 2006, a $4.3 million contract was awarded to the Payson Center for International Development at Tulane University through 2009.Payson 2011, pp. 13‚Äì4 In 2006, the Payson Center reported progress had been made, but children were still working in cocoa production, including performing dangerous tasks, and regularly miss school. The cocoa industry was criticized for a lack of certification standards and the governments of C√¥te d'Ivoire and Ghana were criticized for a lack of transparency. In 2006, the president of the World Cocoa Foundation said, \\"While progress has been made and we have learned valuable lessons, much more is required.\\" After the deadline passed, the International Labor Rights Fund filed a lawsuit in 2005 under the Alien Tort Claims Act against Nestle, Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland on behalf of three Malian children. The suit alleged the children were trafficked to C√¥te d'Ivoire, forced into slavery, and experienced frequent beatings on a cocoa plantation. In September 2010, the US District Court for the Central District of California determined corporations cannot be held liable for violations of international law and dismissed the suit. The case was appealed to the US Court of Appeals. 2008 progress and Joint Statement By the revised deadline‚Äî1 June 2008‚Äîall the objectives were still not met. Some progress had been made; for example, the cocoa industry had provided $10 million to the ICI. In 2006‚Äì07 the ICI had 17 training sessions in C√¥te d'Ivoire and 23 in Ghana to sensitize the governmental officials, police and media about child and adult labor practices. The focus of the Joint Statement was that of certification. The cocoa industry performed data collection had on 50% of the growing areas in both C√¥te d'Ivoire and Ghana. But independent verification, partially funded by industry, on those areas was not fully completed. The deadline was extended until the end of 2010. At that time, industry was required to have a full certification and independent verification.Payson 2011, pp. 111‚Äì4 All parties reaffirmed their commitment to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The cocoa industry committed to work with the governments of C√¥te d'Ivoire and Ghana to set up independent certification by the end of 2010; assist the governments to target remediation efforts based on the independent certification; and support the ICI as it expands to more local communities and provide training on safe labor practices. In 2009, cocoa from C√¥te d'Ivoire and Nigeria was added to a list of products made by forced child labor maintained by the Department of Labor.Payson 2010, p. 29 This listing stemmed from a request by Anti-Slavery International in 2004 to investigate if Ivorian cocoa should be on this list. Executive Order 13126 requires federal contractors who supply products on the list must prove they have made a good faith effort to determine if the products were produced under forced labor. Thus contractors must prove they have made a good faith effort to determine if cocoa was produced under forced labor. C√¥te d'Ivoire and Ghana were placed on the 2009 US State Department's Tier 2 Watch List for human trafficking due in part to the trafficking of children in cocoa production. In 2009 the Department of Labor awarded a second, $1.2 million contract to the Payson Center to continue the oversight through 2011. 2010 Joint Declaration and Framework of Action The 2010 Joint Declaration summarized the pledge of the Harkin‚ÄìEngel Protocol and reaffirmed the commitment to achieve the objectives of the protocol. The purpose of the framework of action was to reduce the worst forms of child labor 70% by 2020. Specifically, they were to remove children from and prevent children's involvement in the worst forms of child labor, promote sustainable livelihoods for cocoa growers, establish and implement community-based child labor monitoring systems, and continue national child labor surveys. The Joint Declaration established the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group to coordinate the activities of the framework and provide governance.Payson 2011, pp. 116‚Äì25 To achieve the goals, the governments of C√¥te d'Ivoire and Ghana must fund and conduct child labor surveys, provide remediation for children removed from the worst forms of child labor, prevent children from becoming involved in the worst forms of child labor, enforce laws to protect the children from the worst forms of child labor, and develop the infrastructure of the cocoa growing regions. The responsibility of the cocoa and chocolate industries is to continue to support the child labor surveys, support remediation efforts, provide sustainable livelihoods for the households of cocoa growers, try to ensure cocoa supply chains are using safe practices. The industries will commit $7 million over the next five years with the possibility of $3 million more for remediation activities. The responsibility of the US Department of Labor is to commit $10 million in 2010 for a multi-year program to support the framework and report on the progress of these efforts. 2011 status update Household surveys and governmental research in C√¥te d'Ivoire and Ghana showed that there were 1.8 million children working in cocoa agriculture. About 5% in C√¥te d'Ivoire and 10% in Ghana worked for pay. Children are commonly involved in hazardous work and some are still involved in the worst forms of child labor.Payson 2011, p. 7 Between 2001 and 2009, several thousand children were involved in remediation activities including in each country. These activities include withdrawal, rehabilitation, reinsertion, education and vocational training and these efforts were attributed to funding related to the Harkin‚ÄìEngel Protocol.Payson 2011, p. 8 Less than 5% of all children were exposed to activities related to the protocol. In 2011, the Payson Center reported the cocoa industry has not fully completed any of the six articles. Industry had not completed the 2005 Joint Statement commitment of certification for 50% of the growing areas in the two countries, much less the 2008 Joint Statement commitment of remediation activities in 100% of the growing areas. C√¥te d'Ivoire had only achieved remediation in 3.8% and Ghana in 31% of the growing areas.Payson 2011, p. 9 The cocoa industry still has to prove it can self- regulate. The Payson Center recommended the industry create a certification system that can assure consumers the worst forms of child labor are not used in production, create an independent verification of that certification system, implement child labor monitoring systems, and increase remediation activities to address the worst forms of child labor.Payson 2011, pp. 10‚Äì2 2015-2018 status update A study of the use of child labor in the cocoa fields, published in Fortune magazine in the U.S. in March 2016, concluded that approximately 2.1 million children in West Africa \\"still do the dangerous and physically taxing work of harvesting cocoa\\". The report suggested that it would be an uphill battle to improve the situation:{{quoteAccording to the 2015 edition of the Cocoa Barometer, a biennial report examining the economics of cocoa that's published by a consortium of nonprofits, the average farmer in Ghana in the 2013‚Äì14 growing season made just 84¬¢ per day, and farmers in Ivory Coast a mere 50¬¢. That puts them well below the World Bank's new $1.90 per day standard for extreme poverty, even if you factor in the 13% rise in the price of cocoa last year. Sona Ebai, the former secretary general of the Alliance of Cocoa Producing Countries said that eradicating child labor was an immense task and that the chocolate companies' newfound commitment to expanding the investments in cocoa communities are not quite sufficient. ... \\"Best-case scenario, we're only doing 10% of what's needed. Getting that other 90% won't be easy. ... I think child labor cannot be just the responsibility of industry to solve. I think it's the proverbial all-hands-on-deck: government, civil society, the private sector. And there, you really need leadership.\\" Reported in 2018, a 3-year pilot program - conducted by Nestl√© with 26,000 farmers mostly located in C√¥te d'Ivoire - observed a 51% decrease in the number of children doing hazardous jobs in cocoa farming. The US Department of Labor formed the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group as a public-private partnership with the governments of Ghana and C√¥te d'Ivoire to address child labor practices in the cocoa industry. The International Cocoa Initiative involving major cocoa manufacturers established the Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System intended to monitor thousands of farms in Ghana and C√¥te d'Ivoire for child labor conditions. Despite these efforts, goals to reduce child labor in West Africa by 70% before 2020 are frustrated by persistent poverty, absence of schools, expansion of cocoa farmland, and increased demand for cocoa. In April 2018, the Cocoa Barometer 2018 report on the $100-billion industry, said this about the child labor situation: \\"Not a single company or government is anywhere near reaching the sectorwide objective of the elimination of child labour, and not even near their commitments of a 70% reduction of child labour by 2020\\". A report later that year by New Food Economy stated that the Child Labour Monitoring and Remediation Systems implemented by the International Cocoa Initiative and its partners has been useful, but \\"they are currently reaching less than 20 percent of the over two million children impacted\\". Class action lawsuits in the US against companies in the cocoa industry have not achieved much success. In 2015, lawuits against Mars, Nestl√©, and Hershey‚Äôs alleged that their products' packaging failed to disclose that production may involve child slave labor. All were dismissed in 2016, although the plaintiffs filed an appeal. Nestl√©‚Äôs website, as paraphrased by Mother Jones magazine, states: The company said it had spent $5.5 million on the problem in 2016. Note too that Nestl√© had published a report in 2017 on child labour in the cocoa supply chain, Tackling Child Labour, with additional specifics as to their \\"approach to addressing this significant, complex and sensitive challenge\\".https://www.nestle.com/csv/raw-materials/nestle-cocoa-plan Tulane University professor William Bertrand, a co-author of the 2015 report, made this comment in October 2018 to a journalist working for Mother Jones: \\"We don‚Äôt think conditions have changed significantly in terms of the number of children working.\\" The publication concluded that, \\"despite some positive changes, such as an increase in the amount of finished chocolate sold in the Ivory Coast and Ghana ‚Äî keeping more of the profits in the local economy ‚Äî and the introduction of free primary education in the Ivory Coast, broad change is still elusive\\". Criticism In 2001, the Child Labor Coalition, a collection of advocacy groups focusing on child labor issues in the US and worldwide, criticized the protocol for only addressing C√¥te d'Ivoire and Ghana. It suggested extending the protocol to the whole world, because exploitative practices were also reported in the cocoa industries in Brazil and Indonesia. The Child Labor Coalition also recommended that the chocolate industry set the price of chocolate so that the producers make enough money to fairly compensate their workers. In 2011, ten years after implementation, it was unclear if the protocol had any effect in reducing child labor. One Payson Center researcher claimed few of the protocol commitments have been implemented, but the ICI claimed five of the six articles have been completed and they are actively working on the sixth. In 2012, , creator of the award- winning documentary, The Dark Side of Chocolate, claimed the protocol is just ‚Äúa document and politics‚Äù because there has been no progress. He thinks that the same issues will be present in five years and that changes will not come through the protocol, but instead from consumers who demand change. Notes The protocol is formally called \\"Protocol for the Growing and Processing of Cocoa Beans and Their Derivative Products In a Manner that Complies with ILO Convention 182 Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor.\\" It has also been reported that this vote was 107‚Äì76,Payson 2010, p. 27 but the final Payson report has the result as 291‚Äì115.

Use An ansatz is the establishment of the starting equation(s), the theorem(s), or the value(s) describing a mathematical or physical problem or solution. It typically provides an initial estimate or framework to the solution of a mathematical problem, and can also take into consideration the boundary conditions (in fact, an ansatz is sometimes thought of as a \\"trial answer\\" and an important technique in solving differential equations). After an ansatz, which constitutes nothing more than an assumption, has been established, the equations are solved more precisely for the general function of interest, which then constitutes a confirmation of the assumption. In essence, an ansatz makes assumptions about the form of the solution to a problem‚Äîso as to make the solution easier to find. It has been demonstrated that machine learning techniques can be applied to provide initial estimates similar to those invented by humans and to discover new ones in case no ansatz is available. Examples Given a set of experimental data that looks to be clustered about a line, a linear ansatz could be made to find the parameters of the line by a least squares curve fit. Variational approximation methods use ans√§tze and then fit the parameters. Another example could be the mass, energy, and entropy balance equations that, considered simultaneous for purposes of the elementary operations of linear algebra, are the ansatz to most basic problems of thermodynamics. Another example of an ansatz is to suppose the solution of a homogeneous linear differential equation to take an exponential form, or a power form in the case of a difference equation. More generally, one can guess a particular solution of a system of equations, and test such an ansatz by directly substituting the solution into the system of equations. In many cases, the assumed form of the solution is general enough that it can represent arbitrary functions, in such a way that the set of solutions found this way is a full set of all the solutions.

It is made up of two equally important components: a network of sensors to detect tsunamis and a communications infrastructure to issue timely alarms to permit evacuation of the coastal areas. There are two distinct types of tsunami warning systems: international and regional. When operating, seismic alerts are used to instigate the watches and warnings; then, data from observed sea level height (either shore-based tide gauges or DART buoys) are used to verify the existence of a tsunami. Other systems have been proposed to augment the warning procedures; for example, it has been suggested that the duration and frequency content of t-wave energy (which is earthquake energy trapped in the ocean SOFAR channel) is indicative of an earthquake's tsunami potential.Salzberg, 2006 History and forecasting The first rudimentary system to alert communities of an impending tsunami was attempted in Hawaii in the 1920s. More advanced systems were developed in the wake of the April 1, 1946 (caused by the 1946 Aleutian Islands earthquake) and May 23, 1960 (caused by the 1960 Valdivia earthquake) tsunamis which caused massive devastation in Hilo, Hawaii. While tsunamis travel at between 500 and 1,000 km/h (around 0.14 and 0.28 km/s) in open water, earthquakes can be detected almost at once as seismic waves travel with a typical speed of 4 km/s (around 14,400 km/h). This gives time for a possible tsunami forecast to be made and warnings to be issued to threatened areas, if warranted. Until a reliable model is able to predict which earthquakes will produce significant tsunamis, this approach will produce many more false alarms than verified warnings. International systems (IS) =Pacific Ocean= Japanese Tsunami warning sign Tsunami warnings (SAME code: TSW) for most of the Pacific Ocean are issued by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC), operated by the United States NOAA in Ewa Beach, Hawaii. NOAA's National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC) in Palmer, Alaska issues warnings for North America, including Alaska, British Columbia, Oregon, California, the Gulf of Mexico, and the East coast. The PTWC was established in 1949, following the 1946 Aleutian Island earthquake and a tsunami that resulted in 165 casualties on Hawaii and in Alaska; NTWC was founded in 1967. International coordination is achieved through the International Coordination Group for the Tsunami Warning System in the Pacific, established by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO. In 2017, The US congressional panel passed a vote to continue funding a global tsunami detection system that gives U.S. officials an accurate forecast in order to decrease damage cause by Tsunamis. =Chile= In 2005, Chile started to implement the Integrated Plate boundary Observatory Chile (IPOC) which in the following years become a network of 14 multiparameter stations for monitoring the 600-km seismic distance between Antofagasta and Arica. Each station was provided with broadband seismometer, accelerometer, GPS antenna. In four cases, it was installed a short-base tiltmeter (pendulum). Some stations were ubicated underground at a depth of 3-4 meters. The network completed the tidal gauge of the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy. The long-base tiltmeters (LBTs) and the STS2 seismometer of the IPOC recorded a series of long-period signals some days after the 2010 Maule earthquake. The same effect was registered by broadband seismometers of India and Japan some days after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Simulations held in 2013 on historical data highlighted \\"tiltmeters and broadband seismometers are thus valuable instruments for monitoring tsunamis in complement with tide gauge arrays.\\" In the case of the 2010 Maule earthquake, tilt-sensors observed a discriminating signal \\"starting 20 min before the arrival time of the tsunami at the nearest point on the coastline.\\" =Indian Ocean (ICG/IOTWMS)= Tsunami Early Warning Tower board in Hikkaduwa, Sri Lanka After the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami which killed almost 250,000 people, a United Nations conference was held in January 2005 in Kobe, Japan, and decided that as an initial step towards an International Early Warning Programme, the UN should establish an Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System. This resulted in a warning system for Indonesia and other affected areas. Indonesia's system fell out of service in 2012 because the detection buoys were no longer operational. Tsunami prediction is therefore currently limited to detection of seismic activity; there is no system to predict tsunamis based on volcanic eruptions. Indonesia was hit by tsunamis in September and December 2018. The December 2018 tsunami was caused by a volcano. =North Eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean and Connected Seas (ICG/NEAMTWS)= The First United Session of the Inter-governmental Coordination Group for the Tsunami Early Warning and Mitigation System in the North Eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean and connected Seas (ICG/NEAMTWS), established by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO Assembly during its 23rd Session in June 2005, through Resolution XXIII.14, took place in Rome on 21 and 22 November 2005. The meeting, hosted by the Government of Italy (the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Italian Ministry for the Environment and Protection of Land and Sea), was attended by more than 150 participants from 24 countries, 13 organizations and numerous observers. =Caribbean= A Caribbean-wide tsunami warning system was planned to be instituted by the year 2010, by representatives of Caribbean nations who met in Panama City in March 2008. Panama's last major tsunami killed 4,500 people in 1882.Reuters:Caribbean plans tsunami warning system by 2010 Barbados has said it will review or test its tsunami protocol in February 2010 as a regional pilot. Regional warning systems Tsunami warning system in East Timor Regional (or local) warning system centers use seismic data about nearby recent earthquakes to determine if there is a possible local threat of a tsunami. Such systems are capable of issuing warnings to the general public (via public address systems and sirens) in less than 15 minutes. Although the epicenter and moment magnitude of an underwater quake and the probable tsunami arrival times can be quickly calculated, it is almost always impossible to know whether underwater ground shifts have occurred which will result in tsunami waves. As a result, false alarms can occur with these systems, but the disruption is small, which makes sense due to the highly localized nature of these extremely quick warnings, in combination with how difficult it would be for a false alarm to affect more than a small area of the system. Real tsunamis would affect more than just a small portion. =Japan= Japan has a nationwide tsunami warning system. The system usually issues the warning minutes after an Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) is issued, should there be expected waves. The tsunami warning was issued within 3 minutes with the most serious rating on its warning scale during the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami; it was rated as a \\"major tsunami\\", being at least 3 m (9.8 ft) high. An improved system was unveiled on March 7, 2013 following the 2011 disaster to better access the waves. Conveying the warning Mast with warning system, and sign detailing escape routes, on the coast of Okumatsushima, Miyagi prefecture, Japan (this coast was severely hit by the 2011 tsunami) Detection and prediction of tsunamis is only half the work of the system. Of equal importance is the ability to warn the populations of the areas that will be affected. All tsunami warning systems feature multiple lines of communications (such as Cell Broadcast, SMS, e-mail, fax, radio, texting and telex, often using hardened dedicated systems) enabling emergency messages to be sent to the emergency services and armed forces, as well to population- alerting systems (e.g. sirens) and systems like the Emergency Alert System. Shortcomings With the speed at which tsunami waves travel through open water, no system can protect against a very sudden tsunami, where the coast in question is too close to the epicenter. A devastating tsunami occurred off the coast of Hokkaid≈ç in Japan as a result of an earthquake on July 12, 1993. As a result, 202 people on the small island of Okushiri, Hokkaido lost their lives, and hundreds more were missing or injured. This tsunami struck just three to five minutes after the quake, and most victims were caught while fleeing for higher ground and secure places after surviving the earthquake. This was also the case in Aceh, Indonesia. While there remains the potential for sudden devastation from a tsunami, warning systems can be effective. For example, if there were a very large subduction zone earthquake (moment magnitude 9.0) off the west coast of the United States, people in Japan, would therefore have more than 12 hours (and likely warnings from warning systems in Hawaii and elsewhere) before any tsunami arrived, giving them some time to evacuate areas likely to be affected.

His company put together the nation's first central electrocardiographic system at Northwestern University Medical School. This machine has since become standard in hospitals throughout the United States. The company was also noted for having one of the first on-site day care centers in the nation. In 1982, he and Warren bought the failing Patient Monitoring Business Unit from GE (then known as General Electric Medical Systems Division) and combined it with the existing business (primarily diagnostic equipment). In 1998, he sold Marquette Electronics (by then known as Marquette Medical Systems) to GE.

History He followed Orso I Participazio and Giovanni II Participazio as Doge of Venice, elected to the throne at the side of the elderly, and beloved, Giovanni circa April 887. He launched a military attempt against the Narentines in Dalmatia, who were hostile to Venetia after 886. As soon as he became Doge, he advanced with a fleet of twelve galleys to the port of Makarska (), where he sank five Narentine ships. He landed near Mokro and advanced deeper inland, but the Narentines crushed his forces, killing him in open battle on 18 September 887. Harry Hearder, Jonathan Morris, Italy: a short history, pg. 61, Cambridge University Press (2002), He was the first Doge to die in a battle for La Serenissima (Italian for The Most Serene, referring to the Republic of Venice). Following his death, the Venetians began to pay prince Branimir of Croatia (879‚Äì892) an annual tribute for the right to travel and trade in the Croatian part of the Adriatic; between Pietro's death in 887 and 948, no new war was recorded with the Croats, which is thought to show they paid tribute to maintain the peace.

Its name originally comes from Kreditanstalt f√ºr Wiederaufbau (\\"Credit Institute for Reconstruction\\"). It was formed in 1948 after World War II as part of the Marshall Plan. As of 2018, it is Germany‚Äôs third largest bank by balance sheet.  Governance  KfW is owned by the Federal Republic of Germany (80 percent) and the States of Germany (20 percent). It is led by a five-member Executive Board headed by CEO Dr. G√ºnther Br√§unig, which in turn reports to a 36member Board of Supervisory Directors. The Chair and Deputy Chair of the Board of Supervisory Directors are the German Federal Ministers of Finance and of Economic Affairs, with the positions alternating annually between them. The chairman as of March 2018 is Peter Altmaier, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy. In 2009, Caisse des D√©pots, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, KfW and European Investment Bank founded the Long-Term Investors Club.  Operations  KfW banking group covers over 90% of its borrowing needs in the capital markets, mainly through bonds that are guaranteed by the federal government. This allows KfW to raise funds at advantageous conditions. Its exemption from having to pay corporate taxes due to its legal status as a public agency and unremunerated equity provided by its public shareholders allow KfW to provide loans for purposes prescribed by the KfW law at lower rates than commercial banks. KfW is not allowed to compete with commercial banks, but it facilitates their business in areas within its mandate. KfW banking group has three business units with distinct functions, as well as several subsidiaries. Lending by KfW group‚Äôs two main business units, accounting for more than 90% of total lending, is in Germany and, to a limited extent, in other European countries. However, its largest subsidiary, KfW IPEX-Bank GmbH, predominantly lends internationally. A smaller subsidiary, the German Investment Corporation (DEG), and one of the group‚Äôs smaller business units, KfW Development Bank, are exclusively active in the international arena, each within their particular business areas.  Subsidiaries and group units  = Housing and environment = KfW F√∂rderbank (KfW promotional Bank), the largest business unit of the group, committed ‚Ç¨47.6 billion in 2014, mostly for housing and environmental protection in Germany.KfW Bankengruppe:Key Business Figures. It is especially active in promoting energy-efficient housing for owner-occupied houses as well as for landlords, both for new houses and refurbishments. Its energy efficiency standards for houses (KfW-60 and KfW-40) have become accepted standards in Germany. Concerning environmental protection, it promotes, among others, photovoltaic energy (solar cells) which has in turn received massive indirect subsidies through feed-in tariffshttp://www.qualenergia.it/articoli/20150407-batterie-il-fotovotaico- come-sta-andando-l-incentivo-germania under the Renewable Energy Law of 2000. It also invests in municipal infrastructure such as public transport and sanitation through a sub-unit called KfW Kommunalbank (KfW municipal bank). More recently (since 2006), it has also engaged in education where it provides student loans. = Small and medium enterprises = KfW Mittelstandsbank (which roughly translates as KfW small and medium enterprises bank), the second largest business unit of the group, provides assistance to German small and medium enterprises (SMEs) including individual entrepreneurs and start- ups. In addition to loans it also provides equity and mezzanine financing. Its financing totaled ‚Ç¨20.4 billion in 2015. https://www.kfw.de/Presse- Newsroom/Pressetermine/Jahresauftakt-Pressekonferenz-2016/KfW-Foerderzahlen- per-2015.pdf KfW has been very active in securitization before this market collapsed during the subprime mortgage crisis. Through securitization it helped commercial banks to transfer risks from their housing and SME portfolios to the capital market. KfW also provides loans to European commercial banks to help them finance SMEs, housing and infrastructure (so- called global loans). = Development aid = KfW Entwicklungsbank (KfW Development Bank) provides financing to governments, public enterprises and commercial banks engaged in microfinance and SME promotion in developing countries. It does so through loans close to market terms using its own resources (\\"promotional loans\\"), soft loans that blend KfW resources with support from the federal government's aid budget (\\"development loans\\"), as well as highly subsidized loans and grants, the latter two coming entirely from the federal aid budget. Different country groups are offered different financing conditions depending mainly on their per capita income. All these financing instruments are part of what is officially called development cooperation and is more commonly called \\"development aid\\". In German aid, the work of KfW Development Bank is called \\"financial cooperation\\" which is complemented by \\"technical cooperation\\" by GIZ and other public agencies. The main sectors of financial cooperation are water supply and sanitation, renewable energy and energy efficiency, as well as the development of the financial sector. KfW Development Bank also works, among other sectors, in health, education, agriculture, forestry, solid waste management. It provided ‚Ç¨7.4 billion in loans and grants in 2014. = Export and project finance = The largest subsidiary of KfW banking group is KfW IPEX-Bank. KfW IPEX-Bank is active in project finance and corporate finance related to German or European exports. It also promotes foreign investments in Germany. Unlike KfW, it competes directly with commercial banks. Therefore, and in response to concerns voiced by the European Commission concerning unfair competition, KfW IPEX-Bank has become legally and financially independent in 2008. KfW IPEX- Bank's main sectors of activity are ports, airports, toll roads, bridges and tunnels, railways, ships, planes, telecommunications, energy, and manufacturing. In 2014 the balance sheet total of KfW IPEX-Bank amounted to ‚Ç¨26.3 billion. Another subsidiary of KfW banking group, the German Investment Corporation (DEG), takes minority equity stakes and provides loans to private companies investing in developing countries. It pursues a business model broadly similar to that of the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank Group. Its main sectors of activity are banking, agro-business, renewable energy, telecommunications and manufacturing. It lent 1.2 billion in 2008. = State shareholding = On behalf of the German state, KfW holds shares in a variety of corporations, including Deutsche Post, Deutsche Telekom,Mark Landler (October 12, 2004), New York Times.

Biography Haag was born in Erlangen, in the Kingdom of Bavaria, and was trained in the Academy of Fine Arts Nuremberg and at Munich. He initially practised as an illustrator and as a painter in oils of portraits and architectural subjects; but in 1847 he settled in England, where he studied English watercolour techniques. After this he devoted himself to watercolours. In 1850 was elected an associate of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours before becoming a full member in 1853. He also enjoyed the patronage of Queen Victoria. Between 1858 and 1860, he travelled to the Middle East, at first staying for more than a year in Cairo where he shared a studio with artist, Frederick Goodall. Later he journeyed to Jerusalem, Lebanon and Syria before returning to Cairo. During this period, he made many sketches which he worked up into paintings after returning to London. He returned to Egypt in 1873-74 to gather inspiration for further Oriental paintings.Khatib, H., Palestine and Egypt Under the Ottomans: Paintings, Books, Photographs, Maps and Manuscripts, I.B.Tauris, 2003, p. 101 He was a prolific and important painter Holy Land scenes. He gained a considerable reputation for his firmly drawn and meticulously elaborated paintings of Eastern subjects. Some of his depictions of the Middle East are in the Israel Museum's collection.

Headquartered on Ford Island, HI, the PTWC is part of an international tsunami warning system (TWS) program and serves as the operational center for TWS of the Pacific issuing bulletins and warnings to participating members and other nations in the Pacific Ocean area of responsibility. It is also the regional (local) warning center for the State of Hawaii. The other tsunami warning center is the National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC) in Palmer, Alaska, serving all coastal regions of Canada and the United States except Hawaii, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. The PTWC was established in 1949, following the 1946 Aleutian Island earthquake and a tsunami that resulted in 165 casualties in Hawaii and Alaska. The PTWC uses seismic data as its starting point, but then takes into account oceanographic data when calculating possible threats. Tide gauges in the area of the earthquake are checked to establish if a tsunami has formed. The center then forecasts the future of the tsunami, issuing warnings to at-risk areas all around the Pacific basin if needed. Bulletins Depending on the seismic data, PTWC will issue the following types of bulletins: ;Tsunami Information Bulletin :At this time, though a threat exists, there is no evidence that a tsunami is making its way across the Pacific. ;Tsunami Watch :PTWC has determined the earthquake may very likely have created a tsunami and is advising parties to be alert as PTWC awaits tide data to support tsunami generation. A watch may be upgraded to an advisory or a warning. ;Tsunami Advisory :PTWC has determined the earthquake has created a tsunami with strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water. ;Tsunami Warning :PTWC finds conditions serious enough to issue immediate concern to parts of the Pacific. The message will include approximate arrival times for various parts of the Pacific. Deep-ocean tsunami detection In 1995, NOAA began developing the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) system. By 2001, an array of six stations had been deployed in the Pacific Ocean.Historical DART Background Information Beginning in 2005, as a result of the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, plans were announced to add 32 more DART buoys to be operational by mid-2007.U.S. ANNOUNCES PLAN FOR AN IMPROVED TSUNAMI DETECTION AND WARNING SYSTEM These stations give detailed information about tsunamis while they are still far off shore. Each station consists of a sea-bed bottom pressure recorder (at a depth of 1000‚Äì6000 m) which detects the passage of a tsunami and transmits the data to a surface buoy via acoustic modem. The surface buoy then radios the information to the PTWC via the GOES satellite system. The bottom pressure recorder lasts for two years while the surface buoy is replaced every year. The system has considerably improved the forecasting and warning of tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean. Final transmission Local populations in the United States of America receive tsunami information through radio and television receivers connected to the Emergency Alert System, and in some places (such as Hawaii) civil defense sirens and roving loudspeaker broadcasts from police vehicles. The public can subscribe to the RSS feed or email alerts from the PTWC web site,http://ptwc.weather.gov/ptwc/subscribe.php and the UNESCO site. Email and text messages are also available from the USGS Earthquake Notification Service which includes tsunami alerts.

There is a difference between the creation and control of charged particle beams and neutral particle beams, as only the first type can be manipulated to a sufficient extent by devices based on electromagnetism. The manipulation and diagnostics of charged particle beams at high kinetic energies using particle accelerators are main topics of accelerator physics. Sources Charged particles such as electrons, positrons, and protons may be separated from their common surrounding. This can be accomplished by e.g. thermionic emission or arc discharge. The following devices are commonly used as sources for particle beams: * Ion source * Cathode ray tube, or more specifically in one of its parts called electron gun. This is also part of traditional television and computer screens. * Photocathodes may also be built in as a part of an electron gun, using the photoelectric effect to separate particles from their substrate.T. J. Kauppila et al. (1987), A pulsed electron injector using a metal photocathode irradiated by an excimer laser, Proceedings of Particle Accelerator Conference 1987 * Neutron beams may be created by energetic proton beams which impact on a target, e.g. of beryllium material. (see article Particle therapy) * Bursting a Petawatt Laser onto a titanium foil to produce a proton beam.Petawatt proton beams at Lawrence Livermore Manipulation =Acceleration= Charged beams may be further accelerated by use of high resonant, sometimes also superconducting, microwave cavities. These devices accelerate particles by interaction with an electromagnetic field. Since the wavelength of hollow macroscopic, conducting devices is in the radio frequency band, the design of such cavities and other RF devices is also a part of accelerator physics. More recently, plasma acceleration has emerged as a possibility to accelerate particles in a plasma medium, using the electromagnetic energy of pulsed high-power laser systems or the kinetic energy of other charged particles. This technique is under active development, but cannot provide reliable beams of sufficient quality at present. =Guidance= In all cases, the beam is steered with dipole magnets and focused with quadrupole magnets. With the end goal of reaching the desired position and beam spot size in the experiment. Applications =High-energy physics= High-energy particle beams are used for particle physics experiments in large facilities; the most common examples being the Large Hadron Collider and the Tevatron. =Synchrotron radiation= Electron beams are employed in synchrotron light sources to produce electromagnetic radiation with a continuous spectrum over a wide frequency band which is called synchrotron radiation. This radiation may be used at beamlines of the synchrotron storage ring for a variety of experiments. =Particle therapy= Energetic particle beams consisting of protons, neutrons, or positive ions (also called particle microbeams) may also be used for cancer treatment in particle therapy. =Astrophysics= Many phenomena in astrophysics are attributed to particle beams of various kinds. Perhaps of these the most iconic is the solar Type III radio burst, due to a mildly relativistic electron beam. =Military= Though particle beams are perhaps most famously employed as directed-energy weapon systems in science fiction, the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency started work on particle beam weapons in 1958. The general idea of such weaponry is to hit a target object with a stream of accelerated particles with high kinetic energy, which is then transferred to the molecules of the target. The power needed to project a high-powered beam of this kind surpasses the production capabilities of any standard battlefield powerplant, thus such weapons are not anticipated to be produced in the foreseeable future. =Mars colonization= Proton beams such as \\"laser-generated proton beams\\"Petawatt proton beams at Lawrence Livermore may be used as a way to generate hydrogen for the production of water on planets, such as Mars, where hydrogen is scarce and oxygen is relatively rich in the atmosphere in the form of CO2. In a Mars economy where the initial cost of water would be very high due to expense of transport from Earth to Mars, a machine that can generate hydrogen using nuclear alchemy, i.e., conversion of titanium into hydrogen ions using petawatt lasers, for example, is economical and may actually be cheaper and faster than transporting water from Earth to Mars if the technology is fully developed.Multi-planetary Society, Vol. 23, spring 2018 See also * Electron beam * Ion beam * Jet References Accelerator physics pt:Feixe (f√≠sica) ","title":"Particle beam"},{"id":"1359434","text":"There are many African reggae musicians with a wide fanbase both on the continent and abroad.

HHS funding includes the funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Technically the Dickey Amendment is a \\"rider\\" to other legislation, which amends the original legislation. The rider receives its name from the name of the Congressman that originally introduced the amendment, Representative Jay Dickey. The Dickey amendment language has been added to each of the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations acts for fiscal years 1997 through 2009. The original rider can be found in Section 128 of P.L. 104-99 . The wording of the rider is generally the same year after year. For fiscal year 2009, the wording in Division F, Section 509 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, (enacted March 11, 2009) prohibits HHS, including NIH, from using fiscal year 2009 appropriated funds as follows: :SEC. 509. (a) None of the funds made available in this Act may be used for-- ::(1) the creation of a human embryo or embryos for research purposes; or ::(2) research in which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed, discarded, or knowingly subjected to risk of injury or death greater than that allowed for research on fetuses in utero under 45 CFR 46.208(a)(2) and Section 498(b) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 289g(b)) (Title 42, Section 289g(b), United States Code). :(b) For purposes of this section, the term \\"human embryo or embryos\\" includes any organism, not protected as a human subject under 45 CFR 46 (the Human Subject Protection regulations) . . . that is derived by fertilization, parthenogenesis, cloning, or any other means from one or more human gametes (sperm or egg) or human diploid cells (cells that have two sets of chromosomes, such as somatic cells). In March 2009, President Obama issued an executive order which removed the restriction against federal funding of stem cell research. However, the Dickey‚ÄìWicker Amendment remains an obstacle for federally funded researchers seeking to create their own stem cell lines. In August 2010, as part of preliminary motions in Sherley vs Sebelius, Judge Royce C. Lamberth granted an injunction against federally funded embryonic stem cell (ESC) research on the grounds that the guidelines for ESC research \\"clearly violate\\" the Dickey‚ÄìWicker Amendment. In September 2010, he refused to lift the injunction pending the conclusion of the case and the issuance of his ruling and a likely appeal. In response, the Obama Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to lift the injunction via an order pending the appeal of Judge Lamberth's ruling, which it did on April 29, 2011. Judge Lamberth was thereby obliged to reverse his ruling, and grudgingly dismissed the case entirely on July 27, 2011. In the 2‚Äì1 opinion of April 29, 2011, the appeals panel said that the Dickey‚ÄìWicker Amendment was \\"ambiguous\\" and that the National Institutes of Health had \\"reasonably concluded\\" that although federal funds could not be used to directly destroy an embryo, the amendment does not prohibit funding a research project using embryonic stem cells. This is an important distinction under the law, because for federal funds to be used directly to support the destruction of embryos- as opposed to indirect use just in embryo stem cell research that avoids killing the embryo- is supposedly a violation of the Hyde Amendment, which has been ruled constitutional and which prohibits abortions using federal tax dollar funds (those questions will now have to be settled by the whole Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sitting en banc, or perhaps, ultimately, by the Supreme Court of the United States). History of US concerns about embryos Federal concern with human embryo research began over 25 years ago with the advent of assisted reproduction technologies, i.e. in vitro fertilization (IVF) or \\"test tube babies.\\" Although the first report of laboratory studies of human fertilization appeared in Science in 1944, (the work was conducted in Brookline, Massachusetts), clinical IVF was successful first in Great Britain in 1978 for couples with infertility. IVF became standard of care in the United States in the early 1980s. As with all forms of clinical treatment, the medical community looked to basic science research to improve the safety and efficacy of IVF for mothers and babies. In 1979, an Ethics Advisory Board for the National Institutes of Health issued guidelines for research on early human embryos, but no action was taken. The Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (see: Human subject research legislation in the United States) enacted in 1977 remained in place: 45CFR ¬ß 46.204(d), \\"No application or proposal involving human in vitro fertilization may be funded by the Department or any component thereof until the application or proposal has been reviewed by the Ethical Advisory Board and the Board has rendered advice as to its acceptability from an ethical standpoint.\\" Since there was no Ethics Advisory Board, federally funded research was not possible.

The River Dee runs mainly in North Wales before flowing through Chester, England, and then returning to Wales in a man- made channel constructed to gain land from the Dee Estuary. The Dee is the largest relatively clean river near to the North West conurbation and without water from the Dee much of Liverpool would be without water. However, the natural flow of the River Dee during most summers is insufficient to sustain any significant abstractions. To overcome this problem, a series of reservoirs have been constructed to store the excess water available in the winter time and release it back into the River Dee during the drier months. This is the principle of low-flow regulation. This was used by Thomas Telford at the beginning of the nineteenth century in order to guarantee a supply of water to the Ellesmere Canal. Telford constructed sluices at the outlet of Bala Lake to control the flow downstream so that there was always sufficient water to supply the canal where it started at Horseshoe Falls. The River Dee has also been used for direct drinking water supply with the Alwen Reservoir (), built in the 1920s to supply Birkenhead with water. In the industrial revolution many rivers in industrial areas became too polluted by effluents to be usable for water supply. The Dee however remained clean with relatively few polluting effluents in the Dee catchment upstream of Chester. Consequently, the City of Chester has been able to directly abstract Dee water since the first Chester Waterworks Company was formed in 1826.Dee Valley Water - Water resources Bala In the late 1950s the Bala Lake Scheme was promoted to increase the available water for abstraction in the River Dee. Telford's original sluices were by-passed and the natural lake outlet was lowered. New sluice gates were constructed downstream of the confluence with the Afon Tryweryn (), which is only a short distance from the lake exit. This provided 18 million cubic metres of stored water in Bala Lake that could be controlled and used on a seasonal basis for low-flow regulation. This enables continuous abstraction from the River Dee of 235,000 cubic metres per day by six statutory water undertakings and British Waterways Board. An additional benefit was a reduction in flooding events downstream of Bala as Bala Lake () was able to contain the worst of the winter flood peaks.Snowdonia National Park - Llyn Tegid Llyn Celyn As demand for water increased it was necessary to increase the storage on the River Dee and the next development was Llyn Celyn (), a new 81,000,000-cubic-metre capacity regulating reservoir within the Bala Lake catchment area. This was completed in 1967 by Liverpool Corporation, and designed to operate in conjunction with the Bala Lake Scheme. This enables additional Dee abstractions of 327,000 cubic metres litres per day together with additional flood control storage. In summer time the impact was to increase threefold the dry-weather flow for most of the length of the river. This development was hugely controversial at the time and remains politically fraught to this day since the construction of the reservoir involved flooding the Tryweryn Valley and the village of Capel Celyn and twelve farms. Local people saw this a destruction of part of the Welsh culture in order to supply England with water. This caused a great deal of controversy, resentment and protest. To try to offset some of the environmental concerns associated with the scheme, some of the stored water was specifically set aside to make special releases to help fisheries, to provide recreational opportunities (canoeing and white-water rafting on the Afon Tryweryn) and to disperse pollution events should they occur. A four megawatt hydro-electric station at the dam was also included in the scheme. Llyn Brenig Further statutory powers were gained in 1973 to construct another major regulating reservoir in the River Brenig valley - Llyn Brenig (). This reservoir was first filled in 1979 providing an additional of storage. This increased the potential for abstraction from the river in the lower reaches to nearly . By 2002 the authorised abstractions had been taken over by three statutory undertakings and British Waterways Board with a total licensed abstraction of . In addition a residual flow of at least 364,000 cubic metres per day is maintained over Chester Weir in all but the most testing of droughts, safeguarding the passage of migratory fish and limiting the ingress of saline water over Chester Weir during high tides. Operating rules The operating rules for the current system are agreed with all the participants and define the circumstances in which flow will be precisely managed. The key measuring location is at Manley Hall (), a gauging station near Chirk. This location was chosen as it was on a section of the river where flow could be readily measured and above the very flat stretch that meanders into Cheshire. The current rules state that when flow exceeds 10 m¬≥/s no intervention is required. In practice some adjustment of Bala sluices may take place to increase storage in Llyn Celyn and conversely some releases may be made from Llyn Celyn for recreational or power generation purposes. When the flow at Manley Hall decreases towards 10 m¬≥/s, additional flow is released from Llyn Tegid. If that is insufficient, flow from Llyn Celyn is used to maintain 10 m¬≥/s at Manley Hall. In extreme situations where the flow from Llyn Celyn is insufficient to maintain the flow, releases of water from Llyn Brenig are made. Circumstances can arise where even this is insufficient to maintain flows and in such cases drought provisions are agreed which progressively reduce the maintained flow at Manley Hall.Operation of the Scheme The overall effect of this regulation has a marked impact on the hydrograph of the River Dee . In dry years the hydrograph flat-lines at 10 m¬≥/s whilst dry weather continues such as in 1990 Manley Hall Time series data -1990 Quality management The River Dee regulation system also manages a water quality monitoring and alerting system that includes real-time quality monitoring for a wide range of chemical parameters supplemented by daily fixed site monitoring with analysis provided in near real-time by a dedicated laboratory service. The results of the analysis are made available to the four participating organisations on a routine daily basis. For each of the critical water quality parameters alert levels and action levels have been set based on past experience. If an alert level is exceeded an immediate alert (DEEPOL 1) is issued to all participants. As contamination levels increase or the contaminant plug nears an abstraction point the DEEPOL level rises to DEEPOL 2 and finally DEEPOL 3 at which time the affected abstractions are closed until the river quality returns to normal. This quality management system was developed following a severe Phenol pollution of the River Dee in the 1980s which resulted in contaminated water being supplied to large areas of Liverpool and the Wirral. Contamination of raw water is a more significant problem on the River Dee because the River Dee is normally of exceptionally good quality and as a result the abstractions have been constructed directly from the river rather than via bank-side storage reservoirs as is more common when taking water from Rivers of less reliable quality.

He was educated at the free grammar school of his native town, and in 1631 was nominated to the Lynn scholarship in Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1635 and MA in 1639. He was made rector of St Peter and St Paul's Church, Lavenham in Suffolk in 1644; and before he received that appointment he seems to have officiated, perhaps as curate, at Sudbury. At the Restoration he signed the declaration required by the Act of Uniformity 1662, and on this account he was the subject of a libellous attack, published in 1665, entitled Covenant-Renouncers Desperate Apostates. Christian in Complete Armour Gurnall is known by his Christian in Complete Armour, published in three volumes, dated 1655, 1658 and 1662. It consists of sermons or lectures delivered by the author in the course of his regular ministry, in a consecutive course on Ephesians 6: 10‚Äì20. It is described as a magazine whence the Christian is furnished with spiritual arms for the battle, helped on with his armour, and taught the use of his weapon; together with the happy issue of the whole war. It is thus considered a classic on spiritual warfare. The work is more practical than theological; and its style and its fervent religious tone continued to render it still popular with some readers. Richard Baxter and John Flavel both thought highly of the book. Toplady used to make copious extracts from it in his common-place book. John Newton, the converted slave trader, said that if he were confined to one book beside the Bible, he'd choose Christian Armour. Richard Cecil spent many of the last days of his life in reading it, and repeatedly expressed his admiration of it. Charles Haddon Spurgeon commented that Gurnall's work is \\"peerless and priceless; every line full of wisdom.

The places suggested by various authors are Seville, Vallejera, Cordovilla, or Astudillo, the last two in Palencia.-Seville, July 1361) was the mistress of King Peter of Castile.  Family  She was a Castilian noblewoman, daughter of Juan Garc√≠a de Padilla (died between 1348 and 1351) and his wife Mar√≠a Gonz√°lez de HenestrosaAlso spelled \\"Hinestrosa\\" or \\"Ynestrosa\\". (died after September 1356). Her maternal uncle was Juan Fern√°ndez de Henestrosa, the King's favorite between 1354 and 1359 after Juan Alfonso de Alburquerque fell out of favor, and the mediator in an apparent pardon for Fadrique Alfonso, King Peter's half-brother. She was also the sister of Diego Garc√≠a de Padilla, Grand Master of the Order of Calatrava. Mar√≠a‚Äôs family, members of the regional nobility, originally came from the area of Padilla de Abajo, near Castrojeriz in the province of Burgos. She is described in the chronicles of her time as very beautiful, intelligent, and small of body.‚Ä¶muy fermosa, e de buen entendimiento e peque√±a de cuerpo.  Relationship with King Peter of Castile  King Peter met Mar√≠a in the summer of 1352 during an expedition to Asturias to battle his rebellious half-brother Henry. It was probably her maternal uncle, Juan Fern√°ndez de Henestrosa, who introduced them, as mentioned in the chronicle of King Peter‚Äôs reign written by Pero L√≥pez de Ayala.En este tiempo, yendo el rey a Gij√≥n, tomo a do√±a Mar√≠a de Padilla que era una doncella muy fermosa e andaba en casa de do√±a Isabel de Meneses, muger de don Juan Alfonso de Alburquerque que la criaba, e tr√°xogela a Sant Fagund Juan Ferrandez de Henestrosa, su t√≠o, hermano de do√±a Mar√≠a Gonz√°lez, su madre. At that time, Mar√≠a was being raised at the house of Isabel de Meneses, wife of Juan Alfonso de Alburquerque, a powerful nobleman. They became lovers and their relationship lasted until her death despite the King‚Äôs other marriages and affairs. The Padillas were raised to various offices and dignities. Her uncle, Henestrosa, became Alcalde de los fidalgos.Storer, Edward. Peter the Cruel, John Lane, London In the summer of 1353, under coercion from family and the main court favorite, Juan Alfonso de Alburquerque, Peter wed Blanche of Bourbon, the first cousin of King John II of France. Peter abandoned Blanche within three days when he learned that she had an affair with his bastard brother Fadrique Alfonso en route to Spain, and that the dowry was not coming. Children Mar√≠a and Peter had three daughters: Beatrice (born 1354), Constance (1354-1394), and Isabella (1355-1392), and a son, Alfonso, crown-prince of Castile (1359 - October 19, 1362). Two of their daughters were married to sons of Edward III, King of England. Isabella married Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, while the elder, Constance, married John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, leading him to claim the crown of Castile on behalf of his wife.

Their use in psychiatric medicine is less evident. Death, deterioration and complications may be unavoidable in some patients due to underlying disease processes. However they may also be associated with errors or omissions in patient care. M&M; conferences involve the analysis of adverse outcomes in patient care, through peer review. The objectives of a well-run M&M; conference are to identify adverse outcomes associated with medical error, to modify behavior and judgment based on previous experiences, and to prevent repetition of errors leading to complications. Conferences are non-punitive and focus on the goal of improved patient care. The proceedings are generally kept confidential by law. M&M; conferences occur with regular frequency, often weekly, biweekly or monthly, and highlight recent cases and identify areas of improvement for clinicians involved in the case. They are particularly important for identifying systems issues (e.g., outdated policies, changes in patient identification procedures, arithmetic errors, etc.) which affect patient care. The results of a survey that endeavored to study the relevance and traits of morbidity and mortality conferences (M&MCs;) in the spring of 1998 indicate that 90% of U.S. internal medicine training programs hold M&MCs.; The majority of these conferences occur on a monthly basis, where an assigned leader reviews certain select cases that had unpredicted consequences or a suspected medical error. It was also reported that two-thirds of the hospitals use the M&MCs; as a means to fulfill their administrative requirements for quality assurance.

Web. 19 Feb. 2017.  History  Morbidity and Mortality conferences have long been part of the practice of medicine, having originated in the early 1900s with Ernest Codman at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He lost his staff privileges there after suggesting the evaluating of surgeon competence. Codman's ideas contributed to the standardization of hospital practices ‚Äî including a case report system that ascribed responsibility for adverse outcomes ‚Äî by the American College of Surgeons in 1916. As the medical profession evolved, physicians grew accustomed to discussing their errors at mortality conferences, where autopsy findings were presented, and in published case reports. By 1983, the ACGME began requiring that accredited residency programs conduct a weekly review of all complications and deaths.  Methods  A Mortality Review Task Force reviews and selects cases to be presented at each M&MC; conference. Cases selected include all deaths, significant patient injuries, and near-death situations. A core team of senior quality consultants prepares the selected cases for presentation, gathering and reviewing information that may have caused the case. Hospital physicians, residents, and staff are encouraged to attend the MM&I.; During the MM&I; meetings the leader reminds the participants of MM&I;'s confidentiality. Resident leaders present the cases and literature relating to the cases. Then the participants discuss and identify issues that may have led to the undesirable outcome. At the end of the conference, the leader reminds the participants of the MM&I;'s confidentiality once again and evaluates the conference. References External links *Carter, Laura Stephenson.

Early life Ryle was born in Onslow Square, South Kensington, London, on 25 May 1856, the second son of John Charles Ryle (1816‚Äì1900), the first Bishop of Liverpool, and his second wife, Jessie Elizabeth Walker. Herbert Ryle was three years old when his mother died, and in 1861 his father married Henrietta Clowes, who was a loving mother to her stepchildren. Ryle and his brothers and sisters were brought up in their father's country parishes in Suffolk, first at Helmingham and after 1861 at Stradbroke.M. H. FitzGerald, 'Ryle, Herbert Edward (1856‚Äì1925)', rev. Joanna Hawke, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 After attending school at Hill House, in Wadhurst, Sussex, Ryle went to Eton College in 1868. In 1875, he won the Newcastle scholarship, and in the same year he proceeded to King's College, Cambridge, as a classical scholar. A football accident in 1877 prevented him from further involvement in athletics and he took an Aegrotat degree in 1879. Between 1879 and 1881, however, he won every distinction open at Cambridge to students of theology, including a first class in the theological tripos. Career Ryle was elected a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, in April 1881, and began a career of twenty years as a teacher. He was ordained deacon in 1882 and priest in 1883. On 15 August 1883 he married Nea Hewish Adams. They had three sons, the eldest of whom died at birth. The youngest, aged only eight, died in 1897.M. H. Fitzgerald, A memoir of Herbert Edward Ryle (1928) From September 1886 to March 1888 Ryle was Principal of St David's College, Lampeter, from when until 1901 he taught at the University of Cambridge as Hulsean Professor of Divinity. During these years Ryle published a number of books connected with his academic interests, including The Early Narratives of Genesis (1892), The Canon of the Old Testament (1892), and Philo and Holy Scripture (1895). After his election as President of Queens' College, Cambridge in 1896 Ryle found little time for writing. He was, however, responsible for the edition of Genesis in the Cambridge Bible (1914), when he was Dean of Westminster. Ryle was appointed Honorary Chaplain to Queen Victoria in March 1896, and in December 1898 a Chaplain-in Ordinary to Her Majesty, from which post he resigned in early January 1901. In December 1900 Ryle was appointed Bishop of Exeter, being consecrated at Westminster Abbey in January 1901. In early October 1902 he was among the principal guests at the 75th anniversary of St. David's College in Lampeter, Wales, where he had been a Principal 15 years earlier. He became Bishop of Winchester in the spring of 1903. In 1909 he was chairman of the commission sent to Sweden by the Archbishop of Canterbury to investigate the possibility of closer relations between the English and Swedish churches. Dean of Westminster Vanity Fair in 1912 In December 1910 Ryle was appointed Dean of Westminster. He was installed in Westminster Abbey in April 1911, at a time when the building was being prepared for the coronation of King George V. He was created CVO in 1911. Under his guidance and with the help of his advisers, the dignity of the abbey services was notably increased, and his work was commemorated by the Dean Ryle Fund, a sum of ¬£170,000 raised for the maintenance of the abbey in response to an appeal issued by him in 1920. During World War I Ryle used to take the midday service of intercession personally, and he was responsible for the many special services held in wartime. The idea of a Tomb of The Unknown Warrior was first conceived in 1916 by David Railton, who, while serving as an army chaplain on the Western Front, had seen a grave marked by a rough cross, which bore the pencil-written legend 'An Unknown British Soldier'. He wrote to Ryle in 1920 proposing that an unidentified British soldier from the battlefields in France be buried with due ceremony in Westminster Abbey \\"amongst the kings\\" to represent the many hundreds of thousands of Empire dead. The idea was strongly supported by Ryle and the then Prime Minister David Lloyd George. There was initial opposition from King George V (who feared that such a ceremony would reopen the wounds of a recently concluded war) and others but a surge of emotional support from the great number of bereaved families ensured its adoption. The inscription on the tomb was composed by Ryle. UK Memorials Ryle withheld permission for the remains of Lord Byron to be interred in the abbey on the grounds that he considered Byron to be an inappropriate person for such an honour.Guardian ‚Äî Greeks honour fallen hero Byron with a day of his own Ryle was created KCVO in 1921. He was dean at the Wedding of Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Lady Elizabeth Bowes- Lyon. He had never been strong and had a history of heart trouble. In the autumn of 1924 his health broke down. After five months in a nursing home at Bournemouth he returned in May 1925 to the deanery, where he died on 20 August. He was buried on 25 August in Westminster Abbey in a spot close to the tomb of The Unknown Warrior. His wife survived him. Dean Ryle Street in Westminster is named after him.

Life He was the eldest son of John Ryle, private banker, of Park House, Macclesfield, M.P. for Macclesfield 1833‚Äì7, and Susanna, daughter of Charles Hurt of Wirksworth, Derbyshire. He was born at Macclesfield on 10 May 1816. He was educated at Eton and the University of Oxford, where his career was unusually distinguished. He was Fell exhibitioner at Christ Church, from which foundation he matriculated on 15 May 1834. He was Craven scholar in 1836, graduated B.A. in 1838, having been placed in the first-class in liter√¶ humaniores in the preceding year, and proceeded M.A. in 1871. He was created D.D. by diploma on 4 May 1880. Ryle left the university with the intention of standing for parliament on the first opportunity, but was unable to do so because of his father's bankruptcy. He took holy orders (1841‚Äì42) and became curate at Exbury, Hampshire. In 1843, he was preferred to the rectory of St Thomas, Winchester, which he exchanged in the following year for that of Helmingham, Suffolk. The latter living he retained until 1861, when he resigned it for the vicarage of Stradbroke in the same county. The restoration of Stradbroke church was due to his initiative. In 1869, he was made rural dean of Hoxne, and in 1872 honorary canon of Norwich. He was select preacher at Cambridge in 1873 and the following year, and at Oxford from 1874 to 1876, and in 1879 and the following year. In 1880, he was designated dean of Salisbury, and at once, 19 April, advanced to the newly created see of Liverpool, which he ably administered until his death at Lowestoft on 10 June 1900.

The third, on 24 October 1861, was to Henrietta, daughter of Lieutenant-colonel William Legh Clowes of Broughton Old Hall, Lancashire. He had a daughter by his first wife, and three sons by his second wife. His second son, Herbert Edward Ryle also a clergyman, became successively Bishop of Exeter, Bishop of Winchester and Dean of Westminster. Legacy Carlo Pellegrini, 1881. Ryle was a strong supporter of the evangelical school and a critic of Ritualism. He was a writer, pastor and an evangelical preacher. Among his longer works are Christian Leaders of the Eighteenth Century (1869), Expository Thoughts on the Gospels (7 vols, 1856‚Äì69), Principles for Churchmen (1884). Ryle was described as having a commanding presence and vigorous in advocating his principles albeit with a warm disposition. He was also credited with having success in evangelizing the blue collar community. He was a strong believer in the return of the Jews to their own land as being prophesied in the bible and thus was part of the movement that led to the Balfour Declaration.

Solar rotation varies with latitude. The Sun is not a solid body, but is composed of a gaseous plasma. Different latitudes rotate at different periods. The source of this differential rotation is an area of current research in solar astronomy. The rate of surface rotation is observed to be the fastest at the equator (latitude ) and to decrease as latitude increases. The solar rotation period is 24.47 days at the equator and almost 38 days at the poles. The average rotation is 28 days. Surface rotation as an equation The differential rotation rate is usually described by the equation: :\\\\omega=A+B\\\\,\\\\sin^2(\\\\varphi)+C\\\\,\\\\sin^4(\\\\varphi) where \\\\omega is the angular velocity in degrees per day, \\\\varphi is the solar latitude and A, B, and C are constants. The values of A, B, and C differ depending on the techniques used to make the measurement, as well as the time period studied. A current set of accepted average values is: :A= 14.713 ¬± 0.0491 ¬∞/d :B= -2.396 ¬± 0.188 ¬∞/d :C= -1.787 ¬± 0.253 ¬∞/d Sidereal rotation At the equator, the solar rotation period is 24.47 days. This is called the sidereal rotation period, and should not be confused with the synodic rotation period of 26.24 days, which is the time for a fixed feature on the Sun to rotate to the same apparent position as viewed from Earth. The synodic period is longer because the Sun must rotate for a sidereal period plus an extra amount due to the orbital motion of Earth around the Sun. Note that astrophysical literature does not typically use the equatorial rotation period, but instead often uses the definition of a Carrington rotation: a synodic rotation period of 27.2753 days or a sidereal period of 25.38 days. This chosen period roughly corresponds to the prograde rotation at a latitude of 26¬∞ north or south, which is consistent with the typical latitude of sunspots and corresponding periodic solar activity. When the Sun is viewed from the \\"north\\" (above Earth's north pole), solar rotation is counterclockwise (eastward). To a person standing on the North Pole, sunspots would appear to move from left to right across the Sun's face. =Bartels' Rotation Number= Bartels' Rotation Number is a serial count that numbers the apparent rotations of the Sun as viewed from Earth, and is used to track certain recurring or shifting patterns of solar activity. For this purpose, each rotation has a length of exactly 27 days, close to the synodic Carrington rotation rate. Julius Bartels arbitrarily assigned rotation one day one to 8 February 1832. The serial number serves as a kind of calendar to mark the recurrence periods of solar and geophysical parameters. =Carrington rotation= Five year video of Sun, one frame per Carrington period. The Carrington rotation is a system for comparing locations on the Sun over a period of time, allowing the following of sunspot groups or reappearance of eruptions at a later time. Because the Solar rotation is variable with latitude, depth and time, any such system is necessarily arbitrary and only makes comparison meaningful over moderate periods of time. Solar rotation is arbitrarily taken to be 27.2753 days for the purpose of Carrington rotations. Each rotation of the Sun under this scheme is given a unique number called the Carrington Rotation Number, starting from November 9, 1853. (The Bartels Rotation Number is a similar numbering scheme that uses a period of exactly 27 days and starts from February 8, 1832.) The heliographic longitude of a solar feature conventionally refers to its angular distance relative to the central meridian, i.e. that which the Sun-Earth line defines. The \\"Carrington longitude\\" of the same feature refers it to an arbitrary fixed reference point of an imagined rigid rotation, as defined originally by Carrington. Richard Christopher Carrington determined the solar rotation rate from low latitude sunspots in the 1850s and arrived at 25.38 days for the sidereal rotation period. Sidereal rotation is measured relative to the stars, but because the Earth is orbiting the Sun, we see this period as 27.2753 days. It is possible to construct a diagram with the longitude of sunspots horizontally and time vertically. The longitude is measured by the time of crossing the central meridian and based on the Carrington rotations. In each rotation, plotted under the preceding ones, most sunspots or other phenomena will reappear directly below the same phenomenon on the previous rotation. There may be slight drifts left or right over longer periods of time. The Bartels \\"musical diagram\\" or the Condegram spiral plot are other techniques for expressing the approximate 27-day periodicity of various phenomena originating at the solar surface. Using sunspots to measure rotation The rotation constants have been measured by measuring the motion of various features (\\"tracers\\") on the solar surface. The first and most widely used tracers are sunspots. Though sunspots had been observed since ancient times, it was only when the telescope came into use that they were observed to turn with the Sun, and thus the period of the solar rotation could be defined. The English scholar Thomas Harriot was probably the first to observe sunspots telescopically as evidenced by a drawing in his notebook dated December 8, 1610, and the first published observations (June 1611) entitled ‚ÄúDe Maculis in Sole Observatis, et Apparente earum cum Sole Conversione Narratio‚Äù (\\"Narration on Spots Observed on the Sun and their Apparent Rotation with the Sun\\") were by Johannes Fabricius who had been systematically observing the spots for a few months and had noted also their movement across the solar disc. This can be considered the first observational evidence of the solar rotation. Christoph Scheiner (‚ÄúRosa Ursine sive solis‚Äù, book 4, part 2, 1630) was the first to measure the equatorial rotation rate of the Sun and noticed that the rotation at higher latitudes is slower, so he can be considered the discoverer of solar differential rotation. Each measurement gives a slightly different answer, yielding the above standard deviations (shown as +/-). St. John (1918) was perhaps the first to summarise the published solar rotation rates, and concluded that the differences in series measured in different years can hardly be attributed to personal observation or to local disturbances on the Sun, and are probably due to time variations in the rate of rotation, and Hubrecht (1915) was the first one to find that the two solar hemispheres rotate differently. A study of magnetograph data showed a synodic period in agreement with other studies of 26.24 days at the equator and almost 38 days at the poles.5\\\\.

The transition between these regions is called the tachocline. Until the advent of helioseismology, the study of wave oscillations in the Sun, very little was known about the internal rotation of the Sun. The differential profile of the surface was thought to extend into the solar interior as rotating cylinders of constant angular momentum. Through helioseismology this is now known not to be the case and the rotation profile of the Sun has been found. On the surface, the Sun rotates slowly at the poles and quickly at the equator. This profile extends on roughly radial lines through the solar convection zone to the interior. At the tachocline the rotation abruptly changes to solid-body rotation in the solar radiation zone.

A flanged mandrel is a parallel bar of a specific diameter with an integral flange towards one end, and threaded at the opposite end. Work is gripped between the flange and a nut on the thread. A tapered mandrel (often called a plain mandrel) has a taper of approximately 0.005 inches per foot and is designed to hold work by being driven into an accurate hole on the work, gripping the work by friction. A threaded mandrel may have a male or female thread, and work which has an identical thread is screwed onto the mandrel. * On a lathe, mandrels are commonly mounted between centres and driven by a lathe dog (typically the flanged or tapered mandrels), but may also be gripped in a chuck (typically the threaded mandrels, where the outer face of work is to be machined. Threaded mandrels may also be mounted between centres. * In addition to lathes, arbors are used to hold buffing wheels, circular saws, and sanding discs. Typically, these mandrels consist of a cylinder that is threaded on one end. There are many different types of mandrels for specialized applications. Examples include live chuck mandrels, live bull ring mandrels, and dead bull ring mandrels. * a shaped bar of metal which is placed inside a workpiece to be formed, e.g. arbors used to bend the exhaust pipes for automobiles and in the production of molten glass, metal rings, threaded rods, and furniture legs.  Variants  An example of one type of mandrel is a shaped bar of metal inserted in, or next to, an item to be machined or bent in a certain pattern, e.g. in tube drawing. Exhaust pipes for automobiles are frequently bent using a mandrel during manufacture. The mandrel allows the exhaust pipes to be bent into smooth curves without undesirable creasing, kinking, or collapsing. Molten glass may be shaped in this way as well. Another example of this type of mandrel is found in jewelry manufacturing, where ring and bracelet mandrels are used to shape metal into a desired size and shape, using a tiny hammer to beat the metal against the mandrel. A type of mandrel is also used in making reeds for double reed instruments such as the bassoon or oboe. Another type of mandrel is the chuck that a lathe uses to hold pieces of wood, metal or plastic to be machined as they are turned. In this way, rods can be threaded, furniture legs are turned to have √¶sthetic patterns, and irregularly-shaped objects can be given a round shape. There are several types of mandrels used with lathes. Original expanding mandrels have a slightly tapered wedge that will expand to hold the item. The third type of mandrel discussed here is that which is used to hold circular saw blades, buffing wheels (used for polishing), and sanding discs onto drills, circular saws, and similar power tools. A mandrel of this type generally consists of a cylinder, threaded on one end, with a washer brazed onto the threaded end and an accompanying screw and second washer used to clamp the circular saw blade, sanding media, or other rotary tool onto the mandrel. While most mandrels are driven by direct connection to an electric motor or engine, other mandrels are driven by attachment to a bearing-supported, pulley-driven shaft.  Uses  Mandrels are also used in industrial composite fabrication such as in filament winding. During the manufacturing process, resin-impregnated filaments are wound around a mandrel to create a composite material structure or part. The structure is cured and the mandrel is removed. One problem with this type of process is that the mandrel can be very difficult to remove once the part has been cured. As a result, engineers have created a new type of mandrel that has the ability to change shape and be easily extracted. When heated above a certain temperature, the mandrel becomes elastic and can be manipulated into the desired shape and then cooled to become rigid again in the new shape. It can then be used in the filament winding process. Once the composite part is cured, the mandrel can be reheated until elastic and easily removed from the cured part. These types of mandrels can be used repeatedly. In the production of steel core used for flexible drives, the centre wire upon which the subsequent layers are wound is referred to as a Mandrel. This \\"centre wire\\" may itself be composed of either a single wire or layers, depending on the sizing of the finished product. A hole saw usually attaches to a mandrel, the latter being basically a drill bit with threads to secure the saw. History Mandrels are not recent inventions. Metal machining utilizing the spinning process has been recorded as far back as ancient Egyptian times. In metal spinning, a wood or metal spinning mandrel is used, the form of which corresponds with the internal contour of the part to be produced. This method securely clamps the raw material and allows for accurate machining into the desired final form. Since the material is clamped internally, there is no interference to the operator from the lathe/mandrel assembly during production. Also, the traversing mandrel was introduced around 1700, and instantiated the design of a lathe mandrel able to slide axially in its bearings under the control of the operator, so that components having short lengths of thread could be produced, such as screws. The traversing mandrel was primarily employed by clockmakers and ornamental turners during this era. Eventually the device was superseded by a mandrel-driven device called a leadscrew, which uses a train of gears that can be altered as required for the turning application.

When Raimund was bitten by a dog, which he falsely believed to be rabid, he shot himself on 29 August 1836 and died on 5 September 1836 in Pottenstein, aged 46. Raimund is buried in Gutenstein, which features a Raimund memorial. Raimund on an Austrian banknote, 1970 Raimund was a master of the Viennese Posse or farce; his rich humour is seen to best advantage in his realistic portraits of his fellow citizens. The Raimund Theater in Vienna is named after him.

Biography Groth was born in Heide, in Ditmarschen, the western part of the Duchy of Holstein. He was the oldest son of Hartwig Groth, a miller, and his wife Anna Christina. He spend an idyllic childhood in Heide which later inspired him to a lot of his poetic works. After visiting the local school, he visited the teacher seminar in Tondern from 1838 to 1841. Afterwards, Groth became a teacher at the girls school in his native village, devoting his spare time to the study of philosophy, mathematics, and the natural sciences. Furthermore, he valued his homeland's traditions so that he was involved in the revival of a couple of old traditions in Dithmarschen. Finding no joy in teaching, Groth had many differences with the school board as well as his pupils' parents. In 1847, he suffered a breakdown. Fellow teacher and friend Leonhard Selle invited Groth to spend time with him on the island of Fehmarn, in the Baltic Sea. He remained six years with Selle, and it was there that his famous Low German poetry compilation Quickborn was written. Becoming famous in all of Germany when the Quickborn was published in 1852, Groth moved to Kiel shortly after where he set to write more poems and first prose works in Low German. Since he was often of poor health, in 1855 he attempted to travel to Rome to recuperate, but he only came as far as Bonn. There, the University of Bonn awarded him with an honorary doctorate for his service to the German language. Back in Kiel after two years of travelling, he courted and married Doris Finke in 1859, the daughter of a wealthy wine merchant from Bremen. The couple had four sons. To provide for his family, Groth strove for a position as professor of literature at the University of Kiel where he was appointed professor in 1866, the same year, his oldest son died, and the family moved into a house of their own in the \\"Schwanenweg\\". Groth lived in this house until his death. Through many social gatherings and music evenings in their home that his wife organised, the Groth family established important social contacts, and became friends with many contemporary musicians, for example Clara Schumann and Johannes Brahms, a close friend of Groth. He became acquainted with many painters of his time as well which makes Klaus Groth the most painted poet in the 19th century. Several calamities in the following years hit Groth very hard. Doris Groth died in 1878 because of tuberculosis, and his youngest son died in 1889 from appendicitis. His eightieth birthday in 1899 gave cause for big festivities, especially in Kiel. The cities of Kiel and Heide respectively awarded him with the honorary citizenship. Only a few weeks after his birthday, Klaus Groth died on 1 June 1899. The big funeral service in Kiel was attended by many representatives of the government, politicians, contemporary poets, musicians, and artists. Works In his Low German lyric and epic poems, which reflect the influence of Johann Peter Hebel, Groth gives poetic expression to the country life of his northern home; and though his descriptions may not always reflect the peculiar characteristics of the peasantry of Holstein as faithfully as those of his rival Fritz Reuter - Groth strived to show the Low German language as well as the people who spoke it as something noble and worthy of high poetry -, Groth is a lyric poet of genuine inspiration.Inge Bichel, Ulf Bichel, Joachim Hartig, ed. (1994): Klaus Groth. Eine Bildbiographie, Heide 1994, His chief works are Quickborn, Volksleben - in plattdeutschen Gedichten Ditmarscher Mundart (1852; 25th ed. 1900; and in (standard) German translations, notably by MJ Berchem, Krefeld, 1896); and two volumes of stories, Vertelln (1835-1859, 3rd ed. 1881); also V√¶r de G√¶rn (1858) and Ut min Jungsparadies (1875). Groth's Gesammelte Werke appeared in 4 volumes (Kiel, 1893). His Lebenserinnerungen were edited by E. Wolff in 1891; see also K. Eggers, K. Groth und die plattdeutsche Dichtung (1885); and biographies by A. Bartels (1899) and H. Siercks (1899). Music Since Groth and his wife were well acquainted with many musicians of their time, a lot of his poems were set to music. All in all, there are 1149 known musical versions of his poems by 224 composers. Johannes Brahms set thirteen High German poems to music, among them the poem \\"Wie Melodien zieht es mir leise durch den Sinn\\" that became Brahms' No. 1 of his F√ºnf Lieder, Op. 105.* References = Citations = = Cited sources = * Bichel, Ingel, Bichel, Ulf, Hartig, Joachim, ed.

She served in the War of the Grand Alliance, and in her first year took part in the Battle of Barfleur and the action at La Hougue. Description Cornwall had a length at the gundeck of and at the keel. She had a beam of , and a depth of hold of . The ship's tonnage was 1,186 tons burthen. As built, the lower gundeck carried 24 broadside demi- cannon and a pair of chase culverins and the upper deck mounted 26 more culverins on the broadside and another pair as chase guns. On the quarterdeck were 16 six-pounder guns with 6 more on the forecastle. Above the quarterdeck, the poop deck carried 4 three-pounder guns. In 1703, Cornwalls armament was nominally revised to twenty-six 24-pounder guns on the lower gundeck and twenty-eight 12-pounder guns on the upper deck. The lighter guns were not changed, but it is uncertain if any changes were actually made to the ship's armament. The ship had a crew of 476‚Äì520 officers and ratings.Winfield, pp. 236‚Äì37. Construction and career Cornwall was the first ship in the Royal Navy to be named after the eponymous county.Colledge, p. 79. Part of the 1691 Naval Programme, the ship was ordered on 12 March 1691 and contracted out to John Winter in Southampton. She was launched at Southampton on 28 April 1692.

Remaining an 80-gun third rate, she was relaunched on 17 October 1726. After this, she served during peacetime in the Baltic and Mediterranean. She was not recommissioned until 1742, even though the War of the Austrian Succession had led to fighting between Great Britain and Spain in 1739. Cornwall initially served off Spain, but was later deployed to the West Indies where, in March 1748, she took part in the capture of Fort Saint Louis de Sud in the French colony of Haiti. In October 1749, Cornwall captured a 64-gun Spanish frigate during the defence of a convoy off Havana. She became a prison ship in 1755, ended her career in 1760 and was broken up in 1761.

Made in Panavision and Metrocolor and produced by Herb Jaffe and Phil Rawlins, the film was loosely based on the real-life Perdicaris incident of 1904. The film was produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and distributed in the U.S. by United Artists and internationally by Columbia Pictures. Plot During 1904, Morocco is the source of conflict among the powers of Germany, France, and the British Empire, each of which is trying to establish a sphere of influence in that country. Mulai Ahmed er Raisuli is the leader of a band of Berber insurrectionists opposed to the young Sultan Abdelaziz and his uncle, the Bashaw (Pasha) of Tangier, whom Raisuli considers corrupt and beholden to the Europeans. He kidnaps Eden Pedecaris and her children, William and Jennifer, in a raid on their home, during which Sir Joshua Smith, a British friend of Eden's, is killed. Raisuli then issues an outrageous ransom demand, deliberately attempting to provoke an international incident in order to embarrass the Sultan and start a civil war. In the United States, President Theodore Roosevelt is seeking re-election. He decides to use the kidnapping as both political propaganda (coining the phrase \\"Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead!\\") and as an effort to demonstrate America's military strength as a new great power, despite the protests of his cautious Secretary of State, John Hay. The American Consul to Tangier, Samuel Gummer√©, is unable to negotiate a peaceful return of the hostages. In response, Roosevelt sends the South Atlantic Squadron, under the command of Admiral French Ensor Chadwick, to Tangier, either to retrieve Pedecaris or to force the Sultan to accede to Raisuli's demands. Roosevelt finds himself gaining more and more respect for Raisuli, thinking him an honorable man who just happens to be his enemy. The Pedecarises are kept as hostages in the Rif, far from any potential rescuers. Though her children seem to admire Raisuli, Eden finds him \\"a brigand and a lout\\". The Pedecarises attempt an escape, helped by one of Raisuli's men, but they are betrayed and given to a gang of desert brigands. Luckily, Raisuli has tracked them and kills the kidnappers with a rifle and sword. He reveals that he does not have any intention of harming the Pedecarises and is merely bluffing. Eden and Raisuli come to develop a friendly relationship as Raisuli reveals his story, that he was once taken captive by his brother, the Bashaw, and kept in a dungeon for several years. Gummer√©, Chadwick, and his aide, Marine Captain Jerome, tire of the Sultan's perfidy and the meddling of the European powers. They decide to engage in \\"military intervention\\" to force a negotiation by seizing the actual seat of power, the Bashaw's palace in Tangier. Jerome's company of Marines, supported by a detachment of sailors, march through the streets of Tangier, much to the surprise of the European legations, whose forces are with the Sultan at distant Fez. They overwhelm the Bashaw's palace guard, taking the Bashaw hostage and forcing him to negotiate. Under coercion, the Bashaw finally agrees to accede to the Raisuli's demands. But during a hostage exchange, Raisuli is betrayed and captured by German and Moroccan troops under the command of von Roerkel, while Jerome and a small contingent of Marines are present to secure the Pedecarises. While Raisuli's friend, the Sherif of Wazan, organizes the Berber tribe for an attack on the Europeans and Moroccans, Eden attacks Jerome. She convinces him and his men to rescue Raisuli to uphold the word of President Roosevelt that he will be unharmed if the Pedecaris family are returned safely. A three-way battle results, in which the Berbers and Americans team up to defeat the Germans and their Moroccan allies, rescuing Raisuli in the process. In the United States, Roosevelt is cheered for this great victory, and the Pedecarises arrive safely back in Tangier. Roosevelt reads a letter he received from Raisuli, comparing the two men: \\"I (Raisuli), like the lion, must remain in my place, while you, like the wind, will never know yours\\".  Cast List  Inspiration Milius stated both in interviews and the DVD commentary that he was consciously echoing a number of classic adventure films and stories. He cites the famous British periodical Boy's Own, as well as the stories of Rudyard Kipling, as inspirations for the film. Milius' inspiration had come from reading an article by Barbara W. Tuchman about the Perdicaris incident in American Heritage magazine,\\"Perdicaris Alive or Raisuli Dead!\\", American Heritage August 1959; later republished in Tuchman's compilation book Practicing History: Selected Essays (1981), pp. 104-117 and he found the story fascinating; he decided to adapt it into a screenplay once he figured how to make the story more cinematic, by making Ion Perdicaris a woman, Eden Pedecaris. Milius also researched Rosita Forbes's 1924 biography of Raisuli, The Sultan of the Mountains; much of the film's dialogue is appropriated almost word-for-word from Forbes's book. Walter Harris's 1921 book Morocco That Was inspired the depiction of Sultan Abdelaziz's court.cf. Harris, pp. 81-83 Milius took similar care in researching the scenes with Theodore Roosevelt. Milius says he originally wanted Mrs. Pedecaris to be 55 or 60 and played by Katharine Hepburn with the children being her grandchildren, and the Berber would be a similar age. \\"Her husband has died years ago, she's a stern, rich old woman, and she has a last romantic fling with this stern, rich old Berber, the Sultan of the mountains, who can't really do all the things he used to do but pulls it together one more time to save her from the Blue People. A very heroic character. And of course the children would look at such a character as being even greater than Sean Connery ‚Äì this old man would be the greatest old thing they'd ever seen, and they'd have great admiration for their grandmother for standing up to him, the way old people can snipe at each other and love each other because they have the common bond of age. That was the purest form the movie ever had. Roosevelt was a very young, visceral presence, a vibrant man who represented a new world, who understood Raisuli's world very well but was forced to change it\\". Milius had to make the leading characters younger to get the film financed. \\"No one wanted to make a movie about Arabs and Teddy Roosevelt. So we had to make concessions: a more romantic male, a beautiful woman, much more box office that way. You make these concessions as you go along and perhaps, at a certain point in your career, you don't have to make them, and you make Barry Lyndon. Maybe it's better that you make concessions\\". Milius said the film was a \\"boy's adventure movie ... seen through children's eyes ... I'm sick of seeing children used as a point of view when they're sitting there blanching with terror\\". 1930s adventure films like Gunga Din and The Four Feathers provided inspiration for the film's style and storytelling technique. The use of children as protagonists is also inspired by the book and the film A High Wind in Jamaica, while the relationship between Raisuli and Eden is based on the 1921 film The Sheik. Raisuli's rescue of the Pedecarises on the beach is similar to another mounted sword-fighting scene in Akira Kurosawa's 1958 film The Hidden Fortress, and the scene of Jennifer Pedecaris being cornered by Aldo Sambrell's character and kidnapped is a reference to the 1956 film The Searchers. Most noticeably, the film inherits a cavalier attitude towards imperialism, foreign policy, and military intervention, attitudes which were relatively unpopular in 1975 America at the end of the Vietnam War. Milius' apparent endorsement of imperialism was not attacked by critics, perhaps due to the film's subtle satiric manner and for the accurate recreation of the era in which its story is set. \\"I think people should take home more understanding ‚Äì or rather awareness ‚Äì of what I think is the American character\\", said Milius. \\"It's very well put in the grizzly bear. I don't think Americans are necessarily civilised or too calm and rational about their approach to life. I rather like that. I really like grizzly bears too. I like grizzly bears a lot more than most people ... You can take the [film's] politics to be anyway you want, for or against the United States\\". Milius also had inspiration from more recent films while making the film. He based the film's cinematography, use of desert landscapes, and filming of battle scenes on David Lean's 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia, also using many of the same sets, including the \\"Aqaba\\" set which had been constructed for Lean's film, here serving as the setting for the final, three-way battle between the Berbers, the Europeans and their Moroccan allies, and the Americans. The Bashaw's palace was the Palace of the Americas in Seville, having appeared in both Lawrence of Arabia and Anthony Mann's 1961 film El Cid. Another major influence is the 1969 film The Wild Bunch, which inspired the final confrontation between the American and German troops and the earlier scene where the Sultan test-fires his Maxim gun. Production The film was a co production between MGM, then under the control of Daniel Melnick, and Columbia Pictures, then run by Peter Guber. It was produced by Herb Jaffe making his first film as an independent after five years as head of production at United Artists. Milius originally wanted Omar Sharif to play Raisuli and Faye Dunaway to play Eden Perdicaris, but Sharif refused the part and Dunaway became ill due to exhaustion, having to be replaced at short notice by Bergen. Anthony Quinn was also considered for Raisuli. Milius said he wrote the part of Eden with Julie Christie in mind, although she may not have actually been approached for the role. Milius wanted Orson Welles to play newspaper magnate \\"Charles Foster Kane\\" (the name of his character in Citizen Kane) in the film, but the studio would not let him as they were worried about being sued by RKO. Instead, he used the character of William Randolph Hearst.Segaloff, Nat, \\"John Milius: The Good Fights\\", Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s, Ed. Patrick McGilligan, University of California 2006 p. 291-292 Filming was done in Spain, with the towns of Seville, Almer√≠a, and Madrid all doubling for Tangier and Fez, and the \\"Washington\\" scenes being filmed in and around Madrid. For the deserts of Morocco, Milius used many locations in the Almer√≠a region, some of which had been previously used in historical epics such as Lawrence of Arabia and El Cid, as well as several Spaghetti Westerns; Milius claims to have discovered the beach where Raisuli rescues the Perdicaris family after their escape. The scene at Yellowstone National Park (where Roosevelt gives his famous grizzly bear speech) was filmed in the Meseta Central, north of Madrid. These latter two locations would each re-appear in Milius' 1982 film Conan the Barbarian. The Marines and sailors used in the Tangier attack scene were Spanish special forces troops, along with a handful of U. S. Marine Corps advisers, who marched with precision through the streets of Seville and Almer√≠a en route to the Bashaw's palace. According to Milius (on the DVD commentary), the U. S. Marine Corps actually shows this scene to its advanced infantry classes for midshipmen at the U. S. Naval Academy. According to Milius, virtually all of the film's stunts were performed by Terry Leonard. Leonard was the stunt coordinator and did some of the stunts and also has a minor part as Roosevelt's boxing opponent early in the film. Milius claims that only four American stunt men were used in the entire final battle scene; the number of Spanish stunt men was close to twenty throughout the filming. He and Leonard have defended the film against criticism for alleged \\"animal cruelty\\", claiming that not a single horse was seriously hurt during filming. While filming this scene, Antoine Saint-John revealed himself to be terrified of horses, and would often hide somewhere on the set when his sword fight with Sean Connery was to be filmed. Several of the crew are cast, most notably the cinematographer, Billy Williams (perhaps best known for Ken Russell's 1969 film Women in Love), plays the gun-shooting, white-suited Englishman Sir Joshua Smith in the opening scenes of the attack at the Pedecaris villa. The special effects supervisor Alex Weldon appears as Roosevelt's Secretary of War, Elihu Root, and Milius himself cameos as the one-armed German officer who gives the Sultan his Maxim gun to test-fire (\\"Herr Sultan is displeased?\\"). Milius later said he did not particularly enjoy working with Candice Bergen or Sean Connery, particularly Connery because he was so \\"sour and dour\\". He greatly admired Connery's performance, whereas he felt Bergen's acting range was extremely limited, and she was only concerned with looking good. Reception The Wind and the Lion debuted in New York during May 1975 and Britain in October. The film was also a financial success, though Steven Spielberg's hit film Jaws distracted attention away from it. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 63% based on reviews from 16 critics. On Metacritic the film has a score of 69% based on reviews from 9 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Variety called it \\"Generally literate and very commercial period action drama, well written and better directed by John Milius.\\" Shortly after its release, the film was screened for U. S. President Gerald Ford and his staff, who reportedly loved it. =Awards and honors= The film was nominated for two Academy Awards; Jerry Goldsmith for Best Original Score and Harry W. Tetrick, Aaron Rochin, William McCaughey, Roy Charman for Best Sound. Additionally, the Writers Guild of America nominated Milius' screenplay. Novel A novel based on Milus's film was published by Award Books in January 1975. Based on the screenplay, the story is slightly different from the finished film, with several additional scenes (notably, Eden Perdicaris taking a bath at Raisuli's palace and Gummer√© watching the Atlantic Squadron arrive in Tangier) included, and the story's chronology slightly different. The first printing included a chapter about production events and brief biographies of the cast and crew. Music The score to The Wind and the Lion was composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith. True to the style of such Golden Age scores as Maurice Jarre's Lawrence of Arabia, Goldsmith used a diverse ensemble that relied heavily upon a large percussion section and a variety of Moroccan instrumentation.The Wind and the Lion soundtrack review at Filmtracks.com The music went on to earn Goldsmith an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score, though he lost to fellow composer John Williams for Jaws. It is often regarded as one of the best scores of his career and was one of the American Film Institute's 250 nominees for the top 25 American film scores.AFI's 100 Years Of Film Scores at AFI.com Home media In Region 1, Warner Home Video released the film on DVD on January 6, 2004, featuring a brief production featurette, the theatrical trailer, and a commentary by Milius.

He flew aboard the Spirit of St. Louis with Charles Lindbergh in two test flights. He died in an attempt to cross the Atlantic Ocean with Frances Wilson Grayson aboard The Dawn. Birth and early career Brice was born in Sioux City, Iowa on March 30, 1889. His brother was Charles Frances Goldsborough. In 1910, he was serving in the United States Navy and living in Washington, D.C., and he was working as an electrician. He moved to Long Island and later to Manhattan. After serving two four-year terms in the Navy, he and Morris Titterington, the inventor of the ground induction compass, formed the Pioneer Instrument Company in 1919. In 1923, they moved the company to 754 Lexington Ave. in Brooklyn, after buying Brandis & Sons Company. Charles H. Colvin joined the company and was elected president, with both Brice and Morris as vice presidents. 1926 Ford Reliability NationalTour Walter Beech (1891-1950) and Brice Herbert Goldsborough won the 1926 Ford Reliability National Air Tour aboard their Travel Air B6 airplane.

Lindbergh's record breaking flight was on May 20‚Äì21, 1927. The crash On December 23, 1927 Frances Wilson Grayson with Brice H. Goldsborough as her navigator left from Curtis Field in New York for Harbour Grace, Newfoundland. Her plan was to leave from Newfoundland on a record setting transatlantic flight to London on Christmas day. Her plane, The Dawn was to be flown by Oskar Omdal, a lieutenant in the Norwegian Navy. Grayson may have planned to fly the plane in shifts with him. Goldsborough would have been the navigator and Frank Koehler was to be the radio operator. Her plane never reached Newfoundland and sank in the water. There were several accounts of receiving radio messages from the plane when it was in distress. The bodies and the airplane were never recovered. Family Brice's son was Frank Goldsborough (1910-1930), who was a record-setting aviator who also died in a crash. Commemoration In 1928, the Ontario Surveyor General named a number of lakes in the northwest of the province to honour aviators who had perished during 1927, mainly in attempting oceanic flights. p 14.

The family Azotobacteraceae was recently reclassified into this family. History Pseudomonad literally means false unit, being derived from the Greek pseudo (œàŒµœÖŒ¥Œø ‚Äì false) and monas (ŒºŒøŒΩŒøœÇ ‚Äì a single unit). The term \\"monad\\" was used in the early history of microbiology to denote single-celled organisms. Because of their widespread occurrence in nature, the pseudomonads were observed early in the history of microbiology. The generic name Pseudomonas created for these organisms was defined in rather vague terms in 1894 as a genus of Gram-negative, rod-shaped, and polar- flagellated bacteria. Soon afterwards, a large number of species was assigned to the genus. Pseudomonads were isolated from many natural niches. New methodology and the inclusion of approaches based on the studies of conservative macromolecules have reclassified many species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is increasingly recognized as an emerging opportunistic pathogen of clinical relevance. Studies also suggest the emergence of antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa. In 2000, the complete genome of a Pseudomonas species was sequenced; more recently, the genomes of other species have been sequenced, including P. aeruginosa PAO1 (2000), P. putida KT2440 (2002), P. fluorescens Pf-5 (2005), P. fluorescens PfO-1, and P. entomophila L48. Several pathovars of Pseudomonas syringae have been sequenced, including pathovar tomato DC3000 (2003), pathovar syringae B728a (2005), and pathovar phaseolica 1448A (2005).

Early life Fritz Reuter was born at Stavenhagen in the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, a small country town where his father was mayor and sheriff (Stadtrichter) and, in addition to his official duties, carried on the work of a farmer. He was educated at home by private tutors and subsequently at Gymnasien in Mecklenburg-Strelitz and in Parchim. Early career and imprisonment In 1831, Reuter began to attend lectures on jurisprudence at the University of Rostock, and in the following year went to the University of Jena. Here he was a member of the political students' club Burschenschaft ‚ÄúGermania,‚Äù and in 1833 was arrested in Berlin by the Prussian government and interned at Fort Silberberg in Silesia. Although the only charge which could be proved against him was that he had been seen wearing the club's colours, he was condemned to death for high treason. This sentence was commuted by King Frederick William III of Prussia to imprisonment for thirty years in a Prussian fortress. In 1838, through the personal intervention of the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg, he was delivered over to the authorities of his native state, and he spent the next two years in the fortress of D√∂mitz, but was set free in 1840, when an amnesty was proclaimed after the accession of Frederick William IV to the Prussian throne. Although Reuter was now thirty years of age, he went to Heidelberg to resume his legal studies, but was forced by his father to give them up when it was found that he paid little attention to his studies. After returning to Mecklenburg, he spent some time with his uncle, a minister at Jabel, and then began working on an estate, in 1842, as Strom (trainee). Finding out, upon his father's death in 1845, that he had been disinherited, he realized that acquiring an estate of his own was out of the question, and he began to write, first in High German, later, with more success, in Low German. In 1850 he settled as a private tutor in the little town of Treptow an der Tollense in Pomerania (today Altentreptow, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern), and was now able to marry Luise Kuntze, the daughter of a Mecklenburg pastor. Early works For a bibliography of Reuter's works see :de:Fritz Reuter#Werke. The Fritz-Reuter-Literaturmuseum in Stavenhagen. Reuter's first publication was a collection of miscellaneous poems, written in Low German, entitled L√§uschen un Riemels (‚Äúanecdotes and rhymes,‚Äù 1853; a second collection followed in 1858). The book, which was received with encouraging favour, was followed by Polterabendgedichte (1855), and De Reis' nach Belligen (1855), the latter a humorous epic poem describing the adventures of some Mecklenburg peasants who resolve to go to Belgium (which they never reach) to learn the secrets of modern farming. In 1856 Reuter left Treptow and established himself at Neubrandenburg, resolving to devote his whole time to literary work. His next book (published in 1858) was Kein H√ºsung, a verse epic in which he presents with great force and vividness some of the least attractive aspects of village life in Mecklenburg. This was followed, in 1860, by Hanne N√ºte un de l√ºtte Pudel, the last of the works written by Reuter in verse. In 1861 Reuter's popularity was largely increased by Schurr-Murr, a collection of tales, some of which are in standard German, but this work is of slight importance in comparison with the series of stories, entitled Olle Kamellen (\\"old stories of bygone days\\"). The first volume, published in 1860, contained Woans ick tau 'ne Fru kam and Ut de Franzosentid. Ut mine Festungstid (1861) formed the second volume; Ut mine Stromtid (1864) the third, fourth and fifth volumes; and D√∂rchl√§uchting (1866) the sixth volume ‚Äì all written in the Plattdeutsch dialect of the author's home. Woans ick tau 'ne Fru kamm is a bright little tale, in which Reuter tells, in a half serious half bantering tone, how he wooed the lady who became his wife. In Ut de Franzosentid the scene is laid in and near Stavenhagen in the year 1813, and the characters of the story are associated with the great events of the Napoleonic wars which then stirred the heart of Germany to its depths. Ut mine Festungstid, a narrative of Reuter's hardships during the term of his imprisonment, is no less vigorous either in conception or in style. Both novels have been translated into English by Carl F. Bayerschmidt, Ut mine Festungstid as Seven Years of My Life in 1975, and Ut de Franzosentid as When the French Were Here in 1984. Later works For a bibliography of Reuter's works see :de:Fritz Reuter#Werke. Fritz Reuter's gravesite in Eisenach. The novel From My Farming Days Ut mine Stromtid (3 volumes) is by far the greatest of Reuter's writings. The men and women he describes are the men and women he knew in the villages and farmhouses of Mecklenburg, and the circumstances in which he places them are the circumstances by which they were surrounded in actual life. Ut mine Stromtid also presents some local aspects of the revolutionary movement of 1848. M. W. MacDowell translated this book from German into English as From My Farming Days in 1878. A better translation is that by Katharine Tyler, which predated MacDowell's. It appeared in 1871 in Littell's Living Age and in 1872 in book form, titled Seed-Time and Harvest. In 1863 Reuter transferred his residence from Neubrandenburg to Eisenach, after having received an honorary doctorate from Rostock University, and here he died on 12 July 1874. Reuter's stories are lacking in plot, but are marked by clever episodes, skillful character drawing and a humor, which, despite the difficulty of his medium, was universally appreciated in Germany. His S√§mtliche Werke (collected works), in 13 volumes, were first published in 1863-1868. To these were added in 1875 two volumes of Nachgelassene Schriften, with a biography by Adolf von Wilbrandt, and in 1878 two supplementary volumes to the works appeared. A popular edition in 7 vols was published in 1877-1878 (last edition, 1902); there are also editions by Karl Friedrich M√ºller (18 vols, 1905), and Wilhelm Seelmann (7 vols, 1905-1906). Interest in Reuter was revived in the period after World War II, in part through the efforts of Friedrich Griese. Among the institutions concerning themselves with the works of Reuter are the Fritz Reuter Gesellschaft e.V. in Neubrandenburg, the Fritz- Reuter-Literaturmuseum in Stavenhagen, the Reuter-Wagner-Museum in Eisenach, and the Fritz Reuter Literary Archive (Fritz Reuter Literaturarchiv) Hans- Joachim Griephan in Berlin. The latter archive keeps an index of the letters from and to Fritz Reuter.

It is notable in that only a single displacement, , was produced in this series. All were belt-driven OHC non- interference engines (except the VVT-i version in the Lexus IS200 which is an interference engine), with multivalve DOHC (except the 1G-EU SOHC 12 valve engine) and even variable valve timing added later. The 1G-GEU was Toyota's first four-valve twincam engine. A prototype version of the 1G-GEU called the LASREŒ±-X, featuring twin-turbos, variable valve timing and intake as well as variable displacement, was fitted to the Toyota FX-1 show car at the 1983 Tokyo Motor Show. It showcased a number of technologies which were later to become commonplace.All About the Toyota Twin Cam, p. 18 These engines were used as a lower-displacement alternative to the more upmarket M family and JZ family straight-sixes. For ten months (in 1967-1968), Toyota also offered Hino's GR100 engine as the \\"Toyota G\\" in the shortlived Briska light truck. G (Hino GR100) After Toyota's takeover of Hino Motors in 1967, the Briska one-tonne truck was sold with Toyota badging for ten months. The engine code was changed from Hino's \\"GR100\\" to \\"G\\" for these cars. The engine is a 1251 cc watercooled OHV inline-four with distant Renault origins and was originally developed by Hino for their Contessa passenger car. Bore and stroke are , maximum power at 5500 rpm. Hino's earlier models had a variety of power outputs ranging from 52 to 65 PS. Apart from its name, this engine is unrelated to the later series of Toyota G engines. 1G Since just one displacement was offered, all G-family engines are marked 1G and share the same \\"square\\" bore and stroke. Applications: * Toyota Soarer * Toyota Celica Supra * Toyota Crown * Toyota Cressida/Mark II/Cresta/Chaser * Toyota Altezza * Lexus IS200 =1G-E= The export-spec two-valve 1G-E had no emissions controls and were used in commercial vehicles and for a few export markets, mostly southeast Asia. Typical specifications: * at 5000 rpm, torque at 4000 rpm (Mark II, 1986, Indonesia) * at 5200 rpm, JDM Crown GS130/131/136V/130G =1G-EU= The Japan-spec 1G-EU was produced from 1979 through 1988. This and the 1G-E are the only two-valve SOHC members of the family. Output was at 5400 rpm and at 4400 rpm. =1G-FE= 1G-FE The DOHC 1G-FE uses a narrow valve angle and other fuel economy optimizations. It was introduced in 1988, it features a cast iron block with aluminum cylinder head. Output was at 5,600 rpm and at 4,400 rpm. In 1998 VVT-i was added, which bumped output to at 6,200 rpm and at 4,400 rpm for the Altezza/IS 200. With the end of the first generation Lexus IS this engine ceased production in 2005. Applications: * Toyota Altezza/Lexus IS 200 * Toyota Crown * Toyota Chaser * Toyota Mark II *Toyota Mark II Blit * Toyota Cresta =1G-GEU= The 24-valve DOHC 1G-GEU was intended for high performance and featured a pent-roof combustion chamber.All About the Toyota Twin Cam, p. 21 Introduced in August 1982 and produced through 1986, mostly for the Japanese market, output was at 6,200 rpm and at 5,600 rpm. This was Toyota's first multi-valve twincam engine to make it to the market, and won the \\"JSME Medal for New Technology\\" (Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers) in 1982. To minimize the downsides of a multi-valve setup, the 1G-GEU was also equipped with T-VIS (Toyota Variable Induction System), increasing low to mid-engine speed torque. Like all following twin cam Toyotas, it used a timing belt rather than chain, for less noise and lower maintenance requirements. In August 1983, the fuel injection system was changed to EFI-D, which measures the pressure in the intake manifold to determine the proper air-fuel mixture.All About the Toyota Twin Cam, p. 20 Applications: * Aug 1981-1985 Celica XX GA61 * Aug 1982-? Toyota Chaser/Mark II/Cresta * Aug 1983-? Toyota Crown * Feb 1983-? Toyota Soarer =1G-GE= The 1G-GE replaced the 1G-GEU in 1988. It was detuned from down to and served the same cars as 1G-GEU did. It was produced for the Supra GA70 until 1993. =1G-GTE= Toyota 1G-GTE The 24-valve DOHC 1G-GTE added two CT-12 turbochargers to the versatile motor. There were 3 generations of this engine both air-to-air and air-to-water intercoolers were used, pushing output from at 6200 rpm and at 3800 rpm using the air-to-air over the air-to-water. This was the most powerful engine of the whole G family. In May 1991 it was replaced with >280 hp 1JZ-GTE on most Toyota cars. Applications: * 1986-1992 Supra MK3 (chassis code GA70, JDM only) * 1986-1992 Mark II/Chaser/Cresta (chassis code GX71/GX81) * 1986-1991 Soarer (chassis code GZ20) = 1G-GP/GPE= The 1G-GP and 1G-GPE was an LPG version of the 1G-GE engine.

Output is at 6000 rpm and at 3600 rpm. Like the turbo, it was a 24-valve DOHC engine but featured a distributorless ignition system (DIS). The 1G-GZE was mated only with automatic gearboxes. In August 1991 it was replaced with the 1JZ-GE on the Mark II/Chaser/Cresta, while serving on the Crown until 1992.

She served in the English Channel until the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763. After service as a guard ship at Plymouth, she was sent to North America to serve in the American Revolutionary War. She arrived in New York on 30 July 1779 and just ten days later was in a confrontation with the French Navy. Later that year she was deployed to the West Indies where she was badly damaged in action off Grenada and again off Martinique in 1780.

He was also an intelligence officer, theologian and writer. Early life and education Anderson was born in Mountjoy Square, Dublin, Ireland. His father, Matthew Anderson, was Crown Solicitor, a distinguished elder in the Presbyterian Church of Ireland, and of Ulster Scots descent. Matthew married Mary, daughter of Samuel Lee of Derry. Robert described himself as \\"an anglicised Irishman of Scottish extraction\\".Anderson, R., Redemption Truths, Introduction by Wiersbe, W., Kregel 1980, ISB0-8254-2131-4, page vi His elder brother Sir Samuel Lee Anderson was a successful barrister who invariably acted for the Crown, and like his brother also acted as an intelligence officer. Their sister Annie married Sir Walter Boyd, 1st Baronet, a dominant figure among the Irish judiciary in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and a staunch upholder of British rule in Ireland. Annie played a key role in her brother's religious development. On leaving school, Anderson began a business apprenticeship in a large brewery, but after eighteen months he decided not to go into business and left. After studying in Boulogne-sur-Mer and Paris, he entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1862, and in 1863 was called to the Irish Bar. He received a Bachelor of Laws degree from Trinity College in 1875. Legal and secret service career Anderson began to practice as a barrister. However, in 1865, his father showed him papers relating to the trials of Fenians and he too became involved in the operations against them, becoming the foremost expert on the Fenians and operations against them. In 1868, he was called to London, following the murder of a policeman in Manchester during a Fenian jailbreak in September 1867 (see Manchester Martyrs) and the bombing of Clerkenwell Gaol in another rescue attempt three months later (see Clerkenwell Outrage). In April 1868, he was attached to the Home Office as adviser on political crime. However, although Anderson remained in this post, Fenianism became more or less dormant, and to justify his salary he was appointed secretary to several government inquiries. In 1877, he was appointed secretary to the new Prison Commission. In the early 1880s, however, the Fenians began operations again and in 1883, they commenced a bombing campaign in England. Anderson was not particularly effective in combating them, and in May 1884 he was forced to resign his Home Office post, to be replaced by Edward Jenkinson. In 1886, he was also removed from the Prison Commission. Police career In 1887, Jenkinson resigned, and Anderson was once again the only man available with experience in anti-Fenian activities. He was asked to assist James Monro, Assistant Commissioner (Crime) at Scotland Yard, in operations related to political crime. In 1888, Monro was promoted to Commissioner, and Anderson replaced him as Assistant Commissioner, the post he was to hold for the rest of his career. The Criminal Investigation Department was then just starting the investigation into the Jack the Ripper murders, which he thought were grossly over-sensationalized. Almost immediately after being promoted, Anderson went on an extended holiday in France, leaving others in charge. He was called back after a month because of increased bad publicity over the Ripper murders. Anderson retired in 1901, and was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the King's Birthday Honours List in November 1901, having been appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1896. Religion Anderson was brought up in a devout Christian home, but in his late teens he had doubts about his faith. His sister Annie, later Lady Boyd, was influenced by the Irish Evangelical Revival of 1859‚Äì1860 and persuaded him to attend one of the services held in Dublin by the Reverend Joseph Denham Smith, but he was not particularly impressed. The following Sunday evening, however, he attended a service in his own church and heard the Reverend John Hall (afterwards of New York), who \\"boldly proclaimed forgiveness of sins, and eternal life as God's gift in grace, unreserved and unconditional, to be received by us as we sat in the pews. His sermon thrilled me,\\" Anderson wrote later when describing the event, \\"and yet I deemed his doctrine to be unscriptural. So I waylaid him as he left the vestry, and on our homeward walk I tackled him about his heresies‚Ä¶ At last he let go my arm, and, facing me as we stood upon the pavement, he repeated with great solemnity his gospel message and appeal. 'I tell you,' he said, 'as a minister of Christ, and in His name, that there is life for you here and now if you will accept Him. Will you accept Christ, or will you reject Him?' After a pause ‚Äì how prolonged I know not ‚Äì I exclaimed, 'In God's name I will accept Christ.' Not another word passed between us; but after another pause he wrung my hand and left me. And I turned homewards with the peace of God filling my heart.\\"Anderson, R., Redemption Truths, Introduction by Wiersbe, W., Kregel 1980, ISB0-8254-2131-4, pages vi‚Äìvii He was especially close to some of the greatest biblical teachers of his day, including James Martin Gray, Cyrus Scofield, A. C. Dixon, Horatius Bonar and E. W. Bullinger. He also preached with John Nelson Darby in the West of Ireland. Anderson was a member of the Plymouth Brethren, first with Darby then with the Open Brethren party, before returning to his Presbyterian roots. He wrote numerous theological works: C. H. Spurgeon commented that Anderson's book Human Destiny was \\"the most valuable contribution on the subject\\" that he had seen.Anderson, R., Redemption Truths, Introduction by Wiersbe, W., Kregel 1980, ISB0-8254-2131-4, page viii Personal life and death In 1873, he married Lady Agnes Alexandrina Moore, sister of Ponsonby Moore, 9th Earl of Drogheda. They had five children. Anderson died from the Spanish flu in 1918, aged 77.Times (London) - 18 November 1918 - DEATH OF SIR ROBERT ANDERSON. Casebook: Jack the Ripper W. H. Smith, on the floor of the House of Commons, stated that Anderson \\"had discharged his duties with great ability and perfect faithfulness to the public.\\" Raymond Blathwayt, in Great Thoughts, wrote: \\"Sir Robert Anderson is one of the men to whom the country, without knowing it, owes a great debt.\\" Anderson and his wife are buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

The ship spent most of her pre-World War II career assigned to the China Station. Shortly after the war began in August 1939, she was assigned to search for German commerce raiders in the Indian Ocean. Cornwall was transferred to the South Atlantic in late 1939 where she escorted convoys before returning to the Indian Ocean in 1941. She then sank the in May. After the start of the Pacific War in December 1941, she began escorting convoys until she was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in March 1942. The ship was sunk on 5 April by dive bombers from three Japanese aircraft carriers during the Indian Ocean Raid. Description Cornwall displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving four shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by eight Admiralty 3-drum boilers. Cornwall carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship's complement was 784 officers and men.Raven and Roberts, pp. 123, 412‚Äì13 The ship mounted eight 50-calibre 8-inch (203 mm) guns in four twin gun turrets. Her secondary armament consisted of four QF Mk V anti-aircraft (AA) guns in single mounts. Cornwall mounted four single 2-pounder (40 mm) light AA guns (\\"pom-poms\\"). The ship carried two quadruple torpedo tube above-water mounts for torpedoes.Raven and Roberts, p. 412 Cornwall was only lightly protected with little more than a single inch of plating protecting vital machinery. Her magazines were the exception and were protected by of armour. Space and weight was reserved for one aircraft catapult and its seaplane, but they were not fitted until after she was completed.Raven and Roberts, pp. 251, 412 Construction and career Cornwall, the fifth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy,Colledge, p. 79 was named after the eponymous county. The ship was laid down at Devonport Dockyard on 9 October 1924 and was launched on 11 March 1926. Completed on 6 December 1927, she was assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron (CS) on the China Station and spent the bulk of the interbellum period there.Whitley, pp. 83, 86 In 1929‚Äì30 she received a High- Angle Control System, used to direct her anti-aircraft guns, and a catapult was fitted the following year. Two quadruple Vickers .50-calibre (12.7 mm) Mark III machine guns were added in 1934.Raven and Roberts, p. 251 In July 1936, Cornwall returned home to begin a major refit, which included a Krupp cemented armour belt abreast the engine and boiler rooms as well as the dynamo room and the fire control transmitting station. This belt extended down from the lower deck. Four inches of armour were also added to protect the sides of the boiler room fan compartments. A hangar for her aircraft was added and a new, more powerful catapult was installed. The ship's director was moved to the roof of the hangar and a new power-operated director-control tower was installed in its original location. Her single four-inch AA guns were replaced with twin-gun mounts for Mark XVI guns of the same calibre. Two octuple-barrel 2-pounder mounts were added abreast the searchlight tower and the original 2-pounder guns were removed. The changes raised the ship's displacement by and cost an estimated ¬£215,000.Raven and Roberts, pp. 244, 251 After the refit was completed in December 1937, the ship was assigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron before rejoining the 5th CS in 1939.Whitley, p. 86 On 5 October 1939, a month after the start of World War II, she was assigned to Force I to hunt for German commerce raiders in the Indian Ocean and spent most of the rest of the year there. Cornwall was then transferred to the South Atlantic for convoy escort duties. On 13 September 1940, the ship rendezvoused with a convoy that was carrying troops intended to capture Dakar from the Vichy French, but was detached to intercept the Vichy French light cruiser that was escorting an oil tanker to Libreville, French Equatorial Africa, five days later and forced them to return to Casablanca in French Morocco. She then returned to the Indian Ocean and sank the German commerce raider on 8 May 1941. Cornwall rescued 3 officers, 57 ratings and 22 prisoners after the battle.Rohwer, pp. 38, 40, 42, 72 Dorsetshire (background) and Cornwall under air attack by Japanese aircraft, 5 April 1942 After the start of the Pacific War on 7 December, the ship began escorting convoys across the Indian Ocean, examples being Convoy JS.1 from Colombo, Ceylon, to the Dutch East Indies in late January‚Äìearly February 1942Gill, 1957, p. 563 and the troop Convoy MS. 5 to Australia in early March. Later that month, she was assigned to the fast Force A of the Eastern Fleet.Rohwer, p. 148 On 2 April, Cornwall and her half sister, , were detached from the fleet, Dorsetshire to resume an interrupted refit and Cornwall to escort convoy SU-4 (composed of the U.S. Army transport and Australian transport ) to Australia and the aircraft carrier to Trincomalee in Ceylon for repairs. On 4 April, the Japanese fleet was spotted and the two cruisers left harbour and, after a hurried refuelling at sea, set out for Addu Atoll shortly after midnight. The following day, the two cruisers were sighted by a spotter plane from the about 200 miles (370 km) south-west of Ceylon.Gill 1968, pp. 16, 18 As part of the engagement known as the Easter Sunday Raid, a wave of Aichi D3A dive bombers took off from three Japanese carriers to attack Cornwall and Dorsetshire, south-west of Ceylon, and sank the two ships.

Taxonomy Giant pouched rats are only distantly related to the true rats, although until recently they had been placed in the same family, Muridae. Recent molecular studies, however, place them in the family Nesomyidae, part of an ancient radiation of African and Malagasy muroids. The name \\"pouched rat\\" refers to their large cheek pouches. The species are: *Southern giant pouched rat, Cricetomys ansorgei *Emin's pouched rat, Cricetomys emini *Gambian pouched rat, Cricetomys gambianus *Kivu giant pouched rat, Cricetomys kivuensis Behaviour Females have been said to be capable of producing up to 10 litters yearly. Gestation is 27‚Äì36 days. One to five young are born at a time. Females have eight nipples. The animals are nocturnal. They are omnivorous, and feed on vegetation and small animals, especially insects. They have a particular taste for palm nuts. Like many related rodents that are hind gut fermenters, they are coprophagous, voiding soft fecal pellets of semidigested food that they eat directly from the anus. Interaction with humans In many African countries, giant pouched rats are valued as an important food item. They are easily tamed as pets. However, they were associated with an outbreak of monkeypox in the USA in 2003 and have since been banned from importation to the U.S.. A HeroRAT finds a land mine in a training field in Morogoro, Tanzania =Detecting explosives and tuberculosis by scent= These rats are also becoming useful in some areas for detecting land mines: their acute sense of smell is very effective in detecting explosives such as TNT, and at the same time they are light enough to not detonate any of the mines.Giant rats sniff out Mozambique's mines. IOL (29 January 2009) The rats are being trained by APOPO, a nonprofit social venture based in Tanzania. The procedure for training rats to detect land mines was conceived of and developed by Belgian Bart Weetjens. Training starts at four weeks of age when the rats are handled to accustom them to humans and exposed to a variety of sights and sounds. They learn to associate a clicker with a food reward of banana or banana-peanut paste. They are then trained to indicate a hole which contains TNT by nosing it for five seconds. Then they learn to find the correct hole in a line of holes. Finally, the rat is trained to wear a harness and practises outdoors on a lead, finding inactive mines under soil. At the end of their training, they are tested: they must find all the mines in an area of that has been seeded with inactivated mines. It is a blind test: their handlers do not know where the mines are. If they succeed, they are certified as bomb-sniffing rats.Weetjens, Bart. How I taught rats to sniff out land mines, TED Talks, Rotterdam, 2010 (accessed 16 September 2011) APOPO is also training the rats to detect tuberculosis by sniffing sputum samples. The rats can test many more samples than can a scientist‚Äîhundreds in a day, compared with 30 to 40 by traditional methods. Land mine and tuberculosis sniffing rats are called HeroRats.

Suffrage is universal for citizens 18 and over, and under applicable election laws. In national elections, political party participation is mainly restricted to the lower house of Parliament, and by extension, to the executive nominated by its majority. Bhutan has a national bicameral parliamentary legislature. The National Assembly of Bhutan is the lower house of Parliament and has 47 members. The maximum number of seats at any time is 55, with each member representing a single-seat constituency. Between 2008 and 2013, 45 seats were won by the ruling Bhutan Peace and Prosperity Party (DPT) and 2 were taken by the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP). The National Council of Bhutan, the upper house of Parliament, has 20 nonpartisan members popularly elected by each dzongkhag and 5 members appointed by the King of Bhutan. The National Council member was first elected on 31 December 2007. Bhutan also conducts elections for offices in local governments. Dzongkhags (districts), Gewogs (village blocks), and Thromdes (municipalities), all elect members of local administrative governments with varying degrees of authority. Prior to 2007, Bhutan had a unicameral national parliament known as the Tshogdu.

The Constitution provides a bare substantive and procedural framework, incorporating then-existing election laws insofar as they did not conflict. Notably, religious figures and institutions must remain above (out of) politics. The Election Act of 2008, the most comprehensive of Bhutan's election laws, was passed by Parliament on July 28, 2008, and came into force on August 12, 2008, repealing all previous laws on elections to Parliament and Local Governments.Election Act 2008: Preamble; ¬ß¬ß 1, 2 The Election Act of 2008 is the latest Bhutanese legislation codifying substantive and procedural laws on constituencies, political parties and their candidates, campaigns, elections, electoral oversight, and suffrage.

Among the offenses listed are those related to breach of code of conduct, conducting exit polls, sale of alcohol during polling periods, and broadcasting political messages from outside Bhutan (misdemeanors) to making and accepting illegal contributions, influencing Commissions, canvassing poll places, campaigning or holding public gatherings within 48 hours of a poll (fourth degree felonies).Election Act 2008: ¬ß¬ß 276, 324, 325, 344, 518‚Äì564 Election-related issues Bhutan faces some obstacles in its implementation of its envisaged fully participatory democracy. Citizens' participation in voting and running for office, delayed elections, electoral rolls, and voters' confidence in electronic voting machines (EVMs), have been notable issues in Bhutanese elections. Candidacy requirements including security clearance and extensive competence, legal, and documentary showings have served to dwindle numbers of available local government cadres. As a result, local government elections slated for 2008 were delayed until 2011. The political, though not electoral, landscape is largely male-dominated. Furthermore, other aspects of the Bhutanese legal landscape, from the Constitution to citizenship legislation, shape election- related issues in Bhutan. =Delayed elections and government action= Between 2008 and 2011, delayed and staggered elections for local level government has resulted in an inability to form quora on the Dzongkhag, Gewog, and Thromde levels. Although elections were originally slated for 2008, various participatory hurdles, demarcation problems, and legal questions posed by the Election Commission regarding the constitutionality of election laws produced significant delays. Although demarcation is a basic requisite for the determination of electoral rolls, the task presented particular difficulty for the government. The electoral rolls themselves, and requirements behind registration, served to lower the level of participation. =Electoral rolls= Because of electoral rolls reflect census data on citizenship and origin, many would-be voters in 2011 were legally registered in Dzongkhags and Chiwogs other than where they reside. This is especially true in urban areas such as Thimphu, where some 6,000 were eligible to vote out of a population of over 86,000. =Participation= Between 2008 and 2011, recruitment and retention of Tshogpas, or local government council members, remained a serious issue. Obstacles range from lack of interest and lack of economic incentives to difficulty in compliance and obtaining accreditation under existing election laws. The functional literacy and skills test alone left many constituencies without the minimum of two candidates, leading to lengthy delay of the local government elections of 2011, originally slated for 2008. The first round of the functional literacy and skills test left many Gewogs with no representatives, though second round results showed a pass rate over 90%. Although women elected to office remained relatively few (14% before local elections according to the UNHCR), more than half of voters in initial local government elections were women. In initial local-level voting in 2011, voter turnout was about 50%. This has raised the question of whether women would benefit from quotas in public service, highlighting the need to encourage further female electoral and political participation. In contrast, many lay monks and former lay monks, facing Constitutional hurdles in voting as well as registering and certifying as candidates, have actively sought to participate in elections and government since democratization. =Electronic voting machines= In its elections, Bhutan uses 4,000 electronic voting machines (EVMs) produced in Hyderabad and Bangalore, India. The EVMs were used in National Assembly elections, National Council elections, and local elections. An incident of tampering similar EVMs in India had put their security into question, however the Chief Election Commissioner assured the public that last-minute randomized EVM distribution and adequate backup machines prevented tampering. =Proposed amendments= In 2012, amendments were proposed that would change government funding of the ruling and opposition parties, oversight by the executive and parliament, and restrictions on partisan status. These amendments failed to gain the required endorsements of two- thirds of parliament, and were tabled without public deliberation.

The National Assembly is mostly directly elected, and in turn elects the President and some of its own members. The Ntlo ya Dikgosi is a mixture of appointed, hereditary and indirectly elected members.Botswana CIA World Handbook Electoral history Following the creation of the Bechuanaland Protectorate in 1889, the first elections took place in the territory at the start of the 1920s, following the establishment of the European Advisory Council (EAC) and the Native Advisory Council (NAC). Members of the EAC were elected in single-member constituencies by British citizens (or those who could qualify for British citizenship) with European parentage, and who met residency and wealth requirements.Bechuanaland Protectorate, 1932 Colonial Reports It was first elected in 1921, with elections held every three years. Initially it had four members, increasing to six in 1929 and eight in 1948.Fred Morton, Jeff Ramsay, Part Themba Mgadla (2008) Historical Dictionary of Botswana, Scarecrow Press, p83 The Native Advisory Council initially consisted of 30 members, five from each of the southern tribes (the Rolong, Kw√™na, Bangwaketse, Kgatla, Bamalete and the Tl√¥kwa). One of the five members had to be the tribe's chief, but the other four members were elected by the tribes \\"according to their customs\\". However, this system was criticised by some members, including SM Molema, who claimed that chiefs were picking their favourites. The Resident Commissioner noted that his understanding was that members would be elected in kgotlas (traditional assemblies).Kenneth R. D. Manungo (1999) The role of the Native Advisory Council in the Bechuanaland Protectorate, 1919-1960 Pula: Botswana Journal of African Studies, vol. 13, nos. 1 & 2 In 1937 the system was changed to allow the Resident Commissioner to select one representative for each tribe. In 1940 it was renamed the African Advisory Council (AAC), and in 1944 its membership was changed to reflect the population of the tribes. The AAC was enlarged to 35 members, with eight from the Bangwato, four from the Bangwaketse and Kw√™na, three from the Rolong, the Bamalete, Tl√¥kwa, Kgatla and the Tawana, two from the Kgalagadi and two representing the Francistown area. In 1950 a Joint Advisory Council was created, with eight representatives from each of the EAC and the AAC and three nominated members. Towards the end of the 1950s, pressures to create a Legislative Council eventually led to a proclamation in December 1960 that the EAC and AAC would be dissolved in April 1961, and two new bodies, a Legislative Council and African Council, would be elected. The new Legislative Council had eleven directly elected members, ten of which were elected by Europeans and one by the Asian population. There were also ten indirectly elected African members, who were chosen by the African Council, as well as ten colonial officials and some co-opted members. The African Council was partly elected, with elected members sitting alongside the leaders of the eight chiefdoms.Botswana: Late British colonialism (1945-1966) EISA The first elections held under universal suffrage took place in 1965, prior to independence 18 months later. The Bechuanaland Democratic Party (renamed the Botswana Democratic Party following independence) won a landslide victory, taking 28 of the 31 seats. Following independence, the BDP went on to claim landslide victories in 1969, 1974, 1979 and 1984, winning at least three-quarters of the seats in every election. A referendum on electoral reform was held in 1987, but it only involved the creation of the post of Supervisor of Elections, and the first-past-the-post system that allowed the BDP to dominate the National Assembly remained in place. After another landslide victory in 1989, the 1994 elections saw the best performance by an opposition party, as the Botswana National Front (BNF) won 13 of the 40 elected seats, although the BDP still held two-thirds of the seats. A second electoral reform referendum was held in 1997 following violent protests in 1995.Botswana: Constitutional and electoral reform EISA The reforms included the creation of an Independent Electoral Commission, allowing Batswana living abroad to vote, and lowering the vote age from 21 to 18, with all three approved by voters. The 1999 elections saw the BDP win 33 of the 40 elected seats, following a split in the BNF in 1998. It went on to win 44 of the 57 elected seats in 2004, 45 seats in 2009 and 37 seats in 2014. Electoral system =National Assembly= The 63 members of the National Assembly include 57 members elected for five-year terms in single member constituencies using first-past-the-post voting, four members elected by the National Assembly from a list provided by the President, and two ex officio members; the President and the Attorney General.National Assembly IPUThe Parliament of Botswana CPA Since independence, the size of the National Assembly has gradually been increased; with the number of elected members increasing from 31 to 32 in 1974, 34 in 1984, 40 in 1994 and 57 in 2004.Dieter Nohlen, Michael Krennerich & Bernard Thibaut (1999) Elections in Africa: A Data Handbook, Oxford University Press, p105Elections held in 2004 IPU The presence of indirectly elected members began in 1974.Elections in Botswana African Elections Database Voters must be Batswana citizens aged 18 or over, have continuously resided in the country for at least 12 months prior to voter registration.

Until 2005 it consisted of the eight chiefs of the country's main tribes, four members elected from amongst themselves by chiefs of other tribes, and three further members elected by the 12 existing members. In 2005 it was expanded to consist of 35 members, comprising the eight chiefs, five members appointed by the President, and 22 members elected by regional electoral colleges from paid tribal chiefs every five years.Ntlo Ya Dikgosi Introduction Parliament of Botswana Referendums Three national referendums have been held in Botswana. The first was held in 1987 on reforms to the electoral system, with a second referendum on the same subject in 1997. The third referendum was held in 2001 on proposed reforms to the judicial system. Voters were asked a total of eight questions, and voter turnout was just 4.9%.Botswana: 2001 Referendum EISA References External links *Botswana Independent Electoral Commission *Botswana Adam Carr's Election Archive *Botswana Africa Elections Database ","title":"Elections in Botswana"},{"id":"1359710","text":"Bulgaria elects on national level a head of state - the president - and a legislature. The president is elected for a five-year term directly by the people. The National Assembly (Narodno Sabranie) has 240 members, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation in multi-seat constituencies with a 4% threshold. Bulgaria has a multi-party system, in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each to form governments. Parliamentary elections Parliamentary elections have been held in Bulgaria since 1879. There was a period when partisan politics was banned from 1934 to 1944; in the wake of the Bulgarian coup d'√©tat of 1934 and the sequential personal rule of Tsar Boris III. There was also period of single party system between 1945 and 1989, during the People's Republic of Bulgaria, during which only candidates sanctioned by authorities could run. This, in practice, gave the Bulgarian Communist Party and its collaborators a monopoly on power. Until 1945 there was no universal suffrage for the women. The table below show the elections since 1990, when the government became a democratic republic. All elections since 1990 have had 240 members, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation in multi-seat constituencies with a 4% threshold. The two elections that differed from this model was the 1990 Grand National Assembly election, where 400 representatives were elected: half by proportional representation and half by first-past-the- post voting. The other exception was the 2009 election when 209 representatives were elected by proportional representation and 31 through first past the post; seats corresponding to the provinces and the largest cities. =Recent elections=  Presidential election  Presidential elections have been held since 1992. From 1996 onwards, presidential elections have been held every five years.

He is a Visiting Professor at the Department of War Studies, King's College London, a Roger and Martha Mertz Visiting Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and a Lehrman Institute Distinguished Lecturer at the New York Historical Society. He has been a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery, London since 2013. Roberts was educated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he earned a first-class degree in Modern History. His public commentary has appeared in several periodicals such as The Daily Telegraph and The Spectator. Roberts himself is possibly best known internationally for his 2009 non-fiction work The Storm of War, which covers historical factors of the Second World War such as Hitler's rise to power and the organisation of Nazi Germany. The book has been lauded by several publications such as The Economist, and it additionally received the British Army Military Book of the Year Award for 2010. Much of Roberts' work, including his 2018 biography of Winston Churchill, has been widely praised; the Sunday Times, for example, called the Churchill biography 'Undoubtedly the best single-volume life of Churchill ever written.' Elsewhere, his work has sometimes been criticised by, for example, The Economist who described one book as \\"a giant political pamphlet larded with its author's prejudices, with sneers at those who do not share them and with errors\\". Early life and education Roberts was born in Hammersmith, west London, the son of Kathleen () and business executive Simon Roberts. Simon Roberts, from Cobham, Surrey, inherited the Job's Dairy milk business and also owned the United Kingdom contingent of Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants. A prolific reader as a child, he soon gained a passion for history, particularly for dramatic works relating to \\"battles, wars, assassinations and death\\". Roberts attended Cranleigh School in Surrey. He studied at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and he went on to chair the Cambridge University Conservative Association. He earned a first class honours B.A. degree in Modern History. Roberts began his career in corporate finance as an investment banker and private company director with the London merchant bank Robert Fleming & Co., where he worked from 1985 to 1988. He published his first historical book in 1991. Personal life Roberts is divorced from his first wife, Camilla Henderson, with whom he had two children. Roberts is married to businesswoman Susan Gilchrist, CEO of the corporate communications firm Brunswick Group LLP and chairman of the South Bank Centre. They currently live in London. Roberts has worked with think tank organisations such as the Centre for Policy Studies and the Centre for Social Cohesion. He additionally has maintained personal friendships with several British political and social figures such as David Cameron, Michael Gove and Oliver Letwin. In February 2016, he was appointed President of the Cambridge University Conservative Association. Historical and socio-political viewpoints =Commentary on history= Roberts' analysis of the Second World War convinced him that the Nazi German government had significant advantages in military organisation and economic power early in the war. He has argued that, if someone other than Adolf Hitler had control of the nation's military strategy, the country would likely have forgone a costly direct invasion of Soviet territory (which occurred through Operation Barbarossa) and instead would have swept through Mediterranean territories before trying to seal off British-controlled Middle East areas. Thus, Roberts believes, the likely morale-building victories against the comparatively weak forces to the southeast could have allowed Hitler to essentially \\"win\\" the war. The other key strategic mistake, according to Roberts, was the German declaration of war against the United States, which happened only four days after the Pearl Harbor attacks and which the Nazi regime was not obliged to do. Roberts argues that after the declaration, Germany could not keep the U.S. war-making economic machine at bay. In short, Roberts believes that the mistakes, delusions and exaggerated self-confidence complexes that the fascist dictatorship fostered proved its undoing. Roberts has also stated that he views Joseph Stalin's control of the Soviet forces as having been disastrous to the allied efforts against the Axis powers. He noted that Stalin's obsessive tactics of killing his own men for ideological reasons cost him thousands upon thousands of troops. In the Battle of Stalingrad alone, Soviet forces killed the equivalent of two full divisions of their own personnel. In terms of more recent history, Roberts whole-heartedly embraced Thatcherism. He has remained a staunch backer of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her socio-political legacy. In Roberts' opinion, Thatcher's insight to push the UK into a path in which it kept out of the Euro while still having strong ties to European economies has been validated by the Eurozone crisis in the aftermath of the world economic recession. After Tony Blair resigned as Prime Minister, Roberts assessed him as an \\"exemplary war leader\\" with his \\"vigorous prosecution of the War against Terror\\", which would leave him regarded as a \\"highly successful prime minister\\". In the 2016 UK Referendum on the EU, Roberts backed a Leave vote. =Support for the Iraq War and Military Intervention= Roberts supports a strong American military and has generally argued in favour of close relations between the Anglosphere nations. As an advocate for the general principle of democratic pluralism, he has argued that \\"[s]neered at for being 'simplistic' in his reaction to 9/11, Bush's visceral responses to the attacks of a fascistic, totalitarian death cult will be seen as having been substantially the right ones\\" in the long run. In many writings, he has come out in support of neo-conservative influenced socio- political viewpoints. During the buildup to the Iraq War, Roberts supported the proposed invasion, arguing that anything less would be tantamount to appeasement, comparing Tony Blair to Winston Churchill in his \\"astonishing leadership\\". He additionally argued that acting against Saddam Hussein was in line with the \\"Pax Americana realpolitik that has kept the great powers at peace since the Second World War, despite the collapse of communism\\". Roberts wrote in 2003 \\"For Churchill, apotheosis came in 1940; for Tony Blair, it will come when Iraq is successfully invaded and hundreds of weapons of mass destruction are unearthed from where they have been hidden by Saddam's henchmen.\\" When such weapons were not found, Roberts still defended the invasion for larger strategic reasons while arguing that his past views were based on credible assessments from \\"the French, Chinese, Israeli and Russian intelligence agencies\\" as well as other sources. Authorship and television appearances =Early works= The first of Roberts' books was the biography of Neville Chamberlain's and Winston Churchill's foreign secretary, Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax, entitled The Holy Fox, and published in 1991. Roberts provided a revisionist account of Wood, a one-time Viceroy of India and the Foreign Secretary in Chamberlain's government. Halifax has been charged with appeasement, along with Chamberlain, but Roberts argues that Halifax in fact began to move his government away from that policy vis-√†-vis Hitler's Germany, following the 1938 Munich Crisis. This work was followed by Eminent Churchillians, in 1994, a collection of essays about friends and enemies of Churchill. A large part of the book is an attack on Admiral of the Fleet Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma and other prominent members of the elite. The title is an obvious allusion to the famous and similarly combative book of biographies Eminent Victorians. In 1995 Roberts published The Aachen Memorandum, a thriller novel based on Britain and its relationship with a fictionalised European Union. In 1996 Andrew Roberts offered his \\"personal view\\" of the Suez crisis in an Open Media production for BBC TV. The Radio Times described the programme: \\"Forty years after Eden's decision to deploy troops against the Egyptians, Andrew Roberts argues that the former prime minister should be congratulated, not chastised, for fighting to protect British assets\\".Radio Times, 23 October 1996 In 1999, Roberts published Salisbury: Victorian Titan, a biography of the Victorian era politician and then Prime Minister Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury. Historian Michael Korda praised the work as \\"a masterpiece about one of the greatest and most able Tory political figures of the Victorian age\\". The book additionally won the Wolfson History Prize and the James Stern Silver Pen Award for Non-Fiction. In September 2001, Napoleon and Wellington, an investigation into the relationship between the two generals, was published by Weidenfeld and Nicolson, and was the subject of the lead review in all but one of Britain's national newspapers. January 2003 saw the publication of Hitler and Churchill: Secrets of Leadership. In the book, which addresses the leadership techniques of Hitler and Churchill, he delivered a rebuttal to many of the assertions made by Clive Ponting and Christopher Hitchens concerning Churchill. An accompanying television series based around Roberts' Hitler and Churchill ran on BBC2, with its first episode being broadcast on 7 March 2013. Roberts remarked that he felt grateful for the BBC's support of his work and their unwillingness to cut corners when it came to exploring history in detail, quipping as well about the group's wardrobe policy, \\"Courtesy of this programme, I now have two Armani suits upstairs.\\" Also in 2003, he became a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. In 2004, he edited What Might Have Been, a collection of twelve \\"What If?\\" essays written by historians and journalists, including Robert Cowley, Antonia Fraser, Norman Stone, Amanda Foreman, Simon Sebag Montefiore, Lord Black of Crossharbour and Anne Somerset. In 2005, Roberts published Waterloo: Napoleon's Last Gamble, which was published in America as Waterloo: The Battle for Modern Europe. His A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900, a sequel to the four volume work of Churchill, was published in September 2006 and won the Intercollegiate Studies Institute Book Award. Masters and Commanders describes how four figures shaped the strategy of the West during the Second World War. It was published in November, 2008 and won the International Churchill Society Book Award and was shortlisted for two other military history book prizes. The Art of War is a two-volume chronological survey of the greatest military commanders in history. It was compiled by a team of historians, including Robin Lane Fox, Tom Holland, John Julius Norwich, Jonathan Sumption and Felipe Fern√°ndez-Armesto, working under the general editorship of Roberts. =Overview of the Second World War= The Storm of War: A New History of the Second World War came out in August 2009. A detailed look at the history of events behind the Second World War and various key elements within it such as the nature of Nazi Germany's rule, the book received large popular success. and reached number two in The Sunday Times bestseller list. The book additionally earned the British Army Military Book of the Year award for 2010. In terms of critical response, The Storm of War has also received a wide variety of praise in publications such as The Daily Beast, where historian Michael Korda lauded it as written \\"superbly well\\" and stated that Roberts' \\"scholarship is superb\\", and The Wall Street Journal, where historian Jonathan W. Jordan said that Roberts \\"splendidly weaves a human tragedy into a story\\". Support also came from figures such as American political commentator Peter Robinson and fellow English historian Paul Johnson. In the book, the author aims to paint a concise yet highly detailed picture of the conflict in which he argues that dictators Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler both took terrible actions due to their repressive ideologies, throwing thousands and thousands of lives away in the process, yet the eventual defeat of the Axis powers constituted a moral triumph of democratic pluralism over authoritarianism that led the way to a better future. =Biography of Napoleon= In 2014, Roberts wrote Napoleon the Great (the American edition is titled Napoleon: A Life), which was awarded the 2015 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for best biography. In this biography, Roberts seeks to evoke Napoleon's tremendous energy, both physical and intellectual, and the attractiveness of his personality, even to his enemies. The book argues against many long-held historical opinions, including the myth of a great romance with Jos√©phine. She took a lover immediately after their marriage, as Roberts shows, and Napoleon in fact had three times as many mistresses as he acknowledged. Roberts goes through fifty- three of Napoleon's sixty battlefields, and he additionally evaluates a gigantic new French edition of Napoleon's letters, aiming to create a complete re-evaluation of the man. Like The Storm of War, Roberts's life of Napoleon received critical praise from a wide range of publications. For example, journalist Jeremy Jennings wrote for Standpoint in October 2014 that \\"Napoleon could have had few biographers more dedicated to their subject.\\" Jennings additionally labelled the book a \\"richly detailed and sure-footed reappraisal of the man, his achievements‚Äîand failures‚Äîand the extraordinary times in which he lived\\". The book earned the Prix du Jury des Grands Prix de la Fondation Napol√©on for 2014, an award given by the historical organisation Fondation Napol√©on. Praise additionally came from fellow historian Jay Winik: 'With his customary flair and keen historical eye, Andrew Roberts has delivered the goods again. This could well be the best single volume biography of Napoleon in English for the last four decades. A tour de force that belongs on every history-lover's bookshelf!‚Äô Author of historical fiction Bernard Cornwell describes the book as 'Simply dynamite ... [Napoleon was] a mass of contradictions and Roberts's book encompasses all the evidence to give a brilliant portrait of the man. The book, as it needs to be, is massive, yet the pace is brisk and it's never overwhelmed by the scholarly research, which was plainly immense ... Roberts suggests looking at Europe for the Emperor's monument, but this magnificent biography is not a bad place to start.' In announcing in 2013 that it would present a three-part television series based on Roberts's analysis of Napoleon's life and legacy, BBC Two declared in its press release that \\"Roberts sets out to shed new light on the emperor... an extraordinary, gifted military commander and a mesmeric leader whose private life was littered with disappointments and betrayals.\\" However, the series has had mixed reviews. The Daily Telegraph declared it \\"unconvincing\\", saying \\"there was no getting away from Roberts‚Äôs regular lapses into hero-worship,\\" and \\"Roberts‚Äôs remarks on the refreshing qualities of dictatorship made me wonder if he had taken leave of his senses\\". =Churchill biography= In 2018, Roberts produced a biography of Churchill entitled Churchill: Walking with Destiny. Dovetailing with Roberts' previous work on the Second World War and its related major figures, the book received praise from a number of publications. The Financial Times wrote, \\"Anecdotes sparkle like gems throughout Roberts‚Äôs book, an exhaustive but fluent text that draws on a wider range of sources than the typical Churchill biography.\\" Andrew Rawnsley in The Observer included the book among the 'Books of the Year' and said that \\"Roberts triumphed over my skepticism with his riveting account of the extraordinary life of the most remarkable individual to have lived at No 10.\\" Stephen Pollard, in The Jewish Chronicle, lauded the book as \\"the most superb one-volume biography I have ever read‚Äî of anyone.\\" Pollard additionally remarked, \\"Roberts manages something I thought impossible. He has given us a new, ground-breaking portrait of the man whom many consider to be the greatest ever Englishman. This is a simply wonderful book. A living, poetic, stirring yet thought-provoking portrait of a giant, it will be regarded as a classic for generations to come.\\" The New York Times commented that 'All told, it must surely be the best single-volume biography of Churchill yet written.' The National Book Review also noted that the book was 'widely praised as the best single-volume biography of Winston Churchill ever written' and added that 'historian and commentator Roberts draws on previously unavailable journals and notes for the robust, engrossing, and nuanced history of the great British leader.'. Journalism and lecturing Roberts has created short works on a variety of subjects, his published columns appearing in popular periodicals such as The Daily Telegraph and The Spectator, amongst others. In addition, since 1990, Roberts has addressed hundreds of institutional and academic audiences in many countries, including a lecture to George W. Bush at the White House. Roberts has appeared on US television during royal funerals and weddings. He first came to prominence in the United States due to acting as an expert on the funeral of Princess Diana, in 1997, and he was later in a similar role during the CNN broadcast of the death of the Queen Mother and on the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. In Britain in 2003, he presented The Secrets of Leadership, a four-part history series on BBC 2 about the secrets of leadership which looked at the different leadership styles of Churchill, Hitler, John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. Roberts is a Director of the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation in New York, a founder member of Jos√© Maria Aznar's Friends of Israel Initiative, and in 2010 chaired the Hessell-Tiltman Award for Non-Fiction. Roberts is a judge on the Elizabeth Longford Historical Biography Prize. He chaired the Conservative Party's Advisory Panel on the Teaching of History in Schools in 2005, and is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He has also been elected a Fellow of the Napoleonic Institute and an Honorary Member of the International Churchill Society (UK). He is a Trustee of the Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust and of the Roberts Foundation.Andrew Roberts web-site During the autumn of 2013, Roberts served as the inaugural Merrill Family visiting professor in history at Cornell University. He taught a course entitled \\"Great European Leaders of the 19th and 20th Centuries and their Influence on History.\\" He's additionally spoke in many other American universities such as the University of Montana. Disputes and criticisms Although Roberts's 2006 work A History of the English-Speaking Peoples since 1900 won critical acclaim from some sections of the media, The Economist drew attention to some historical, geographical and typographical errors, as well presenting a generally scathing review of the book. The newspaper referred to the work as \\"a giant political pamphlet larded with its author's prejudices\\". More generally, Reba Soffer described him in 2009 as \\"devoted ...to public, polemical conservatism as well as to historical revisionism\\". One claim made by Roberts in A History of the English-Speaking Peoples since 1900 was that Harvard historian Caroline Elkins had committed \\"blood libels against Britain\\" in her Pulitzer prize-winning book Imperial Reckoning: The Untold Story of Britain's Gulag in Kenya. Elkins was subsequently vindicated when files released by the National Archives showed that abuses were described as \\"distressingly reminiscent of conditions in Nazi Germany or Communist Russia\\" by the Solicitor General of the time. The Foreign Secretary William Hague subsequently announced compensation for the first round of victims with statements that the British government \\"recognises that Kenyans were subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment\\" and \\"sincerely regrets that these abuses took place\\" during the Kenya Emergency. Journalist Johann Hari alleged that Roberts' writings defended the Amritsar massacre, the concentration camps for Afrikaners during the Anglo-Boer War and mass internments in Ireland. Hari also wrote that Roberts addressed the expatriate South African Springbok Club that flies the pre-1994 South African national flag and calls for \\"the re-establishment of civilised rule throughout the African continent\\". Roberts responded by saying that he did not realise the Springbok Club was racist when he took on the speaking engagement.

Specifically, this consists mostly of exopolysaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids. Therefore, the slime layer is considered as a subset of glycocalyx. While slime layers and capsules are found most commonly in bacteria, while rare, these structures do exist in archaea as well. This information about structure and function is also transferable to these microorganisms too.  Structure  Slime layers are amorphous and inconsistent in thickness, being produced in various quantities depending upon the cell type and environment. These layers present themselves as strands hanging extracellularly and forming net-like structures between cells that were 1-4Œºm apart. Researchers suggested that a cell will slow formation of the slime layer after around 9 days of growth, perhaps due to slower metabolic activity. A bacterial capsule is similar, but is more rigid than the slime layer. Capsules are more organized and difficult to remove compared to their slime layer counterparts. Another highly organized, but separate structure is an S-layer. S-layers are structures that integrate themselves into the cell wall and are composed of glycoproteins, these layers can offer the cell rigidity and protection. Because a slime layer is loose and flowing, it does not aide the cell in its rigidity. While biofilms can be composed of slime layer producing bacteria, it is not typically not their main composition. Rather, a biofilm is made up of an array of microorganisms that come together to form a cohesive biofilm. Although, there are homogeneous biofilms that can form. For example, the plaque that forms on the surfaces of teeth is caused by a biofilm formation of primarily Streptococcus mutans and the slow breakdown of tooth enamel.  Cellular function  The function of the slime layer is to protect the bacteria cells from environmental dangers such as antibiotics and desiccation. The slime layer allows bacteria to adhere to smooth surfaces such as prosthetic implants and catheters, as well as other smooth surfaces like petri-dishes. Researchers found that the cells adhered themselves to the culture vessel without additional appendages, relying on the extracellular material alone. While consisting mostly of polysaccharides, a slime layer may be over produced such that in a time of famine the cell can rely on the slime layer as extra food storage to survive. In addition, a slime layer may be produced in ground dwelling prokaryotes to prevent unnecessary drying due to annual temperature and humidity shifts. It may permit bacterial colonies to survive chemical sterilization with chlorine, iodine, and other chemicals, leaving autoclaving or flushing with boiling water as the only certain methods of decontaminating. Some bacteria have shown a protective response to attacks from the immune system by using their slime layers to absorb antibodies. Additionally, some bacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus anthracis can produce biofilm structures that are effective against phagocyte attacks from the host immune system. This type of biofilm formation increases their virulence factor as they are more likely to survive within a host's body, although this type of biofilm is typically associated with capsules.  Research  Because of the abundance of so many bacteria that are increasing their resistance to antimicrobial agents such as antibiotics (these products inhibit cell growth or just kill the cell), there is new research coming out about new drugs that reduce virulence factors in some bacteria. Anti-virulent drugs reduce the pathogenic properties in bacteria, allowing the host to attack said bacteria, or allows antimicrobial agents to work. Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogenic bacteria that causes several human infections with a plethora of virulence factors such as: biofilm formation, quorum sensing, and exotoxins to name a few. Researchers took a look at Myricetin (Myr) as a multi-anti-virulence agent against S.areus and how it specifically impacts biofilm formation. After regular dosing it was found that biofilm formation decreased and the number of adhered cells on their specified media decreased without killing the cells. Myr is promising when surfaces are coated in the material, non-coated surfaces show a thick biofilm formation with a large quantity of cellular adherence; the coated material showed minimal cell clusters that were weakly adhered. A problem with concrete structures is the damage they receive during weather shifts, because if its porous nature there is an amount of water that can expand or contract the concrete depending on the environment. This damage makes these structures susceptible to sulfate attacks. Sulfate attacks occur when the sulfates in the concrete react to other salts formed by other sulfate sources and cause internal erosion of the concrete. The extra exposure to these sulfate (SO4) ions can be caused by road salt getting splashed onto the structure, soils that are high in sulfates are also an issue for these concrete structures. Research has shown that some aerobic slime forming bacteria may be able to help repair and maintain concrete structures. These bacteria act as a diffusion barrier from the external sulfates to the concrete. Researchers found that the thicker the layer the more effective it was, seeing almost a linear increase for the number of service years applicable to the concrete structure as the layer thickness increased. For long term repair of the structure, 60mm thickness of the slime layer should be used to ensure the longevity of the concrete structure, and to ensure the proper diffusion of sulfate ions.

The band's sound was a combination of industrial beats and hardcore punk, presaging what Ministry would later do with Jello Biafra in another side project, Lard. Background While Alain Jourgensen was living in London, he met Ian MacKaye. MacKaye had been in Washington D.C. punk bands The Teen Idles, Minor Threat, Skewbald/Grand Union, Egg Hunt and Embrace and was on the verge of forming Fugazi, while Jourgensen was taking his band Ministry into new territory‚Äîaway from the more pop sound of With Sympathy and toward the harder sound of The Land of Rape and Honey. The two found common ground both musically and politically and decided to collaborate on a project that would fuse elements of industrial music with hardcore punk. Pailhead released the single \\"I Will Refuse\\" / \\"No Bunny\\" (released in both 7\\" and 12\\" formats) in 1987 and the 4-song EP Trait in 1988, both on the Wax Trax! record label. The CD edition of Trait also incorporates both sides of the \\"I Will Refuse\\" / \\"No Bunny\\" single. The drummer for \\"No Bunny\\" was Eric Spicer of Naked Raygun. These tracks were later re-released on Ministry's odds-and-ends compilation Side Trax. MacKaye stated on an episode of the Kreative Kontrol podcast that he has never played live with the band. In popular culture * Chris Connelly's first work with Jourgensen was to record vocals for the track that would later emerge as \\"I Will Refuse.\\" Connelly released this version, which he called \\"Stick\\" and attributed to the Revolting Cocks, on his Initials C.C. album.

He continued his studies at Pavia University. During World War I, Crichton-Miller joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and served in the rank of lieutenant colonel. His concern for sufferers of Shell shock, led after the war to his founding a charitable clinic in Tavistock Square to treat nervous complaints. He remained its honorary medical director until 1934, followed by a further seven years as its honorary senior physician. By 1939 he was working alongside 90 honorary medical colleagues.

It is located northwest of Wolverhampton and is best described as a dormitory village for the city. It is from Bridgnorth and used to be within the now defunct Bridgnorth district; it is now part of the Shropshire Council unitary authority. The village has a railway station, which is on the Shrewsbury to Wolverhampton Line. Very close by is RAF Cosford and the M54 motorway. The village is the most easterly settlement in Shropshire. Immediately to the north is the hamlet and parish of Donington separated from Albrighton by Humphreston (Albrighton) Brook. History Mentioned in the Domesday Book as Albricston(e) or the home/farm of Albric/Aethelbeorht, it received its charter in 1303, which was renewed in 1662 for rather unusual reasons. The charter declared that \\"because Albrighton (then) adjoined Staffordshire on the east, south and west sides, felons and other malefactors fled Staffordshire to escape prosecution because there was no resident justice of the peace in that part of Shropshire\\". The church of St Mary Magdalene, Albrighton The parish church, dedicated to St Mary Magdalene was completed around 1181, and some rebuilding work was done in 1853. It is built of red sandstone in the Norman style. The church contains an alabaster monument to Sir Craig Wilson, as well as the Albrighton Mace donated to the village in 1663, by Lady Mary Talbot. The east window of the church dates from the 14th century. The church also contains the family tomb of the Talbot Family, including the final resting place of Charles Talbot and Francis Talbot, among others. The church is separated from the extremely close parish church of St Cuthbert (Donington) by Humphreston Brook. The story is that two sisters disagreed about the nature of the architecture of the church and so resolved to build their own churches right next to each other. Shops on Albrighton High St Humphreston BrookWhilst historically, the references point to this watercourse being called Humphreston Brook, more modern references label it as Albrighton Brook. The BBC refers to Albrighton Brook in its flooding in Albrighton report of 2006 and Severn Trent Water refer to the confluence of the brook at Cosford Bridge into the River Worfe as Albrighton Brook. It also lists the brook as starting at grid ref SJ803 047, which is just after the brook passes under Newport Road by the Fire Station was dammed by a local miller in the 17th century and it now provides the boundary between the two parishes and feeds into Donington Pool which is also part of the Donington and Albrighton Nature Reserve. Blakeway refers to the pond as being called Hall Pool as it was adjacent to Hall Orchard, which was a burial ground for Roman Catholics by the church of St Mary Magdalene. The High Street has not been altered too much over the years. The half timbered inns, Georgian facades and lime trees still make the street picturesque. Some sources say the lime trees were planted in the 19th century by a Dr Orson Bidwell, others say a former Earl of Shrewsbury was responsible. In all probability both of them planted trees and so may many other people if a tree was damaged or failed. The diary of John Howell, tenant farmer of Beamish and House Farm gives the year of planting as 1832. Albrighton fire station For most of the 14th century and into the 15th the manor of Albrighton, together with Ryton, was held by the Carles, Careles or Careless family.Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol II, (1855) London, pp. 157‚Äì159 The Carles were connected by marriage to the Lestranges (Lords Strange of Blackmere) and the Talbots. Albrighton left the control of this family with the marriage of an heiress to a member of the Corbet family in the reign of Henry VI. The Earl of Shrewsbury is the premier Earl of England and, until 1918, was the biggest land owner in Albrighton. They were originally the Talbot family (later Chetwynd-Talbot), many of whom are buried in Albrighton Church. George Talbot, 9th Earl of Shrewsbury was a Catholic priest and so never married. He died in 1630 aged sixty-three and was buried in the family tomb at the parish church of Albrighton. Early in the 17th century, Albrighton was noted for making buttons and then in the 18th century clock making flourished. By 1880 it was bricks, but by and large, agriculture was the main industry before the building of the railways. T A Rhodes the chemist in Albrighton Albrighton was granted Borough status in 1303 on account of its remoteness from Shrewsbury, Shropshire's county town. That was renewed in 1662 but it seemed to lapse again by the 19th century. A Mace confirming its borough status was discovered for auction at Sotheby's and this was purchased for ¬£359 in 1948. The money was raised by local subscription under the guidance and perseverance of the Rev E E Wright. The Borough status meant that there was a Justice of the Peace who could order the arrest of criminals. A small jail and stocks stood somewhere near to the Crown, whilst a room above it was used for various village meetings and transactions. There was also a Toll House nearby. A press article in 1884 discussing the history of the village's regular fairs stated that they were 'held on a wide open space called the Cross, where the cross roads are in the middle of the [village]. The Market Hall stood in the midst of the space, with the lock-up under it, and the stocks and pinfold close by. Rev. Blakeway's drafts of his History of Albrighton (c.1810-1814) mention that the Market House 'stands in the middle of the [village] and has two arches'. It is not known when the Toll Shop/House and Market Hall/House were demolished. The Rev Wright thought the buildings were more likely to be on the area of the village green but none of the early tithe maps show these buildings. Lloyds-TSB Bank in Albrighton The village green was much more important in the first half of 20th century. At the time of the First World War there were swings on it, political meetings were held there, an evangelist lady spent three days a year in a caravan giving out leaflets and talking to people, also a band gave concerts there. The population of Albrighton in 1800 was 900. In 1900 it was 1,200 and was still only 1,230 by 1931. Today it is over 4,000. Gas came to Albrighton in 1868 and the Gasometer was at the side of the railway goods yard. The Cosford Waterworks were established in 1857 and water was first supplied to the village in 1895. Electricity came in 1919 initially on overhead poles and later, during the 1950s, the cables were put underground. Austin Rose Garden Green Man In 1967, the A41 road through the village was bypassed and it now curves around the northern part of the village. In 1969, David C.H. Austin opened up the David Austin Plant Centre on the western edge of the village bordering the A464 road. David Austin Roses are renowned the world over for their roses and the site is open to the public providing a large tourist attraction in the village. In 1998, the village granted the Officers and Men of RAF Cosford the right to exercise through the village. Traditionally, this is known as having the Freedom of a village, town or city, but because Albrighton is not a borough, true freedom status could not be granted. However, every two years, staff from RAF Cosford parade down the High Street. Governance An electoral ward in the name of Albrighton exists. This ward includes the parish of Boningale and at the 2011 census had a total population of 4,628. Trivia Whilst writing the book The Old Curiosity Shop, Charles Dickens wrote about Tong Church whilst staying at the Public House now known as The Harp. In July 1992 Anneka Rice and the Challenge Anneka series came to Albrighton and created a fishing pool for disabled people, known as the Albrighton Moat Project. She returned in July 2017 to celebrate 25 years of the project. In the summer of 2006, a storm broke out in Albrighton and parts of the village were flooded badly.

Originally known as Ingstadkleiven Fort (also Ingstadkleiva Fort), it was built between 1908-1910 as a border fort as a defence against the perceived threat of a Swedish invasion. Background The intent behind Ingstadkleiva Fort was to block Swedish advances into Central Norway, as had happened repeatedly during the Swedish-Norwegian conflicts in the preceding centuries, for example the Hannibal War, Northern Wars, and Great Northern War.Brox 1988: 47 After the 1905 dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden, the Norwegian military harboured continued fears of a Swedish invasion to retake Norway. The fortress' trench line during construction As a successful attack into the centre of the country could split it in half, the Norwegian general staff in February 1906 suggested the construction of a blocking fort in the Stj√∏rdalen valley. Ingstadkleiva was early on pointed out as a good location to block an advance from the east. Already in March that year the Minister of Defence, commanding general, and chief of the Fortress Artillery surveyed the site and agreed to the plan. In a closed meeting on 26 April 1906, the Norwegian Parliament authorized the construction of Ingstadkleiva Fort, but no funds were allocated until 12 July 1907. In May 1908, the work began on the road up to the construction site and by January 1910 the fort was ready for use. Geography The fort was built on, and named after, Ingstadkleiva -- a high forested hill south of the Stj√∏rdalselva river, about from the village of Hegra. To the east, north, and north-west the terrain slopes down towards the Stj√∏rdalen valley and is dominated by the fort, while the south front is hilly and at a higher altitude than the Ingstadskleiva. Ingstadkleiva Fort has an excellent command of the Stj√∏rdalen valley to the north and east, but to the west the view is blocked by the Gr√∏thammeren and Hammeren hills, both about high. Ingstadkleiva Fort One of the fortress' 10.5 cm guns soon after installation The fort's guns came from the dismantled √òrje Fortress in Marker. The artillery was made up of flat angle guns with a range of . The fortifications themselves consisted of of halls and tunnels dynamited into the mountain at Ingstadkleiva, as well as trench systems and gun positions excavated from the rock with explosives. There are two main underground parallel tunnels of around length, with a tunnel connecting them at a straight angle. One of the main tunnels served as crew quarters while the other was in direct connection with the above ground artillery pits.Arnstad 1965, pp. 9-10 The fortress' artillery consisted of two and four positional artillery pieces in half-turrets placed in pits dynamited from the rock and lined with concrete, as well as four Krupp M/1887 field guns.Brox 1988, p. 48 The pieces, designed before the advent of recoil systems, were described by the Germans after the 1940 surrender as Napoleonic.Arnstad 1965, p. 9 The positional artillery is placed in an almost straight line facing east, with a distance between each gun and between each piece. To enable the fortress to withstand attack without support from outside a wide barbed wire obstacle was constructed encircling the entire fortress. =Early period= During the period 1910 to 1926 the fort was used as a major military base for the Tr√∏ndelag border areas with Sweden. In 1926, Ingstadkleiva Fort was put in reserve as part of the post-World War I defence budget cuts. A Red Cross holiday camp held at the deactivated fortress in 1939 =Deactivated period= From 1934-1939, the deactivated fort was used by the Norwegian Red Cross's youth branch as a summer holiday camp for children. In late 1939, Finnish soldiers of the independent Lapland Group who had crossed the Norwegian border into Finnmark escaping the fighting in the Petsamo district in northern Finland were interned at Ingstadkleiva Fort. All the Finns were repatriated during the early days of 1940. During the Finnish internees' stay a sauna was constructed at the fort's camp.Brox 1988: photo section, photo no. 4 =Norwegian Campaign= In 1940, from 15 April to 5 May, Hegra was attacked by the German invaders. During the first week the attacks consisted of two infantry assaults; however in the last two weeks attacks mostly featured heavy artillery fire and Luftwaffe bombing, as well as aggressive patrolling. During the siege large portions of the fort were covered in snow, and as all plans of the fort were stored in German-occupied Trondheim several sections of the fortifications were not discovered by the defenders before the 5 May surrender. Present-day fortress The fortress museum building (2014) Present-day (2014) buildings at the fortress camp, restaurant building to the left, guide building to the right After the end of the Second World War, Hegra Fortress was returned to Norwegian control and is today used as a museum with exhibitions detailing the fort's history with an emphasis on the 1940 siege. There is also a caf√© and a souvenir shop. The museum is often used for conferences and for seminars on issues of war and peace. Hegra Fortress is still owned by the Norwegian Defence Force and financed through the Norwegian Ministry of Defence. Hegra Rifle Club has since 13 May 1962 held an annual shooting competition at the fortress. Organized in commemoration of the 1940 battle and of the Second World War in general, the competition is held on the Sunday closest to 8 May (VE Day). The casing of a shell fired at the fortress in 1940 is awarded to the competition winner each year as a travelling trophy.

The merger led to the avoidance of U.S. taxes on its foreign market operations and a financial windfall for the CEO of Johnson Controls at that time, Alex Molinaroli.Stephen Gandell. \\"You Won't Believe How Much Johnson Controls' CEO Is Making on the Tyco Deal\\". Fortune 25 January 2016. , Johnson Control's tax inversion to Ireland is the 3rd largest U.S. tax inversion in history.  History  A Johnson Super-Sensitive Thermometer on an air conditioning unit In 1883, Warren S. Johnson, a professor at the Whitewater Normal School (now University of Wisconsin‚ÄìWhitewater) in Whitewater, Wisconsin, received a patent for the first electric room thermostat. His invention helped launch the building control industry and was the impetus for a new company. Johnson and a group of Milwaukee investors led by William Plankinton incorporated the Johnson Electric Service Company in 1885 to manufacture, install and service automatic temperature regulation systems for buildings. After Johnson's death in 1911, the company decided to focus on its temperature control business for nonresidential buildings. In 1970, the company took over clock manufacturer Standard Electric Time Company. The company was renamed Johnson Controls in 1974. In 1978, Johnson Controls acquired battery company Globe-Union. That same year, the company divested itself of the Standard Electric Time Company and sold it to Faraday. In 1985, Johnson Controls acquired automotive seating companies Hoover Universal and Ferro Manufacturing.Johnson Controls, Inc. History During the 2008‚Äì2009 recession, the company's president, Keith Wandell, lobbied Congress for a bailout of the companies that Johnson supplied. The Johnson Controls plant in Lakeshore, Ontario, closed in late March 2010 and the property was sold. In 2013, Stephen Roell retired and Alex Molinaroli took his position as CEO and chairman of the board. = Merger with Tyco = In January 2016, Johnson Controls merged with Tyco International to create a company headquartered in Cork, Ireland.http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/media-center/news/press- releases/2016/09/06/johnson-controls-and-tyco-complete-merger The new company is called Johnson Controls International plc. Hillary Clinton condemned the company for wanting to escape United States taxes through the merger after having \\"begged\\" the government for financial help in 2008. The Johnson deal, termed \\"outrageous\\" by Fortune magazine, qualifies as a \\"super inversion\\" because Tyco shareholders will own 44% of the company, thus avoiding penalties that the United States Department of the Treasury has imposed on other inversion deals. The firm estimated that it would save about US$150 million a year by avoiding American taxes. = Subsequent history = On October 31, 2016, the former Johnson Controls Automotive Experience division was spun off as a separate, publicly traded company, Adient, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In March 2017, it was announced that Scott Safety, its safety gear business, would be bought by 3M for $2 billion. On September 1, 2017, George Oliver was appointed as Chairman and CEO, an acceleration by 6 months from the original plans. http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/media- center/news/press-releases/2017/08/21/johnson-controls-announces-accelerated- leadership-succession  Women's work rights  In 1982, Johnson Controls enacted what it called a \\"fetal protection policy\\", which denied women the right to work on the battery production line because of the potential harm to a fetus they might conceive. Women were allowed to work on the production line only if they could prove that \\"... their inability to bear children had been medically documented.\\" In April 1984, the United Automobile Workers sued Johnson Controls on behalf of three employees. These employees were Mary Craig, who had chosen to be sterilized to avoid losing her job, Elsie Nason, a 50-year-old divorcee, who had suffered a loss of compensation when she was transferred from a high paying job that exposed her to lead, and Donald Penney, who had been denied a request for a leave of absence for the purpose of lowering his blood lead levels because he intended to become a father. The case was argued before the Supreme Court of the United States on October 10, 1990 and was decided on March 20, 1991. The Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. This was a landmark ruling because it affirmed that \\"... it is no more appropriate for the courts than it is for individual employers to decide whether a woman's reproductive role is more important to herself and her family than her economic role.\\"  Business units  The company's operations are segmented into two business units: Building Efficiency and Global WorkPlace Solutions. = Building Technologies & Solutions= The Building Technologies & Solutions business unit designs, produces, installs and services heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, industrial refrigeration, building management systems, fire and security systems and mechanical equipment for commercial and residential buildings.

Bush to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Senate Democrats, claiming Estrada was a conservative ideologue with no experience as a judge, and unable to block his nomination in the Senate Judiciary Committee after the Republican Party took control of the Senate in 2002, used a filibuster to prevent his nomination from being given a final confirmation vote by the full Senate. Background Estrada was born in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. After his parents divorced, he immigrated to the United States to join his mother when he was 17, arriving with a limited command of English. He graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a bachelor's degree from Columbia in 1983. He received a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree magna cum laude in 1986 from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review. Following law school, Estrada served as a law clerk, first for Judge Amalya Lyle Kearse of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and then for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy of the U.S. Supreme Court during Kennedy's first year on the Court in 1988. One of Estrada's fellow clerks that year was Peter Keisler, another conservative nominee to the D.C. Circuit whose nomination lapsed during the 110th Congress without a Senate vote cast on whether to confirm. From 1990 until 1992, Estrada served as Assistant U.S. Attorney and Deputy Chief of the Appellate Section, U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York. In 1992, he joined the United States Department of Justice as an Assistant to the Solicitor General for the George H. W. Bush Administration where he served with now Chief Justice John G. Roberts. In those capacities, Estrada represented the government in numerous jury trials and in many appeals before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Before joining the U.S. Attorney's Office, he practiced law in New York with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Estrada was married to Laury Gordon Estrada until her death at age 46 on November 28, 2004. She died of an accidental overdose of alcohol and sleeping pills, having also miscarried during the nomination fight. D.C. Circuit Court nomination George W. Bush nominated Estrada to a position on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on May 9, 2001. He received a unanimous \\"well- qualified\\" rating from the American Bar Association. Democratic Senators opposed the nomination, noting Estrada's lack of any prior judicial experience at the local, state, or federal level. Additionally, though a member of The Federalist Society, Estrada had never been an academic, so there was no record of his writing by which the Senate could review his record. He had worked in the Office of the Solicitor General under President George Herbert Walker Bush. He had also been a partner in the same law firm as Ted Olson, working on the legal team that represented George W. Bush in the Bush v. Gore case. He and his record were well known in conservative circles. He was known to be a friend of Ann Coulter who acknowledged him in her book.CNN Crossfire , 31 January 2003. In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Estrada said he had never thought about Roe v. Wade, even while serving as a Supreme Court clerk at a time when the first Bush Administration had asked the Court to reconsider it.Edward Lazarus, \\"How the Miguel Estrada Nomination Illustrates Our Out-of-Control Confirmation Process, And What We Can Do to Improve the System,\\" FindLaw , 20 February 2003. Also, while as Justice Kennedy's clerk, an article written by Jack Newfield appearing in The Nation magazine alleged that Estrada had disqualified candidates for clerkship who were too liberal while interviewing them. When questioned about this by Senator Charles Schumer during his confirmation hearing, Estrada did not recall the incident.Byron York, \\"Democrats Ambush Estrada,\\" National Review Online. , 27 September 2002. Democratic Senators also objected to the refusal by the Office of the Solicitor General to release samples of Estrada's writings while employed there, although such a release of confidential documents would have been precedent-setting. Minority Leader Tom Daschle was quoted by the Associated Press as saying, \\"The stumbling block to Miguel Estrada's nomination all along was the administration's refusal to allow him to complete his job application and provide the Senate with the basic information it needed to evaluate and vote on his nomination.\\"Jesse J. Holland, \\"Democrats force nominee for court seat to withdraw,\\" , 5 September 2003. A bipartisan group of former Solicitors General, however, wrote a letter objecting to the Democrats' demand for memos that Estrada had written while he was with the office. The letter argued release of prior memos by government employees to the public would endanger the Solicitor General Office's ability to provide confidential legal advice to the Executive Branch. Leaked internal memos to Democratic Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin mention liberal interest groups' desire to keep Estrada off the court partially because \\"he is Latino,\\" and because of his potential to be a future Supreme Court nominee. A spokesman for Durbin said that \\"no one intended racist remarks against Estrada\\" and that the memo only meant to highlight that Estrada was \\"politically dangerous\\" because Democrats knew he would be an \\"attractive candidate\\" that would be difficult to contest since he didn't have any record. Democrats argued that Estrada had extreme right-wing views, although others pointed to Estrada's difference with some conservatives on Commerce Clause issues.Wittes, Benjamin. Confirmation Wars: Preserving Independent Courts in Angry Times, page 8. On March 6, 2003, there was the first of seven failed cloture votes on Estrada.Senate roll call votes of 2003 Fifty-five senators voted to end debate on his nomination and allow a final confirmation vote, and forty-four senators voted not to end debate. After twenty-eight months in political limbo and a protracted six-month battle using the filibuster, Estrada withdrew his name from further consideration on September 4, 2003. Bush nominated Thomas B. Griffith in his place, who was confirmed in 2005 under the terms of the Gang of 14 Deal. With the benefit of hindsight, Jan Crawford has said of the nomination that \\"[i]f Majority Leader Bill Frist had shown real leadership, he would never have allowed a Democratic minority to achieve the first-ever filibusters of appeals court nominees. If Trent Lott had been majority leader, Estrada would have been confirmed.\\"Greenberg, Jan Crawford. \\"The Fight Over Miguel Estrada Continues\\", Legalities, ABC News (2009-07-13). Numerous judicial nominees prior to Estrada had been kept off the courts, when the Senate refused to let the nomination out of committee for a floor vote. A filibuster had been used in 1968 to extend debate regarding the elevation of Associate Justice Abe Fortas to Chief Justice of the United States, but the Estrada filibuster was different in multiple ways. Estrada's was the first filibuster ever to be successfully used against a judicial nominee who had clear support of the majority in the Senate.Curry, Tom. \\"Filibuster foes argue over '68 Fortas precedent; Historians say delaying tactics killed chief justice nomination; differences abound between then and now\\", NBC News (2005-05-19). Estrada's was the first filibuster of any court of appeals nominee. It was also the first filibuster that prevented a judicial nominee from joining a court. Current life Estrada is a partner at the Washington, D.C., law office of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, where he is a member of the firm's Appellate and Constitutional Law Practice Group as well as the Business Crimes and Investigations Practice Group. Estrada joined Rudy Giuliani's 2008 presidential campaign as a judicial adviser. In May 2010, Estrada wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of President Barack Obama's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, Elena Kagan, as Estrada and Kagan have remained friends since meeting as students at Harvard Law School. In his letter, Estrada strongly commended Kagan for appointment to the court as \\"an impeccably qualified nominee\\" possessed of a \\"formidable intellect\\" and an \\"exemplary temperament.\\" While openly recognizing that her views on judicial role and Constitutional interpretation are \\"as firmly center-left as my own are center-right,\\" Estrada went on to insist that \\"one of the prerogatives of the President under our Constitution is to nominate high federal officers, including judges, who share his (or her) governing philosophies.\\"Estrada, Miguel. \\"Letter in Support of Kagan Nomination\\" via Washington Post (2010-05-14) In 1999, Kagan had been nominated by President Clinton to serve on the D.C. Circuit‚Äîthe same court Estrada was later nominated to. At that time, Kagan was kept off the circuit court because Republicans‚Äîthe majority party in the Senate‚Äîrefused to give her a hearing or a vote, though she was not subjected to the filibuster later used by Democrats to block Estrada's nomination. Likewise, at her confirmation hearing on June 29, 2010, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, when asked by Senator Lindsey Graham whether she believed that Estrada was qualified to serve on an appellate court, Kagan responded affirmatively and added that she believed Estrada was qualified to serve on the Supreme Court as well. Kagan then told Senator Graham that she would welcome the opportunity to put this belief in writing after her hearing. When questioned by Senator Coburn the following day, she reaffirmed her position, saying that she \\"...would have voted for him\\". In July 2010, in follow-up to her promise to Senator Graham, Kagan wrote a letter expressing her belief in Estrada's \\"superlative\\" qualifications for appointment to \\"any federal court,\\" whether to the federal appellate or to the U.S. Supreme Court. In her letter, Kagan commended Estrada as \\"a towering intellect\\" with \\"a prodigious capacity for hard work,\\" also remarking that \\"no one I know is a more faithful friend or a more fundamentally decent person\\".

(His namesake uncle was usually known as \\"Dr. Channing\\", while the nephew was commonly called \\"Ellery Channing\\", in print.) The younger Ellery Channing was thought brilliant but undisciplined by many of his contemporaries. Amos Bronson Alcott famously said of him in 1871, \\"Whim, thy name is Channing.\\" Nevertheless, the Transcendentalists thought his poetry among the best of their group's literary products. Life and work Channing was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Dr. Walter Channing, a physician and Harvard Medical School professor. He attended Boston Latin School and later the Round Hill School in Northampton, Massachusetts, then entered Harvard University in 1834, but did not graduate. In 1839 he lived for some months in Woodstock, Illinois in a log hut that he built; in 1840 he moved to Cincinnati. In the fall of 1842 he married Ellen Fuller, the younger sister of transcendentalist Margaret Fuller and they began their married life in Concord, Massachusetts where they lived a half-mile north of The Old Manse as Nathaniel Hawthorne's neighbor. Channing wrote to Thoreau in a letter: \\"I see nothing for you on this earth but that field which I once christened 'Briars'; go out upon that, build yourself a hut, and there begin the grand process of devouring yourself alive. I see no alternative, no other hope for you.\\" Thoreau adopted this advice, and shortly after built his famous dwelling beside Walden Pond. Some speculation identifies Channing as the \\"Poet\\" of Thoreau's Walden; the two were frequent walking companions. In 1843 he moved to a hill-top in Concord, some distance from the village, and published his first volume of poems, reprinting several from The Dial. Thoreau called his literary style \\"sublimo-slipshod\\". The printing of a compilation of these poems was subsidized by Samuel Gray Ward. In 1844‚Äì1845, Channing separated from his family and restarted his wandering, unanchored life. He first spent some months in New York City as a writer for the Tribune, after which he made a journey to Europe for several months. In 1846 he returned to Concord and lived alone on the main street, opposite the house occupied by the Thoreau family and then by Alcott. During much of this time he had no fixed occupation, though for a while, in 1855‚Äì1856, he was one of the editors of the New Bedford Mercury. After enumerating his various wanderings, places of residence, and rare intervals of employment, his housemate Franklin Benjamin Sanborn wrote of him: In 1873, Channing was the first biographer of Thoreau, publishing Thoreau, the Poet-Naturalist. When visiting the Emersons in 1876, the young poet Emma Lazarus met Channing and accompanied him on a tour of some of the places Thoreau had loved, stating in her journal in regard to the friendship between Thoreau and Channing that Channing gave Henry Thoreau's compass to Emma Lazarus. =Death= Channing's grave Channing died 23 December 1901 in Concord, at the home of Franklin Benjamin Sanborn, where he had spent the final ten years of his life. He is buried at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Concord on Authors' Ridge directly facing his longtime friend Thoreau. Frank Sanborn paid for Channing's burial plot. In a 19 July 1902, Springfield Republican article, Frank Sanborn states, In a later Republican column, Sanborn informs: Criticism Critic Edgar Allan Poe was particularly harsh in reviewing Channing's poetry in a series of articles titled \\"Our Amateur Poets\\" published in Graham's Magazine in 1843. He wrote, \\"It may be said in his favor that nobody ever heard of him. Like an honest woman, he has always succeeded in keeping himself from being made the subject of gossip\\".In this article, Poe mistakes W. Ellery Channing to be the son of, rather than nephew of William E. Channing and voices his views as \\"we\\" (the Society in Baltimore) rather than \\"I\\". A critic for the Daily Forum in Philadelphia agreed with Poe, though he was surprised Poe bothered reviewing Channing at all. He wrote: > Mr. Poe, the most hyper-critical writer of this meridian, cuts the poetry of > William Ellery Channing Junior, if not into inches, at least into feet. Mr. > C's poetry is very trashy, and we should as soon expect to hear Bryant > writing sonnets on a lollypop as to see Mr. Poe gravely attempt to criticize > the volume. Nathaniel Hawthorne metaphorically appraised Channing's oeuvre as of particularly high quality, if uneven, in the short story \\"Earth's Holocaust\\".

He is best known for his ongoing comic book series Optic Nerve and his illustrations in The New Yorker.  Early life  Adrian Tomine was born May 31, 1974, in Sacramento, California. His parents divorced when he was two years old. His father is Dr. Chris Tomine, Ph.D. and Professor Emeritus Environmental Engineering at California State University Sacramento's Department of Civil Engineering. His mother is Dr. Satsuki Ina, Ph.D. and Professor Emeritus at California State University Sacramento's School of Education. Tomine is fourth-generation Japanese American, and both of his parents spent part of their childhoods in Japanese American internment camps in the U.S. during World War II. He also has a brother, Dylan, who is eight years his senior. After his parents divorced, Tomine moved frequently, accompanying his mother to Fresno, Oregon, Germany, and Belgium, while spending summers with his father in Sacramento. He started writing, drawing and self-publishing his comic Optic Nerve, which he has continued producing as a regular comic book series for Drawn & Quarterly. As a young child, Tomine enjoyed Spider-Man and Indiana Jones comics. In an interview, Tomine said that \\"something about the medium just transfixed me at an early age\\" and that his influences include Jaime Hernandez and Daniel Clowes. He is also a fan of contemporary Chris Ware. In addition to writing graphic novels such as Summer Blonde and Shortcomings, Tomine regularly works in commercial illustration. He has done several covers and illustrations for The New Yorker; his first was \\"Missed Connection\\". Career Tomine began publishing his work when he was still a teenager; he was mainly self-published, but was also published in mainstream publications like Pulse! while still in high school. In an interview published in The Comics Journal #205, Tomine addressed criticisms of his work and discussed his influences in detail, admitting he was strongly influenced by Dan Clowes and Jaime Hernandez. The cover of his Journal issue featured a self-parody of sorts, featuring a sequence in which a hipster girl says to the reader, \\"I'm so cute! I love coffee, and indie rock! But... I'm sad. Can you relate?\\" Optic Nerve is Tomine's ongoing comic series that was originally self-published in minicomic form and distributed to local comics shops in his area. Tomine published seven issues of the Optic Nerve mini; most of the stories from there were later compiled into a single edition, 32 Stories: The Complete Optic Nerve Mini-Comics, published by Drawn and Quarterly. After Drawn and Quarterly became Tomine's publisher, Optic Nerve was published at standard comic book size, and the issue numbering was restarted, making the first Drawn & Quarterly published issue to be numbered #1. These comics range from a few pages per story to the 32-page standard in later issues. Issues #1‚Äì4 included several stories each and were collected in Sleepwalk and Other Stories, and issues #5‚Äì8 included one story each and were collected in Summer Blonde. Issues #9‚Äì11 were compiled into a graphic novel, Shortcomings, released in September 2007. In Shortcomings, Tomine explored racial issues directly. In 2015, Tomine's graphic novel Killing and Dying, a collection of six short graphic stories, was released. Tomine has contributed his art to several albums, including liner notes and album art for Eels' Electro-Shock Blues, \\"Last Stop: This Town\\", \\"Cancer for the Cure\\", and End Times, also Yo La Tengo's album artwork that consisted solely of covers called Yo La Tengo Is Murdering the Classics and Murder in the Second Degree The Softies' album \\"It's Love\\", and The Crabs's \\"What Were Flames Now Smolder\\".

Also, the term combinatorial geometry, sometimes abbreviated to geometry, was intended to replace \\"simple matroid\\". These terms are now infrequently used in the study of matroids. In the branch of mathematical logic called model theory, infinite finitary matroids, there called \\"pregeometries\\" (and \\"geometries\\" if they are simple matroids), are used in the discussion of independence phenomena. It turns out that many fundamental concepts of linear algebra ‚Äì closure, independence, subspace, basis, dimension ‚Äì are preserved in the framework of abstract geometries. The study of how pregeometries, geometries, and abstract closure operators influence the structure of first-order models is called geometric stability theory.  Definitions  = Pregeometries and geometries = A combinatorial pregeometry (also known as a finitary matroid), is a second-order structure: (X,\\\\text{cl}), where \\\\text{cl}:\\\\mathcal{P}(X)\\\\to\\\\mathcal{P}(X) (called the closure map) satisfies the following axioms. For all a, b\\\\in X and A, B,C\\\\subseteq X: # \\\\text{cl}:(\\\\mathcal{P}(X),\\\\subseteq)\\\\to(\\\\mathcal{P}(X),\\\\subseteq) is a homomorphism in the category of partial orders (monotone increasing), and dominates \\\\text{id} (I.e. A\\\\subseteq B implies A\\\\subseteq\\\\text{cl}(A)\\\\subseteq\\\\text{cl}(B).) and is idempotent. # Finite character: For each a\\\\in\\\\text{cl}(A) there is some finite F\\\\subseteq A with a\\\\in\\\\text{cl}(F). # Exchange principle: If b\\\\in\\\\text{cl}(C\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{a\\\\\\\\})\\\\smallsetminus\\\\text{cl}(C), then a\\\\in\\\\text{cl}(C\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{b\\\\\\\\}) (and hence by monotonicity and idempotence in fact a\\\\in\\\\text{cl}(C\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{b\\\\\\\\})\\\\smallsetminus\\\\text{cl}(C)). A geometry is a pregeometry in which the closure of singletons are singletons and the closure of the empty set is the empty set. = Independence, bases and dimension = Given sets A,B\\\\subset S, A is independent over B if a otin \\\\text{cl}((A\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{a\\\\\\\\})\\\\cup B) for any a\\\\in A. A set A_0 \\\\subset A is a basis for A over B if it is independent over B and A\\\\subset \\\\text{cl}(A_0\\\\cup B). Since a pregeometry satisfies the Steinitz exchange property all bases are of the same cardinality, hence the definition of the dimension of A over B as \\\\text{dim}_B A = A_0 has no ambiguity. The sets A,B are independent over C if \\\\text{dim}_{B\\\\cup C} = \\\\dim_C A' whenever A' is a finite subset of A. Note that this relation is symmetric. In minimal sets over stable theories the independence relation coincides with the notion of forking independence. = Geometry automorphism = A geometry automorphism of a geometry S is a bijection \\\\sigma:2^S\\\\to 2^S such that \\\\sigma\\\\text{cl}(X)=\\\\text{cl}(\\\\sigma X) for any X\\\\subset S. A pregeometry S is said to be homogeneous if for any closed X\\\\subset S and any two elements a,b\\\\in S\\\\setminus X there is an automorphism of S which maps a to b and fixes X pointwise. = The associated geometry and localizations = Given a pregeometry (S,\\\\text{cl}) its associated geometry (sometimes referred in the literature as the canonical geometry) is the geometry (S',\\\\text{cl}') where #S'=\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{cl}(a)\\\\mid a\\\\in S\\\\setminus \\\\text{cl} (\\\\emptyset)\\\\\\\\}, and #For any X\\\\subset S, \\\\text{cl}'(\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{cl}(a)\\\\mid a\\\\in X\\\\\\\\}) = \\\\\\\\{\\\\text{cl}(b)\\\\mid b\\\\in\\\\text{cl}(X)\\\\\\\\} Its easy to see that the associated geometry of a homogeneous pregeometry is homogeneous. Given A\\\\subset S the localization of S is the geometry (S,\\\\text{cl}_A) where \\\\text{cl}_A(X)=\\\\text{cl}(X\\\\cup A). = Types of pregeometries = Let (S,\\\\text{cl}) be a pregeometry, then it is said to be: * trivial (or degenerate) if \\\\text{cl}(X)=\\\\bigcup\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{cl}(a)\\\\mid a\\\\in X\\\\\\\\}. * modular if any two closed finite dimensional sets X,Y\\\\subset S satisfy the equation \\\\text{dim}(X\\\\cup Y) = \\\\text{dim}(X) + \\\\text{dim}(Y) - \\\\text{dim}(X\\\\cap Y) (or equivalently that X is independent of Y over X\\\\cap Y). * locally modular if it has a localization at a singleton which is modular. * (locally) projective if it is non-trivial and (locally) modular. * locally finite if closures of finite sets are finite. Triviality, modularity and local modularity pass to the associated geometry and are preserved under localization. If S is a locally modular homogeneous pregeometry and a\\\\in S\\\\setminus\\\\text{cl}\\\\emptyset then the localization of S in b is modular. The geometry S is modular if and only if whenever a,b\\\\in S, A\\\\subset S, \\\\text{dim}\\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\\\\\}=2 and \\\\text{dim}_A\\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\\\\\} \\\\le 1 then (\\\\text{cl}\\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\\\\\}\\\\cap\\\\text{cl}(A))\\\\setminus\\\\text{cl}\\\\emptyset e\\\\emptyset.  Examples  = The trivial example = If S is any set we may define \\\\text{cl}(A)=A. This pregeometry is a trivial, homogeneous, locally finite geometry. = Vector spaces and projective spaces = Let F be a field (a division ring actually suffices) and let V be a \\\\kappa-dimensional vector space over F. Then V is a pregeometry where closures of sets are defined to be their span. This pregeometry is homogeneous and modular. Vector spaces are considered to be the prototypical example of modularity. V is locally finite if and only if F is finite. V is not a geometry, as the closure of any nontrivial vector is a subspace of size at least 2. The associated geometry of a \\\\kappa-dimensional vector space over F is the (\\\\kappa-1)-dimensional projective space over F. It is easy to see that this pregeometry is a projective geometry. = Affine spaces = Let V be a \\\\kappa-dimensional affine space over a field F. Given a set define its closure to be its affine hull (i.e. the smallest affine subspace containing it). This forms a homogeneous (\\\\kappa+1)-dimensional geometry. An affine space is not modular (for example, if X and Y be parallel lines then the formula in the definition of modularity fails). However, it is easy to check that all localizations are modular. = Algebraically closed fields = Let k be an algebraically closed field with \\\\text{tr.deg}(k)\\\\ge\\\\omega, and define the closure of a set to be its algebraic closure. While vector spaces are modular and affine spaces are \\"almost\\" modular (i.e. everywhere locally modular), algebraically closed fields are examples of the other extremity, not being even locally modular (i.e. none of the localizations is modular).

Note the triangular blade with flat face forward making it suitable only for stabbing and not slashing. A trench knife is a combat knife designed to kill or incapacitate an enemy at close quarters, such as in a trench or other confined area.Peterson, Harold L., Daggers and Fighting Knives of the Western World, Courier Dover Publications, , (2001), p. 80: \\"Right at the outset trench knives were introduced by both sides during World War I, so that the common soldier was once again equipped with a knife designed primarily for combat.\\"Alger, John I., Definitions and Doctrine of the Military Art: Past and Present, Avery Publications Group, , (1985), p. 102Catalog of Standard Ordnance Items, Washington, D.C: U.S. Army Ordnance Publications (1943) It was developed as a close combat weapon for soldiers attacking enemy trenches during the First World War. An example of a World War I trench knife is the German Army's Nahkampfmesser (close combat knife).Bull, Stephen, Encyclopedia of Military Technology and Innovation, Greenwood Publishing, (2004), p. 70: During World War I, many German trench or close-combat knives (Nahkampfmesser) were issued by the military, while privately purchased knives were often made to military patterns. Most featured blades of around 150 mm (6 inches), with slab wooden grips and metal scabbards.Military Collectables: An International Directory of Twentieth-Century Militaria, Crescent Books, , (1984), p. 37 During the Second World War, the trench knife, by this time also called a combat knife, was developed into new designs. On the German side, the Nahkampfmesser and associated knives were widely issued to the ordinary soldier for combat and utility purposes, while Allied armies mostly issued trench knives to elite infantry units and soldiers not equipped with the bayonet. Early trench knives With the exception of the German Nahkampfmesser or (close combat knife), most early trench knives were fabricated by hand by individual soldiers or blacksmiths for the purpose of silently killing sentries and other soldiers during trench raids.Duan, James T., Dear old \\"K\\", Boston, MA: James T. Duane (1922), p. 76 These early \\"trench knives\\" were often shortened and sharpened Army-issue bayonets. One type of stabbing weapon, the French Nail, was made by cutting and pointing the steel stakes used to support the barbed wire protecting trenches. Some historians say that some trench knives models were inspired by the Bowie knife.Shotgun, www.civilwarhome.com (2002) Soon afterwards, these fabricated trench knives were used in defensive close-quarters trench warfare, and such fighting soon revealed limitations in existing designs. A more elegant form of the French Nail was the Poignard-Ba√Øonnette Lebel M1886/14. Approved as a standard military infantry weapon after its development by Lieutenant Colonel CoutrotRoquier, Roger, and Lecoeur, G√©rard, Les couteaux de nos soldats, Paris: Editions Cr√©pin-Leblond, (2001): In 1915, Lt. Col. Coutrot, an artillery officer, was serving as the officer-in-charge of the military acceptance board for machine guns made by MAC (Manufacture d'armes de Ch√¢tellerault) located in the French commune of Ch√¢tellerault, which was also the centre of the French cutlery industry. of the French Army, the Poignard- Ba√Øonnette Lebel consisted of a long, needle-pointed, stiletto-profile blade with wooden handle and an integrated knuckle guard made of steel. Originally a conversion of the French √âp√©e-Ba√Øonnette Mod√®le 1886 (bayonet), and designed strictly as an offensive weapon, the Poignard-Ba√Øonnette Lebel used a section of the M1886 Lebel' long, narrow stiletto-type cruciform blade, designed to quickly kill an enemy soldier with a deep thrust. Up to three trench knives could be constructed from a single M1886 Lebel bayonet. Because French industry was working under wartime conditions with numerous material shortages, often using subcontracted labor, even officially sanctioned French Army trench knives tend to vary significantly from knife to knife. The need for knives was so great that already-understrength French Army formations were forced to demobilize hundreds of former cutlery workers so that they could return to their former jobs and begin quantity production of trench knives for the armed forces. As the war went on, newer and more versatile blade-type trench knife patterns such as the double-edged dagger Couteau Poignard Mle 1916 dit Le Vengeur began to replace the French Nail and earlier stiletto- style trench knives. The French lead in trench knife development was closely followed by the United States, which introduced three successive trench knife models - the M1917, M1918, and Mark I (1918) - all based directly or indirectly upon previous French designs. =German Army trench knives= The German Nahkampfmesser (translated: close combat knife) was the standard issue German combat knife during the First World War. It remained in service in modified form through the end of the Second World War.Sainz, Agustin, Deutsche Soldaten, Casemate Publishers, , (2008), p. 152 Most of these knives had slab wooden grips and metal sheaths and were sturdily made. According to one authoritative source, German-issued trench knives of World War I were \\"conventional, general-purpose, cut-and-thrust knives\\" with blades that were \\"for the most part approximately six inches in length, single-edged with a top leading false edge ... although double-edged blades are occasionally encountered.\\" Johnson, Thomas M., LTC (Ret.) & Wittmann, Thomas T.: Collecting the Edged Weapons of Imperial Germany, Vol. I, Privately published, (1988), p. 317 After the French Nail was employed against them, German forces on the Western Front also began to employ converted steel barbed-wire stakes as stabbing weapons for use by their own soldiers. German trench knives carried during World War II were similar in design and are usually known today as boot knives, although they seldom were carried in boots. Most also had steel sheaths with clips that could be attached to boots, webbing or clothing, and most were made by government contractors and issued as combat gear. =British and Commonwealth trench knives= The British Army and its Commonwealth allies (e.g. Australia, Canada and New Zealand) used a wide variety of trench knives during World War I. Some were commercial models based on Bowie knives. Others were more specialised types, such as push daggers with a roughly cylindrical aluminium grip which was shaped to fit comfortably when the user's hand made a fist. The attached blade protruded between the knuckles of the user. It was common British practice for trench knives to be used in combination with other \\"quiet\\" weapons, like trench clubs, pickaxe handles and hatchets, during trench raiding expeditions, backed up with revolvers and hand grenades. Many standardized versions were made by government contractors and officially issued. Most had slab wooden grips and metal sheaths and were sturdily made. During the Second World War, the Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife was widely issued to forces such as the British Commandos, Royal Marines Commandos, Parachute Regiment, Special Boat Service and the Special Air Service. Though not a true \\"trench knife\\" per se, the Fairbairn-Sykes was used for similar purposes.Johnson, Thomas M., LTC (Ret.) & Wittmann, Thomas T.: Collecting the Edged Weapons of Imperial Germany, Vol. I, Privately published, 1988, p. 317. =US trench knives= The first official U.S. trench knife adopted for service issue was the U.S. M1917 trench knife designed by Henry Disston & Sons, and based on examples of trench knives then in service with the French Army. The M1917 featured a triangular stiletto blade, wooden grip, metal knuckle guard, and a rounded pommel. The M1917 proved unsatisfactory in service, and a slightly improved version, the M1918, was adopted within months. Despite this, the M1918 is almost identical to the M1917, differing primarily in the construction and appearance of the knuckle guard. Usable only as stabbing weapons, the M1917 and M1918 frequently suffered broken blades. Their limited utility and general unpopularity caused the AEF to empanel a testing board in 1918 to test various trench knives and select a replacement. Mark I brass knuckles Trench Knife This design was followed by the Mark I, which was designed by a board of U.S. Army officers to remedy certain deficiencies of the M1917/18.Crowell, Benedict (1919), America's Munitions 1917-1918, Report of Benedict Crowell, Assistant Secretary of War (Director of Munitions) U.S. War Department, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, pp. 88, 228 Adopted in late 1918, with a blade profile patterned after the French Couteau Poignard Mle 1916 dit Le Vengeur, most Mark I knives were completed too late to see service in the trenches of World War I. During World War II, the Mark I was issued in 1942 and 1943 to airborne troops, Army Rangers, and Marine Raiders.KNIFE - U.S. KNIFE MODEL 1918 MKI TRENCH, Springfield Armory Museum - Collection RecordCanfield, Bruce N., U.S. INFANTRY WEAPONS OF WORLD WAR II, Lincoln, RI: Andrew Mowbray Publishers, , (1994)Shackleford, Steve, ed. (2009), Blade's Guide To Knives And Their Values, Krause Publications, , p. 387 The Mark I featured a full-tang design with a double-edged blade and a heavy bronze hilt incorporating a guard ostensibly shaped as a knuckle duster, though the latter was intended to protect the fingers and prevent the knife from being knocked from the hand while in combat rather than for use as a weapon. Reflecting the savagery of hand-to-hand trench warfare, the Mark I's pommel incorporated a so-called 'skull-crusher' cap extension, ostensibly designed to stun or kill an enemy soldier and to provide a secondary weapon in circumstances where the blade was damaged or broken. A special proprietary metal scabbard was issued with the Mark I, capable of accommodating the new knife and its oversized knuckleduster grip handle. In 1918, Captain Rupert Hughes of the U.S. Army submitted a patent application for a specialized automatic-opening trench knife of his own design, the Hughes Trench Knife.Hughes, Rupert, Letters Patent No. 1,315,503 issued September 9, 1919, Washington, D.C.: United States Patent Office This was a curious device consisting of a folding spring-loaded knife blade attached to a handle which fastened to the back of the hand and was secured by a leather strap, leaving the palm and fingers free for grasping other objects. Pressing a button on the handle automatically extended the blade into an open and locked position, allowing the knife to be used as a stabbing weapon. The Hughes Trench Knife was evaluated as a potential military arm by a panel of U.S. Army officers from the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in June 1918. After testing the board found the Hughes design to be of no value, and it was never adopted.Military affairs: journal of the American Military Institute, American Military History Foundation, American Military Institute, Kansas State University, Dept. of History (1937) Vol. I, p. 153 Hughes went on to patent his automatic trench knife in 1919, though it appears to have never interested any civilian manufacturers. M7 Bayonet and M8A1 Sheath used with the M16 rifle The U.S. Army adopted the M3 Trench Knife as a replacement for the Mark I in 1943.Whitman, L., New Army Trench Knife, Army & Navy Journal, Vol. 80, 6 February 1943, p. 649 The Mark I required strategic metals to produce and was too costly to place into mass production, and had been criticized as being unsuited to more modern styles of hand-to-hand knife fighting.Blending Metals to Arm Our Fighting Men, Popular Science, Vol. 142 No. 6 (June 1943), p. 104Somers, R.H. (Brig. Gen., U.S. Army, ret.) (ed.), Ordnance, American Ordnance Association, Volume 24, No. 138 (May‚ÄìJune 1943), pp. 553-554Cassidy, William L., The Complete Book Of Knife Fighting, , (1997), pp. 47-48 As the U.S. Catalog of Standard Ordnance Items of 1943 explained: \\"The Trench Knife M3 has been developed to fill the need in modern warfare for hand-to-hand fighting. While designated for issue to soldiers not armed with the bayonet, it was especially designed for such shock units as parachute troops and rangers.\\" The M3 was first issued to U.S. Army soldiers in 1943, with the first knives going to elite units such as airborne troops and the U.S. Army Rangers. Despite being designed for hand-to-hand warfare, the M3 did not receive universal praise as a fighting knife upon issue to combat units. While well-balanced (some paratroopers and rangers mastered the art of using the M3 as a throwing knife), the M3's blade was criticized as being too narrow for rough usage, particularly for utility tasks such as opening ammo crates and food tins, while its edge was found to be somewhat difficult to sharpen. The blade's secondary edge was also criticized as being too short, limiting the knife's utility when used for backhand slashing strokes. Many features of the M3 were incorporated into the M4 bayonet for the M1 Carbine, the M5 bayonet for the M1 Garand, the M6 Bayonet for the M14 rifle, and finally the M7 bayonet for the M16 rifle. The M3 knife and all of these bayonets fit in the M8A1 scabbard, officially designated as the \\"Scabbard, Bayonet Knife, M8A1,\\" with the National Stock Number (NSN) 1095-00-508-0339. Other fighting knives used by U.S. forces have sometimes been referred to as trench knives. These include the stiletto-shaped daggers carried by Marine Corps Raiders in World War II, and fighting-utility knives made by KA-BAR and other manufacturers.

Fitch Parkway, runs from Farm to Market Road 2154 (FM 2154) to SH 6 in College Station, Texas. The current SH 40 was authorized in 1994. Signage for the highway went up March 2006 and the road was officially opened June 23, 2006. SH 40 occupies the overpass and intersection with SH 6 that was formerly Greens Prairie Road, which was truncated and connected to SH 40 by Arrington Road West of SH 6. Greens Prairie Road and SH 40 were renamed in honor of William D. Fitch in August 2006.http://www.cstx.gov/docs/fitch_invitation.pdf At SH 6, SH 40 terminates and becomes a local road (maintaining the Fitch Parkway name) continuing northeast to SH 30. Route description SH 40 begins at an intersection with FM 2154 (Wellborn Road) in College Station, Brazos County, heading southeast on William D. Fitch Parkway, a four-lane undivided road. The road heads near residential subdivisions, becoming a divided highway with the median widening to include woodland. The highway heads through more wooded areas with some fields and residential neighborhoods, turning to the east. SH 40 turns to the northeast and the median narrows, with the road becoming undivided again as it comes to its eastern terminus at an interchange with SH 6. History Historic SH 40 A previous highway, also called SH 40, existed from March 17, 1919 until September 26, 1939, and ran from the Texas-Oklahoma boundary north of Gainesville down through Denton, Dallas and Beaumont before ending in Sabine Pass. On March 18, 1919, a spur route, SH 40A that went from Denton and ended in Fort Worth was designated, so SH 40A and the route of SH 40 north of Dallas replaced SH 16. On August 21, 1923, this spur had become an extension of SH 10. That same day, SH 40 was truncated to Voth (north of Beaumont), with the section from Voth to Beaumont already part of SH 8 and the section from Beaumont to Sabine Pass cancelled. SH 40 was rerouted over a portion of SH 37 between Rusk and southeast of Lufkin, while the old route was either cancelled or transferred to SH 37. On May 22, 1933, SH 40 Spur was created to Baxter. On January 24, 1938, SH 40 Loop was designated to Keltys. On April 19, 1938, SH 40 Bypass was designated from SH 40 to SH 114. On June 21, 1938, SH 40 Spur was designated to Forest. The Gainesville to Dallas portion became US 77 in 1929. In 1932, the Dallas to Jacksonville stretch had become part of US 175. The last remaining portion of old SH 40, Jacksonville to Port Arthur, became part of US 69 in 1934. On September 26, 1939, SH 40 was cancelled in favor of these US Highways. The SH 40 Loop and SH 40 Spur routes were renumbered as Loop 12 (Dallas), Spur 29 (Forest), Loop 36 (Keltys), and Spur 65 (Baxter). SH 40A was a spur route proposed on September 16, 1926 going from St. Augustine south to Zavalla. This route was actually designated as SH 8B instead(now SH 147). Interstates 35E and 35W roughly follow the old SH 40 routes from Dallas and Fort Worth, respectively, to Denton, and the old route from Denton north is approximated by Interstate 35.

The Bridgnorth Cliff Railway, also known as the Bridgnorth Funicular Railway or Castle Hill Railway, is a funicular railway in the town of Bridgnorth in the English county of Shropshire. The line links the Low Town of Bridgnorth, adjacent to the River Severn, with the High Town, adjacent to the ruins of Bridgnorth Castle. The line is one of four funicular railways in the UK built to the same basic design (the others were the Clifton Rocks Railway in Bristol; the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway in Devon; and the Constitution Hill Railway in Aberystwyth, Wales). It is one of the steepest railways in the country, and at least one source (the information panel outside the top station) claims it is both the steepest and shortest. However, the East Hill Lift Railway, Hastings is graded at a steeper 78%. In 2020 the Bridgnorth Cliff Railway found itself mired in controversy, after denying access to anyone not wearing a face covering, despite government guidance permitting a number of exemptions on medical grounds. This resulted in considerable negative publicity, with the point raised that the attraction was denying access to people with disabilities or medical conditions, which could be seen as a breach of equality legislation. The attraction claimed that people were falsely using exemption cards, but failed to provide any basis for how they knew this to be the case. History Following a public meeting in 1890 to discuss an alternative method of communication between the two parts of Bridgnorth to the 200 steps between High Town and Low Town, a proposal to build a Patent Cliff Railway was put to the town council. Engineered by George Croydon Marks, plans were accepted for funicular railway on the current route. The Bridgnorth Castle Hill Railway Company Ltd was registered in 1891, and construction started on 2 November 1891. The company, which still operates the railway today, was founded by Sir George Croydon Marks (later Lord Marks of Woolwich), who became its first managing director from 1891 until 1901. His brother, Edward Marks, became its second managing director from 1901 until 1924. George was also the founder of the patent attorneys Marks & Clerk, who continue to trade. The railway was opened on 7 July 1892 by Mayor John Anderson, with a public holiday being proclaimed to celebrate the occasion. Most of the original funding came from George Croydon Marks' business partner, Sir George Newnes, MP, the wealthy publisher, who purchased eighty-five per cent of the share capital in Bridgnorth Cliff Railway and who became its first chairman. Newnes was already chairman of Lynton & Lynmouth Cliff Railway and went on to collaborate with Marks on other funicular projects. Newnes, who had previously founded Tit-bits and The Strand Magazine, went on to publish Country Life. Originally the railway was powered by a simple system using water and gravity. Water was pumped into a tank beneath the top car until its weight, a maximum of , overcame that of the lower car. When the car reached the bottom station the tank was emptied and pumped up to a tank on the top of the upper station. Between 1943 and 1944 the system was rebuilt to use electricity, with an official re-opening on 9 May 1944 by Mayor T.C. Pembro ‚Äì who had taken office only 2 hours previously. In 1955 the original heavy wooden cars were replaced by the 'up-to-date' stronger and lighter () aluminium monocoque ones still in use today. Each car can carry up to 18 passengers. The rails were replaced in about 1972 with the bullhead design formerly used on mainline railways. Current situation A vital part of the town's infrastructure the railway operates 362 days a year (it is closed on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day).

The current owners, who acquired the company and cliff railway in 2011, are direct descendants of George Croydon Marks' third cousin, all being descended from one Nicholas Jonas (later Jones) of Tawstock near Barnstaple, north Devon. Other descendants of Jonas were the brothers Tom and Bob Jones, who founded Lynton & Lynmouth Cliff Railway, which was also engineered by the Marks brothers. On 1 August 2015 Sir Robert McAlpine Bt unveiled a Transport Trust Red Wheel plaque at the cliff railway's top station commemorating Sir George Croydon Marks. A director of Lynton & Lynmouth Cliff Railway, and one of his sons, being distant cousins of both Marks and the current Bridgnorth directors, were present.

Various models of the LeapPad have been developed since 1999. Development history The device, resembling a talking book, took 3 years to develop and was introduced to the market in 1999. In 2001 (sales $160 million) and 2002 it was the best- selling toy in specialty stores. Sales in 2003 reached $680 million and were only eclipsed by sales of the book and cartridge add-ons. LeapStart is in red, Leap 1 is in orange, Leap 2 is in blue, and Leap 3 is in green. LeapPad was developed by a team from Explore Technologies, Inc. acquired by LeapFrog in July 1998. It uses the same patented \\"NearTouch\\" technology developed for the Explore Technologies Odyssey Atlasphere. Investigation and development was started in December 1997. Models Various models of the LeapPad were developed between its launch in 1999 and 2017: * LeapPad (original model) * LeapPad Plus Writing * Read and Write LeapPad * LeapPad Plus Microphone (also known as Read Aloud LeapPad) * LeapPad Pro * Quantum LeapPad * LeapPad Plus Writing and Microphone * Learn & Go LeapPad * Cocopad (released only in Japan) * LeapPad Explorer - The device is similar to Apple's iPad, but unlike the iPad, users can only download proprietary LeapFrog apps. The device has the capability to capture movies and take pictures. It was released in the summer of 2011. LeapFrog won the Platinum Award for LeapPad‚Ñ¢ from the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio in September 2011. * LeapPad2 (released in the summer of 2012) * LeapPad Ultra (released in the summer of 2013) * LeapPad3 (released in the summer of 2014) * LeapPad Platinum (released in the summer of 2015) * LeapPad Ultimate (released in February 2017) * LeapPad Academy (released in the summer of 2020) =Spin-offs incompatible with the mainstream series= The LeapPad's popularity helped spawn other LeapPad branded devices that are incompatible with the mainstream LeapPad series of players. These devices were meant for younger audiences who are not ready for the mainstream LeapPad's titles. * My First LeapPad - Targeted for preschoolers to Kindergarten-going children, the design of the LeapPad is different from a regular LeapPad in that the books are flipped upwards. The unit was later redesigned to be shaped like a school bus. A British-voiced version was also available in the UK. * LittleTouch LeapPad - Targeted for babies to toddlers, the unit operated significantly different from a regular LeapPad in that it did not require a stylus to operate. The unit also featured a soft pad underneath to allow for the device to sit comfortably on the parents' or toddler's lap. Technology The LeapPad is a computer with electrographic sensor. The sensor works as a capacitor and measures the amount of current flowing through corner electrodes into a plate beneath the table top, and uses that information to triangulate the location of the stylus on the table top. The LeapPad is covered by U.S. patents 5686705 and 5877458. Competition and comparisons The popularity of the LeapPad spawned a few competitions, most notably with Mattel and Fisher- Price who launched the PowerTouch Learning System in 2003,Fisher-Price PowerTouch site, accessed April 6 2009 and later with the Power Touch Baby. The PowerTouch Learning System was far more advanced than the LeapPad in many ways, requiring no stylus to operate as it uses a touch-sensitive area, and even the ability to detect page changes automatically via a set of infrared sensors on the top of the device(which also imposed a limitation on how many pages a book for the system can offer). However, despite the improvements and backing from popular brands like Nelvana and Scholastic, the PowerTouch did not catch on with the public as widely as the LeapPad did although it does have its share of followers. The LeapPad also faced competition from publisher Publications International, Ltd. whose specialty included electronic children books with sound modules. The ActivePoint and Magic Wand titles operated on a similar principle to the LeapPad.Magic Wand Book ActivePOINT However, the system faced limitations in that the book itself is bound to the reader and stylus and thus cannot be interchanged. Publications International later introduced the Story Reader and My First Story Reader system, which is more limited in function in that it will only read the story as the user turns the page, and features less interactive features: The Story Reader completely lacks any interactive functions, while the My First Story Reader only has simple quizzes answered through the use of three buttons at the bottom of the device. However, due to the lower cost of the system, Publications International's offering remained competitive with the LeapPad. The tablet range of the LeapPad also competed with VTech's InnoTab line of interactive tablet computers. Awards LeapPad won the first-ever People's Choice Toy of the Year (T.O.T.Y.) award, as well as the Educational T.O.T.Y. award in 2000, sponsored by the Toy Industry Association. In September 2011, LeapFrog won the Platinum Award for LeapPad(TM) from the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio.

It was originally published in The New Yorker magazine on April 8, 1974, and published in book form in 1976 in Divine Comedies. \\"Lost in Translation\\" is Merrill's most anthologized poem. Background Merrill wrote in his lifetime mainly for a select group of friends, fans, and critics, and expected readers of \\"Lost in Translation\\" to have some knowledge of his biography. Born in New York City, Merrill was the son of the founder of the world's largest brokerage firm. He enjoyed a privileged upbringing in economic and cultural terms, although his intelligence and exceptional financial circumstances often made him feel lonely as a child. Merrill was the only son of Charles E. Merrill and Hellen Ingram. (Merrill had two older half siblings from his father's first marriage.) Given that his parents were often preoccupied, his father with business, his mother with social obligations, Merrill developed a number of close relationships with household staff. \\"Lost in Translation\\" describes a profound childhood bond with the woman who taught him French and German. Merrill's parents would divorce in 1939, when Merrill was thirteen years old, in a scandal that was front-page news on the New York Times. Not only is \\"Lost in Translation\\" a poem about a child putting together a jigsaw puzzle, it is an interpretive puzzle, designed to engage a reader's interest in solving mysteries at various narrative levels. The poem is dedicated to Merrill's friend, the distinguished poet, critic, and translator Richard Howard. It consists of 215 lines with an additional four line epigraph. The poem is mainly in unrhymed pentameter but includes a section in Rubaiyat quatrain stanzas. \\"Lost in Translation\\" may be classified as an autobiographical narrative or narrative poem, but is better understood as a series of embedded narratives.  Epigraph  Unusual for Merrill, the poem bears a mysterious four-line epigraph in German (Rilke's translation of a poem by Val√©ry, which is printed without translation or attribution: : Diese Tage, die leer dir scheinen : und wertlos f√ºr das All, : haben Wurzeln zwischen den Steinen : und trinken dort √ºberall. In James Merrill's own English version of this epigraph (published in 1985 in Late Settings), these four lines are translated into English as follows: : These days which, like yourself, : Seem empty and effaced : Have avid roots that delve : To work deep in the waste.  Synopsis  \\"Mademoiselle does borders....\\" Merrill's childhood governess was from Alsace, on the border between France and Germany. In \\"Lost in Translation\\", the narrator's puzzle-making companion is his French governess, whom he repeatedly refers to as Mademoiselle. Part mother, part teacher, part nanny, part servant, she is described by Merrill as \\"stout, plain, carrot- haired, devout.\\" At one point in the poem, Mademoiselle speaks the same phrase in French and in German. In addition to playing with the boy's marionettes and doing jigsaw puzzles with him, Mademoiselle is teaching the young James Merrill languages which would be critical to making him the sophisticated and urbane lyric poet of later life. By giving name, in several languages, to objects and tasks around the home, Mademoiselle helps the young James Merrill come to understand a doubleness about language itself, that objects and activities can have different names and connotations across languages. From the child's point of view, the \\"puzzle\\" goes well beyond what is taking place on the card table. Merrill is puzzling through the mystery of his existence, puzzling through the mystery of what the world is, what objects are, what people do in life. An unspoken puzzle is solved when the young Merrill determines what his relationship to Mademoiselle is, given the frequent absence of his own mother. Mademoiselle knows \\"her place\\", he writes, indicating his first consciousness of his own class privilege, as well as (perhaps) the limits placed on Mademoiselle's maternal role. Yet other puzzles are not solved until later in life. At one point the narrator's voice modulates into that of an adult. We find out that Mademoiselle hid her true origins from the boy (and from his family) because of the political tensions leading up to 1939 and to the outbreak of World War II. Mademoiselle claimed to be French and hid her German or Alsatian birth. She presumably gained a French family name through marriage to a soldier who died in the Battle of Verdun in World War I (1914‚Äì1918). Mademoiselle could let no one know she was German for fear of losing her job and her employers' trust. This explains the fact that Merrill's own French, learned in imitation of his governess, was always spoken with a slight German accent. The boy finds out the full truth only as an adult, after a chance conversation with Mademoiselle's grown nephew, a United Nations interpreter, who tells him the story of the governess's true origins. The poem includes several other secondary narratives, including a section in which the puzzle itself is put together. Inspired by Omar Khayy√°m's Rubaiyat quatrains, Merrill describes an imaginary harem-like 19th century Orientalist painting, by an alleged follower of Jean- L√©on G√©r√¥me, that begins to appear as the puzzle pieces are put together. When the puzzle is nearly done, the piece that was missing the whole time is found under the table at the boy's feet. The missing piece is, in fact, an image of the boy's feet. When it is put in place, the portrait of the little boy in the puzzle is finally complete.

The first Golden Age of Television is the era of live television production in the United States, roughly from the late 1940s through the late 1950s. According to The Television Industry: A Historical Dictionary, \\"the Golden Age opened with Kraft Television Theatre on May 7, 1947, and ended with the last live show in the Playhouse 90 series in 1957;\\" Anthony Slide, ed., The Television Industry: A Historical Dictionary, Greenwood Press, 1991, p. 121. the Golden Age is universally recognized to have ended by 1960, as the television audience and programming had shifted to less critically acclaimed fare, almost all of it taped or filmed.  Limitations of early television  Prior to approximately 1948, there had been some attempts at television programming using the mechanical television process. One of the first series made specifically for television to have a sustained run was CBS's 1931‚Äì33 murder-mystery series The Television Ghost, which ran for all 19 months that its flagship television station, then W2XAB, was on the air. The limits of mechanical television inherently meant that these productions were extremely primitive; The Television Ghost, for example, consisted entirely of a 15-minute monologue of a single actor, with the only visual shot being the actor's head. By the time electronic television took over in the late 1930s, some more varied experimental programs, including live sportscasts and some game shows (such as the CBS Television Quiz and Truth or Consequences), were appearing; most television service was suspended beginning in 1942 because of World War II. The decade-long period of developing television techniques allowed broadcasting companies to be prepared when the war ended and the ensuing post-war prosperity allowed for increased consumer adoption of television sets. Early television broadcasts were limited to live or filmed productions (the first practical videotape system, Ampex's Quadruplex, only became available in 1957). Broadcasting news, sports and other live events was something of a technical challenge in the early days of television and live drama with multiple cameras was extremely challenging. A live, 90-minute drama might require a dozen sets and at least that many cameras. Major set and other changes had to occur during commercials, and there were no \\"second takes.\\" The cast and crew operated with the awareness of as many as 10 million people watching and any mistake went out live. After the adoption of videotape in 1957, many live dramas were shot \\"live to tape,\\" still retaining a \\"live\\" television look and feel but able to both preserve the program for later broadcast and allowing the possibility of retakes (still rare since videotape editing required a razor blade and was not done unless absolutely necessary). In Britain, from the very beginning of regular television broadcasting in 1936 and up until the 1980s, interior scenes for TV drama and comedy shows were shot with electronic cameras, while exterior scenes were shot with 16-mm film cameras. This arrangement conditioned British viewers to identify \\"live\\" look with interior scenes and \\"film\\" look with exterior scenes. In the U.S. and West Germany, most shows were produced completely in either film or video to avoid jarring difference in frame rate. Most other countries avoided outdoor shots for television productions as much as they could until portable video cameras became available. By the early 1960s, about 90% of American households had a television set, and the roles of television and radio (which was largely saved from obsolescence by the invention of the far more portable transistor radio in the 1950s and the concurrent rise of higher-fidelity FM radio) had changed, so that radio was primarily a medium for music, and scripted programming became wholly the domain of television.  Evolution of high-culture drama on television  The early days of television introduced hour-long anthology drama series, many of which received critical acclaim. Examples include Kraft Television Theatre (debuted May 7, 1947), The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre (debuted September 27, 1948), Television Playhouse (debuted December 4, 1947), The Philco Television Playhouse (debuted October 3, 1948), Westinghouse Studio One (debuted November 7, 1948), and Your Show Time (debuted January 21, 1949). High culture dominated commercial network television programming in the 1950s with the first television appearances of Leonard Bernstein and Arturo Toscanini, the first telecasts from Carnegie Hall, the first live American telecasts of plays by Shakespeare, the first telecasts of Tchaikovsky's ballets The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker and the first opera specially composed for television, Amahl and the Night Visitors. The Bell Telephone Hour, an NBC radio program, began its TV run featuring both classical and Broadway performers. The networks employed art critics, notably Aline Saarinen and Brian O'Doherty, something that was mostly discontinued by the start of the digital television era. As a new medium, television introduced many innovative programming concepts, and prime time television drama showcased both original and classic productions, including the first telecasts of Walt Disney's programs, as well as the first telecasts of Mary Martin in Peter Pan, MGM's classic The Wizard of Oz and Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella. The first screen adaptation of a James Bond story was a teleplay that aired in 1954. Critics and viewers looked forward to new teleplays by Paddy Chayefsky, Horton Foote, Tad Mosel, Reginald Rose, Rod Serling, William Templeton, Gore Vidal and others. A few of these teleplays, including Rose's Twelve Angry Men and Chayefsky's Marty, would be adapted for film and other media and go on to great acclaim. Most of these programs were produced as installments of live dramatic anthologies, such as The Philco Television Playhouse, Kraft Television Theatre and Playhouse 90. Live, abridged versions of plays like Cyrano de Bergerac, with members of the cast of the 1946 Broadway revival recreating their roles, were regularly shown during this period. Playhouse 90 was one of the last shows of its kind; by the late 1950s, production of most American television was moving to Hollywood, which itself carried a contrasting culture and sensibility to shows based in New York City, where most Golden Age programs originated.Dowler, Kevin. Museum of Broadcast Communications: Playhouse 90 This high culture approach to television could be interpreted as a product of its time as networks were concerned with \\"cultural uplift\\" and viewed it as a way to cultural legitimacy on the new medium. A similar uplift occurred in the late 1990s - early 2000s, when the networks were switching to high definition format. This was the time when Discovery Channel commissioned Discovery HD Theater to broadcast HD documentaries about nature and history, while BBC released Planet Earth. This coincided with the rise of the new Golden Age of Television that arose in the 21st century.  Blue-collar sitcoms and rural dramas  Many lightweight television programs of this era evolved from successful radio shows, which in turn originated from vaudeville stages, many of them in the Borscht Belt within driving distance of New York City. The radio stars, casts and writing staffs brought existing concepts to TV. The New York location also gave television networks access to established Broadway stars. Many of the early stars of television also had extensive film experience, either through short subjects or B-movies (though headline stars rarely made the jump); Lucille Ball, for example, was one of a number of women nicknamed \\"Queen of the B's\\" for her film work.Ball, Lucille- National Women's Hall of Fame This is one reason that quality was so consistently high during this period. I Love Lucy drew heavily from both film and radio. Many of the show's scripts were rewrites from Lucille Ball's late-1940s radio show My Favorite Husband. Shows like Gunsmoke and The Jack Benny Program ran concurrently on both radio and TV until television reception reached beyond the major metropolitan areas in the mid-1950s. while others, such as Father Knows Best and Fibber McGee and Molly, attempted to \\"flash- cut\\" from radio to television, to varying degrees of success.Fibber McGee & Molly-My Video Classics I Love Lucy, in particular, took extensive steps toward matching the quality of the radio writing with a cinematic look worthy of feature films; to this effect, they established a multi-camera setup (a revolutionary process that would become an industry standard in the decades to come) to allow for a live studio audience, hired cinematographer Karl Freund to oversee filming,and recorded the series on movie-quality 35 mm film (the relatively high cost prevented the show from being filmed in color as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz had originally hoped).Sanders, Coyne Steven; Gilbert, Tom (1993). Desilu: The Story of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz (William Morrow & Company, Inc.) pp. 72‚Äì81 End of the American golden age By the late 1950s, as television began reaching larger portions of rural America, their viewing habits began to be reflected in overall television ratings. Sylvester \\"Pat\\" Weaver was fired in 1956 after his strategy of programming highbrow \\"spectacular\\" productions once a month on NBC proved to be a ratings failure against more conventional fare on CBS. Rural sitcoms and Westerns boomed, perplexing even the writers of the shows and being treated as an opportunity for callous exploitation by the network executives, who nonetheless hated the programs, as did most critics. Americans' fondness for the rural sitcom and Western formats would last well into the 1960s. James Aubrey, the president of CBS Network from 1960 to 1965, introduced to television the shows like Mister Ed, Dick Van Dyke, The Beverly Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction, and Danny Kaye, in addition to already well-established Danny Thomas, Ed Sullivan, What's My Line?, Perry Mason, I Love Lucy, Gunsmoke. Characterized by a former colleague at ABC as having \\"a smell for the blue-collar\\", Aubrey later admitted: The nation as a whole was also tiring of high-culture programming as the Baby Boomers were beginning to come of age; over the next several years, high-culture programs would be relegated to public television, where older audiences with more money were tolerated. By the 1980s, enough highbrow enthusiasts had died off that even public television began resorting to more popular fare to maintain donations. A general decline in quality had been noticed as early as 1958, as the Peabody Award committee, in issuing an award to The Steve Allen Show that year, lamented that television was \\"conspicuously lacking (...) genuine humor and frank experiments.\\"Winners Archive Search from the Peabody Awards website As filmed series such as Alfred Hitchcock Presents and The Twilight Zone began to dominate during the mid-1950s and early 1960s, the period of live TV dramas was viewed as the Golden Age. Although producer David Susskind, in a 1960s roundtable discussion with leading 1950s TV dramatists, defined TV's Golden Age as 1938 to 1954, the quiz show scandals of 1958, a writer's strike in March 1960, the final show of Playhouse 90 (debuted October 4, 1956) on May 18, 1960, and the departure of leading director John Frankenheimer brought the era to an end. Indeed, the 1960‚Äì61 television season was noted by Time magazine as being the worst season in television up to that point, a sentiment echoed by Newton Minow, the head of the Federal Communications Commission, who lambasted the television networks for creating a \\"vast wasteland\\" of inferior programming in his speech \\"Television and the Public Interest.\\" (The United States Steel Hour would survive until 1963.) Dennis James, a Golden Age host who was still active into the early 1970s hosting game shows that were not always critically acclaimed, noted that as television gained critical mass, it had picked up viewers uninterested in high culture and the networks were adjusting to maximize their viewership. Defending his upcoming series The New Price Is Right in 1972, he remarked:VOLUME2NR2_art03.pdf In November 1960, Weaver commented on the end of the Golden Age of Television in The Denver Post, saying: \\"Television has gone from about a dozen forms to just two ‚Äì news shows and the Hollywood stories. The blame lies in the management of NBC, CBS and ABC. Management doesn't give the people what they deserve. I don't see any hope in the system as it is.\\"Fifties Television: The Industry and Its Critics, William Boddy, University of Illinois Press, 1992, , p. 252 The quality of television in the United States would begin to recover in the late 1960s with more experimental shows such as The Monkees and He & She..  Worldwide  = Canada = Canada's Golden Age of Television timeline is very similar to the US's (in fact, most Canadians were within the broadcast range of at least one American television station by the 1950s), but there is an overall five-year delay because of the country's sparser population. CBC Television, the country's official national broadcaster, launched in 1952, and CTV Television Network, the oldest commercial network in the country, followed in 1962. Although there were a handful of efforts to produce domestic content for the Canadian networks, most Golden Age shows were imported from the United States until the Can-Con requirements took effect around 1970. = Nigeria = Nigeria has the earliest television industry on the African continent and one of the earliest in the world. The Western Nigeria Television Service (WNTV), Nigeria's and Africa's first television station, began operation in the then Western Region in October 1959. The other two regions of the country soon followed suit; with the establishment of the Eastern Nigeria Television Service (ENTV) in Enugu, in 1960, and the Radio Television Kaduna (RKTV) in Kaduna, in March 1962. Also in 1962, The Federal Government established a fourth station, the Nigerian Television Service, in the then capital, Lagos. The numbers grew rapidly and in the mid-1980s, that every Nigerian state had its own broadcasting station. Laws were made by regulating bodies to limit foreign contents on television, with the National Commission recommending a minimum of 60 percent local programming content for all broadcasting stations. This led television producers to begin the broadcast of local popular theatre productions. Chinua Achebe's novel Things Fall Apart was adapted as a television series on National Television in 1987 and became very successful. At this time, Another very successful television adaptation was the adaptation of D.O. Fagunwa's 1949 novel Igbo Olodumare. The television series, which is of the same title witnessed a tremendous success, especially in South western states, where it was reported that the show constantly left streets deserted during its broadcast on Sunday evenings. Other television successes witnessed in the 1980s include series such as Adio Family, The Village Headmaster, Cock's Crow at Dawn, The Masquerade, Mirror in the Sun, Checkmate, Sura The Tailor, Second Chance and Awada Kerikeri. Hausa comedy soap operas such as Karkuzu and Karambana were also quite popular in this period. = South Africa = *South Africa was one of the last nations in the world to have TV; the apartheid government resisted TV broadcasting until the mid-1970s, with experimental broadcasts only beginning in 1975 and nationwide service starting in January 1976. = United Kingdom = British television, like its American counterpart, began developing in the 1930s, with the BBC Television Service beginning regular broadcasts in 1936. The early British television drama borrowed a great deal from dramatic radio productions developed between the First and the Second World Wars. In the 1920s the BBC pioneered dramatic readings of books. In 1925 it broadcast A Christmas Carol, which has become a holiday favourite. Later, John Reith, wanting to use radio waves to \\"part the clouds of ignorance\\", came up with the idea of a classic serial, based on a \\"classical\\" literary text. In 1939 the BBC adapted the romantic novel The Prisoner of Zenda for radio broadcast. Its adapter, Jack Inglis, summed up his approach as follows: \\"The story is simple, with clear cut characters, and falls easily into episodes. It always seems to me, that it is the first duty of an adapter to reproduce in another medium the original flavour and atmosphere of the book\\". Inglis compressed several characters into one and simplified the plotline. The production struck a chord with listeners and served as a prototype for dramatic productions that followed it. BBC television broadcasts ceased in 1939, as did the production of television receivers, resuming in 1946 after World War II. The golden age of British TV enjoyed its peak around the same time as in the United States, ranging from approximately 1949 to 1955 ‚Äì although the term has been used to describe the period right through until the 1970s.The History of the BBC: 1970s (BBC) = Soviet Union/Russia = The \\"Golden Age\\" of the Soviet media culture is usually associated with Khrushchev Thaw, which spanned from the mid-1950s until the end of 1960s. The live nature of television and relatively young age of the people involved in its development afforded certain level of exuberance, edginess, debate and criticism. Like in the United States, this period is notable for great many television plays broadcast on Soviet TV. For example, in 1951‚Äì1954 the Central Television Studio broadcast three to six plays a week. As time went on, the quantity and quality of the theatrical television productions diminished. The reasons were technical, social and economic. Staging a new production in a television studio every other day was expensive. The shortage of mobile cameras often precluded broadcasting live performance from a theater. Theaters became increasingly reluctant to offer their shows to TV, claiming that television draws the public away from theaters. Some theatrical directors prohibited actors to participate in TV shows. Theaters started demanding payment for broadcasting of their plays, and by the end of 1960s the frequency of theatrical shows fell to one show a week. Because the State Committee for Cinematography would hold freshly released movies from TV broadcast, television studios started producing their own made- for-TV movies. The Thaw ended with the crackdown of the Prague spring. The Soviet government deemed Czechoslovak mass media, which hosted political disputes and broadcast news about protesting students and young workers, to be complicit in undermining Communist rule in Czechoslovakia. Sergey Lapin, installed as the chairman of the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting in 1970, increased political oversight over television and banned shows that were critical of the system. Most programs except for the evening news were recorded beforehand and censored. This effectively ended the first \\"Golden Age\\" of the Soviet TV. The second \\"Golden Age\\" of television in Russia is associated with perestroika and glasnost of the late 1980s and with creation of private television companies in the 1990s. This period is notable for edgy talk shows and comedic productions that targeted youth, like Outlook, Till 16 and older, 12th Floor, Before and After Midnight, Oba-na. Political and economic news, live broadcasts from state Duma, critique of the government became standard fare of 1990s. In 2000s the Russian government increased its control over independent TV companies, and applied political and economic pressure to discourage them from criticizing the government and its policies. In 2001 Gazprom took ownership of the private TV company NTV, which aired several gritty programs. The satirical show Puppets, which mocked major politicians and celebrities, was terminated in 2002 after pressure from the Kremlin. In January 2002 another independent TV company TV-6 was terminated. In 2014, TV Rain was heavily criticized for asking viewers whether Leningrad should have been surrendered to the invading Nazi army in order to save hundreds of thousands of lives (since Hitler did not offer surrender as an option, only death). After that, the largest Russian TV providers stopped carrying the channel. Ultimately, left without money from broadcasters and advertisers, TV Rain was forced to move its studio to a private apartment. Contemporary independent TV broadcasters stick mostly to unoffensive soap operas and talk shows, leaving the political programming to government-owned channels.

Cover art for Levitt's book Slide Show (2005). Helen Levitt (August 31, 1913 ‚Äì March 29, 2009) was an American photographer. She was particularly noted for street photography around New York City, and has been called \\"the most celebrated and least known photographer of her time.\\" Early life and career Levitt was born in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of May (Kane), who was a bookkeeper before her marriage, and Sam Levitt, who ran a wholesale knit-goods business. Her father and maternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants.https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MJR8-X2K She dropped out of high school and in 1931 she learned how to develop photos in the darkroom when she began working for J. Florian Mitchell, a commercial portrait photographer in the Bronx. She saw the work of Henri Cartier-Bresson, a large influencer on her career, at the Julien Levy Gallery and for the first time saw photography as art. She practiced by photographing her mother‚Äôs friends with a used Voigtl√§nder camera. While teaching art classes to children in the mid-1930s, Levitt became intrigued with the transitory chalk drawings that were part of the New York children's street culture of the time. She purchased a Leica camera (with a right-angle viewfinder) and began to photograph these chalk drawings, as well as the children who made them. The resulting photographs were ultimately published in 1987 as In The Street: chalk drawings and messages, New York City 1938‚Äì1948. She continued taking more street photographs mainly in East Harlem but also in the Garment District and on the Lower East Side, all in Manhattan. During the 1930s to 1940s, the lack of air conditioning meant people were outside more, which invested her in street photography. Her work was first published in the Fortune magazine's July 1939 issue. Levitt received her first grant in 1946 from the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1959 and 1960, she received two grants from Guggenheim Foundation for her pioneering work in color photography. In 1965 she published her first major collection, A Way of Seeing. Much of her work in color from 1959 to 1960 was stolen in a 1970 burglary of her East 12th Street apartment. The remaining photos, and others taken in the following years, can be seen in the 2005 book Slide Show: The Color Photographs of Helen Levitt. However, she felt equally comfortable working with black and white, as she did both in the 1980s. In 1976, she was a Photography Fellow of the National Endowment for the Arts.  Connections to other artists  Levitt's influence from Cartier- Bresson was not only from viewing his work in galleries, but also once accompanying him on a day of shooting in New York City. Levitt also had a known connection with Walker Evans. In 1937 or 1938, she showed him her photographs of children playing. He found interest in them, and they worked together in 1938-39, taking pictures in the subway. It has been written that ‚Äúthe only photographers Evans ‚Äòfelt had something original to say were Cartier-Bresson, Helen Levitt and himself.‚Äô‚Äù On the same day that she showed her photographs to Evans, she met James Agee, who was an influence on her and also introduced her to poker. The two of them worked along with Janice Loeb, later her sister-in-law, on documentary films. Loeb also introduced Levitt to Luis Bu√±uel, whom she had her first film job with as an editor. Jeff Rosenheim, whom Levitt met at a showing of her work in Yale, also became a friend and joined her poker group. She was also friends with Thomas Roma, the director of the photography program at Columbia University for nearly 25 years.  Later life and death  Levitt lived in New York City and remained active as a photographer for nearly 70 years. However, she expressed lament at the change of New York City scenery: > \\"I go where there's a lot of activity. Children used to be outside. Now the > streets are empty. People are indoors looking at television or something.\\" She had to give up making her own prints in the 1990s due to sciatica, which also made standing and carrying her Leica difficult, causing her to switch to a small, automatic Contax. She was born with Meniere‚Äôs syndrome, an inner-ear disorder that caused her to ‚Äú[feel] wobbly all [her] life.‚Äù She also had a near-fatal case of pneumonia in the 1950s. Levitt lived a personal and quiet life. She seldom gave interviews and was generally very introverted. She never married, living alone with her yellow tabby Blinky until, at the age of 95, she died in her sleep on March 29, 2009.  Exhibitions  The new photography section of the Museum of Modern Art, New York included Levitt's work in its inaugural exhibition in July 1939. In 1943, Nancy Newhall curated her first solo exhibition \\"Helen Levitt: Photographs of Children\\" there. A second solo exhibit, Projects: Helen Levitt in Color, was held at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1974. Her next major shows were in the 1960s; Amanda Hopkinson suggests that this second wave of recognition was related to the feminist rediscovery of women's creative achievements. = Selected retrospectives = * 1983: Street Portrait: The Photographs of Helen Levitt Museum of Fine Arts, Boston * 1985: Moderna Museet, Stockholm * 1988: The Photographers' Gallery, London * 1991: San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (toured nationally 1991‚Äì1993) * 1994: , Spain (and tour) * 1997: International Center of Photography, New York * 2001: Centre national de la photographie, Paris * 2007: , Paris * 2008: Foam Fotografiemuseum Amsterdam * 2008: Sprengel Museum, Hannover (Accompanied her award for the Spectrum International Photography Prize) * 2010: PHotoEspa√±a, Madrid (and tour) * 2018: Albertina Museum, Vienna Bibliography    Filmography  In the late 1940s, Levitt made two documentary films with Janice Loeb and James Agee: In the Street (1948) and The Quiet One (1948). Levitt, along with Loeb and Sidney Meyers, received an Academy Award nomination for The Quiet One. Levitt was active in film making for nearly 25 years; her final film credit is as an editor for John Cohen's documentary The End of an Old Song (1972). Levitt's other film credits include the cinematography on The Savage Eye (1960), which was produced by Ben Maddow, Meyers, and Joseph Strick, and also as an assistant director for Strick and Maddow's film version of Genet's play The Balcony (1963). In her 1991 biographical essay, Maria Hambourg wrote that Levitt \\"has all but disinherited this part of her work.\\" In 2012 Deane Williams published a comprehensive overview of Levitt's films in Senses of Cinema.

The protagonists are Michael Murray (played by Robert Lindsay), the hard-left Labour leader of a city council in the North of England, and Jim Nelson (played by Michael Palin), the headmaster of a special school. The series was controversial partly because Murray appeared to be based on Derek Hatton, former Deputy Leader of Liverpool City Council ‚Äî in an interview in the G.B.H. DVD Bleasdale recounts an accidental meeting with Hatton before the series, who indicates that he has caught wind of Bleasdale's intentions but does not mind as long as the actor playing him is 'handsome'. In normal parlance, the initials 'G.B.H.' refer to the criminal charge of grievous bodily harm (i.e. causing someone serious injury). However, Bleasdale claimed in an interview on the DVD that the title is supposed to stand for 'Great British Holiday'. Plot outline The story is set in an unspecified city in the North of England, during a period in which local left- wing councils are vying for increased autonomy from the Thatcher government. Michael Murray, an aggressive, womanising Labour councillor, returns to his old primary school and burns copies of school records which describe an event that almost caused him to be committed to a juvenile offenders' institution. He intimidates the elderly headmaster, Mr. Weller, and dispatches him to a rural, lower-status special needs school run by the popular headteacher Jim Nelson. Murray meets with three members of the Militant tendency far-left politician Lou Barnes, academic Mervyn Sloane and 'fixer' Peter Grenville, who persuade him to call a general strike in order to protest the government's policies. Due to the incompetence of Murray's supporters, Nelson's school is not picketed and remains open, making it a focus for journalists, including tabloid writer 'Bubbles' McGuire, eager to discredit the strike. Murray tries to coerce Nelson, a moderate Labour member, into joining the strike. When this fails, criminal thugs hired by Grenville besiege the school and terrorise the children. Over the next few months, Nelson's school is picketed and his family are harassed at their home. Already a hypochondriac, Nelson develops a collection of neuroses under stress, including an inability to drive his car over a local bridge. However, his neighbours remain sympathetic and he is assured by a local farmer, Mr. Burns, that the majority of traditional socialists in the area will defend him against the militants. Conflicted between his ambition and his conscience, Murray encounters a wealthy woman named Barbara Douglas, who appears to admire him despite his crude manners. At the same time, he receives a taunting letter purporting to be from Eileen Critchley, the victim of his unspecified childhood crime, which drives him into hysterics. The letter has, in fact, been delivered secretly by Barbara. Murray's elder brother and chauffeur, Franky, grows tired of his arrogance and kicks him out of the car, leaving him stranded by the side of the road. Increasingly isolated and humiliated, Murray becomes more paranoid and unstable. He starts to develop a repertoire of involuntary tics and spasms which become increasingly difficult to conceal. Barbara unsuccessfully tries to trick Mr. Weller into handing over his copies of Murray's school file. Mr. Weller correctly suspects something is happening and delivers the file to Nelson for safekeeping. Meanwhile, Nelson's pacifist composure is beginning to crack: when menaced by a drunken skinhead, he suddenly and vengefully chases the man down in his car before being stopped by his wife. When Murray visits Nelson's school again and attempts to wheedle him into compliance, Nelson punches him. Murray and Grenville then instigate a militant takeover of Nelson's local Labour branch, aiming to have him expelled from the party. More letters from Eileen arrive. Unknown to Murray, they are not part of a personal vendetta, but in fact a conspiracy consisting of Barbara, Barnes and Grenville aimed at destabilising him. Hoping to provoke riots across the city, Barnes and Grenville arrange for a series of racist assaults on ethnic minorities. Meanwhile, Murray's suspicious wife searches for him in the hotel where he entertains his mistresses, reducing him to a nervous wreck. Needing more time to gather evidence against Murray, the conspirators order Barbara to calm him down by seducing him, which she duly does. Murray temporarily regains his sanity after his tryst and addresses community representatives to over the riots. To the dismay of the plotters, he addresses the meeting with surprising skill and persuades the audience to refrain from vigilantism. Joining the plotters, Barbara admits that she enjoyed her liaison with him. Nelson's family go on holiday and stays in a hotel run by Grosvenor, an impoverished aristocrat. On privately discovering Nelson's neuroses, he becomes sympathetic; the two men vent their frustrations over the collapse of English decency. Meanwhile, the plotters search the Nelsons' house for the file, only to discover that Nelson has taken it with him. Meeting with McGuire, Barnes and Grenville reveal that they are in fact intelligence agents who have infiltrated Labour in order to root out the militants. Having discovered that the genuine hard-left had apparently withered, they have resorted to gaslighting Murray and staging the riots to discredit and destabilise the opposition. Grenville's brother (another of the conspirators) attempts to retrieve the file from the Nelsons' holiday home, but is discovered by Nelson, who suspects that he was sent by Murray and beats him severely with a tennis racket. Posing as CID police officers, the plotters then raid the holiday home and successfully retrieve the file. Returning home, Nelson appears at his local Labour branch, to defend himself against charges made by the conspirators of working against the party. Driven by guilt, Murray makes an oblique and faltering private attempt to reconcile himself with Nelson, but is furiously rebuffed. Greville's thugs find themselves outnumbered by both the local members and the Labour-supporting farmers, who show up in support for Nelson; the motion for Nelson's expulsion is rejected. Meanwhile an arrest warrant is issued against Murray for inciting the riots. Barbara is revealed to be Eileen's younger sister, who repeatedly victimised Murray during their childhood. Having had a morbid fascination with death during her girlhood, Eileen once cajoled the young Murray into choking her ‚Äî the secret that Murray has been trying to hide. Eileen eventually killed herself. After a lifetime of vengeful feelings towards Murray, Barbara finally accepts that he was a victim. In recompense, Barbara helps Murray to secretly record a conversation in which the plotters admit their intention to provoke riots. She leaves him a recording of the confession, as well as revealing the information absolving him of any guilt about Eileen. Murray abandons his ambitions and resigns himself to his political fate, allowing Barbara to deliver him to the police. However, as she parts company with Barnes, Barbara reveals that his attempts to prevent the recording were unsuccessful. As Murray faces his fate, the Nelsons look to the future, still ignorant of much of what has happened beyond their own immediate lives. Nelson finally manages to drive his car across the bridge which had previously defeated him.

The islands were vital naval and air bases on the route between the Americas and the Philippines and Australia and were claimed by both the United Kingdom and the United States. From 1939 to 1979, they formed an Anglo-American condominium, with administration jointly exercised by the U.S. and the UK. This arrangement only covered Canton and Enderbury islands; the remaining Phoenix Islands were still claimed by the U.S. under the Guano Islands Act, but aside from Hull Island were either abandoned or remained under exclusive British control until 1979. The United States and the United Kingdom relinquished control over the islands to the government of newly independent Kiribati under the Treaty of Tarawa in 1979 and the Canton and Enderbury Islands Condominium ceased to exist. In this treaty, the U.S. acknowledged I-Kiribati sovereignty over fourteen islands, but reserved the right to military bases.US Department of State Background Note Today the islands form part of the Phoenix Islands administrative group within the Republic of Kiribati. As of 2005, the population of Canton Island was 41, down from 61 in 2000. In May 2010 the population was reportedly 24, with 14 adults and 10 children. The island's sole village is called Tebaronga.

The term fruticulture‚Äîintroduced from Romance languages (all of whose incarnations of the term descend from Latin and )‚Äîis also used. Pomological research is mainly focused on the development, enhancement, cultivation and physiological studies of fruit trees. The goals of fruit tree improvement include enhancement of fruit quality, regulation of production periods, and reduction of production cost. One involved in the science of pomology is called a pomologist. History Pomology has been an important area of research for centuries. =United States= During the mid-19th century in the United States, farmers were expanding fruit orchard programs in response to growing markets. At the same time, horticulturists from the USDA and agricultural colleges were bringing new varieties to the United States from foreign expeditions, and developing experimental lots for these fruits. In response to this increased interest and activity, USDA established the Division of Pomology in 1886 and named Henry E. Van Deman as chief pomologist. An important focus of the division was to publish illustrated accounts of new varieties and to disseminate research findings to fruit growers and breeders through special publications and annual reports. During this period Andrew Jackson Downing and his brother Charles were prominent in Pomology and Horticulture, producing The Fruits and Fruit Trees of America (1845). The introduction of new varieties required exact depiction of the fruit so that plant breeders could accurately document and disseminate their research results. Since the use of scientific photography was not widespread in the late 19th century, USDA commissioned artists to create watercolor illustrations of newly introduced cultivars. Many of the watercolors were used for lithographic reproductions in USDA publications, such as the Report of the Pomologist and the Yearbook of Agriculture. Today, the collection of approximately 7,700 watercolors is preserved in the National Agricultural Library's Special Collections, where it serves as a major historic and botanic resource to a variety of researchers, including horticulturists, historians, artists, and publishers..

The story focuses on the effects of alcohol. Throughout this story Carver experiments with the use of quotation and meditates on the healing factors of storytelling. This story also lends its title to a collection of thirty-seven short stories compiled by Carver, Where I'm Calling From: New and Selected Stories. Plot synopsis The main character, an unnamed man, has been dropped off at Frank Martin's alcohol rehabilitation center by his girlfriend, not to be confused with his wife. After arriving he encounters J.P. who starts telling him his story. J.P. is a drunken chimney sweep whose father-in-law has recently dropped him off at Frank Martin's as well. He tells the story of how he met his wife, Roxy, one afternoon at his friend's house. She was a chimney sweep that asked to kiss J.P.‚Äôs friend when she was done cleaning his chimney when J.P. asked for a kiss as well. As J.P. continues his story it becomes about how alcohol has ruined his marriage to his wife. The story ends with the main character contemplating calling his wife or calling his girlfriend. The title comes from the last few lines where he says: > I won't raise my voice. Not even if she starts something. She'll ask me > where I'm calling from, and I'll have to tell her. I won't say anything > about New Year's resolutions. There‚Äôs no way to make a joke out of this. > After I talk to her, I‚Äôll call my girlfriend. Maybe I‚Äôll call her first. > I‚Äôll just have to hope I don‚Äôt get her kid on the line. ‚ÄúHello, sugar,‚Äù I‚Äôll > say when she answers. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me.\\" Use of Alcohol Alcohol and the importance of storytelling both play major roles in this story. J.P.‚Äôs story as well as many other alcoholic stories is in a tripartite form. It begins with his great life before the drink, the way the drink affected his marriage, and now with his stay at Frank Martin‚Äôs it will include his life after the drink. Frank Martin‚Äôs rehabilitation center literally becomes the means of the characters' sobriety, and it seems that without it they would not be able to dry out. Carver uses Jack London as a metaphor in this story as well. Jack London used to live on the other side of the valley in which Frank Martin‚Äôs is located. This makes the men realize that since the drink affected someone as talented and strong as London, they cannot handle it either. He also speaks of the half dog and half wolf creature in The Call of the Wild. Just like this animal, the drink makes you half domestic and half wild. Towards the end of the story Jack London is referred to again in regard to his story \\"To Build a Fire.\\" This is a metaphor for the main character and for J.P. drying out. Building a fire literally gives hope and is a symbol for life, and whether the man will call his wife or his girlfriend is uncertain, but perhaps he is just trying to build a fire and create hope and life for himself. There is also thought that the story's structural basis of domestic and wild, or unnatural and natural, is intended to be broken down, suggesting that structuring life via the unnatural (such as taking a second life partner or attending alcohol rehabilitation) suppresses the natural, recreating the subject, I. It is hinted in the story that submission to the unnatural structure is a natural process, and that, as is made particularly evident in the metaphor presented in \\"To Build a Fire,\\" the natural is always capable of deconstructing the unnatural, requiring reconstruction and further development of the \\"I.\\" Essentially, the thought provoked is that the natural, or instinctual and the unnatural, or forced structure, are entirely reliant upon one another.

It is owned by the Didcot Railway Centre. Service Life 5051 Was built at Swindon Works in May 1936 and was named after Drysllwyn Castle, it carried this name for the first 18 months of its working life before being renamed to Earl Bathurst in August 1937 (the name coming from a de-named GWR Dukedog Class no 3208/9008), this name it would carry for the rest of its GWR & BR working career. Its original name would later be applied to classmate no 7018. It was first allocated to Landore depot in Swansea and was to remain there for its GWR working career as well as most of its BR days until Jun 1961 when it was transferred to Neath (87A). Its final shed allocation was to Llanelly (87F) in Feb 1963 and was to remain there for the remainder of its working career until May 1963 when it was withdrawn from service after completing 1,300,000 miles. It was later sold to Woodham Brothers in Oct of the same year.http://www.greatwestern.org.uk/barry1.htm Preservation The locomotive was bought by John Mynors from the scrap yard and was sold following his death. The locomotive was sold to the Great Western Society at Didcot Railway Centre and left by rail as the 4th departure from Barry in March 1969. Following its arrival at Barry Scrapyard it was to remain at Barry Island for 5 years until 1969 when it was purchased by the GWS and moved to Didcot by rail for restoration. It was restored to steam in 1979 and was reunited with its original Drysllwyn Castle nameplates. It was a regular performer in 1985 during the 150th anniversary celebrations of the Great Western Railway. Its previous working stint saw its return to steam in 1998 following an overhaul at Didcot and it was later returned to mainline service, on one occasion in the summer of 2003 it stood in for 7802 Bradley Manor working the Torbay Express, promoted by Past-Time Rail. (7802 was booked to work the trains from Bristol Temple Meads to Kingswear and return, but on the first train of the season Bradley Manor developed a hot axle box and was unable to haul the next two outings which saw 5051 take the Manor's place). Compared to the Manor which could only run at 60 mph it was able to operate at 75 mph so managed to keep to the timetable without problem. 7802 returned for the 31 August and 7 September trips. It ran for most of its ticket in lined GWR green with the letters GW on its tender, prior to withdrawal it was later repainted to BR lined green with the early emblem on its tender. Its boiler ticket later expired in 2008. At present it is unlikely 5051 will be overhauled for a while due to the current ongoing overhaul of GWR Castle Class 4079 Pendennis Castle which will provide Didcot with an operational Castle, and with GWR King Class 6023 King Edward II currently operational that will provide the centre with two GWR express locomotives in traffic. Alongside this a number of fellow preserved Castles are undergoing overhauls. In preservation it has run with both Collett and Hawksworth tenders, it was paired with a Collett tender following its restoration from scrapyard condition in the 1970s and alongside a brief stint with a Churchward tender following its overhaul in 1998 it was later paired with a Hawksworth tender which it used for its previous boiler ticket. It has now once again been paired with a Collett tender while on display in the Great Western Society's engine shed at Didcot.

The company became GE Healthcare following a takeover in 2003, which is based at the original site in Amersham, Buckinghamshire. History Chilcote House in Amersham was first used for extraction of radium from radium concentrates in 1940, under Walter Patrick Grove. Over the next four years over 500 kilograms of radium bromide was produced, to be used to make luminous dials and instruments. In 1946 the facility was taken over by the Ministry of Supply and it became known as the ‚Äúnational centre for the processing and distribution of radium, radon and artificial radioactive substances for scientific, medical and industrial purposes‚Äù. With a new focus on healthcare and industrial applications, the site was expanded and by 1949 when the name changed to \\"The Radiochemical Centre (TRC), Amersham\\", production included radium gas capsules for cancer treatment and carbon-14. The following year it became an outstation of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (UKAERA) at Harwell, processing materials produced in its reactors. By the 1960s, TRC had over 1000 catalogue items, using over 100 isotopes and exporting to 60 countries. A cyclotron was installed, the first for medical isotope production. With restructuring of the UKAERA in 1971, TRC became a limited company. By this time TRC had several international subsidiaries, and in 1976 work began on a second production site in Cardiff. The Radiochemical Centre Limited became Amersham International Limited in 1981 and was the first company to be privatised by the Thatcher Government in 1982 under the new name Amersham International plc. It was the first privatisation in which the government sold 100% of its shares in a company. The offer was 24.6 times subscribed, meaning the share price rose from 142p per share to 188p per share by closing on the first day. The government retained a special share, allowing the veto of any outsourcing attempts, until it was redeemed in 1988. In the early 1990s, the in-vitro diagnostic assay business was divested to a joint venture with Eastman Kodak called Amerlite Diagnostics Ltd, this was later wholly acquired by Eastman Kodak and renamed Kodak Clinical Diagnostics Ltd. This business was sold by Kodak to Johnson & Johnson and became known as Johnson & Johnson Clinical Diagnostics Ltd. The business is now called Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Ltd. In 1997 Pharmacia Biotech (Sweden), then owned by Pharmacia & Upjohn, was fused with Amersham Life Science and renamed Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The Pharmacia name of this subsidiary was later dropped when Pharmacia & Upjohn sold its share of the company to Amersham plc, and changed its name to Amersham Biosciences in 2001. In 1997, Amersham merged with Nycomed (Norway) to form Nycomed Amersham plc. In 1999, the Nycomed Pharma subsidiary was sold to Nordic Capital, and in 2001 Nycomed Amersham plc was renamed to Amersham plc. In 2004, Amersham was acquired by the American firm General Electric (GE) and incorporated into the GE Healthcare business segment. Operations The global headquarters of GE Healthcare is in Little Chalfont (near Amersham). It is the first GE business unit headquarters outside the United States. In 2018 part of the company's Cardiff site was sold for redevelopment as operations consolidated into a smaller area. Amersham's former business segments became GE Healthcare Medical Diagnostics and GE Healthcare Life Sciences.

It is a Ramsar site and a Special Protection Area. Aerial view from the south-east. Portsmouth harbour with the Spinnaker Tower on the right. The masts of and HMS Victory are visible in the background. It is a large natural harbour in Hampshire, England. Geographically it is a ria: formerly it was the valley of a stream flowing from Portsdown into the Solent. At its north end is Portchester Castle, of Roman origin and the first fortress built to protect the harbour. The lower end of Portsmouth harbour at the end of the 19th centuryThe mouth of the harbour provides access to the Solent. It is best known as the home of the Royal Navy, HMNB Portsmouth. Because of its strategic location on the south coast of England, protected by the natural defence of the Isle of Wight, it has since the Middle Ages been the home to England's (and later Britain's) navy. The narrow entrance, and the forts surrounding it gave it a considerable advantage of being virtually impregnable to attack from the sea. Before the fortifications were built the French burned Portsmouth in 1338. During the civil war parliamentary forces were able to carry out a successful cutting-out expedition within the harbour and capture the six-gunned Henrietta Marie. In modern times, the harbour has become a major commercial ferry port, with regular services to Le Havre, France, Cherbourg, France, St Malo, France, The Channel Islands and the Isle of Wight. There is a passenger ferry to Gosport. It is also a major area for leisure sailing. In 2006 the Gunwharf Quays development, including the Spinnaker Tower, was opened on the site of HMS Vernon (a former naval shore establishment). Islands Portsmouth Harbour contains a number of islands. Whale Island is the home of the training establishment . Horsea Island is now connected to the mainland due to land reclamation. It is also part of HMS Excellent. Pewit Island is a small island located in the north western section of Portsmouth Harbour. Closer to the harbour entrance on the Gosport side is Burrow Island, also known as Rat Island. Camber Dock The historic Camber Dock and Camber Quay, February 2008 Camber Dock is the oldest developed part of the Portsmouth Harbour complex. Lying within the historic area of Old Portsmouth, it is part of Portsmouth Point that lies outside the original fortified boundaries of Portsmouth. After improvements in the King James's and Landport Gates and the areas military defences, civilian building of dockside storage and ancillary servicing facilities began from 1590. With major ships anchored at Spithead, from the 18th century the surrounding area became noted as a popular but lewd area for visiting sailors. With advent of bigger steam powered ships, the physical restrictions of Camber Dock meant that it was bypassed for the larger capacity of the newer developed Portsmouth Harbour. Resultantly, Camber Quay became the home of the local fishing fleet, which it still remains today, together with the adjacent dockside development of the commercial fish market. Today it also has a series of visiting berths for non-commercial craft. In 2015, the Land Rover BAR yacht racing headquarters was completed. Portsmouth ferry port =Launch= Portsmouth investigated three locations for a ferry port at the end of the 1960s and the current location was chosen. The choice was based on cost and the likely benefit of cross-channel ferries. The site was at the end of the newly constructed M275. Originally built with two berths the site opened in 1976 with the Earl William (Sealink) running to the Channel Islands, the Viking Victory (Townsend Thoresen) running to Cherbourg and the Brittany Ferries running to Saint-Malo. =Expansion= All three operators increased their usage of the port during the mid-eighties, which led to expansion. An additional two berths were built, both twin tier. Berth 2 was filled and a new Berth 2 built, which was mainly used by the Earl Granville (Sealink) running to both the Channel Islands and Cherbourg, Berth 1 become more tight to use and the newly roll-on, roll-off Commodore Shipping used it for their Channel Island freight services. Berth 3 was left incomplete while Berth 4 was finished. This was generally considered the Brittany Ferries berth. When Berth 3 was finished Townsend Thoresen moved their passenger operation entirely from Southampton to Portsmouth. Shortly afterwards, Townsend Thoresen bought P&O; (Normandy Ferries) and relocated them to Portsmouth. The old Southampton Ferry port was then converted to a marina. The continued use of Portsmouth saw the creation of Berth 5 and the final stage of development. Portsmouth had seen additional ferry companies Channel Island Ferries, Hoverspeed and Truckline and new routes to Caen, Santander and Bilbao. With the advent of the Channel Tunnel and the abolition of Duty Free most of the companies disappeared. Sealink merged their Channel Island operations with the newly created Channel Island Ferries to create British Channel Island Ferries. They then later relocated operations to Poole before merging into Condor Ferries. Sealink operated to Cherbourg with the Earl Granville for several further years until the Earl Granville violently ran aground off Cherbourg. Hoverspeed ran the HOVERSPEED GB from Portsmouth to Cherbourg intermittently one summer ‚Äì often the \\"new ferry of the future\\" was out of action and the now repaired but ageing Earl Granville would step into the breach ‚Äì much to passenger annoyance. =Decline= upright By 2000 Portsmouth only had ferries from Brittany Ferries, Condor and P&O.; P&O; replaced the ageing Super Vikings with a Ro-pax ship and a Sea-Cat on the Portsmouth-Cherbourg route, but by 2006 P&O; had all but closed its operation from Portsmouth but retained the route to Bilbao and Portsmouth became a quiet port again. After P&O; Ferries withdrawal from the Le Havre route in September 2005 a new company stepped in to replace them with LD Lines running one sailing a day to Le Havre with the Norman Spirit. The Spanish ferry company Acciona tried briefly in 2006 to compete on the northern Spain route to Bilbao using their ferry the Fortuny, but it lasted 3 months before closure. =Today= Today, Brittany Ferries operates a three times daily service to Caen, daily to St Malo, daily to Le Havre and offers a high-speed seasonal service to Cherbourg, which runs daily. On Friday, Saturday & Sunday it is increased to twice daily. Brittany Ferries also has up to six sailings a week to Spain with two departures to Bilbao and four to Santander. Condor Ferries have two sailings a day to the Channel Islands with a morning sailing to the Islands with the passenger and freight ferry Commodore Clipper and an evening sailing to the islands with the freight-only ferry Commodore Goodwill. The sole remaining P&O; service to Bilbao ceased in September 2010 but has since been replaced by Brittany Ferries as of April 2011 with two sailings a week using their modern and fast ferry Cap Finistere which can make the trip from Portsmouth to Bilbao in 24 hours with a top cruising speed of 27 knots. On 10 May 2011 the New Terminal building at the newly renamed Portsmouth International Port' was opened by Vince Cable MP. As well as the regular ferry sailings there were 45 cruise ships that called at the port during 2018 with several of them being turnaround calls. Regular calls are undertaken by CMV Cruises, Crystal Cruises, Hapag Lloyd, Phoenix Reisen, Saga Cruises, Viking Ocean Cruises, Windstar Cruises.

It is of national importance for dark-bellied Brent geese and for three species of waders, grey plover, black-tailed godwit and dunlin. Proposed Tunnel A tunnel crossing the mouth of the Harbour between Gosport and Portsmouth was proposed in 1941, which would have allowed pedestrian traffic while doubling as a subterranean air raid shelter for residents on both sides. This proposal came during the Blitz, which saw Portsmouth and Gosport bombed heavily. The proposal, termed the \\"Kearney Tube\\" after the Australian engineer conducting the initial study, evolved into a proposal for rail link tunnel in 1942, but the project was never constructed.https://historicgosport.uk/kearney-tube/ In 1999, a study was undertaken by the Light Rail Transit Association in regard to a proposed tunnel crossing to alleviate traffic congestion in the area, particularly Gosport. Of three construction methods examined, an immersed tube was deemed to be the most effective, as it would not necessitate closing the harbour for over a year, but rather a series of shorter closures of around 24 hours for the addition of each segment of the tunnel. The tunnel would be approximately 1km in length, though only around 670m of this would be underwater.https://trid.trb.org/view/505401 The tunnel would have been part of a light rail network connecting Fareham, Gosport and Portsmouth.https://www.railwaygazette.com/news/south-hants-lrt/25698.article The South Hampshire Rapid Transit Order 2001 provided authorisation for the projecthttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2001/3627/contents/made, with construction intended for 2002, but financial problems delayed this.

He portrayed Andy on TV's The Amos 'n' Andy Show and directed films including the 1941 race film The Blood of Jesus. Williams was a pioneering African-American film producer and director. Early career Williams (who was sometimes billed as Spencer Williams Jr.) was born in Vidalia, Louisiana, where the family lived on Magnolia Street. As a youngster, he attended Wards Academy in Natchez, Mississippi. He moved to New York City when he was a teenager and secured work as call boy for the theatrical impresario Oscar Hammerstein. During this period, he received mentoring as a comedian from the African American vaudeville star Bert Williams. Williams began his studies at the University of Minnesota, taking some time out to serve his country. Williams served in the U.S. Army during and after World War I, where he rose to the rank of sergeant major. During the course of his time in service, Williams traveled the world, serving as General Pershing's bugler while in Mexico before he was promoted to camp sergeant major. In 1917, Williams was sent to France to do intelligence work there. After World War I, Williams continued his military career; he was part of a unit whose job was to create war plans for the Southwestern United States, in case they might ever be needed. He arrived in Hollywood in 1923 and his involvement with films began by assisting with work on Octavus Roy Cohen material. Williams began to snag bit roles in motion pictures, including a part in the 1928 Buster Keaton film Steamboat Bill, Jr. Though he had found steady work since arriving in California, Williams had a short period in 1926 where there were no roles for him; he then went to work as an immigration officer. In 1927, Williams was working for the First National Studio, going on location to Topaz, Arizona to shoot footage for a film called The River. In 1929, Williams was hired by producer Al Christie to create the dialogue for a series of two-reel comedy films featuring an all-black cast. As Williams began to gain the trust of Christie, he was eventually appointed the responsibility to create The Melancholy Dame. This film is considered the first black talkie. Due to the pressures of the depression coupled with the lowering demand for black short films, Williams and Christie separated ways. Williams struggled for employment during the years of the Depression and would only occasionally be cast in small roles. Movies included a brief appearance in Warner Bros.‚Äô gangster film The Public Enemy (1931) in which he was uncredited.Cripps, Thomas. \\"The Films of Spencer Williams.\\" Black American Literature Forum 12.4 (1978): 128-34. St. Louis University. Web. 5 Nov. 2014. . The films, which played on racial stereotypes and used grammatically tortured dialogue, included The Framing of the Shrew, The Lady Fare, Melancholy Dame, (first Paramount all African- American cast \\"talkie\\"), Music Hath Charms, and Oft in the Silly Night. Williams wore many hats at Christie's; he was a sound technician, wrote many of the scripts and was assistant director for many of the films. He was also hired to cast African-Americans for Gloria Swanson's Queen Kelly (1928) and produced the silent film Hot Biscuits in the same year. Williams also did some work for Columbia as the supervisor of their Africa Speaks recordings. Williams was also active in theater productions, taking a role in the all African-American version of Lulu Belle in 1929. By 1931, Williams and a partner had founded their own movie and newsreel company called the Lincoln Talking Pictures Company. The company was self-financed. Williams, who had experience in sound technology, built the equipment, including a sound truck, for his new venture. Film directing During the 1930s, Williams secured small roles in race films, a genre of low-budget, independently-produced films with all-black casts that were created solely for exhibition in racially segregated theaters. Williams also created two screenplays for race film production: the Western film Harlem Rides the Range and the horror-comedy Son of Ingagi, both released in 1939. After a three-year hiatus from show business during the Great Depression, Williams began finding work again. He was cast in Jed Buell‚Äôs Black westerns between the years of 1938 and 1940. He played character roles in such black westerns as Harlem on the Prairie (1937), Two- Gun Man from Harlem (1938), The Bronze Buckaroo (1939), and Harlem Rides the Range (1939). Buell‚Äôs idea to hire Williams revolved around his ability to captivate the audience with his showmanship. Williams‚Äô involvement in these films gave him a valuable learning experience in the black film genre. Although these films were considered to be crude films in their creation, Williams got the opportunity to start directing here and there even though his control was scarce. Alfred N. Sack, whose San Antonio, later Dallas, Texas based company Sack Amusement Enterprises produced and distributed race films, was impressed with Williams‚Äô screenplay for Son of Ingagi and offered him the opportunity to write and direct a feature film. At that time, the only African American filmmaker was the self-financing writer/director/producer Oscar Micheaux. Besides being a film production company, Sack also had interests in movie theaters. He had more than one name for his ventures; they were also known as Sack Attractions and Harlemwood Studios. Sack produced films under all of his company's various names. With his own film projector, Williams began traveling in the southern US, showing his films to audiences there. During this time, he met William H. Kier, who was also traveling the same circuit showing films. The two formed a partnership and produced some motion pictures, training films for the Army Air Forces, as well as a film for the Catholic diocese of Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Blood of Jesus Theatrical release poster for The Blood of Jesus (1941), Williams's directorial debut. Williams's resulting film, The Blood of Jesus (1941), was produced by his own company, Amegro, on a $5,000 budget using non-professional actors for his cast. It was the first film he directed and Williams also wrote the screenplay. A religious fantasy about the struggle for a dying‚Äô Christian woman‚Äôs soul, the film was a major commercial success. Sack declared The Blood of Jesus was \\"possibly the most successful\\" race film ever made, and Williams was invited to direct additional films for Sack Amusement Enterprises. There were problems that the producers faced with the technical aspects of the film. Despite these issues, Williams used his expertise to help with the camera, special effects and symbolism. The themes that he used in the film helped the film receive praise. Religious themes, including Protestantism and Southern Baptist, helped underpin the narrative.Giles, Mark. \\"The Blood of Jesus: Timeless Black Values.\\" Black Camera 15.1 (2000): 6-7. Indiana University Press. Web. 5 Nov. 2014. . Despite the success that The Blood of Jesus enjoyed, Williams's next film was considered an epic failure and seen by few. The attempt to create a wartime drama resulted in the film Marching On! (1943). Set with World War II as the backdrop, the film was badly made and was left in the shadow of the Army financed film The Negro Soldier (1944). Most of the narrative seen in Marching On was influenced by William‚Äôs own time in the army during World War I. Due to an uneven and uninteresting plot the film was seen as a dud and was unable to garner the social acknowledgment that Williams had hoped it would receive. Williams's next film, Go Down Death (1944), is considered to be on par with The Blood of Jesus as the best overall primitive film? that Williams made. Just like that movie, Williams directed, wrote the screenplay, and acted in the film. He gained inspiration for the story of the screenplay from the fable of the same name, written by the poet James Weldon Johnson. The years after his most successful films and the years preceding his mainstream success with Amos 'n' Andy found Williams in another career rut. Rather than continuing to make film in his primitive format, he began to try to follow mainstream Hollywood conventions. Williams's attempts to conform in the film industry actually began to bog down his stories and his otherwise original films. In the next six years, Williams directed Brother Martin: Servant of Jesus (1942), Marching On! (1943), Go Down Death (1944), Of One Blood (1944), Dirty Gertie from Harlem U.S.A. (1946), The Girl in Room 20 (1946), Beale Street Mama (1947) and Juke Joint (1947). After working ten years in Dallas, Williams returned to Hollywood in 1950. Following the production of Juke Joint, Williams relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he joined Amos T. Hall in founding the American Business and Industrial College. Amos 'n Andy Prior to his involvement with Amos 'n' Andy, Williams was immensely popular among the African-American audiences. U.S. radio comedians Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, who cast Williams as Andy, were able to claim that they were the ones who found Williams and gave him the chance to be seen in the limelight because he was virtually unknown amongst the white audience.Erickson, Hal. \\"Spencer Williams Biography.\\" New York Times. The New York Times Company. Web. 5 Nov. 2014. . In 1948, Gosden and Correll were planning to take their long-running comedy program Amos 'n Andy to television. The program focused on the misadventures of a group of African Americans in the Harlem section of New York City. Gosden and Correll were white, but played the black lead characters using racially stereotypical speech patterns. They had previously played the roles in blackface make-up for the 1930 film Check and Double Check, but the television version used an African American cast.Andrews, Bart and Ahrgus Juilliard. \\"Holy Mackerel!: The Amos ‚Äòn' Andy Show.\\" New York: E.P Dutton, 1986. Gosden and Correll conducted an extensive national talent search to cast the television version of Amos 'n Andy. News of the search reached Tulsa, where Williams was sought out by a local radio station that was aware of his previous work in race films. A Catholic priest, who was a radio listener and a friend, was the key to the whereabouts of Williams. He was working in Tulsa as the head of a vocational school for veterans when the casting call went out. Williams successfully auditioned for Gosden and Correll, and he was cast as Andrew H. Brown. Williams was joined in the cast by New York theater actor Alvin Childress, who was cast as Amos, and vaudeville comedian Tim Moore, who was cast as their friend George \\"Kingfish\\" Stevens. When Williams accepted the role of Andy, he returned to a familiar location; the CBS studios were built on the former site of the Christie Studios. Until Amos 'n' Andy, Williams had never worked in television. Amos 'n Andy was the first U.S. television program with an all-black cast, running for 78 episodes on CBS from 1951 to 1953. However, the program created considerable controversy, with the NAACP going to federal court to achieve an injunction to halt its premiere. In August 1953, after the program had recently left the air, there were plans to turn it into a vaudeville act with Williams, Moore and Childress reprising their television roles. It is not known if there were any performances. After the show completed its network run, CBS syndicated Amos 'n Andy to local U.S. television stations and sold the program to television networks in other countries. The program was eventually pulled from release in 1966, under pressure from civil rights groups that stated it offered a negatively distorted view of African American life. The show would not be seen on nationwide television again until 2012. While the show was still in production, Williams and Freeman Gosden clashed over the portrayal of Andy, with Gosden telling Williams he knew how Amos 'n' Andy were meant to talk. Gosden never visited the set again. Williams, along with television show cast members Tim Moore, Alvin Childress, and Lillian Randolph and her choir, began a US tour as \\"The TV Stars of Amos 'n' Andy\\" in 1956. CBS considered this a violation of their exclusivity rights for the show and its characters; the tour came to a premature end. Williams, Moore, Childress and Johnny Lee, performed a one-night show in Windsor, Ontario in 1957, apparently without any legal action being taken. Williams returned to work in stage productions. In 1958, he had a role in the Los Angeles production of Simply Heavenly; the play had a successful New York run. \\"\\"Simply Heavenly,\\" sung by Everdinne Wilson and Robert DeCoy, was most appealing. ... Spencer Williams was, of course, his own inimitable self, ... (pay-per-view) \\"Spencer Williams and Bob de Coy scored in the colored review Simply Heavenly at the Carmel Theater.\\" (pay-per-view) His last credited role was as a hospital orderly in the 1962 Italian horror production L'Orribile Segreto del Dottor Hitchcock. After his failed attempts to find success in the film industry once again, Williams decided to fully retire and began to live off of his pension that he was receiving from his time with the US Military. Death and legacy Williams died of a kidney ailment on December 13, 1969, at the Sawtelle Veterans Administration Hospital in Los Angeles, California. He was survived by his wife, Eula. At the time of his death, news coverage focused solely on his work as a television actor, since few white filmgoers knew of his race films. The New York Times obituary for Williams cited Amos 'n Andy but made no mention of his work as a film director. A World War I veteran, he is buried at Los Angeles National Cemetery. When friends and family from Vidalia, Louisiana were interviewed for a local newspaper article in 2001, he was remembered as a happy person, who was always singing or whistling and telling jokes. His younger cousins also recalled his generosity with them for \\"candy money\\"; just as he was seen on television as Andy, he always had his cigar. On March 31, 2010, the state of Louisiana voted to honor Williams and musician Will Haney, also from Vidalia, in a celebration on May 22 of that year. Career re-evaluation Despite his contribution as a pioneer in black American film of the 1930s and the 1940s, Williams was almost completely forgotten after his death.Moon, Spencer. Reel Black Talk. Greenwood, 1997. Print. While even to this day his legacy doesn‚Äôt enjoy the same recognition and praise that other black film pioneers such as Oscar Micheaux, in his time, Williams was considered one of the few successful black Americans involved in the film industry during this period.Duncan, Melba J. The Complete Idiot's Guide to African American History. Indianapolis, IN: Alpha, 2003. Print. Recognition for Williams‚Äô work as a film director came years after his death, when film historians began to rediscover the race films. Some of Williams‚Äô films were considered lost until they were located in a Tyler, Texas, warehouse in 1983. One film directed by Williams, his 1942 feature Brother Martin: Servant of Jesus, is still considered lost. There were seven films in total; they were originally shown at small gatherings throughout the South. Most film historians consider The Blood of Jesus to be Williams‚Äô crowning achievement as a filmmaker. Dave Kehr of The New York Times called the film \\"magnificent\\" and Time magazine counted it among its \\"25 Most Important Films on Race.\\" In 1991, The Blood of Jesus became the first race film to be added to the U.S. National Film Registry. Film critic Armond White named both The Blood of Jesus and Go Down Death as being \\"among the most spiritually adventurous movies ever made. They conveyed the moral crisis of the urban/country, blues/spiritual musical dichotomies through their documentary style and fable-like narratives.\\" However, Williams‚Äô films have also been the subject of criticism. Richard Corliss, writing in Time magazine, stated: \\"Aesthetically, much of Williams' work vacillates between inert and abysmal. The rural comedy of Juke Joint is logy, as if the heat had gotten to the movie; even the musical scenes, featuring North Texas jazzman Red Calhoun, move at the turtle tempo of Hollywood's favorite black of the period, Stepin Fetchit. And there were technical gaffes galore: in a late-night scene in Dirty Gertie, actress Francine Everett clicks on a bedside lamp and the screen actually darkens for a moment before full lights finally come up. Yet at least one Williams film, his debut Blood of Jesus (1941), has a naive grandeur to match its subject.\\" It should also be realized that Williams often worked on a very meager budget. The Blood of Jesus was filmed for a cost of $5,000; most black films of that era had budgets of double and triple that amount. Williams began writing a book about his 55 years in show business in 1959.

It consists of the underwater B√∏mlafjord Tunnel from Sveio to the island of F√∏yno, the Stord Bridge from there to Stord, and a road including the B√∏mla Bridge and the Spiss√∏y Bridge to B√∏mlo. The section from Sveio to Stord is part of European Route E39, while the branch to B√∏mlo is part of County Road 542. The B√∏mlo Tunnel is long and reaches below mean sea level. It is the longest subsea tunnel in Norway and was the deepest in the world when it opened. The Stord Bridge and B√∏mla Bridge are both suspension bridges, with lengths of and main spans of . The Spiss√∏y Bridge is a beam bridge. The link is long toll road with a toll plaza on F√∏yno. The section from Stord to B√∏mlo has a pedestrian and bicycle path. Plans for a link between B√∏mlo and Stord were first launched as a pontoon bridge in the 1960s. In the late 1980s, the plans evolved into a triangular project. There was controversy surrounding the project, in particular from environmentalists. The Parliament of Norway passed the plans in 1996, and construction started the following year. The bridges and link between Stord and B√∏mlo opened on 28 December 2000, while the tunnel opened on 30 April 2001. The link cost 1.8 billion Norwegian krone (NOK) after substantial cost overruns and remained a toll road until 30 April 2013. Route description Overview of the Triangle Link, with the Stord Bridge to the right, the B√∏lmo Bridge in the middle, Spiss√∏y Bridge to the right and the B√∏lmafjord Tunnel below the fjord up to the right The Triangle Link is part of two routes, European route E39 and County Road 542. The section from Stord to Sveio, including the Stord Bridge and the B√∏mlafjord Tunnel, is part of the E39 highway (the Coastal Highway) which runs along the west coast of Norway. The section from the interchange on the island of F√∏yno, including the B√∏la Bridge and the Spiss√∏y Bridge, is on County Road 542. The link acts both as a mainland connection for Stord and B√∏mlo to the mainland at Sveio, as well as a link between the two island communities, which have a combined population of 30,000.Hauge: 7 The B√∏mlafjord Tunnel is a long subsea tunnel which crosses B√∏mlafjorden. It is wide, tall and reaches below mean sea level. The tunnel has three lanes, one downhill and two uphill, with the direction of the extra lane switching at the bottom.Hauge: 109 When it opened, it was the longest and second-deepest subsea tunnel in Europe. Stord Bridge is a suspension bridge which crosses Digernessundet, connecting Stord with F√∏yno. It is long and has a main span (distance between the pylons, or towers) of . The bridge is wide and has a clearance of .

The bridge has two tall pylons, one foundationed on Brunsholmen and one on Spiss√∏y. The bridge has a similar aesthetically design to the Stord Bridge, and also features a steel deck with concrete pylons.Hauge: 106 It has the fifth-longest span in Norway. Spiss√∏y Bridge is a beam bridge which crosses Gassasundet, connecting B√∏mlo with Spiss√∏y. It is long, consists of five spans and has a clearance of . The fixed link project also included of highway. On Stord, E39 received a new two- lane, limited-access road from Meatj√∏rn to the bridge. This included a new grade separated (two-level) interchange in the southern part of Leirvik and a culvert‚Äîthe Digernes Tunnel‚Äîimmediately before the bridge. In Sveio, the link included of new limited-access road from the tunnel to a grade-separated interchange at Dalshovda. In B√∏mlo, there was a new road built across the islands of Spiss√∏y and Naut√∏y‚Äîincluding an intersection on Spiss√∏y. It further consisted of a new section of road from the B√∏mlo side of Spiss√∏y Bridge at Gassasundet to R√∏yksund, and from Gassasundet to Gr√∏vle, including a new tunnel through Stokkajuvet. A combined pedestrian and bicycle path runs along the whole section between Stord and B√∏mlo, with a grass division on the land parts between the road and the path. Underpasses and walls were built with natural stone.Hauge: 102 The tolls are collected at a toll plaza located on F√∏yno. The plaza is constructed as a grade-separated intersection, so that any car passes through the plaza once. However, traffic only traveling between F√∏yno to B√∏mlo does not have to pay. Cars driving along E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza, while cars to or from B√∏mlo need to use the interchange. There is also an intersection allowing access to the island. The plaza has six lanes, of which two in each direction have a toll booth and one in each direction has an automatic collection. The toll station uses the Autopass toll collection, which allows passage without stopping, in addition to manual collection.Hauge: 110 Passengers, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcyclists and mopeds are free.Hauge: 111 As of 2011, the fees are NOK 85 for cars and NOK 270 for trucks. Frequent travelers can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount. History =Pontoon bridge proposals= MF Hordaland at Skjersholmane in the early 1990s The first recorded proposal for a connection between B√∏mlo and Stord was made in the 1960s by sheriff, and later mayor of Fitjar, Finn Havner√•s. Christened the Island Road, he proposed a series of eleven bridges and causeways which would run from Kalveid in Fitjar via Brandasund to Rolfsnes in B√∏mlo. While local politicians were not opposed to the plan, the recent municipal merger between B√∏mlo, Bremnes and Moster made them prioritize other sectors and the project was abandoned without any official investigations.Hauge: 32 A new route was launched by B√∏mlo Mayor Malvin Meling, who proposed a pontoon bridge which would cross Stokksundet. He was inspired by the plans to build what would become the Nordhordland Bridge north of Bergen. In 1973, the municipal councils of B√∏mlo, Stord and Fitjar decided to launch a planning process, which concluded that a pontoon bridge between S√∏rstokken and Foldr√∏yholmen would be optimal. The report also considered bridges across the Fitjar Archipelago and a crossing via Spiss√∏y and F√∏yno. There were protests from Wichmann Motorfabrikk who were concerned about their operations if the sound was closed for shipping traffic. Similar protests also came from the shipping industry, who wished to continue using Stokksundet; the protests were not remedied by the plans including a suspension bridge across Foldr√∏ysundet. To illustrate their point, one shipowner let two of his ships cross in the middle of Foldr√∏ysundet.Hauge: 33 The shipping industry received support from Norwegian Coastal Administration and the plans were abandoned in 1974. In the early 1980s, plans for Stord Airport, S√∏rstokken were launched. The bridge plans across Stokksundet were again brought up in 1982 as the industry on B√∏mlo wanted to not have use a ferry to reach the airport. A committee with representatives from all three municipalities was established in May 1983 to look into the possibilities for a bridge. Led by B√∏mlo Mayor Arne M. Haldorsen, it issued Engineer Harald M√∏yner the task to author a report and recommendation. He made three proposals: a pontoon or suspension bridge between Foldr√∏yhomen and Litlaneset; a suspension bridge between Setraneset and Sokkbleikjo, which would terminate just south of the new airport; and a combined fixed link between Spiss√∏y and Digernes, without passing via the Fitjar Archipelago. The latter was the first time a fixed link to the mainland was proposed. The Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration protested against a possible suspension bridge near the airport, but stated that one closer further away would be fine.Hauge: 34 Mapping of traffic patterns on B√∏mlo was undertaken by Hordaland Public Roads Administration in 1984, and based on this and other feedback, a pontoon bridge between Foldr√∏yholmen and S√∏rstokken was recommended. It was estimated to cost NOK 190 million, in addition to auxiliary roads for NOK 40 million. Following the opening of the Vard√∏ Tunnel in 1982, the first subsea tunnel in Norway, Engineer Finn Nitter d.e. proposed a fixed link which involved a combined bridge, road and tunnels between the islands, including a suspension bridge over Digernessundet, a causeway and low bridge onwards to a subsea tunnel under Spiss√∏ysundet and a low bridge over Gassasundet. In addition, a long tunnel would have had to be constructed from F√∏yno to Ulver√•ker in Sveio. MF Bj√∏rnefjord at Skjersholmane in the late 1990s The company Johannes S√∏rlie launched an all-tunnel proposal in 1985, which would cost NOK 700 million and give of subsea tunnel connecting B√∏mlo to Stord and the mainland. The committee was positive to the proposals, while Josef Martinsen, director of Hordaland Public Roads Administration, stated that the project was unrealistic. Sveio Municipality was subsequently invited as a member of the planning committee. On 14 May 1985, the committee voted to encourage the municipal councils to pass planning which involved a bridge across S√∏rstokken, and aimed to get the plans into Norwegian Road Plan 1990‚Äì1993. The committee continued its work until it dissolved itself in October 1986 and was replaced by the limited company Ytre Sunnhordland Bru- og Tunnelselskap AS (SBT). The company was owned by the municipalities of B√∏mlo, Stord, Fitjar and Sveio, Hordaland County Municipality and the banks Bergen Bank, Sparebanken Vest, Vestlandsbanken, Haugesund Bank and Christiania Bank.Hauge: 35 A new master plan for the project was completed by the Public Roads Administration in December 1986. It proposed four main routes: via the Fitjar Archipelago; via Foldr√∏yhamn with a pontoon bridge to S√∏rstokken; a suspension bridge from S√∏treneset to Stokkbleikjo; or via Spiss√∏y, Naust√∏y and F√∏yno to Digernes. They recommended choosing the pontoon bridge. SBT stated that this was only to be a first stage, and that a second stage should involve a tunnel to the mainland. In a meetingbetween SBT and representatives for the shipping industry at the end of 1986, it was decided that SBT would start working for a mainland connection that would not hinder sailing.Hauge: 36 A report published by SBT in 1987 looked at details for a subsea tunnel to the mainland. It was the first official document to use the \\"Triangle Link\\" term, although this had previously been used by the press. A delegation traveled to Washington state in the United States and British Columbia in Canada to look at their seven pontoon bridges, while seismic surveys were undertaken in B√∏mlafjorden. SBT changed its name to Sunnhordland Bru- og Tunnelselskap and a majority of the board shifted towards being in favor of a fixed link. The issue became the subject of major local debate and was supplemented by a demand from residents in southern B√∏mlo that they did not want to lose their ferry service, which would be faster than driving via the fixed link.Hauge: 37 =Opposition= The Coastal Administration stated that they would not allow a pontoon bridge.Hauge: 38 SBT decided on 26 June 1987 to work towards receiving permission to collect advanced tolls on the ferry services.Hauge: 39 On 16 September, they unanimously supported the triangular proposal, which was estimated to cost NOK 660 million.Hauge: 40 This was criticized by Hordaland Public Roads Administration, who stated that it would take longer time to plan‚Äîand thus complete‚Äîthe Triangle Link.Hauge: 42 A poll from January 1988 showed that 78.6 percent of the population of B√∏mlo wanted the Triangle Link, while 8.6 percent wanted the pontoon bridge. On 6 January, SBT started negotiating loans with various banks to receive financial guarantees for the Triangle Link, and by February sufficient funding had been secured.Hauge: 44 From 1988, environmentalists started actively opposing the Triangle Link. The most active was the local chapter of the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, which stated that the road would have serious consequences for the local boat traffic to the recreational islands of F√∏yno and Naut√∏y. Instead, they recommended that the municipalities chose a pontoon bridge.Hauge: 49 An action group was established. Hallgeir Matre stated that Stord had a lack of beaches and that the two islands \\"were the last low, forested islands in the area after the paradise Eld√∏yane had been converted to an industrial area for Aker Stord during the 1970s\\".Hauge: 50 He further stated that environmentalists were skeptical to floating bridges, but that in this case it would be the lesser of two evils. The Stord Society for the Conservation of Nature applied for municipal grants to make a critical report, but this was rejected by the majority of the municipal council. By June, a new chapter had been established on B√∏mlo, and the group stated that it was irresponsible to build a link which would result in a massive increase in car use. Future In Our Hands started a petition which collected 1,600 signatures. A poll from 1990 showed that in Stord, 35 percent were in favor of the project, while 36.7 percent were opposed, given that the ferry service was improved, among other things with night ferries and increased comfort. Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public.Hauge: 51 Gisle Tjong was another opponent, who stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the accumulated funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in B√∏mlo there was overwhelming support. However, in southern B√∏mlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.Hauge: 52 =Political processes= Entrance to the B√∏mlafjord Tunnel from the mainland B√∏mlo Municipal Council voted unanimously in favor of the Triangle Link on 22 February 1988. Two days later, the issue was discussed in Stord Municipal Council. Olav Akselsen at first proposed supporting the pontoon bridge, but after a trial vote he withdrew the proposal and also Stord supported the Triangle Link. The following week, Sveio Municipal Council voted in favor the Triangle Link, without either a debate or dissent in the council. Fitjar Municipal Council voted on 15 March to work with both proposals.Hauge: 45 Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a pontoon bridge, and stated that two and a half years of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989, estimating the costs at NOK 890 million. It recommended that the Langev√•g‚ÄìBuav√•g Ferry remain, but the other four ferry services be terminated.Hauge: 46 The report concluded that the maintenance costs of the fixed link would be lower than the subsidies of the ferry, that the project would be economical of society and would reduce emissions.Hauge: 47 During late 1989, advance tolls on the ferries were approved by the municipal councils and the county council, who recommended that collection start from 1 July 1990, but this was not immediately supported by the government. On 18 and 19 September 1990, the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications visited the region and looked at the proposed areas of the Triangle Link, the Hardanger Bridge and the Folgefonna Tunnel. By then it had been established that the Triangle Link would not need state grants, as it could be entirely financed with tolls. Tore Haugen, Conservative parliamentarian from Akershus, proposed that the project be considered independent of the regular national road plans. However, Lars Gunnar Lie, Minister of Transport and Communications from the Christian Democratic Party, stated that he planned a single report to Parliament for all three projects.Hauge: 48 In 1991, the master plan was appealed by the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature to the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The appeal was seconded by the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management. In the 1991 municipal election, the Socialist Left Party was the only party which was opposed to the fixed link, and they received a large increase in votes,Hauge: 54 increasing for 7 to 21 percent in Stord. The same year, Dag Hareide in the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature started lobbying up towards national politicians in an attempt to stop the issue in Parliament. High-profile people who were opposed to the project included Per St√•le L√∏nning, Herborg Kr√•kevik and Kenneth Sivertsen. The issue of advanced tolls was reviewed by the county council on 23 October 1991, where 64 voted in favor and 19 were opposed, the latter representing the Socialist Left Party, the Red Electoral Alliance and the Progress Party. In June 1992, the county council was asked to prioritize between the Hardanger Bridge and the Triangle Link, as there would not be sufficient state grants to build both projects. Both would require between NOK 200 and 300 million, and it would not be possible to start both projects in the period from 1994 to 1997.Hauge: 57 In the council meeting on 18 June 1992, a proposal to waiver prioritization was rejected. The council then, with 44 against 30 votes, chose to prioritize the Hardanger Bridge, which received most votes from the Labour and Centre Party. The Conservative Party was the only party for which all the votes were cast in favor of the Triangle Link. The Socialist Left Party's proposal to build neither received 11 votes.Hauge: 58 In July, the master plan was passed by the Council of State.Hauge: 59 On 10 December 1992, Parliament approved advanced payment of tolls on the ferry, which were made effective from 1 January 1993. Ticket prices increased with between NOK 10 and 12. This resulted in protests from the ferry employees who stated that they would have to collect the tolls which would remove their jobs; Norwegian Seafarers' Union representatives stated that they considered suing the state.Hauge: 60 Work on the development plan started in 1992. It included safety and environmental improvements which increased the project's cost by NOK 200 million. In May 1994, it was made subject to consultative statements. Norwegian Road Plan 1994‚Äì97 was considered by Parliament during 1993. Minister of Transport and Communications, Kjell Opseth of the Labour Party, stated that he wanted to equally prioritize the Triangle Link and the Hardanger Bridge, but that it would be unrealistic to build both in the same period. At a county council meeting on 21 April 1993, the council decided with 60 against 20 votes that the county would not prioritize between the two projects.Hauge: 61 Opseth subsequently stated that in his opinion, the Triangle Link should be prioritized. In 1995, a report on the Coastal Highway (E39) was presented, which recommended that the Skjersholmane‚ÄìValev√•g Ferry be removed.Hauge: 62 Particularly within the Labour Party there was disagreement about whether or not to build the Hardanger Bridge.Hauge: 63 In addition to crossing the Hardangerfjord, there were concerns that the bridge would increase the traffic through Hardangervidda National Park, and that it subsequently would result in an all-year road being built with subsequent negative impact on nature and wildlife. Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of the Labour Party stated on 10 October 1995 that the government was in favor of the Triangle Link and opposed to the Hardanger Bridge. When the standing committee visited the two projects in 1996, they were met by demonstrators in favor of the bridge in Hardanger, and demonstrators in opposition to the fixed link in Sunnhordland. In May, SBT proposed building a culvert on Digernes as a compromise for a proposal from the Labour Party and the Christian Democratic Party to consider other solution, which could have postponed the project several years. Parliament decided on 11 June 1996, with 144 against 20 votes, to build the Triangle Link. The Folgefonna Tunnel was also passed, while the Hardanger Bridge was put aside.Hauge: 64 =Construction= Construction started on 15 February 1997. Before the first blast could be taken by County Mayor Magnar Lussand, representatives for Vestlandet Natue and Youth, and The People's Movement Against the Triangle Link had to be moved. The only police officer at the festivities was Sheriff Reidar F√¶restrand, who was not dressed in his police uniform and had not brought with him his badge. The demonstrators did not move until a police boat had been sent with the necessary documentation and F√¶restrand could prove his identity as a law enforcer. Elin Lerum Boasson of Nature and Youth stated that it was \\"a day of sorrow\\".Hauge: 66 Stord Bridge with Stord to the left Core samples showed that the tunnel would have to be built deeper than originally planned to avoid deposits.Hauge: 67 The tunneling was undertaken by NCC Eeg-Henriksen from the F√∏yno side and by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration from the Sveio side.Hauge: 108 Construction from Sveio started on 16 September 1997 and from F√∏yno on 6 March 1998.Hauge: 156 The tunnel was built at an average speed of per week, with the record being . The lowest point was reached on 5 May 1999 and the breakthrough took place on 2 September, five months before schedule. Sixty people participated in a course to master fear of tunnels organized by the toll company.Hauge: 90 When it opened, the tunnel was the longest and second- deepest subsea tunnel in Europe and Norway, after the Hitra Tunnel. The Stord and B√∏mla Bridges were both constructed using the same method and by the same contractors, Arbeidsfellesskapet Triangle Contractor, a joint venture between NCC Eeg-Henriksen and HBG Steel Structures.Hauge: 77 Construction started on the Stord Bridge on 20 February 1999. After the pylons were completed,Hauge: 105 two catwalks were erected between them, with the constructors choosing a continual catwalk instead of three separate ones. The cables were spun on-site using a reel; this also allowed for cost savings, as the reels could be used two times. The cables were spun using the air spinning with controlled tension, which allowed spinning with little space use and with a crew with limited experience with spinning.Hauge: 80 The two bridges were the first time that on-site spinning was used in Norway. The fastening poles were delivered five weeks after schedule; a new mounting method was developed which allowed them to be installed in a quarter of the time, in part by using a helicopter, and the whole five-week delay was eradicated. This allowed the deck sections to be installed as scheduled.Hauge: 82 The decks were produced in Schiedam, Netherlands, for the Stord Bridge and in Italy for the B√∏mlo Bridge. These were sent by barge to Sunnhordland.Hauge: 86 The section length was different between the two bridges, the Stord Bridge having them in lengths of and the B√∏mla Bridge in sections of . This was to accommodate the latter's smaller vertical curvature.Hauge: 83 The entire project cost NOK 1,814 million. The costs were distributed to NOK 476 million for the B√∏mlafjord Tunnel, NOK 433 million for the Stord Bridge, NOK 336 million for the B√∏mla Bridge, NOK 46 million for the Spiss√∏y Bridge, NOK 36 million for the Digernes Tunnel, NOK 325 million for roadways and NOK 172 for administration and common costs. The investment cost was split between state grants and NOK 1,036 million in debt taken up by the toll company. When the project was passed by Parliament it had a budget of NOK 1,260 million. The Office of the Auditor General of Norway criticized the Western Norway Public Roads Administration in 2001 for a total cost overrun of NOK 900 million in three projects, the Triangle Link, the L√¶rdal Tunnel and parts of National Road 555. The majority of the cost overruns were tied to the Triangle Link. As a consequence, Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm stated that future large road investments would have an external quality assurance before being presented to Parliament. =Opening and operation= B√∏mla Bridge The first part of the link, between Stord and Sveio, including the Stord Bridge and B√∏mlafjord Tunnel, was taken into use on 27 December 2000. The official opening and the National Road 542 opening took place on 30 April 2001. The opening of the first stage allowed two ferry services to be replaced, the Skjersholmane‚ÄìValev√•g Ferry, which connected Stord to Sveio, and the Skjersholmane‚ÄìUtbjoa Ferry, which connected Stord to Vindafjord. With the opening of the B√∏mlo connection, the two remaining ferries could be closed: the Sagv√•g‚ÄìSiggjarv√•g Ferry, which connected Stord with B√∏mlo, and the Mosterhamn‚ÄìValev√•g Ferry, which connected B√∏mlo to Sveio. The Langev√•g‚ÄìBuav√•g Ferry, which connects the southern part of B√∏mlo to Sveio, was not closed. In 2000, the four closed ferry services transported 884,216 vehicles and 1,935,875 people.Hauge: 100 From the start the toll plaza used Autopass, a standard which allows automatic passage through the toll plaza without stopping. The system was launched by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration in 2001 and the Triangle Link was the first to take the system into use. The tollway was also the first in the country to allow subscriptions to be made via the Internet. The initial charges were NOK 75 for cars up to or length, NOK 225 for small trucks, between , and NOK 450 for longer vehicles. In 2004 the Public Roads Administration published a report documenting high administration costs in the 46 toll companies throughout the country. Along with the company for the Oster√∏y Bridge, SBT received the harshest criticism in the report. Especially a trip made by Chairman Harry Herstad and his wife to San Francisco to participate at a conference was criticized, as it cost the toll company NOK 118,000. Also annual board member fees of NOK 200,000 and excessive trips for the board were commented as wasted money. The internal audit concluded with that there were costs of NOK 300,000 in 2002 and 2003 which were not properly documented or were not used in line with regulations. The report was rejected by the board, who claimed that several of the issues were misunderstandings and that the Public Roads Administration was using the report in a campaign to establish a state-run toll collection agency. √òyvind Halleraker withdrew as managing director of SBT and as chairman of the Norwegian Road Financing Companies Association in January 2005. He was at the time also member of parliament for the Conservative Party. As a consequence of the report, Hordaland County Municipality demanded an extraordinary annual meeting be held in February, in which chairman Harry Herstad was replaced. P√•l K√•rb√∏ was elected new chairman. At the same time the annual meeting demanded that the company withdraw from its various tasks related to establishing toll projects on B√∏lmo and Halsn√∏y as well as administrative work of the Norwegian Road Financing Companies Association. In a 2007 report from the Public Roads Administration, SBT was one of seven toll companies which was criticized for too high administration costs. The toll changed the operator of the toll plaza from Bru- og Tunnelselskapet to Vegamot in 2010. The same year the toll plaza had 1,910,280 passing vehicles and a revenue of NOK 142 million. This made it the ninth-largest toll road in Norway by revenue. The toll collection was scheduled to be completed on 30 April 2013.

Kyriakos S. Pittakis or Pittakys (1798‚Äì1863) was a Greek archaeologist from Athens. As a youth he fought in the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire, besieging the Ottoman troops in the Acropolis; according to a dubious and probably fictitious anecdote, he is said to have sent bullets to the opposing army, in hopes to save the Parthenon the Ottoman had started to demolish in order to recover the lead clamps which they intended to use for bullets.BERESFORD, J.

After independence, Pittakis became Greece's first General Keeper of Antiquities. From 1837 to 1840, Pittakis supervised the reassembly of the Erechtheion. Though well- intentioned, his ignorance drew criticism from architecture historians and archaeologists. Kyriakos Pittakis campaigned to collect epigraphical material in Athens, gathering inscriptions in the church of Megali Panagia, the Theseum, the Stoa of Hadrian and the Tower of the Winds. Such preservationary efforts have been considered significant contributions to Greek archaeology. He also carried out the first excavations at Mycenae in 1841. He restored the Lion Gate.

It borders the Manchester districts of Levenshulme to the north, the Stockport districts of Heaton Moor to the west, Reddish and Heaton Norris to the east and Heaton Mersey to the west and south. Heaton Chapel and its neighbouring areas are collectively known as the Four Heatons. History St Thomas' Church Before 1758, Heaton Chapel did not exist but was simply part of the Lancashire parish of Heaton Norris.The History of St Thomas', Heaton Norris, pub privately by the author, deposited with The British Library Copyright Receipt Office on 1 August 1979 under receipt 68519, and now released on line http://shawweb.myzen.co.uk/stephen/thomas0.htm The need for a chapel was identified in Parliamentary Commission \\"Lancashire and Cheshire church surveys\\" (1649‚Äì1655) but it was a further hundred years before Mr A. Colier raised money by public subscription and Mr Sidebotham petitioned the bishop of Chester for a license to worship in 1758. It was dedicated 28 October 1758. It is speculated that the need for the chapel was stimulated by the preaching of Charles Wesley who visited Stockport in 1745. The Church was built on a field known as Yarn Croft of 1,712 square yards. The building was plain brick, with three rounded windows on the North side and three on the South side, and a small projecting chancel, which served as a place for the communion table, which was lit by means of a long round-headed window, with two long rectangular windows on each side.The Stockport Advertiser 1874 The church is 'miswent'; that is not built on a true east‚Äìwest axis. In 2015, the Diocese of Manchester changed the official address of the church from Heaton Norris to Heaton Chapel - 250 years after its establishment. The principal road from Manchester to Stockport and the south ran through Heaton Chapel along the line of the present Manchester Road. It was turnpiked in 1724.http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/districts/levenshulme.html Levenshulme:Districts and suburbs of Manchester There was a toll gate opposite the church. It entered Stockport down Lancashire Hill. In 1826 a new turnpike was built.Townships: Heaton Norris', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 4 (1911), pp. 323‚Äì326. with an EMU train In 1837 Parliamentary approval was given for the railway to be built by the Manchester and Birmingham Railway, and the first section from Heaton Norris to Manchester Travis Street opened in 1841, but a viaduct needed to be built at Stockport. The London and North Western Railway completed the Crewe to Manchester Line from Manchester, London Road to Crewe, the rector, Mr Jackson used personal influence, to have a station built in 1851, close to the rectory in Heaton Moor Road. The Station was built in a cutting. There was already a Heaton Norris station (on Georges Road),so the new station was named Heaton Chapel. The subsequent growth of the Heaton Moor area led to a temporary change of the railway station name, Heaton Chapel for Heaton Moor, then Heaton Chapel AND Heaton Moor - but it has again returned to Heaton Chapel. This line was electrified in 1959. A second line passes through Heaton Chapel but there is no station. In the inter-war years there was a tram service along Wellington Road operated jointly by Manchester and Stockport corporation. Stockport used 460v DC and Manchester 400 volts so the Manchester trams would need another resistance in the circuit. The Stockport trams would probably have been able to manage without swapping, they would just be on a slightly lower voltage. The trams stopped at the Levenshulme/ Heaton Chapel border so the resistances could be changed and the collectors manually changed from one set of wires to the others. A number of mansions were built close to the border with Heaton Moor during the early 20th century. This part of Heaton Chapel today has some of the most palatial and expensive housing in Greater Manchester. Though the SK4 postcode which includes Heaton Chapel is together regarded as rich.http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadHome.do?m=0&s;=1378904512622&enc;=1&nsjs;=true&nsck;=false&nssvg;=false&nswid;=1440 Heaton Chapel was in 2018 ranked by The Times best places to live 2018, higher than Didsbury.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-heatons-cheshire-best- places-to-live-fzjlmd2l7 Local economy Heaton Chapel is largely residential, characterised by substantial well detailed early 20th century houses A large biscuit works was opened in 1918 by McVitie and Price, later McVitie's, part of United Biscuits. In this location chocolate covered biscuits such as Penguin biscuits and Jaffa Cakes are manufactured. Crossley Bros. Ltd commenced motor car production in 1906 after several years experience of building engines and by the end of 1916 had already supplied large numbers of tenders to the Royal Flying Corps. In addition, production of Beardmore and Bentley Aero engines was undertaken. Wartime expansion of production had led to the acquisition of premises at High Lane, Heaton Chapel. This subsequently was renamed Crossley Road, and marked the spot where Stockport became Manchester. In 1917 the factory was adapted to produce De Havilland DH.9 single-engined and DH.10 twin-engined bombers. It was known as the National Aircraft Factory No. 2, employed 2,500 people and was managed by Crossley Motors Limited. About 450 DH9s and seven DH10s were completed before production ceased after the Armistice.R.A.Scholefield, \\"Manchester Airport\\", 1998, Sutton Publishing page 35, In 1934 the factory was acquired by Mr (later Sir) Richard Fairey, who wanted additional factory space to produce aircraft ordered under the UK's re-armament programme. Thus Fairey Aviation was based on Crossley Road next to the railway line. The factory manufactured 14 Fairey Hendon, 1,154 Battle, 600 Fulmar and 675 Barracuda aircraft and also reconditioned Swordfishes. Fairey's also built, under sub-contract, over 660 Handley Page Halifaxes and nearly 500 Bristol Beaufighters. Heaton Chapel had design staff and manufacturing capacity. Assembly was at Barton Aerodrome for a short period then at RAF Ringway from June 1937 onwards. History of Fairey Engineering In 1951 the FD1, Fairey Delta 1, was built here. On 10 March 1956, the Fairey Delta 2, with Heaton Chapel components, broke the World Air Speed Record at 1820 km/h (1132 mph). From 1954, the Gannet was also built here although production of the 338 aircraft was shared with the company's other factory at Hayes, Middlesex. In 1946 the company diversified into the Nuclear industry, forming Fairey Stainless. In 1986 Fairey Engineering was taken over by Williams Holdings and became Williams Fairey Engineering Ltd. It is now known as WFEL. The Air Portable Ferry Bridge (APFB) is a lightweight 40 metre bridge that can be transported to site in a C130 aircraft, and erected by 8 engineers in 90 minutes. It is in use in Iraq and Helmand Province, Afghanistan. Fairey Aviation sponsored the Fairey Brass Band, who hold rehearsals in Heaton Chapel. Popular culture Sir John Alcock, who with Arthur Whitten Brown, made the first non-stop transatlantic flight in 1919, was raised in Heaton Chapel and attended St. Thomas' Primary School alongside the church. Heaton Chapel was the home of the Poco-a-Poco Club, many a big name star performed here including David Bowie 27 April 1970. Sited at the junction of Denby Lane and Manchester Road, and formerly, the Empress Cinema, this has now been demolished and has been home to The Hinds Head pub for a number of years.

It is the only vertebrate species endemic to the region. The Norway lemming dwells in tundra and fells, and prefers to live near water. Adults feed primarily on sedges, grasses and moss. They are active at both day and night, alternating naps with periods of activity. Description The Norway lemming has a bold pattern of black and yellow-brown, which is variable between individuals. It grows to a size of 155 mm. The tail is very short (10 ‚Äì 19 mm). It weighs up to 130 g. The dental formula is 1/1, 0/0, 3/3. Behavior The Norway lemming has a dramatic three- to four-year population cycle, in which the species' population periodically rises to unsustainable levels, leading to high mortality, which causes the population to crash again. The Norway lemming spends the winter in nests under the snow. When the spring thaws begin and the snow starts to collapse, they must migrate to higher ground, where the snow is still firm enough for safety, or, more commonly, to lower ground, where they spend the summer months. In autumn, they must time their movement back to sheltered higher ground carefully, leaving after alpine snow cover is available for their burrows and nests, and before the lowlands are made uninhabitable by frost and ice. When the seasons are particularly good (short winters without unexpected thaws or freezes, and long summers), the Norway lemming population can increase exponentially; they reach sexual maturity less than a month after birth, and breed year-round if conditions are right, producing a litter of six to eight young every three to four weeks. Being solitary creatures by nature, the stronger lemmings drive the weaker and younger ones off long before a food shortage occurs. The young lemmings disperse in random directions looking for vacant territory. Where geographical features constrain their movements and channel them into a relatively narrow corridor, large numbers can build up, leading to social friction, distress, and eventually a mass panic can follow, where they flee in all directions. Lemmings do migrate, and in vast numbers sometimes, but notion of a deliberate march into the sea is false. According to genetic research,Fedorov, V.B. & Nils Christian Stenseth (2001). Glacial survival of the Norwegian lemming (Lemmus lemmus) in Scandinavia: inference from mitochondrial DNA variation. Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological Sciences, 268(1469):809-814. the Norwegian lemming survived the Pleistocene glaciation in western Europe, inhabiting various refugia which were not covered by ice. Alternatively, some researchers have contended the Norwegian lemming populations had arisen from ancestors of the present-day brown lemming (Lemmus sibiricus), moving in after glaciers receded. When confronted with a predator, Norway lemmings do not try to run away, attacking the predator or intruder, instead. They have also been known to attack approaching humans. With their colorful body and brave behavior, it has been suggested that they belong to aposematic species.

The company specialized in Macintosh peripherals and accessory equipment. It completed its IPO in 1990. Their products ranged from processor upgrade cards (Radius Accelerator) bringing Motorola 68020 processors to earlier Macintosh systems; graphics accelerators (Radius QuickColor); television tuners (RadiusTV); video capture cards (VideoVision); color calibrators (PrecisionColor); multi-processor systems (Radius Rocket) for 3D rendering and multiple OS sessions; high-end video adapters and monitors. History Radius Thunder IV GX 1600 NuBus graphics accelerator The first Radius product was the Radius Full Page Display, the first large screen available for any personal computer. First available for the Macintosh Plus, it pioneered the concept of putting multiple screens in a single coordinate space, allowing users to drag windows between multiple screens. This was a concept that Apple later incorporated into the Macintosh II. The second Radius product was the Radius Accelerator, an add-on card that quadrupled the speed of the Macintosh by adding a Motorola 68020 processor. Another product was the Pivot Display: a full-page display that rotated between landscape and portrait orientation with real-time remapping of the menus, mouse and screen drawing. The award-winning product design was by Terry Oyama, former ID lead at Apple Computer. By late 1992, the company faced hard times. It faced multiple shareholder lawsuits, accusing senior managers of extensive insider trading weeks before announcing the company's first unprofitable quarter; several failed R&D; projects; a black eye from its bug- ridden Radius Rocket product; and a lack of market focus. In 1993, following the company's first round of layoffs, the strategy was to live off the professional graphics market but build the video business. The company's first acquisition was VideoFusion, as Radius sought a toehold in the world of video production software. The company's engineering management was given the opportunity to partner with or acquire After Effects (originally by CoSA, but acquired by Aldus and later Adobe Systems) but declined. Thus they missed the chance to own a product that would come to define the first decade of digital video. In 1994, Radius acquired rival SuperMac and shifted headquarters into the latter's building. The SuperMac acquisition netted Radius the Cinepak video compression CODEC, which was still supported by most encoders and almost all media players by the early 2000s. The acquisitions continued with Pipeline Digital and its professional time code and video tape deck control software. The advent of Macintosh computers with PCI expansion slots in 1995 saw the end of vendors that made expansion cards exclusively for Macintosh computers. With minor tweaks and new firmware, PC expansion card vendors were able to produce expansion cards for Mac OS computers. With their far greater production volumes from the PC side of the business, vendors such as ATI, Matrox, and others were easily able to undercut the prices of Macintosh-only vendors such as Radius. In March 1995, Radius became the first licensed Macintosh clone vendor, and offered two new products: the Radius System 100 and the Radius 81/110. In its final strategic direction, Radius licensed the brand name \\"SuperMac\\" to Umax in 1996 for its Mac OS clones. In August 1998, the Radius division and its trademark was acquired by miro Displays with the help of its major shareholder, Korea Display Systems (KDS), and was used in their line of CRT and LCD monitors. On Jan. 6, 1999, it changed its name to Digital Origin and returned to making video editing hardware and software, including EditDV,Radius EditDV makes the cut MacWeek, Jan 5, 1998 which was named \\"The Best Video Tool of 1998\\".eMediaweekly Names Radius EditDV \\"The Best VideoTool of 1998\\" Business Wire, Sept 17 1998 In 2002, it was acquired by Media 100.Media 100 to buy Digital Origin  Alumni  * Ed Colligan * Andy Hertzfeld * Burrell Smith References  External links  Defunct computer hardware companies Macintosh clones Companies based in Sunnyvale, California 1986 establishments in California ","title":"Radius (hardware company)"},{"id":"1360069","text":"Clellan Card Clellan Card (June 24, 1903-April 13, 1966) was an on-air personality at the Minnesota Television station WCCO best known for the dozen years when he played Axel Torgeson on the local children's show Axel and His Dog. Card was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and spent most of his life in the Twin Cities region, although he attended Rutgers College in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He dropped out of Rutgers in 1926, moved back with his parents, and worked at various jobs before starting in radio. His first broadcasting job was doing voice work for a fishing tackle commercial.What a Card! The Story of Clellan Card and Axel and His Dog by Julian West, (Edina, Minn.: Beaver's Pond Press, Inc., 2008). He married Marion Satterlee in 1928 and had three boys from their union, Clellan Peter, 1929, John Brooke, 1934, and Michael Satterlee, 1939. The Axel character, a loony \\"Scandihoovian,\\" was created by Card in the late 1930s on a morning radio show on WCCO AM called Almanac of the Air. Card suffered great losses in September, 1952, and January, 1953, when the oldest two of his three children died in separate accidents. His son Peter died in an Air Force training crash in San Angelo, Texas, and John died in an automobile accident in Minneapolis. It is believed by those who knew him well that these events led Card to focus his broadcast talents toward children. Axel and His Dog went on the air the first time on August 5, 1954. Donald Stolz, founder of the Old Log Theater, played Towser, the dog, and soon added Tallulah the cat as well. Local singer and entertainer Mary Davies played Carmen the Nurse. In October 1954, the show was the first local program in the Twin Cities to be broadcast in color, using an experimental system. In January 1959, its rating was nearly three times that of the nearest competitor, American Bandstand. A memorable live event at Excelsior Amusement Park at Lake Minnetonka in 1958 saw an attendance of 12,000. In the early 1960s, Card was diagnosed with lymphoma, though few people outside of WCCO knew of his condition. He continued to do the show as long as possible, but was admitted to Abbott Hospital in April 1966, and died eight days later. Carmen the Nurse went on the air the following day to inform viewers of what happened. A memorial fund was set up, with $5,600 raised in the next two months. Roughly half of the money came in small donations of coins from children.

Generalizations of backpropagation exists for other artificial neural networks (ANNs), and for functions generally. These classes of algorithms are all referred to generically as \\"backpropagation\\"., \\"Furthermore, back-propagation is often misunderstood as being speciÔ¨Åc to multi-layer neural networks, but in principle it can compute derivatives of any function\\" In fitting a neural network, backpropagation computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network for a single input‚Äìoutput example, and does so efficiently, unlike a naive direct computation of the gradient with respect to each weight individually. This efficiency makes it feasible to use gradient methods for training multilayer networks, updating weights to minimize loss; gradient descent, or variants such as stochastic gradient descent, are commonly used. The backpropagation algorithm works by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by the chain rule, computing the gradient one layer at a time, iterating backward from the last layer to avoid redundant calculations of intermediate terms in the chain rule; this is an example of dynamic programming. The term backpropagation strictly refers only to the algorithm for computing the gradient, not how the gradient is used; however, the term is often used loosely to refer to the entire learning algorithm, including how the gradient is used, such as by stochastic gradient descent., \\"The term back- propagation is often misunderstood as meaning the whole learning algorithm for multilayer neural networks. Backpropagation refers only to the method for computing the gradient, while other algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent, is used to perform learning using this gradient.\\" Backpropagation generalizes the gradient computation in the delta rule, which is the single- layer version of backpropagation, and is in turn generalized by automatic differentiation, where backpropagation is a special case of reverse accumulation (or \\"reverse mode\\")., \\"The back-propagation algorithm described here is only one approach to automatic differentiation. It is a special case of a broader class of techniques called reverse mode accumulation.\\" The term backpropagation and its general use in neural networks was announced in , then elaborated and popularized in , but the technique was independently rediscovered many times, and had many predecessors dating to the 1960s; see . A modern overview is given in the deep learning textbook by . Overview Backpropagation computes the gradient in weight space of a feedforward neural network, with respect to a loss function. Denote: * x: input (vector of features) * y: target output *:For classification, output will be a vector of class probabilities (e.g., (0.1, 0.7, 0.2), and target output is a specific class, encoded by the one-hot/dummy variable (e.g., (0, 1, 0)). * C: loss function or \\"cost function\\" *:For classification, this is usually cross entropy (XC, log loss), while for regression it is usually squared error loss (SEL). * L: the number of layers * W^l = (w^l_{jk}): the weights between layer l - 1 and l, where w^l_{jk} is the weight between the k-th node in layer l - 1 and the j-th node in layer l * f^l: activation functions at layer l *:For classification the last layer is usually the logistic function for binary classification, and softmax (softargmax) for multi-class classification, while for the hidden layers this was traditionally a sigmoid function (logistic function or others) on each node (coordinate), but today is more varied, with rectifier (ramp, ReLU) being common. In the derivation of backpropagation, other intermediate quantities are used; they are introduced as needed below. Bias terms are not treated specially, as they correspond to a weight with a fixed input of 1. For the purpose of backpropagation, the specific loss function and activation functions do not matter, as long as they and their derivatives can be evaluated efficiently. The overall network is a combination of function composition and matrix multiplication: :g(x) := f^L(W^L f^{L-1}(W^{L-1} \\\\cdots f^1(W^1 x)\\\\cdots)) For a training set there will be a set of input‚Äìoutput pairs, \\\\left\\\\\\\\{(x_i, y_i)\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. For each input‚Äìoutput pair (x_i, y_i) in the training set, the loss of the model on that pair is the cost of the difference between the predicted output g(x_i) and the target output y_i: :C(y_i, g(x_i)) Note the distinction: during model evaluation, the weights are fixed, while the inputs vary (and the target output may be unknown), and the network ends with the output layer (it does not include the loss function). During model training, the input‚Äìoutput pair is fixed, while the weights vary, and the network ends with the loss function. Backpropagation computes the gradient for a fixed input‚Äìoutput pair (x_i, y_i), where the weights w^l_{jk} can vary. Each individual component of the gradient, \\\\partial C/\\\\partial w^l_{jk}, can be computed by the chain rule; however, doing this separately for each weight is inefficient. Backpropagation efficiently computes the gradient by avoiding duplicate calculations and not computing unnecessary intermediate values, by computing the gradient of each layer ‚Äì specifically, the gradient of the weighted input of each layer, denoted by \\\\delta^l ‚Äì from back to front. Informally, the key point is that since the only way a weight in W^l affects the loss is through its effect on the next layer, and it does so linearly, \\\\delta^l are the only data you need to compute the gradients of the weights at layer l, and then you can compute the previous layer \\\\delta^{l-1} and repeat recursively. This avoids inefficiency in two ways. Firstly, it avoids duplication because when computing the gradient at layer l, you do not need to recompute all the derivatives on later layers l+1, l+2, \\\\ldots each time. Secondly, it avoids unnecessary intermediate calculations because at each stage it directly computes the gradient of the weights with respect to the ultimate output (the loss), rather than unnecessarily computing the derivatives of the values of hidden layers with respect to changes in weights \\\\partial a^{l'}_{j'}/\\\\partial w^l_{jk}. Backpropagation can be expressed for simple feedforward networks in terms of matrix multiplication, or more generally in terms of the adjoint graph. Matrix multiplication For the basic case of a feedforward network, where nodes in each layer are connected only to nodes in the immediate next layer (without skipping any layers), and there is a loss function that computes a scalar loss for the final output, backpropagation can be understood simply by matrix multiplication. Essentially, backpropagation evaluates the expression for the derivative of the cost function as a product of derivatives between each layer from left to right ‚Äì \\"backwards\\" ‚Äì with the gradient of the weights between each layer being a simple modification of the partial products (the \\"backwards propagated error\\"). Given an input‚Äìoutput pair (x, y), the loss is: :C(y, f^L(W^L f^{L-1}(W^{L-1} \\\\cdots f^2(W^2 f^1(W^1 x))\\\\cdots))) To compute this, one starts with the input x and works forward; denote the weighted input of each layer as z^l and the output of layer l as the activation a^l. For backpropagation, the activation a^l as well as the derivatives (f^l)' (evaluated at z^l) must be cached for use during the backwards pass. The derivative of the loss in terms of the inputs is given by the chain rule; note that each term is a total derivative, evaluated at the value of the network (at each node) on the input x: :\\\\frac{d C}{d a^L}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{d a^L}{d z^L}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{d z^L}{d a^{L-1}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{d a^{L-1}}{d z^{L-1}}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{d z^{L-1}}{d a^{L-2}} \\\\cdots \\\\frac{d a^1}{d z^1} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\partial z^1}{\\\\partial x}. These terms are: the derivative of the loss function; the derivatives of the activation functions; and the matrices of weights: :\\\\frac{d C}{d a^L}\\\\cdot (f^L)' \\\\cdot W^L \\\\cdot (f^{L-1})' \\\\cdot W^{L-1} \\\\cdots (f^1)' \\\\cdot W^1. The gradient abla is the transpose of the derivative of the output in terms of the input, so the matrices are transposed and the order of multiplication is reversed, but the entries are the same: : abla_x C = (W^1)^T \\\\cdot (f^1)' \\\\cdots \\\\cdot (W^{L-1})^T \\\\cdot (f^{L-1})' \\\\cdot (W^L)^T \\\\cdot (f^L)' \\\\cdot abla_{a^L} C. Backpropagation then consists essentially of evaluating this expression from right to left (equivalently, multiplying the previous expression for the derivative from left to right), computing the gradient at each layer on the way; there is an added step, because the gradient of the weights isn't just a subexpression: there's an extra multiplication. Introducing the auxiliary quantity \\\\delta^l for the partial products (multiplying from right to left), interpreted as the \\"error at level l\\" and defined as the gradient of the input values at level l: :\\\\delta^l := (f^l)' \\\\cdot (W^{l+1})^T \\\\cdots \\\\cdot (W^{L-1})^T \\\\cdot (f^{L-1})' \\\\cdot (W^L)^T \\\\cdot (f^L)' \\\\cdot abla_{a^L} C. Note that \\\\delta^l is a vector, of length equal to the number of nodes in level l; each term is interpreted as the \\"cost attributable to (the value of) that node\\". The gradient of the weights in layer l is then: : abla_{W^l} C = \\\\delta^l(a^{l-1})^T. The factor of a^{l-1} is because the weights W^l between level l - 1 and l affect level l proportionally to the inputs (activations): the inputs are fixed, the weights vary. The \\\\delta^l can easily be computed recursively as: :\\\\delta^{l-1} := (f^{l-1})' \\\\cdot (W^l)^T \\\\cdot \\\\delta^l. The gradients of the weights can thus be computed using a few matrix multiplications for each level; this is backpropagation. Compared with naively computing forwards (using the \\\\delta^l for illustration): :\\\\begin{align} \\\\delta^1 &= (f^1)' \\\\cdot (W^2)^T \\\\cdot (f^2)' \\\\cdots \\\\cdot (W^{L-1})^T \\\\cdot (f^{L-1})' \\\\cdot (W^L)^T \\\\cdot (f^L)' \\\\cdot abla_{a^L} C\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\delta^2 &= (f^2)' \\\\cdots \\\\cdot (W^{L-1})^T \\\\cdot (f^{L-1})' \\\\cdot (W^L)^T \\\\cdot (f^L)' \\\\cdot abla_{a^L} C\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\delta^{L-1} &= (f^{L-1})' \\\\cdot (W^L)^T \\\\cdot (f^L)' \\\\cdot abla_{a^L} C\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\delta^L &= (f^L)' \\\\cdot abla_{a^L} C, \\\\end{align} there are two key differences with backpropagation: # Computing \\\\delta^{l-1} in terms of \\\\delta^l avoids the obvious duplicate multiplication of layers l and beyond. # Multiplying starting from abla_{a^L} C ‚Äì propagating the error backwards ‚Äì means that each step simply multiplies a vector (\\\\delta^l) by the matrices of weights (W^l)^T and derivatives of activations (f^{l-1})'. By contrast, multiplying forwards, starting from the changes at an earlier layer, means that each multiplication multiplies a matrix by a matrix. This is much more expensive, and corresponds to tracking every possible path of a change in one layer l forward to changes in the layer l+2 (for multiplying W^{l+1} by W^{l+2}, with additional multiplications for the derivatives of the activations), which unnecessarily computes the intermediate quantities of how weight changes affect the values of hidden nodes. Adjoint graph For more general graphs, and other advanced variations, backpropagation can be understood in terms of automatic differentiation, where backpropagation is a special case of reverse accumulation (or \\"reverse mode\\"). Intuition =Motivation= The goal of any supervised learning algorithm is to find a function that best maps a set of inputs to their correct output. The motivation for backpropagation is to train a multi-layered neural network such that it can learn the appropriate internal representations to allow it to learn any arbitrary mapping of input to output. =Learning as an optimization problem= To understand the mathematical derivation of the backpropagation algorithm, it helps to first develop some intuition about the relationship between the actual output of a neuron and the correct output for a particular training example. Consider a simple neural network with two input units, one output unit and no hidden units, and in which each neuron uses a linear output (unlike most work on neural networks, in which mapping from inputs to outputs is non-linear) that is the weighted sum of its input. A simple neural network with two input units (each with a single input) and one output unit (with two inputs) Initially, before training, the weights will be set randomly. Then the neuron learns from training examples, which in this case consist of a set of tuples (x_1, x_2, t) where x_1 and x_2 are the inputs to the network and is the correct output (the output the network should produce given those inputs, when it has been trained). The initial network, given x_1 and x_2, will compute an output that likely differs from (given random weights). A loss function L(t, y) is used for measuring the discrepancy between the target output and the computed output . For regression analysis problems the squared error can be used as a loss function, for classification the categorical crossentropy can be used. As an example consider a regression problem using the square error as a loss: :L(t, y)= (t-y)^2 = E, where is the discrepancy or error. Consider the network on a single training case: (1, 1, 0). Thus, the input x_1 and x_2 are 1 and 1 respectively and the correct output, is 0. Now if the relation is plotted between the network's output on the horizontal axis and the error on the vertical axis, the result is a parabola. The minimum of the parabola corresponds to the output which minimizes the error . For a single training case, the minimum also touches the horizontal axis, which means the error will be zero and the network can produce an output that exactly matches the target output . Therefore, the problem of mapping inputs to outputs can be reduced to an optimization problem of finding a function that will produce the minimal error. Error surface of a linear neuron for a single training case However, the output of a neuron depends on the weighted sum of all its inputs: :y=x_1w_1 + x_2w_2, where w_1 and w_2 are the weights on the connection from the input units to the output unit. Therefore, the error also depends on the incoming weights to the neuron, which is ultimately what needs to be changed in the network to enable learning. If each weight is plotted on a separate horizontal axis and the error on the vertical axis, the result is a parabolic bowl. For a neuron with weights, the same plot would require an elliptic paraboloid of k+1 dimensions. Error surface of a linear neuron with two input weights One commonly used algorithm to find the set of weights that minimizes the error is gradient descent. Backpropagation is then used to calculate the steepest descent direction in an efficient way. Derivation The gradient descent method involves calculating the derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network. This is normally done using backpropagation. Assuming one output neuron, the squared error function is :E = L(t, y) where :E is the loss for the output y and target value t, :t is the target output for a training sample, and :y is the actual output of the output neuron. For each neuron j, its output o_j is defined as :o_j = \\\\varphi(\\\\text{net}_j) = \\\\varphi\\\\left(\\\\sum_{k=1}^n w_{kj}o_k\\\\right), where the activation function \\\\varphi is non-linear and differentiable (even if the ReLU is not in one point). A historically used activation function is the logistic function: : \\\\varphi(z) = \\\\frac 1 {1+e^{-z}} which has a convenient derivative of: : \\\\frac {d \\\\varphi(z)}{d z} = \\\\varphi(z)(1-\\\\varphi(z)) The input \\\\text{net}_j to a neuron is the weighted sum of outputs o_k of previous neurons. If the neuron is in the first layer after the input layer, the o_k of the input layer are simply the inputs x_k to the network. The number of input units to the neuron is n. The variable w_{kj} denotes the weight between neuron k of the previous layer and neuron j of the current layer. =Finding the derivative of the error= Diagram of an artificial neural network to illustrate the notation used here. Calculating the partial derivative of the error with respect to a weight w_{ij} is done using the chain rule twice: = \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial o_{j}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial o_{j}}{\\\\partial w_{ij}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial o_j} \\\\frac{\\\\partial o_j}{\\\\partial\\\\text{net}_j} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\text{net}_j}{\\\\partial w_{ij}}}} In the last factor of the right-hand side of the above, only one term in the sum \\\\text{net}_j depends on w_{ij}, so that = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial w_{ij}} \\\\left(\\\\sum_{k=1}^n w_{kj} o_k\\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial w_{ij}} w_{ij} o_i= o_i.}} If the neuron is in the first layer after the input layer, o_i is just x_i. The derivative of the output of neuron j with respect to its input is simply the partial derivative of the activation function: which for the logistic activation function case is: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial o_j}{\\\\partial\\\\text{net}_j} = \\\\frac {\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\text{net}_j} \\\\varphi(\\\\text{net}_j) = \\\\varphi(\\\\text{net}_j)(1-\\\\varphi(\\\\text{net}_j)) = o_j(1-o_j) This is the reason why backpropagation requires the activation function to be differentiable. (Nevertheless, the ReLU activation function, which is non-differentiable at 0, has become quite popular, e.g. in AlexNet) The first factor is straightforward to evaluate if the neuron is in the output layer, because then o_j = y and If half of the square error is used as loss function we can rewrite it as : \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial o_j} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial y} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y} \\\\frac{1}{2}(t - y)^2 = y - t However, if j is in an arbitrary inner layer of the network, finding the derivative E with respect to o_j is less obvious. Considering E as a function with the inputs being all neurons L = \\\\\\\\{u, v, \\\\dots, w\\\\\\\\} receiving input from neuron j, : \\\\frac{\\\\partial E(o_j)}{\\\\partial o_j} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial E(\\\\mathrm{net}_u, \\\\text{net}_v, \\\\dots, \\\\mathrm{net}_w)}{\\\\partial o_j} and taking the total derivative with respect to o_j, a recursive expression for the derivative is obtained: Therefore, the derivative with respect to o_j can be calculated if all the derivatives with respect to the outputs o_\\\\ell of the next layer ‚Äì the ones closer to the output neuron ‚Äì are known. [Note, if any of the neurons in set L were not connected to neuron j, they would be independent of w_{ij} and the corresponding partial derivative under the summation would vanish to 0.] Substituting , and in we obtain: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial w_{ij}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial o_{j}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial o_{j}}{\\\\partial \\\\text{net}_{j}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\text{net}_{j}}{\\\\partial w_{ij}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial o_{j}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial o_{j}}{\\\\partial \\\\text{net}_{j}} o_i : \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial w_{ij}} = o_i \\\\delta_j with :\\\\delta_j = \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial o_j} \\\\frac{\\\\partial o_j}{\\\\partial\\\\text{net}_j} = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{\\\\partial L(o_j, t)}{\\\\partial o_j} \\\\frac {d \\\\varphi(\\\\text{net}_j)}{d \\\\text{net}_j} & \\\\text{if } j \\\\text{ is an output neuron,}\\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\sum_{\\\\ell\\\\in L} w_{j \\\\ell} \\\\delta_\\\\ell)\\\\frac {d \\\\varphi(\\\\text{net}_j)}{d \\\\text{net}_j} & \\\\text{if } j \\\\text{ is an inner neuron.} \\\\end{cases} if \\\\varphi is the logistic function, and the error is the square error: : \\\\delta_j = \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial o_j} \\\\frac{\\\\partial o_j}{\\\\partial\\\\text{net}_j} = \\\\begin{cases} (o_j-t_j)o_j(1-o_{j}) & \\\\text{if } j \\\\text{ is an output neuron,}\\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\sum_{\\\\ell\\\\in L} w_{j \\\\ell} \\\\delta_\\\\ell)o_j(1-o_j) & \\\\text{if } j \\\\text{ is an inner neuron.} \\\\end{cases} To update the weight w_{ij} using gradient descent, one must choose a learning rate, \\\\eta >0. The change in weight needs to reflect the impact on E of an increase or decrease in w_{ij}. If \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial w_{ij}} > 0, an increase in w_{ij} increases E; conversely, if \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial w_{ij}} < 0, an increase in w_{ij} decreases E. The new \\\\Delta w_{ij} is added to the old weight, and the product of the learning rate and the gradient, multiplied by -1 guarantees that w_{ij} changes in a way that always decreases E. In other words, in the equation immediately below,  \\\\eta \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial w_{ij}} always changes w_{ij} in such a way that E is decreased: : \\\\Delta w_{ij} = - \\\\eta \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial w_{ij}} = - \\\\eta o_i \\\\delta_j Loss function The loss function is a function that maps values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some \\"cost\\" associated with those values. For backpropagation, the loss function calculates the difference between the network output and its expected output, after a training example has propagated through the network. =Assumptions= The mathematical expression of the loss function must fulfill two conditions in order for it to be possibly used in backpropagation., \\"[W]hat assumptions do we need to make about our cost function ... in order that backpropagation can be applied? The first assumption we need is that the cost function can be written as an average ... over cost functions ... for individual training examples ... The second assumption we make about the cost is that it can be written as a function of the outputs from the neural network ...\\" The first is that it can be written as an average E=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_xE_x over error functions E_x, for n individual training examples, x. The reason for this assumption is that the backpropagation algorithm calculates the gradient of the error function for a single training example, which needs to be generalized to the overall error function. The second assumption is that it can be written as a function of the outputs from the neural network. =Example loss function= Let y,y' be vectors in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. Select an error function E(y,y') measuring the difference between two outputs. The standard choice is the square of the Euclidean distance between the vectors y and y':E(y,y') = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\lVert y-y'\\\\rVert^2The error function over n training examples can then be written as an average of losses over individual examples:E=\\\\frac{1}{2n}\\\\sum_x\\\\lVert (y(x)-y'(x)) \\\\rVert^2 Limitations Gradient descent may find a local minimum instead of the global minimum. * Gradient descent with backpropagation is not guaranteed to find the global minimum of the error function, but only a local minimum; also, it has trouble crossing plateaus in the error function landscape. This issue, caused by the non-convexity of error functions in neural networks, was long thought to be a major drawback, but Yann LeCun et al. argue that in many practical problems, it is not. * Backpropagation learning does not require normalization of input vectors; however, normalization could improve performance. * Backpropagation requires the derivatives of activation functions to be known at network design time. History The term backpropagation and its general use in neural networks was announced in , then elaborated and popularized in , but the technique was independently rediscovered many times, and had many predecessors dating to the 1960s., \\"Efficient applications of the chain rule based on dynamic programming began to appear in the 1960s and 1970s, mostly for control applications (Kelley, 1960; Bryson and Denham, 1961; Dreyfus, 1962; Bryson and Ho, 1969; Dreyfus, 1973) but also for sensitivity analysis (Linnainmaa, 1976). ... The idea was finally developed in practice after being independently rediscovered in different ways (LeCun, 1985; Parker, 1985; Rumelhart et al., 1986a). The book Parallel Distributed Processing presented the results of some of the first successful experiments with back-propagation in a chapter (Rumelhart et al., 1986b) that contributed greatly to the popularization of back-propagation and initiated a very active period of research in multilayer neural networks.\\" The basics of continuous backpropagation were derived in the context of control theory by Henry J. Kelley in 1960, and by Arthur E. Bryson in 1961. They used principles of dynamic programming. In 1962, Stuart Dreyfus published a simpler derivation based only on the chain rule. Bryson and Ho described it as a multi-stage dynamic system optimization method in 1969. Backpropagation was derived by multiple researchers in the early 60's and implemented to run on computers as early as 1970 by Seppo Linnainmaa. Paul Werbos was first in the US to propose that it could be used for neural nets after analyzing it in depth in his 1974 dissertation.The thesis, and some supplementary information, can be found in his book, While not applied to neural networks, in 1970 Linnainmaa published the general method for automatic differentiation (AD).Seppo Linnainmaa (1970). The representation of the cumulative rounding error of an algorithm as a Taylor expansion of the local rounding errors. Master's Thesis (in Finnish), Univ. Helsinki, 6‚Äì7. Although very controversial, some scientists believe this was actually the first step toward developing a back-propagation algorithm. In 1973 Dreyfus adapts parameters of controllers in proportion to error gradients. In 1974 Werbos mentioned the possibility of applying this principle to artificial neural networks, and in 1982 he applied Linnainmaa's AD method to non-linear functions. Later Werbos method was rediscovered and described 1985 by Parker, and in 1986 by Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams. Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams showed experimentally that this method can generate useful internal representations of incoming data in hidden layers of neural networks. Yann LeCun, inventor of the Convolutional Neural Network architecture, proposed the modern form of the back-propagation learning algorithm for neural networks in his PhD thesis in 1987. In 1993, Eric Wan won an international pattern recognition contest through backpropagation. During the 2000s it fell out of favour, but returned in the 2010s, benefitting from cheap, powerful GPU-based computing systems. This has been especially so in speech recognition, machine vision, natural language processing, and language structure learning research (in which it has been used to explain a variety of phenomena related to first and second language learning.). Error backpropagation has been suggested to explain human brain ERP components like the N400 and P600.

May, The Hapsburg Monarchy, 1867‚Äì1914 (New York: W. W. Norton, 1968), 73. Contemporaries spelled the name \\"Straussmeyer\\". 4 February 1815 - 8 April 1905) was a Croatian politician, Roman Catholic bishop, and benefactor. Early life and rise as a cleric Josip Juraj Strossmayer at younger age Strossmayer was born in Osijek to a Croatian family. His great-grandfather was an ethnic German immigrant from Styria who had married a Croatian woman. He finished a gymnasium in Osijek, graduated theology at the Catholic seminary in ƒêakovo, and earned a PhD in philosophy at a high seminary in Budapest, at the age of 20. In 1838 he worked as a vicar in Petrovaradin, before moving to Vienna in 1840 to the Augustineum and the University of Vienna, where he received another doctorate in philosophy and Canon law in 1842. In 1847 he was made the Habsburg palace chaplain (a position he would hold until 1859), and named one of the rectors of the Augustineum. On 18 November 1849 he was made the bishop of Bosnia and Syrmia with seat in ƒêakovo. The proclamation was made by emperor Franz Joseph and at the proposal of Croatian ban Josip Jelaƒçiƒá. Pope Pius IX confirmed the imperial decree on 20 May 1850. He was made a bishop on 8 September 1850, and officially instated in ƒêakovo on 29 September the same year. Upon installment as bishop, he declared his motto to be Everything for the faith and the homeland. Strossmayer inherited a wealthy diocese: it had 70,000 acres (280 km¬≤) of mixed forests, pastures, arable land and vineyards, with developed cattle and horse breeding facilities, and it generated a yearly income of 150,000 to 300,000 forints. Croatian politics In 1860 he became the leader of the People's Party and remained at its head until 1873. He had previously befriended J√°n Koll√°r in Pest and worked with Czech politicians Franti≈°ek Palack√Ω and Franti≈°ek Rieger on their common ideals of cultural and political association of the Slavic peoples. He strove to obtain more rights for the Slavs within the Monarchy. He advocated federalization, merging of the kingdoms of Dalmatia and Croatia, as well as the introduction of Croatian language into public administration and schools. In 1861, Strossmayer made an influential speech in front of the Croatian Parliament regarding the relations of Croatia and Hungary, where he stated federalization as a goal, and advocated the merging of Meƒëimurje and Rijeka with Croatia. In 1866, the Parliament elected him the president of the Croatian regnikolar deputation (regnikolarna, that which represents the people of the kingdom), a committee that was to negotiate terms of statehood with Hungary, but which failed to successfully make a deal. Instead, the Croatian-Hungarian Settlement of 1868 was passed which was less favorably inclined towards the Croatian cause -- and which Strossmayer protested with respect to decreased autonomy in the areas of budget and finances. In 1872 the Parliament formed another regnikolar deputation for the revision of the Settlement, and Strossmayer was its member, but they again failed in their task. This made Strossmayer retire from active political life and from the leadership of the People's Party. He later sided with the Independent People's Party which was in the opposition and which protested the rule of ban Khuen Hedervary (1883‚Äì1903), and insisted on the merger of all Croatian lands under the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1888 he retired from public politics after the Emperor had rebuked him for favoring the Russians and opposing the Hungarians. Cultural policy Strossmayer was instrumental in the founding of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1866, as well as the re-establishment of the University of Zagreb in 1874. He initiated the building of the Academy Palace (completed in 1880) and set up The Strossmayer Gallery of Old Masters (1884) in Zagreb. Strossmayer aided the creation of the printing house in Cetinje, helped found the Matica slovenska and actively supported Matica srpska, the national culture societies of the Slovenes and the Serbs, respectively. In 1861 he had the book Bulgarian Folk Songs by the Miladinov Brothers from Macedonia printed in Zagreb. He also had several Glagolitic missals printed in the spirit of restoring the Slavonic liturgy that connected the two Christian religions of the South Slavs, and revering the work of saints Cyril and Methodius. Josip Juraj Strossmayer Catholic diplomacy Strossmayer supported the union of all south Slavic peoples, and promoted religious unification through the use of the Slavonic rite both in the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. He served as the papal nuncio for Serbia and visited that country seven times between 1852 and 1886, and he also helped establish the concordat between the Holy See and the state of Montenegro in 1866. In 1869 and 1870 he attended the First Vatican Council in Rome. He made his mark as one of the vocal opponents of the unlimited power of the Pope as well as the doctrine of papal infallibility. He made a speech, completely in Latin, in which he defended protestantism, and which \\"called forth a storm of indignation from the majority, which finally forced the speaker to leave the tribune.\\" Another speech is a forgery which is falsely attributed to him; in this forged speech it is written against the dogma of Papal infallibility: \\"Ah ! if He who reigns above wishes to punish us, making His hand fall heavy on us, as He did on Pharaoh, He has no need to permit Garibaldi's soldiers to drive us away from the eternal city. He has only to let them make Pius IX. a god, as we have made a goddess of the blessed Virgin.\\" He later yielded on the issue of infallibility, and he also headed the Slavic deputations to Rome in 1881 and 1888 which succeeded in convincing Pope Leo XIII to allow the south Slavs of Croatia and Dalmatia to retain Slavonic in the Roman Rite liturgy as well as in the Byzantine Rite. Personal life Since the early days of his episcopate, he was a close friend of Franjo Raƒçki, the most renowned Croatian historian of his time. When the Academy was founded in 1867, Strossmayer was named chief sponsor, and Raƒçki its President. In 1894, when Raƒçki died, Strossmayer wrote: I lost my dearest friend... I lost a part of myself... the good half of everything I have created was his thought, his credit and his glory. Their friendship was well documented in a series of four books containing their letters, compiled by historian Ferdo ≈†i≈°iƒá. Josip Juraj Strossmayer died in ƒêakovo at the age of 90. Legacy Strossmayer monument in Zagreb by Ivan Me≈°troviƒá Strossmayer continuously used the money obtained from his diocese to fund the building of schools, galleries and churches, notably the ornamental Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul in ƒêakovo whose building he oversaw between 1866 and 1882, and which he dedicated to the glory of God, unity of the churches, concord and love of his people. The cathedral of ƒêakovo was the most grandiose object built by Strossmayer during his 55 years as a bishop: he also opened the printing house in ƒêakovo, the boys' seminary in Osijek, supported the main theological seminary and the arrival of nuns in ƒêakovo to help the female youth and caritative efforts, established new parishes throughout the diocese, organized missions for the laity, and finally wrote hundreds if not thousands of pastoral letters sent to the diocese as well as to other parts of Croatia, and elsewhere. Strossmayer is credited with monetary and organizational support for a wide variety of public works in Croatia: schools, gymnasiums, public libraries, helping the poor in remote areas, even building roads, and donating building material for St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. The university of the city of Osijek is named after him, and a large statue of Strossmayer is located in the park that the Academy building overlooks. The city of ƒêakovo built him a memorial museum in 1991. One of the main streets in Sarajevo carries his name. A monument in the Sofia district of Ilinden commemorates Strossmayer's contribution to Bulgarian culture. Also, an important square in Prague is named after him. Bishop Nikolaj Velimiroviƒá dedicated a booklet entitled Religion and Nationality in Serbia to Strossmayer: ‚Äúto the memory of the great Croatian patriot Bishop Strossmayer on the centenary of his birth (1815‚Äì1915)\\".

The village has a population (2019) of 581 and a population density of . History =Telav√•g tragedy= During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, Telav√•g played an important role in the secret North Sea boat traffic between Norway and Great Britain. The village was the scene of the Telav√•g Tragedy in the spring of 1942, during World War II. On 26 April 1942, after having discovered that some of the inhabitants of Telav√•g were hiding two men from the Linge company, Arne Meldal V√¶rum and Emil Gustav Hvaal, the Gestapo arrived to arrest the Norwegian officers. Shots were exchanged, and two prominent German Gestapo officers (Kriminalrat Gerhard Berns and Kriminalsekret√§r Henry Bertram) were shot dead. Arne V√¶rum was also killed in the incident. Emil Hvaal and his son were executed a few months later. Reichskommissar Josef Terboven personally oversaw the Nazi reprisal, which was quick and brutal. 30 April, as the villagers were watching, all buildings were destroyed, all boats were sunk or confiscated, and all livestock taken away. All men in the village were either executed or sent to the Nazi concentration camp at Sachsenhausen. Of the 72 who were deported from Telav√•g, 31 were murdered in captivity. Women and children were imprisoned for two years. 18 Norwegian prisoners (unrelated to Telav√•g) held at the Trandum internment camp were also executed as a reprisal. Though smaller in scale, this atrocity is often compared to similar events at Lidice in the Czech Republic and Oradour-sur-Glane in France.

It lived in what is now North America. Its name means \\"helmet lizard\\", derived from Greek Œ∫œåœÅœÖœÇ. It was named and described in 1914 by Barnum Brown. Corythosaurus is now thought to be a lambeosaurine, related to Nipponosaurus, Velafrons, Hypacrosaurus, and Olorotitan. Corythosaurus has an estimated length of , and has a skull, including the crest, that is tall. Corythosaurus is known from many complete specimens, including the nearly complete holotype found by Brown in 1911. The holotype skeleton is only missing the last section of the tail, and part of the forelimbs, but was preserved with impressions of polygonal scales. Corythosaurus is known from many skulls with tall crests. The crests resemble the crests of the cassowary and a Corinthian helmet. The most likely function of the crest is thought to be vocalization. As in a trombone, sound waves would travel through many chambers in the crest, and then get amplified when Corythosaurus exhaled. A Corythosaurus specimen has been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits: Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these. The two species of Corythosaurus are both present in slightly different levels of the Dinosaur Park Formation. Both still co-existed with theropods and other ornithischians, like Daspletosaurus, Brachylophosaurus, Parasaurolophus, Scolosaurus, and Chasmosaurus. Discovery and species Fossil holotype specimen AMNH 5240 partially covered in skin impressions The first specimen, AMNH 5240, was discovered in 1911 by Barnum Brown in Red Deer River, Alberta, Canada, and secured by him in the Fall of 1912.Lowell Dingus and Mark Norell, 2011 Barnum Brown: The Man Who Discovered Tyrannosaurus rex, University of California Press, p. 143 As well as an almost complete skeleton, the find was notable because impressions of much of the creature's skin had also survived. The specimen came from the Belly River Group of the province. The left or underside of the skeleton was preserved in carbonaceous clay, making it difficult to expose the skin. The skeleton was articulated, and only missing about the last of the tail and the forelimbs. Both scapulae and coracoids are preserved in position, but the rest of the forelimbs are gone, except for phalanges and pieces of humeri, ulnae and radii. Apparently the remaining forelimbs were weathered or eroded away. Impressions of the integument were preserved covering over a large part of the skeletons outlining, and shows the form of the body. Another specimen, AMNH 5338, was found in 1914 by Brown and Peter Kaisen. Both specimens are now housed in the American Museum of Natural History in their original death poses. Excavation of the holotype specimen of C. casuarius by the Red Deer River The type species Corythosaurus casuarius was named by Barnum Brown in 1914, based on the first specimen collected by him in 1912. AMNH 5240 is thus the holotype. In 1916, the original author, Brown, published a more detailed description which was also based on AMNH 5338, which specimen is therefore the plesiotype. Corythosaurus is among many lambeosaurines that possess crests, and it was the crest that lends Corythosaurus its name. The generic name Corythosaurus is derived from Greek Œ∫œåœÅœÖŒ∏ŒøœÇ, korythos, \\"Corinthian helmet\\", and means \\"helmeted lizard\\". The specific name casuarius refers to the cassowary, a bird with a similar skull crest. The full binomial of Corythosaurus casuarius thus means \\"Cassowary-like reptile, with a Corinthian helmet crest\\". Quarry with one of the specimens lost at sea in 1916 The two best preserved specimens of Corythosaurus found, by Charles H. Sternberg in 1912, were lost on 6 December 1916 while being carried by the SS Mount Temple to the United Kingdom, during World War One. They were being sent to Arthur Smith Woodward, a paleontologist of the British Museum of Natural History in England, when the ship transporting them was sunk by the German merchant raider in the middle of the ocean.p. 495 in Tanke, D.H. & Carpenter, K. (2001). There were formerly up to seven species described, including C. casuarius, C. bicristatus Parks 1935, C. brevicristatus Parks 1935, C. excavatus Gilmore 1923, C. frontalis Parks 1935, and C. intermedius Parks 1923. In 1975 Peter Dodson studied the differences between the skulls and crests of different species of lambeosaurine dinosaurs. He found that the differences in size and shape may have actually been related to the gender and age of the animal. Now only one species is recognized for certain, C. casuarius, although C. intermedius has been recognized as valid in some studies. It is based on specimen ROM 776, a skull found by Levi Sternberg in 1920 and was named by William Parks in 1923, who had originally named it Stephanosaurus intermedius earlier that year. The specific name of C. intermedius is derived from its apparent intermediate position according to Parks. C. intermedius lived at a slightly later time in the Campanian than C. casuarius, and the two species are not identical, which supported the separation of them in a 2009 study. Description =Size= Size of the two species compared to a human. Benson et al. (2012) estimated that Corythosaurus has an average length of . Richard Swann Lull's earlier length estimate, published in 1942, found a slightly longer total length of , a size similar to Lambeosaurus lambei, another Canadian lambeosaurine. In 1962, Edwin H. Colbert used models of specific dinosaurs, including Corythosaurus, to estimate their weight. The Corythosaurus model used, was modelled by Vincent Fusco after a mounted skeleton, and supervised by Barnum Brown. After testing, it was concluded that the average weight of Corythosaurus was . More recent size estimates of Corythosaurus, published in 2001, find the genus to be among the largest hadrosaurids, only smaller than Shantungosaurus and Parasaurolophus. The total length of Corythosaurus specimen AMNH 5240 was found to be , with a weight of . Proportionally, the skull is much shorter and smaller than that of Edmontosaurus (formerly Trachodon), Kritosaurus, or Saurolophus, but when including its crest, its superficial area is almost as large. =Skull= ROM 845, mounted skeleton of Corythosaurus cf. intermedius cf. excavatus Parks 1935 at the Royal Ontario Museum Over twenty skulls have been found from this dinosaur. As with other lambeosaurines, the animal bore a tall, elaborate bony crest atop its skull, which contained the elongate narial passages. The narial passages extended into the crest, first into separate pockets in the sides, then into a single central chamber and onward into the respiratory system. The skull of the type specimen has no dermal impressions on it. During preservation it was compressed laterally, so now the width is about two-thirds what it would have been in real life. According to Brown, the compression also caused the nasals to shift where they pressed down on the premaxillaries. Because they were pressed on the premaxillaries, the nasals would have closed the nares. Apart from the compression, the skull appears to be normal. Contrary to what Brown assumed, the areas concerned were fully part of the praemaxillae. The crests of Corythosaurus resemble that of a cassowary, or a Corinthian helmet. They are formed by a combination of the praemaxillae, nasals, prefrontals and frontals, as in Saurolophus, but instead of projecting backwards as a spine, they rise up to make the highest point above the orbit. The two halves of the crest are separated by a median suture. In front of the orbit, the crest is made of thick bone. Skull of the type specimen The nasals make up most of the crest. Brown assumed that they extended from the beaks' tip to the highest spot along the crest and that, unlike those in other genera, the nasals meet in the centre and are not separated in front by an ascending premaxillary process. Brown however, mistook the praemaxillae for the nasals; the snout is actually largely formed by them and they do separate the nasals. Brown also thought that on the top and back of the crest, the whole external face is covered by the frontals. Again he made a mistake: what he assumed to be the frontals are in fact the nasals. The nasals end at the back of the squamosals in a hooked, short process. The prefrontals also make up part of the crest; however, Brown mistook the lower upper branch of the praemaxilla for the prefrontal. The actual prefrontal, triangular in shape, is located at the side of the crest base; it was by Brown seen as a part of the frontal. The real frontals, largely internal to the crest base structure, are not visible from the side.Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., Osm√≥lska, H., & Hilton, Richard P., 2004, The Dinosauria. University of California Press. p. 450 The mouth of the holotype of Corythosaurus is narrow. The praemaxillae each form two long folds. The folds enclose air passages extending the narial passages to the front of the snout. There they end in narrow openings, sometimes called \\"pseudonares\\", false bony nostrils. These were mistaken by Brown for the real nares or nostrils. These are actually situated inside the crest, above the eye sockets. As in Saurolophus, the expanded portion of the premaxillary in front of the pseudonaris' opening is elongate: by comparison, in Kritosaurus, the bill is short, and the pseudonares extend far forward. At the end of the Corythosaurus bill, the two pseudonares unite into one. Because of his incorrect identification, Brown assumed that the holotype's inferior process of the premaxillary was shorter than in Kritosaurus and Saurolophus, and that the process does not unite with the lacrimal, another difference from those genera. The praemaxilla actually does touch the lacrimal and extends to the rear until well behind the eye socket. The lower jaw of the holotype is long, and deep. The total length of the crest from the beak to the uppermost tip of the type specimen is , its total length is , and height . =Soft tissue= Abdominal skin impressions from Brown (1916) In the holotype of C. casuarius, the sides and tail of the body are covered in scales of several types. Polygonal tuberculate scales, covered in small bumps, vary in size over the body. Conical limpet-like scales are only preserved on a fold of skin preserved on the back of the tibia, but which was probably from the bottom of the belly, rather than the leg. Separating the polygonal scales of C. casuarius are shieldlike scales, arranged close together in rows. Ossified tendons are present on all the vertebrae, except for those in the cervical region. On no vertebrae do the tendons extend below the transverse processes. Each tendon is flattened at its origin, and transversely ovoid in the central rod, ending at a rounded point. Aside from those found on Corythosaurus casuarius, extensive skin impressions have been found on Edmontosaurus annectens and notable integument has also been found on Brachylophosaurus canadensis, Gryposaurus notabilis, Parasaurolophus walkeri, Lambeosaurus magnicristatus, L. lambei, Saurolophus angustirsotris and on unidentified ornithopods. Of these, L. lambei, C. casuarius, G. notabilis, P. walkeri, and S. angustirsotris have preserved polygonal scales. The scales on L. lambei, S. angustirostris and C. casuarius are all similar. Corythosaurus is one of very few hadrosaurids which have preserved skin impressions on the hind limbs and feet. A study in 2013 showed that amongst hadrosaurids, Saurolophus angustirostris preserved the best and most complete foot and limb integument, although other species like S. osborni, Edmontosaurus annectens and Lambeosaurus lambei (= L. clavinitialis) share a fair amount of preserved tissue on those regions. It was once thought that this dinosaur lived mostly in the water, due to the appearance of webbed hands and feet. However, it was later discovered that the so-called \\"webs\\" were in fact deflated padding, much like that found on many modern mammals. =Distinguishing characteristics= Skeleton at AMNH A set of characters were indicated by Barnum Brown in 1914 to distinguish Corythosaurus from all other hadrosaurids from Alberta: a comparatively short skull with a high helmet-like crest formed by the nasals, prefrontals and frontals; the nasals not being separated in front by the premaxillaries; a narrow beak, with an expansion in front of an elongated naris; and a small narial opening. In 1916, Brown expanded the character set to include more features; in the revised version: a comparatively short skull with a high helmet-like crest formed by nasals, prefrontals and frontals; the nasals not being separated in front by premaxillaries; a narrow beak, expanded section in front of the elongated nares; a small narial opening; a vertebral formula of 15 cervicals, 19 dorsals, 8 sacrals, and 61+ caudals; possession of dorsal spines of a medium height; high anterior caudal spines; long chevrons; long scapulae, possessing a blade of medium width; a radius considerably longer than humerus; comparatively short metacarpals; an anteriorly decurved ilium; a long ischium with a foot-like terminal expansion; a pubis with an anterior blade that is short and broadly expanded at end; a femur that is longer than the tibia; the phalanges of pes are short; that the integument over the sides and tail composed of polygonal tuberculate scales without pattern but graded in size in different parts of the body; and a belly with longitudinal rows of large conical limpet-like scales separated by uniformly large polygonal tubercles. Again, the presumed traits of the snout are incorrect because Brown confused the praemaxillae with the nasal bones and the nasal bones with the frontals. Most of the postcranial traits are today known to be shared with other lambeosaurines. Classification ROM 870, the skull of a subadult, originally named as a separate species, C. brevicristatus Originally, Brown referred to Corythosaurus as a member of the family Trachodontidae (now Hadrosauridae). Inside Trachodontidae were the subfamilies Trachodontinae and Saurolophinae. Brown classified Hadrosaurus, Trachodon, Claosaurus, and Kritosaurus in Trachodontinae, and Corythosaurus, Stephanosaurus, and Saurolophus in Saurolophinae. Later, Brown revised the phylogeny of Corythosaurus, and found that it was closely related, and possibly ancestral to Hypacrosaurus. The only differences he found between them were the development of the vertebrae, and the proportions of the limbs. During a study of dinosaurian ilia in the 1920s, Alfred Sherwood Romer proposed that the two orders of dinosaurs might have evolved separately, and that birds, based on the shape and proportions of their ilia might truly be specialized ornithischians. He used both Tyrannosaurus and Corythosaurus as a base model to analyze which theory is more likely true. He found that even though birds are thought of as saurischians, it is very plausible for them to have evolved their specific pelvic musculature and anatomy if they evolved from ornithschians like Corythosaurus. However, even though the pelvic structure of Corythosaurus and other Ornithischians does bear a greater superficial resemblance to birds than the Saurischian pelvis does, birds are now known to be highly derived Maniraptoran theropods. Corythosaurus is currently classified as a hadrosaurid, in the subfamily Lambeosaurinae. It is related to other hadrosaurs such as Hypacrosaurus, Lambeosaurus and Olorotitan, with the exception of Olorotitan they all share similar looking skulls and crests. However, research published in 2003 has suggested that even though it possesses a unique crest, Olorotitan is Corythosaurus closest known relative. Benson et al. (2012) found that Corythosaurus was closely related to Velafrons, Nipponosaurus, and Hypacrosaurus, and said that they formed a group of fan-crested lambeosaurines. In 2014, a study including the description of Zhanghenglong was published in the journal PLOS ONE. The study included an almost complete cladogram of hadrosauroid relationships, including Corythosaurus as the most derived lambeosaurine, as sister taxon to Hypacrosaurus. The below cladogram is a simplified version including only Lambeosaurini. Mounted skeleton at the Academy of Natural Science, Drexel University, Philadelphia Paleobiology Comparisons between the scleral rings of Corythosaurus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals. The sense of hearing in hadrosaurids, specifically such as Lophorhothon, also seems to have been greatly developed because of an elongated lagena. The presence of a thin stapes (an ear bone that is rod-like in reptiles), combined with a large eardrum implies the existence of a sensitive middle ear. It is possible that hadrosaurid ears are sensitive enough to detect as much sound as a modern crocodilian. =Crest function= Outdated 1916 restoration showing C. casuarius as semi-aquatic The internal structures of the crest of Corythosaurus are quite complex, making possible a call that could be used for warning or attracting a mate. Nasal passageways of Corythosaurus, as well as Hypacrosaurus and Lambeosaurus are S-shaped, with Parasaurolophus only possessing U-shaped tubes. Any vocalization would travel through these elaborate chambers, and probably get amplified. Scientists speculate that Corythosaurus could make loud, low pitched cries \\"like a wind or brass instrument\\", such as a trombone. The sounds could serve to alert other Corythosaurus to the presence of food or a potential threat from a predator. The nasal passages emit low-frequency sounds when Corythosaurus exhaled. The individual crests would produce different sounds, so it is likely that each species of lambeosaurine would have had a unique sound. However, even though the range for different lambeosaurine nasal passages vary, they all probably made low-pitched sounds. This might be because low sounds (below 400 Hz) travel a set distance in any environment, while higher (above 400 Hz) sounds have a larger spread in the distance travelled. When they were first described, crested hadrosaurs were thought to be aquatic, an assessment based incorrectly on webbing that is now known to be padding. The theory was that the animals could swim deep in the water, and use the crest to store air to breath. However, it has now been proven that the crest did not have any holes in the end, and the water pressure at even would be too great for the lungs to be able to inflate.p. 35 in Norrell, M. et al. (2000). =Growth= ROM 759, a juvenile skull, originally named as a separate species, Tetragonosaurus erectofrons Corythosaurus casuarius is one of a few lambeosaurines, along with Lambeosaurus lambei, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri and H. altispinus, to have had surviving fossilized juveniles assigned to it. Juveniles are harder to assign to species, because at a young age they lack the distinctive larger crests of adults. As they age, lambeosaurine crests tend to grow and become more prominent come maturity. In the Dinosaur Park Formation, over fifty articulated specimens have been found, coming from many different genera. Among them, juveniles are hard to identify at the species level. Earlier, four genera and thirteen species were recognized from the formation's area, when paleontologists used differences in size and crest shape to differentiate taxa. The smallest specimens were identified as Tetragonosaurus, now seen as a synonym of Procheneosaurus, and the largest skeletons were called either Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus; an adult was identified as Parasaurolophus. Small lambeosaurines from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation were referred to Cheneosaurus. Skull growth of Parasaurolophus sp., Corythosaurus casuarius and Casuarius sp. The stars represent the age at which crest development starts Corythosaurus started developing its crest when half the size of adults, but Parasaurolophus juveniles grew crests when only 25% as long as adults. Juvenile Corythosaurus, along with adults, had a premaxilla-nasal fontanelle. Young and adult Corythosaurus are similar to Lambeosaurus and Hypacrosaurus but dissimilar to Parasaurolophus in that the sutures of the skull are sinuous, and not smooth and straight. This feature helps differentiate parasaurolophins from lambeosaurins. Generally, the crests of juveniles of lambeosaurines like Corythosaurus, Lambeosaurus, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri, parasaurolophines like Parasaurolophus, and primitive lambeosaurines like Kazaklambia are quite alike, although other features can be used to distinguish them. Work by Dodson (1975) recognized that there were many less taxa present in Alberta. Tetragonosaurus was found to be juveniles of Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus. T. erectofrons was assigned to Corythosaurus based largely on biometric information. The only non-typic specimen of Tetragonosaurus, assigned to T. erectofrons, was found later to be referable to Hypacrosaurus, although the holotype of the species was still found to be assignable to Corythosaurus. =Diet= Corythosaurus was an ornithopod, and therefore a herbivore. Benson et al. (2012) realized that the beak of Corythosaurus was shallow and delicate, and concluded that it must have been used to feed upon soft vegetation. Based on the climate of the Late Cretaceous, they guessed that Corythosaurus would have been a selective feeder, eating only the juiciest fruits and youngest leaves. Corythosaurus specimens have been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits, meaning that Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these. Paleoecology Skeleton from Dinosaur Provincial Park Fossils have been found in the upper Oldman Formation and lower Dinosaur Park Formation of Canada. The Oldman Formation dates to the Campanian, about 77.5 to 76.5 million years ago, and the Dinosaur Park Formation dates from 76.6 to 74.8 million years ago. Corythosaurus lived from ~77‚Äì75.7 million years ago. In the Dinosaur Park Formation C. casuarius lived from 76.6 to 75.9 mya, with C. intermedius living from 75.8 to 75.7 mya. In the Oldman Formation C. casuarius, the only species of Corythosaurus from the deposits, lived about 77 to 76.5 mya. The holotype specimen was clearly a carcass that had floated up on a beach, as Unio shells, water-worn bones, and a baenid turtle were preserved all around. Corythosaurus probably lived in a woodland forest, and might have occasionally wandered into swampy areas. Herbivores of the Oldman Formation, Corythosaurus in the background A limited fauna is known from the upper section of the Oldman Formation, and Corythosaurus casuarius as well as C. intermedius are among the taxa. Also from the section of the formation are the theropods Daspletosaurus, and Saurornitholestes, the hadrosaurids Brachylophosaurus, Gryposaurus and Parasaurolophus, the ankylosaurid Scolosaurus, and the ceratopsians Coronosaurus and Chasmosaurus. Other genera are known, but do not persist from the upper section of the formation, and therefore are not contemporaries of Corythosaurus. Corythosaurus casuarius is widespread throughout the lower unit of the Dinosaur Park Formation. In it, Corythosaurus was found to be closely associated with the ceratopsid Centrosaurus apertus. Their associating was found in the Dinosaur Park, Judith River, and Mesaverde formations, and also in the Wind River Basin and the Wheatland County area. Corythosaurus lived alongside numerous other giant herbivores, such as the hadrosaurids Gryposaurus and Parasaurolophus, the ceratopsids Centrosaurus and Chasmosaurus, and ankylosaurids Scolosaurus, Edmontonia and Dyoplosaurus in the earliest stages of the formation, Dyoplosaurus, Panoplosaurus and Euoplocephalus in the middle age, and Euoplocephalus alone in later stages of the formation. Studies of the jaw anatomy and mechanics of these dinosaurs suggests they probably all occupied slightly different ecological niches in order to avoid direct competition for food in such a crowded eco-space. The only large predators known from the same levels of the formation as Corythosaurus are the tyrannosaurids Gorgosaurus libratus and an unnamed species of Daspletosaurus. Thomas M. Lehman has observed that Corythosaurus hasn't been discovered outside of southern Alberta even though it is one of the most abundant Judithian dinosaurs in the region. Large herbivores like the hadrosaurs living in North America during the Late Cretaceous had \\"remarkably small geographic ranges\\" despite their large body size and high mobility. This restricted distribution strongly contrasts with modern mammalian faunas whose large herbivores' ranges \\"typical[ly] ... span much of a continent.\\" See also * Timeline of hadrosaur research Footnotes p. 158 in Norrell, M. et al.

The King Fahd Causeway ( Jisr al-Malik Fahd) is a series of bridges and causeways connecting Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. At 25 km. (15.5 mi.), the western terminus of the causeway is the al-Khour neighbourhood of Khobar, Saudi Arabia and the eastern terminus is Al Jasra, Bahrain. Its five bridges rest on 536 concrete pylons, with seven embankments in the Gulf's shallower water. One of the embankments, known as Middle Island ( al-Jazirat al-Wustaa') has been converted into a sizeable artificial island with customs and immigration facilities, a mosque and gardens and fast food restaurants. Another island towards the end of the causeway belongs to Bahrain and is simply known as Mother of Sleepiness ( Um al-Na'saan). Since 8 March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the causeway is temporarily closed down to all passenger traffic in order to stem the spread of the COVID-19 virus between the two countries. Commercial cargo trucks are still allowed to cross the border following stringent checks. The causeway reopened on July 23 2020, the Saudi Arabia's embassy in Bahrain announce that citizens can return to the Kingdom via the King Fahd Causeway without prior permission. On September 10, 2020, the causeway is listed as closed to most non-commercial traffic on the U.S. Embassy in Bahrain website. History The King Fahd Causeway spans long stretches of sea and reclaimed land. The idea of constructing the causeway was based on improving the links and bonds between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Maritime surveying began in 1968, construction began in 1981 and continued until the official opening to the public in 1986. Since its completion in 1986, the causeway has streamlined commerce and strengthened cultural and social bonds between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. The idea of building a bridge linking Bahrain to the Eastern region Saudi Arabia had been enticing the two kingdoms for generations. The idea was born during an official visit to Bahrain in 1954 and King Saud's wish to nurture and further solidify the bond between the two. In 1965, plans to construct the causeway began to take form officially when Sheikh Khalifah ibn Sulman Al Khalifah, the Prime Minister of Bahrain, paid a courtesy visit to King Faisal at which time the king expressed his wish to move forward. Subsequently, Bahrain, which drove on the left, changed to driving on the right in 1967.Bahrain Government Annual Reports, Volume 8, Archive Editions, 1987, page 92 This was to bring it into line with neighbouring countries.Bahrain Government Annual Reports, Times of India Press, 1968, page 158 In 1968, a joint committee was formed to assess the finances required for undertaking the task. As a result, the committee requested the World Bank contribute assistance to implement the mammoth-sized project including environmental and geographical aspects of the region. In the summer of 1973, King Faisal, in a meeting which included Emir Sheikh Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa as well as prince Fahd bin Abdul Aziz and Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, suggested the committee overlook economic and financial issues with the project instead concentrating on the actual construction. In 1975, the World Bank submitted its study and advice after seeking assistance from specialist international expertise in studying the geographic, environmental factors and maritime currents. In the spring of 1976, during a visit by King Khalid bin Abdul Aziz to Sheikh Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the two monarchs agreed to set up a ministerial committee to work on implementation of the project. The causeway from the Bahrain side. On 8 July 1981, Mohammed Aba Al- Khail, minister for Finance and National Economy of Saudi Arabia and Yousuf Ahmed Al-Shirawi, minister of Industrial Development in Bahrain signed an agreement to start construction on the maritime causeway. On 11 November 1982, King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz and Sheikh Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa unveiled the curtain on the Memorial Plaque during a formal ceremony attended by leaders of the GCC states marking the beginning of the project. On 11 April 1985, Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the Prime Minister of Bahrain, pressed the button to install the final part of the box bridges thereby finally linking Saudi mainland with the island of Bahrain. On 26 November 1986, the causeway was officially inaugurated in the presence of King Fahd and Shaikh Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, with the latter consenting to naming the bridge King Fahd Causeway. , an estimated 25,104 vehicles use the causeway daily. The 2010 total number of travelers across the causeway from both countries was 19.1 million passengers, or an average of 52,450 passengers per day. Construction details The project cost a total of US$800 million (SAR3 billion). Al- Muhandis Nizar Kurdi Consulting Engineers was the sole Saudi partner of the consulting group (Saudi Danish Consultants) which completed the study, design and construction supervision of the Causeway. One of the major contractors of the project was Ballast Nedam, based in the Netherlands. It is unclear how many workers were engaged in the construction of the Causeway. The four-lane road is long and approximately wide, and was built using of concrete along with 47,000 metric tonnes of reinforced steel. The causeway was constructed in three segments starting from Saudi Arabia: # From Al-Aziziyyah, south of Khobar, to the Border Station on Passport Island # From the Border Station to Nasan Island in Bahrain # From Nasan island to Al-Jasra, Northern Governorate, on the main island of Bahrain Strict quality control regimes were established to ensure durability of the structure. In this regard, Al Hoty Stanger Ltd, the premier testing laboratory with SASO accreditation, was contracted to perform materials testing on both sides of the causeway project. The production equipment for the bridge segments were supplied by the Dutch machine building company H.J. Grimbergen B.V.  Border station  The Border Station is located on embankment No.4, which, with a total area of , is the biggest of all embankments. This artificial island is known as Passport Island or Middle Island. The buildings of King Fahd Causeway Authority and other government Directorates were erected on the Border Station, as well as two mosques, two Coast Guard towers and two tower restaurants. The border station also has extensive landscaping all around the islands in addition to the services and road stations. The Border Station was designed as two connected islands, with the west side designated as Saudi Arabian and the east as Bahraini. The Saudi side of the Border Station has outlets of McDonald's and Kudu while the Bahraini side of the Border Station has a McDonald's outlet. The bridge leading to mainland Saudi Arabia. One-stop crossing was introduced on the King Fahad Causeway from 6 March 2017. Under the new system, commuters will only have to stop at one post for passport control, car clearance and customs. The measure will ease travel for commuters and is also expected to ease traffic congestion on the highway as the previous system required multiple stops at Saudi and Bahraini check posts. Expansion On 6 July 2010, Saudi newspapers quoted King Fahd Causeway Authority chief Bader Abdullah Al-Otaishan as saying that the King Fahd Causeway was to undergo a major expansion projected to cost $5.3 million. It was announced that the number of departure lanes would be increased from 10 to 17 and the number of arrival lanes from 13 to 18 on both sides. The renovation includes construction of a commercial center on the Bahraini side. \\"It will have a number of restaurants, coffee shops, a grocery shop, telephone stalls and a shop to meet travelers‚Äô needs,\\" said Al-Otaishan. \\"We saw that there was a need for such a center to assist travelers.\\". With points including climate controlled washrooms and meeting places, the average traveler can be better facilitated. He said work was under way and that the center would be completed by the first quarter of the next year. A Bahraini health center was also being built to serve travelers and causeway staff. \\"It will feature an emergency room and ambulance to serve whoever is using the causeway ‚Äî travelers or employees,\\" he said, noting a Saudi health center was also planned for 2011. A security checkpoint near the Bahraini entrance of the causeway was to be added to the checkpoint near the Saudi entrance. \\"It will allow us to control the causeway and close it,\\" Al-Otaishan said. The project also included expanded public utilities such as washrooms and mosques on both sides of the causeway, to be completed by the end of 2011. A separate project, to revamp the two tower restaurants, one Saudi and one Bahraini, was announced. The renovation would not alter the towers' historic appearance. Al-Otaishan told local newspapers that tenders for the project on the Saudi side had already been approved, with the Bahraini side set to follow suit.

The Legislature is a bicameral body composed of the upper house Wisconsin State Senate and the lower Wisconsin State Assembly, both of which have had Republican majorities since January 2011. With both houses combined, the legislature has 132 members representing an equal number of constituent districts. The Legislature convenes at the state capitol in Madison. History The land that would become Wisconsin became part of the United States in 1783 and was first organized under the Northwest Ordinance. It became the Wisconsin Territory in 1836 and the state of Wisconsin on May 29, 1848.Highlights of History in Wisconsin, Wisconsin Blue Book 2011-2012 (accessed April 25, 2013) The 1850s saw an influx of European immigrants.19th Century Immigration, Wisconsin Historical Society (accessed April 25, 2013) Women's rights groups in support of temperance and suffrage formed in Wisconsin in the 1860s.The Women's Suffrage Movement Wisconsin Historical Society (accessed April 25, 2013) The Wisconsin Women's Suffrage Association was formed in 1869. Suffrage bills were introduced in 1855 and 1867 but both failed. However, the state legislature did pass a law allowing women to run for school boards and elective school offices in 1869. It was not until June 10, 1919, that Wisconsin became the first state to ratify the 19th amendment granting national suffrage to women. Wisconsin was dominated alternately by the Republican and Progressive parties in the first century of its existence, but has been more competitive since then. The Republicans gained majority control in both houses in the 1995 Legislature, the first time since 1969. In 2009, the Democratic Party gained control of both houses for the first time since 1993. The Republican Party took back control of both houses in 2011. Governor Scott Walker then signed a new redistricting plan. In 2012 elections, Democrats won a majority of the vote but Republicans retained control of the legislature, taking 60 of the 99 seats in the Assembly. In Wisconsin elections, 2016, Republicans secured their largest majority in the Assembly since 1956. On November 21, 2016, U.S. Circuit Judge Kenneth Francis Ripple, joined by District Judge Barbara Brandriff Crabb, held that the Republicans' 2011 redistricting was unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering, over a dissent by District Judge William C. Griesbach. The court found that the 2011 redistricting plan created three times as many wasted votes as the national average, violating the United States Constitution‚Äôs guarantee of one man, one vote. The Wisconsin State Assembly elections of 2018 were held on Tuesday, November 6, 2018. All 99 seats in the Wisconsin State Assembly were up for election.

Membership =Qualifications and terms= To serve in the Wisconsin Legislature, individuals must be a resident of the state for at least one year preceding his or her election and be a qualified elector in the district they are elected to represent.Article IV, Wisconsin Constitution (accessed April 25, 2013) All 99 members of the Wisconsin Assembly are elected in a two year term cycle without term limits. Similarly, all 33 members of the Wisconsin Senate are elected in a four year cycle, also without term limits. Half of the Senate is elected every two years. Prior to an amendment in the Wisconsin Constitution in 1881, Assembly members served a one year term, while Senators were elected every two years. The 100th Wisconsin Legislature began on January 3, 2011. =Officers= Members of both houses of the Legislature vote within their ranks to select presiding officers, such as the Speaker of the Assembly and the President of the Senate. These high level positions reflect the party majority in both chambers. An amendment to the state constitution in 1979 removed the Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin as the presiding officer of the Senate, allowing Senators to vote within their ranks for a chamber president. Similarly, majority and minority leaders are also selected by party strength in the legislative houses and within their own respective caucus. =Salary and benefits= Legislators receive an annual salary of $49,943 and a per diem of up to $88 to cover living expenses when they are in Dane County, Wisconsin on state business, unless their district is in Dane County. Members of the Madison delegation may receive a per diem up to $44 to cover expenses. Legislators also receive $75 per month in \\"out-of-session\\" pay when the Legislature is in session for three days or less. Over two years, each legislator is allotted $66,008 to cover general office expenses, printing, postage and district mailings.

Mauss's original piece was entitled Essai sur le don. Forme et raison de l'√©change dans les soci√©t√©s archa√Øques (\\"An essay on the gift: the form and reason of exchange in archaic societies\\") and was originally published in L'Ann√©e Sociologique in 1925.

Halls,The 1954 translation is in the public domain. https://archive.org/details/giftformsfunctio00maus and in 2016 by Jane I. Guyer.Hau Books, distributed by the University of Chicago Press http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/isbn/9780990505006  Argument  Mauss's essay focuses on the way that the exchange of objects between groups builds relationships between humans. It analyzes the economic practices of various so-called archaic societies and finds that they have a common central practice centered on reciprocal exchange. In them, he finds evidence contrary to the presumptions of modern Western societies about the history and nature of exchange. He shows that early exchange systems center around the obligations to give, to receive, and, most importantly, to reciprocate. They occur between groups, not only individuals, and they are a crucial part of ‚Äútotal phenomena‚Äù that work to build not just wealth and alliances but social solidarity because ‚Äúthe gift‚Äù pervades all aspects of the society. He uses a comparative method, drawing upon published secondary scholarship on peoples from around the world, but especially the Pacific Northwest (especially potlatch). After examining the reciprocal gift-giving practices of each, he finds in them common features, despite some variation. From the disparate evidence, he builds a case for a foundation to human society based on collective (vs. individual) exchange practices. In so doing, he refutes the English tradition of liberal thought, such as utilitarianism, as distortions of human exchange practices. He concludes by speculating that social welfare programs may be recovering some aspects of the morality of the gift within modern market economies.  Influence  The Gift has been very influential in anthropology, where there is a large field of study devoted to reciprocity and exchange. It has also influenced philosophers, artists, and political activists, including Georges Bataille, Jacques Derrida, Jean Baudrillard, and more recently the work of David Graeber and the British theologian John Milbank. Many today see Mauss's work as a guide to how giving can promote a better way of living. The gift-giving and exchange practices Mauss described were often self-interested, but at the same time had a concern for others; the main point of the traditional gift is that it furthers both of these human aspects at the same time.

She spent most of her career as a lead principal dancer at English National Ballet. She is currently a teacher at the Royal Ballet Upper School. Early life and training Klimentov√° is from Prague, and grew up under the Soviet regime. She was first trained as a gymnast, then switched to ballet as she would have a longer career. Klimentov√° had her ballet training at the Prague State Conservatoire of Music and Dance for eight years, and graduated with the highest honour. Career =Dance= In 1989, following her graduation, Klimentov√° joined National Theatre Ballet in Prague as a soloist, and was promoted to principal dancer a year later. In 1992, she joined Cape Town City Ballet in South Africa as principal. The following year, she joined the Scottish Ballet as a principal dancer. In 1996, Klimentov√° joined the English National Ballet at the invitation of then-artistic director Derek Deane. She had danced many of the company's repertoire, including Princess Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty, Sugar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker and the title role in Manon. She had created principal roles in Camille, The Snow Queen and Double Concerto. She also had a close creative relationship with the choreographer of the latter, Christopher Hampson. In 2010, Klimentov√° rehearsed with Vadim Muntagirov, 19 years her junior, for his debut in Swan Lake, though he was supposed to dance with guest star Polina Semionova. However, Semionova had to withdraw from opening night as she did not have a visa, so Klimentov√° stepped in and performed. The performance received critical acclaim, and their partnership was compared to Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev's partnership. The rehearsals and performance was featured in the BBC4 documentary Agony and Ecstasy: A Year with English National Ballet. Since then, the two were paired together frequently. Klimentov√° noted it is a partnership she waited for 20 years. In 2014, Klimentov√° announced she would retire from dancing, due to age and \\"just been doing it for so long.\\" Muntagirov, who announced he would join The Royal Ballet around the same time, was consulted. In June, at age 42, Klimentov√° performed her final performance, which was Romeo and Juliet. Muntagirov returned to ENB to dance with her. =Teaching= In 2003, Klimentov√° founded International Ballet Masterclasses in Prague, which invite international stars such as Tamara Rojo, Nicolas Le Riche and Julio Bocca to teach students in Prague. In 2014, she finished training as a teacher at The Royal Ballet School. Later that year, following her retirement as a dancer, she joined the teaching staff of the Royal Ballet Upper School. =Other ventures= In March 2013 Klimentov√° published her autobiography entitled Daria Klimentova ‚Äì Agony and Ecstasy: My Life in Dance in which she detailed both her upbringing in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia and her ballet career.

He was active first in Lexington, Massachusetts, then eventually moved to Farmington, Maine. Like most of his colleagues, Belcher could not make music his main occupation, and worked as tax assessor, schoolmaster, town clerk, and so on; nevertheless he was considerably well known for his musical activities, and even dubbed 'the Handell [sic] of Maine' by a local newspaper. Most of his works survive in The Harmony of Maine, a collection Belcher published himself in Boston in 1794. Life Belcher was born in Stoughton, Massachusetts. In the early 1770s he moved to Boston to embark on a merchant's career, but returned to Stoughton just a few years later. He was a private during the Revolutionary War, part of the company of Stoughton Minutemen that marched to Cambridge on April 19, 1775Crawford, Cooke, Grove. immediately after receiving the alarm from Lexington. Later, he was promoted to the rank of Captain under Washington. Around 1778 he bought a farm in Canton, Massachusetts and established a tavern there; he was known then as \\"Uncle Ply.\\" It was at his tavern that some of the early singing meetings in the area were held, but contrary to some written accounts, Belcher never joined the Stoughton Musical Society. Also, he was not a pupil at the Stoughton singingschool, where William Billings taught in 1774.Hall.p 3 After the war, in 1785, he moved first to Hallowell (now Augusta), Maine with his family, and then six years later they moved to Farmington, where Belcher remained until his death. He became a prominent citizen, serving as tax assessor, schoolmaster, town clerk, justice of the peace, magistrate, and even representative to the Massachusetts General Court. He was very successful in his musical activities as well: he apparently led Farmington's first choir, and attracted favourable reviews. When writing about the composer in his diary, Rev. Paul Coffin wrote: \\"Squire Belcher called his singers together and gave us an evening of sweet music.\\"Butler, p. 159 After the 1796 performance of Belcher's Ordination Anthem, parts of which bear resemblance to Handel's famous Messiah chorus, a Maine newspaper dubbed the composer 'the Handell of Maine'. Belcher was also active as violinist and singer. He died in Farmington on June 9, 1836. Works Most of Belcher's 75 extant works survive in a volume titled The Harmony of Maine, which the composer published in 1794 in Boston. That collection only includes pieces by Belcher. The music is firmly rooted in the tradition of New England psalmody and William Billings in particular, although it also shows other influences (e.g. Handel, as in Ordination Anthem). Most of the pieces are in four voices and based on sacred texts, with a few exceptions‚Äîsome three-voice pieces and several works with secular texts, frequently with lavishly ornamented melodic lines. Belcher composed fuguing tunes rather like those of Billings, but often with more precise performance directions. His voice-leading is considerably smoother and follows the \\"rules\\" more frequently than the work of many of his contemporaries, for instance avoiding the parallel perfect intervals and open fifths which are a common feature of New England psalmody. The Harmony of Maine was never widely reprinted, and, like all composers of the First New England School, by mid-19th century Belcher was forgotten everywhere except a few rural areas. His works, like those of his colleagues, were rediscovered in the second half of the 20th century.Kroeger, Grove. A 1978 work by American avant-garde composer John Cage, Some of the \\"Harmony of Maine\\", is a collection of organ pieces based on compositions from The Harmony of Maine. Cage also adapted a number of Belcher's chorales for use in his Apartment House 1776, and these were subsequently arranged for string quartet by Irvine Arditti along with Cage's adaptations of works by William Billings, Jacob French, Andrew Law, and James Lyon as 44 Harmonies, and performed by the Arditti Quartet and issued on CD by Mode Records.

It is currently maintained by Parks Victoria. The park provides public open space for recreation, as well as sporting facilities (accessed on a fee paying basis) and a wedding and function venue. Location and facilities Wattle Park is located in the Melbourne suburb of Burwood within the City of Whitehorse, approximately 13 km east of Melbourne's CBD. There are two children's playgrounds, BBQs, tables and seats. Two heritage 'W' Class trams offer shelter. The Wattle Park Chalet is located within the park. The Chalet has been used as a wedding venue and function centre since it opened in 1928. Oral sources suggest that this is the oldest continuously running wedding venue in Melbourne. Public toilets are located near Wattle Park Chalet on Monsborough Drive, the access road off Riversdale Road. There is a large grassed sports oval and a nine-hole public golf course with cafe, and public tennis courts are available by booking Wattle Park Golf Course. There are a number of walking tracks through the bush and a perimeter track. Dogs are permitted in the park on a lead. Wattle Park Chalet The Wattle Park Chalet was built in 1928 as a tea-house and function venue. It is an elegant structure in the rustic Tudor style of English architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. The Wattle Park Chalet was designed by Melbourne architect Alan Monsborough and is located at the centre of Wattle Park. In one of the earliest stories of recycling; the timber beams used for building the chalet were recycled from other, earlier structures. The roof slates came from the former Yarra Bend Asylum. Bricks came from cable tram engine-house chimneys. The front porch was added later, in 1937. The construction of the chalet involved several sub- contractors. The Builders' Labourers' Federation stopped construction work on 7 March 1928, demanding higher pay. They returned to work approximately four weeks later at the same pay rate. Two smaller single-storey wings branch off the chalet's main hall. The west wing originally contained the caretaker's residence, and the east wing contained the kitchen and kiosk. Between the wings was a paved courtyard. The paving was recycled from the former tramway engine house on Alexandra Avenue and old cable tram sheds. Heritage and the Lone Pine Approximately one-third of the park is recorded as a heritage place by Heritage Victoria, and the National Trust of Australia has also classified the park. The \\"Lone Pine\\" tree growing near the main carpark is listed on the National Trust's Significant Tree Register, being one of the country's few original Lone Pines. The tree was grown from the seed of a cone collected by one of the Australian soldiers involved in the Gallipoli Campaign from the lone pine tree in Gallipoli, Turkey as a reminder of this notable battle and the ANZACs' involvement in World War I. Planted in Wattle Park on 8 May 1933 at the Trooping of the Colour by the 24th Battalion, the tree was the first Lone Pine to ever be publicly planted as an ANZAC memorial, pre-dating the one planted at Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance by a month, and the one at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra by seventeen months. Flora and fauna The park contains areas of indigenous remnant bush land which has been identified as regionally significant. The Urban Fauna Survey Unit (Department of Conservation Forests and Lands, 1989) nominated the site as one of regional significance on the basis of its high diversity of common native fauna in a suburban environment. There are recorded to be at least twenty species of butterfly, sixty species of beetle, three species of frogs, bats, skinks, ringtail and brushtail possums. The park's bird life includes kookaburras, rosellas, rainbow lorikeets, galahs, and gang-gang cockatoos.\\"Parks Victoria: Wattle Park\\", Parks Victoria. Accessed 21 July 2009 History A small wattle tree in bloom, August 2006 The park was first created when the Hawthorn Tramway Trust (HTT) purchased 137 acres (554,000 m¬≤) of land from Eliza Welch, under the condition it was to be used as a public park. the park was formerly the residence of the late Cr. Orlando Fenwick, who became Lord Mayor of Melbourne. It was known as Fenwick's Paddock when purchased for about ¬£2500 by the late Mrs. Welch (proprietress of Ball and Welch Pty. Ltd.). The park opened on 31 March 1917 when Sir Arthur Stanley planted a Golden Wattle and named the park.\\"Wattle Park ‚Äì a tramway tradition\\", Friends of Hawthorn Tram Depot. Accessed 21 July 2009 Due to the HTT's financial troubles, further development of the park was put off for some time. After the HTT had been amalgamated into the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board, it was put off due to work on electrifying Melbourne's cable tramways. Planning and development of the park started in the 1920s and 30s, with a plantation of 12,000 wattle trees planted in between 1926 and 1928 laid out in a wide belt as a hedge around the outskirts of the area. Lawns and flower beds were laid down, winding pathways built, and a small stream trickling through the centre of the park was cleaned and widened and. Fringed with willows and poplars. On the north eastern slopes, a splendid natural forest, consisting chiefly of poplars, gums, woolly butt and eucalyptus longifolia, was carefully preserved. The Wattle Park Chalet containing a cafe, dancing floor and other- amenities. considerable ingenuity was shown in the building of this chalet. Bricks from old tramway chimneys were extensively used, while the roof contained slates from the demolished Yarra Bend Asylum. Rafters and other timbers came from disused car barns, stones from old rookeries along Alexander-avenue, while the pavements of the promenade in front of the chalet and elsewhere were made from. broken slates from old- tramway engine houses and was completed in 1928 and served as a tea house for light refreshments and recreation, as well as a scenic wedding and function venue. Fencing posts around the boundaries of the park were manufactured from -old. tramway, rails, and a children's joy wheel was made from, a tramway 'cable wheel. The chalet was built, on the highest slope in the. park, about, 320 feet above sea level, and from its balconies a splendid panoramic view of Melbourne was obtained. Children's playgrounds were laid out, swings, joy wheels, a wading pool and other attractions installed. Cable car dummies were transformed into shelters and places where meals could be enjoyed. A sports oval was laid out alongside the chalet, along with two tennis courts. Facing Boundary-Road, (now Warrigal Road) was one of the most conspicuous spots in the park, a miniature lake planted with water lilies and stocked with goldfish. This lake used to be the dam of the old homestead. (\\"The Age\\" Sat 4 Feb 1933 p6). A 9-hole golf course opened at Wattle Park in October 1937, with other facilities following later. With the rise of popularity of motor cars in the 1960s and 70s, the MMTB (which was absorbed by the new Metropolitan Transit Authority in 1983) was focusing its attention elsewhere. Subsequently, local residents began to complain to the state government about the poor state of Wattle Park. In 1991, ownership of Wattle Park was passed from the Public Transport Corporation to the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, which undertook a program to rehabilitate the park's landscape. Connection with trams A route 70 tram viewed from the park As Wattle Park, for most of its history, had been maintained by Melbourne's tram operators, it retains a connection with Melbourne's tramways. The Melbourne Tramways Band (no longer sponsored by Yarra Trams) plays at Wattle Park once a month during spring and autumn. The bodies of two W2 class trams are installed as shelters at Wattle Park, and tram route 70 runs along the park's northern boundary, with its terminus at the easternmost end of the park.

It is near Dundas West station on the TTC's Line 2 Bloor‚ÄìDanforth, but is not directly connected to it. Overview The station is located north of Bloor Street West between Lansdowne Avenue and Dundas Street West. Bloor Street dips down here to cross under all the tracks, and the station is reached by stairs from its north sidewalk. Bloor station serves eastbound and westbound Kitchener line and UP Express trains on the Weston Subdivision, locally oriented northwest-southeast. Following the Georgetown South railway expansion in 2015, the Weston subdivision is designed to have four tracks with two island platforms, each with a high-level section for the UP Express and a low-level section for the Kitchener line. However, as of 2016, the line only has three tracks, making the easternmost platform effectively a side platform. Parallel to these tracks along their southwest side, is the Galt Subdivision which carries the Milton line. There is no platform for Milton line services, so those trains pass by the station without stopping. GO has considered adding the station to the Milton line, but it is not in current plans. Until 1996 there was an additional parallel track on the northeast side of the station which belonged to the Canadian Pacific Railway and was used for access to local industries. Its former right-of-way is now used for the West Toronto Railpath, providing a pedestrian and cyclist connection to the neighbourhoods to the north, east, and south. Covered bicycle parking is located at the station's entrances from the path. Bloor is one of the few GO stations which does not have any parking for cars. Prior to the introduction of Union Pearson Express, only 200 passengers used the station per day, a number which was expected to increase to 1,000 with the opening of the UP Express. Metrolinx is projecting 2,000 riders will use the station daily by 2031. UPX president Kathy Haley said 25 per cent of UPX riders are expected to use Bloor Station. Georgetown South Expansion A Union Pearson Express train arriving at Bloor heading toward Union Station. Bloor station was substantially rebuilt as a part of the Georgetown South railway expansion project to allow for Union Pearson Express service. The formerly 2-track Weston Subdivision was expanded to 3 tracks, and the former side platforms became island platforms. High-level sections were added at the southeast end of each platform near Bloor street for use by the Union Pearson Express, and the low-level sections for the Kitchener line were correspondingly lengthened at the northwest end. Other improvements to the station include an indoor concourse at street level with a staffed ticket booth, elevators, heated shelters, bicycle storage and signage. In February 2016 a kiss-and-ride was opened at Dundas Street West and Edna Avenue, connecting to a new second entrance to the station. Connection to Dundas West station Dundas West subway station has only a single entrance, on Dundas Street, so passengers connecting to Bloor station must walk eastward for some 200 metres along city streets. Since the subway platforms happen to extend eastward from the station entrance, a direct tunnel from the GO station to the east end of the subway station would be relatively short. In March 2011 when Metrolinx announced the station expansion plans associated with the Georgetown South Project, the second entrance to the station was to have a direct connection to the Dundas West subway platforms. In the fall of 2012 when construction began, work did not include an underground TTC connection, which was to be completed instead in 2017. However, in March 2016, Metrolinx officials said it will take five years to build a tunnel between the two stations because of the need to expropriate property. Metrolinx began proceedings to expropriate necessary properties in September 2017. As of February 2019, construction is expected to start in late 2020 with the tunnel opening in 2022.

His style of painting is sometimes termed \\"the Muscovite mannerism\\". Dionisy's first important commission was a series of icons for the Cathedral of the Dormition in the Moscow Kremlin, executed in 1481. The figures on his icons are famously elongated, the hands and feet are diminutive, and the faces serene and peaceful. Among his many rich and notable patrons, Joseph of Volokolamsk alone commissioned him to paint more than eighty icons, primarily for the Joseph- Volokolamsk and Pavel-Obnorsk cloisters. The most comprehensive and the best preserved work of Dionisy is the monumental fresco painting of the Virgin Nativity Cathedral of the Ferapontov Monastery (1495‚Äì96) in Vologda Oblast. The frescoes, depicting scenes from the life of the Virgin in singularly pure and gentle colours, are permeated with a solemn and festal mood. The work at the Ferapontov was executed by Dionisy in collaboration with his sons and disciples, who continued a Dionisiesque tradition after the master's death. His son Feodosy painted the mural of \\"Michael and Joshua before the battle of Jericho\\" in the Cathedral of the Annunciation of the Moscow Kremlin in 1508.Biblical Military Imagery in the Political Culture of Early Modern Russia:The Blessed Host of the Heavenly Tsar, Daniel Rowland, Medieval Russian Culture, Vol. 2, ed.

It is part of the North Ward, and was famously the heart of the city's large Little Italy. In its heyday, Seventh Avenue had a population of 30,000, including 11,000 children, in an area of less than a square mile. The center of life in the neighborhood was St. Lucy's Church, founded by Italian immigrants in 1891.Immerso, Michael (2004). Newark's Little Italy: The Vanished First Ward, p. 65.

The most famous procession was the Feast of St. Gerard,Immerso (2004), p. 83. but there were also great feasts for Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, Our Lady of Snow, the Assumption, and St. Rocco.

Shrine of St. Gerard at St. Lucy's Church One of the nation's largest Italian newspapers, The Italian Tribune, was founded on Seventh Avenue. Seventh Avenue produced stars such as Joe Pesci and Frankie Valli of the Four Seasons. Congressman Peter Rodino, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee during its impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon was a native of the First Ward as well. Seventh Avenue was notoriously devastated following urban renewal efforts during the 1950s. Eighth Avenue was obliterated by the city council, scattering the Italian American residents to make way for the construction of the Columbus Homes housing project and Interstate 280. The area experienced one of the highest crime rates in the city during the 70s and was devastated by arson fires, leaving a landscape of rubble and burned out buildings. In the aftermath of that destruction, the neighborhood was largely rebuilt by erecting townhouses throughout much of the area, although most of its businesses never recovered.Immerso (2004), pp. 140‚Äì41. The construction of Interstate 280 also served to cut the neighborhood off from the rest of the city. During the destruction which occurred after urban renewal, some of the First Ward's Italians stayed in the neighborhood, while others migrated to other Newark neighborhoods like Broadway, Roseville, and the Ironbound. Seventh Avenue has people of all ethnic groups, with Puerto Ricans being prominent. There is still a large Italian American population, and there are many signs of the Italian presence in the area; however, next to a vacant lot, Giordano's at 33 Seventh Avenue is now closed. St. Lucy's Church, which is now in a beautiful 1925 building, still exists and has a large feast for St. Gerard every October. The Feast of St. Gerard is a kind of reunion for old First Warders. By their proximity to I-280, the Christopher Columbus Homes became a highly visible advertisement of Newark's poverty. As residents dwindled away, the Newark Housing Authority took to painting curtains and plants in apartment windows to create the illusion of habitation. Demolition of the projects began in 1994 and is now complete. Townhouses have been built on the former site of the projects, as well as throughout much of the rest of the neighborhood, replacing the vacant and burned out buildings, but the old street grid was not restored. The Seventh Avenue neighborhood lies between the Orange Street and Broad Street stations on the Newark Light Rail. The Seventh Avenue neighborhood is bound by Interstate 280 to the south, Clifton Avenue to the west, Bloomfield Avenue to the north, and Broadway and Broad Street to the east.

Original drawing by Moravian Bishop Levin Theodor Reichel (1812-1878). Hebron is the name of a former Moravian mission that was the northernmost settlement in Labrador. Founded in 1831, the mission disbanded in 1959. The Inuit Abraham Ulrikab family, exhibited in zoos in Europe in 1880, were from Hebron. Climate The site has an unusual sub-type of arctic (tundra) climate, characterized by a high average annual precipitation with half the precipitation occurring during the five coldest months (51% of the total falling from October through March). January, for example, averages -21 ¬∞C (-6 ¬∞F) and has of water-equivalent precipitation on average, perhaps the most humid air at that temperature experienced anywhere on earth. History Moravians began establishing missions in Labrador in 1771. The first was located at Nain. The Moravians sought to evangelize the Inuit people in Labrador. In 1831, the Moravian church established a mission at Hebron, a site located about north of Nain. Life was hard at the settlement. Epidemics of whooping cough, influenza and smallpox ran through the community periodically. The flu epidemic of 1918 was believed to have wiped out a third of the 1,200-member Inuit population of Labrador. =Abandonment= In 1955, a member of the International Grenfell Association, an organization dedicated to the health and welfare of residents of Newfoundland and Labrador, wrote to the Government of Canada expressing concern about cramped living conditions at Hebron that had led to tuberculosis and a shortage of firewood. After consultation with Moravian leaders, the decision was made to close the mission. The Inuit would be resettled into larger communities. \\"I see no other way than to suggest the Mission withdraw from Hebron this summer,\\" said the Rev. Siegfried Hettasch. By April 1959, there were 58 families at Hebron. The decision was announced at an Easter Monday service in 1959. There was no consultation with community members. By the fall of that year, half of the families had moved on their own. The remainder left soon after the Grenfell nurse was withdrawn and the community store closed in the fall of 1959. The relocation broke up extended families to different communities. Some if not many were sent to communities where promised housing was not available. A report written for the Canadian Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples said the relocation led to poverty for several of the Inuit. \\"They were put in places where they weren't familiar with the local environment so they didn't know where to hunt, fish or trap and aside from that, all of the best places were already claimed by people who originally lived in those communities,\\" said the report's author, Carol Brice- Bennet. Aftermath The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1976. It is frequently visited by cruise ships. The buildings of the original mission still stand. The main mission building has been undergoing renovation by Inuit volunteers and are in reasonably good condition considering the passage of time. In 2005, Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams apologized to people affected by the relocations. In August 2009, the provincial government unveiled a monument at the site of Hebron with an inscribed apology for the site closure.

With the communications antenna on the roof, the total height is . The International Style office tower was built by Peter Dickinson, with associate architects Ross, Fish, Duschenes and Barrett, and was the city's tallest building from 1962 to 1963. The building holds offices for the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the corporate law firm Stikeman Elliott, as well as numerous other businesses. The building is located at 1155 Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard West next to Dorchester Square facing the imposing but dwarfed Sun Life Building. Part of the fire-damaged Windsor Hotel was demolished to make room for construction, with the remaining portion being converted to offices in the 1980s. History The project was initiated by the Canadian Bank of Commerce and announced in 1959. While the building was under construction, the Bank of Commerce merged with the Imperial Bank of Canada to form the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, effective June 1, 1961. The Imperial Bank abandoned its concurrent plan for a new head office at 612 McGill Street; that building was instead occupied by Cr√©dit foncier franco-canadien, and since 1988 by Quebecor. Completed in 1962 only a few months before Place Ville-Marie, the CIBC Tower was the tallest building in Canada and the entire Commonwealth of Nations when it was first built, until being surpassed later that year by Place Ville-Marie where a penthouse was added by the competing Royal Bank for that express purpose. The Consulate of Israel was on the 26th floor of the building and as such, it was sometimes the site of demonstrations related to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. The consulate has since relocated to Westmount Square in Westmount. Architecture The tower is exceptionally slender with only of gross floor area per floor, because of a zoning regulation limiting the total building floor area to twelve times the property area. Its fa√ßade is more ornamental than that of the average International style tower, with horizontal strips of glass curtain wall alternating with spandrels of various types of stone, including green slate that was quarried in Wales. The building was fully renovated in 1991, and the highly visible CIBC logo at the top was redesigned in 2004 and again in 2013. Inside, levels 15 and 29 are transfer floors; level 16 is a triple-height mechanical floor that is skipped in the floor numbering of the passenger elevators. Levels 42-44 are also mechanical floors; level 45 was originally an indoor observation deck but was closed in the 1970s. The top of the tower are actually an open-air raised partition, built sometime after construction, that hides the rooftop elevator control rooms. Without this extra structure, the actual roof height is , and approximately when counting the elevator penthouse.

The phone is an update of the Nokia 3100, while adding features from the Nokia 7250i. Like the Nokia 7250i, the phone has an integrated CIF camera. Compared to the Nokia 7250i, the Nokia 3200 was a more affordable, youth-oriented phone, while the 7250i was oriented more towards fashion-conscious users. Other features include an XHTML browser, alarm clock, flashlight, EDGE and FM stereo radio with a 128 √ó 128 12-bit (4096) color screen. The phone has multimedia features such as picture and text messaging. Features carried over from the Nokia 3100 include ringer profiles and voice memo capability. It also has Java games (max downloadable size of game or application cannot exceed 64 kB). The phone has an extensive calendar with a lunar calendar (for the Chinese/Asian variants). The flashlight is located under the phone and can be activated by holding the \\"star\\" (asterisk) key. The camera is on the back of the phone. The 3200 can also play both polyphonic and monophonic ringtones. The phone's visual interface in its menu system is similar to that of the Nokia 3100, using large, static icons rather than animated ones. An interesting feature present in this phone is that the face plate system allows users to print out their own cut-out cover designs and use it in the phone. The official special released designs include \\"Snowboard,\\" \\"Street life\\" and \\"Urban chic\\". It was thus marketed as being \\"fun and funky\\" with a unique style.https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20030912005192/en/Nokia-3200-Phone- Offers-Do-It-Yourself-Personalization-Mobile While the phone's feature set was an improvement over the Nokia 3100, the 3200 did not quite enjoy the popularity that the 3100 did. Some known complaints with the phone included its low CIF resolution camera, quirky keypad design, and its small 12-bit color display. This kept the 3100, and its redesign, the 3120, in production, while the 3200 was discontinued and replaced by its successor, the Nokia 3220. The Nokia 3220 addresses some of the 3200's known flaws, upgrading to a higher VGA resolution camera with video recording capability, redesigning the keypad to a more standard layout, and improving the display to a 16-bit color LCD. Versions * Nokia 3200b (RH-31) for North America - Operates on GSM 850/1800/1900 with GPRS and EDGE technology. * Nokia 3200 (RH-30) for Europe / Asia - Operates on GSM 900/1800/1900 with GPRS and EDGE technology. * Nokia 3205 - Operates on CDMA2000 800/1900 and AMPS 800 with CDMA2000 1xRTT technology.

Reception  Kent German of CNET gave the phone 3.5 out of 5 stars, lauding its extensive personalization options, its ability to send and receive instant messages, built-in speakerphone FM radio, decent battery life, infra-red port, and compatibility with the EDGE network while panning its \\"somewhat flimsy\\" plastic casing, \\"confusing\\" keypad layout, \\"unintuitive\\" multimedia messaging, \\"basic\\" CIF camera and its 1 MB of shared memory. The PhoneArena team was more positive, giving the phone a 7 out of 10. Unlike CNET they said camera was of \\"satisfactory\\" quality and its battery life was \\"good\\", they further praised its flashlight, FM radio and speakerphone however they panned its lack of appeal for the youth market with its \\"same old form factor\\" with the \\"same old series 40 graphic platform\\".

Kerkouane was one of the most important Punic cities, with Carthage, Hadrumetum (modern Sousse), and Utica. This Phoenician city was probably abandoned during the First Punic War ( BCE) and was not rebuilt by the Romans. It had existed for almost 400 years. UNESCO declared the Punic town of Kerkouane and its necropolis a World Heritage Site in 1985, citing among other things that the remains constitute the only example of a Phoenicio-Punic city to have survived. Name The name Kerkouane was given to the town by archaeologists. Its name in antiquity has not been preserved in any known historical documents. Excavations Kerkouane is a small town and was probably never home to more than 1,200 people, mostly fishermen and craftsmen. Based on the presence of many murex shells, it would appear that the town produced purple dye, in addition to salt and garum (a food product). Excavations of the town have revealed ruins and coins from the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE. Around the site where the layout is clearly visible, many houses still show their walls, and the coloured clay on the facades is often still visible. The town was built on a grid with wide streets and public squares. The houses were built to a standard plan, in accordance with a sophisticated notion of town planning. Traces of red ochre found in excavated tombs are common also to native Libyan burial customs, but the religious and architectural traditions of the town are predominantly of Carthaginian style. A black-figure wine jug decorated with a scene from The Odyssey found with an Ionian cup, and Greek architectural elements like peristyle courtyards and stucco plaster decorations found among the remains of upscale private homes, show the town was influenced by the culture of the greater Mediterranean world. A sanctuary has some columns preserved, and in a small atrium parts of mosaics are found. Curbstones, doorsteps, thresholds, and floors of simple mosaic layers are found all over the ruins. There is an area for ritual banquets and a sacrificial altar. While archaeologists are unsure precisely which deities the temple was dedicated to, they speculate based on artifacts found at the such that it may have been Melqart, Sid and Tanit. Terracotta heads showing two males wearing conical hats resemble Sid and Melqart iconography known from the Temple of Antas in Sardinia.

Wilkins was inducted in the YSU Sports Hall of Fame in 2003. Professional career Wilkins signed with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1994, but played in just six games and did not attempt a single field goal or extra point. The following season, he joined the 49ers. While he only played in seven games, he had a superb season, kicking 12 of 13 field goals. In 1996, he finally saw duty as his team's full-time kicker and did not disappoint, kicking 30 of 34 field goals and all 40 extra point attempts.

It is situated within a gorge carved from the surrounding mountainous limestone terrain by Cedar Creek, a small tributary of the James River. Consisting of horizontal limestone strata, Natural Bridge is the remains of the roof of a cave or tunnel through which the Cedar Creek once flowed. Natural Bridge has been designated a Virginia Historic Landmark and a National Historic Landmark. Since 2016, the bridge and its surroundings have been managed by the Commonwealth of Virginia as Natural Bridge State Park. Geology Rocks in the area are limestones and dolomites from the Ordovician Period, which implies deposition about 470 million years ago. The carbonates of the Natural Bridge occur within the Chepultepec Formation, making the buttress of the bridge, and the Beekmantown Formation, deposited conformably over the Chepultepec and comprising the span and the upper part of the bridge.Spencer, Edgard W. ,1968, Geology of the Natural Bridge, Sugarloaf Mountain, Buchanan, and Arnold Valley quadrangles, Virginia: Report of Investigations 13, Virginia Division of Mineral Resources, Charlottesville, VA, 55 p. and 4 plates. Strata at Natural Bridge are close to horizontal, in contrast with dipping and folded beds as close as away along Highway 11, which points to the fact that structurally the rocks making the Natural Bridge are the bottom part of a syncline. The process of formation of the bridge is less certain, but the ideas proposed by different individuals have in common the importance of three elements: The southeast dipping of the strata, the capability of water to slowly dissolve carbonates, and the existence of numerous fractures. Edgard W. SpencerSpencer, Edgard W., 1964, Natural Bridge and vicinity. Virginia Minerals, v. 10, no. 2, p. 1‚àí6. has provided a summary of the most respected interpretations and produced the presently most widely accepted hypothesis. According to Spencer, the Natural Bridge was the remnant of an underground river tunnel that diverted water to the south. Initially, the underground river started capturing water from the Poague Run about to the north, contributing to enlarge the incipient Cedar Creek drainage basin. Over time, through weathering and erosion, the underground river collapsed and disappeared almost completely, the Natural Bridge being the only surviving relic of the roof of the ancient underground river. The creek's larger flow contributed to form the present-day gorge, significantly increasing the distance from the bottom of the water flow to the roof of the underground channel. Today, the \\"Lost River\\", about upstream from the Natural Bridge, is an example supporting the hypothesis of the underground river. Water from the side of the gorge flows into the Cedar Creek, similarly as the ancestral Cedar Creek underground river allegedly flowed into the Cascade Creek, presently entering the Cedar Creek approximately below the Natural Bridge. History Natural Bridge by Frederic Edwin Church, 1852 The Natural Bridge was a sacred site of the Native American Monacan tribe, who believed it to be the site of a major victory over pursuing Powhatans centuries before the arrival of Europeans in Virginia. In March 1742, a frontiersman named John Howard ‚Äî along with his son and others ‚Äî was commissioned by Governor Gooch to explore the southwest of Virginia as far as the Mississippi River. The party followed Cedar Creek through the Natural Bridge, then floated in buffalo-skin boats down the New, Coal, Kanawha, and Ohio rivers to the Mississippi.Brown, Jr., Stuart E. (1965), Virginia Baron: The Story of Thomas 6th Lord Fairfax, Berryville, Virginia: Chesapeake Book Company, pp 98-99. It is alleged that George Washington also came to the site in 1750 as a young surveyor. To support claims that Washington surveyed the area, tour guides claim the initials \\"G.W.\\" on the wall of the bridge, up, were carved by the future president. Legend also has it that George Washington threw a rock from the bottom of Cedar Creek over the bridge. In 1927, a large stone was found, also engraved \\"G.W.\\" and bearing a surveyor's cross, which historians accepted as proof that he indeed surveyed the bridge. Thomas Jefferson purchased of land including the Natural Bridge from King George III of England for 20 shillings in 1774. He called it \\"the most Sublime of nature's works\\". Jefferson built a two-room log cabin, with one room reserved for guests, beginning its use as a retreat. While President, in 1802, he personally surveyed the area. Many famous guests stayed here, including John Marshall, James Monroe, Henry Clay, Sam Houston, and Martin Van Buren. David Johnson, 1860. Reynolda House One of the earliest paintings of the Natural Bridge was done by Jacob Caleb Ward (1809‚Äì1891) in 1835. It is on view at the Nelson Atkins Museum in Kansas City, Missouri.https://art.nelson- atkins.org/objects/8717/natural-bridge-virginia For years it was the logo of the Pennsylvania Railroad.{Obituary of Jacob Caleb Ward, Bloomfield Record} Natural Bridge was one of the tourist attractions of the new world that Europeans visited during the 18th and 19th centuries. Vacationing guests from all over the world took day trips from Natural Bridge on horseback or horse- drawn carriages to explore the countryside. In 1833, a new owner erected the Forest Inn to accommodate the increasing number of people. The bridge had considerable notoriety during the 19th century. Herman Melville alluded to the bridge in describing Moby-Dick: \\"But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia's Natural Bridge...\\" William Cullen Bryant, another American literary figure, said that Natural Bridge and Niagara Falls were the two most remarkable features of North America. During the 1880s Natural Bridge was a resort owned by Colonel Henry Parsons, who also owned the nearby Rockbridge Inn. In 1927 a nocturnal lighting display of the arch and gorge was designed by Samuel Hibben and Phinehas V. Stephens, illuminating engineers with the Westinghouse Company.Hibben, Samuel G. and Stephens, Phinehas V. The illumination of the Natural Bridge of Virginia, Transactions of the Illuminating Engineering Society, vol. 22, 1927, 1158-1164. The display was formally switched on by President Calvin Coolidge in a 1927 inaugural ceremony. The original display has since been replaced with a sound and light show depicting the biblical seven days of the Creation as described in Genesis. In 2013, nearly , including the bridge, were slated to be sold at auction. To prevent piecemeal development of the landmark, the Virginia Conservation Legacy Fund (VCLF) purchased the bridge, hotel, and surrounding land for $9.1 million, made possible by a loan from the Virginia Clean Water Revolving Loan Fund. When the VCLF soon found itself unable to make payments on that loan, the Commonwealth of Virginia offered to manage the property as a Virginia State Park. Natural Bridge State Park Natural Bridge State Park officially opened on September 24, 2016. As a state park, the property is managed by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, although it remains owned by the VCLF; it is the only state park operating on privately owned land. The property will be transferred to state ownership after the original loan has been paid in full. VCLF continues to both own and manage the nearby Natural Bridge Hotel and Natural Bridge Caverns. Visitors must purchase tickets to view the bridge from below, although the park's fees under state management are about half what had been charged under prior ownership. U.S. Route 11 (Lee Highway) runs on top of the bridge, but protective fences make it difficult to see anything besides the roadway. The state park includes several long-standing attractions, including the trail under the bridge and along Cedar Creek, a recreation of Monacan Native American housing, and the Lace Falls. The \\"Drama of Creation\\" light show continues to be shown in the evening, after the state park is technically closed. One change under state ownership was the removal of Foamhenge, a full-size replica of Stonehenge made entirely out of styrofoam that was formerly located on the property. The attraction was moved to Fairfax County after it was determined that the art installation did not fit with the state park's mission. The new state park was designated an \\"Affiliated Area\\" by the National Park Service in 2016. The designation does not imply ownership or management by the federal government, though it does allow for their technical and financial assistance.

He was originally known as Maverick, and more recently as Agent Zero. The character first appeared in X-Men (vol. 2) #5 and was created by Jim Lee. Daniel Henney portrayed Agent Zero in the 2009 superhero film X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Publication history David North first appeared as Maverick in X-Men #5 (Feb 1992). David North has appeared in a self-titled one-shot Maverick: In the Shadow of Death as well as a self-titled short-lived ongoing series called Maverick. Later, as Agent Zero, he became a regular in the second series of Weapon X. Fictional character biography =Early life= Christoph NordMaverick #2 was born in East Germany to American parents. His early history is clouded in mystery, though there are whispers that his parents were involved with the Nazi regime.Maverick #9 He also had an older brother, Andreas.as told in flashbacks in X-Men Unlimited #15 and Maverick #2 A mutant, Christoph possessed the ability to absorb kinetic energy through impact with little to no harm.X-Men (vol. 2) #5 =Cell Six= A self-described idealist, he fought against the communist regime during the height of the Cold War, joining a West German black ops unit named Cell Six. On a mission in Italy, he was injured by a rival assassin codenamed the Confessor.as told in flashback in Maverick #2 While recovering, he met an Italian nurse, Ginetta Barsalini, whom he fell in love with and married. Over the next three years, Cell Six's field agents were eliminated one by one, except for Nord. Nord realized Ginetta was a spy. Threatening to shoot her, he demanded to know her employer. Saying he didn't have the guts to shoot a defenseless woman in cold blood, she lunged at him with a knife, causing him to shoot her in self-defense. Dying, she revealed that in killing her, he also killed their unborn child. Long after this incident, Nord continues to be wracked with guilt about the betrayal and still seeks answers as to whom Barsalini was working for. This watershed moment left Nord cold and distrusting of everyone, especially women. =Weapon X= Fueled by the betrayal, Nord became one of the most efficient covert operatives in Germany. In the 1960s, his exploits caught the attention of the CIA, who offered him a spot in the clandestine Team X. He agreed, and at this time, changed his name to David North. As a part of Team X, he was one of the several mutant operatives the government experimented on and exploited. Each member unknowingly received false memory implants,Wolverine #62-64 and North received a slight healing factor culled from Logan's DNA.Wolverine Annual (September 1995) North's immediate team consisted of three field agents: North, Logan (who later became Wolverine), and Victor Creed (who later became Sabretooth). The mutant teleporter John Wraith also referred to as Kestrel, served as the team's intelligence man and extractor. It was at this time that North began wearing his signature yellow and black faceplate. On a mission in East Germany, both Creed and Logan were badly injured. Rather than follow protocol and leave them, North dragged them to the extraction point. Cornered by Andreas Nord, now an assassin, North saved his teammates the only way he could; killing his own brother in cold blood. Because of this incident, Logan holds North in very high regard. Another mission saw the three agents confront Omega Red in Berlin. They succeeded in stealing the carbonadium synthesizer, which was necessary for the Russian to control his death factor pheromone. Taking down the psychopathic Omega Red was not as easy. In the chaos, Creed panicked, killing Janice Hollenback, the CIA mole they were attempting to rescue. The team then escaped by jumping from a ten-story window. The synthesizer was thought lost, and a rift formed between Creed and Logan due to Creed's actions on the mission. Unbeknownst to the agency, Logan had recovered the synthesizer and hid it. North suspected as much at the time but did not know for sure.as told in flashbacks in X-Men Vol. 2 #5 and Wolverine #60 By the early 1970s, Team X was summarily disbanded. However, the team's agents were captured by Weapon X to be used as test subjects. When Logan underwent the adamantium bonding, he went on a murderous rampage, allowing North and the others to escape. Around this time, North inexplicably lost his powers. Undaunted, North continued to work in espionage as a mercenary using the trade name Maverick. The inspiration for the name had come from a conversation in which North boasted that he neither trusted nor needed anyone, to which Logan responded, \\"A regular maverick, eh?\\" =Mercenary= Time passed and Maverick developed a reputation as one of the best-hired guns available. Maverick compensated for his lack of powers with meticulous planning and a reliance on the latest technology. He worked for private parties and governmental agencies alike, taking several contracts from retired Major Arthur Barrington, the man who had brought North into the CIA. When Omega Red captured Wolverine as well as several of the X-Men in Berlin in an effort to locate the carbonadium synthesizer, Maverick was sent in by Barrington. Maverick helped free the captive X-Men and tracked Sabretooth to Omega Red. With the X-Men's help, he obtained the device from Wolverine and hid it once again. Maverick aided the X-Men in combat against Sabretooth, Omega Red, Fenris, and Matsu'o Tsurayaba. During the course of this incident, Maverick murders apparently Dr. Abraham Cornelius in cold blood.X-Men Vol. 2 #5-7 Barrington later sent him to acquire the Xavier Files, profiles of the powers and weaknesses of various mutants, which were compiled by the X-Men's founder. Maverick battled Warhawk and killed Dr. Alexander Ryking. In the clash, Warhawk exploded, seemingly destroying the files.X-Men Vol. 2 #10-11 Maverick was later hired by the US government to protect Aldo Ferro, a former Weapon X member. Former Team X alumni sought Ferro out after Mastodon died when his age suppression factor reversed. Unbeknownst to Team X, Ferro was the second Psi-Borg and was responsible for the planting of false memories during their time with Weapon X. Betrayed by Ferro, Maverick then sided with his former teammates Wolverine, Sabretooth, Silver Fox, and John Wraith, and Ferro was seemingly killed in the subsequent battle. Maverick next sought to kill Sabretooth, who was in the midst of a psychotic murderous rampage following the death of Birdy. First seeking Wolverine to aid him in this goal, he reluctantly aids the X-Men in merely capturing Sabretooth, setting in motion what became a failed attempt by Charles Xavier to rehabilitate the serial killer.X-Men Unlimited #3 =Legacy Virus= Maverick swiftly contracted the Legacy Virus. This development brought about the random return of his powers but also a loss of energy and horrible scarring all over his body. He tried to convince Wolverine to kill him, but Wolverine refused. Maverick decided to make the best of it, and \\"fight the good fight.\\"Wolverine #87 His health declining, he travelled the world from safe house to safe house, using his savings to procure treatment for his infection. During this time, he recruited a very unstable Wolverine to help him rescue Deadpool. Maverick was attacked by a group led by Slayback at his Manhattan safe house. Maverick managed to escape to the X-Mansion and spent several hours in a coma. After coming to, Maverick revealed that he and Deadpool had been targeted because both were mutants with healing factors taken from Wolverine's DNA template. Maverick felt they would soon come for Wolverine directly. Deadpool was being experimented on in an attempt to create a cure for the Legacy Virus. Maverick and Wolverine located and rescued Deadpool. It was later discovered by Beast that Deadpool's body could not generate a cure.Wolverine Annual(September, 1995) While in New York, he saved a fellow Legacy Virus-positive mutant, teenager Chris Bradley and his family from an attack by the Friends of Humanity. The FOH retaliated by firebombing Bradley's home, spurring Maverick to use his connections to relocate the Bradley family to Florida under aliases. He also got Chris medical treatment and set his parents up with new jobs.X-Men Unlimited #15 He then left for Canada. While there, former KGB agent and mutant telepath Elena Ivanova found him, demanding he helps her track down Sabretooth, who had killed her mother during his Weapon X years. Before he could answer her, they were attacked by Omega Red, who had tracked Ivanova to Maverick in hopes of recovering the carbonadium synthesizer. With the help of John Wraith, they succeeded in keeping the device away from the villain.Maverick:In the Shadow of Death Ivanova felt that she owed Maverick and stuck by his side, despite his icy demeanor. They travelled together for a time. The Legacy Virus then took hold, killing North. Ivanova used her powers to resuscitate him. To their surprise, the virus seemingly went into remission, all of his wounds from the virus were healed. His powers not only returned but were enhanced. Also, Weapon X's memory implants were cleared from his mind. He would later realize that the Legacy Virus made his new powers inconsistent, at times making them a danger to himself. Immediately, trouble found them in the form of Russian mob boss Ivan Pushkin, who sent his enforcers Hammer and Sickle to abduct them.Maverick #1 Pushkin used Ivanova's powers in an attempt to brainwash Maverick into killing Major Arthur Barrington by making him believe it was Barrington who had set up Barsalini's betrayal all those years ago. In reality, Barrington was to deliver testimony at an inquest that would have been damaging to Pushkin's business interests. Attacking but not killing Barrington, Maverick quickly regained his senses. While he blinded the left eye of Sickle with his own weapon, Hammer killed Barrington.Maverick #2-3 Meanwhile, Chris Bradley ran away from home, missing his girlfriend in New York. The FOH tapped his friends' phone and when he reached New York, they again tried to kill Chris. Maverick, Ivanova, and Wolverine saved him and his friend. Ivanova then used her abilities to make the FOH and Chris' girlfriend think he'd died in the scuffle. Both shaken by the life-threatening events of the past few days, Ivanova and North's relationship, platonic up to this point, became physical.Maverick #4 The following morning, Ivanova still expressed the desire to go after Sabretooth. Maverick harshly warned that an assault against Sabretooth was a fool's errand, and implied she'd slept with him to coerce him to aid her goal. Angered, Ivanova left Maverick that night to continue her vendetta. A regretful Maverick traced Ivanova's steps and found her as she was rendered comatose by Sabretooth's assault. Maverick stopped Sabretooth from delivering the killing blow and left a badly injured Ivanova in the care of the Bradley family.Maverick #5-7 Maverick then renewed his vendetta with Ivan Pushkin, desperate to avenge Barrington's death. Pushkin captured Maverick, hoping to coerce Maverick to work for him. Maverick, however, freed himself and ruined Pushkin's attempted theft of a payload of A.I.M. weaponry. In the midst of this, Sickle gained a measure of revenge by gouging out Maverick's left eye and stranding him in the Swiss Alps Maverick #8-12. =Agent Zero= The Weapon X project was soon reinvigorated and having brought Sabretooth and Wraith back into the fold, they were sent to recruit Maverick. Wraith lured an unwitting Maverick into a rendezvous. Maverick refused to join, and a fierce battle ensued. Sabretooth caught Maverick off guard, impaling him in the chest then throwing him off the roof of a 20-story building and onto the street below.Wolverine #166 Agent Zero's anti-healing factor corrosive. Taken to Weapon X near death, Malcolm Colcord again offered him the chance to join, as he could still be saved. This time, he reluctantly agreed, rationalizing it by saying he couldn't \\"fight the good fight\\" as a corpse. He was healed and then upgraded with the explicit intent of assassinating Wolverine. He has no scent, makes no sound thanks to a vibranium suit, possesses an enhanced healing factor, and a corrosive was added to his concussive blasts that hinder a foes' healing factor. In addition, he was equipped with a wide array of weapons, from wrist-mounted plasma blasters to an adamantium-coated knife. The world believed that North was dead, and he sought to keep it that way. He dyed his brown hair black and adopted the new alias Agent Zero. After sending him on a few simple missions, Colcord tried to break his will by sending him to kill Wolverine, a mission he purposely botched. Feeling guilty for joining the enemy, he contemplated suicide daily. His hatred for his teammate Sabretooth still ran deep, as he tried yet again to kill him, only to be stopped from dealing a fatal blow by the Director. During a mission, Agent Zero encountered a new Maverick, who unbeknownst to Zero, was Chris Bradley. Bradley had infiltrated a mutant terrorist group called Gene Nation in an effort to destroy them from inside. Bradley had wanted revenge on Weapon X for 'killing' North. To achieve that goal, he received training in black ops from Cable and assumed the Maverick mantle. Zero, believing this new Maverick was a terrorist, shot and killed him, only to find the truth as Bradley lay dying. Returning to the base after this occurred, Zero found Weapon X had disappeared without a trace. Zero then picked up Bradley's fight, attacking Gene Nation strongholds across the world and also searched for answers as to what happened to the program.Weapon X #21 It was revealed that Zero doesn't know what happened to Weapon X was because he was being brainwashed by Mesmero as Zero had become increasingly harder to control. Zero had gone after Gene Nation because of Weapon X's instruction. Without realizing it, Zero served as executioner at Neverland, a mutant concentration camp set up by Weapon X. But as soon as Weapon X bothered to reveal these truths, they put him under again, and Zero went on, none the wiser.Weapon X: Days of Future Now #3 =Decimation= Agent Zero lost his powers on M-Day, as a result of Scarlet Witch's actions during the House of M. It has been revealed that he is among the mutants who have been depowered. North is seen residing in a center for former mutants and once again using the Maverick alias.Wolverine: Origins #6 Wolverine sought him out for information on carbonadium, reuniting the two and Jubilee. However, Omega Red soon attacked the building, looking for the carbonadium synthesizer. Maverick stole Weapon X files and sold them on the black market. In an effort to cover up his involvement in Kick-starting the Strikeforce X program from Wolverine, he killed the man to whom he sold the files.Wolverine: Weapon X #1-5 Still going by the program name, Agent Zero, Nord went back to mercenary work and was petitioned by an unknown intelligence agency to take down Doctor Doom after the Latverian overlord was framed for a terrorist attack by a rogue splinter cell flying his banner.Doctor Doom #1-2 Powers and abilities North's primary mutant power is an ability to absorb the kinetic energy generated by an impact without harm to himself. While there are limits to this power, North is able to survive falls from tremendous heights, energy blasts, and being struck by superhumanly strong foes without being injured. Upon accepting his first offer to work for the Weapon X Program, North is artificially granted a slight healing factor that allows him to recover from mild to moderate injuries much faster than a normal human. It also renders him immune to most diseases and toxins and also greatly suppressed his natural aging process. However, after contracting the Legacy Virus, his kinetic absorption ability is dramatically reduced in efficiency and his healing factor burns itself out while fighting the virus. After the virus claims his life and he is resuscitated by Elena Ivanova, the Legacy Virus immediately goes into remission and his kinetic absorption ability mutates. After absorbing energy, North must release the energy in the forms of powerful concussive, AoE (area of effect) or heat blasts. He can also channel the energy into his physical attacks, increasing impact force from his punches and kicks to superhuman levels. After being forced to join the Weapon X Program once again, North's regenerative aspects were restored along with having his kinetic absorption ability artificially tempered. Now, aside from channeling the energy to increase the strength of his physical attacks and discharge ranged blasts of kinetic energy, North's fingertips carry a corrosive enzyme secreted through the skin that carried over into his force discharges. Aside from its acidic properties, the enzyme is specifically designed by the Weapon X Program to counteract the effects of an opponent's self-healing capabilities by reversing the process. The more an enemy's body attempts to fix and/or mend itself from injuries sustained, the worse injuries become thanks to the specialized enzyme. As a side effect of the procedure used to grant him this ability, Agent Zero's body now possesses no discernible scent to track. Currently, North possesses no superhuman powers. Like most of the world's mutant population, North has lost his mutant powers following the events of M-Day.New Avengers #18 =Skills and equipment= North is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant and covert operative. He is also an expert marksman, skilled in the use of virtually all types of firearms. He has also worn a variety of uniforms over the course of his career. The costume he has worn for most of his mercenary career as Maverick is a suit of body armor consisting of lightweight fiberglass armor plating, a padded kevlar lining,X-Men Unlimited #3, and airtight seals or shields that allow him to seal the suit for further protection.Maverick #6 His mask contained a limited oxygen supply as well as infrared scanning and targeting systems. The suit also harnessed a booster pack that could magnify the kinetic energy his body absorbed.Maverick #7 Canadian inventor Isabel Ferguson is the primary source of his specialized gear. As Agent Zero, North wears a body armor woven from vibranium, rendering him completely silent as he moves. It also refracts light which renders him practically invisible to conventional detection methods in total darkness. North has carried a wide array of weaponry including, but not limited to: thermite bombs, hydraulic bolt guns, titanium bullets, wrist- mounted projectile tasers, wrist-mounted plasma blasters, adamantium bullets, anti-metal bullets, and an adamantium-coated knife. Other versions =Exiles= An alternate version of Maverick was revealed to exist in Exiles #62. Maverick was forced to join Weapon X, a group of reality-hopping people who had to kill people in order to save realities. Little is known about Maverick, except that he apparently was killed by the bladed shield of an alternate version of Captain America. For a time, the body was trapped in the Timebroker's Crystal Palace until the Exiles sent his body back home. On his homeworld of Earth-1287, Maverick was revealed to be an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. before his abduction, working alongside Nick Fury, who later honored his best agent by giving him a proper funeral. =Earth-5700= In a possible future timeline (Earth-5700), Agent Zero joined a Wolverine-led version of the X-Men, teaming with Archangel, Juggernaut, Sunfire, Mystique, Aurora, and Deadpool. After a time, the Director activated Zero's embedded mental directive, and Zero, against his will, slaughtered the X-Men, except for Wolverine. Unable to bring himself to kill his friend and teammate, he fought the mind control just long enough to commit suicide. In other media =Television= Maverick (left) and Silver Fox as seen in the X-Men 1990s cartoon. * Maverick appeared in the 1990s X-Men cartoon. In the episode \\"Weapon X, Lies, and Videotape\\", he searches for answers about his past and his involvement with Weapon X, teaming with Wolverine, Sabretooth, Beast and Silver Fox to take down the robot Talos. In the episode \\"Whatever It Takes\\", Morph briefly turns into Maverick to taunt Wolverine, and Maverick also appears in flashbacks that depict himself and Wolverine battling Omega Red (although that memory could be one of Weapon X's implanted memories). * In X-Men Evolution, Omega Red tells Wolverine of having a vendetta against Wolverine, Sabretooth, and Maverick which Wolverine does not recall. * Maverick appears in Wolverine and the X-Men, voiced by Crispin Freeman. This version's only power is kinetic absorption but he is also the father of Christie Nord, a mutant with geokinesis. In the episode \\"Past Discretions\\", he primarily appears in a flashback as a target for Wolverine and Sabretooth. Although he is presumed deceased, he was captured and brainwashed with his memories were removed by Weapon X. In the episode \\"Stolen Lives\\", Maverick is sent to abduct Kristie, causing Wolverine to team-up with Mystique. Like Wolverine's recruitment for Weapon X, the majority of his memories have been permanently erased, however, Emma Frost restores his memories and then he reunites with his daughter. =Film= Daniel Henney as Agent Zero in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. * Agent Zero appears in the film X-Men Origins: Wolverine, played by Daniel Henney. Depicted as Asian in ethnicity, he is a superhumanly accurate sniper/assassin and William Stryker's second in command of Team X. He and Victor Creed are the only ones from Team X that stayed faithful to Stryker. When Wolverine breaks out from the Weapon X facility, Zero pursues him to an old barn belonging to an elderly couple who have taken Wolverine in. Zero kills the couple and orders a helicopter strike to kill Wolverine. When Wolverine gets away on a motorcycle, Zero pursues in the helicopter which Wolverine eventually causes to crash. After mocking Wolverine about how \\"good, innocent people tend to die around [him]\\", Wolverine ignites a trail of fuel with his own claws that cause the helicopter to explode, presumably killing Zero who is still inside. Zero was also allegedly the one who told Fred Dukes and John Wraith about Stryker and Victor working together and hunting down mutants. This version of the character is depicted as being exceptionally ruthless, killing several innocent civilians over the course of the film in order to complete his mission. Agent Zero, in fact, refers to himself as a soldier at heart. His powers in the film are enhanced reflexes, agility, and superhuman accuracy with firearms. Producer Lauren Shuler Donner says on the DVD commentary that Agent Zero has no scent and that a sequence was planned that he escapes the crash and Logan cuts down the forest to stop him. The character is repeatedly referred to as Zero rather than using his given name. =Video games= * Maverick is briefly mentioned in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance. * Agent Zero appears in the X-Men Origins: Wolverine video game adaptation, voiced by Robert Wu. He hunts Wolverine after the latter escapes the facility that bonded the adamantium into the skeleton. At one point, he attempts to take Wolverine out with a sniper rifle. Wolverine manages to take down his helicopter and kills Nord by stabbing him in the stomach with the claws. His name in the game is David Nord.

He served on the board of the National Gallery of Australia. Early life Gleeson was born in the Sydney district of Hornsby in 1915 and attended East Sydney Technical College from 1934 to 1936. In 1938 Gleeson studied at Sydney Teachers College, where he gained two years training in general primary school teaching. Salvador Dal√≠, Max Ernst, Andr√© Masson, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung became major influence in Gleeson's work. Work Gleeson's themes generally delved into the subconscious using literary, mythological or religious subject matter. He was particularly interested in Jung's archetypes of the collective unconscious. Jean-Fran√ßois Millet, The Sower (1850), Museum of Fine Arts, Boston In 1944 Gleeson created The sower referencing Jean- Fran√ßois Millet‚Äôs 1850 painting of the same title. Rather than showing a landscape with a conglomerate main figure, Gleeson presents an eerie twentieth-century view of a desolated one. He commented on the work's genesis as a response to the trauma of longtime warfare:During the 1950s and '60s he moved to a more symbolic perspective, notions of human perfectibility. At this time he increasingly fashioned small psychedelic compositions made using the surrealist technique of decalcomania in the background, to suggest a landscape, and finished by adding a fastidiously painted male nude in the foreground. Many of his paintings had homoerotic undertones, something which reflected on Gleeson's own homosexuality. The ideas for these compositions also saw Gleeson move into collage with his Locus Solus series, where he produced a substantial body of work by placing dismembered photographs, magazine illustrations, diagrams and lines of visionary poetry against abstract pools of ink. Since the 1970s Gleeson generally made large scale paintings in keeping with the surrealist inscape genre. The works outwardly resemble rocky seascapes, although in detail the coastline's geological features are found to be made of giant molluscs and threatening crustaceans. In keeping with the Freudian principles of surrealism these grotesque, nightmarish compositions symbolise the inner workings of the human mind. Called 'Psychoscapes' by the artist, they show liquid, solid and air coming together and directly allude to the interface between the conscious, subconscious and unconscious mind. Gleeson's later works incorporate the human form less and less in its entirety. The human form was then represented in his landscapes by suggestions, an arm, a hand or merely an eye. In the late 1970s, Gleeson interviewed 98 Australian artists in their studios, about their work being acquired by the National Gallery. The informal conversations explore how works were made and then acquired. Gleeson was a visiting curator of Australian art at the time of the interviews, and then chairman of the Gallery's Acquisitions Committee from 1974 to 1975. The interviews were commissioned by the Gallery's director, James Mollison, in order to collect more information for the Gallery's Research Library collection. The original tapes, transcripts, photographs and digitised recordings are held by the Gallery's Library. In 2008, the James Gleeson Oral History Collection's significance was recognised by it being inscribed into the UNESCO Australian Memory of the World Register. The inscription was announced at the program's conference, Communities and Memories: A Global Perspective in Canberra. His retrospective in 2004-2005, Beyond the Screen of Sight, included 120 paintings and was exhibited in Melbourne and Canberra. The Art Gallery of New South Wales exhibited Gleeson's drawings for paintings in 2003 and The Ubu diptych in 2005 to celebrate Gleeson's 90th birthday. The Ubu diptych is regarded as one of his greatest. In September 2007, the largest collection of Australian surrealism ever collected was donated to the National Gallery of Australia by Ray Wilson. The collection included various works by James Gleeson.\\"Gallery gift promises a surreal experience\\", The Age, 28 September 2007, p.3  Death  Gleeson died in Sydney on 20 October 2008, aged 92.

Biography William Fergusson son of James Fergusson of Lochmaben, Dumfriesshire, was born at Prestonpans, East Lothian on 20 March 1808, and was educated first at Lochmaben and afterwards at the high school and University of Edinburgh. At the age of fifteen he was placed by his own desire in a lawyer's office, but the work proved uncongenial, and at seventeen he exchanged law for medicine, in accordance with his father's original wishes. He became an assiduous pupil of Dr. Robert Knox the anatomist, who was much pleased with a piece of mechanism which Fergusson constructed, and appointed him at the age of twenty demonstrator to his class of four hundred pupils. In 1828 Fergusson became a licentiate, and in 1829 a fellow of the Edinburgh College of Surgeons. He continued zealous in anatomy, often spending from twelve to sixteen hours a day in the dissecting-room. Two of his preparations, admirably dissected, are still preserved in the museum of the Edinburgh College of Surgeons. Soon after qualifying Fergusson began to deliver a portion of the lectures on general anatomy, in association with Knox, and to demonstrate surgical anatomy. In 1831 he was elected surgeon to the Edinburgh Royal Dispensary, and in that year tied the subclavian artery, which had then been done in Scotland only twice. On 10 October 1833 he married Helen, daughter and heiress of William Ranken of Spittlehaugh, Peeblesshire. This marriage placed him in easy circumstances, but he did not relax his efforts after success in operative surgery, and by 1836, when he was elected surgeon to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, he shared with James Syme the best surgical practice in Scotland. In 1840 Fergusson accepted the professorship of surgery at King's College London, with the surgeoncy to King's College Hospital, and established himself at Dover Street, Piccadilly, whence he removed in 1847 to 16 George Street, now St George's Street, Hanover Square. He became M.R.C.S. Engl. in 1840, and fellow in 1844. His practice grew rapidly, and the fame of his operative skill brought many students and visitors to King's College Hospital. In 1849 he was appointed surgeon in ordinary to the prince consort, and in 1855 surgeon extraordinary, and in 1867 sergeant-surgeon to the queen. For many years Fergusson was the leading operator in London. He was elected as president for two years of the Pathological Society of London in 1859. He was elected to the council of the College of Surgeons in 1861, examiner in 1867, and was president of the college in 1870. As professor of human anatomy and surgery he delivered two courses of lectures before the College of Surgeons in 1864 and 1865, which were afterwards published. He was president of the British Medical Association in 1873. In 1875, he received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Edinburgh University. He resigned the professorship of surgery at King's College in 1870, but until his death was clinical professor of surgery and senior surgeon to King's College Hospital. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society. He was created a baronet on 23 January 1866, an honour which led to his receiving a presentation from three hundred old pupils, consisting of a silver dessert service worth ¬£400, at the annual dinner of old King's College men on 21 June 1866. Burial vault of William Fergusson in St. Andrews Kirkyard at West Linton He died in London after an exhausting illness, of Bright's disease, on 10 February 1877, and was buried at West Linton, Peeblesshire, where his wife had been buried in 1860. A portrait of Fergusson by Lehmann, painted by subscription, was presented to the London College of Surgeons in 1874, and a replica is in the Edinburgh College of Surgeons. Assessment Fergusson's reputation is that of a brilliant operator and a great \\"conservative\\" surgeon. The term conservative surgery, first applied by Fergusson in 1852 to operations for the preservation of parts of the body which would otherwise have been sacrificed, does not denote merely operations which he originated or improved, for James Syme had already been very successful in this line of procedure. But Fergusson extended the principle from the operation of excision of the elbow joint to many others. No portion of the body which could be usefully preserved was too small for him to make efforts to save. Among operations with which his name is specially identified are those for harelip and cleft palate, and operations on the jaws, the excision of joints, notably the hip, knee, and elbow, lithotomy and lithotrity, and amputations of limbs. His skill in dissection, and his careful study of the actions of the muscles which he had to cut through, were of essential importance to his success. In his lectures at the College of Surgeons he was able to speak of three hundred successful operations of his own for harelip. The operation for cleft palate had been largely abandoned till he took it up anew. His manipulative and mechanical skill was shown both in his modes of operating, and in the new instruments he devised. The bulldog forceps, the mouth-gag for cleft palate, and various bent knives attest his ingenuity. A still higher mark of his ability consisted in his perfect planning of every detail of an operation beforehand; no emergency was unprovided for. Thus, when an operation had begun, he proceeded with remarkable speed and silence till the end, himself applying every bandage and plaster, and leaving, as far as possible, no traces of his operation. So silently were most of his operations conducted, that he was often imagined to be on bad terms with his assistants. His punctuality and his hatred of unnecessary waste of time were very marked. As a lecturer, out of the operating theatre, Fergusson did not shine, owing to his reticence and his imperfect command of abstract subjects; although on points of practice he gave excellent instruction. In the operating theatre his remarks on the cases before him were valuable and instructive. To students he was most kind and generous. He had to sustain much opposition, especially from Syme, but he did not imitate his opponent's mode of controversy; and if on any occasion he imagined he had said or done something to hurt another's feelings, he never rested till he had made reparation in some form. Fergusson was an excellent carpenter, rivalling skilled artisans. When a student he made himself a brass- bound dissecting case, and in 1834 completed a lithotrite, with a novel rack and pinion, which he used throughout life. He was a good violinist, an expert fly-fisher, and very fond of the drama. His endurance was remarkable; he never seemed tired, and scarcely had a day's illness till attacked by Bright's disease. He was tall, dignified, and of good presence, of genial though keen expression, fond of a joke, and very hospitable. He rendered gratuitous aid to large numbers of clergymen, actors, authors, and governesses. He helped many of his pupils in starting in life, a large number of whom attained eminence as surgeons. He never forgot the face of a pupil. In some expressions of opinion Fergusson was ill-advised, especially in matters requiring more knowledge of physiology and hygiene than he possessed. His evidence before the royal commission on vivisection, and his relations with homeopathic practitioners, which he was led to modify, are instances of this. But his faults were faults of sympathy, not of self-conceit or intolerance of criticism. Family On 10 October 1833, Fergusson married Helen Hamilton Ranken, daughter and heiress of William Ranken of Spittlehaugh, Peeblesshire. They had two sons: Sir James Ranken Fergusson (eldest son and heir) and Charles Hamilton (who would eventually rise to the rank of major in the army), and three daughters.

'Flags - Changing the flag', Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 18-Mar-13 Overview As black is a traditional colour of the MƒÅori, the flag has a black strip on the left side. There is a fern green spiral which starts by taking up the entire width of the flag but decreases gradually, splitting it diagonally and finally curling up into a spiral on the right side. This curling fern is based on a MƒÅori pattern known as the koru, and the corresponding white spiral alludes to Aotearoa, a MƒÅori name for New Zealand meaning Land of the Long White Cloud. Hundertwasser also saw the design as representing humanity in harmony with nature. It is claimed by some New Zealanders that the current flag of New Zealand is a reminder of British colonialism and does not truly represent their culture; however, those who support the current flag say that it represents the history of the country as a part of the British Empire and location in the southern hemisphere. The flag can be seen on the counter of the convenience store in the 1997 film subUrbia.

Owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., the station covers the Twin Cities radio market, and is the local affiliate for: Fox News Radio and NBC News Radio; The Glenn Beck Radio Program; The Rush Limbaugh Show; The Sean Hannity Show; Coast to Coast AM; and syndicated radio personalities Joe Pags, Bill Cunningham, Kim Komando, Bill Handel and Ben Ferguson. The KTLK main studios are located in St. Louis Park, while the transmitter is located in nearby Scott County. Besides a standard analog transmission, KTLK is simulcast over a HD digital subchannel of KFXN-FM and on low-power Cottage Grove translator K278BP (103.5 FM), and is available online via iHeartRadio. History =Early years= KTLK is the second oldest continuously operating station in Minnesota, dating to December 23, 1923, when Dr. George W. Young signed on his station with the call letters KFMT. (KUOM began operation in 1922.) Dr. Young first operated the station from his house in Minneapolis at 2219 Bryant Ave. North, cycling through the call signs: WHAT, WGWY (\\"W-George W. Young\\"), and finally WDGY (\\"W-Dr. George Young\\") in the next two years until being chastised by the government for changing too frequently. The station kept the WDGY call letters until 1991. WDGY operated on eight frequencies over its early years. In the 1930s, it was heard on 1180 AM, powered in those years at 5,000 watts by day and 1,000 watts at night.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 38 The station shared time with at least four local stations, including WRHM and WCAL during its early years. After moving out of his home, Young located the station's studios at several locations: his storefront at 909 West Broadway in Minneapolis, the West Hotel on Hennepin at 5th Street and 609 South Second Avenue. Minnesota native George Putnam began his broadcasting career at WDGY in 1934. Putnam later gained fame as a Los Angeles television news anchor and talk show host. In 1938, WDGY relocated its studios to the Nicollet Hotel, on Nicollet Avenue at Washington Avenue, where WCCO had previously housed its studios before moving to a new building on Second Avenue. =Move to 1130 AM= WDGY made its final move on the dial to 1130 AM in 1941 as required by the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), under which most American, Canadian and Mexican AM radio stations changed frequencies.Broadcasting Yearbook 1943 page 106 Transmitter sites are known to have been at Young's house, at the Broadway address and from 1927 to 1949 at Superior Boulevard and Falvey Cross Road in St. Louis Park on the grounds of a fox farm. Dr. Young's died on April 27, 1945. Later studio locations included Bloomington (two locations), 611 Frontenac Place in St. Paul and, in 2004 at the Clear Channel Communications consolidated offices in St. Louis Park at 1600 Utica Avenue. The transmitter site moved in 1949 to Bloomington at a site that would within a decade overlook I-35W, using a vast 9-tower array. =TV experiments= In 1933, Dr. Young was granted a license for W9XAT, an experimental mechanical television station that is credited with the first telecast in Minnesota. It is believed that the first transmission of the 120- or 125-line system occurred on August 4 of that year, featuring a handshake between WDGY station personality Clellan Card and Minneapolis mayor William Kunze. The station pushed the technological limits of the day and provided a lot of interesting exercises for WDGY engineers, but Dr. Young never got into regular broadcasts. The license for that station expired in 1938, partly because mechanical television development was discouraged by that point. After 64 years of dormancy, an amateur radio group in the area acquired the W9XAT call sign in 2002 with the intention of using it for mechanical and narrow-bandwidth TV experiments. Nine years after the 1945 death of Dr. Young, WDGY in 1954 flirted with modern TV, applying for Channel 9 in the Twin Cities. Also applying were competing radio stations WLOL and KEYD. WDGY and WLOL withdrew their applications at the last minute and the new station was awarded to KEYD, going on the air in January 1955, today KMSP- TV. =Top 40= The station was one of the first stations in the country to program rock and roll music full-time, starting a Top 40 format in 1956. It was then owned by Todd Storz, one of the pioneers in programming to the baby boom generation with some of its music rarely heard on \\"white\\" radio stations. Storz's stations were heavy on promotion, headline-grabbing contests, and high-profile disc jockeys, using echo-chamber voice processing. Other Twin Cities station owners resented the attention WDGY received, but several jumped on the Top 40 bandwagon. Storz is credited with energizing radio at a time when network programming was moving to television. WDGY gained the nickname Weegee after a time, a sounding out of the call letters. By the 1960s, the station didn't use the name itself, but the name stuck among people in the radio industry. From about 1955 to 1977, WDGY competed for youthful listeners with AM stations KSTP and KDWB, though WCCO remained the top station in the Twin Cities, with a mixture of middle of the road music (MOR), talk, news, sports and farm reports. =Country music= As the 1970s ended, young listeners began switching to the FM band to hear contemporary music. That prompted WDGY to change to a country music format.Broadcasting Yearbook 1980 page C-121 The only other stations playing country in Minneapolis were KTCR, AM 690 and FM 97.1. The AM was a daytimer powered at only 500 watts and the FM's tower was only 150 feet tall, limiting both stations in coverage area. In 1982, WDGY's sister FM station, 102.1 KEEY, flipped to a country format as well. The AM station specialized in personality and several decades of country music, while the FM kept chatter to a minimum and played mostly contemporary country hits. In 1984, WDGY and KEEY were acquired by the Malrite Communications Group. =Talk and sports= The country format continued until April 16, 1990, when the station became \\"News Talk 1130, WDGY.\\"Broadcasting Yearbook 1991 page B-176 Just prior to this, WDGY became the inaugural flagship station for the expansion Minnesota Timberwolves NBA team. The talk format gradually added more sports programming until the station had switched to full-time sports talk. The call letters were changed to KFAN in 1991. Following this change, the WDGY call letters were moved to the 630 kHz frequency, which was formerly KDWB (now WREY). In 2000, WDGY and KEEY were acquired by Clear Channel Communications, the forerunner to current owner iHeartMedia.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2002-2003 page D-240 KFAN's logo under previous sports format KFAN experienced severe storm damage in April 2004 at its transmission site, when four of the nine towers at its directional array in Credit River Township (near Prior Lake, Minnesota) fell down. =Translator station= On August 22, 2010, KFAN's programming began simulcasting on 103.7 FM using translator station K279AZ. The translator broadcast from a tower atop the IDS Center. It previously was owned by the Educational Media Foundation, which used the signal to broadcast its K-LOVE Christian contemporary network prior to the translator's move from Cottage Grove. Within weeks of the upgrade, however, complaints were filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) by listeners of KLZZ (\\"the Loon\\") in St. Cloud, also at 103.7 FM. Because translators are a secondary service, a translator's owner must either immediately fix the problem or shut the translator down. As a result of the interference complaints, on September 24, K279AZ's power was significantly reduced and the translator moved to 103.5 under Special Temporary Authority (STA) from the FCC, and would change call letters to K278BP.http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=K279AZ K279AZ FCC file =Frequency switch= On August 8, 2011, Clear Channel Communications announced a two-way frequency swap flipping KFAN and KTLK-FM. On Monday, August 15, 2011, KTLK-FM's talk format moved to AM 1130, while KFAN's sports programming moved to KTLK-FM's format spot on the dial, 100.3 FM. FM listeners in Minneapolis, St. Paul and adjacent communities would be able to hear KTLK on FM, by listening to the translator station on 102.5 MHz (though this would later change to the aforementioned K279AZ).Make the Switch: News Talk Moves to 102.5 FM! =KTLK-FM= In 2006, Clear Channel Communications decided to launch a talk radio station in the Twin Cities, in order to take advantage of its Premiere Radio Networks syndication arm and the company's recent launch of Fox News Radio. Clear Channel informed AM 1500 KSTP that it would not renew its contract to carry The Rush Limbaugh Show and it eventually did the same with KSTP's carriage of Sean Hannity. (After losing Limbaugh and Hannity, KSTP shortly switched to a Sports radio format.) Clear Channel decided to put a talk format using these and other Premiere Network hosts on one of its Twin Cities FM signals, choosing to discontinue smooth jazz on 100.3 FM. On January 2, 2006, the company switched KJZI to talk, becoming the second commercial FM talk station in the area after female-oriented talk station WFMP. The new call letters on 100.3 were KTLK-FM. When KFAN and KTLK swapped formats and frequencies in August 2011, the KTLK call sign, however, did not move to 1130 because the KTLK call letters were already on an sister station in Los Angeles. Clear Channel instead chose the call sign KTCN for 1130. In early 2014, the Los Angeles station switched to the call letters KEIB, with 1130 adopting the KTLK calls on January 8, 2014. The call sign KTCN is now on a station in Rochester, Minnesota. The current call letters KTLK previously belonged to the current KBZO in Lubbock, Texas. In the spring of 2008, former KTLK News Director Jeff Monosso was honored with U.S. Congressional recognition for his reporting on the 35W Bridge collapse. He and former host Jason Lewis were also honored by the Minnesota Associated Press for best spot news coverage. Programming KTLK personalities Jon Justice and Andrew Lee host the morning-drive program, Justice and Drew; The Glenn Beck Radio Program, The Rush Limbaugh Show and The Sean Hannity Show (all via Premiere Networks) air in the late morning, midday and afternoon periods, respectively. A local evening program, Closing Argument, is hosted by KTLK personalities Brad Omland and Walter Hudson. A syndicated show hosted by Joe Pags (via Compass Media Networks), Coast to Coast AM (via Premiere) and This Morning, America's First News with Gordon Deal (via Compass Media) round out the weekday lineup. Weekend syndicated shows include Ben Ferguson, Bill Cunningham, Kim Kommando and Bill Handel.

Life Brodkey was the second child born in Staunton, Illinois, to Max Weintraub and Celia Glazer Weintraub (1899-1932); Samuel Weintraub (1928-2017) was their oldest child. When their birth mother Celia died, Samuel Weintraub was four and old enough to remain with his father but Aaron Weingtraub, only two years old, was adopted by his father's cousin, Doris Rubenstein Brodkey (1896-1949) and her husband, Joseph Brodkey (1896-1946) and renamed Harold Roy Brodkey. Doris and Joseph lived in University City, Missouri, with their daughter, Marilyn Ruth Brodkey (1923-2011). Brodkey would chronicle his life with his adoptive parents and sister in his short stories and his novel, The Runaway Soul. After graduating from Harvard University with an A.B. cum laude in 1952, Brodkey married his first wife, Joanna Brown, a Radcliffe graduate and, in 1953 their only child, Ann Emily Brodkey was born. With the aid of his editor, William Maxwell, a childhood friend of his wife, Brodkey began his writing career by contributing short stories to The New Yorker and other magazines. His stories received two first-place O. Henry Awards. Brodkey was a staff writer for The New Yorker until the end of his life. In 1993 he announced in The New Yorker that he had contracted AIDS; he later wrote This Wild Darkness: The Story of My Death (1996), about his battle with the disease. At the time of his death in 1996, he was living in New York City with his second wife, novelist Ellen Brodkey (n√©e Schwamm). Brodkey contracted the HIV virus from a homosexual relationship, though he reportedly did not consider himself to be gay. The author is most famous for his breathtaking conversational skills, his progressively more complex text and for taking 32 years to complete his much anticipated first novel, published in 1991 as The Runaway Soul.  Literary career  Brodkey's career began promisingly with the short-story collection First Love and Other Sorrows, which received widespread critical praise at the time of its 1958 publication. Six years later he signed a book contract with Random House for his first novel, tentatively titled \\"A Party of Animals\\" (it was also referred to as \\"The Animal Corner\\"). The unfinished novel was subsequently resold to Farrar, Straus & Giroux in 1970, then to Knopf in '79. As a Paris Review interview noted, \\"The work became something of an object of desire for editors; it was moved among publishing houses for what were rumored to be ever-increasing advances, advertised as a forthcoming title (Party of Animals) in book catalogs, expanded and ceaselessly revised, until its publication seemed an event longer awaited than anything without theological implications.\\"Paris Review, Winter, 1991. In 1983 the Saturday Review referred to \\"A Party of Animals\\" as \\"now reportedly comprising 4,000 pages and announced as forthcoming 'next year' every year since 1973.\\"Saturday Review (U.S. magazine), December 1983. During this period, Brodkey published a number of stories, most of them in The New Yorker, that dealt with a set of recurring characters‚Äîthe evidently autobiographical Wiley Silenowicz and his adoptive family‚Äîand which were announced as fragments of the novel. His editor at Knopf, Gordon Lish, called the novel in progress \\"the one necessary American narrative work of this century.\\"Newsweek, November 18, 1991. Literary critic Harold Bloom declared: \\"If he's ever able to solve his publishing problems, he'll be seen as one of the great writers of his day.\\"Time, November 25, 1991. In addition to publishing, Brodkey earned a living during this period by writing television pilot scripts for NBC, and teaching at Cornell University. Three long stories from \\"A Party of Animals\\" were collected in Women and Angels (1985), and a larger number, including those three, appeared in 1988's Stories in an Almost Classical Mode. Brodkey had apparently decided to omit them from the novel, for when, in 1991, he published The Runaway Soul, a very long novel (835 pages) dramatizing Wiley's early life, no material from Stories in an Almost Classical Mode was included. The novel seems to be either \\"A Party of Animals\\" under a new title or the first volume of an eventual multivolume work. Brodkey made some comments that suggested the latter. Brodkey's second novel, Profane Friendship, appeared in 1994. Criticism From the beginning of his career, Brodkey accrued detractors. Reviewing First Love for The Christian Science Monitor, Melvin Maddocks wrote that \\"a sense of vital, untampered-with conflict is missing. These stories seem too patly, too cautiously worked out. They are Japanese-garden fiction with every pebble in place.\\" A critic for The Atlantic Monthly similarly complained that Brodkey \\"appears to be the kind of artist committed to working in the minor key which The New Yorker has made fashionable.\\" Kirkus Reviews called Stories in an Almost Classical Mode an \\"endless kvetch.\\"\\"an endless kvetch\\". https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/harold-brodkey-2/stories-in-an- almost-classical-mode/#review In The New Criterion, Bruce Bawer found the book's tone to be \\"extraordinarily arrogant and self-obsessed.\\" He further wrote, \\"Brodkey is so fixated upon the tragic memories of his childhood and youth that he has virtually no sense of proportion about them. In one story after another, he offers up pages of gratuitous detail, straining, it seems, to squeeze every last drop of significance out of every last inane particular.\\" Later, in assessing The Runaway Soul, Bawer wrote, \\"The plain fact is that 99 percent of the prose here is gawky, aimless, repetitive, murky, and pretentious‚Äîand there are few more unenviable literary experiences than having to read over eight hundred pages of it.\\" He concluded that the novel was \\"one of the literary fiascos of all time.\\" \\"Entering The Runaway Soul,\\" wrote Christopher Lehmann-Haupt in The New York Times, \\"is like arriving at a monthlong house party and being accosted at the door by your host, who sticks his mouth in your face and begins to talk.\\" Lehmann-Haupt found the book to be replete with \\"bogus philosophizing\\" and \\"paradoxical non- art,\\" with prose that was \\"verbose, repetitive, overstuffed with adverbs, of questionable sense, tedious and just plain ugly\\". In The American Scholar, Michael Dirda criticized the novel's \\"consummate, unmitigated tedium.\\" https://theamericanscholar.org/a-positively-final-appearance/#.VoEeEShbzzI Regarding This Wild Darkness, Brenda Bracker in The Baltimore Sun criticized the \\"long and self-indulgent stretches of the author's much-touted mystical prose\\" and wrote that \\"watching Brodkey watch himself die by inches becomes, ultimately, tedious.\\" Several weeks after Brodkey announced in The New Yorker in 1993 that he was suffering from AIDS, the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Richard Howard wrote in The New Republic that the disclosure was \\"a matter of manipulative hucksterism, of mendacious self-propaganda and cruel assertion of artistic privilege, whereby death is made a matter of public relations.\\" In reviewing Brodkey's essay collection Sea Battles on Dry Land for The New York Times, Wendy Steiner wrote that although the anthology \\"does contain some very good sentences,\\" others were \\"unspeakable,\\" e.g. \\"'A car simply is too weak and too complex to be a good symbol, since neither does it plow, and it does not weep either.\\" Moreover, \\"Brodkey's philosophizing alternates between deconstruction-rivaling nonsense and delusional pieties.\\" Kirkus Reviews complained that in these \\"self-involved, prolix\\" essays, \\"Brodkey seems to be parodying both himself and The New Yorker.\\" Among the offending examples cited were \\"a superannuated New Journalism style piece on the Academy Awards\\", \\"pompously irrelevant analyses of the 1992 presidential campaign\\" and \\"preciously insubstantial vignettes\\" for The New Yorker's \\"Talk of the Town\\" section. \\"If, for some reason, you consider yourself a New York intellectual, Sea Battles on Dry Land might encourage you to secede from the tribe,\\" wrote Susie Linfield in her review of the book for The New York Observer. \\"When [Brodkey] is bad, he is very, very bad, and he is very, very bad quite often.

The distance to this system has been measured directly using the parallax technique, yielding an estimated from the Sun. Nomenclature Œ≥ Corvi (Latinised to Gamma Corvi) is the system's Bayer designation. The designation of the components ‚Äì Gamma Corvi A and B ‚Äì derives from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Gamma Corvi bore the traditional name of Gienah derived from Arabic, from Ulugh Beg's ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÜÿßÿ≠ ÿßŸÑÿ∫ÿ±ÿßÿ® ÿßŸÑŸäŸÖŸÜ al-janƒÅƒß al-ghirƒÅb al-yaman, meaning \\"the right wing of the crow\\", although on modern charts it marks the left wing. The star Epsilon Cygni also bore this traditional name and Gamma Corvi was referred to as Gienah Corvi or Gienah Ghurab to distinguish it from this star in Cygnus. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Gienah for the component Gamma Corvi A on 6 November 2016 and Aljanah for Epsilon Cygni Aa on 30 June 2017. They are both now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

The spectrum of this star displays an anomalously higher than normal abundance of the elements mercury and manganese, making this a Mercury-manganese star. However, there are other elements that show large over or under abundances. This chemical peculiarity in an otherwise stable stellar atmosphere is most likely caused by separation of the elements through diffusion and gravitational settling. It has a confirmed stellar companion with a mass of about 0.8 times the Sun's, which may be orbiting at a separation of around 50 AU over a 158-year period. The photometry for Gamma Corvi B suggests a stellar classification in the range K5‚ÄìM5 V.

Fitzhugh decried capitalism as practiced by the Northern United States and Great Britain as spawning \\"a war of the rich with the poor, and the poor with one another\\",Fitzhugh (1854), p. 22. rendering free blacks \\"far outstripped or outwitted in the chase of free competition.\\"Fitzhugh (1854), p. 84. Slavery, he contended, ensured that blacks would be economically secure and morally civilized. Nonetheless, some historians consider Fitzhugh‚Äôs worldview to be fascist in its rejection of liberal values, defense of slavery, and perspectives toward race. Fitzhugh practiced law and was a painter for years, but attracted both fame and infamy when he published two sociological tracts for the South. He was a leading pro- slavery intellectualGilpin, Drew Faust (1977).

Before printing books, Fitzhugh tried his hand at a pamphlet, \\"Slavery Justified\\" (1849). His first book, Sociology for the South (1854) was not as widely known as his second book, Cannibals All! (1857). Sociology for the South is the first known English-language book to include the term \\"sociology\\" in its title.Oakwood Cemetery, Walker County Historical Society website; accessed August 27, 2017. Fitzhugh differed from nearly all of his southern contemporaries by advocating a slavery that crossed racial boundaries. In 1860 Fitzhugh stated, \\"It is a libel on white men to say they are unfit for slavery\\" and suggested that if Yankees were caught young they could be trained, domesticated and civilized to make \\"faithful and valuable servants.\\"George Fitzhugh. Horace Greeley and his Lost Book, Southern Literary Messenger Volume 31, Issue 3, 1860. In Sociology for the South, Fitzhugh proclaimed, \\"Men are not 'born entitled to equal rights!' It would be far nearer the truth to say, 'that some were born with saddles on their backs, and others booted and spurred to ride them,' - and the riding does them good.\\"; and that the Declaration of Independence \\"deserves the tumid yet appropriate epithets which Major Lee somewhere applies to the writings of Mr. Jefferson, it is, 'exhuberantly false, and arborescently fallacious.'\\"Sociology for the South, or, the Failure of Free Society, pp. 179, 182. Life George Fitzhugh was born on November 4, 1806, to George Fitzhugh Sr. (a surgeon/physician) and Lucy (n√©e Stuart) Fitzhugh. He was born in Prince William County, Virginia. His family moved to Alexandria, Virginia, when he was six. He attended public school though his career was built on self-education. He married Mary Metcalf Brockenbrough in 1829 and moved to Port Royal, Virginia. There he began his own law business. Fitzhugh took up residence in a \\"rickety old mansion\\" known for a vast collection of bats in its attic that he inherited through his wife's family. He was something of a recluse in this home for most of his life and rarely travelled away from it for extended periods of time, spending most of his days there engaged in unguided reading from a vast library of books and pamphlets. Of the writers in his library, Fitzhugh's beliefs were most heavily influenced by Thomas Carlyle, whom he read frequently and referenced in many of his works.Straka, Gerald M. (1957). \\"The Spirit of Carlyle in the Old South,\\" The Historian 20 (1), pp. 39‚Äì57. Atypical for a slavery advocate, Fitzhugh also subscribed to and regularly read abolitionist pamphlets such as The Liberator. He made only one major visit to other parts of the nation in the entire antebellum period ‚Äì an 1855 journey to the north where he met and argued with abolitionists Gerrit Smith and Wendell Phillips. Never politically active in his own right, Fitzhugh managed to find the company of well known political figures in his day.Hartz, Louis (1955). The Liberal Tradition in America: An Interpretation of American Political Thought Since the Revolution. New York: Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc. In addition to the two abolitionists, Fitzhugh was an acquaintance of several public officials. In 1857 Fitzhugh served as a law clerk in Washington, D.C. under Attorney General Jeremiah Sullivan Black. He gained fairly wide circulation in print, writing articles for several Virginia newspapers and for the widely circulated Southern magazine DeBow's Review.Leland, Charles G. (1862). \\"A Southern Review,\\" The Continental Monthly 2 (4), pp. 466‚Äì469.Skipper, Ottis Clark (1958). J.D.B. De Bow: Magazinist of the old South. Athens, Ga.: University of Georgia Press. After moving to Richmond, Virginia, in 1862 he began to work in the Treasury of the Confederacy. After the Civil War, Fitzhugh spent a short time judging for the Freedmen's Court and then retiring to Kentucky after his wife's death in 1877. He later moved to his daughter's residence in Huntsville, Texas, where he died on July 30, 1881. He is buried in a grave in Oakwood Cemetery, Huntsville, where his daughter, Mariella Fitzhugh Foster and her husband Capt. Marcellus Aurelius Foster are also buried.George Fitzhugh (1806‚Äì1881) Encyclopedia of Virginia website. Contributed by Calvin Schermerhorn and the Dictionary of Virginia Biography Writings =Sociology for the South= Sociology for the South, or, the Failure of Free Society (1854) was George Fitzhugh's most powerful attack on the philosophical foundations of free society. In it, he took on not only Adam Smith,Dodd, William E. (1920). The Cotton Kingdom: A Chronicle of the Old South, Yale University Press, p. 64. the foundational thinker of capitalism, but also John Locke,Loewenberg, Robert (1985). \\"John Locke and the Antebellum Defense of Slavery,\\" Political Theory 13 (2), pp. 266‚Äì291. Thomas Jefferson, and the entire liberal tradition. He argued that free labor and free markets enriched the strong while crushing the weak.Fitzhugh (1854), p. 179. What society needed, he wrote, was slavery, not just for blacks, but for whites as well. \\"Slavery,\\" he wrote, \\"is a form, and the very best form, of socialism.\\"Fitzhugh (1854), pp. 27‚Äì28. \\"Socialism,\\" he continued: > Proposes to do away with free competition; to afford protection and support > at all times to the laboring class; to bring about, at least, a qualified > community of property, and to associate labor. All these purposes, slavery > fully and perfectly attains. ... Socialism is already slavery in all save > the master ... Our only quarrel with Socialism is, that it will not honestly > admit that it owes its recent revival to the failure of universal liberty, > and is seeking to bring about slavery again in some form.Fitzhugh (1854), > pp. 48, 70. Fitzhugh believed that slavery reduced the pressure on the poor and lower classes; in other words, he advocated slavery for poor whites as well as blacks.Craven, Avery (1944). \\"Southern Attitudes Toward Abrahan Lincoln,\\" Papers in Illinois History and Transactions for the year 1942, The Illinois State Historical Society, p. 17. He also strongly opposed the racial doctrines of the time.\\"We abhor the doctrine of the \\"Types of Mankind;\\" first, because it is at war with scripture, which teaches us that the whole human race is descended from a common parentage; and, secondly, because it encourages and incites brutal masters to treat negroes, not as weak, ignorant and dependent brethren, but as wicked beasts, without the pale of humanity. The Southerner is the negro's friend, his only friend. Let no intermeddling abolitionist, no refined philosophy, dissolve this friendship.\\" ‚Äî Fitzhugh (1854), p. 95. =Cannibals All!= Cannibals All!, or Slaves Without Masters (1857) was a critique further developing the themes that Fitzhugh had introduced in Sociology for the South. Both the book's title and its subtitle were phrases taken from the writing of Thomas Carlyle, the Scottish social critic and a great hero to Fitzhugh's generation of proslavery thinkers.Dodd, William E.

The aim of his book, Fitzhugh claimed, was to show that \\"the unrestricted exploitation of so-called free society is more oppressive to the laborer than domestic slavery.\\"Fitzhugh (1857), Preface, p. ix. Cannibals All! was a sharp criticism of the system of \\"wage-slavery\\" found in the north.Persky, Joseph (1992). \\"Unequal Exchange and Dependency Theory in George Fitzhugh,\\" History of Political Economy 24 (1), pp. 117‚Äì128.

Under this same context, Fitzhugh asserted that society was obligated to protect the weak by controlling and subjugating them. Fitzhugh wrote: > 'It is the duty of society to protect the weak;' but protection cannot be > efficient without the power of control; therefore, 'It is the duty of > society to enslave the weak.' Fitzhugh's ideas in Cannibals All!, while often used in the defense of anti- abolition, have a more socially egalitarian undertone which attempted to remedy inequalities in \\"Property of man.\\"Sklansky, Jeffrey P.

The extremes advocated by Fitzhugh's writing led even some of his allies to denounce his bold claims. Cannibals All! garnered more attention in the Liberator, William Lloyd Garrison's abolitionist newspaper, than any other book. Lincoln is said to have been more angered by George Fitzhugh than by any other pro-slavery writer, yet he unconsciously paraphrased Cannibals All! in his House Divided speech.Phillips, Michael (2007). \\"George Fitzhugh (1806-1881).\\" In: Junius P.

Archie Moore, the light-heavyweight champion who was defeated by Burley in a 1944 middleweight bout, was one of several fighters who called Burley the greatest fighter ever. Burley was the penultimate holder of both the World Colored Welterweight Championship and the World Colored Middleweight Championship. Early life He was born Charles Duane Burley in Bessemer, Pennsylvania on September 6, 1917 to a mixed-race couple: his father was a black coal miner and his mother a white Irish immigrant from County Cork. Raised in Bessemer, the only son of seven children, the family moved to Pittsburgh when his father was killed in an industrial accident in 1925. He began boxing at the age of 12 at a Boys Club and, as a lightweight, won city, state and national junior boxing titles and a Golden Gloves junior title. As a welterweight, he won a Golden Gloves Senior and lost the 1936 National Senior Championship finals. That same year, he refused an invitation to participate in the Olympic trials due to his objection to the Nazi regime. He did accept an invitation to attend a scheduled 'Workers Games' to be held in Republican Spain as a protest to the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics, but the games were cancelled by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Burley had also excelled at baseball. He reportedly was offered a contract by the Homestead Grays, the local Negro Leagues franchise. Pro Boxing Career The 5'9 ¬Ω Burley fought at weights between 145 and 162 lbs. He made his pro debut on September 29, 1936, fighting as a welterweight at 150¬æ lbs., at Pittsburgh's Moose Temple. He knocked out George Liggins in the fourth round of a four-round bout. Less than two years later, on August 22, 1938, Burley met the Cocoa Kid at Hickey Park in Millvale, Pennsylvania for the World Colored Welterweight Championship. He won a unanimous decision in the 15-round bout, knocking the Kid to the canvas three times and defeating him decisively, taking his title. Burley did not defend that title, possibly as part of a strategy to win a shot at Henry Armstrong's World Welterweight title. He won the World Colored Middleweight Title in a ninth round technical knockout against Holman Williams at Victory Arena in New Orleans, Louisiana on 14 August 1942. In their rematch for the title two months later at the same venue, Williams won a 15-round decision. Jack Kincaid of the Times-Picayune reported that Burley had won nine rounds of the fight and had been the aggressor throughout. Burley was never granted a world title shot by any of the world welterweight and world middleweight champions of his era and was avoided by many of the top white contenders. Among the fighters who \\"ducked\\" Burley were Hall of Famers Billy Conn (who fought Joe Louis for the heavyweight title), Frenchman Marcel Cerdan (who was supposed to face Burley in his American debut) and even Sugar Ray Robinson, considered by many boxing historians as the best pound-for-pound fighter of all time. Of course, not everyone ducked the slick Pittsburgh warrior. Burley won two out of three matches against future welterweight champion Fritzie Zivic, defeated the great Archie Moore by decision, and easily defeated future NYSAC middleweight king Billy Soose. Burley also faced future heavyweight champion Ezzard Charles, but dropped two 10-round decisions to him (the bouts were contested within a five- week period, sandwiching a fight against Williams). Another notable Burley fight was the one against heavyweight J.D. Turner, who outweighed him by around 70 lbs. \\"Turner, face beaten to raw beefsteak in six rounds, failed to answer the bell for the seventh.\\" (The Ring, June 1942). Burley himself was never stopped in 98 bouts. He compiled a record of 83 wins (50 by knockout) against 12 losses and two draws with 1 \\"no contest\\". He also battled financial problems at times during his career (which is why he's thought to have lost some of the fights he did) and was forced to work as an aircraft mechanic and garbage man in order to earn enough money to live off. Legacy Burley's second fight with Oakland Billy Smith in 1946 is the only known boxing film for him that is known to exist. It shows a conservative counter-puncher taming a much larger opponent with relative ease. Burley's former sparring partner A.J. \\"Blackie\\" Nelson offers this comparison: \\"I see a lot of Charley in this kid, Roy Jones Jr. Both had unorthodox styles, could hit you from any angle, both hard to hit. Charley jabbed more than Jones, if Jones would concentrate on boxing as Charley did, he would become an all-time great.\\" Eddie Futch, the great trainer, called Burley \\"the finest all-around fighter I ever saw.\\" Burley was named to the Ring Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time, elected to the Boxing Hall of Fame in 1983 and the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1992. Burley was ranked 39th on Ring Magazine's list of the 80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years. An exhibit at the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum at Pittsburgh's Senator Heinz History Center states that Burley was the model for the character Troy in August Wilson's play Fences.

Juan Carlos Blumberg (born in 1945) is an Argentine textile entrepreneur and victims' rights advocate who rose to prominence following the 2004 murder of his son, Axel Blumberg. Early life and tragedy Blumberg was born in Avellaneda, Buenos Aires, in a Jewish family of German and Lithuanian background. He enrolled at the National Technological University and pursued a degree in textile engineering, though he reportedly left in 1966 to pursue an interest in traditional Lithuanian dancing. Blumberg publicly referred to himself as an \\"engineer\\" graduate of Reutlingen University (Germany), although a journalistic investigation revealed on 15 June 2007 that this claim was false. Blumberg lost his son Axel Blumberg, an engineering student, after a kidnapping resulted in the latter's murder on March 22, 2004. Argentina was at the time in the midst of a wave of extortion kidnappings, often remaining unsolved after badly conducted investigations; in three cases since 2001, the extortive kidnappings ended in murder: Juan Manuel Canillas, who was killed by his kidnappers in July 2002, Diego Peralta, in August of the same year, and the aforementioned Axel Blumberg, in March 2004. A large portion of Argentine society viewed (and still views) the police forces as corrupt and inefficient, political leaders as non-supportive, and penal laws as excessively lenient; in this context, Axel Blumberg's murder caused an uproar and was the catalyst for massive demonstrations, protesting this perceived impunity and supporting Axel's father in his search for justice. The first such demonstration gathered more than 100,000 people. He was named Humanitarian of the Year by the LatinTrade magazine the same year for his campaign Crusade for Axel. Blumberg as a public figure Juan Carlos Blumberg claimed he wanted justice for his son's murderers, but even more importantly, a working system to ensure that such crimes stopped being common and that criminals were punished. He quickly became a model for victims' suffering families, and a media icon. The latter role brought upon him a large amount of media sentimentalism and sensationalism. Soon he also took a political stance, directly asking for legislators to harden crime laws he saw as sparing certain criminals from rightful punishment. Very soon, right-wing political and ideological leaders took advantage of Blumberg's denunciations to criticize the policies of the national and local governments. Encouraged by this, Blumberg demanded to be received by the legislative chamber of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, and upon being invited, he gave a speech with his proposals. The legislators swiftly passed amendments to the penal laws as requested, which was later criticized as simply pandering to public opinion and introducing unsystematic changes for media effect only. Blumberg's request to the Argentine Senate Finally, Axel Blumberg himself was somehow forgotten by public opinion, and the issue became increasingly politicized. As the wave of kidnappings abated, however, media focus shifted elsewhere. Blumberg's association with traditional right-wing middle class ideology, coupled with his demands and denunciations, have caused him to become unpopular in the eyes of many Argentines. On one occasion he commented that human rights organizations support criminals' human rights, yet they had not supported him in his crusade. This complaint was not well received. When he attended a support demonstration for the people killed in the fire of the Rep√∫blica Cromagnon disco, he found a hostile reception, including shouts accusing him of being \\"a Nazi and a fascist\\". A demonstration organized by Blumberg on March 23, 2005, was only attended by about one thousand people. Blumberg became a political figure as a result of his campaign. He has been courted by Mauricio Macri of the centre-right Commitment to Change party, possibly as a candidate to be governor of Buenos Aires Province for the PRO alliance. Though he presented himself as an engineer, doubts arose in June 2007 about the validity of his degree.\\"Pol√©mica, decepci√≥n: no es ingeniero Blumberg\\" - √Åmbito Financiero and he finally admitted to holding no university title.Las excusas ‚Äúm√°s honestas no pueden ser‚Äù - P√°gina/12 The march on Plaza de Mayo Blumberg led a new march on August 31, 2006, at the Plaza de Mayo. While the organizers estimated an attendance of 300,000 people, the media and police estimates ranged from 35,000 to 60,000, mostly middle-class residents of Buenos Aires. Although Blumberg explicitly stated that march did not a political end, he was accompanied by Mauricio Macri and Ricardo L√≥pez Murphy, among other right-wing political leaders, as well as by a group of opposition piqueteros led by Ra√∫l Castells. Blumberg repeated his demands of harder penal laws and lowering the age of criminal responsibility, and called for the rejection of the Argentine Penal Code reform project. The march was denounced by members of the left as part of Blumberg's political campaign and as an excuse for right-wing demands. Government official and piquetero leader Luis D'El√≠a organized a \\"counter- march\\" and accused Blumberg of \\"using the pain of his son's death as a step\\" for political advance. He also noted the presence, in Blumberg's march, of people linked to the last dictatorship (notably retired Gen. Eduardo Cabanillas, Lt. Col. Emilio Nanni, and pro-military activist Cecilia Pando). Nobel Peace Prize Adolfo P√©rez Esquivel organized a parallel protest to denounce the \\"criminalization of poverty\\" that allegedly underlies Blumberg's demands, but refused to appear next to D'El√≠a and later called him \\"a speculator\\". On racism and human rights and pain After losing his son in brutal murder to kidnappers, Blumberg was interviewed in a show titled: \\"Theme of the week: A year without Axel\\" where he was shown frequently breaking down crying over his loss, adding Axel was not just a son but also a friend. He was pressed after a comment made on television. When asked by the journalist Nancy Pazos if he was racist, he answered: \\"Of course not, I even have Brazilian friends, they have white souls\\" In the same interview, when questioned about his proposed penalty for murder, he answered \\"The only adequate penalty for a murderer is death, don't give me the 'human rights' speech\\". In the 2004 lecture he said \\"no human rights advocates came to me when my son was killed...no one came.\\" His focus, since then, is his son, Axel, Axel.

Blumberg is a municipality situated in the Schwarzwald-Baar region of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. Nineteen kilometers south of Donaueschingen, it lies between the southern edge of the Schwarzwald, the Black Forest, the border with Switzerland‚Äôs Canton of Schaffhausen, and Lake Constance. History The town of Blumberg is in the region where the ancient source for the Danube is situated, the former glacial valley between Eichberg and Buchberg, and its official origins date from the 13th Century with the Masters of Blumberg first mentioned in 1260. However one of the oldest settlements, the Steppacher Hof, was already documented in the 12th century, and the town itself is believed to have originated long before that time as archaeological finds have shown the area was inhabited during the Stone Age. The Wutach is a 90 km long tributary of the River Rhine that changes name twice as it passes through the southern Black Forest, and Blumberg was established in the Wutach valley close to the ancient Wutachschlucht. The spectacular 'Wutach Gorge', now a nature reserve and conservation area known as the Grand-Canyon des Schwarzwaldes. Built above the town in the Middle Ages Blumberg castle contributed significantly towards the development of the surrounding settlements, and from 1559, while ruled by the princely Fuerstenberg family who from 1283 until 2004 also were owners of a brewery, Blumberg had grown enough in importance to be elevated from St√§dtle (town) to a 'city'. During the Thirty Years' War, 1618‚Äì1648, the castle was destroyed but after 1648, thanks to its Doggererz iron ore reserves, the town experienced a short lived expansion. Doggererz mine was reopened and ore extracted once again from 1934 to 1942, the time of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, Nazi Germany. In Nazi Germany itself and throughout German-occupied Europe the use of Forced labour under German rule during World War II was widespread, and Blumberg has a memorial honoring these workers as also in Doggererz AG Zwangsarbeiter were used as miners. The population in what had been until then a predominantly agricultural town increased dramatically. By 1945 it had risen from the 700 of 1935 to 7,000. After World War II in 1945 the town and surrounding region were occupied by French forces as part of South Baden, as the previous states of Baden and W√ºrttemberg had been divided into US and French occupation zones. Blumberg expanded during the 1950s as various industrial works became established in the district, and now has around 10.800 inhabitants, while the town is also a thriving tourist area. Nevertheless, Blumberg has retained a small town sense of community and traditional character, with time honored seasonal festivities, customs, street parties and parades such as those for Swabian‚ÄìAlemannic Fastnacht, Carnival, continuing to take place. Small specialized local stores that go back generations still exist, and for a few weeks multi-colored, decorated and filled carnival doughnuts can be found at artisanal bakers, where handmade bread, cake and cookie specialties are freshly baked daily. While from the early hours of the morning master butchers, Metzger, begin producing the region's traditionally seasoned cold cuts, sausages, and terrines as well as fresh meat and Silesian specialties from what is now mainly Poland. Tourism Sauschw√§nzlebahn, The Wutach Valley Railway Blumberg is set in the center of one of the most scenically beautiful areas of Germany, with everything from castles, nature parks, forests, lakes and mountains, to skiing, sailing, spas and tourist routes. While close by are historic cities filled with culture as well as endless shopping possibilities, and Switzerland is just minutes away. It is also the starting point for the legendary Sauschw√§nzlebahn, The Pigtail Line, The Wutach Valley Railway. An old fashioned steam locomotive, with original carriages, which runs on a railway line that curves and loops around Blumberg like a curled pigtail. It is run as a railway museum and travels on elevated tracks across the countryside throughout the summer months. This had to take a break from November to March 2013 and 2014 as over 200 endangered Barbastella bats had set up their winter quarters in the six railway tunnels, and trains would have disturbed the animals. Geography =Districts= The municipality of Blumberg is made up of the districts of Blumberg Achdorf, Blumberg, Epfenhofen, F√ºtzen, Hondingen, Kommingen, Nordhalden, Riedb√∂hringen and Ried√∂schingen, and, with the exception of Blumberg itself, each of these has its own district council, which is the custom in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. The village of Achdorf is the only one remaining of the original settlements alongside the river Wutach, which lies within scenic Wutachschlucht, the 30 km long pre-historic Danube Wutachschlucht gorge. Religion Even after the Reformation the Blumberg region remained predominantly Roman Catholic, and produced a Cardinal, Curial Cardinal Augustin Bea. Born the son of a carpenter on May 28, 1881 in Riedb√∂hringen near Donaueschingen, he died in Rome on 16. November, 1968. A museum has been created in the house where his birth took place, and this can be visited by appointment. Today the area has four Roman Catholic parishes, two parishes of the \\"Old Catholic Church\\" that follows Ultrajectine theology, as well as a Protestant and a New Apostolic Church. Associated with Blumberg Sophie Scholl one of the founders of the White Rose, a non-violent Anti Nazi resistance student group from the University of Munich, lived in Blumberg for six months at the beginning of World War II, while working for the Reichsarbeitsdienst, State Labor Service, as an 'Arbeitsmaiden', a female worker. In 1940 she helped at a Protestant cr√®che in Blumberg. This had been set up to care for children of women forcibly recruited to work, in jobs considered important for the war effort, and in her memory the 'Kindergarten Sophie-Scholl' was opened February 28, 1992. Executed for treason on February 22, 1943 she, and the group to which she belonged, have been the subject of many books and films.

The beginning of its construction dates from 900‚Äì955 CE. Located at the Cahokia Mounds UNESCO World Heritage Site near Collinsville, Illinois, the mound size was calculated in 1988 as about 100 feet (30 m) high, 955 feet (291 m) long including the access ramp at the southern end, and 775 feet (236 m) wide.Skele, Mike \\"The Great Knob\\", Studies in Illinois Archaeology, no. 4], Springfield, IL, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency (1988) , pp. 1‚Äì3, via archive.org This makes Monks Mound roughly the same size at its base as the Great Pyramid of Giza (13.1 acres / 5.3 hectares). The perimeter of its base is larger than the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan. As a platform mound, the earthwork supported a wooden structure on the summit. Unlike Egyptian pyramids which were built of stone, the platform mound was constructed almost entirely of layers of basket- transported soil and clay. Because of this construction and its flattened top, over the years, it has retained rainwater within the structure. This has caused slumping, the avalanche-like sliding of large sections of the sides at the highest part of the mound. Its designed dimensions would have been significantly smaller than its present extent, but recent excavations have revealed that slumping was a problem even while the mound was being made.Iseminger, Bill et al. \\"Monks Mound (Mound 38) Projects 1997 ‚Äì 2007 , from The Cahokian (various issues 1998‚Äì2007)- at cahokiamounds.com Construction and abandonment Monks Mound from the side showing the 2 terraces. Construction of Monks Mound by the Mississippian culture began about 900‚Äì950 CE, on a site that had already been occupied by buildings. The original concept seems to have been a much smaller mound, now buried deep within the northern end of the present structure. At the northern end of the summit plateau, as finally completed around 1100 CE, is an area raised slightly higher still, on which was placed a building over long, the largest in the entire Cahokia Mounds urban zone. Botanical remains from Monks Mound suggest it was built much more quickly than previously thought, perhaps on the order of several consecutive decades, providing an alternative view of its construction history. Deep excavations in 2007 confirmed findings from earlier test borings, that several types of earth and clay from different sources had been used successively. Study of various sites suggests that the stability of the mound was improved by the incorporation of bulwarks, some made of clay, others of sods from the Mississippi flood-plain, which permitted steeper slopes than the use of earth alone. The structure rises in four terraces to a height of with a rectangular base covering nearly and containing 22 million cubic feet of adobe, carried basket by basket to the site.Nash, Gary B. Red, White and Black: The Peoples of Early North America Los Angeles 2015. Chapter 1, p. 6 The most recent section of the mound, added some time before 1200 CE, is the lower terrace at the south end, which was added after the northern end had reached its full height. It may partly have been intended to help minimize the slumping which by then was already under way. Today, the western half of the summit plateau is significantly lower than the eastern; this is the result of massive slumping, beginning about 1200 CE. This also caused the west end of the big building to collapse. It may have led to the abandonment of the mound's high status, following which various wooden buildings were erected on the south terrace, and garbage was dumped at the foot of the mound. By about 1300, the urban society at Cahokia Mounds was in serious decline. When the eastern side of the mound started to suffer serious slumping, it was not repaired. European settlers There is no evidence of significant Native American settlement in the Cahokia Mounds urban area for hundreds of years after about 1400 CE. In 1735, French missionaries built a chapel at the west end of the south terrace of the mound. The River L'Abbe Mission served a small Illiniwek community, until they were forced to abandon the area by rival tribes about 1752. In 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, a trading post called the Cantine was established next to the mound (by then known as the Great Nobb). It lasted only until 1784. In the early 19th century, the land was claimed by people of French descent, and Nicholas Jarrot had a deed for most of it. He donated some to a small group of French Trappist monks, who settled on one of the smaller mounds from 1809. They took advantage of the big mound's terraces to grow produce, which was elevated above the danger of flooding: wheat on the upper levels, garden produce on the south terrace. During their short stay in the area, which lasted until 1813, Henry Brackenridge visited the site and published the first detailed description of the largest mound. He named it Monks Mound. In 1831 T. Amos Hill bought the plot including the Mound. He built a house on the upper terrace, and sank a well. This work revealed various archaeological remains, including human bones.John A. Walthall & Elizabeth D. Benchley, \\"The River L'Abb√© Mission: A French Colonial Church for the Cahokia Illini on Monks Mound\\", Studies in Illinois Archaeology, No. 2, Springfield, IL: Historic Preservation Agency (1987), via archive.org Archaeology Looking over the Cahokia Mounds site from the top of Monks Mound Thomas I. Ramey, who bought the site in 1864, began an era of more responsible ownership, and encouraged archaeological investigation. Many artifacts were found at or near the surface. Ramey had a tunnel made nearly into the north face of the mound, but it revealed nothing of historic interest. By this time, people were beginning to consider the mound more within its context. A survey made for local dentist Dr. John R. Patrick in the 1880s marked the beginning of modern understanding of the Cahokia site as a whole, and its relationship to other sites in the area. Many archaeological investigations of the mound have taken place since then. One of the biggest began in the 1960s, when Nelson Reed, a local businessman and historian of native cultures, obtained permission to conduct excavations. He was trying to locate the high-status building (temple or palace) presumed to have stood at the peak of Monks Mound. By drilling cores at various points on the mound, his team revealed the various stages of its construction from the 10th to 12th centuries CE. Remains of a fairly recent house (presumably Hill's) were found, but no temple. In 1970 Reed returned to work at the mound, and adopted a new strategy: scraping away the topsoil from several patches with a backhoe, to a depth of around . This quickly revealed various features, including what appeared to be the outline of the temple. Further backhoe work in 1971 confirmed the shape of the presumed temple at over long, the largest building found at Cahokia. This technique was opposed by professional archaeologists because it destroyed several hundred years of stratification over most of the mound's summit, which was the evidence by which they could place and evaluate artifacts and construction. Reed's backhoe excavations revealed other significant features, such as a hole which seemed to have been the socket for a post about three feet (one metre) in diameter. The dramatic finds encouraged the Governor of Illinois to budget for an expansion of the Cahokia Mounds State Park.Young & Fowler, pp. 154‚Äì7 Preservation From the time the original urban society collapsed, the great mound became overgrown with trees, the roots of which helped stabilize its steep slopes. In the 20th century, researchers removed the trees in the course of work at the mound and park preparation. Reduction of groundwater levels in the Mississippi floodplain during the 1950s caused the mound to dry out, damaging the clay layers within. When heavy rainfall occurred, it caused new slumping, starting about 1956. The increasingly violent weather of recent decades has exacerbated the problem.Skele, p98 In 1984-5 there were several slumps, and the state government brought in surplus soil to make repairs to the major scar on the eastern side. A decade later, there was further slumping on the western side, so irregular that repair was impractical. Drains were installed to reduce the effects of heavy rain. It was during this process that workers discovered a mass of stone deep within the mound. The repairs of the 1980s and 1990s were only partly successful. In 2004-5 more serious slumping episodes occurred. These demonstrated that adding new earth to repair the major slump on the east side had been a mistake. Experts decided to take a new approach. In 2007, backhoes were used to dig out the entire mass of earth from this slump and another at the northwest corner, to a level beyond the internal slippage zone. Engineers created a series of anti-slip \\"steps\\" across the exposed face before the original earth (minus the imported repair material) was replaced at its original level. To avoid introducing water deep into the mound's interior, the work was carried out in high summer, and as quickly as possible. In parallel with the repair work, teams of archaeologists studied the evidence that was being revealed. The eastern sliding zone penetrated more deeply within the mound than originally estimated, and the excavation had to be very large- Bostrom, Peter A. Mound repair: Cahokia Mounds (31 Jul 2007)- summary with photos 50 feet (16 m) wide, to a height of 65 feet (20 m) above the mound base. This heightened concerns about a conflict between conservation and archaeology.

Rowley is a past recipient of Thrasher Magazine 's \\"Skater of the Year\\" award. Early life Rowley started skateboarding around 1989 in his home city of Liverpool, England, United Kingdom. Rowley was enthusiastic about skateboarding. He would skate for the course of entire days, while his friends would only skate for relatively short periods. In an interview for the UK magazine, rad, Rowley stated that he first became interested in skateboarding because \\"A lot of people in my school were into skating and I became interested through them.\\" In the same interview, Rowley explained that his parents were both supportive of his skating, although his father was \\"not into me sitting around the house all day.\\" At the time of the interview, Rowley was sponsored by Gullwing, Siesta, Airwalk, and Jeremy. In a 2013 interview, Rowley provided further insight into his adolescence, explaining that skateboarding culture was not accepted during his time in Liverpool and it was during the 1980s that the culture became prominent in the city. However, even following the rise in prominence, skateboarding products were difficult to purchase: > The only place that actually sold skateboards in Liverpool at that time was > a record shop. It was called Probe Records. When I went in there for the > first time they had two boards on the wall, a Skull Skates ‚ÄúDead Guys‚Äù and a > Toxic team model. I think they had two sets of wheels and two sets of > trucks. They had no griptape and one set of bolts. That was my first memory > of going into a skateshop [laughs]. I rode my first complete with no > griptape for a month or so until Probe got some grip back in stock. Career =Flip= Rowley's first sponsor was Deathbox Skateboards, a company that was later renamed \\"Flip Skateboards\\"‚Äîat this time, Rowley was also riding for Gullwing. In a \\"Check Out\\" segment for the Transworld Skateboarding magazine, Deathbox founder, Jeremy Fox, wrote: > Technical, burly, stylish, quiet, punker, street urchin: these are the > descriptions that neatly fit young Geoff Rowley ...

Geoff is > starting to send out 'waves' across Europe, and when Deathbox ships him over > to the US, these waves will certainly come over with him. In 1994, Rowley moved to Huntington Beach, California, United States with fellow Flip team riders, Tom Penny, Rune Glifberg and Andy Scott. In 2012, Rowley reflected upon the company's move to the US: > We were a totally new company moving to a foreign country, and, ah, I don't > we kind of expected it to go \\"boom\\", and just fly right in. We had no > expectations; we didn't really know that many people, and we actually just > wanted to skate, really.

Like myself, personally, I skated a lot with Ed [Templeton], like, > every day, because he lived, like, right across the road from me. After two weeks in California, Rowley was featured on the cover of TransWorld Skateboard magazine‚Äîhe subsequently decided to relocate to the American state. In regards to his first TransWorld cover, Rowley explained in 2012: > I'd been in the States for, like, two weeks, and I was at TransWorld‚Äîwe'd > been to visit TransWorld for the first time. And Swift just wanted to go > shoot‚Äîhe needed to shoot a Gullwing [truck company]. He said, \\"You ride for > Gullwing, right?\\" I'm like, \\"Yeah, I think so ...

It still doesn't make any sense to me; I just went skating with them > and then it's on the cover of the mag. I remember gettin' it and thinking, > \\"What just happened? What? That's weird.\\" Rowley later explained the full extent of Templeton's influence during his early years in the US and stated, \\"I'll be forever in debt to him\\" due to Templeton's openness towards Rowley, as the two discovered that they shared the same interests. Rowley explained: \\"I got on really well with him straight away. As soon as we started talking it was really obvious we‚Äôd be good friends. We were into similar music and were from a similar generation.\\" In an August 2013 interview for Tony Hawk's RIDE YouTube channel, Rowley revealed that he was arrested during the filming for the 2009 Flip video Extremely Sorry. At the time of the incident, Rowley successfully executed a trick between two rooftops while accompanied by a friend and the owners of the property chose to press charges. Rowley spent around nine hours in jail and paid approximately US$20,000 bail for his friend's release‚Äîalthough the video footage of the rooftop trick was confiscated by the police, the trick remains a part of the video that was publicly released (Rowley did not explain how Flip managed to retain the footage for the final edit in either the RIDE channel interview or any other interviews). Rowley was revealed as an announcer for the Street League Skateboarding (SLS) Super Crown World Championship event on 22 August 2013. The championship event was held in New Jersey, US on 25 August 2013 and featured the competitors who had qualified during the 2013 SLS season. Rowley received an invitation to compete in the series when it was launched in 2010, but he eventually declined the offer due to a competing offer by the Maloof Company responsible for the Maloof Money Cup events‚ÄîNyjah Huston replaced Rowley's position. In his pre-championship interview, Rowley predicted that Paul Rodriguez, Chris Cole, Huston, or Luan Oliveira would emerge from the event victorious. In October 2015 Geoff Rowley left Flip. =Vans= Rowley has produced a signature line of shoes with Vans footwear since 1999, the year when his first vulcanised shoe model was produced. Rowley is credited with re-introducing the vulcanised skate shoe, whereby a new generation of skate shoes were designed with the benefits and functional superiority of the vulcanised process. In 1999, Rowley performed a \\"fifty-fifty\\" grind on the Staples Center's \\"hubba\\" ledge, in Los Angeles, US, for his first Vans advertisement; the photographic image led to a significant level of recognition due to the vulcanised shoes that he is wearing in the photograph ‚Äì at that time, the predominant trend in skate shoe construction consisted of large, bulky designs. The Vans website has written of the innovation: > At the time when Geoff hit Staples no one was skating low-cut, thin vulc > shoes. No one had felt their board in nearly half a decade. Shoes at the > time were so disgusting and bulky we try not to think about them. But when > Geoff shot that ad, doing the gnarliest trick on the biggest hubba, showing > people it wasn't about creating a bulletproof space shoe for the year 3000 > that would last for six months but rather the priority is and always should > be about board-feel everyone took a long, hard look at their feet and > wondered, 'What the f@#k are we wearing?' History was rewritten that day, by > this man. As of 2012, Rowley was working on a video project for Vans and he explained in an August 2013 interview that the video will represent a team of grateful Vans riders returning the support provided by the shoe brand thus far. In November 2013, an updated version of Rowley's signature shoe model, called the \\"Rowley Pro Lite\\", was released along with a video advertisement containing the tagline \\"The Original ... Only Lighter\\" ‚Äì a reference to the original model that was released in 1999. =Trick invention= A skateboard trick is named after Rowley: the \\"Rowley-Darkslide\\". It is a variation of a darkslide in which the trailing foot is placed on the inside of the truck for the duration of the slide. =Sponsors= As of August 2013, Rowley is sponsored by Flip Skateboards, Vans, OJ Wheels, Independent, Volcom, Lost Art Skate Shop and MOB. When asked about his request to join the team of the Liverpudlian Lost Art Skate Shop, Rowley explained that the store's owner, Mackey, is in it for \\"the long haul\\", cares about skateboarding and \\"for as long as Lost Art has been around‚Äîhe's been trying to nurture a scene and bring everybody together. He no Longer Rides for Flip.\\" =Management= Alongside sponsored skateboarders, David Gonz√°lez, Louis Lopez, Arto Saari, Curren Caples and Erik Ellington, Rowley is a client of management company RPRT. RPRT was founded by Matt Meyerson, is managed by Ken Perkins, and is described as \\"a hybrid agency whose core competencies include film/tv production, talent/athlete management, event production (they currently produce Expose NY, a twice yearly fashion showcase during NY Fashion Week geared towards the media and stylists) and brand consulting.\\" Skateboarding influences Rowley's early influences were professional skateboarders, Natas Kaupas, Kris Markovich and Danny Way. In regards to Way, Rowley has explained: > Danny was the first guy that I saw in videos that was really small, really > short, and he was doing alley-oop twists, on vert, over channels‚Äîand he was > thirteen years-old. You know? And I was around the same age, and I saw that > and I went, \\"Wow, you can do that! I wanna do that.\\" I don't know. So > Danny's been an influence that far back for me, and, still now, he's > incredible. Despite maintaining pride in his British roots, Rowley has identified the US as the home of skateboarding, explaining in 2012, \\"... it's the area where it was born, you know? Everywhere needs a heart and this is the heart of skateboarding.\\" In terms of inspiration, Rowley has identified his friends and skateboard videos, both old and new. In a 2013 interview, Rowley spoke further about the influence of Kaupas, specifically in relation to the \\"pushing of creative boundaries\\". Rowley then made a connection with progression in skateboarding, elaborating further on creativity: > He [Kaupas] was doing what he thought was weird. He was pushing his creative > boundaries. I think people get so stuck in the way to be ... Street skating > to me is different every single day you go out. I'll intentionally go out > and skate the same obstacle the opposite way I did the day before ... I > think there was a trend in skateboarding for a little while to master the > tricks forwards, backwards and every which way: catch them all high, catch > them all the same. When you do that, you homogenise form. That gets a little > too controlling and creatively confining long term for me, and I think a lot > of people feel the same way. Influence In December 2011, Transworld Skateboarding named Rowley as the twenty-sixth most influential skateboarder of all time. Following the release of the list, Rowley stated: > I think my generation‚Äîmyself, Jamie [Thomas], [Andrew] Reynolds‚Äîwe're the > first street guys to ride these real big obstacles on a daily basis. It > wasn't like we do it once for a video. I think we all group up skating like > that. I think that's what sets us apart I suppose. The willingness to f‚Äîkin' > try anything every day. Awards In the year 2000, Rowley was awarded the Thrasher Magazine's coveted \\"Skater of the Year\\" award. In response to Rowley's receipt of the award, teammate and close friend, Rune Glifberg, stated: \\"Geoff and Arto [Saari] are just some of the gnarliest skateboarders that I have ever witnessed. Geoff is just like, he's like, \\"I'm gonna do this and fuck it if I kill myself; I am just gonna do it. I don't care.\\" Saari stated, \\"He's a madman, he's a right madman ... he basically tells everyone to fucking shut the fuck up and then rolls back and comes full blast towards you, and then he fucking pulls it, somehow, it's like ...\\". In Rowley's post-award interview, he is shown holding a poster that reads: \\"Get Busy Livin' Or get Busy Dyin'\\".  Video games  Rowley has appeared in the Tony Hawk series. He appeared from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater to Tony Hawk's Underground. He also appeared in Tony Hawk: Shred and as a downloadable skater for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD. Company owner and entrepreneur In addition to his co-ownership of the Flip skateboard company, Rowley launched a new business venture in mid-2013 called \\"Civilware Service Corporation\\". Rowley explained that the brand is \\"just a creative outlet for me, for stuff that I'm interested in ... We are making coffee, axes and variety of other oddities to begin with. Hopefully guns at some point, then it would get really fun [laughs].\\" As of November 2013, the Civilware website features products such as the \\"Civilware Pathfinder Axe\\", apparel, a service tin (with coffee beans) and coffee beans. The philosophy of the brand is published as: \\"When you ask for a person‚Äôs attention ‚Äì their time, their money ‚Äì you need to return that gesture with an unparalleled level of commitment.\\" Personal life Rowley is a father and resides in Long Beach, California, US. In 2013, Rowley identified his five favourite locations in Long Beach: Cherry Park, Hamilton Skatepark, LB Skate store, Viento y Agua eatery and Vans Corporate Headquarters (in nearby Cypress). Rowley continues to follow football from Britain and is a supporter of Liverpool. Rowley used the club's anthem \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" as the music for his part in the Really Sorry skateboard video and stated that his family was pleased: \\"My whole family loved that ... That‚Äôs why the song was used‚Äîfor my parents and my grandparents. It was nod, a thank you in their direction.\\"  Videography  *Flip: The Long Overdue (unofficial) (1992) *Hook-Ups: Asian Goddess (1994) *411VM: Issue 13 (1995) *411VM: Issue 10 (1995) *Rollersnakes: 720 *Transworld: Uno (1996) *Church of Skatan: Santa Barbara (1996) *Airwalk: Skateboarding Video 96 (1996) *Volcom: Freedom Wig (1997) *411VM: Issue 30 (1998) *Transworld: Feedback (1999) *CKY2K (2000) *411VM: Best Of 411 ‚Äì Volume 5 (2000) *Digital ‚Äì No. 2 (2000) *Collage (2001) *CKY 3 (2001) *OP King of Skate (2002) *Flip: Sorry (2002) *Thrasher: S.O.T.Y.

With an apparent visual magnitude of 2.48, it is readily visible to the naked eye at night as one of the brighter members of Cygnus. Based upon parallax measurement, Epsilon Cygni is about 73 light-years from the Sun. The system has three constituents: a spectroscopic binary (designated Epsilon Cygni A); an optical companion (B) and a single star (C). A's two components are themselves designated Epsilon Cygni Aa (officially named Aljanah ) and Ab.  Nomenclature  Œµ Cygni (Latinised to Epsilon Cygni) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the three constituents as Epsilon Cygni A, B and C, and those of A's components - Epsilon Cygni Aa and Ab - derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Epsilon Cygni bore the traditional name Gienah from the Arabic al janƒÅƒß () meaning \\"the wing\\". However that name was more usually applied to Gamma Corvi. For reasons of disambiguation it was sometimes called Gienah Cygni. In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Aljanah for the component Epsilon Cygni Aa on 30 June 2017. It had previously approved the name Gienah for Gamma Corvi A on 6 November 2016. Both are now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names. In Chinese astronomy, the \\"Celestial Ford\\" () refers to an asterism consisting of Epsilon Cygni, Gamma Cygni, Delta Cygni, 30 Cygni, Alpha Cygni, Nu Cygni, Tau Cygni, Upsilon Cygni and Zeta Cygni. ‰∏≠ÂúãÊòüÂ∫ßÁ•ûË©±, written by Èô≥‰πÖÈáë. Published by Âè∞ÁÅ£Êõ∏ÊàøÂá∫ÁâàÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏, 2005, . Consequently, the Chinese name for Epsilon Cygni Cygni itself is \\"the Ninth Star of Celestial Ford\\" ().

Companions Epsilon Cygni A has an optical companion, Epsilon Cygni B, with which it is not physically associated, and a 13th magnitude candidate common proper motion companion, Epsilon Cygni C, at an angular separation of 78 arcseconds. If the latter star is gravitationally bound to Epsilon Cygni A, then they are currently separated by 1700 AU or more, and have an orbital period of at least 50,000 years.  Properties  Œµ Cygni appears north of the Veil nebula towards the bottom left Epsilon Cygni A is a single-lined spectroscopic binary. Radial velocity observations suggest a possible companion with an orbital period of at least 15 years. It presents as a giant star with a stellar classification of K0 III. This indicates that the star has left the main sequence and has begun the final stages in its stellar evolution. The effective temperature of its photosphere is 4,710 K, giving an orange hue that is a characteristic of K-type stars. It has nearly 11 times the solar radius and is about 62 times the luminosity of the Sun. Since 1943, the spectrum of Epsilon Cygni A has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. Veil Nebula Œµ Cygni lies about three degrees north of the Veil nebula, a probable ancient supernova remnant. The nebula is far more distant than the star.

Koo, was a Taiwanese businessman and diplomat. He led the Koos Group of companies from 1940 until his death. As a chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), Koo arranged the first direct talks between Taiwan and mainland China since 1949 and served as Taiwan's negotiator in both the 1993 and 1998 Wang-Koo summit. He was also a film producer and produced a number of Taiwanese films between 1973 and 1982, such as Love, Love, Love (1974), Eight Hundred Heroes (1975), Heroes of the Eastern Skies (1977), The Coldest Winter in Peking (1981), and Attack Force Z (1982). Early life Born in northern Taiwan into a wealthy family headed by his father Koo Hsien-jung, Koo attended Taihoku Imperial University (now National Taiwan University). He inherited a substantial fortune and a business upon his father's death in 1937. Koo graduated in 1940 and pursued a graduate degree in Japan. Koo was jailed in 1946 for 19 months on treason charges for helping Japanese. After his release, he took refuge in Hong Kong and only returned to Taiwan in 1949 to marry his wife, . He focused on running Koos Group as well as on his political career that led to his elevation to the central committee of Kuomintang. SEF Chairmanship Koo was the founding chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF). On 16 December 1991, a little over ten months after the establishment of the SEF, the authorities of People's Republic of China (PRC) set up the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), with Wang Daohan as its chairman. The following year Koo and Wang held preliminary talks in Hong Kong that resulted in the so-called \\"1992 Consensus\\" and facilitated negotiations of practical matters. However, the content and the existence of this \\"1992 consensus\\" is widely disputed. In 2001, Koo publicly affirmed that the meeting did not result in a consensus on the issue of \\"one- China\\". In April 1993, Koo and Wang met in Singapore to hold the first formal discussions between Taipei and Beijing since 1949. The two met again in Shanghai in 1998. On 18 October 1998, Koo met Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, in Beijing, in what was then the highest- level talks yet held between the two sides. The talks were called off by Beijing in 1999 after ROC President Lee Teng-hui proposed his two-states theory. Death Koo Chen-fu died of renal cancer on the morning of 3 January 2005 at the age of 87.

Retrieved on 29 August 2008 In the episode, Bart orders a mail- order spy camera, which he uses to secretly photograph Homer dancing with an exotic belly dancer. Marge makes Homer apologize to the exotic dancer to teach Bart that women are not objects. Sam McMurray guest stars in the episode as Gulliver Dark, the man who introduces Homer to the crowd at the burlesque show. The episode was well received by critics and it was the second highest rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. This episode, along with three other episodes of the show, is featured on The Simpsons \\"Gone Wild\\" DVD released in 2004. Plot Bart purchases a miniature spy camera from a mail- order catalog and uses it to take candid photos around the house. Later, Homer tells Marge he is going to a bachelor party for a co-worker, Eugene Fisk. While Homer is gone, Marge decides to take the children to a seafood restaurant where -- unknown to her -- the bachelor party is under way in another room. A belly dancer named Princess Kashmir arrives at the party and invites Homer to dance with her onstage. On his way to the bathroom, Bart wanders into the bachelor party and snaps a picture of Homer and Princess Kashmir dancing. Bart brings the photo to school and gives a copy to Milhouse, who promptly gets requests for copies from other students. Soon everyone in Springfield has a copy. Marge sees the picture at her aerobics class and is furious. When Homer arrives home later that day, Marge demands an explanation. Bart inadvertently reveals that the picture is his, angering both his parents. Homer spends the night at Barney's apartment after Marge kicks him out of the house. The next day, Homer goes home to apologize to Marge, who worries the picture will make Bart think it is acceptable to treat women as sex objects. She insists that Homer take Bart to meet Princess Kashmir so he can see that she is more than just a stripper. Homer and Bart scour Springfield's strip clubs searching for Princess Kashmir, eventually finding her at the Sapphire Lounge. Homer introduces himself and Bart to Princess Kashmir, who is preoccupied with her upcoming performance but understands what Homer is trying to teach his son. Homer inadvertently finds himself onstage when the striptease show starts. He is about to be thrown offstage when the audience recognizes him from the picture. Homer gets caught up in the audience's fanfare and starts dancing with the showgirls until he remembers the lesson he is trying to teach Bart. Homer stops the show and makes a plea to the audience to treat women with respect. Marge, who is in the audience, accepts Homer's apology and they reconcile. Production The episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Rich Moore. Barney's apartment, which Homer spends the night in when he is kicked out by Marge, is partly based on an apartment that Jim Reardon, Moore, and a few other animators of The Simpsons shared in college. One of the strip clubs Homer and Bart visit when they are trying to find Princess Kashmir is based on the Seventh Veil Strip Club in Los Angeles, California. The staff went around Hollywood taking pictures of strip clubs so they could get inspiration for the interior design of the strip club buildings in Springfield. The character designer designed over fifty different international showgirl costumes for the showgirls in the burlesque show sequence. Carl Carlson made his first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode. Additionally, Carl Carlson is voiced by Harry Shearer in this episode instead of Hank Azaria or Alex D√©sert who voice him in later appearances. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Homer's Night Out\\" finished fourteenth place in the weekly ratings for the week of March 19‚Äì25, 1990, with a Nielsen rating of 16.9. It was the second highest rated show on Fox that week. \\"Homer's Night Out\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck rated this episode a4 (of 5) and named it one of his two favorite episodes of the season. He added that it \\"allows us to see that Homer really does love Marge a lot without having to blatantly stamp sentimentality all over it. The episode is strange, goofy and fun.\\" Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said that \\"the concept of Marge's anger at Homer got old, but this episode managed to offer a reasonably entertaining affair. It was fun to see Homer treated like a party god, and this offered a few nice moments. The overall level of quality remained good throughout the show, but it didn't rise to any great heights.\\" David Packard at DVD Verdict said in a review of The Simpsons \\"Gone Wild\\" DVD that \\"this episode sports some of the awkward animation and voice work that is prevalent in episodes from the first season. That aspect isn't an issue to me; in fact, I quite enjoy season one as it shows the early efforts of the series getting its legs in making the transition from its origin on The Tracey Ullman Show. The problem I have with this episode is that it's not particularly funny. I chuckled a few times, but the episode doesn't have the rollicking gags and sly humor of the two episodes to follow.\\" References  External links * \\"Homer's Night Out\\" at The Simpsons.com The Simpsons (season 1) episodes 1990 American television episodes Television episodes about sexism cs:Simpsonovi (prvn√≠ s√©rie)#Svƒõt√°k Homer ","title":"Homer's Night Out"},{"id":"1360424","text":"The ByTowne Cinema is a one-screen repertory movie theatre located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Opened in 1947, the cinema is one of Ottawa's oldest movie theatres and the city's main venue for independent and foreign films. The 650-seat cinema is located on Rideau Street at Nelson, several blocks east of the Rideau Centre. History The one-screen cinema was built by Hyman Berlin throughout the fall and winter of 1946; it opened on February 10, 1947 as the Nelson Theatre. = ByTowne's origins = The ByTowne Cinema was not always called as such and was not always located on Rideau St.  1968-1989: The Towne Cinema  Located on 5 Beachwood Avenue, in the New Edinburgh district of Ottawa, the theatre was built in 1947 under the name the Linden Theatre. In 1968, the theatre was renamed to the Towne Cinema and was operated by Germain Cadieux. Since 1973, it was best known as one of Ottawa's first repertory cinemas, showing cult and classic productions, foreign and independent films. At the time, this unique and distinct format was new to Ontario cinemas. The Towne also became \\"Ottawa's alternative movie house\\". After many successful years of operation, the Towne Cinema closed in June 1989 and was renovated into retail space.  1947-1988: The Nelson Theatre  Opened in 1947 on Rideau St., the Nelson was one of the city's leading cinemas for decades. Admission was 25 cents for general seating and 35 cents for the upper loge. Two years, Berlin leased the Nelson to the Famous Players chain of cinemas. During the time of Famous Players' lease, they advertised the available air conditioning with a huge banner that was suspended from the marquee. In 1988, Famous Players was no longer interested in running a single-screen cinema. Subsequently, the cinema was periodically closed when the chain moved to multiplexes. The Berlin family sold the cinema to the operators of the Towne Cinema. = Name origins = Stone engraving on the wall of the entrance at the ByTowne Cinema Nelson Theatre was the original name at the time of opening. It is a logical name, since it is located on the corner of Rideau St. and Nelson St. However, the name was actually selected by Mrs. J.H. Goyette through a naming contest. This contest received more than 4,000 suggestions and Mrs. J.H Goyette won a $100 cash prize.  1988-present: The ByTowne Cinema  On October 1, 1988, Bruce White and Jean Cloutier reopened the cinema, renamed the ByTowne, in honour of Bytown, Ottawa's original name until January 1, 1855, and because it was the second cinema for the owners of the Towne Cinema on Beachwood Avenue. The ByTowne Cinema began showing alternative and repertory films, with different films each day.  Timeline of theatre operations  * The Linden Theatre (1947-1968) * The Towne Cinema (1968-1989) * The Nelson Theatre (1947-1988) * The ByTowne Cinema (1988‚Äìpresent) = Ownership = Beginning at the Towne Cinema, Jean Cloutier, who was an usher, was asked to become a manager by the former operator of the Towne. Also, Bruce White began as a graphic designer for the Towne Cinema's programme. In 1983, Cadieux sold the Towne Cinema to Jean Cloutier and Bruce White. In 1988, Bruce White and Jean Cloutier bought the Nelson Theatre for $790,000. Similar to the Towne Cinema, the pair transformed the Nelson into a repertory cinema, under the name ByTowne Cinema. The Towne and the ByTowne operated simultaneously for 9 months, with slightly different programs. In June 1989, White moved the entire operation to the ByTowne and closed the Towne Cinema. = Renovations = The cinema was built in 1946 by the prolific architects Harold Kaplan and Abraham Sprachman.leftSince 1947, the ByTowne has made many improvements and renovations: the screen and projection, completely renovated the washrooms and installed new seats with more legroom. The theatre was renovated in the early sixties to add wider and plusher seats, reducing its seating capacity from 940 to 770. Likewise, 70 mm projection facilities, along with new sound systems and wider screens were installed. The cinema was renovated again in 2000 and 175 old ByTowne seats were replaced. One hundred and fifty \\"airline-style\\" seats were salvaged from the recently closed Capitol Square multiplex on Queen Street. When those seats were installed in the 1980s, they were known as \\"the best seats in town\\", equipped with high backs and cupholders. The seating in the ByTowne Cinema was reduced to 670 and the renovations costed $30,000. On March 25, 2000, in order to pay for the renovations, a garage sale was held by the ByTowne Cinema. Movie posters, CDs, and film reels were offered as sale items. In the fall of 2011, the cinema installed Christie digital projector, although its two 35mm projectors remain operational. In May 2013, the ByTowne renovated its auditorium. The ground level seats were replaced with 435 new Greystone \\"Madrid\\" chairs. The total number of seating was reduced to 650.  General information  = Admission and memberships = The ByTowne Cinema's main entrance.General admission is $12.00 (for non-members). The ByTowne Cinema offers full year memberships for $12.00. ByTowne members receive a discounted admission price of $8.00, as well a subscription to receive the ByTowne Guide. Seniors (65+) and full-time students can purchase ByTowne memberships for $6.00. = The ByTowne Guide = Bi-monthly, the ByTowne Cinema self publishes The ByTowne Guide. With a full listing of each film that will play at the cinema for the next two months, the publication also includes many pictures, local advertising, reviews and other commentary. This form of advertisement originates from the Towne Cinema.  Showings  = Hollywood hits = \\"El Cid\\", \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and \\"The Exorcist\\", made their debut at the cinema. Later on, the cinema hosted big box-office bestsellers such as \\"Jaws\\", \\"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\\", \\"Star Trek\\", as well as some of their sequels. Other popular films displayed at the cinema, but not limited to: * 12 Years A Slave * The Adventures of Tintin * Ferdinand * Gone Girl * The Help * La La Land * The Perks of Being A Wallflower  Musicals  \\"The Sound Of Music\\", showed for a long period in 1965, is amongst some of the previously shown musicals. Subsequently, many other notable musicals, like \\"Funny Girl\\" and \\"Willy Wonka& the Chocolate Factory\\" were screened. = Independent and foreign films = The ByTowne is best known for showing a wide variety of independent, \\"non-mainstream\\", cult and international films. * An African Election * Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry * Les Femmes du 6e √©tage * Habemus Papam (We Have A Pope) * Happiness * The Insult * Kandahar Journals * Patang (The Kite) * Throne Of Blood  2017: The Breadwinner  On September 22, 2017, the ByTowne Cinema hosted a red carpet screening of \\"The Breadwinner\\". This film screening was a part of the Ottawa International Animation Festival.  Threat to Canadian repertory cinemas  Repertory cinemas, such as the ByTowne and Mayfair Theatre, show Canadian and foreign films that other major chains will not. However, over the past years, repertory theatres have been having financial difficulties. Especially with the new rules set by Hollywood distributors, it is even harder for repertory cinemas to sustain. For example, Buena Vista Pictures prohibits the showings of Disney films for family matinees in repertory theatres. The ByTowne Cinema produces most of their profit on Canadian and independent foreign films. Owner Bruce White explains, \\"we book most of our films from distributors that are Canadian owned. This is not to say that we never do business with the Americans, but the extra grief that they generate is inversely proportionate to the amount of business that we do\\". White also adds that \\"Disney isn't worth the hassle\\" and trying to change the minds of the big companies is pointless.

It split off from the Ku Klux Klan. According to historian Rick Perlstein, the FBI estimated its membership \\"at 135,000, including a large number of public officials, possibly including Detroit‚Äôs police chief.\\" In 1936 the group was suspected of having killed as many as 50 people, according to the Associated Press, including Charles Poole, an organizer for the federal Works Progress Administration. At the time of Poole's murder, the Associated Press described the organization as \\"A group of loosely federated night-riding bands operating in several States without central discipline or common purpose beyond the enforcement by lash and pistol of individual leaders' notions of 'Americanism'.\\"AP, \\"Black Legion\\", 31 May 1936 Based on testimony in the trial of Poole's killer, Dayton Dean, Wayne County Prosecutor Duncan McRae conducted a widespread investigation and prosecuted another 37 men suspected of Legion murders and assaults. All were convicted and sentenced to prison. These cases and associated negative publicity resulted in a rapid decline in Legion membership. The sensational cases inspired two related films, one starring Humphrey Bogart, and two radio show episodes from 1936 to 1938. Background In 1915, the release of D. W. Griffith's film, The Birth of a Nation, inspired a revival of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in Atlanta, Georgia. Gradually the new Klan, often appealing to migrants to cities as a fraternal order, established new chapters nationwide, particularly in urban areas, including the rapidly changing cities of the industrial Midwest. Throughout the 1920s, cities such as Detroit, Cleveland and Indianapolis were centers of an increase in Klan membership and activity in local chapters, in reaction to high rates of immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe, and internal migration of blacks from the South. A sexual scandal in the national leadership in 1925, and local actions by opponents determined to unmask the secrecy of members, caused membership to drop rapidly through the late 1920s. Initially, the Black Legion was part of the Klan. It was founded by William Shepard as a paramilitary force like the KKK was an enforcement extension of the Democratic Party called the Black Guard in the 1920s, in the Appalachian region of East Central Ohio. Its original mission was to protect regional officers of the KKK. The Black Legion formed chapters all across Ohio, and it expanded into other areas of the Midwestern United States. One of its self-described leaders, Virgil \\"Bert\\" Effinger, lived and worked in Lima, Ohio. Like the KKK, the Black Legion was largely made up of native-born, working-class, Protestant white men in the Midwest. These men feared the rapid social changes underway and resented competition with immigrants such as Italians and Jews and migrants in the industrial economy of major cities such as Detroit. Their enemies list \\"included all immigrants, Catholics, Jews and blacks, nontraditional Protestant faiths, labor unions, farm cooperatives and various fraternal groups.\\"David J. Krajicek, \\"Wrongful murder in 1936 led Black Legion leader Dayton Dean's confession\\", New York Daily News, 29 May 2010, accessed 16 September 2015 Membership was concentrated in Michigan and Ohio. Black Legion members created a network for jobs and influence. In addition, as a secret vigilante group, the Legion members operated in gangs in order to enforce their view of society, sometimes attacking immigrants to intimidate them at work, or to enforce their idea of moral behavior. They generally opposed socialism and union organizing. They had a reputation for frequent violence against alleged enemies, whether political or social. From 1933 to 1936, they were rumored to be responsible for some unsolved deaths that had officially been attributed to suicide or unknown perpetrators. In 1931, a chapter of the Black Legion was formed in Highland Park, Michigan, by Arthur F. Lupp, Sr. of that community, who styled himself its major general. Throughout and perhaps fueled by the economic and social upheaval of the Great Depression, the Black Legion continued to expand across Michigan until the mid-1930s, when its estimated membership peaked at between 20,000 and 30,000. In general, Black Legion members in the state were native-born Protestant men. One-third of its members lived in the city of Detroit, which had also been a strong center of KKK activity in the 1920s. The Michigan Legion was organized along military lines, with 5 brigades, 16 regiments, 64 battalions, and 256 companies. It boasted of a membership of one million Legionnaires in Michigan, but observers estimated that it had between 20,000 and 30,000 members. One-third of them were located in Detroit, with many living in Highland Park.  Recruitment  The Black Legion used methods such as kidnapping people to join their group, threatening them into joining, and making them swear not to tell anyone. They would also beat up members if they threatened to quit. The Legion wanted sports figures as members. It was looking into recruiting Mickey Cochrane, player-manager for the Detroit Tigers. He had a nervous breakdown in 1936 and removed himself from the team over Black Legion suspicions. One of these Legion members, Dayton Dean, broke their code and told the authorities of Black Legion's illegal activities. Dayton Dean participated in two of the murders that the Black Legion committed. Murder of Charles Poole On May 12, 1936,George Morris, \\"The Black Legion Rides\\", New York: Workers Library Publishers, August 1936, Internet Archive, accessed 16 September 2015 Charles A. Poole, a federal organizer for the Works Progress Administration, was kidnapped from his home by a gang of Black Legion members. They claimed that Poole, a French Catholic married to a Protestant woman, beat his wife, and that they intended to punish him for it. He was shot and killed that night by Dayton Dean. Wayne County Prosecutor Duncan McRae, who had been reported by the Detroit Times as a member of the Black Legion, worked to restore his public reputation and vowed to bring the killers of Poole to justice.Tom Stanton, Terror in the City of Champions: Murder, Baseball, and the Secret Society that Shocked Depression-era Detroit, Rowman & Littlefield, 2016 Authorities arrested and prosecuted a gang of twelve men affiliated with the Legion. Dayton Dean pleaded guilty and testified against numerous other members; ten others were convicted of the murder, nine by a jury and one in a bench trial. One man was acquitted. Dean and the others convicted were all sentenced to life in prison. At the time of Poole's murder, the Associated Press described the organization as \\"A group of loosely federated night-riding bands operating in several States without central discipline or common purpose beyond the enforcement by lash and pistol of individual leaders' notions of 'Americanism'.\\" Dean provided considerable testimony to authorities about other activities of the Black Legion. Prejudiced primarily against Catholics, particularly Italian and Slavic immigrants, he and his collaborators had never learned that Becky Poole, a blue-eyed blonde, had a great-grandfather who was African American.Richard Bak, \\"The Dark Days of the Black Legion\\" , Hour Detroit Magazine, March 2009, accessed 16 September 2015 Prosecutions for earlier murders Dean's testimony and other evidence stimulated investigations by Prosecutor McRae. He gained indictments into a series of other murders and attempted murders in the Detroit area during the previous three years. In total, another 37 men of the Legion were prosecuted for these related crimes, convicted, and sentenced to prison terms. The trials revealed the wide network of Black Legion members in local governments, particularly in Highland Park. For instance, member N. Ray Markland had served as mayor of Highland Park. Members also included a chief of police and a city councilman in the suburb, in addition to persons in civil service jobs. Following the convictions and publicity, membership in the Legion dropped quickly; its reign of terror ended in the Detroit area. \\"The Murder that Brought Down the Black Legion\\", Detroit News, 5 August 1997, accessed 15 September 2015 Among the cases, the prosecutor indicted Black Legion members for the 1935 murder of Silas Coleman of Detroit.\\"The Black Legion Rides\\", pp.18-19 The African- American man had been found killed outside Putnam Township, Michigan, on May 26, 1935,Michigan death records nearly a year before Poole's abduction and murder. Members were also indicted for a 1933 conspiracy to murder Arthur Kingsley, a Highland Park publisher of a community paper, who was a candidate for mayor in 1934. They had planned to shoot him in 1933 because he ran against Markland, a Legionnaire politician. Sixteen Black Legion members were indicted in Kingsley's case, including \\"two factory policemen, a police officer, and several Highland Park city employees. At the time of his arrest, Markland was employed as an investigator in the office of Wayne County Prosecutor McCrea.\\" Nine members were convicted in this case, including Markland and Arthur F. Lupp Sr., then a milk inspector for the Detroit Board of Health.(AP) Associated Press, \\"Black Legion Heads Guilty\\", Cornell Daily Sun, Volume 57, Number 109, 3 March 1937, accessed 16 September 2015 Lupp was said to have founded the Legion in Michigan by setting up the chapter in Highland Park. Through these cases, authorities learned that Mayor William Voisine of Ecorse, Michigan had been identified as a potential target of the Legion; its members had resented his hiring African Americans for city jobs. McRae prosecuted and gained convictions of a total of 37 Legion members on these and related charges, beyond those charged in the Poole case. All received prison terms, markedly reducing the power of the Black Legion in Detroit and Michigan. Other murders linked to the Black Legion were of labor organizers, both of whom were from eastern Europe: * George Marchuk, Secretary of the Auto Workers Union in Lincoln Park, was found dead on December 22, 1933, with a bullet in his head. * John Bielak, an A. F. of L. organizer in the Hudson Motor Car Company plant, who had led a drive for a wage increase, \\"was found riddled with bullets on March 15, 1934, on a road about ten miles from Monroe, Michigan.\\" The \\"arson squad\\" of the Black Legion confessed to the August 1934 burning of the farm of labor organizer William Mollenhauer, which was located in Oakland County, Michigan, near Pontiac. Members also described numerous plans to disrupt legitimate political meetings and similar activities. The cases received international media coverage. For instance, the Poole case and the secret Black Legion were reported by The Sydney Morning Herald of Australia on May 25, 1936. Representation in other media Hollywood, radio and, later TV, responded to the lurid nature of the Legion with works that referred to it. * Legion of Terror (1936) starred Ward Bond and Bruce Cabot, and was based on this group. * Black Legion (1937), a feature film starring Humphrey Bogart, was based on the events of the Charles Poole murder, though names and details of the case were changed for the film. It depicted the devastating effect of domestic terrorist groups like the Black Legion on an ordinary American man, his family, his neighbors, and his coworkers. The National Board of Review named Black Legion as the best film of 1937, and Humphrey Bogart as the best actor for his work in the film. * True Detective Mysteries, a radio show based on the magazine of the same title, broadcast an episode on April 1, 1937, that referred directly to the Black Legion and Poole's murder. * The radio show The Shadow, with Orson Welles in the title role, broadcast an episode on March 20, 1938, entitled \\"The White Legion\\"; it was based loosely on the Black Legion. Since the late 20th century, the group has received renewed historic and popular attention. * Malcolm X and Alex Haley collaborated on the leader's The Autobiography of Malcolm X (1965). Malcolm noted that the Legion had been active in Lansing, Michigan, where his family lived.

Hostak twice held the National Boxing Association Middleweight title between 1938 and 1940. He was known as a hard puncher and had a record of 64 wins (41 knockouts), 9 losses (3 knockouts), and 11 draws. In 2003, Hostak made The Ring Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.  Early career and life  Hostak was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Slovak immigrants who eventually moved to Seattle, Washington when Hostak was two, settling in South Seattle's Georgetown District. Having developed a stutter in his youth, Hostak was drawn to boxing after fighting several of his tormentors. He would begin his boxing career as a 16-year-old in 1932, fighting many of his bouts in nearby White Center. Hostak would go unbeaten for his first 27 bouts in the Seattle area, all four and six-rounders, before losing a decision to Jimmy Best. He would continue to fight preliminary matches through the end of 1936, while he worked as a sparring partner for 1936 middleweight title holder Freddie Steele of Tacoma, Washington.  Rise to prominence  As 1937 began, middleweight champion Freddie Steele's handlers decided to show him on the East Coast away from his home in the Pacific Northwest. With Steele, Seattle's top boxing draw leaving town, Nate Druxman needed to develop another box office attraction, a role Hostak would fulfill in 1937. Hostak began the year by knocking out Newark middleweight contender Tony Fisher, in two rounds on January 12. A month later he knocked out Leonard Bennett, who had broken Steele's jaw in their first bout. In March and April, Hostak scored second- round knockouts of Johnny Sikes and Young Terry. This set up a bout with Eddie (Babe) Risko on July 13, 1937. Risko lost the middleweight title a year before to Steele, and had lost a rematch as well. Hostak gained national recognition when he knocked out Risko in the 7th round in Seattle. In a clear victory, Risko was floored by Hostak once in the third, and once in the fourth. Catching his opponent flat-footed with no defense, Hostak drove his right with great power into Risko's unguarded chin, followed with two rights to the ribs. Risko went down for the count.\\"Risko Takes Bad Beating From Hostak\\", The Evening News, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, pg. 12, 14 July 1937 In August, he knocked out Allen Matthews in nine rounds. With three more knockouts in 1937, he stretching his streak to eleven. At the end of 1937, Ring Magazine ranked Hostak the #3 Middleweight in the world. A match with Steele in Seattle appeared likely for the summer of 1938. Steele suffered a setback in January, when Fred Apostoli stopped him in a non-title bout at Madison Square Garden. In the process, New York recognized Apostoli, not Steele as middleweight champion. Seattle promoter Nate Druxman continued with plans to pit Steele against Hostak that summer.  Taking the NBA world middleweight championship, Freddie Steele, July, 1938  Hostak's bout with Steele was scheduled for July 26, 1938, at Seattle's Civic Stadium. It would be the largest attendance in Seattle's boxing history, with over 35,000 fans. Hostak used his own jab to parry Steeles's. Feinting with his jab to entice Steele to drop his right hand, he connected with a rapid left hook that travelled only eight inches, but knocked Steele down. Though Steele was up quickly from the initial knockdown, Hostak would send him back to the canvas three more times. Steele arose quickly from his third trip to the canvas, but after a stiff right, Steele was counted out by referee Jack Dempsey at 1:43 of the 1st round, officially giving Hostak his first NBA world middleweight championship. Hostak fought again in September 1938, stopping Young Stuhley in three rounds.Put down for the last time with a stiff right in \\"Freddie Steele Kayoed in First\\", Daily News, New York, New York, pg. 184, 27 July 1938 =Losing the NBA world middleweight title to Solly Krieger, September, 1938= He made his first title defense against Brooklyn's Solly Krieger on November 1, 1938, losing a fifteen round decision before a crowd of 10,000, in Seattle. Hostak broke both of his hands early in the bout. Krieger fought inside against Hostak, pounding his body. In the 14th round, Krieger sealed a majority decision victory, when he knocked down a tired Hostak for the first time in his career. With terrific body blows, and savage and effective infighting, Krieger wrested the championship from Hostak. Krieger employed a successful bob and weave strategy, which puzzled Hostak, and which he could not successfully defend, particularly in later rounds.\\"Hostak Loses to Krieger\\", Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 31, 2 November 1938 Retaking the world middleweight championship, Solly Krieger, June, 1939 After his hands had healed, Hostak returned with a third-round knockout of Johnny Erjavec in Seattle, before facing Krieger before a huge crowd of 22,000 in a world middleweight championship rematch in Seattle on June 27, 1939. In the seven and a half months between their two bouts, Krieger boxed as a light heavyweight having a very difficult time making the 160-pound middleweight limit. Krieger was a shadow of his former self in the rematch, forcing himself to lose weight too quickly, and Hostak knocked him down four times. Hostak forced Krieger to take the lead, but when he took a defensive crouch, Hostak opened him up with blows to the midsection. In the fourth Hostak knocked Krieger to the canvas with a flurry of lefts and rights for a count of nine. On his second trip to the canvas, the referee called a fourth-round TKO. Hostak became the first boxer to regain the middleweight title since Stanley Ketchel in 1908.Jones, George, \\"Hostak Stops Krieger to Regain Title\\", The San Bernardino County Sun, San Bernardino, California, pg. 19, 28 June 1939 After an October 1939 non-title knockout over Charley Coates, Hostak signed for his first bout ever outside of the state of Washington, facing German-Jewish refugee Eric Seelig in Cleveland on December 11, 1939. On December 11, 1935 Seelig fought an NBA world middleweight title match against Al Hostak before an enthusiastic crowd of 10,000 at the Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, losing in a first round knockout of a scheduled fifteen rounds. Seelig sparred cautiously in the opening of the round, but was sent to the canvas from a crushing left hook to the right side of his jaw, and could not resume the bout until a count of nine was completed. A left and right put him to the canvas for the count 1:21 into the first round.Becker, Fred, \\"Seelig is Stopped in Opening Stanza\\", The Evening Independent, Massillon, Ohio, pg. 10, 12 December 1939Left hook to jaw in \\"Champions Keep Crown in Tilts\\", Freeport Journal-Standard, Freeport, Illinois, pg. 15, 12 December 1939 =Losing the NBA world middleweight title with injured hands to Tony Zale, July, 1940= Nate Druxman rematched Hostak and Zale for the middleweight title on July 19, 1940, before a crowd of 16,000, at Civic Stadium in Seattle. Once again Hostak injured his hands in the bout, while Zale wore him down with a devastating body attack. Before badly injuring his hands, Hostak had his best round in the fifth when he dished out his heaviest punches, and left Zale groggy.\\"Zale Crumples Hostak to Win NBA Title\\", The Times San Mateo, California, pg. 6, 20 July 1940 With both of his eyes swollen, and his left hand apparently injured, Hostak was dropped in the 12th for a count of nine and again in 13th rounds, before the bout was stopped 1:20 in the thirteenth by referee Benny Leonard and Zale took the title from Hostak.\\"Tony Zale Beats Hostak\\", The San Bernardino County Sun, San Bernardino, California, pg. 14, 20 July 1940 Zale's rushing attack with left hooks to the head, and occasional uppercuts to the chin, proved too much for Hostak, particularly in the second half of the bout. Earlier on January 29, 1940, Hostak had unsuccessfully fought a non-title match before a crowd of 11,112 in Chicago against middleweight contender Zale at Chicago Stadium. It may be important to note that Hostak knocked Zale down in the 1st round, breaking two fingers in his left hand in the 5th round.Broke two fingers in left hand, in \\"Hostak Will Lose Crack at Champ\\", The Columbus Telegram, Columbus, Nebraska, pg. 7, 20 January 1940 As a result, Zale swept the last five rounds to take a unanimous decision.  Post-championship boxing career  After taking time for his hands to heal, Hostak returned in February 1941 with a knockout win in Chicago, followed up by two more knockouts in April and May in Seattle. He returned to Chicago to face Zale in a third fight on May 28, 1941. Hostak knocked down Zale early, but he was up before a count could be administered. In the 2nd round, Zale pounded Hostak to the body, dropping him eight times, before he was finally counted out. In November, Hostak would make his first and only appearance at Madison Square Garden, against former middleweight champion Ken Overlin. Overlin easily outboxed a befuddled Hostak, who threw very few punches before losing a lopsided decision. In Hostak's absence from Seattle, another middleweight attraction had been developed by Druxman, Harry (Kid) Matthews of Emmett, Idaho. The two would face each other on September 29, 1942, in Seattle, with Hostak knocking Matthews down twice, but again being outboxed, losing a majority decision. The two would fight to a draw in a November rematch in Seattle. This time both boxers performed more poorly than in their first bout, particularly Matthews, who spent much of the bout in retreat. Hostak's boxing career temporarily ended along with Druxman's after the bout, as both did service in World War II. Hostak joined the Army in 1942, and trained as a paratrooper, serving in the 101st Airborne. His overseas duty included acting as part of the occupying force in Japan, according to his son. Hostak had two bouts in 1944 while stationed in Houston, Texas, scoring a pair of knockouts. On June 21, 1944, he defeated Glen Lee in a third round knockout for the USA Texas Light Heavyweight championship while serving as a Corporal in the army. Both contestants were serving in the armed forces, and Jack Dempsey, a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy served as referee. The match raised millions in war bonds.\\"Sports Shorts\\", The Emporia Gazette, Emporia, Kansas, pg. 12, 22 June 1944 He made his post-war return in June 1946, with four more knockouts against modest opposition. He took on middleweight contender Steve Belloise in Houston in January 1947. He sent Belloise to the mat in the 1st, but was knocked out in the 4th. After a 5th- round TKO over Anton Raadik in August 1947 in Chicago, Hostak avenged his loss to Belloise by winning a decision in Seattle before a crowd of 7,000 on August 26. Hostak put Belloise down for a seven count in the second, and had an edge in eight of the ten rounds with only one to Belloise and one even.Crowd of 7,000, and he took eight rounds in \\"Al Hostak Whips Steve Belloise\\", Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Honolulu, Hawaii, pg. 20, 27 August 1947 With the win, the 31-year-old Hostak again earned a rating and wide recognition as a middleweight contender. Hostak's resurgence would be short-lived, as he was held to a draw in a mixed decision on October 7, 1947 by George Duke, with many fans thinking Duke had outboxed him.Duke may have outboxed him in \\"George Duke, Hostak Draw\\", Herald and News, Klamath Falls, Oregon, pg. 8, 8 October 1947 He then lost a split decision in Portland, Oregon, to Jack Snapp, followed by a draw to Paul Perkins. In December 1948, Hostak decisioned Perkins in a rematch, before finishing his career on his 33rd birthday by stopping Snapp in nine rounds in Seattle. =Life after boxing= After boxing, Hostak held jobs as a bartender, a King County Jail guard, and a security guard at the Longacres Race Track. He even taught school-age kids how to defend themselves in fights. Hostak was married to Rose Francis in 1948. He died on August 13, 2006, in Kirkland, Washington, of complications from a stroke that he suffered ten days earlier, and was interred at Calvary Catholic Cemetery in Seattle. He was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1997.

He was also called Antyllus, a nickname given to him by his father meaning \\"the Archer\\". Despite his three children by Cleopatra, Marc Antony designated Antyllus as his official heir, a requirement under Roman law and a designation that probably contributed to his execution at age 17 by Octavian (later the Emperor Augustus). Name His nickname Antyllus means \\"the archer\\" in Greek, but there has been some speculation among historians that this name is actually a corrpution of Antonillus which means \\"little Antonius\\". Family Antyllus was the eldest child of Mark Antony by his third wife, Fulvia, who was a great-great granddaughter of Scipio Africanus. He had one full sibling, his younger brother Iullus Antonius. His maternal half siblings were Clodia Pulchra, Publius Clodius Pulcher Minor by his mothers first husband Clodius, and another half-brother named Gaius Scribonius Curio by his mother's second husband Curio. His paternal half siblings were Antonia Prima (by Antonia Hybrida Minor), Antonia Major and Antonia Minor (by Octavia Minor), and Alexander Helios, Cleopatra Selene II, and Ptolemy Philadelphus (by Cleopatra VII). Biography Antyllus was born and raised in Rome. His mother, Fulvia, died in October 40 BC, from illness, while in political exile in Sicyon, Greece. His father remarried to Octavia Minor, the second elder sister to Octavian (future Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus) who was a member of the Second Triumvirate. In his younger years, he was betrothed to Octavian's daughter Julia the Elder. After the alliance between his father and Octavian ended, the engagement was broken off. Between 40 - 36 BC, he lived with his father, step mother and his siblings in his father's mansion, in Athens, Greece. After 36 BC, he accompanied his father as they left Greece and lived his remaining years in Alexandria, Egypt in the court of Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt. His physician was a Greek man called Philotas. From Plutarch's account of Antony, clause 28, the historian gives a story of the character of Antyllus: > For they had an association called The Inimitable Livers, and every day they > feasted one another, making their expenditures of incredible profusion. At > any rate, Philotas, the physician of Amphissa, used to tell my grandfather, > Lamprias, that he was in Alexandria at the time, studying his profession, > and that having got well acquainted with one of the royal cooks, he was > easily persuaded by him (young man that he was) to take a view of the > extravagant preparations for a royal supper. Accordingly, he was introduced > into the kitchen, and when he saw all the other provisions in great > abundance, and eight wild boars a-roasting, he expressed his amazement at > what must be the number of guests. But the cook burst out laughing and said: > \\"The guests are not many, only about twelve; but everything that is set > before them must be at perfection, and this an instant of time reduces. For > it might happen that Antony would ask for supper immediately, and after a > little while, perhaps, would postpone it and call for a cup of wine, or > engage in conversation with some one. Wherefore,\\" he said, \\"not one, but > many suppers are arranged; for the precise time is hard to hit.\\" This tale, > then, Philotas used to tell; and he said also that as time went on he became > one of the medical attendants of Antony's oldest son, whom he had of Fulvia, > and that he usually supped with him at his house in company with the rest of > his comrades, when the young man did not sup with his father. Accordingly, > on one occasion, as a physician was making too bold and giving much > annoyance to them as they supped, Philotas stopped his mouth with some such > sophism as the: \\"To the patient who is somewhat feverish cold water must be > given; but everyone who has a fever is somewhat feverish; therefore to > everyone who has a fever cold water should be given.\\" The fellow was > confounded and put to silence, whereat Antony's son was delighted and said > with a laugh: \\"All this I bestow upon thee, Philotas,\\" pointing to a table > covered with a great many large beakers. Philotas acknowledged his good > intentions, but was far from supposing that a boy so young had the power to > give away so much. After a little while, however, one of the slaves brought > the beakers to him in a sack, and bade him put his seal upon it. And when > Philotas protested and was afraid to take them, \\"You miserable man,\\" said > the fellow, \\"why hesitate?

However, > take my advice and exchange them all with us for money; since perchance the > boy's father might miss some of the vessels, which are of ancient > workmanship and highly valued for their art.\\" Such details, then, my > grandfather used to tell me, Philotas would recount at every opportunity. After the defeat at Battle of Actium, Octavian invaded Egypt in 30 BC. Antyllus was involved in one of three unsuccessful emissaries to Octavian. His father sent him to Octavian with a large sum of money, in exchange for peace. Octavian kept the money, but dismissed Antyllus and returned him to his father. After losing further battles, Antony committed suicide and Cleopatra soon followed him. Not so long after the deaths of his father and stepmother, Antyllus' tutor Theodorus betrayed him to Octavian. Pleading in vain for mercy from Octavian, Antyllus was dragged from the image of the now deified Julius Caesar by Roman soldiers. Octavian ordered his execution on the same day as that of Caesarion. After Antyllus was beheaded, Theodorus took a precious stone that the young man had worn on a chain around his neck and sewed the stone into his belt. Although Theodorus denied the theft, Octavian tried him, found him guilty, and ordered his crucifixion. According to Plutarch and Suetonius, Antyllus was the only child of Mark Antony to be executed by Octavian. His remaining siblings (Iullus Antonius, Alexander Helios, Cleopatra Selene II, and Ptolemy Philadelphus) were spared by Octavian and were raised by Octavia Minor (Antony's fourth wife), in Rome.

It is the ecclesiastical arm of the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), an international fraternal initiatory organization devoted to promulgating the Law of Thelema. Thelema is a philosophical, mystical and religious system elaborated by Aleister Crowley, and based on The Book of the Law. The word Catholic denotes the universality of doctrine and not a Christian or Roman Catholic belief set. The chief function of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica is the public and private performance of the Gnostic Mass (Liber XV), a eucharistic ritual written by Crowley in 1913. According to William Bernard Crow, Crowley wrote the Gnostic Mass \\"under the influence of the Liturgy of St. Basil of the Russian Church\\".W. B. Crow quoted in T. Apiryon, Introduction to the Gnostic Mass. Its structure is also influenced by the initiatory rituals of the Ordo Templi Orientis.King, Francis (1973). Secret Rituals of the O.T.O. New York: Samuel Weiser. Its most notable separation from similar rites of other churches is a Priestess officiating with a Priest, Deacon, and two Children. In addition to the Eucharist, baptism, confirmation, marriage, and last rites are offered by E.G.C. Marriage is not limited to couples of opposite gender. About the Gnostic Mass, Crowley wrote in The Confessions of Aleister Crowley, \\"... the Ritual of the Gnostic Catholic Church ... I prepared for the use of the O.T.O., the central ceremony of its public and private celebration, corresponding to the Mass of the Roman Catholic Church.\\" It is the single most commonly performed ritual at O.T.O. bodies, with many locations celebrating the Mass monthly or more frequently. Most O.T.O. bodies make some or all of these celebrations open to interested members of the public, so the Mass is often an individual's first experience of the O.T.O. Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica has a hierarchical structure of clergy, assisting officers, and laity which parallels the degree structure of the O.T.O. initiatory system. Before 1997, the two systems were more loosely correlated, but since then there have been strict rules concerning minimum O.T.O. degrees required to serve in particular E.G.C. roles. Membership Membership in Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica is similar to the Roman Catholic Church, with some important differences. As currently constituted, E.G.C. includes both clergy and laity. Clergy must be initiate members of O.T.O., while laity may affiliate to E.G.C. through baptism and confirmation without undertaking any of the degree initiations of the Order. Novice clergy are initiate members who participate in the administration of E.G.C. sacraments, although they have not yet taken orders (i.e., been through a ceremony of ordination). The first ordination in E.G.C. is that of the diaconate. Second Degree initiates of O.T.O. who have been confirmed in E.G.C. can be ordained as Deacons, whose principal duties are to assist the Priesthood. The sacerdotal ordination admits members to the priesthood. Sacerdotal ordinands must hold at least the K.E.W. degree of O.T.O., a degree only available by invitation. The Priesthood is responsible for administering the sacraments through the Gnostic Mass and other ceremonies as authorized by their supervising Bishops. The Priesthood is supervised and instructed by the Episcopate, or Bishops. Full initiation to the Seventh Degree of O.T.O. includes episcopal consecration in E.G.C. The Tenth Degree Supreme and Holy King serves as the Primate or chief Bishop for any country in which O.T.O. has organized a Grand Lodge. The Frater (or Soror) Superior of O.T.O. is also the Patriarch (Matriarch) of the Church, with ultimate authority over the clergy. Rituals The principal ritual of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica is the Gnostic Mass, a Eucharistic ceremony written by Aleister Crowley in 1913. Theodor Reuss produced and authorized a German translation in 1918. The text of the Gnostic Mass makes reference to ceremonies of baptism, confirmation, and marriage. Crowley left some notes towards a baptism ritual, and his \\"Liber CVI\\" was written for use in a last rites circumstance. The Bishops of the contemporary Church have developed rituals for all of these purposes, as well as infant benedictions, consecration of holy oil, funerals, and home administration of the Eucharist to the sick. Although some Gnostic Masses are held privately for initiates only, there is nothing 'secret' about E.G.C. rituals as such, and they are commonly open to the public. Saints of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica The Gnostic Saints of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica are a series of historical and mythological figures revered in the religion of Thelema. They are found in the fifth Collect of Liber XV, titled \\"The Saints\\". Two Gnostic Saints have been officially added to the original list. William Blake was so recognized based on a discovered writing by Aleister Crowley which described him as such.Helena and Tau Apiryon The Gnostic Mass: Annotations and Commentary (footnote). Ordo Templi Orientis, 2004. Giordano Bruno was more recently added to the list.Sabazius. \\"From the Grand Master\\" in Agape, V. 9, No. 1, p. 3. Ordo Templi Orientis, May 1, 2007. History The Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica descended from a line of French Gnostic revival churches that developed in the 19th century. At that time, these Gnostic churches were essentially Christian in nature. In 1907, Gerard Encausse, Jean Bricaud and Louis-Sophrone Fugairon founded their own, simply called the Gnostic Catholic Church. In 1908, they gave O.T.O. Grand Master Theodor Reuss episcopal consecration and primatial authority in their GCC. Later that year, Reuss incorporated the Gnostic Catholic Church into O.T.O. after the original founders renamed their own church to the Universal Gnostic Church. The name \\"Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica\\" was not applied to the church until Crowley wrote the Gnostic Mass in 1913, which Reuss proclaimed to be the church's official rite. This marked the first time an established church was to accept the Law of Thelema as its central doctrine. Reuss then announced a new title for himself: the \\"Sovereign Patriarch and Primate of the Gnostic Catholic Church\\". In 1979, Hymenaeus Alpha X¬∞ (Grady McMurtry) separated Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica from Ordo Templi Orientis, and made it into an independent organization, with himself at the head of both. During this period of separation Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica published its own quarterly magazine. However, in 1986, his successor, Hymenaeus Beta, dissolved the separate Gnostic Catholic Church corporation and folded the church back into O.T.O. Since then the Church has expanded greatly, and in recent years several books and articles dealing with the E.G.C. and the Gnostic Mass have been published by its Clergy, notably by Tau Apiryon & Tau Helena, James Wasserman & Nancy Wasserman, Rodney Orpheus & Cathryn Orchard, and T Polyphilus. The Gnostic Creed A creed is a statement of belief‚Äîusually religious belief‚Äîor faith. The word derives from the Latin credo for \\"I believe\\". The creed of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica‚Äîalso known as the Gnostic Creed‚Äîis recited in the Gnostic Mass, during the Ceremony of the Introit. The text of the Creed is as follows: ::I believe in one secret and ineffable LORD; and in one Star in the Company of Stars of whose fire we are created, and to which we shall return; and in one Father of Life, Mystery of Mystery, in His name CHAOS, the sole vicegerent of the Sun upon the Earth; and in one Air the nourisher of all that breathes. ::And I believe in one Earth, the Mother of us all, and in one Womb wherein all men are begotten, and wherein they shall rest, Mystery of Mystery, in Her name BABALON. ::And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mystery, in His name BAPHOMET. ::And I believe in one Gnostic and Catholic Church of Light, Life, Love and Liberty, the Word of whose Law is THELEMA. ::And I believe in the communion of Saints. ::And, forasmuch as meat and drink are transmuted in us daily into spiritual substance, I believe in the Miracle of the Mass. ::And I confess one Baptism of Wisdom whereby we accomplish the Miracle of Incarnation. ::And I confess my life one, individual, and eternal that was, and is, and is to come. ::AUMGN. AUMGN. AUMGN. =Explication of the Creed= The first six articles profess several beliefs by the congregants. The remaining two are confessions. The Creed ends with the Thelemic form of the Pranava, equivalent to the sacred Vedic syllable \\"Aum\\" or to the \\"Amen\\" of the Judaeo-Christian tradition. On the basic form of the Creed, Tau Apiryon and Helena (1998) write: :The first 4 clauses are attributed to the four letters of Tetragrammaton YHVH: the Father (Chaos); the Mother (Babalon); the Union of Father and Mother in the Son (Baphomet); and the Daughter, the Bride of the Son (the Church). The two following clauses describe the essential products of the Mass from the perspective of the congregation. The final two clauses are in the form of confession rather than belief and describe parallels between the occurrences in the Mass and the life of the individual.

The Rabbula Gospels, or Rabula Gospels, (Florence, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, cod. Plut. I, 56) is a 6th-century illuminated Syriac Gospel Book. One of the finest Byzantine works produced in Asia, and one of the earliest Christian manuscripts with large miniatures, it is distinguished by the miniaturist's predilection for bright colours, movement, drama, and expressionism. Coming from a period from which little art survives, and which saw great development in Christian iconography, the manuscript has a significant place in art history, and is very often referred to. Recent scholarship has suggested that the manuscript completed in 586 was later partly overpainted by restorers and bound together with miniatures from other sources in the 15th or 16th century.  Description  The earliest crucifixion in an illuminated manuscript, from the Rabbula Gospels. The Gospel was completed in 586 at Monastery of St. John of Zagba (Syriac: , '), which, although traditionally thought to have been in Northern Mesopotamia, is now thought to have been in the hinterland between Antioch and Apamea in modern Syria. It was signed by its scribe, Rabbula (, ') about whom nothing else is known. In their current condition the folios are 34 cm (13.4 in) by 27 cm (10.6 in). Their original size is unknown because they were trimmed during previous rebindings. The text is written in black or dark brown ink in two columns of a variable number of lines. There are footnotes written in red ink at the bottom of many of the columns. The text is the Peshitta version of the Syriac translation of the Gospels. The manuscript is illuminated, with the text framed in elaborate floral and architectural motifs. The Gospel canons are set in arcades ornamented with flowers and birds. The miniaturist obviously drew some of his inspiration from Hellenistic art (draped figures), but relied mainly on the ornamental traditions of Persia. The miniatures of the Rabbula Gospels, notably those representing the Crucifixion, the Ascension and Pentecost, are real pictures with a decorative frame formed of zigzags, curves, rainbows and so forth. The scene of the Crucifixion is the earliest to survive in an illuminated manuscript, and shows the Eastern form of the image at the time. There is a miniature of the Apostles choosing a new twelfth member (after the loss of Judas); this is not an event found in the Canonical Gospels (though it is mentioned in Chapter 1 of Acts) and is almost never seen in later art. The artist was trained in the classical illusionist tradition, and is a competent and practiced hand rather than an outstanding talent; but surviving images from this period are so rare that his are extremely valuable for showing the style and iconography of his age. Folio 4v of the Rabbula Gospels showing the canon tables, harmonization of the four gospels, with marginal miniatures. The French Orientalist Edgard Blochet (1870‚Äì1937) argued that some of the folios of the manuscript, including the pictorial series, were an interpolation no earlier than the 10th or 11th century. Since the original caption accompanying the miniatures is of the same paleographic character as the main text of the manuscript, this theory was rejected by Giuseppe Furlani and by Carlo Cecchelli in the commentary of the facsimile edition of the miniatures published in 1959.Miniatures from the Rabbula Gospels ms. But doubts as to the original unity of the contents continued.Wright, David H. \\"The Date and Arrangement of the Illustrations in the Rabbula Gospels.\\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers 27 (1973): 197-208. Web., JSTOR More recently, scholars have proposed that the text of 586 was only bound up together with the miniatures in the 15th century, and that the miniatures themselves were taken from at least one other original manuscript, and come from two different campaigns of work.Peers, Glenn, Review of Bernab√≤ (see Further reading) The history of the manuscript after it was written is vague until the 11th century when it was at Maipuc-Byblos, Lebanon. In the late 13th or early 14th century it came to Quannubin. In the late 15th or early 16th century, the manuscript was taken by the Maronite Patriarch to the Laurentian Library in Florence, where it is today.

Climbing career  He first started climbing on the Sandstone-rocks of the 'S√ºdpfalz'. Soon he became one of the best climbers in this region and made the first free ascent of Jubil√§umsriss (VII-) at the age of 16. He travelled to the Elbsandsteingebirge, and to the Shawangunks and Yosemite Valley, US, where he could climb most of the top routes of each area, including a 2nd ascent of Grand Illusion (5.13b/c). Later he moved to the Frankenjura (Germany) and created a great number of hard climbing routes such as: * Kanal im R√ºcken, 1984, first X (8b) in history, Frankenjura (DEU) * Punks in the Gym, Apr 1985, first X+ (8b+) in history, Mount Arapiles (AUS) * Amadeus Schwarzenegger, 1986, rated X (8b), Frankenjura (DEU) * Wallstreet, 1987, first XI- (8c) in history, Frankenjura (DEU) * Action Directe, Aug 1991, first XI (9a) in history, Frankenjura (DEU). Still considered one of the hardest routes worldwide. G√ºllich added several grades to the grading system. In fact, with the exception of Ben Moon's Hubble (the world's first 8c+), Wolfgang was responsible for 4 consecutive step-ups, with the world's first 8b (Kanal im R√ºcken, 1984), 8b+ (Punks in the Gym, 1985), 8c (Wallstreet, 1987), and 9a (Action Directe, 1991). However, it is important to note that this exception only exists on the French grade system, while for the UIAA system that G√ºllich himself used, the four steps were consecutive without exception (X, X+, XI-, XI). While training for Action Directe, G√ºllich invented the modern training technique of campus boarding to prepare his fingers for the grueling overhung crimps. He hung the first campus board at a N√ºrnberg gym named \\"Campus\\" in 1988, and made the first ascent three years later. He worked with his friend and fellow climber Jerry Moffatt who found that the power training greatly improved a climber's endurance. In addition to his sport climbing endeavours, G√ºllich put up the first ascents of iconic routes like Eternal Flame (IX- A2) in the Karakoram and Riders on the Storm (IX A3) in Patagonia. The boldness of these routes showed that he excelled at difficult mountain routes as well as one-pitch sports climbs. He broke his back falling off the Master's Edge at Millstone Quarry in Derbyshire, England but when he recovered, in 1986, he became the first man to free solo Separate Reality, , a twenty-foot horizontal crack in an overhanging roof in Yosemite National Park, USA. Personal life In 1990 he met his future wife Anette, whom he married one year later. He was a climbing double for Sylvester Stallone in the 1993 movie Cliffhanger, along with Ron Kauk. On August 29, 1992 Wolfgang fell asleep at the wheel of his car and veered off the Autobahn between Munich and Nuremberg as he made his way home from an interview. Two days later he died in a hospital in Ingolstadt, never having regained consciousness.

He was signed by the Seattle Seahawks as an undrafted free agent in 1998 and also played for the Barcelona Dragons, Philadelphia Eagles and Atlanta Falcons. He played college football at Villanova. Early years Finneran attended Santa Margarita Catholic High School in Rancho Santa Margarita, California, and finished his three-year career there with a school career-record 177 receptions. Finneran received scholarship offers to play college football for the Oregon Ducks and Oregon State Beavers. However, the only school to offer a football scholarship to both Finneran and his twin brother was Villanova. College career Finneran and his identical twin brother, Brad, played college football for Villanova University and were lettermen. As a senior, Finneran had 96 receptions for 1,389 yards, earning All-American honors from the Associated Press and being awarded the Walter Payton Award, which is given to the nation's top Division I-AA offensive player. He had 265 receptions for 3,872 yards and 34 touchdowns over his entire college career. He had his number 25 jersey retired by Villanova in the fall of 2003. Professional career Prior to joining the Falcons, Finneran played for the NFL Europa Barcelona Dragons where he was named All-NFL Europe. After coming to America and joining the Falcons, he proved to be a consistent possession receiver. Finneran tore ligaments in his left knee during Falcons practice on July 30, 2006 and missed the entire 2006 season. He missed his second straight season after tearing the reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. Before injuries forced him to miss the previous two seasons, he was the preferred target of quarterback Michael Vick despite generally starting in the slot receiver position. He returned to the field in 2008 but did not start and saw limited action. He was re-signed to a one-year contract on February 11, 2010.

Property not affixed to real property is considered chattel property. Fixtures are treated as a part of real property, particularly in the case of a security interest. A classic example of a fixture is a building, which, in the absence of language to the contrary in a contract of sale, is considered part of the land itself and not a separate piece of property. Generally speaking the test for deciding whether an article is a fixture or a chattel turns on the purpose of attachment. If the purpose was to enhance the land the article is likely a fixture. If the article was affixed to enhance the use of the chattel itself, the article is likely a chattel. Chattel property is converted into a fixture by the process of attachment. For example, if a piece of lumber sits in a lumber yard it is a chattel. If the same lumber is used to build a fence on the land it becomes a fixture to that real property. In many cases, the determination of whether property is a fixture or a chattel turns on the degree to which the property is attached to the land. For example, this problem arises in the case of a trailer home. In this case the characterization of the home as chattel or realty will depend on how permanently it is attached, such as whether the trailer has a foundation. The characterization of property as a fixture or as chattel is important. In most jurisdictions, the law respecting the registration of security against debt, or proof that money has been lent on the collateral of property, is different for chattels than it is for real property. For example, in the province of Ontario, Canada, mortgages against real property must be registered in the county or region's land titles office. However, mortgages against chattels must be registered in the province-wide registry set up under the Personal Property Security Act. In the case of a trailer home, whether it is a fixture or chattel has a bearing on whether a real property mortgage applies to the trailer. For example, most mortgages contain a clause that forbids the borrower from removing or demolishing fixtures on the property, which would lower the value of the security. However, there have been cases where lenders lend money based on the value of the trailer home on the property, where that trailer is later removed from the property. Similarly, a chattel mortgage granted to allow a person to purchase a trailer home could be lost if the trailer is later attached to real property. The law regarding fixtures can also cause many problems with property held under a lease. Fixtures put in place by the tenant belong to the landlord if the tenant is evicted from the property. This is the case even if the fixture could have legally been removed by the tenant while the lease was in good standing. For example, a chandelier hung by the tenant may become the property of the landlord. Although this example is trivial, there have been cases where heavy equipment incorporated into a plant has been deemed to have become fixtures even though it was sold as chattels. Because the value of fixtures often exceeds the value of the land they are affixed to, lawsuits to determine whether a particular item is a chattel or a fixture are common. In one case in Canada, a provincial government argued that a huge earth dam was a chattel, as it was only held in place by gravity and not by any type of affixation (the claim was rejected). In a sale of land, fixtures are treated as part of the land, and may not be removed or altered by the seller prior to the transfer of the land. Fixtures are known in civil law as essential parts.Section 93 of the German Civil Code: > \\"Section 93 Essential parts of a thing > \\"Parts of a thing that cannot be separated without one or the other being > destroyed or undergoing a change of nature (essential parts) cannot be the > subject of separate rights. Trade fixtures An important exception to the usual treatment of fixtures is the category of trade fixtures (often called \\"chattel\\" fixtures), chattels installed by a tenant on leased commercial property specifically for their use in a trade or business. These may always be removed by the tenant, so long as any damage to the structure caused by the removal is repaid or repaired. For example, business signage, display counters, store shelves, liquor bars, and machining equipment are often firmly, if not almost permanently, attached to the building or land. However, they remain personal property and can be removed by the tenant, since they are part of the tenant's business. The economic logic behind this exception for trade fixtures reckons that if tenants could not remove them, then landlords would bear the responsibility of outfitting their tenants with such equipment and materials. By deduction, therefore, a trade fixture is not a fixture at all. Its name is misleading, since a fixture, by definition, is real property that must remain with the real estate when a seller sells it or a tenant leaves her lease. A trade \\"fixture\\" is not real property, but personal property of the tenant. The landlord does have some protection. Any damage to the real property caused by the tenant‚Äôs removal of trade fixtures must be repaired or paid for by the tenant. If a trade fixture is not removed when the tenant moves out, those trade fixtures become the landlord‚Äôs property through the process of accession. For example, if a restaurant goes bankrupt and the owner forgoes his right and the expense of removing all the kitchen equipment, dining booths and other trade fixtures, those trade fixtures become the landlord's property. In this manner, they will no longer be trade fixtures and can actually become regular fixtures, hence real property.

Stone (June 17, 1915 ‚Äì February 6, 2012), also known as Charlie Stone, was a career United States Army officer during the middle of the 20th century. After serving in World War II, in 1968 Major General Stone commanded the U.S. Army's 4th Infantry Division in Vietnam, leading his division to success during the Tet offensive. Early life Stone grew up in Queens, New York and he attended the City College of New York. Military career He joined the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) and then competed for a Regular Army commission under the federal Thomason Act. This legislation enabled a thousand top ROTC graduates to compete for 50 commissions during a year of active duty. For 1937-38, 41 were selected, including Stone. He served in North Africa and Sicily in World War II. =Vietnam War= High self- regard Stone was known for high self-regard. \\"I suppose I'm probably the most confident commander in Vietnam, but I think in the Highlands we are beating the hell out of the enemy,\\" he told a war correspondent in 1968. He also said later,\\"I was the best division commander in Vietnam.\\" His division had a three-week advance notice of the Tet Offensive attacks thanks to its capture in early January 1968 of \\"a five-page plan of movement and attack for Pleiku Province.\\" Units were placed on alert and tanks in Pleiku were positioned \\"as a reaction force against the invaders.\\" Stone also briefed American officers and the area Vietnamese commander before the North Vietnamese attack. During the Tet Offensive, according to one account, \\"the highest kill ratio registered was in the three highland provinces of the Cambodian border . . . where the enemy lost nearly 3000 troops, the United States fewer than fifty, and the ARVN [Army of the Republic of Vietnam] about 145.\\" Stone's division operated in these provinces. Before departing his command of the 4th Infantry Division, he had a caustic farewell message printed in Vietnamese on leaflets and air-dropped to enemy troops. The message read, in part: \\"I also take with me sad memories. I recall seeing thousands of North Vietnamese sent to their death by the stupid tactics of your leaders . . . If your leaders continue their wasteful practice and stupid tactics, my successor will also have a successful tour . . .\\" \\"Salute or shoot\\" Despite his combat successes, Stone's tour in Vietnam was marred by controversy over his order that soldiers at the division base camp cited for failing to salute \\"will be immediately transferred to the forward area.\\" The order had taken effect after Stone had assumed command of the 4th Division in January 1968, but only appeared in print in September in a daily divisional bulletin. The order garnered media attention in America and Stone said in an interview the Defense Department told him \\"the country is aroused over your saluting policy\\" so he withdrew it. According to The New York Times, Stone \\"said he had also rescinded similar orders that sent to forward areas soldiers who had their driver's licenses revoked or who violated off-limits and curfew regulations.\\" The general also noted, with apparent bitterness, that unlike in World War II, where soldiers could be sent to a distinct front, \\"Here the front is all around us. Where is the front? There is no front.\\" In retirement, Stone said the Pentagon should have addressed \\"the basic misconception\\" in the controversy. As he put it, (as a division commander) \\"Stone is responsible for the lives of 22,000 men, twenty-four hours a day. . . . Permissiveness in the army, much less insolence and recalcitrance, cannot be tolerated. The military virtues are obedience and discipline at all times so that they can be counted on when absolutely necessary for the security of army units and the success of their missions.\\" Personal life and retirement He was married and had a daughter. He was an active outdoorsman and spent most of his retirement on a farm in Mathews, Virginia.

Although Valium did gain substantial recognition from the underground comics scene in Europe and North-America since his beginnings in the early 1980s, his provocative and hallucinogenic style has kept him well away from the mainstream comic book industry. Biography Spanning over a career of three decades, Valium's creations are widely dispersed through numerous anthologies, fanzines, self- published comics, and various mixed-media collaborations, which makes it difficult to establish a detailed chronology of his work. = The 1980s = With the exception of Vagorbine 14 (1981), his first self-published title, Valium's early incursions into the comic book world can be found through various Quebec compilations and fanzines like Motel, Tchiize and Rectangle. One notable contribution during that period was made to Iceberg (1984), in which he introduces himself for the first time under the pseudonym \\"Henriette Valium\\". Many of the stories written during the 1980s were compiled into 1000 Rectums, It's an Album (1987), a self-published anthology. The book introduces many themes and characters that will become the author's trademarks over the years. In particular, Valium brings in some of his most recognizable protagonists, such as his alter-ego Pattou, the enigmatic Mister Iceberg, and the evil scientist Doc Lekron. The stories, often one-page short, mostly revolves around Valium's usual themes, mainly sickness, addictions, abnormal sexuality and social decay in general. Even though the drawings are strongly marked by a penchant towards punk aesthetics, 1000 Rectums does not yet exhibit the complex and violent graphical excess that will characterize later publications such as Primitive Cr√©tin. = The 1990s = Along with a brief punk rock experiment as a singer for Valium et les D√©pressifs and the subsequent release of C'est un monstre (1992), the early 1990s were a prolific period that led to the creation of Primitive Cr√©tin! (1993), a self-published 11.5\\" by 17.5\\" anthology. The book, which probably constitutes Valium's most widely recognized work up to date, is a collection of demented and often absurd stories that carry on with the themes and characters of 1000 Rectums, along with the addition of short-lived yet memorable characters like The Boxing-Glove Family or Tiplouplou. The truly remarkable feature of the book, however, lies within its staggering surreal drawings. Each page of Primitive Cr√©tin! is a world onto itself, in which images of strange organisms, distorted everyday objects, and extreme urban density are intertwined to create a general impression of disorder. The complexity of the drawings combined with their considerable scale generate an immersive chaotic environment that is almost impossible to decode at first glance. In order to achieve this effect in Primitive Cr√©tin! and his other comics in general, Valium has to work for several months on each page. Thus, the conception of a whole comic book represents a long and strenuous process that can take up to 6 years. In addition to frequent collaborations with various independent zines across Europe and North America, such as Zero Zero (which led to a US reprinting of Primitive Cr√©tin! in 1996), Valium also started by the mid-1990s to experiment more formally with collage, which moved his art toward a more abstract and horrific form. Among the interesting collages of that period, we find La Prison Anale des Fr√®res Rouges (1996) and the Cur√©s Malades (\\"sick priests\\") series. The later, through the depiction of machine parts and pornography blended over portraits of priests, is a gloomy and graphic criticism on the Catholic Church‚Äôs historical influence in Quebec. Valium‚Äôs collage work, with its incorporation of explicit sexual imagery (often going as far as bestiality) and gruesome press photos, has prevented him from getting any kind of public recognition, including government subsidies. Since the 1980s, Valium has mostly made a living from printing posters for various Montreal rock bands and bars, such as Le Caf√© Campus and Les Foufounes √âlectriques. = Recent work = The year 2000 was marked by the publication of Coeur de Maman (\\"Mother‚Äôs Heart\\"), a self-published 11.5\\" by 17.5\\" silkscreened comic book. Coeur de Maman, a bizarre story about an oversized, monstrous mother's heart, picks up where Primitive Cr√©tin left, with the pages being so heavily illustrated that they become almost unreadable. In the same year, Valium also completed The Survivor, a monumental painting centered on a Joseph Goebbels family picture that was shown at Gallery Clark (Montreal) along with Les Cur√©s Malades, and several other works. Finally, he also participated, in the spring of 2000, in an exhibition of his work at the La Luz de Jesus gallery in Los Angeles. More recently, Valium has kept experimenting with collage, integrating Photoshop into his creations, which led among other things to a series of serigraphs titled Les H√©ritiers du R√™ve (2002), and the small books Mutants I (2002) and Mutants II (2003). His latest comic book, Princesse Brune (\\"Brown Princess\\"), was completed in 2006. His most recent collage, Djoker, was shown at the Voltigeur gallery in Toulouse in the summer of the same year. Valium is currently working on Mutants III, a tribute to Hans Bellmer, which will mainly consist of pornographic computer collages. In spring 2007, L'Association from France plan to publish a complete anthology of his comics. Another French collective, Le Dernier Cri, are working on a box set that will include the book from L'Association, an audio cd, and an anthology of all his drawings and paintings. Valium's web site was finalized in February 2007. In March 2013, some of Valium's art pieces were exposed at Espace Robert Poulin in Montreal.

It is situated on US Highway 41 (US 41) about south of the village of L'Anse at . Alberta is the site of the Ford Forestry Center and Research Forest, managed by the Michigan Technological University School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science. The community was founded in 1936 after Henry Ford declared the banks of the Plumbago Creek to be an ideal spot for a sawmill. Ford named the town \\"Alberta\\" after the daughter of the superintendent of Ford's Upper Peninsula Operations at the time, which was either Fred J. Johnson or Edward G. Kingsford (for whom the town of Kingsford, Michigan and Kingsford charcoal is named). It was Ford's intention to have a model lumber and sawmill town, as well as to construct a plant in the southeastern forests of the Keweenaw.Ford Center in AlbertaAt the time Ford established Alberta, wood was used extensively in automobiles. The original village of Alberta consisted of twelve houses, two schools, and a steam-driven mill built to the most modern standards of the day. The Plumbago Creek was dammed to provide a reservoir to serve the town and mill's water supply needs. The mill was a two-story white clapboard wood frame structure and still stands, now housing a portion of the Alberta Village Museum. The saw mill had a capacity of per day for hardwood and per day for softwood. This was a small capacity even by 1936 standards, with Ford's other three mills in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan producing twenty to twenty-five times as much. Those who resided in Alberta were expected to divide their time lumbering, milling, and farming. Similarities exist between both the Ford-established and administered communities of Alberta and the town of Belterra, in the Brazilian state of Par√°. It has been professionally noted that both towns were established by the Ford Motor Company around generally the same time. Both provided much-needed resources for the construction of the Model T, Alberta was a supplier of wood, and Belterra, a provider of rubber to the company. Ford had closed the operations in the community around the year 1943, and the community gradually began to diminish, although it was not until the year of 1954 that the sawmill ceased its operations, and the Ford Motor Company officially donated the town of Alberta, Michigan, and the of land around it to what is now the School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science at Michigan Technological University. Buildings still standing that were part of the original village on this property are now used as a museum, they also support research and serve as a hub for teaching programs for those with forestry and ecology majors, the buildings are also used by numerous universities from around the United States for forestry education.

Ramarama has an off-ramp at exit 466 on the motorway south of Auckland. The suburb is effectively sliced in two by the motorway, this section of which was constructed in 1978. The main settlement of Ramarama contains a convenience store, a caravan park and several small businesses. Most of the land in the area is made up of market gardens, farms and lifestyle blocks as would be expected from the entirely rural region in which it is located.

The median age was 45.2 years, with 351 people (17.8%) aged under 15 years, 348 (17.6%) aged 15 to 29, 996 (50.4%) aged 30 to 64, and 285 (14.4%) aged 65 or older. Ethnicities were 86.0% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 11.8% MƒÅori, 5.0% Pacific peoples, 6.8% Asian, and 1.7% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). The proportion of people born overseas was 18.4%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 53.7% had no religion, 36.6% were Christian, 1.2% were Hindu, 1.1% were Muslim, 0.3% were Buddhist and 2.4% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 378 (23.2%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 276 (17.0%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $42,500. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 906 (55.7%) people were employed full-time, 267 (16.4%) were part-time, and 36 (2.2%) were unemployed. History Ramarama was originally only bushland and also there was a pƒÅ site inhabited by the NgƒÅti Pou tribe of the MƒÅori. It also hid pathways between Tamaki, Hauraki and the Waikato. In the 1850s, the British built the Great South Road through the land. At the time of the Waikato War, the area was known as Sheppards Bush. Reverend McDonald, a famed priest at the time, decided to build a church, where the Pratts Road Cemetery stands now. The church was called Saint Brigids and also functioned as a school. The church itself was moved to Selwyn Oaks, but the school was called Maketu School and henceforth Ramarama School. The Te Maketu Waterfall is hidden behind the Pratts Road Cemetery. Reverend McDonald wrote a book on it called ‚ÄúThe Well Known Secret of the Waterfall‚Äù. * Country Women's Institute The Ramarama branch of the Country Women's Institute, like many women's CWI groups across New Zealand supported the women and their families in the area. First formed in Ramarama on May 10th 1933, it took a very active part in raising money for the building of the Ramarama Hall. They held a Queen Carnival and took an active part in all other fund raising for the project.

As most of the English and Irish immigrants were Catholic it was decided that a church be opened for bible and Sunday school sessions. In the suburb of Ramarama, the Drury Stevensons Quarry is located about five to ten minutes from Pratts Road Cemetery. This is a multimillion-dollar business, which produces 84,000 tons of rock and aggregates. Notable people Jane Mander, novelist, was born in Ramarama on 9 April 1877.

Although the All- Russian Congress of Soviets had supreme authority, in periods between its sessions its powers were passed to VTsIK. Organization The 1918 Russian Constitution required that the VTsIK convene the All-Russian Congress of Soviets no fewer than two times a year (Statute 26 of Article III).1918 Constitution of the R.S.F.S.R., Article III Additional Congresses could be called by the VTsIK or on the request of local Soviets. The VTsIK was elected by a full Congress, with no more than 200 individuals. It was completely subordinate to the Congress. The functions of the Collegiate or the Presidium were not declared in the Constitution, but presumably they were supposed to be purely supervisory or revisionary bodies. Provisions VTsIK gave a general direction for the policies of the Worker-Peasant government and all bodies of the Soviet power in the country. It united and coordinated activities for legislation and administration as well as supervised the endorsement of the Soviet Constitution, declarations of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets and central bodies of the Soviet power. The All-Russian Central Executive Committee reviewed and adopted the projects of decrees and other propositions introduced by the Council of People's Commissars and separate departments as well as issued its own decrees and instructions. VTsIK summoned the All- Russian Congress of Soviets to which it presented the reports on its activity, general policy, and other inquiries. The All-Russian Central Executive Committee formed the Council of People's Commissars for general administrative affairs of the republic and departments (called People's Commissariats) for the management of separate branches of administration. Deputies of the VTsIK worked in the departments or executed special assignments of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. The state budget was defined by both VTsIK and All-Russian Congress of Soviets together, in addition to defining the budgets of different regions, districts, towns and cities. History The All-Russian Central Executive Committee was first elected at the First All-Russian Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies' Soviets, held in Petrograd, June 3‚Äì24, 1917. The first Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets was not a governing body and its chairman Nikolai Chkheidze was not the head of Russian state. This changed at the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets during the October Revolution. The Second All-Russian Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies' Soviets held in Petrograd in November 1917 elected the second Central Executive Committee. This then became the executive body of the RSFSR. It was composed of :62 Bolsheviks :29 Left SRs :10 Mensheviks and Right SRsEncyclopedia of Marxism: Glossary of Organisations, marxists.org, accessed 1 March 2018 The first chairman of the VTsIK was Lev Kamenev, who directed the day-to-day work of the Committee.

He is mostly remembered for his 12-year stay with his hometown club Sunderland, where he made 363 league appearances between 1992 and 2004. While with Sunderland, he spent a brief loan spell with Scottish side Celtic. In 2004, he moved to Blackburn Rovers and later had spells with Leeds United, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Sheffield Wednesday. In 1999, Gray earned three caps for England. Club career =Sunderland= While at school, Gray had trials with Manchester United and signed schoolboy forms, but decided against signing a contract at Old Trafford and continued playing for Fatfield Juniors F.C. in the Hetton Youth League. After 18 months he signed, as an apprentice, with Sunderland. He broke into the Sunderland first team shortly after his 18th birthday, at the beginning of the 1992‚Äì93 season. He made his senior debut on 21 November 1992 in a 1‚Äì0 win at Derby County in Division One (the first season after the creation of the new Premier League). He played in various positions, including as a striker, left winger and left back before fading slightly from first team affairs. It was not until 1995‚Äì96 that he came to the fore, starting every game for Sunderland, invariably on the left side of midfield, as the team won promotion to the Premier League as Division One champions. Gray was also the scorer of their first Premier League goal, scoring the seventh-minute opener in a 4‚Äì1 win over Nottingham Forest at the City Ground on 21 August 1996. Gray continued to be a regular in the side in 1996‚Äì97, but the club was relegated after just one year in the top flight. Gray gained unwanted attention a year later, in May 1998, when he missed the decisive penalty during a shoot-out in the First Division playoff final after a 4‚Äì4 draw with Charlton Athletic, which could have taken Sunderland back into the Premier League. Sunderland finished first in Division One the following season and won promotion to the Premiership, with Gray an ever-present for the campaign. As a First Division player, he was picked by Kevin Keegan to make his international debut for England as a substitute in the match against Hungary on 28 April 1999. In June 1999, he also played for England against Sweden and started the match against Bulgaria. He was the last outfield player from outside of the English top- flight to appear for England until David Nugent in 2007 (goalkeeper David James played for England in 2003 whilst playing for West Ham in the First Division). However, he failed to make the England squad for Euro 2000. This did not affect his domestic team's form, however, as they finished in seventh place in the Premiership, a feat repeated in 2000‚Äì01. In the 2001‚Äì02 season, Sunderland struggled, and with their dip in form came a dip in form for Gray, and for the next two seasons, he was constantly rumoured to be moving elsewhere including to arch-rivals Newcastle United. Relegation came for Sunderland at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season, and two games into the 2003‚Äì04 season Gray finally left, joining Celtic on 1 September 2003, on a four-month loan. However, having failed to make an impact, and generally finding himself out of the team, he moved to Blackburn Rovers on a free transfer on 1 January 2004. Following Sunderland's relegation from the Premier League in 2003, Gray was fined two weeks' wages and stripped of the captaincy by Mick McCarthy after Gray turned up to training in a new Ferrari. McCarthy viewed Gray's actions as insensitive due to the fact a number of club staff could potentially be made redundant following relegation. =Celtic= Gray had a loan spell in 2003 where he appeared 7 times in the green and white of Celtic. =Blackburn Rovers= Gray made his Blackburn Rovers debut against Chelsea in a 3‚Äì2 defeat, but constantly performed well for the team as they avoided relegation. In February 2005, he joined Leeds United on loan until the season's end. He then returned to Blackburn and in his first season back there he helped them qualify for the UEFA Cup, having established himself as a first-team regular. He later rejoined Leeds United for a second loan spell in a bid to save them from relegation, which ultimately failed as the club plunged into the third tier in 2007. =Wolverhampton Wanderers= Wolves completed the signing of Gray on an initial 12-month contract in July 2007, reuniting him with his former Sunderland manager Mick McCarthy.Gray joins Wolves After spending the early part of the season in his more traditional left-back role, he was switched to left midfield in February 2008, which immediately saw him score his first goal in almost six years, and led to a run of three goals in five games. He signed a further one-year deal to keep him at the club for the 2008‚Äì09 season,Gray signs one-year Wolves deal but featured only sporadically for the first team during a campaign that would end in promotion for them. =Sheffield Wednesday= Largely out of Wolves' first team plans, he joined fellow Championship side Sheffield Wednesday on a 30-day emergency loan on 9 January 2009.A Gray Owl This was made into a permanent deal on 2 February 2009, when he signed a contract until the end of the season.Gray to stay with Owls On the same day, he was also voted Wednesday's player of the month for January. He scored his first goal for Wednesday in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Barnsley on 8 August 2009. The 2009‚Äì10 season ended with relegation to League One after the club could only draw 2‚Äì2 in their final fixture with relegation rivals Crystal Palace. Three days later it was announced he would not be offered a new contract, which led to him announcing his playing retirement. International career Gray earned his first cap for England on 28 April 1999, coming on as a 74th minute substitute in the 1-1 friendly draw with Hungary at the N√©pstadion in Budapest. He made his competitive debut on 5 June, coming on for Graeme Le Saux at half-time in the 0-0 draw with Sweden during Euro 2000 qualifying. On 9 June, Gray made his first start for England in the 1-1 draw with Bulgaria, this was also during Euro 2000 qualifying. This turned out to be Gray's last cap for his country. He won a total of 3 caps for England but didn't manage to score any goals. Personal life Gray was involved in a fracas with Wayne Rooney in 2006 following a disagreement at the Panacea Bar and Restaurant in Manchester and was later ejected from the restaurant. In 2006, Gray became an investor in Golf Punk magazine, alongside former Sunderland teammates Phil Babb, Jason McAteer, Thomas S√∏rensen and Stephen Wright, saving the publication from closure. His nephew, Jordan Richards, is a professional footballer who plays for Southport. Gray has written a blog for the BBCMichael Gray's BBC blog.

Production commenced in late 1992 and since then over 5,700 units have been produced; most of these are the SD70M and SD70MAC models. All locomotives of this series are hood units with C-C trucks, except the SD70ACe-P4 which has a B1-1B wheel configuration, and the SD70ACe-BB, which has a B-B-B-B wheel arrangement. Superseding the HT-C truck, a new bolsterless radial HTCR truck was fitted to all EMD SD70s built 1992-2002; in 2003 the non-radial HTSC truck (basically the HTCR made less costly by removing radial components) was made standard on the SD70ACe and SD70M-2 models; the radial HTCR truck remained available as an option. Models =SD70 (1992-1994)= Illinois Central SD70 1004 The EMD SD70 typically has the smaller spartan cab, typical on preceding SD60 models, instead of the larger comfort cab used on later models. Notable differences between the SD70 and SD60 are the radial steering EMD HTCR truck instead of the older HTC truck, and the SD70's overall length of 72 ft 4in, the older SD60 being 71 ft 2 in. The SD70 also rides higher as its frame is approximately higher than the SD60. This model is equipped with direct current (DC) traction motors, which simplifies the locomotive's electrical system by obviating the need for computer-controlled inverters (as are required for alternating current (AC) power). It is equipped with the , 16-cylinder EMD 710 prime mover. One hundred and twenty-two examples of this model locomotive were produced for Norfolk Southern Railway (NS), Conrail (CR), Illinois Central Railroad (IC) and Southern Peru Copper Corporation (SPCC). Conrail's assets were split between Norfolk Southern (PRR) and CSX Transportation in 1999, and all 24 of Conrail's SD70 units went to NS. Other than the CR paint scheme these units were built to NS specifications and numbered (2557 - 2580) in series with Norfolk Southern's already purchased SD70s. Production of the standard cab at EMDs London, Ontario plant ended in 1994. The 24 Conrail SD70s were assembled from kits at Conrail's Juniata Shops in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where the IC and SPCC SD70s were assembled from kits at Super Steel Schenectady. Most SD70s are still in service with Norfolk Southern and Canadian National (CN), which merged Illinois Central in 1999. In February 2017, NS began a program to convert their SD70s from DC to AC, which will also have a new wide cab, and several other upgrades. They will be designated as SD70ACC. =SD70M (1992-2004)= A comparison of the various versions of the SD70's as operated by Union Pacific Railroad UP SD70M no. 4352 at Fairbury, Nebraska in July 2014 The SD70M has a wide nose and a large comfort cab (officially known as the \\"North American Safety Cab\\"), allowing crew members to ride more comfortably inside of the locomotive than the older standard cab designs. There are two versions of this cab on SD70Ms: the Phase 1 cab, which was first introduced on the SD60M, and the Phase 2 cab, which is a boxier design similar to the original three-piece windscreen on the SD60M, which is shared with the Phase 2 SD90MAC, SD89MAC, and SD80ACe. The Phase 2 cab has a two-piece windscreen like the Phase 1 windscreen but the design of the nose is more boxy, with a taller square midsection for more headroom. The SD70M is equipped with D90TR DC traction motors and the 710G3B prime mover. They are capable of generating of continuous tractive effort. From mid-2000, the SD70M was produced with SD45-style flared radiators allowing for the larger radiator cores needed for split-cooling. Split-cooling is a feature that separates the coolant circuit for the prime mover and the circuit for the air pumps and turbocharger. There are two versions of this radiator: the older version has two large radiator panels on each side, and the newer version has four square panels on each side. This modification was made in response to the enactment of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Tier 1 environmental regulations. Also the truck was replaced with HTCR-4, instead of HTCR-I on former model. Production of the SD70M ceased in late 2004 as production of the SD70M-2 model began (the EPA's Tier 2 regulations went into effect on 1 January 2005). 1,609 examples of the SD70M model were produced. Purchasers included CSXT, New York Susquehanna & Western (NYSW; part of EMDX order no. 946531), Norfolk Southern and Southern Pacific (SP; now part of the Union Pacific Railroad), but the vast majority were purchased by Union Pacific. An order of SD70Ms made history when Union Pacific ordered 1000 units of the model (UP 4000 through UP 4999, inclusive, although 4014 was renumbered 4479 to accommodate steam locomotive Big Boy 4014 in 2019https://trn.trains.com/news/news-wire/2019/05/16-diesel-no-4014-gets-new- number-ahead-of-big-boy-debut ). This order was later extended by nearly 500 additional units (UP 3999 and below, UP 5000 and above, except for 3985, which was left vacant for the Union Pacific Challenger 3985). This locomotive model is also built for export, and is still catalogued by EMD (at ). CVG Ferrominera Orinoco has 6 SD70Ms that were built as an add-on order to UPs FIRE cab equipped SD70Ms. Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) in Brazil has ordered 55 of this model for service in Carajas pulling trainloads of iron ore. Since CVRD track is gauged at , a wider bogie, the HTSC2, was designed for these units by EMD. =SD70I (1995)= Canadian National SD70I 5619 in Winnipeg The SD70I is a version of the SD70M which has been fitted with a cab that is isolated from the frame of the locomotive with rubber gaskets (officially known as a \\"WhisperCab\\"). The isolation reduces noise and vibration from the prime mover. A seam is visible across the nose and on the long hood where the cab connects with the body. 26 examples of this model locomotive were produced, all for Canadian National Railway. The WhisperCab feature was incorporated into some SD70MACs and was standard on both the SD80MAC and SD90/43MAC models. =SD70MAC (1993-2000)= Transportaci√≥n Ferroviaria Mexicana SD70MAC 1627 at Nueva Italia station Conrail \\"White Smiley\\" SD-70MAC seen in Cleveland, Ohio with an autorack train The SD70MAC uses three phase AC traction motors. Production of the model commenced in 1993, competing against the GE Dash 9-44CW. The majority of SD70MAC models were produced with the EMD 710 prime mover while later units are rated at and feature EMD SD45-style flared radiators. The Alaska Railroad ordered their locomotives with head-end power to make them suitable for both freight and passenger service; no other railroad ordered this variant. The trucks were replaced with HTCR-4, instead of HTCR-I on former model. CSX 4761 with EMD SD45-style flared radiators leading a stack train. The SD70MAC is no longer produced due to EPA regulations, and was replaced by the SD70ACe in 2004. In total, 1,109 SD70MACs were produced, purchased by Burlington Northern Railroad (and its successor, BNSF Railway), Conrail, CSX Transportation, Transportaci√≥n Ferroviaria Mexicana (TFM; units now owned by Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS)), and the Alaska Railroad. =SD70ACe (2004-present) = BNSF Railway SD70ACe no. 8794 coupled to an SD70MAC, providing a good comparison of the two models. The SD70ACe is the successor to the SD70MAC with design changes to comply with emission standards. The engine fires with 15% lower internal pressure to improve emissions and features fewer internal components in the inverter. SD70ACe is equipped with EMD's 16-710-G3C-T2 prime mover, rated at ; later Tier 3 models are rated at . They are rated at continuous tractive effort ( starting). Braking effort is rated at . Ferromex 4079 SD70ACe in Le√≥n, Guanajuato Ferrosur SD70ACe locomotive 4124, equipped with experimental sheet-metal awnings over the radiator air intakes In 2012, EMD also built four models known as the SD70ACe-P6. These units, unlike previous SD70ACe's, have one inverter per axle on the trucks, rather than EMD's traditional one inverter per truck design. In 2014, BNSF Railway took delivery of 20 SD70ACe-P4 units, numbered 8500-8519. This model was designed with a B1-1B wheel arrangement to compete with GE's ES44C4 model, which has an A1A-A1A wheel arrangement. Two of EMD's demonstrator SD70ACe-P4's went to Tacoma Rail in late 2014 for a 5-year lease. On January 1, 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Tier 4 locomotive emission regulations went into effect. EMD could not successfully modify the SD70ACe's 2-stroke 710 series prime mover to be Tier 4-compliant; thus, the Tier 3 SD70ACe was succeeded by the SD70ACe-T4 in late 2015. However, US production of the Tier 3-compliant SD70ACe continues with Tier 4 'credit units' (new Tier 3-compliant units EMD is entitled to build based on previously-earned emissions credits). Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern are currently the only US roads to own Tier 4 credit unit SD70ACe's. Additionally, EMD has continued building Tier 3 SD70ACe's for Ferromex (4100-4118), Ferrosur (4119-4133), and Kansas City Southern de Mexico (4200-4224) at Bombardier's locomotive plant in Ciudad Sahag√∫n, Mexico. These locomotives are restricted to Mexico-only operation and cannot cross the US border (just as Canadian National's newest Tier 3 GE ES44AC's are restricted to Canadian use only). In March 2016, EMD replaced the standard cast HTCR-4 trucks on NS SD70ACe 1000 with the new fabricated HTCR-6 trucks for testing. UP and BNSF plan to test the new HTCR-6 trucks on some of their SD70ACe units also. Union Pacific Railroad received 273 additional SD70ACe units in 2014 and 2016. These are referred to as SD70AH (T4C) , H for Heavy, because they are ballasted to 428,000 lbs instead of the standard \\"ACe's\\" 420,000 lbs. =SD70M-2 (2004-2011)= Canadian National SD70M-2 8880 in Harvey, Illinois in June 2010 The SD70M-2 is a DC traction version of the SD70ACe, and is nearly identical to the SD70ACe. Production began in 2005. SD70M-2 models are equipped with the 16-710G3C-T2 or 16-710G3C prime mover which is rated at . =SD70ACe-T4 (2015-present) = Union Pacific SD70ACe-T4 locomotive 3032 The SD70ACe-T4 is the Tier 4 emissions standards-compliant successor of the SD70ACe. The first locomotive, EMDX 1501, was built in summer 2015, and made its debut at the Railway Interchange Expo in Minneapolis, Minnesota during the weekend of October 3‚Äì4, 2015. It features a new 4-stroke engine called the EMD 12-1010 \\"J\\" series - a V12 with 1010 cu.in displacement for each cylinder. This new prime mover has a two-stage turbocharger system consisting of three turbos; one turbo (the primary/high pressure turbo) for low-mid RPM and two turbos (the secondary/low pressure turbos) for mid-high RPM. The results of this setup are higher power throughout a broader RPM range, better fuel efficiency, and lower emissions. An EGR system is applied as well, allowing the engine to achieve Tier 4 without the use of urea aftertreatment. Another new feature of this engine is the Double-Walled Fuel Injection System that increases safety and provides simplified maintenance works. The EMD 12-1010 is capable of producing 4,600 hp, but only 4,400 tractive horsepower.http://s7d2.scene7.com/is/content/Caterpillar/C10678841 With a new computer software for the on-board computer and one inverter per axle (or \\"P6\\"; EMD named it \\"Individual Axle Control\\") - unlike most of previous EMD locomotives that use one inverter per truck, the SD70ACe-T4 is capable of generating 200,000 lbf. (889.64 kN.) of starting tractive effort, and 175,000 lbf. (778.75 kN.) of continuous tractive effort. Meanwhile, its dynamic braking effort is as much as 105,000 lbf. (467.25 kN.) The amount of starting tractive effort is equal to that of the 6,000 hp SD90MAC-H while, on the other hand, its continuous tractive effort is higher than that of the SD90MAC-H (175,000 lbf. vs. 165,000 lbf.). The units are also equipped with \\"radial bogies\\" which offer increased adhesion and better ride quality. While it retains the basic SD70 designation, the locomotive has several major new features that set it apart from its successful ancestor such as a vibration- isolated powertrain, and alternator start capability. In addition, it features a newly redesigned cab reminiscent of the earlier SD70M, featuring the classic \\"teardrop\\" windshields first introduced on the FP45 in December 1967; new fabricated trucks; a longer frame (76 ft. 8 in / 23.37 m); longer radiators with three radiator fans instead of two; an additional step on the front and rear; and a smoother long hood roofline. Fifteen SD70ACe-T4 demonstrators were built at Muncie, IN by November 2016. Union Pacific Railroad is the first customer to order SD70ACe-T4's. UP 3012-3014, the first production SD70ACe-T4's, were assigned to active service in early November 2016. Union Pacific will acquire 100 SD70ACe-T4's: 12 former demonstrators will be rostered as UP 3000-3011, and 88 production units (3012-3099). 3012-3056 were built at Bombardier's Sahagun, Mexico plant. 3057-3099 will be built at Muncie, IN, following completion of the Tier 4 credit SD70ACe's UP 8997-9096. All UP SD70ACe-T4's are classified as SD70AHT4s. EMDX 1501 will remain in Progress Rail Services ownership as a test bed. SD70ACeP4-T4's EMDX 1603 and 1604 were built and painted as demonstrators for the BNSF Railway. These units have a B1-1B wheel arrangement akin to the SD70ACe-P4. In August 2018, CSX Transportation ordered 10 SD70ACe-T4's, of which all have now been delivered. They are classified by CSX as ST70AH. Norfolk Southern initially ordered 10 SD70ACe-T4's, but later cancelled the order, instead opting for more SD70ACe Tier-4 credit locomotives. The cancelled SD70ACe-T4 locomotives are now part of the Progress Rail lease fleet. =SD70ACe/LCi (2005-Present) = BHP Billiton Iron Ore's 4308 & 4373 at Nelson Point yard, Port Hedland in April 2012 The SD70ACe/LCi is a low clearance, export version of the SD70ACe. The LCi in the model designation stands for Low Clearance international as these locomotives are designed to negotiate the tight clearances under the mine equipment. External differences between the SD70ACe and SD70ACe/LCi models include the addition of marker lights, number boards located lower on the nose rather than on top of the cab, windscreen protector panels (to deflect abrasive iron ore when in mid train position), fire suppression canisters, louvre style vents, different horn and subtle differences with handrails. In 2004, BHP Billiton ordered a first batch of 14 SD70ACe/LCi locomotives for use on iron ore trains in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. It operated in 2015 a fleet of 23 SD70ACe/LCi locomotives beside of 142 standard SD70ACe, from which the newest locomotives are built in 2014. The first member of the class (4300) was purchased for parts and dismantled upon arrival in Australia. This was because it was cheaper to purchase a complete locomotive than buy the components individually. The first batch of SD70ACe/LCi's (4301-4313) was ordered in 2004 and named after sidings on the BHP system.BHP Billiton Loco Roster Pilbara Railways Since it did not have the newer, isolated cab of the second and subsequent batches it was traded in to the supplier for locomotives with newer cab assemblies. The second batch of locomotives (4314-4323) arrived between August and November 2006. An order for a third batch of 13 SD70ACe/LCi's (4334-4346) was placed in August 2007, but such was the demand for locomotive power in the Pilbara region, a deal was done with BNSF Railway for BHP Billiton to purchase ten standard North American SD70ACes (4324-4333) that were in build as their 9166, 9167, 9184-9191. Construction was sufficiently advanced when the deal was concluded for them to have been painted, hence they were delivered in BNSF orange livery. Some modifications have been made to bring them in line with the rest of the fleet. A fifth batch of SD70ACe's (Numbers 4347-4355) was delivered in July 2009. An additional 18 units (numbers 4356-4373) were delivered in the second half of 2010, bringing the total of SD70ACe type locomotives in service to 72. In March 2012, BHP Billiton ordered a further 80. In July 2012 fellow Pilbara operator, Fortescue Metals Group, took the delivery of the first of a fleet of 19, later extended to 21 (701-721).Downer to build 19 locomotives for Fortescue Railway Technology 26 June 2012Fortescue Rail Fact Sheet Fortescue Metals Group May 2013 In 2018, some BHP SD70ACe/LCis were sold to Montana Rail Link. =SD70ACS (2009-Present) = Saudi Railway Company EMDX 3025 (behind 3024, 3023, 3017) heading north through St. Mary's, Ontario in October 2010 The SD70ACS is a AC variant for heavy haul freight, used in desert environments. The first 25 units were ordered for Saudi Railway Company in April 2009 and assembled in the London, Ontario plant for delivery in the second half of 2010. Special features include a pulse filtration system, movable sand plows, EM2000 control system and FIRE display system. Mauritania's Soci√©t√© Nationale Industrielle et Mini√®re placed a contract for six SD70ACS locomotives in October 2010. In July 2011 Etihad Rail ordered seven SD70ACS locomotives for delivery in 2012. Seven locomotives were delivered in 2013. =SD70ACe-BB (2015-present) = In October 2015, EMD started producing SD70ACe-BB locomotives for Brazilian 1000mm gauge railroads. =SD70ACe/45 (2004-present) = An EMD SD70ACe/45 owned by Eldorado Brasil The SD70ACe/45 is a diesel-electric locomotive built by EMD plant in Sete Lagoas, MG Brazil. Different from the SD70ACe in North America, the SD70ACe/45 has a longer frame (76 ft. 6 in.) and three radiator fans on the radiator section since it uses the same car body of the SD80ACe produced by EMD plant in London, Canada to Vale mining in Brazil. It uses gauge. 80 SD70ACe/45s had been built. =SD70IAC (2019-present) = In early 2019 with the delivery of the new SD70ACe-T4C locomotives to Norfolk Southern, a new type of the T4C (Tier 4 Credit) locomotives was rolled out of Progress Rail in Muncie, Indiana. The SD70IAC, SD standing for Special Duty, 70 standing for 70 series, and IAC standing for Individual Axle Control. They are still classified as SD70ACe's on the side of the locomotive but are designated as SD70IAC within the cab controls. The new IAC system improves the existing traction system. =SD70ACe/LW (2007-present) = The SD70ACe/LW is a diesel- electric locomotive built by EMD. Similar to the SD70ACe in North America in the rear, it features a new isolated cab similar to the flat nosed cab of the GT46-ACE GEN II. The SD70ACe/LW has a 16-710G3C-T2 prime-mover with 4,500 horsepower. It uses an AC traction system with a top speed of 74 mph (120 km/h). The SD70ACe/LW is 16 feet and 6 inches tall With 1520 mm gauge. Rebuilds =SD70ACU= NS SD70ACU 7305 The SD70ACU was first built by EMD and later rebuilt by Norfolk Southern. It is originally an SD90MAC (or better known as a SD9043MAC) that has been rebuilt to renew its electrical components and replace the cab with the new EMD Phase-II cab to comply with the most recent safety requirements. These locomotives are similar to the SD70ACe model, but the main body features are all reminiscent to the SD90MAC features. They also have the latest EMD cab that meets current FRA crashworthiness standards. These locomotives also have the Ultra Cab II, locomotive speed limiter (LSL), and cab signals. 100 of the 110 units Norfolk Southern purchased were originally SD9043MACs previously operated by the Union Pacific Railroad. The other 10 units were acquired by a trade with Cit Group for MP15DCs. All NS-owned SD9043MACs are slowly being rebuilt by NS at its shops in Altoona, Pennsylvania. As of May 7, 2019, all 110 SD70ACU units owned by Norfolk Southern have been completed and released to active service. CP SD70ACU 7029 Canadian Pacific has also began a program to convert their SD90MAC units into SD70ACUs, but unlike Norfolk Southern, Progress Rail is performing the rebuilds. The first of these have since been released. The initial order was for 30 units and then increased to 60. Canadian Pacific originally rostered 61 SD90MACs, These units spent much of the 2010-decade parked in long term storage, with the exception of three, which were retired and scrapped in 2012. The remaining 58, along with two surplus Union Pacific SD90MACs, will be used as cores for the 60 SD70ACUs. 10 have been painted in the classic CP tuscan and grey paint scheme, and 5 as special armed forces units. The remainder will receive the standard CP red paint scheme. =SD70ACC= The SD70ACC is the latest rebuild in Norfolk's Southern's DC to AC program. It has the new EMD safety cab, similar to the SD70ACe cab, but with the ‚Äúteardrop windshield‚Äù, much like the SD70ACe-T4. The SD70ACC has been rebuilt with AC traction motors, an AAR-style control stand, an electrical cabinet with Mitsubishi electronics, a new main alternator, and additional weight to increase the maximum weight to 432,000 pounds. The SD70ACC is rated at 4,500 horsepower (3,355.649 kilowatts), has a fuel capacity of 4,900 gallons, and has dynamic braking, cab signals, and LSL (Locomotive Speed Limiter). Norfolk Southern is rebuilding its fleet of SD70s into SD70ACC specifications.https://m.facebook.com/nsdash9/posts/10155476809143843https://m.facebook.com/nsdash9/posts/10155326954688843 The first two units, 1800 and 1801, were unveiled in a special yellow and grey paint scheme to promote the DC to AC program, similar to the paint schemes used on the first GE AC44C6M. As of January 2020, 52 units have been rebuilt and have since been released to service, with many more units undergoing rebuild.http://www.nsdash9.com/rosters/1800.html =SD70MACe= The SD70MACe is a rebuilt SD70MAC locomotive with Electronics, first rebuilt by the BNSF Railway, and later rebuilt by CSX and KCS. =SD70MACH= The SD70MACH is a SD70MAC rebuilt by Progress Rail for Metra.

Its significant advantage over pneumatic tires is that the Tweel does not use a bladder full of compressed air, and therefore cannot burst, leak pressure, or become flat. Instead, the Tweel's hub is connected to the rim via flexible polyurethane spokes which fulfil the shock-absorbing role provided by the compressed air in a traditional tire. Design The Tweel consists of a band of conventional tire rubber with molded tread, a shear beam just below the tread that creates a compliant contact patch, a series of energy-absorbing polyurethane spokes, and an integral inner hub structure. Both the shear beam and the polyurethane spokes can be designed to provide a calibrated directional stiffness in order to control both how the Tweel handles and how it handles loads. The inner hub structure may be either rigid or compliant, depending on the application requirements, and as such may contain a matrix of deformable plastic structures that flex under load and subsequently return to their original shape. By varying the thickness and size of the spokes the design elements can be manipulated to engineer a wide range of ride and handling qualities. The tread can be as specialized as any conventional tires and is replaceable. Benefits and drawbacks Potential benefits of the Tweel include not only the obvious safety and convenience of never having flat tires, but also, in automotive applications, the Tweel airless tire has the potential to be able to brake better ‚Äì a significant performance compromise that is inherent to pneumatic tires. Unlike a pneumatic tire, a Tweel can be designed to have high lateral stiffness while simultaneously having low vertical stiffness. This can be achieved because, in the design elements of a Tweel, the vertical and lateral stiffness are not inseparably linked and can thus be optimized independently. Because there is no air bladder under the tread, tread patterns can, if desired, even incorporate water evacuation through holes in the design thus eliminating or significantly reducing hydroplaning. Michelin expects the tread to last two to three times as long as a conventional tire. Because the tread rubber around the outer circumference is replaceable when worn (as opposed to disposing of a whole worn tire), the potential environmental impact of a Tweel airless tire can be less than that of a conventional pneumatic tire. Tweel is useful for: \\"vehicles that don't have suspensions like lawn mowers ‚Äì those low speed specialty vehicles that don't have suspensions. The comfort is quite good and better than inflated tyres\\" said Terry K. Gettys, Executive Vice-President, Research and Development, and member of the Group Executive Committee at French tire company Michelin. Military testing has indicated that the Tweel deflects mine blasts away from the vehicle better than standard tires and that the Tweel remains mobile even with several spokes damaged or missing. Although it is acknowledged that the initial prototype automotive Tweel tires did demonstrate flaws with regard to noise and high speed vibration and produced 5 percent more friction compared to a radial tire, these early issues were resolved in subsequent prototypes, and current automotive Tweel prototype products have been shown to be well behaved and reliable. As a demonstration of Tweel viability and reliability, three highway driven vehicles (a 2012 Honda CR-Z, a resto-modded 1955 Morris Minor Traveller, and an Aluma brand trailer hauling a Polaris ATV which was also equipped with Tweel tires) successfully participated in the entire 2013 Hot Rod Power Tour long distance road trip event in June 2013.  Applications  The LRI AB Scarab Tweel The iBOT mobility device and Segway's Concept Centaur were both introduced with Tweel airless tires. Michelin also has additional projects for the Tweel concept on small construction equipment, such as skid-steer loaders, for which it seems well-suited. NASA has contracted Michelin to develop a wheel for the next generation lunar rover based on the Tweel concept. This has resulted in the Lunar Rover Initiative AB Scarab wheels. In October 2012, Michelin North America Inc. began commercial sales of the Michelin 12N16.5 X Tweel for skid- steer loaders used in landscaping, construction, contracting, refuse/recycling and agricultural industries. Awards On 8 November 2005, Popular Science magazine named Michelin's Tweel as the \\"Best of What's New\\" honor in the Automotive Technology category. The next day, Michelin NA was awarded a Hall of Fame Award by InnoVision for continued leadership in innovation as evidenced by the development of the Tweel. TIME Magazine named the Tweel as \\"One of the Most Amazing Inventions of 2005\\" a few short days later on 14 November 2005. The Intermat innovation commission in Paris (the International Exhibition of Equipment, Machinery and Techniques for the Construction and Building Materials Industry) awarded the Tweel with a 2006 Gold Medal for Innovation. This prize reinforced Michelin's technological leadership and rewarded Michelin‚Äôs contribution to improvements in productivity and safety for the construction industry. The jury of Intermat 2006 was made up of recognized European experts and professionals and required to rank the innovations according to five criteria: * Technical design and technologies: improvement in productivity, ease of maintenance; * Economy: lower purchase price and maintenance costs; * Quality of work carried out; * Ease of use, ergonomics, comfort, safety and improvement in working conditions; * Environmental friendliness. A Silver Award in the Transportation category was awarded to the Tweel SSL on 26 April 2013 by the 2013 Edison Awards. Of the 7,156 applications received, 131 finalists were selected by the Edison Awards Committee. The Tweel SSL was one of 42 winners, who represented 12 categories and symbolize the persistence and excellence personified by Thomas Alva Edison. The Tweel SSL was selected as one of the 2013 Contractors‚Äô Top 50 New Products by readers of Equipment Today as one of the industry‚Äôs most innovative products for the year. In January 2014, Equipment World named one of the ‚Äúfive game-changing‚Äù construction products of 2013 for their 2014 Innovations Awards. The Tweel SSL was named as one of those five product winners.

The series was produced by Holmes Associates for LWT for ITV and had a budget of 5 million pounds. Synopsis The series is based on the 1983 novel Piece of Cake, by Derek Robinson. In the book, the squadron is equipped with Hurricanes. The relative rarity of airworthy Hurricanes in the late 1980s precluded their use in the television series. The squadron depicted is the fictional Hornet Squadron, which is equipped with Supermarine Spitfire fighters, and deployed to France, where it waits out the Phoney War in comfort and elegance, until the German attack on Western Europe in May 1940. One by one, nearly all of the original pilots are killed and as losses mount, the character of the squadron changes from a casual nonchalance to a fight for survival. By the end of the series, only four of the original fourteen officers have survived. Some of the major themes explored in the script include: the snobbery and class-consciousness that existed in the RAF during the era; the belief cherished by many of the pilots that the war would be fought as a sporting gentleman's contest; the inflexibility and ineffectiveness of the tactics used by RAF Fighter Command in early 1940 and the poor gunnery skills and inadequate training of many of the British pilots in the early days of World War II. Like Robinson's original novel, the story spans the first year of the war, from September 1939 to the German Luftwaffe's first massed aerial assault on London on 7 September 1940.

When the series was screened on Network Seven in Australia in 1990, the original run-time of over 5 hours was shortened to less than 4 hrs so it could be shown in two 2hr episodes (plus commercials). In order to condense the series, a considerable amount of footage was cut, mostly from scenes on the ground including some entire scenes such as when Chris Hart invites one of the ground-crew LAC Todd to play squash and the press conference held on Hornet Squadron's airfield in France. Production Six mock-up Spitfires were built as static or ground-running props. Most were destroyed during the air-raid sequences later in filming. Original plans called for six Spitfires to be used in the UK filming of the series (a Mk.1a, a Mk.VIIIc, three Mk.IXs and a PR.Mk.XI), but the owner of the Mk.VIIIc could not participate after a family member was severely injured in an unrelated air accident and filming commenced with five Spitfires painted in a generic period-correct scheme. A sixth Spitfire was flown in the USA for the bomber shoot-down scenes with a Heinkel 111. Veteran display pilot Ray Hanna (1928-2005) performed the scene where a Spitfire flies under a bridge in France. The scene itself was filmed by the stone bridge at Winston near Barnard Castle and Hanna, a New Zealand-born former RAF fighter pilot and Red Arrows leader, flew his own Spitfire LF.Mk.IX \\"MH434/G-ASJV\\" for the sequence. Hanna's son Mark also flew in the production.See extensive discussion of production details in Philip Kaplan, \\"The Spitfire: An Icon of the Skies,\\" Pen and Sword Aviation (July 31, 2017) The series used footage from the 1969 motion picture Battle of Britain for many of the dogfight scenes. Air-to-air filming of the aerial sequences was done with a vintage B-25 Mitchell bomber, Harvard trainer and an Agusta 109 helicopter, all of which served as camera ships for the shoot. The production made use of three vintage Messerschmitt Bf 109s which were actually Hispano Ha 1112 Buchons, a Merlin-powered version of the Bf 109 that was used by the Spanish Air-Force up until the late 1960s. These same aircraft later also appeared in the motion-picture Memphis Belle in 1990. To portray Luftwaffe bombers in the series, two Heinkel He 111 (also Spanish-built versions) were used. An airworthy example was filmed in an aerial battle with a Spitfire (both operated by the Confederate Air Force) in Texas, USA and in the UK a partially dismantled aircraft was used for the filming of the scene where Hornet Squadron visits the crash site of their very first 'kill' in France. The 'crashed' Heinkel, registered G-AWHB, was flown to the UK from Spain in 1968 to be used in the filming of the movie Battle of Britain and later appeared in the film Patton. For the scene where Cattermole and Steele-Stebbing destroy a German rescue aircraft, a vintage Junkers Ju 52 (Spanish-built CASA-353L) was used. Scenes at the 'Chateau St. Pierre' were filmed at Charlton Park, Wiltshire, where the Earl of Suffolk has a private airstrip. The airfield used to represent 'RAF Bodkin Hazel' was the long- disused RAF Friston sited on the East Sussex coast alongside the imposing Seven Sisters cliffs. Some of the exterior filming for the first episode of the series (at Hornet Squadron's original base, \\"RAF Kingsmere\\") was completed at South Cerney airfield in Gloucestershire UK which, in 1988, still featured several period hangars and a pre-war control tower. For the French airfield scenes at \\"Le Touquet\\", the producers filmed at Cambridge Airport. In an interview in 2010, Derek Robinson, author of the original novel Piece of Cake remarked that when the novel was first published in 1983, the first edition sold poorly in the UK, although it did well in the US. He credits the 1988 LWT production with greatly reviving interest in the novel.

December 23, 1927) was an American woman who died flying to Newfoundland just prior to her attempt to cross the Atlantic Ocean. She was a niece of President Woodrow Wilson.Jackson, Joe, Atlantic Fever: Lindbergh, His Competitors, and the Race to Cross the Atlantic, New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2012, , p. 414. Biography Grayson was born as Frances Wilson in Cherokee Village, Arkansas, to Andrew Jackson \\"A.J.\\" Wilson and Minnie M. Lewis. She had two brothers: Walter M. Wilson later became a grocer in Muncie, Indiana. The other, Roscoe Jesse \\"Jack\\" Wilson died young (prior to 1924). In 1896, the family moved from Arkansas to Indiana, where she graduated from Muncie High School in Muncie. She next attended the Chicago Musical College in Chicago, Illinois. Her plan was to accompany her brother \\"Jack\\", who planned to be a professional singer. When her brother died she stopped studying music. She then attended Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, for recitation and dramatic arts. At Swarthmore College, she met John Brady Grayson, and they married on September 15, 1914. They divorced with no children after nine years. Frances Grayson then moved to Manhattan, New York City, where she was a writer for a newspaper. She then became a real estate agent. While in Manhattan, Grayson became interested in aviation and in the idea of making a flight across the Atlantic Ocean. She bought a new Sikorsky S-36 amphibian plane, which she named Dawn, and received financing for the flight from Mrs. Aage Ancker. She recruited Royal Norwegian Navy Lieutenant Oskar Omdal to serve as the aircraft's pilot, Brice Goldsborough as its navigator, and Frank Koehler as its radio engineer. They made plans to begin the transatlantic flight from the Dominion of Newfoundland. Omdal was to fly the plane across the Atlantic, although Grayson may have planned to perform some of the flying herself. The four took off from Curtiss Field on Long Island, New York, on the evening of December 23, 1927, bound for Harbor Grace in Newfoundland. They radioed that something was wrong later in the evening and never reached Newfoundland; their remains were never found. Their plane probably went down in the Atlantic off Nova Scotia during a storm. Grayson was 35 years old at the time of her death. Legacy In 1928, the Ontario Surveyor General named a number of lakes in the northwest of the province to honour aviators who had perished during 1927, mainly in attempting oceanic flights. p 14.

He fought with distinction in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, earning two brevet promotions for his performance in the conflict. After resigning and surveying for the Mexican Government, he returned to the U.S. Army to fight in the American Civil War. Stone was reportedly the first volunteer to enter the Union Army, and during the war he served as a general officer, noted for his involvement at the Battle of Ball's Bluff in October 1861. Held responsible for the Union defeat, Stone was arrested and imprisoned for almost six months, mostly for political reasons. He never received a trial, and after his release he would not hold a significant command during the war again. Stone later served again with distinction as a general in the Egyptian Army, and is also noted for his role in constructing the base of the Statue of Liberty. Early life Stone was born in Greenfield, Massachusetts, a son of Alpheus Fletcher Stone, the town's doctor, and his wife Fanny Cushing.Heidler, p. 1867. He was one of ten children in a Protestant family of Puritan descent. In 1841 he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point and graduated four years later, standing seventh out of 41 cadets. His time at the academy was shared with a number of other recruits who would go on to have important roles in the Civil War and the lead-up to it, including such ardent secessionists as William Logan Crittenden. He was appointed a brevet second lieutenant of ordnance on July 1, 1845.Eicher, Civil War High Commands, p. 513. He and his younger sister, Fanny Cushing Parker (1827‚Äì1898), were Roman Catholic converts. Military career, marriage and civilian career =Ordnance officer= Stone stayed at West Point, serving as an assistant professor and teaching geography, history, and also ethics from August 28, 1845, to January 13, 1846. Afterwards he was posted to the Watervliet Arsenal in New York as Assistant Ordnance Officer, and then to Fortress Monroe at Old Point Comfort, Virginia, both in 1846. While there Stone worked in the facilities arsenal and was an assistant to Capt. Benjamin Huger, whom he would serve under in the war with Mexico. =Mexican war= Fighting with Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott's army in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War,Warner, p. 480. Stone was promoted to second lieutenant on March 3, 1847. He first saw action during the Siege of Veracruz from March 9-29, then the skirmishing near Amazoque on May 14, and the Battle of Contreras on August 19-20\\\\. Stone then fought notably during the Battle of Molino del Rey on September 8, and was appointed a brevet first lieutenant from that date for \\"gallant and meritorious conduct\\" in this fight. Mexico's Popocat√©petl volcano in 2009; Stone climbed its summit in 1848. On September 13, 1847, Stone participated in the Battle of Chapultepec, and was appointed a brevet captain for his conduct on that day. He then fought in the Battle for Mexico City until September 15, and was part of a successful climbing party of the volcano at Popocatepetl, raising an American Flag at its summit. He was an original member of the Aztec Club of 1847, a military society formed by U.S. Army officers who had served in Mexico. =Pacific coast= After the war with Mexico ended, Stone returned to the Watervliet Arsenal in 1848, again taking up his position as Assistant Ordnance Officer. He then was granted a leave of absence from the U.S. Army, and proceeded to Europe to study military practices of the armies there for two years. In 1850 he resumed duty at the Watervliet Arsenal briefly, and then was given command of the Ft. Monroe Arsenal into 1851. Later that year Stone was appointed Chief of Ordnance for the Pacific Department, a post he held until 1855, and also began construction of the Benicia Arsenal in California that year. During this time he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant, effective February 26, 1853.Eicher, p. 513; Aztec Club site biography of Stone =Marriage= In 1853 Stone married Maria Louisa Clary, daughter of Esther Philipson and Lt. Robert Emmett Clary, a West Point classmate of Jefferson Davis; Davis served as best man at Esther's wedding on March 31, 1829.Ehrlich, p. 28. =Post-military career= On November 17, 1856, he resigned his commission in the U.S. Army, \\"finding the pay inadequate\\" for his family. He briefly became a banker in 1856 in San Francisco, but the bank failed the following year due to the \\"...absconding of its treasurer.\\" Stone then went back to Mexico, where he worked in various government jobs. From 1857 to 1860 he surveyed the Mexican state of Sonora, and from 1858 to 1860 he surveyed the lower region of California. Also from 1858 to 1859 Stone served as acting consul at Guaymas, Mexico, the municipal center of Sonora . In 1860 he moved his family back to the U.S., settling in Washington, D.C. In 1861 he published his survey findings, entitled Notes on the State of Sonora. =Civil War= At the outbreak of secession, Stone found himself in Washington writing his report on Sonora. After a dinner with his former commander Winfield Scott, Stone was requested to be Inspector General of the District of Columbia Militia at the rank of colonel as of January 1, 1861, and was thus reputed to be the first volunteer officer mustered into the Union Army before the Civil War. In this role, he secured the capital for the arrival of President-elect Abraham Lincoln, and was personally responsible for security at the new president's inaugural.Catton, Mr. Lincoln's Army, p. 70. One of his most important acts in this role was to frustrate an attempt by southern militias and the secret society known as the Knights of the Golden Circle to carry out a coup against the nascent Lincoln administration. Stone received word that militia groups from Baltimore and surrounding areas intended to infiltrate Washington, D.C. and seize the city by force during Lincoln's inauguration. First Stone forced one suspected militia commander to give an oath of loyalty to the United States or be stripped of all rank, upon which that commander resigned. A second commander was maneuvered into handing Stone a full roster of all the men in his militia, then denied access to weapons and thoroughly investigated. Stone's prompt action disintegrated the plot against the inaugural.Keehn, David C. Knights of the Golden Circle: Secret Empire, Southern Secession, Civil War. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2013. . Stone was appointed Colonel of the 14th U.S. Infantry Regiment on May 14, and then a brigadier general in the Union Army that August, to rank from May 17. He commanded a brigade in Maj. Gen. Robert Patterson's Army of the Shenandoah during the First Bull Run campaign in June and July. Stone then was given command of a division, called the Corps of Observation, guarding the fords along the upper Potomac River that fall. In his efforts to carry out his orders and maintain discipline, Stone drew the attention and wrath of his home state's governor, John A. Andrew, and Charles Sumner, the senior U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, both powerful and influential Radical Republican politicians. In late September Stone issued general orders that required his men \\"not to incite and encourage insubordination among the coloured servants in the neighbourhood.\\" When two runaway slaves came into their lines, one of his regiments, the 20th Massachusetts Infantry, promptly caught them and returned them to their owner. This was done in compliance with Stone's orders as well as both Federal and Maryland law. However, many of the 20th Massachusetts were abolitionists, disagreed with Stone's insistence on returning runaways back into slavery, and wrote both their families and their representatives about the incident. Governor Andrew strongly reprimanded the colonel of the regiment, who gave the letter to Stone.Catton, Mr. Lincoln's Army, pp. 70‚Äì71. After reading it Stone wrote back, its contents summarized by military historian Bruce Catton as follows: \\"this regiment was in United States service now and the governor had no business meddling with discipline, the young lieutenant and the colonel had properly done what they were told to do and were not subject to reprimand from any governor, and would the governor in future please keep his hand off?\\" More heated letters passed between Andrew and Stone, and then Andrew involved Sumner, who quickly and strongly denounced Stone to the U.S. Senate. Stone's written response to this--described as \\"in terms so bitter that it almost seemed as if he were challenging the senator to duel\\"Garrison, p. 118; Catton, pp. 79‚Äì80.--further inflamed the situation. Stone's dealings with these two men would have tragic consequences in his near future. Ball's Bluff On October 20, 1861, Stone was ordered by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan to conduct a reconnaissance across the Potomac River to report on Confederate activities in Leesburg, Virginia. McClellan also hoped this action, combined with a movement by Brig. Gen. George A. McCall's division of 13,000 men toward Dranesville the day before, would encourage a Confederate withdrawal from the area without an engagement occurring.Garrison, p. 110. This message from McClellan's staff related the situation and outlined Stone's orders: alt=black and white full body image of General Stone in this Union Army uniform with cape From this order Stone reasonably believed he had support nearby from McCall if needed; what he did not know was that McClellan had ordered McCall back to his previous position at Langley on October 21, putting any help for Stone further away. Stone's division numbered about 10,000 men and was posted around Poolesville, Maryland, about eight miles from Leesburg, with portions of his command at points along the Potomac shore. He moved his artillery to Edward's Ferry along the Potomac, from which he could shell the woods on the opposite side of the river, held by Confederate forces. Stone then sent three small boats with about 100 men from the 1st Minnesota Infantry across, who returned shortly without incident. Near sunset he sent out a small patrol of 20 soldiers of the 15th Massachusetts Infantry to scout toward Leesburg and see whether the Union movements had the desired effect or not. Crossing at Harrison's Island on the river, these men scaled Ball's Bluff and encountered what they believed was a Confederate camp of at least thirty men less than a mile inland. The patrol returned to Harrison's Island around 10 p.m. and reported by messenger to Stone at Edwards Ferry.Garrison, pp. 110‚Äì1; Winkler, p. 41. In response to this report, Stone thought the Confederate forces were indeed leaving Leesburg and decided to investigate further. While he led part of his command directly across at Edwards Ferry at 5 p.m., Stone ordered Col. Charles Devens and 300 men of his 15th Massachusetts to immediately cross over to Ball's Bluff that night. Stone's instructions were to \\"March silently under cover of night to the position of the camp [and] attack and destroy it at daybreak... and return rapidly to the island.\\"Winkler, pp. 41‚Äì43; Garrison, pp. 111‚Äì12. Devens carried out Stone's orders and made the difficult crossing on three small 10-man boats, taking him four hours to accomplish. Stone also gave Devens discretion over what to do after the attack; either hold Leesburg or return to Harrison's Island. Stone ordered the rest of the 15th Massachusetts over and added the 20th Massachusetts Infantry, under Col. William R. Lee, to this effort as well, and ordered Colonel and U.S. Senator Edward D. Baker to take overall command. Devens found no camp since an earlier patrol apparently confused corn shocks as tents in the evening shadows; he halted and asked Stone for instructions, who responded to push closer to Leesburg. Devens determined to hold there, waiting several hours for reinforcements, when skirmishing began at 7 a.m., before Baker had arrived. Confederate Col. Nathan G. \\"Shanks\\" Evans was in charge of the forces opposing Stone, and when he learned of the crossings he split his 2,000-man command. Three of his regiments were ordered to deal with Stone by blocking the road from Edwards Ferry to Leesburg, while the remainder fought and defeated Baker's force at Ball's Bluff. Since Baker sent no updates, Stone had no idea a battle was occurring there and finding his path blocked by Confederates Stone returned to Edwards Ferry. He then moved toward Harrison's Island, learned of the defeat at Ball's Bluff, and quickly asked McClellan for help from McCall, whom he thought nearby but was actually more than twenty miles away.Garrison, pp. 112‚Äì16; Winkler, pp. 43‚Äì46. alt=Black and white image of Stone as a general in his Union Army uniform Stone lost about 1,000 men who were either killed, wounded, captured, or drowned during Ball's Bluff, while the Confederates lost less than 160. The Union total included Baker, the only sitting U.S. Senator killed in combat when \\"four bullets ripped into him, and he was dead before he hit the ground\\".Eicher, Longest Night, pp. 125‚Äì28 Baker's death and the action at Ball's Bluff would have serious consequences for Stone, and also affect the way the American Civil War would be prosecuted.Eicher, Longest Night, pp. 125‚Äì28; Winkler, pp. 44‚Äì46; Garrison, pp. 114‚Äì16. In his official report about the battle on October 24, McClellan did not hold Stone personally responsible for the defeat, saying \\"The disaster was caused by errors committed by the immediate Commander-- not General Stone.\\"Garrison, p. 46. Arrest and imprisonment Stone bore the brunt of much public criticism; the U.S. Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War was established in the wake of Baker's congressional eulogies and anger over the defeat. This seven-man group called Stone as one of their first witnesses about the Ball's Bluff affair, and all testimony given by him and 38 others was kept secret. Before the end of October 1861, Stone's official report about Ball's Bluff had been leaked to the New York Tribune newspaper, and in it Stone praised Baker's bravery but made clear his shortcomings as a field commander. Baker's congressional allies, among them Governor Andrew and Senator Sumner, openly denounced this report and began to point accusing fingers at Stone, not at Baker. Stone's loyalty to the Union and position on slavery were more in question than his military abilities and decisions. The committee's questions accused him of improper and frequent communications with the Confederates, of not re-enforcing Baker, of using his men to protect slaveholder property in Maryland, and of returning runaway slaves to their owners--despite the last two of these following Maryland as well as Federal law.Winkler, pp. 47‚Äì51 Another problem for Stone defending himself was an order from McClellan forbidding him to give testimony \\"regarding his [McClellan's] plans, his orders for the movement of troops, or his orders concerning the position of troops.\\"Garrison, pp. 118‚Äì20. This made it impossible for Stone to explain his movements to the committee, but kept McClellan out of the investigation as well.Winkler, pp. 47‚Äì51; Garrison, pp. 118‚Äì20. Under a cloud for suspected disloyalty and treason, Stone was arrested just after midnight on February 8, 1862, on orders of Maj. Gen. McClellan, who was acting under orders from Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, dated January 28. Awaiting Stone near his home in Washington were 18 soldiers led by Brig. Gen. George Sykes. When Stone approached, Sykes stated \\"I have now the most disagreeable duty to perform that I ever had--it is to arrest you.\\"Winkler, p. 53. When Stone angrily asked why, Sykes said \\"I don't know. It's by order of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, general-in-chief of the army... I may as well tell you that you are to be sent to Fort Lafayette.\\" This shocked Stone, who stated \\"That's where they send secessionists! I have been as true a soldier to the Government as any in service.\\" Under guard, Stone was ordered to be sent to the military prison at Fort Lafayette by train. When he reached the rail depot at Philadelphia, confusion as to payment for his ticket caused Stone to buy his own ticket. Upon reaching the facility he was put immediately into solitary confinement, but he managed to hire an attorney and waited for official charges to be filed. According to the Articles of War this had to be done within eight days of an arrest, but was never done in Stone's case. He sent several inquiries to McClellan, to the army's adjutant general's office, and to Stanton himself, who stated \\" ...the charges were being reviewed prior to being publicized...\\", but received no satisfactory explanation.Garrison, pp. 120‚Äì21. Contrary to U.S. Army regulations as well, no charges were ever filed against Stone nor did he stand trial. While he was in solitary confinement at Fort Lafayette, he could not exercise, and consequently Stone's health began to degrade. His physicians protested heavily to Stanton, who ordered him transferred to the military prison at Fort Hamilton. There Stone was allowed to exercise and his condition improved. He stayed at Fort Lafayette for fifty days, and would spend another 139 in Fort Hamilton.Winkler, p. 54. Stone was finally released without explanation or apology on August 16, 1862. The reason for his release was new legislation written by California Senator James A. McDougall. In a small addition to another bill, McDougall reiterated the Articles of War requirement that official charges be filed within eight days of arrest, but went on to include that any imprisoned officer must be given their trial within thirty days. McDougall also made it clear this legislation applied to those currently under arrest, which covered Stone's case. It passed the U.S. Congress and was signed into law by President Lincoln on July 17, 1862. Stanton then waited the thirty days before releasing Stone.Garrison, pp. 122‚Äì23; Eicher, Civil War High Commands, p. 513. It may, or may not be that President Lincoln ordered the arrest of Stone. In a communication of September 30, 1862, General in Chief H. W. Halleck wrote about Stone's arrest: ‚ÄúI understood that it was made by the orders of the President.‚Äùp. 344, The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series 1, Volume 5, 1881, September 30, 1862, H W. Halleck to Charles P. Stone. Release and reassignment After his release, Stone returned home to Washington and awaited orders, and also continued to try to clear his name. Despite the arrest and confinement, Stone's services were still in demand. In September 1862, as the Maryland Campaign developed, McClellan asked the War Department to re-instate Stone, but Stanton declined. When Maj. Gen Joseph Hooker took over command of the Army of the Potomac in early 1863, he asked for Stone as his chief of staff, but Stanton denied this request as well. On February 27, Stone was finally allowed to hear the testimony that caused him to be arrested, and with McClellan no longer his commander Stone could freely answer the accusations. He did this to the Committee's satisfaction, who soon afterwards published its revised findings, clearing Stone.Catton, Glory Road, pp. 147‚Äì48; Winkler, pp. 54‚Äì55; Garrison, p. 123. With the facts now known, The New York Times newspaper editorialized: Without assignment until May, Stone was ordered to the Department of the Gulf, serving as a member of the surrender commission at Port Hudson and in the Red River Campaign as Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks's chief of staff. However, on April 4, 1864, Stanton ordered Stone mustered out of his volunteer commission as a brigadier general and he reverted to his rank of colonel within the regular army. He served briefly as a brigade commander in the Army of the Potomac during the Siege of Petersburg, but finally resigned from the Army on September 13, 1864, before the end of the war. Later life alt=Black and white image of Stone with a beard in his Egyptian Army uniform After the American Civil War ended in 1865, Stone worked as an engineer and later superintendent for Virginia's Dover Mining Company until 1869.Heidler, p. 1867; Eicher, Civil War High Commands, p. 514. The following year William T. Sherman, by now the U.S. Army's Commanding General, recommended Stone for service in the Egyptian Army. From 1870 to 1883 he served as chief of staff and general aide-de-camp for the khedive Isma'il Pasha of Egypt. While there he was given the rank of ferik, equal to a lieutenant general, and the title of Ferik Pasha.Eicher, Civil War High Commands, p. 514. Stone's career in the Egyptian Army has been described thus: alt=Color picture of the Statue of liberty and ellis island. The statue is in green Stone later returned to the United States, where he worked as an engineer for the Florida Ship Canal Company in 1883. In 1884, he accepted the position of Chief Engineer of the Statue of Liberty project at Bedloe's Island, New York Harbor, and planned and supervised the construction of the Statue of Liberty's pedestal, concrete foundation and the reassembly of the Statue of Liberty after its arrival from France. Stone served as the grand marshal of the dedication parade in Manhattan on October 28, 1886. He fell ill some months afterwards and died in New York City. General Stone is buried in West Point National Cemetery. Stone's first wife Maria died in Washington, D.C., shortly after Stone's release from Fort Hamilton. While serving in New Orleans during 1863, Stone fell in love with Jeanne Stone and they had two daughters and a son, John Stone Stone, who later became a pioneer in the field of wireless telegraphy. Stone was also an original founding member of the Aztec Club of 1847, a social organization for officers who served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Legacy Military historian Ezra J.

It is a portfolio agency of the Western Australia Department of Culture and the Arts, and controlled by the Library Board of Western Australia. The State Library has particular responsibility for collecting and preserving Western Australia's documentary heritage. The J. S. Battye Library of West Australian History is the section of the library dedicated to West Australiana.  History  In 1886, the Western Australian Legislative Council allocated ¬£5000 to be spent in celebrations for Queen Victoria's golden jubilee. Of this, it was decided that ¬£3000 would be used to establish a free public library in Perth. A foundation stone was laid at a site in St Georges Terrace in 1887, however due to the lack of funds this site was not built upon. Instead, books to the value of ¬£1000 were ordered from England, and the library found temporary accommodation in a building opposite the site. The Victoria Public Library, named in honour of Queen Victoria, opened on 26 January 1889. The first managers of the library were the clerks to the management committee, W.C. Townsend and then Basil Porter. The first Chief Librarian, James Sykes Battye, was appointed in 1894. By 1896, construction had begun on a site at the corner of James and Beaufort Streets, and in 1897 the library moved to the new James Street site. In 1904, the word 'Victoria' was removed from the name of the library, which then became known as the Public Library of Western Australia. A new addition to the site was opened in 1913. It was called Hackett Hall after Sir John Winthrop Hackett, the President of the Trustees of the Library, Museum and Art Gallery. The library shared this building with the Art Gallery and Museum, and the Western Australian Museum still occupies the building today. The Library Board of Western Australia was established with the passing of the Library Board of Western Australia Act 1951, appointing the first State Librarian, F. A. (Ali) Sharr. The purpose of the Board was to assist local authorities in establishing free public libraries throughout the state, and work to co- ordinating those libraries as a statewide system. However, James Battye successfully resisted having the Board take over control of the Public Library of Western Australia. It was only after Battye died in office in 1954 that the Library Board gained control of the library. It was closed for a year for renovations, then reopened in 1956 as the State Library of Western Australia. This included a section dedicated to collecting Western Australian material ‚Äì the J.S. Battye Library of West Australian History and State Archives. Between 1964 and 2002 the organisation was known as the Library and Information Service of Western Australia. This reflected the Library Board's broader operations beyond the walls of the library, particularly in encouraging the development of public library services throughout the state. In July 2002, the library once again became known as the State Library of Western Australia. By the late 1970s, the library had grown sufficiently that staff were working from ten different sites and annexes in the city. Planning was undertaken for a new building as part of the development of the Perth Cultural Centre. In 1985 the library's current home, the Alexander Library Building, was opened. It is named after Professor Fred Alexander, the first chairman of the Library Board of Western Australia. The State Archives (later called the Public Records Office) was established as a separate unit in 1988, and the State Records Office of Western Australia was created as a separate entity to the library in 2000 with the passing of the State Records Act 2000. Responsibility for the collection and management of public records was transferred to SRO, although it remains co-located with the State Library in the Alexander Library Building.  Collections and services  The State Library's operations fall into three main areas ‚Äì collecting and preserving Western Australia's documentary heritage, general reference and public lending library services, and supporting the public library network in Western Australia. = Western Australian heritage = The J. S. Battye Library of Western Australian History is the arm of the library dedicated to Western Australian materials. The Battye Library contains a comprehensive collection of books published in Western Australia, as well as books by a Western Australian or about Western Australia published elsewhere. It also contains a comprehensive coverage of West Australian newspapers, and a more selective coverage of serials and maps published in Western Australia. The library also has extensive collections of: * Original manuscripts, journals, diaries and letters of individuals, and records of non-government organisations * Western Australian music recordings * Photographs * Western Australian films * Oral history recordings and transcripts The State Library was the legal deposit library for Western Australia under the Copyright Act 1895 and the Newspaper Libel and Registration Act 1884, but these Acts were repealed in 1994 and 2005 respectively. Legal deposit provisions were re-established in principle in 2012, with the passing of the Legal Deposit Act 2012, and brought into force for physical publications with the passage of the Legal Deposit Regulations 2013. = Reference and lending library = The library's reference collection provides resources which \\"reflect key Australian reference publications; and cover all subject areas to support self-directed learning to an undergraduate level\\". The collection holds over 300,000 books and nearly 5,000 serial titles, and many items are available for loan. The library also provides a number of electronic resources, some of which are available off-site for library members. There are also approximately 100 public computers available to users, as well as free Wi-Fi. Other specialised collections and services include: * Sheet music ‚Äì the library holds over 50,000 music scores, making it possibly one of the largest public music lending libraries in Australia * Genealogy resources ‚Äì the library has a specialist family history section, and volunteers from the Western Australian Genealogical Society provide assistance to clients * The Place ‚Äì a dedicated children's area = Relationship with public libraries = Public library services in Western Australia are delivered as a partnership between the State and Local Governments. The State Government provides funding for the majority of the book stock and some other library materials, and local governments provide physical and technological infrastructure and staffing to operate public libraries. This partnership is administered by the Library Board of Western Australia through the State Library. The library provides centralised purchasing, and a statewide online catalogue, as well as facilitating the exchange of materials between public libraries. =National edeposit (NED)= As a member library of National and State Libraries Australia, the organisation collaborated on the creation of the National edeposit (NED) system, which enables publishers from all over Australia to upload electronic publications as per the 2016 amendment to the Copyright Act 1968 and other regional legislation relating to legal deposit, and makes these publications publicly accessible online (depending on access conditions) from anywhere via Trove.

The Ouija board, telegraphing its eerie messages in capital letters, conveys poetry through automatic writing.

Hornet Squadron first appeared in Robinson's 1983 novel Piece of Cake, which spans the period from the start of the Second World War through the Battle of Britain. In 1988 Piece of Cake became a 6-part television mini- series. In the book the squadron flies the Hawker Hurricane while in the television series, the Supermarine Spitfire is flown. The next Hornet Squadron book was War Story (1987) set in 1916 during the First World War. It was followed by Hornet's Sting (1991) set in 1917. These Hornet Squadron novels became prequels to Robinson's first book, Goshawk Squadron (1971) which was set in 1918. Despite the different squadron names, there are common characters linking the books. The World War I books sees the squadron operating F.E.2 fighters.

Originating in 1968 and active until 1973, the organization was designed to support young, white migrants from the Appalachia region who experienced extreme poverty and discrimination. Along with the Illinois Black Panther Party and the Young Lords, the Young Patriots Organization formed the Rainbow Coalition, a group of allied but racially separate organizations each focused on helping with issues of poverty and discrimination among their local community while working together towards antiracist and anticapitalist goals.  History  = Precursors = Chicago was one of many American industrial cities that experienced an influx of White Southerners who came seeking employment throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In 1970, Chicago and the neighboring city of Gary had about 280,000 residents who had been born in the South; they were particularly concentrated in the Uptown neighborhood of Chicago, where they made up 80% of the population. The group was culturally isolated, treated as outsiders by other Chicagoans. They often experienced severe poverty and were targets of police brutality. They were derided as \\"hillbillies\\", particularly among the press: the group was summarized in a subtitle to a 1958 article in Harper's Magazine as \\"proud, poor, primitive, and fast with a knife\\". The Uptown neighborhood was home to several youth gangs in the 1950s and 1960s, a number of which formed among the Southern newcomers. The gangs formed \\"not only along the color line, but also along interfaces between different European American groups‚Äîbetween, for example, communities of Irish and Poles, Poles and Italians, Swedes and Italians, Jews and Poles\\". Inter-gang violence was particularly noticeable as Black Americans began to move into Chicago neighborhoods. Amidst this environment, community organizers attempted to address the issues of poverty and unemployment in the area in groups like the Jobs or Income Now (JOIN) community union, which grew out of the Students for a Democratic Society organization that encouraged local activism in Uptown. Both co-founders of the Young Patriots, Jack \\"Junebug\\" Boykin and Doug Youngblood, as well as other members had been involved with JOIN. Boykin and other Young Patriots were also active in Youngblood's National Organizing Committee (later the National Community Union), an interracial and working- class group that rallied around issues including free medical and childcare, higher corporate taxes, rank-and-file union leadership, and the end of the draft. = 1968‚Äì1969: Formation of the Rainbow Coalition = When the Young Patriots Organization and Bob Lee of the Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther Party were accidentally double-booked to speak at the Church of the Three Crosses in Lincoln Park on the same night, the two ended up discussing poverty among impoverished White Southerners in Chicago, shared experiences between White Southerners in Uptown and Black people in the South and West Sides, and comparisons between poverty in Chicago and the Vietnam War. This meeting, which was captured on film and later included in the 1969 documentary film American Revolution 2, was the precursor to the spring 1969 formation of the Rainbow Coalition by Bob Lee and Fred Hampton. At the outset the coalition was made up of the Young Patriots, the Illinois Black Panthers, and the Young Lords, and over the years they were joined by other community organizations. As the coalition expanded, so too did the groups themselves, with the Young Patriots earning new members including the skilled speaker William \\"Preacherman\\" Feserpman, who would go on to become a leader among the Patriots. The Young Patriots maintained their focus on White Southerners and those in the Uptown area after joining the Rainbow Coalition, but usually were joined by one or both of the Black Panthers or the Young Lords in public appearances. = 1969‚Äì1970: Young Patriots Uptown Health Service = The Young Patriots were one of several groups in the Rainbow Coalition to mimic various activities of the Black Panthers. In addition to providing free breakfast programs for children, organizing clothing drives, and monitoring police activities, the Young Patriots also followed the Panthers' model of providing social services such as medical clinics directly to their communities. In October 1969, the Patriots opened a medical clinic to provide free care to Uptown residents. The Young Patriots Uptown Health Service's medical staff were primarily volunteer medical personnel from outside the group, and each patient also was assigned a Patriot as a patient advocate who would provide home visits and accompaniment to later appointments. The clinic provided dental and medical care to about 150 people in the first few months it was open, but by December it had been forced to close due to noise complaints from neighboring tenants. The Patriots alleged the closing was solely due to continued harassment from the police, which they said had scared away clients and staff alike. The clinic relocated, though many of their volunteers did not return. After reopening, the unlicensed clinic faced issues with the Board of Health, who were concerned the Patriots would use the facility to \\"treat gunshot wounds, hand out drugs irresponsibly, perform abortions or give shots with unsterile needles\\". As the Patriots battled with the Board of Health, they alleged that police harassed their patients, seizing prescribed medications and arresting them for narcotics possession. The Patriots also claimed the police harassed their members by crashing meetings between the Patriots and medical staff, and arresting the Patriots for trespassing in their own buildings or for allegedly assaulting other members of the organization. Eventually the clinic was allowed to remain open and unlicensed in a July 10, 1970 decision that determined that \\"ordinance covering dispensaries was so vague as to be unenforceable\\". The clinic treated nearly 2,000 people by November of that year, and came to be the most well-known accomplishment by the Young Patriots. In 1969, a new branch of the Young Patriots emerged, calling themselves the Patriot Party. Over the next year, branches of the Patriots emerged in several cities across the United States, though they generally dissolved fairly quickly due to lack of momentum or were absorbed by other radical groups. = 1970‚Äì1973: Splintering and eventual dissolution = The groups in the Rainbow Coalition had already suffered a major blow with the 1969 assassination of Fred Hampton during a police raid of his apartment. In late 1970, the internal security subcommittee of the United States Senate charged a local church association, the North Side Cooperative Ministry, with financially supporting both the Young Patriots and the Young Lords. Although the consortium maintained that they had only supported free breakfast programs and legal defense funds, and rebutted the claims that they had been supporting violent revolutionaries, the press coverage widely describing the two groups as \\"street gangs\\" reduced outside support for the community services run by the Patriots and other groups. Media attention to the Young Patriots diminished following the success of their medical clinic, and though they continued to provide community services, none would be as effective or widely-known as the clinic. The strongly Appalachian Uptown neighborhood gradually became more diverse as people from other countries immigrated to the area, and White Southerners moved elsewhere. By 1973, the Young Patriots Organization was, for the most part, defunct.  Platform and ideology  In 1970, the Young Patriots formed an eleven-point platform similar to the Black Panther Party's 1969 Ten-Point Program. The Patriots' platform shared the Panthers' opposition to the Vietnam War, police oppression, and capitalist exploitation. The two platforms also shared welfare-related goals including improved education, housing, medical care, and access to clothing, and union reform that would address issues of racism and inefficacy in the existing unions. The Young Patriots' platform included points that spoke about cultural nationalism and revolutionary solidarity, and denounced racism. The Young Patriots' condemnation of cultural nationalism has since been described by Martin Alexander Krzywy, publishing in the Journal of African American Studies, as somewhat incongruous with their strong focus on Appalachian and southern heritage and their adoption of symbols including cowboy hats and the Confederate flag. However, according to Krzywy, this was not dissimilar from inconsistencies between the Black Panthers' and Young Lords' stated beliefs on cultural nationalism and the practices of some of their members. The Confederate flag also served the Young Patriots as a recruiting tool, attracting other white southerners. Though the multiracial groups among the Rainbow Coalition did not raise the Confederate imagery as an issue in the intergroup organizing, many radicals outside of the coalition saw the flag as incompatible with solidarity with the Black Panthers. The Young Patriots were extremely focused on class divides, and were critical of activist groups like the Students for a Democratic Society and the Southern Student Organizing Committee, who were largely focused on campus organizing. The Patriots denigrated their work as \\"petty bourgeoisie\\" and their members as having \\"had all the education, had all the schooling.\\"  Membership  The Young Patriots Organization described their membership as a diverse collection of people including Italians, Latinos, and American Indians. However, the backgrounds of its leaders and the symbols adopted by the group made it clear that the group was primarily centered around shared White Southerner identity. The Patriots were largely perceived by outsiders to be a group of white hillbilly gang members turned revolutionaries. Krzywy, publishing in the Journal of African American Studies, wrote that \\"the Young Patriots tended to conflate Southernness and whiteness, to the exclusion of both poor white ethnics in Chicago and black Southerners who had moved to the city and shared many folkways with the Uptown residents.\\" However, despite the group's exclusive intragroup identity, through the Rainbow Coalition the group organized effectively along with Blacks and Latinos in Chicago.

She was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and was a Progressive Conservative member of the Manitoba Legislature from 1977 to 1981, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Sterling Lyon. Born Norma Lorraine Killeen, the daughter of Clement A. Killeen and Aurora Martel, she was educated at Immaculate Conception School and St. Mary's Academy. She married Howard Wesley Isidor, son of Mrs. A. Baldwin on February 1, 1940. She divorced Howard on 14 January 1959. Married James Percy Price sometime before 1963.

It is told in the first person; the narrator, whose name is never revealed, meets his favorite author and becomes obsessed with discovering the secret meaning or intention of all the author's works. \\"The Figure in the Carpet\\" has evaded definitive interpretation. In his book Henry James (1913), Ford Madox Ford wrote that after it was published, James's contemporaries set themselves on a quest for the Figure as an identifiable physical entity. In the preface to his A Choice of Kipling's Verse (1941), T. S. Eliot wrote, \\"Nowadays, we all look for the Figure in the Carpet.\\" It is possible that James's Figure is a palpable object that, like a talisman, facilitates interpretation of his own work. Plot The narrator, a writer for a literary newspaper, prides himself on his astute review of Hugh Vereker's latest novel. Vereker inadvertently dismisses his efforts, and then to repair his incivility, confides in the narrator that all critics have \\"missed my little point,\\" \\"the particular thing I've written my books most for,\\" \\"the thing for the critic to find,\\" \\"my secret,\\" \\"like a complex figure in a Persian carpet.\\" The narrator racks his brains and, in desperation, tells his friend Corvick about the puzzle. Corvick and his novelist fianc√©e, Gwendolen, pursue \\"the trick\\" without success until Corvick, traveling alone in India, wires Gwendolen and the narrator \\"Eureka! Immense.\\" He refuses to tell Gwendolen the secret until they are married, and then dies in an accident. Since Gwendolen refuses to share her knowledge, the narrator speculates, \\"the figure in the carpet [was] traceable or describable only for husbands and wives--for lovers supremely united.\\" She remarries, and after her death, the narrator approaches her new husband to discover the secret. But the widowed husband is surprised and humiliated by the news of his late wife's great \\"secret,\\" and he and the narrator conclude by sharing the same curiosity. Publication history \\"The Figure in the Carpet\\" first appeared in the periodical Cosmopolis in January/February 1896. In hardcover, it was first published in June 1896 in a volume titled Embarrassments, simultaneously issued by London publisher William Heinemann (1250 copies) and the Macmillan Company in New York (1600 copies).

A photograph (Da Ci'en Temple, Xi'an, China) taken with an original Diana camera. Evident is the typical vignetting and blurring inherent in a Diana image. Within the field of photography, a toy camera is a simple, inexpensive film camera. Despite the name, they are in fact always fully functional and capable of taking photographs, albeit with optical aberrations due to the limitations of the simple lenses. From the 1990s onward, there has been interest in the artistic use of such cameras, both those designed for children such as the Diana, and others originally intended as mass-market consumer cameras, such as the Lomo LC-A, Lubitel, and Holga. Many professional photographers have used toy cameras and exploited the vignetting, blur, light leaks, and other distortions of their inexpensive lenses for artistic effect to take award-winning pictures. Toy camera photography has been widely exhibited at many popular art shows, such as the annual \\"Krappy Kamera\\" show at the Soho Photo Gallery in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City. Various publications such as Popular Photography magazine have extolled the virtues of the Diana camera in its own right as an \\"art\\" producing image maker. Several books have also featured the work of toy cameras, such as The Friends of Photography's The Diana Show, Iowa by Nancy Rexroth, and Angels at the Arno by Eric Lindbloom.  Lomography  The original Lomo LC-A, which inspired the movement Lomography is a genre of photography, involving taking spontaneous photographs with minimal attention to technical details. Lomographic images often exploit unpredictable non-standard optical traits of cheap toy camera (such as light leaks and irregular lens alignment), and non- standard film processing techniques, for aesthetic effect. Similar-looking techniques with digital photography, often involving \\"lomo\\" image postprocessing filters, may also be considered lomographic. The lomography trend peaked in 2011. While cheap plastic toy cameras using film were and are produced by multiple manufactuers, lomography is named after the Soviet-era cameras produced by the \\"Leningradskoye Optiko-Mekhanicheskoye Obyedinenie. Lomography has been a highly social pursuit, with local clubs organized by The Lomographic Society International (Lomographische AG, a commercial company selling lomo cameras). The company promotes the genre; however, it is not necessary to use the company's products to take lomographic photos. \\"Lomography\\" is claimed as a commercial trademark of Lomographische AG, which their creators associate to a photographic image style and a film camera movement and community facilitated by The Lomographic Society International. However, it has become a genericized trademark; most camera phone photo editor apps include a \\"lomo\\" filter. = History = The lomography name is inspired by the former state-run optics manufacturer LOMO PLC of Saint Petersburg, Russia that created and produced the 35 mm LOMO LC-A Compact Automat camera, now central to lomography. This camera was loosely based upon the Cosina CX-1 and introduced in the early 1980s. The LOMO LC-A produces \\"unique, colorful, and sometimes blurry\\" images. Sample shot from a LOMO LC-A The Lomographic Society International was founded in 1992 by a group of Viennese students interested in the LCA, a camera created by LOMO PLC of Saint Petersburg, Russia. Lomography started as an art movement through which the students put on exhibitions of photos; the art movement then developed into the Lomographische AG, a commercial enterprise. = Lomographische AG = Lomographische AG is a commercial company headquartered in Vienna, Austria, which sells cameras, accessories, and film. Lomographische AG signed an exclusive distribution agreement with LOMO PLC in 1995 ‚Äî becoming the sole distributor of all LOMO LC-A cameras outside of the former Soviet Union. The new company reached an agreement with the deputy mayor of St Petersburg, the future Russian Prime Minister and President, Vladimir Putin, to receive a tax break in order to keep the LOMO factory in the city open. Since the introduction of the original LOMO LC-A, Lomographische AG has produced a line of their own film cameras. In 2005, production of the original LOMO LC-A was discontinued. Its replacement, the LOMO LC-A+, was introduced in 2006. The new camera, made in China rather than Russia, featured the original Russian lens manufactured by LOMO PLC. This changed as of mid-2007 with the lens now made in China as well. In 2012 the LC-A+ camera was re-released as a special edition. It costs ten times the original secondhand value of the old LOMO LC-A. The Lomographic Society International (Lomographische AG) has moved into producing their own range of analog cameras, films and accessories. Lomographische AG has also released products catered to digital devices, such as the Smartphone Film Scanner; and the Achromat lens collection for SLR cameras with Canon EF, Nikon F or Pentax K mounts, inspired by 19th century Daguerreotype photography. In 2013, together with Zenit, Lomographische AG produced a new version of the Petzval Lens designed to work with Canon EF and Nikon F mount SLR cameras.

By 1905, the white school had one teacher with 49 pupils and the black school had one teacher with 29 pupils. The area did not become urban until the expansion of Houston city limits in the 1950s, which followed a failed attempt by the entire Spring Branch region to incorporate into a single entity, leading to the establishment of the Memorial Villages. Beginning in the mid-1950s and continuing through the mid-1970s, the school district expanded rapidly. By 1976, the school district had approximately 45,000 students.

By the 1984-85 school year, the student population had dropped from its mid-1970s peak of over 40,000 to approximately 26,844. That year, the school board voted to consolidate certain schools at the end of school year, closing Spring Branch and Westchester Senior High Schools, along with Westchester and Northbrook Junior High Schools.

It is named after Carl Gauss, Rodion Kuzmin, and Eduard Wirsing. It occurs in the study of continued fractions; it is also related to the Riemann zeta function. Relationship to the maps and continued fractions =The Gauss map = File:Gauss function The Gauss function (map) h is : :h(x)=1/x-\\\\lfloor 1/x \\\\rfloor. where: * \\\\lfloor 1/x \\\\rfloor denotes floor function It has an infinite number of jump discontinuities at x = 1/n, for positive integers n. It is hard to approximate it by a single smooth polynomial.A Graduate Introduction to Numerical Methods From the Viewpoint of Backward Error Analysis by Corless, Robert, Fillion, Nicolas =Operator on the maps = The Gauss‚ÄìKuzmin‚ÄìWirsing operator G acts on functions f as :[Gf](x) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {1}{(x+n)^2} f \\\\left(\\\\frac {1}{x+n}\\\\right). =Eigenvalues of the operator= The first eigenfunction of this operator is :\\\\frac 1{\\\\ln 2}\\\\ \\\\frac 1{1+x} which corresponds to an eigenvalue of Œª1=1. This eigenfunction gives the probability of the occurrence of a given integer in a continued fraction expansion, and is known as the Gauss‚ÄìKuzmin distribution. This follows in part because the Gauss map acts as a truncating shift operator for the continued fractions: if : x=[0;a_1,a_2,a_3,\\\\dots] is the continued fraction representation of a number 0 < x < 1, then : h(x)=[0;a_2,a_3,\\\\dots]. Additional eigenvalues can be computed numerically; the next eigenvalue is Œª2 = ‚àí0.3036630029... and its absolute value is known as the Gauss‚ÄìKuzmin‚ÄìWirsing constant. Analytic forms for additional eigenfunctions are not known. It is not known if the eigenvalues are irrational. Let us arrange the eigenvalues of the Gauss‚ÄìKuzmin‚ÄìWirsing operator according to an absolute value: :1=\\\\lambda_{1}\\\\geq \\\\lambda_{2}\\\\geq\\\\lambda_{3}\\\\geq\\\\cdots. It was conjectured in 1995 by Philippe Flajolet and Brigitte Vall√©e that :\\\\lim\\\\limits_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{n}}{\\\\lambda_{n+1}}=-\\\\phi^{2},\\\\text{ where }\\\\phi=\\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2}. In 2014, Giedrius Alkauskas proved this conjecture. Moreover, the following asymptotic result holds: :(-1)^{n+1}\\\\lambda_{n}=\\\\phi^{-2n} +C\\\\cdot\\\\frac{\\\\phi^{-2n}}{\\\\sqrt{n}}+d(n)\\\\cdot\\\\frac{\\\\phi^{-2n}}{n}, \\\\text{ where }C=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt[4]{5}\\\\cdot\\\\zeta(3/2)}{2\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}}=1.1019785625880999_{+}; here the function d(n) is bounded, and \\\\zeta(\\\\star) is the Riemann zeta function. =Continuous spectrum= The eigenvalues form a discrete spectrum, when the operator is limited to act on functions on the unit interval of the real number line. More broadly, since the Gauss map is the shift operator on Baire space \\\\mathbb{N}^\\\\omega, the GKW operator can also be viewed as an operator on the function space \\\\mathbb{N}^\\\\omega\\\\to\\\\mathbb{C} (considered as a Banach space, with basis functions taken to be the indicator functions on the cylinders of the product topology). In the later case, it has a continuous spectrum, with eigenvalues in the unit disk \\\\lambda<1 of the complex plane. That is, given the cylinder C_n[b]= \\\\\\\\{(a_1,a_2,\\\\cdots) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^\\\\omega : a_n = b \\\\\\\\}, the operator G shifts it to the left: GC_n[b] = C_{n-1}[b]. Taking r_{n,b}(x) to be the indicator function which is 1 on the cylinder (when x\\\\in C_n[b]), and zero otherwise, one has that Gr_{n,b}=r_{n-1,b}. The series :f(x)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\lambda^{n-1} r_{n,b}(x) then is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue \\\\lambda. That is, one has [Gf](x)=\\\\lambda f(x) whenever the summation converges: that is, when \\\\lambda<1. A special case arises when one wishes to consider the Haar measure of the shift operator, that is, a function that is invariant under shifts. This is given by the Minkowski measure ?^\\\\prime. That is, one has that G?^\\\\prime = ?^\\\\prime. Relationship to the Riemann zeta function The GKW operator is related to the Riemann zeta function. Note that the zeta function can be written as :\\\\zeta(s)=\\\\frac{1}{s-1}-s\\\\int_0^1 h(x) x^{s-1} \\\\; dx which implies that :\\\\zeta(s)=\\\\frac{s}{s-1}-s\\\\int_0^1 x \\\\left[Gx^{s-1} \\\\right]\\\\, dx by change-of- variable. =Matrix elements= Consider the Taylor series expansions at x=1 for a function f(x) and g(x)=[Gf](x). That is, let :f(1-x)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty (-x)^n \\\\frac{f^{(n)}(1)}{n!} and write likewise for g(x). The expansion is made about x = 1 because the GKW operator is poorly behaved at x = 0\\\\. The expansion is made about 1-x so that we can keep x a positive number, 0 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 1\\\\. Then the GKW operator acts on the Taylor coefficients as :(-1)^m \\\\frac{g^{(m)}(1)}{m!} = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty G_{mn} (-1)^n \\\\frac{f^{(n)}(1)}{n!}, where the matrix elements of the GKW operator are given by :G_{mn}=\\\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k {n \\\\choose k} {k+m+1 \\\\choose m} \\\\left[ \\\\zeta (k+m+2)- 1\\\\right]. This operator is extremely well formed, and thus very numerically tractable. The Gauss‚ÄìKuzmin constant is easily computed to high precision by numerically diagonalizing the upper-left n by n portion. There is no known closed-form expression that diagonalizes this operator; that is, there are no closed-form expressions known for the eigenvectors. =Riemann zeta= The Riemann zeta can be written as :\\\\zeta(s)=\\\\frac{s}{s-1}-s \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty (-1)^n {s-1 \\\\choose n} t_n where the t_n are given by the matrix elements above: :t_n=\\\\sum_{m=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{G_{mn}} {(m+1)(m+2)}. Performing the summations, one gets: :t_n=1-\\\\gamma + \\\\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^k {n \\\\choose k} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{1}{k} - \\\\frac {\\\\zeta(k+1)} {k+1} \\\\right] where \\\\gamma is the Euler‚ÄìMascheroni constant. These t_n play the analog of the Stieltjes constants, but for the falling factorial expansion. By writing :a_n=t_n - \\\\frac{1}{2(n+1)} one gets: a0 = ‚àí0.0772156... and a1 = ‚àí0.00474863... and so on. The values get small quickly but are oscillatory. Some explicit sums on these values can be performed. They can be explicitly related to the Stieltjes constants by re-expressing the falling factorial as a polynomial with Stirling number coefficients, and then solving. More generally, the Riemann zeta can be re-expressed as an expansion in terms of Sheffer sequences of polynomials. This expansion of the Riemann zeta is investigated in the following references. The coefficients are decreasing as :\\\\left(\\\\frac{2n}{\\\\pi}\\\\right)^{1/4}e^{-\\\\sqrt{4\\\\pi n}} \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{4\\\\pi n}-\\\\frac{5\\\\pi}{8}\\\\right) + \\\\mathcal{O} \\\\left(\\\\frac{e^{-\\\\sqrt{4\\\\pi n}}}{n^{1/4}}\\\\right).

It was located in the central part of the province, and is named in honour of Chief Crowfoot, leader of the Blackfoot First Nations in the 19th century. Even by the standards of rural Alberta, Crowfoot was a strongly conservative riding. The major right-wing party of the day--Progressive Conservative (1968-1993), Reform (1993-2000), Canadian Alliance (2000-2003) and Conservative (after 2003)-- won every election in this riding, usually by some of the largest recorded margins in Canadian politics. As a measure of how conservative this riding is, Jack Horner, the riding's original member, crossed the floor to the Liberals in 1977, only to tumble to only 18 percent of the vote in 1979. This electoral district was also home to the largest margin of victory in any federal riding in the 2004 and 2006 federal elections. Conservative candidate Kevin Sorenson won 37,649 votes, or 80.2% of the riding's total in 2004. This represented a difference of 34,034 votes, or 72.5%, from the candidate with the riding's second most votes, Liberal Adam Campbell who only received 3,615 votes, or 7.7% of the riding's votes. It was the riding with the highest Conservative vote in the 2004 and 2006 elections. In 2006, Sorenson increased his vote even further, to 43,009 votes, 82.5% of the total.  Geography  The district included the City of Camrose; the Town of Drumheller; the Municipal District of Acadia No. 34; Wheatland County; Kneehill County; Starland County; the County of Stettler No. 6; the County of Paintearth No. 18; Camrose County; and all of Alberta's three special areas (Nos. 2, 3 and 4).  History  This riding was created in 1966 from parts of Medicine Hat, Acadia, Bow River and Macleod ridings. In 2003, parts of Wild Rose riding were added. It was abolished in 2012. Most of the riding's eastern portion became Battle River‚ÄîCrowfoot, with much of the western portion transferring to Bow River and Red Deer‚ÄîMountain View. Some outer western portions of the riding that had been annexed into Calgary joined Calgary Shepard and Calgary Forest Lawn. = Members of Parliament =  Election results  Note: Conservative vote is compared to the total of Progressive Conservative and Canadian Alliance vote in 2000.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1969 to 1981, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Sterling Lyon. McGill was raised in Brandon, Manitoba, and was educated at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. He worked for Inco Steel from 1933 to 1939. He served in the Royal Canadian Air Force from 1940 to 1945, and later managed the Brandon Flying Club. McGill married Marguerite Eve Shaw in 1942. He served as a director of the Brandon General Hospital, and was a member of the Brandon Police Commission. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1969, defeating New Democrat James Skinner by 504 votes. He was re-elected over New Democrat Henry Carroll by just over 1,000 votes in the 1973 election, and again in the 1977 election. The Progressive Conservatives formed government in 1977, and on October 24 of that year McGill was appointed Consumer, Corporate and Internal Services and Minister of Cooperative Development, with responsibility for the Manitoba Telephone System and Communications and the Manitoba Lotteries Act. After a reshuffling on October 20, 1978, he retained his portfolios and was given responsibility for the Manitoba Telephone System, Manitoba Forestry Resources Limited and the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation. On November 15, 1979, McGill stepped down to the position of Minister without Portfolio. He did not seek re- election in 1981, and has not sought a return to politics since that time. In the legislature, his mild demeanour earned him the ironic nickname \\"Mad Dog McGill\\". Gary Doer described him as \\"gentlemanly\\" following his death in 1996.

In Peru, he is considered a national hero for leading the resistance to Chilean occupation during the War of the Pacific (1879‚Äì1883), where he fought as a General in the Peruvian Army. Early years Andr√©s Avelino C√°ceres was born on November 10, 1833, in the city of Ayacucho.Jorge Basadre, Historia de la Rep√∫blica del Per√∫, Vol. VI, p. 281. His father, Don Domingo C√°ceres y Ore, was a landowner and his mother, Justa Dorregaray Cueva, daughter of the Spanish colonel Demetrio Dorregaray. He was mestizo; one of his maternal ancestors was Catalina Huanca, an Inka-Wanka princess. He studied at the Colegio San Ram√≥n () in his hometown. Military career In 1854, C√°ceres abandoned his studies and joined the Ayacucho Battalion as a cadet. As part of this unit, he participated in the rebellion led by General Ram√≥n Castilla against President Jos√© Rufino Echenique, which ended with the victory of the former at the Battle of La Palma (January 5, 1855). Afterwards, he quickly ascended through the military, obtaining the rank of Second Lieutenant later that year and that of Lieutenant in 1857. Between 1857 and 1859 he actively supported Ram√≥n Castilla's government against a rebellion by former president Manuel Ignacio de Vivanco. During the fighting, C√°ceres was severely wounded in the left eye. =War against Ecuador= When war broke out between Peru and Ecuador in 1859, C√°ceres was still ailing from his wound, but took part in the campaign. After the conflict ended in 1860, Castilla appointed C√°ceres to serve as military attach√© of the Peruvian delegation to France and he traveled there. He received treatment for his eye in Paris. C√°ceres returned to Peru in 1862 and joined the Pichincha Battalion in Huancayo. =War against Spain= During this period, he became known for his outspoken opposition to President Juan Antonio Pezet, who had allowed the Spanish occupation of the Chincha Islands in the Vivanco-Pareja Treaty of 1865. For his criticism he was exiled to Chile with several other officers but they managed to escape, landing at the southern port of Mollendo. They joined the Revoluci√≥n Restauradora del Honor Nacional (National Honor Restoring Revolution) led by Mariano Ignacio Prado against Pezet's government. C√°ceres participated in the occupation of Lima and later, with Prado as president, in the Battle of Callao on May 2, 1866, which forced Spanish naval forces to retreat from Peruvian waters and the Chincha Islands. =Pardo's Presidency= In 1868, C√°ceres decided to end his military career and return to Ayacucho to live as a farmer. However, he returned to the political arena in 1872 opposing colonel Tom√°s Gutierrez's coup against president Manuel Pardo. Pardo was the first civilian President of Peru and founder of the influential Civilista Party which played an important role in Peruvian political history. His support for Pardo's Presidency earned him support from Civilista Party leaders and he was appointed head of the Zepita Battalion. As such, in 1874, he suppressed a rebellion led by future Peruvian President Nicol√°s de Pi√©rola in Moquegua. For this action, he was awarded the rank of colonel and later named prefect of Cuzco. War of the Pacific (1879-1883) =Southern Campaign= At the start of the War of the Pacific, (April 5, 1879), C√°ceres was sent with his Zepita Battalion to the province of Tarapac√°. There, he fought against the Chilean Army in the battles of San Francisco and Tarapac√°. In the latter, his intervention was decisive to achieve a Peruvian victory against heavy odds. Despite this victory, the Peruvian Army proved incapable of stopping the invasion and was forced to retreat north to the province of Tacna. Chileans landed north of this position, at Ilo, from where they attacked the main Peruvian position. C√°ceres played a major role in the reorganization of the Peruvian Southern Army. This Army was deployed around the city of Tacna together with a Bolivian Army led by the President of Bolivia himself, General Narciso Campero. However, the political instability created after Nicol√°s de Pi√©rola successfully overthrew Mariano Ignacio Prado hampered the actions of the Allied Army against the Chileans. On May 26, 1880, the Battle of the Alto de la Alianza was fought, where the Chileans defeated the combined Bolivian-Peruvian Army. C√°ceres had a notable participation in this action after which he retreated to Lima. =Lima Campaign= Chilean charge during the Battle of San Juan. Pi√©rola ordered what was left of the Army to protect the capital, Lima, together with poorly armed citizens which were called to the fight. C√°ceres was then put at the command of the 5th division of the Reserve. With no reinforcements available, and with the Chilean assault force deploying from the south, Peruvian forces were defeated in the battles of San Juan and Miraflores. C√°ceres was wounded in the latter combat and taken to Lima. When the city fell in January 1881, he escaped to Jauja in the mountainous hinterland of Peru. =La Bre√±a Campaign= As the senior officer in the region, C√°ceres was named Political - Military Chief of the departments of the center (April 26, 1881). He dedicated himself to organizing resistance against Chilean occupation, conducting a guerrilla war for which he mobilized the peasant population. Thanks to the local support, the difficult terrain and his own military skills, C√°ceres defeated several Chilean expeditions sent against him at the battles of Pucar√° and another battle there in July 1882, Marcavalle, and La Concepci√≥n. For this feats, he was nicknamed as the Brujo de los Andes (Wizard of the Andes). But in spite of all his talent and resolve, he was finally defeated by the better armed and trained Chilean forces in the Battle of Huamachuco (July 10, 1883). Even though he tried to regroup, a Peruvian government headed by Miguel Iglesias signed the Treaty of Anc√≥n (October 10, 1883), recognizing defeat and bringing an end to the war. First Presidency (1886-1890) After the war, C√°ceres refused to recognize Iglesias as president so a civil war ensued between these two factions. He evaded the enemy's army and attacked Lima on November 28, 1885, forcing Iglesias to resign on December 12. The country was ruled by a Council of Ministers headed by Antonio Arenas while new elections took place. Running for the Constitutional Party, C√°ceres won the elections as sole candidate and assumed as president on June 3, 1886. The new government faced a serious economic crisis due to a huge debt and the severe damage caused by the War of the Pacific. As a solution for these problems, the C√°ceres administration engaged in negotiations with its creditors, the result of which was the Grace Contract, signed on October 28, 1888, and approved by the Congress of Peru on October 25, 1889. Under the agreement, the Peruvian State handed over control of its railways, a guano concession, annual payments over 33 years and several minor concessions. In exchange, its creditors agreed to pay the country's debt and expand its railways. The Grace Contract caused widespread controversy, the C√°ceres administration was accused of having sold the country's main assets at a very low price among other things. In any case, the agreement allowed the government to solve its external debt problem and assured the expansion of Peruvian railways at a time when there were no public resources whatsoever for either task. Other initiatives undertaken during this period included the end of the use of banknotes as legal tender the separation of State incomes between those of the central government and those of the departments, and a partial consolidation of the internal debt. After the victory of Remigio Morales, the official candidate in the presidential elections of April 13, 1890, C√°ceres transferred power to his successor on August 10 of the same year. Second Presidency (1894-1895) Morales Berm√∫dez died in office on April 1, 1894, and was replaced by Vice President of Peru Justiniano Borgo√±o. Subsequent presidential elections were won by C√°ceres amid accusations of fraud. His second term was inaugurated on August 10, 1894. There were widespread outbreaks of rebellion throughout the country, which eventually united under the leadership of former president Nicol√°s de Pi√©rola. Rebel forces attacked Lima on March 17, 1895, the ensuing fight was stopped two days later by an armistice signed under the auspices of the diplomatic corps. Recognizing his defeat and unpopularity, C√°ceres resigned and was replaced by an interim Government Junta. Later years After his downfall, C√°ceres lived in Buenos Aires, Argentina from 1895 until 1899. He returned to Per√∫ but left again, this time for Europe where he served as Peruvian ambassador in the Kingdom of Italy (1905‚Äì1911) and the German Empire (1911‚Äì1914). Back in Lima, he supported Augusto B. Legu√≠a in his campaign for the presidency and his successful coup against Jos√© Pardo in 1919. The new government awarded him the rank of Marshal on November 10, 1919. C√°ceres died on October 10, 1923, in the town of Anc√≥n at the age of 86.Jorge Basadre, Historia de la Rep√∫blica del Per√∫, Vol. IX, p. 296. Legacy In Peru, C√°ceres is regarded as a nationalist figure. His image symbolizes resistance against foreign forces for his opposition to the Spanish occupation of the Chincha Islands and, more importantly, for organizing resistance against Chile, Peru's traditional enemy. In recent years, in acknowledgement of this symbolism, a group of Peruvian military veterans have organized and adopted the name etnocacerista after C√°ceres. Etnocaceristas now compose the bulk of the support for the Peruvian Nationalist Party. An interesting legacy is found in the person of Zoila Aurora C√°ceres, one of his daughters, who left behind a rich oeuvre of writing.

The koza comes from the southern mountainous region of Poland known as Podhale and differs considerably from other types of bagpipes in its construction. Its scale is: b,c,d,e,f,g (with drones on B, f and b). The instrument is known for producing a continuous, low pitch. Construction and appearance Unlike other bagpipes, the koza has three drones: one in the separate drone-pipe, and two in the chanter, which has three channels. This wind instrument consists of a single reed pipe, often made of a cane blade lapped onto copper tubing set into motion when wind is fed by arm pressure on a goat-skin bag. The pipe is held in a wooden socket tied into the bag, which is inflated by the mouth (through a blowpipe with a leather nonreturn valve). The finger holes of the pipe, or chanter, play melodies while the remaining pipes, or drones, sound single notes tuned against the chanter by means of extendable joints.

Early life and education Rockwell was born November 5, 1968, in Daly City, California. He is the only child of actors Pete Rockwell and Penny Hess. After their divorce when he was five, he was raised by his father in San Francisco, and spent his summers with his mother in New York. At age 10, he made a brief stage appearance playing Humphrey Bogart in an East Village improv comedy sketch with his mother.‚ÄúSam Rockwell,‚Äù by Miranda Spencer. Biography, January 2003. He started high school at the San Francisco School of the Arts with Margaret Cho and Aisha Tyler, but received his high school diploma from Urban Pioneers, an Outward Bound-style alternative school. Rockwell explained, \\"I just wanted to get stoned, flirt with girls, go to parties.\\" The school \\"had a reputation as a place stoners went because it was easy to graduate.\\" The school ended up helping him regain an interest in performing. After appearing in an independent film during his senior year, he moved to New York to pursue an acting career. He later enrolled in the Professional Actor Training Program at the William Esper Studio in New York. Career =Early films= After his debut role in the horror film Clownhouse in 1989, which he filmed while living in San Francisco, he moved to New York and trained at the William Esper Studios with teacher William Esper. His career slowly gained momentum in the early 1990s, when he alternated between small-screen guest spots in TV series like The Equalizer, NYPD Blue and Law & Order and small roles in films such as Last Exit to Brooklyn and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. He also appeared as the title character in The Search for One-eye Jimmy (1994). During this time, Rockwell worked in restaurants as a busboy and delivered burritos by bicycle.‚ÄúSam Rockwell,‚Äù by M.B. Rolling Stone, 10/3/02. At one point, Rockwell even worked as a private detective's assistant. \\"I tailed a chick who was having an affair and took pictures of her at this motel\\", he told Rolling Stone in 2002. \\"It was pretty sleazy.\\" A well-paying Miller commercial in 1994 finally allowed him to pursue acting full-time. The turning point in Rockwell's career was Tom DiCillo's film Box of Moonlight (1996), in which he played an eccentric man-child who dresses like Davy Crockett and lives in an isolated mobile home. The ensuing acclaim put him front and center with casting agents and newfound fans alike, with Rockwell himself acknowledging that \\"That film was definitely a turning point...I was sort of put on some independent film map after 10 years in New York.\\" He also received strong reviews for the film Lawn Dogs (1997), where he played a working-class lawn mower who befriends a wealthy 10-year-old girl (Mischa Barton) in an upper-class gated community in Kentucky; Rockwell's performance won him Best Actor honors at both the Montreal World Film Festival and the Catalan International Film Festival. In 1999, Rockwell played prisoner William \\"Wild Bill\\" Wharton in the Stephen King prison drama The Green Mile. At the time of the film's shooting, Rockwell explained why he was attracted to playing such unlikable characters. He said, \\"I like that dark stuff. I think heroes should be flawed. There's a bit of self-loathing in there, and a bit of anger... But after this, I've really got to play some lawyers, or a British aristocrat, or they'll put a label on me.\\" =Hollywood recognition= After appearances as a bumbling actor in the sci-fi parody Galaxy Quest (1999), as Francis Flute in the Shakespeare adaptation A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999), and as gregarious villain Eric Knox in Charlie's Angels (2000), Rockwell won the then-biggest leading role of his career as The Gong Show host Chuck Barris in George Clooney's directorial debut, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002). Rockwell's performance was well-received, and the film earned generally positive reviews. Rockwell has also received positive notices for his role opposite Nicolas Cage in Ridley Scott's Matchstick Men (2003), with Entertainment Weekly calling him \\"destined by a kind of excessive interestingness to forever be a colorful sidekick.\\" He received somewhat more mixed reviews as Zaphod Beeblebrox in the film version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005). He then had a notable supporting role as Charley Ford, brother of Casey Affleck's character Robert Ford, in the well-received drama The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), in which Brad Pitt played the lead role of Jesse James. According to an interview on The Howard Stern Show, director Jon Favreau considered casting him as the titular character in Iron Man as the studio was initially hesitant to work with Robert Downey Jr., who had been considered for his role in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Rockwell eventually appeared in Iron Man 2, released in 2010, as Tony Stark's rival weapons developer, Justin Hammer. He is said to have accepted the role without reading the script. He had never heard of the character before he was contacted about the role and was unaware that Hammer is an old man in the comic books.

Rangaku (Ky≈´jitai: /Shinjitai: , literally \\"Dutch learning\\", and by extension \\"Western learning\\") is a body of knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch enclave of Dejima, which allowed Japan to keep abreast of Western technology and medicine in the period when the country was closed to foreigners, 1641‚Äì1853, because of the Tokugawa shogunate's policy of national isolation (sakoku). A meeting of Japan, China, and the West, Shiba K≈çkan, late 18th century. Through Rangaku, some people in Japan learned many aspects of the scientific and technological revolution occurring in Europe at that time, helping the country build up the beginnings of a theoretical and technological scientific base, which helps to explain Japan's success in its radical and speedy modernization following the forced American opening of the country to foreign trade in 1854. History Replica of an East Indiaman of the Dutch East India Company/United East Indies Company (VOC) , Nishikawa Joken, 1708. Tokyo National Museum. The Dutch traders at Dejima in Nagasaki were the only European foreigners tolerated in Japan from 1639 until 1853 (the Dutch had a trading post in Hirado from 1609 till 1641 before they had to move to Dejima), and their movements were carefully watched and strictly controlled, being limited initially to one yearly trip to give their homage to the sh≈çgun in Edo. They became instrumental, however, in transmitting to Japan some knowledge of the industrial and scientific revolution that was occurring in Europe: the Japanese purchased and translated scientific books from the Dutch, obtained from them Western curiosities and manufactures (such as clocks, medical instruments, celestial and terrestrial globes, maps and plant seeds) and received demonstrations of Western innovations, including of electrical phenomena, as well as the flight of a hot air balloon in the early 19th century. While other European countries faced ideological and political battles associated with the Protestant Reformation, the Netherlands were a free state, attracting leading thinkers such as Ren√© Descartes. Altogether, thousands of such books were published, printed, and circulated. Japan had one of the largest urban populations in the world, with more than one million inhabitants in Edo, and many other large cities such as Osaka and Kyoto, offering a large, literate market to such novelties. In the large cities some shops, open to the general public, specialized in foreign curiosities. =Beginnings (1640‚Äì1720)= Painting by Kawahara Keiga: Arrival of a Dutch Ship. Philipp Franz von Siebold at Dejima with his Japanese wife Otaki and their baby daughter Ine observing a VOC ship in Nagasaki Bay using a telescope. The first phase of Rangaku was quite limited and highly controlled. After the relocation of the Dutch trading post to Dejima, trade as well as the exchange of information and the activities of the remaining Westerners (dubbed \\"Red-Heads\\" (k≈çm≈çjin)) were restricted considerably. Western books were prohibited, with the exemption of books on nautical and medical matters. Initially, a small group of hereditary Japanese‚ÄìDutch translators labored in Nagasaki to smooth communication with the foreigners and transmit bits of Western novelties. The Dutch were requested to give updates of world events and to supply novelties to the sh≈çgun every year on their trips to Edo. Finally, the Dutch factories in Nagasaki, in addition to their official trade work in silk and deer hides, were allowed to engage in some level of \\"private trade\\". A small, lucrative market for Western curiosities thus developed, focused on the Nagasaki area. With the establishment of a permanent post for a surgeon at the Dutch trading post Dejima, high-ranking Japanese officials started to ask for treatment in cases when local doctors were of no help. One of the most important surgeons was Caspar Schamberger, who induced a continuing interest in medical books, instruments, pharmaceuticals, treatment methods etc. During the second half of the 17th century high-ranking officials ordered telescopes, clocks, oil paintings, microscopes, spectacles, maps, globes, birds, dogs, donkeys, and other rarities for their personal entertainment and for scientific studies.W Michel, Medicine and Allied Sciences in the Cultural Exchange between Japan and Europe in the Seventeenth Century.

Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht Unipress, G√∂ttingen 2007, , S. 285‚Äì302 pdf. =Liberalization of Western knowledge (1720‚Äì)= Description of a microscope in , 1787. Although most Western books were forbidden from 1640, rules were relaxed under sh≈çgun Tokugawa Yoshimune in 1720, which started an influx of Dutch books and their translations into Japanese. One example is the 1787 publication of Morishima Ch≈´ry≈ç‚Äôs , recording much knowledge received from the Dutch. The book details a vast array of topics: it includes objects such as microscopes and hot air balloons; discusses Western hospitals and the state of knowledge of illness and disease; outlines techniques for painting and printing with copper plates; it describes the makeup of static electricity generators and large ships; and it relates updated geographical knowledge. Between 1804 and 1829, schools opened throughout the country by the Shogunate (Bakufu) as well as terakoya (temple schools) helped spread the new ideas further. By that time, Dutch emissaries and scientists were allowed much more free access to Japanese society. The German physician Philipp Franz von Siebold, attached to the Dutch delegation, established exchanges with Japanese students. He invited Japanese scientists to show them the marvels of Western science, learning, in return, much about the Japanese and their customs. In 1824, von Siebold began a medical school in the outskirts of Nagasaki. Soon this grew into a meeting place for about fifty students from all over the country. While receiving a thorough medical education they helped with the naturalistic studies of von Siebold. =Expansion and politicization (1839‚Äì)= The Myriad year clock, a Japanese-made perpetual clock-watch (wadokei), made by Tanaka Hisashige in 1851 (National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo). The Rangaku movement became increasingly involved in Japan's political debate over foreign isolation, arguing that the imitating of Western culture would strengthen rather than harm Japan. The Rangaku increasingly disseminated contemporary Western innovations. In 1839, scholars of Western studies (called Ëò≠Â≠¶ËÄÖ \\"rangaku-sha\\") briefly suffered repression by the Edo shogunate in the incident, due to their opposition to the introduction of the death penalty against foreigners (other than Dutch) coming ashore, recently enacted by the Bakufu. The incident was provoked by actions such as the Morrison Incident, in which an unarmed American merchant ship was fired upon under the Edict to Repel Foreign Ships. The edict was eventually repealed in 1842. Rangaku ultimately became obsolete when Japan opened up during the last decades of the Tokugawa regime (1853‚Äì67). Students were sent abroad, and foreign employees (o-yatoi gaikokujin) came to Japan to teach and advise in large numbers, leading to an unprecedented and rapid modernization of the country. It is often argued that Rangaku kept Japan from being completely uninformed about the critical phase of Western scientific advancement during the 18th and 19th century, allowing Japan to build up the beginnings of a theoretical and technological scientific base. This openness could partly explain Japan's success in its radical and speedy modernization following the opening of the country to foreign trade in 1854. Types =Medical sciences= Japan's first full translation of a Western book on anatomy (Kaitai Shinsho), published in 1774. (National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo). From around 1720, books on medical sciences were obtained from the Dutch, and then analyzed and translated into Japanese. Great debates occurred between the proponents of traditional Chinese medicine and those of the new Western learning, leading to waves of experiments and dissections. The accuracy of Western learning made a sensation among the population, and new publications such as the of 1759 and the of 1774 became references. The latter was a compilation made by several Japanese scholars, led by Sugita Genpaku, mostly based on the Dutch-language Ontleedkundige Tafelen of 1734, itself a translation of Anatomische Tabellen (1732) by the German author Johann Adam Kulmus. A Western book on medicine, translated into Kanbun, published in March 1808 In 1804, Hanaoka Seish≈´ performed the world's first general anaesthesia during surgery for breast cancer (mastectomy). The surgery involved combining Chinese herbal medicine and Western surgery techniques,\\"The first use of general anaesthesia probably dates to early nineteenth century Japan. On 13 October 1804, Japanese doctor Seishu Hanaoka (1760‚Äì1835) surgically removed a breast tumor under general anaesthesia. His patient was a 60-year-old woman named Kan Aiya.\\" Source 40 years before the better-known Western innovations of Long, Wells and Morton, with the introduction of diethyl ether (1846) and chloroform (1847) as general anaesthetics. In 1838, the physician and scholar Ogata K≈çan established the Rangaku school named Tekijuku. Famous alumni of the Tekijuku include Fukuzawa Yukichi and ≈åtori Keisuke, who would become key players in Japan's modernization. He was the author of 1849's , which was the first book on Western pathology to be published in Japan. =Physical sciences= Some of the first scholars of Rangaku were involved with the assimilation of 17th century theories in the physical sciences. This is the case of Shizuki Tadao (:ja:ÂøóÁ≠ëÂø†ÈõÑ) an eighth-generation descendant of the Shizuki house of Nagasaki Dutch translators, who after having completed for the first time a systematic analysis of Dutch grammar, went on to translate the Dutch edition of Introductio ad Veram Physicam of the British author John Keil on the theories of Newton (Japanese title: , 1798). Shizuki coined several key scientific terms for the translation, which are still in use in modern Japanese; for example, , (as in electromagnetism), and . A second Rangaku scholar, Hoashi Banri (:ja:Â∏ÜË∂≥‰∏áÈáå), published a manual of physical sciences in 1810 ‚Äì ‚Äì based on a combination of thirteen Dutch books, after learning Dutch from just one Dutch-Japanese dictionary. =Electrical sciences= Japan's first electrostatic generator (1776), called Elekiteru, developed through Rangaku. (National Museum of Nature and Science). curio shop in Osaka demonstrating and selling an Elekiteru. The sign at the entrance says \\"Newest curiosities from foreign countries.\\" Japan's first manual on electric phenomena by Hashimoto Soukichi, published in 1811. Electrical experiments were widely popular from around 1770. Following the invention of the Leyden jar in 1745, similar electrostatic generators were obtained for the first time in Japan from the Dutch around 1770 by Hiraga Gennai. Static electricity was produced by the friction of a glass tube with a gold-plated stick, creating electrical effects. The jars were reproduced and adapted by the Japanese, who called it . As in Europe, these generators were used as curiosities, such as making sparks fly from the head of a subject or for supposed pseudoscientific medical advantages. In Sayings of the Dutch, the elekiteru is described as a machine that allows one to take sparks out of the human body, to treat sick parts. Elekiterus were sold widely to the public in curiosity shops. Many electric machines derived from the elekiteru were then invented, particularly by Sakuma Sh≈çzan. Japan's first electricity manual, by Hashimoto Soukichi (:ja:Ê©ãÊú¨ÂÆóÂêâ), published in 1811, describes electrical phenomena, such as experiments with electric generators, conductivity through the human body, and the 1750 experiments of Benjamin Franklin with lightning. =Chemistry= Volta battery in Udagawa's Opening Principles of Chemistry, published in 1840. The title reads \\"Decomposition of an alkali with a Volta column.\\" Chemical experiments in Udagawa's 1840 Seimi Kais≈ç. In 1840, Udagawa Y≈çan published his , a compilation of scientific books in Dutch, which describes a wide range of scientific knowledge from the West. Most of the Dutch original material appears to be derived from William Henry‚Äôs 1799 Elements of Experimental Chemistry. In particular, the book contains a detailed description of the electric battery invented by Volta forty years earlier in 1800. The battery itself was constructed by Udagawa in 1831 and used in experiments, including medical ones, based on a belief that electricity could help cure illnesses. Udagawa's work reports for the first time in details the findings and theories of Lavoisier in Japan. Accordingly, Udagawa made scientific experiments and created new scientific terms, which are still in current use in modern scientific Japanese, like , , , and . =Optical sciences= Telescopes Edo women using a telescope. Early 19th century. Japan's first telescope was offered by the English captain John Saris to Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1614, with the assistance of William Adams, during Saris's mission to open trade between England and Japan. This followed the invention of the telescope by Dutchman Hans Lippershey in 1608 by a mere six years. Refracting telescopes were widely used by the populace during the Edo period, both for pleasure and for the observation of the stars. After 1640, the Dutch continued to inform the Japanese about the evolution of telescope technology. Until 1676 more than 150 telescopes were brought to Nagasaki.Wolfgang Michel, On Japanese Imports of Optical Instruments in the Early Edo-Era. Y≈çgaku - Annals of the History of Western Learning in Japan, Vol. 12 (2004), pp. 119-164 . In 1831, after having spent several months in Edo where he could get accustomed with Dutch wares, Kunitomo Ikkansai (a former gun manufacturer) built Japan's first reflecting telescope of the Gregorian type. Kunitomo's telescope had a magnification of 60, and allowed him to make very detailed studies of sun spots and lunar topography. Four of his telescopes remain to this day. File:Kunitomo1832Telescope.jpgKunitomo's reflecting telescope, 1831. File:KunitomoMoon1836.jpgObservation of the moon by Kunitomo in 1836. Microscopes Microscopes were invented in the Netherlands during the 17th century, but it is unclear when exactly they reached Japan. Clear descriptions of microscopes are made in the 1720 and in the 1787 book Saying of the Dutch. Although Europeans mainly used microscopes to observe small cellular organisms, the Japanese mainly used them for entomological purposes, creating detailed descriptions of insects. Magic lanterns Mechanism of a magic lantern, from Tengu-ts≈´, 1779 Magic lanterns, first described in the West by Athanasius Kircher in 1671, became very popular attractions in multiple forms in 18th-century Japan. The mechanism of a magic lantern, called was described using technical drawings in the book titled in 1779. =Mechanical sciences= Automata Tea- serving karakuri, with mechanism, 19th century. National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo. Karakuri are mechanized puppets or automata from Japan from the 18th century to 19th century. The word means \\"device\\" and carries the connotations of mechanical devices as well as deceptive ones. Japan adapted and transformed the Western automata, which were fascinating the likes of Descartes, giving him the incentive for his mechanist theories of organisms, and Frederick the Great, who loved playing with automatons and miniature wargames. Many were developed, mostly for entertainment purposes, ranging from tea-serving to arrow-shooting mechanisms. These ingenious mechanical toys were to become prototypes for the engines of the industrial revolution. They were powered by spring mechanisms similar to those of clocks. Clocks An 18th-century wadokei (Japanese clock). Mechanical clocks were introduced into Japan by Jesuit missionaries or Dutch merchants in the sixteenth century. These clocks were of the lantern clock design, typically made of brass or iron, and used the relatively primitive verge and foliot escapement. These led to the development of an original Japanese clock, called Wadokei. Neither the pendulum nor the balance spring were in use among European clocks of the period, and as such they were not included among the technologies available to the Japanese clockmakers at the start of the isolationist period in Japanese history, which began in 1641. As the length of an hour changed during winter, Japanese clock makers had to combine two clockworks in one clock. While drawing from European technology they managed to develop more sophisticated clocks, leading to spectacular developments such as the Universal Myriad year clock designed in 1850 by the inventor Tanaka Hisashige, the founder of what would become the Toshiba corporation. Pumps Vacuum pump drawing by Udagawa, 1834 Description of perpetual lamps (ÁÑ°Â∞ΩÁÅØ) using compressed air fuelling mechanisms Air gun developed by Kunitomo, circa 1820‚Äì1830 Air pump mechanisms became popular in Europe from around 1660 following the experiments of Boyle. In Japan, the first description of a vacuum pump appear in Aochi Rins≈ç (:ja:ÈùíÂú∞ÊûóÂÆó)‚Äôs 1825 , and slightly later pressure pumps and void pumps appear in Udagawa Shinsai (ÂÆáÁî∞Â∑ùÊ¶õÊñé(ÁéÑÁúü))‚Äôs 1834 . These mechanisms were used to demonstrate the necessity of air for animal life and combustion, typically by putting a lamp or a small dog in a vacuum, and were used to make calculations of pressure and air density. Many practical applications were found as well, such as in the manufacture of air guns by Kunitomo Ikkansai, after he repaired and analyzed the mechanism of some Dutch air guns which had been offered to the sh≈çgun in Edo. A vast industry of developed, also derived by Kunitomo from the mechanism of air guns, in which oil was continuously supplied through a compressed air mechanism.Seeing and Enjoying Technology of Edo, p. 25. Kunitomo developed agricultural applications of these technologies, such as a giant pump powered by an ox, to lift irrigation water.

First demonstration of a hot air balloon in Umegasaki, Japan, in 1805 by Johann Caspar Horner. The first flight of a hot air balloon by the brothers Montgolfier in France in 1783, was reported less than four years later by the Dutch in Dejima, and published in the 1787 Sayings of the Dutch. In 1805, almost twenty years later, the Swiss Johann Caspar Horner and the Prussian Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff, two scientists of the Kruzenshtern mission that also brought the Russian ambassador Nikolai Rezanov to Japan, made a hot air balloon out of Japanese paper (washi) and made a demonstration of the new technology in front of about 30 Japanese delegates.Ivan Federovich Kruzenshtern. \\"Voyage round the world in the years 1803, 1804, 1805 and 1806, on orders of his Imperial Majesty Alexander the First, on the vessels Nadezhda and Neva\\". Hot air balloons would mainly remain curiosities, becoming the object of experiments and popular depictions, until the development of military usages during the early Meiji period. Steam engines Drawing from the Japanese book Odd Devices of the Far West, completed in 1845 but published in 1854 A steamship described in Odd Devices of the Far West Japan's first steam engine, manufactured in 1853 by Tanaka Hisashige Knowledge of the steam engine started to spread in Japan during the first half of the 19th century, although the first recorded attempts at manufacturing one date to the efforts of Tanaka Hisashige in 1853, following the demonstration of a steam engine by the Russian embassy of Yevfimiy Putyatin after his arrival in Nagasaki on August 12, 1853. The Rangaku scholar Kawamoto K≈çmin completed a book named in 1845, which was finally published in 1854 as the need to spread Western knowledge became even more obvious with Commodore Perry‚Äôs opening of Japan and the subsequent increased contact with industrial Western nations. The book contains detailed descriptions of steam engines and steamships. Kawamoto had apparently postponed the book's publication due to the Bakufu's prohibition against the building of large ships. =Geography= Papier-m√¢ch√© globe created by Shibukawa Shunkai in 1695. One of the Important Cultural Properties of Japan. Exhibit in the National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo. Topographical work via European methods, 1848 print from Japanese world map published in 1792, by Shiba K≈çkan, Modern geographical knowledge of the world was transmitted to Japan during the 17th century through Chinese prints of Matteo Ricci's maps as well as globes brought to Edo by chiefs of the VOC trading post Dejima. This knowledge was regularly updated through information received from the Dutch, so that Japan had an understanding of the geographical world roughly equivalent to that of contemporary Western countries. With this knowledge, Shibukawa Shunkai made the first Japanese globe in 1690. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, considerable efforts were made at surveying and mapping the country, usually with Western techniques and tools. The most famous maps using modern surveying techniques were made by In≈ç Tadataka between 1800 and 1818 and used as definitive maps of Japan for nearly a century. They do not significantly differ in accuracy with modern ones, just like contemporary maps of European lands. =Biology= Animal plate by It≈ç Keisuke. Description of insects in the Sayings of the Dutch, 1787. The first gibbon brought to Japan in modern times (1809), drawn by Mori Sosen The description of the natural world made considerable progress through Rangaku; this was influenced by the Encyclopedists and promoted by von Siebold (a German doctor in the service of the Dutch at Dejima). It≈ç Keisuke created books describing animal species of the Japanese islands, with drawings of a near-photographic quality. Entomology was extremely popular, and details about insects, often obtained through the use of microscopes (see above), were widely publicized. In a rather rare case of \\"reverse Rangaku\\" (that is, the science of isolationist Japan making its way to the West), an 1803 treatise on the raising of silk worms and manufacture of silk, the was brought to Europe by von Siebold and translated into French and Italian in 1848, contributing to the development of the silk industry in Europe. Plants were requested by the Japanese and delivered from the 1640s on, including flowers such as precious tulips and useful items such as the cabbage and the tomato. = Other publications = * Automatons: , 1730. * Mathematics: . * Optics: . * Glass-making: . * Military: , by Takano Ch≈çei concerning the tactics of the Prussian Army, 1850. * Description of the method of amalgam for gold plating in , or in Shinjitai, by Inaba Shin'emon (Á®≤ËëâÊñ∞Âè≥Ë°õÈñÄ), 1781. Aftermath =Commodore Perry= Sh≈çhei Maru was built from Dutch technical drawings. When Commodore Perry obtained the signature of treaties at the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854, he brought technological gifts to the Japanese representatives. Among them was a small telegraph and a small steam train complete with tracks. These were promptly studied by the Japanese as well. Essentially considering the arrival of Western ships as a threat and a factor for destabilization, the Bakufu ordered several of its fiefs to build warships along Western designs. These ships, such as the H≈ç≈ç-Maru, the Sh≈çhei- Maru, and the Asahi-Maru, were designed and built, mainly based on Dutch books and plans. Some were built within a mere year or two of Perry's visit. Similarly, steam engines were immediately studied. Tanaka Hisashige, who had made the Myriad year clock, created Japan's first steam engine, based on Dutch drawings and the observation of a Russian steam ship in Nagasaki in 1853. These developments led to the Satsuma fief building Japan's first steam ship, the (Èõ≤Ë°å‰∏∏), in 1855, barely two years after Japan's first encounter with such ships in 1853 during Perry's visit. In 1858, the Dutch officer Kattendijke commented: =Last phase of \\"Dutch\\" learning= The Nagasaki Naval Training Center, in Nagasaki, next to Dejima Following Commodore Perry's visit, the Netherlands continued to have a key role in transmitting Western know-how to Japan for some time. The Bakufu relied heavily on Dutch expertise to learn about modern Western shipping methods. Thus, the Nagasaki Naval Training Center was established in 1855 right at the entrance of the Dutch trading post of Dejima, allowing for maximum interaction with Dutch naval knowledge. From 1855 to 1859, education was directed by Dutch naval officers, before the transfer of the school to Tsukiji in Tokyo, where English educators became prominent. The center was equipped with Japan's first steam warship, the Kank≈ç Maru, given by the government of the Netherlands the same year, which may be one of the last great contributions of the Dutch to Japanese modernization, before Japan opened itself to multiple foreign influences. The future Admiral Enomoto Takeaki was one of the students of the Training Center. He was also sent to the Netherlands for five years (1862‚Äì1867), with several other students, to develop his knowledge of naval warfare, before coming back to become the admiral of the sh≈çguns fleet. =Enduring influence of Rangaku= Scholars of Rangaku continued to play a key role in the modernization of Japan. Scholars such as Fukuzawa Yukichi, ≈åtori Keisuke, Yoshida Sh≈çin, Katsu Kaish≈´, and Sakamoto Ry≈çma built on the knowledge acquired during Japan's isolation and then progressively shifted the main language of learning from Dutch to English. As these Rangaku scholars usually took a pro-Western stance, which was in line with the policy of the Shogunate (Bakufu) but against anti- foreign imperialistic movements, several were assassinated, such as Sakuma Sh≈çzan in 1864 and Sakamoto Ry≈çma in 1867.

It is licensed to Saint Paul, Minnesota, although it was licensed to Hudson, Wisconsin from 1997 to 2005. The station's signal covers the Minneapolis-St. Paul media market. The transmitter and towers are located in Woodbury, Minnesota along South Washington County Highway 19. WREY broadcasts a Regional Mexican music format, at 3,000 watts by day and 2,400 watts at night. El Rey has a translator station at 94.9 FM in Saint Paul, Minnesota. History The 630 kHz frequency is perhaps best known as the longtime home of KDWB from 1959 until 1986. For almost two decades, KDWB was a heated rival of the original WDGY, located at 1130 kHz. When WDGY dropped its call letters in 1991 to become KFAN, KDWB's owner adopted the abandoned WDGY call sign for 630 kHz, where it remained until 2008. =Early history= The station signed on in 1951 at 1590 kHz as WCOW, playing country and old-time music. In its early days, WCOW signed on with a cowbell. The station's owners, the Tedesco brothers (Vic, Nick and Al), had previously launched WSHB in Stillwater, Minnesota, and attempted the following year to get into television on channel 17 but financial backing fell through. The channel 17 allocation was later awarded to Twin Cities Public Television in 1965. =63 KDWB= WCOW was not very successful, so the station transitioned to a female-oriented format with the call sign WISK in 1957, and the frequency was changed to 630 kHz. the next year. This format was also unsuccessful, so WISK tried a pop/rock format that was also unsuccessful. The station was soon sold to Crowell-Collier Broadcasting Company, which owned KFWB and KEWB in California. The Top 40 format of those stations was used to launch the new KDWB on October 1, 1959. KDWB quickly became a major competitor to WDGY, which had been playing a pop music format for a few years. With the 630 kHz frequency, KDWB called itself \\"Channel 63\\" and the station began its long uninterrupted run as a pop music station. KDWB and WDGY were fierce rivals throughout the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1970s, the two top-40 stations saw new competition as KSTP and WYOO (U100) picked up the format. In 1976, Fairchild Industries, owner of U100 (which operated as a simulcast at 980 AM and 101.3 FM), decided to divest the stations. KDWB owner Doubleday Broadcasting acquired the FM station. On September 16, 1976, with the sale closed, KDWB signed on its FM simulcast. Within the next three years, KDWB's Top 40 rivals gradually dropped out of the format. U100 was gone in the sale of its AM/FM combo. WDGY flipped to country music in September 1977. KSTP began to lean adult top 40 during the late 1970s and slowly evolved into its longtime news/talk format by the early 1980s. By the end of the decade, KDWB was the only Top 40 station in the market. With the Top-40 competition gone, KDWB-FM split apart from its AM sister in September 1979 and became a pop/rock hybrid as \\"K101.\\" K101 quickly morphed into \\"Stereo 101,\\" an album oriented rock station designed to compete with KQRS-FM, which had recently dumped its free-form rock presentation and had adopted a stricter playlist. \\"Stereo 101\\" proved to be mildly successful, even topping KQRS in the ratings several times. During the four-year run of Stereo 101, new Top 40 stations began appearing on the FM dial, first with WLOL in December 1981, which quickly became one of the most successful stations in the market and later an attempt by WCCO-FM, which was not nearly as successful. Both moves crippled 63 KDWB's longtime dominance of the format, since it was at a disadvantage with its limited AM signal compared to the more powerful and clearer FM signals. The massive top three ratings success of WLOL, combined with rapidly falling ratings for AM stations in general, resulted in Stereo 101 ditching AOR in early 1984 and returning the KDWB calls to Top 40 as \\"KDWB FM 101,\\" this time as the dominant station in the AM/FM combo. Over the next two years, both stations aired similar formats and continued to simulcast from time to time, until the AM station split off on its own early in May 1986 with an automated syndicated oldies format from Unistar as \\"K63,\\" meeting with mild success.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1986/RR-1986-05-16.pdf =630 AM becomes WDGY, goes dark, returns= In August 1991, 630 AM picked up the WDGY call letters after 1130 AM abandoned them to become KFAN. The new WDGY adopted a classic country music format, similar to what had been aired on 1130 kHz throughout the 1980s.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1991/RR-1991-08-30.pdf Ratings for the country format did not meet expectations, and in September 1992, the station temporarily returned to a simulcast with KDWB. (The legal ID at the top of the hour identified both KDWB and WDGY, and Arbitron listed them as KDWB/WDGY.)https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1992/RR-1992-09-18.pdf WDGY switched to an adult standards format in March 1993, which gave it a respectable boost in ratings. As Midcontinent Media, then owner of KDWB, was looking to sell WDGY, the owner of WMIN, Borgen Broadcasting, agreed to lease the station through a local marketing agreement (LMA). This did not last long, as Midcontinent decided to sell the property in Woodbury that was home to the station's six-tower array. Hence, on April 18, 1994, with no transmission facility available and demand for AM radio low, 630 kHz went dark. The site then became the State Farm Insurance Companies regional headquarters. Borgen bought the silent WDGY in October 1996 and returned the station to the air in January 1997 as a Hudson, Wisconsin-based entity with the same call letters, airing a talk radio format that featured hosts like Don Imus, G. Gordon Liddy and Don and Mike, with oldies music from 6 PM to 6 AM. In February 1998, syndicated sports talk replaced oldies during those hours. =Radio Rey= A group of local Hispanic broadcasters had leased weekend time on WMIN for several years as \\"Radio Rey.\\" On January 1, 1999, WMIN went full-time Radio Rey, broadcasting from studios in a grocery store on the west side of St. Paul. Radio Rey flipped back and forth between WMIN and WDGY for several years before finally settling on WDGY in July 2001. For most of 2005, WMIN ran a complementary Regional Mexican format, \\"La Nueva Ley,\\" also programmed by the Radio Rey group. WDGY eventually secured a transmitter site closer to the heart of the metro area, which allowed it to boost its power and change its city of license back to St. Paul by the end of 2005. In 2018, the station rebranded slightly to \\"El Rey 94.9.\\" =Call letter change to WREY= In August 2008, the WDGY call letters were changed to WREY. Subsequently, sister station WMIN, a True Oldies Channel affiliate at 740 AM, changed its call letters to WDGY.

In his political career, Baker served in the U.S. House of Representatives from Illinois and later as a U.S. Senator from Oregon. He was also known as an orator and poet. A long-time close friend of the President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, Baker served as U.S. Army colonel during both the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the American Civil War. Baker was killed in the Battle of Ball's Bluff while leading a Union Army regiment, becoming the only sitting U.S. senator ever to be killed in a military engagement. Early life and education Edward Baker in 1850 as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives Born in London in 1811 to schoolteacher Edward Baker and Lucy Dickinson Baker, poor but educated Quakers, the boy Edward Baker and his family left England and emigrated to the United States in 1816, arriving in Philadelphia, where Baker's father established a school. Ed attended his father's school before quitting to apprentice as a loom operator in a weaving factory. In 1825, the family left Philadelphia and traveled to New Harmony, Indiana, a utopian community on the Ohio River led by Robert Owen and sought to follow communitarian ideals. The family left New Harmony in 1826 and moved to Belleville in Illinois Territory, a town near St. Louis. Baker and his father bought a horse and cart and started a drayage business that young Ned operated in St. Louis. Baker met Governor Ninian Edwards, who allowed Baker access to his private law library. Later he moved to Carrollton, Illinois, where he was admitted to the bar in 1830. =Marriage= On April 27, 1831, Baker married Mary Ann Foss; they would have five children together.Samuel (?‚Äì1852), Caroline C. (?‚Äì?), Lucy (?‚Äì?), Alfred W. (?‚Äì1898), and Edward Dickinson Jr. (?‚Äì1883) Illinois lawyer Edward Dickinson Baker Shortly after his marriage, Baker affiliated with the Disciples of Christ and engaged in part-time preaching, which as a by-product served to spread awareness of his skill in public oratory, an activity that eventually made him famous. A year after his marriage, Baker participated in the Black Hawk War but did not engage in hostilities. Around 1835, he became acquainted with Abraham Lincoln and soon became involved in local politics, being elected to the Illinois House of Representatives on July 1, 1837, and serving on the Illinois Senate from 1840 to 1844. In 1844, while living in Springfield, he defeated Lincoln for the nomination for the 7th U.S. congressional seat and was elected as a Whig. Baker and Lincoln became fast friends, an association which lent credibility to a claim that Baker baptized Lincoln. However, this claim is denied as apocryphal by later leaders of the Restoration Movement with which Baker's church of Christ was associated. In September 1844, Baker exhibited impetuous bravado in an incident arising out of the murder of Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, by a mob in a jail near Nauvoo, Illinois. As a colonel in the local militia, Baker was part of a group pursuing the mob leaders, who had fled across the Mississippi River into Missouri. Rather than wait for others to join him, Baker crossed the river and apprehended the fugitives. Baker served in Congress from March 4, 1845, until his resignation on December 24, 1846, to take effect on January 15, 1847. He resigned in a dispute over the legality of his serving in Congress and the army. The controversy arose from Article I, Section 6, of the U.S. Constitution, the so-called Incompatibility Clause, which prohibits an \\"officer of the United States\\" serving in either house of Congress. The two remained close friends, however, with Lincoln naming one of his sons Edward Baker Lincoln, affectionately called \\"Eddie.\\" Lincoln and Baker occasionally competed in Fives, a form of handball. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Baker briefly dropped out of politics and was commissioned as a colonel of the Fourth Regiment of the Illinois Volunteer Infantry, on July 4, 1846. In the Battle of Cerro Gordo, the regiment was assigned to General James Shields's Illinois brigade in General David E. Twiggs‚Äôs division. When Shields was badly wounded in an artillery barrage, Baker boldly led the brigade against the entrenched artillery battery, resulting in the capture of the guns. General Winfield Scott later said, \\"The brigade so gallantly led by General Shields, and, after his fall, by Colonel Baker, deserves high commendation for its fine behavior and success.\\" Soon after Cerro Gordo, the enlistment period ended for men of the 4th Illinois and they returned to New Orleans and were discharged on May 25. Baker returned to Springfield in 1848, but, rather than run against Lincoln again for nomination to Congress, Baker moved to Galena, where he was nominated and elected as a Whig to the 31st Congress (March 4, 1849 ‚Äì March 4, 1851). He was not a candidate for renomination in 1850. In July 1850, he proposed to the Panama Railroad Company that he recruit men to help build the railroad. Baker agreed to pay their expenses from St. Louis and in Panama, and the company would send them on to San Francisco by May 1. He became ill in Panama with a tropical disease and had to return to the U.S. Military service Commissioned on July 4, 1846, as Colonel of the Fourth Regiment, Illinois Volunteer Infantry, he participated with his regiment in the Siege of Vera Cruz, and also commanded one of the brigades involved in the Battle of Cerro Gordo. He continued to serve with his regiment until he was honorably mustered out on May 29, 1847. After his honorable discharge, he engaged in a 14-year break from military service, during which he served in the Thirty-first U.S. Congress from 1849 to 1851, relocated to San Francisco, where he practiced law and, in 1860, relocated to Oregon, where he was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate to fill a vacancy in the term beginning March 4, 1859.\\"Baker, Edward Dickinson\\", in \\"Biograpical Directory of the United States Congress.\\" Washington, D.C.: United States Congress, retrieved online August 10, 2018.Blair, Harry, and Tarshis, Rebecca.

In response to President Abraham Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers to help defend the nation's capital following the fall of Fort Sumter to Confederate forces in mid-April 1861, he raised a regiment at the dawn of the American Civil War, recruiting soldiers from New York City and Philadelphia. Offered a commission as brigadier-general of volunteers on May 17, 1861, he declined the honor, opting instead to serve as the colonel of the Seventy-first Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry and major-general of volunteers 1861; however, his tenure was short-lived. On October 21, 1861, he was killed in the Battle of Balls Bluff, Virginia. His remains were subsequently returned to California, and laid to rest at the San Francisco National Cemetery.\\"Baker, Edward Dickinson\\", United States Congress.Blair, Harry and Tarshis, Rebecca. Colonel Edward D. Baker: Lincoln‚Äôs Constant Ally.Braden, Gayle Anderson. \\"The Public Career of Edward Dickinson Baker.\\" California politician Baker (1811‚Äì1861) After Baker did not get a Cabinet position under President Zachary Taylor, he moved to San Francisco in 1852. He operated a successful law practice, despite what some described as sloppy business practices and inattention to detail, characterizations that had plagued him earlier: as a legislator, he was said to pay little attention to mundane details. Baker met Isaac J. Wistar, sixteen years Baker's junior and from a prominent Philadelphia family. He said Baker did not keep records and relied on his memory and a bundle of papers he carried around in his hat. Baker disdained preparing for legal cases and thought it was more effective to speak extemporaneously to a jury. Baker received substantial fees but spent the money as fast as it came in, Wistar said, and some of those expenditures paid faro debts. The two formed a successful partnership at Montgomery and Jackson Streets. California had been admitted to the United States in 1850 as a free state, but by the later part of the 1850s, the state was being pulled in different directions over the issue of slavery, and Baker became a leader in the movement to keep California in the Union. In 1855, he ran for a seat in the state senate as a Whig on the Free Soil Party party ticket but lost because the Whig party had collapsed. It was in those days that Baker adopted the name \\"Gray Eagle\\" from a poem by John Neal because of his gray hair (though he was balding). He was just under six feet tall. Baker became involved in a notorious criminal case in 1855 that threatened his legal and political future. He took up a job offered by Belle Cora who hired and paid Baker to defend her husband, Charles Cora, a well-known gambler accused of killing a United States marshal. The jury failed to reach a verdict, and Cora was lynched by a vigilante mob. The experience led Baker to become active in the Law and Order Party, which opposed actions of the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance, which took the law into its own hands. Because of the committee's criticism of his actions, Baker temporarily left the city and spent some time in the Sacramento area. Oregon politician Frustrated by his failure to win a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1859, Baker looked to greener political pastures to the north. Oregon held special interest for people who had once lived in Illinois, including men he had known in Springfield. He had become interested in Oregon politics in 1857, when Dr. Anson Henry, a friend from Springfield who had moved to Oregon, told Baker he could win the Senate election there. After statehood was achieved on February 14, 1859, Oregon Republicans asked Baker to come to their state to run for the Senate and counter the Democratic strength there. By the end of February 1860, the Baker family had moved into a house in Salem on what is now the campus of Willamette University. Baker opened a law office and started campaigning for Republicans around the state. In Salem on July 4, he acknowledged the rumbles of secession threats and proclaimed his willingness to die for his country: \\"If it be reserved for me to lay my unworthy life upon the altar of my country in defending it from internal assailants, I declare here today that I aspire to no higher glory than that the sun of my life may go down beneath the shadow of freedom's temple and baptize the emblem of the nation‚Äôs greatness, the Stars and Stripes, that float so proudly before us today, in my heart‚Äôs warmest blood.\\" The Oregon legislature met in Salem in September 1860 to elect two men to the Senate. In an effort to keep Baker from receiving the required majority of 26 votes, six proslavery senators left the meeting and hid in a barn to prevent a quorum. They were brought back, and the legislators reached a compromise on October 7 and elected James Nesmith, a Douglas Democrat, and Baker. The Douglas Democrats supported Baker because of his sincerity and support of popular sovereignty. U.S. Senator Baker in American Civil War Baker took his seat in the Senate on December 5, 1860. His Oregon colleague, Senator Joseph Lane, disliked him so much that he refused to follow tradition and introduce Baker to the Senate, so Democratic senator Milton Latham of California did it. On December 31, Senator Judah Benjamin of Louisiana argued that Southern states had a constitutional right to secede and that other states would soon join South Carolina, which had seceded on December 20. Baker refuted Benjamin's argument in a three-hour speech a day later. He acknowledged that he was opposed to interference with slave owners in slave states, but he was also opposed to secession and the extension of slavery into new territories and states. In March 1861, he indicated a willingness to compromise on some issues to prevent the breakup of the country. =Lincoln inauguration= Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated on March 4, 1861. Baker and Senator James A. Pearce of Maryland faced backward in the presidential carriage as they rode from the White House to the Capitol, and Lincoln and outgoing president James Buchanan faced forward. On horseback at the head of their cavalry escort was the man who would figure prominently as Baker's commander at the Battle of Ball's Bluff. Colonel Charles P. Stone was an up- and-coming Union officer who was responsible for security in Washington for the inauguration. Stone spurred his horse to excite other horses in the escort party because he believed the prancing horses would form a better protective barrier and protect the dignitaries in the carriage. Baker introduced Lincoln to the audience gathered on the east portico of the Capitol: \\"Fellow citizens, I introduce to you, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.\\" Lincoln did not name Baker to his cabinet because his support in the Senate was so critical. If Baker had resigned his Senate seat, Oregon's pro-slavery Democratic governor, John Whiteaker, would have appointed a pro-slavery Democrat to take his place. Death in battle Colonel Edward D. Baker at the Battle of Ball's Bluff, October 21, 1861 The Civil War began April 12 when Confederate artillery fired on Fort Sumter, and three days later, President Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers. Baker left the Senate to go to New York City, where he spoke for two hours to a crowd of 100,000 in Union Square on April 19. He was blunt: \\"The hour for conciliation is past; the gathering for battle is at hand, and the country requires that every man shall do his duty.\\" He affirmed his own willingness to take up arms: \\"If Providence shall will it, this feeble hand shall draw a sword, never yet dishonored, not to fight for honor on a foreign field, but for country, for home, for law, for government, for Constitution, for right, for freedom, for humanity.\\" The following day, he met with 200 men from California who wanted to form a regiment that would symbolize the commitment of the West Coast to the Union cause. On May 8, Baker was authorized by Secretary of War Simon Cameron to form the California Regiment with him as its commanding officer with the rank of colonel. Baker telegraphed Isaac J. Wistar, his San Francisco law partner, who was back in Philadelphia, and asked him to help recruit and organize the regiment. When Wistar asked about rank, Baker replied, \\"I cannot at this moment accept military rank without jeopardizing my seat in the Senate. But you know my relations with Lincoln, and if you do that for me, I can assure you that within six months I shall be a Major-General and you shall have a Brigadier- General's commission and a satisfactory command under me.\\" Baker wrote to Lincoln on June 11, asking that he be given a command that would \\"not make him second to everybody.\\" His efforts paid off; on July 31, Lincoln sent the Senate names of men he was recommending for appointments as brigadier generals. On the list, besides Charles Stone, Ulysses Grant and others, was Edward Baker. He told the Senate he would refuse the commission because of its doubtful legality. He said he was pleased that the government would allow him a command with his rank of colonel, \\"quite sufficient for all my military aspirations,\\" which indicates he believed he could be a colonel and remain in the Senate. He wrote to Lincoln on August 31 to decline the appointment as brigadier general, citing the problem of incompatibility and implying that he had the government's permission to hold a colonel's commission. To add to the mystery, the War Department notified Baker on September 21 that Lincoln had appointed him to be a major general. A list of Civil War generals based on official records indicates Baker held the rank of major general. However, the U.S. Senate states that he was a colonel. He was assigned command of a brigade in Stone's division, guarding fords along the Potomac River north of Washington. At a dinner with Journalist George Wilkes in August, Baker predicted he would die in an early battle of the war: \\"I am certain I shall not live through this war, and if my troops should show any want of resolution, I shall fall in the first battle. I cannot afford, after my career in Mexico, and as a Senator of the United States, to turn my face from the enemy.\\" Baker stopped at the White House on October 20 to visit his old friend. Lincoln sat against a tree on the northeast White House lawn, while Baker lay on the ground with his hands behind his head. Willie Lincoln played in the leaves while the two men talked. Baker picked Willie up and kissed him before shaking the President's hand as he left. Mary Lincoln gave Baker a bouquet of flowers, which he accepted graciously and sadly: \\"Very beautiful. These flowers and my memory will wither together.\\" On October 21, a false report of an unguarded Confederate camp at Ball's Bluff encouraged Brig. Gen. Charles Pomeroy Stone to order a raid, which clashed with enemy forces. Baker tried to reinforce the Union troops, but failed to ensure that there were enough boats for the river crossings, which were then delayed. At around four o‚Äôclock, Baker was struck by a volley of bullets through his heart and brain that killed him instantly. Wistar said that he and Baker had a brief discussion just prior to his being killed, and Baker said, \\"The officer who dies with his men will never be harshly judged.\\" President Lincoln was at General George McClellan's headquarters that evening when he got the news of Baker's death. Charles Carleton Coffin of the Boston Journal saw Lincoln crying when he received the news of Baker's death: \\"With bowed head, and tears rolling down his furrowed cheeks, his face pale and wan, his heart heaving with emotion, he almost fell as he stepped into the street.\\" At Baker's funeral, Mary Todd Lincoln scandalized Washington by appearing in a lilac ensemble, including matching gloves and hat, rather than the traditional black. Despite Baker's close friendship with her husband, she retorted, \\"I wonder if the women of Washington expect me to muffle myself in mourning for every soldier killed in this great war?\\" After subsequent funerals in Philadelphia and New York City, Baker's body was sent by the steamer Northern Light and the Panama Railroad to San Francisco for burial. He is buried in Section OSD, Site 488, San Francisco National Cemetery. Of himself, Baker once said, \\"my real forte is my power to command, to rule and lead men. I feel that I could lead men anywhere.\\" Baker's friends, however, thought his true talent lay in his gift of oratory. Baker depicted on the Series 1875 $5000 Certificate of Deposit Baker's statue His death shocked official Washington and led to the formation of the Congressional Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War.

Substantial transformation of Fort Qu'Appelle occurred when farm development began in the 1880s and farmers required a nearby urban centre for selling their grain and other products, purchasing agricultural and domestic supplies and for social gathering beyond rural schools and churches. It was not anticipated that initial partition of agricultural land into farms of one-quarter section (160 acres) would not last long and farm population would substantially reduce very quickly; the process accelerated in the 1970s when farmers began selling their land and retiring in substantial numbers to Fort Qu'Appelle and the custom of elderly farmers remaining at home with offspring past into history, with more retiring to town.

CANADIAN PLAINS RESEARCH CENTER, UNIVERSITY OF REGINA. Retrieved 2012-7-10 This coincided with the first development of British India after the seizing of control of India from the East India Company by the Crown after the 1857 Indian Mutiny, and the town of Fort Qu'Appelle's striking similarity to the Indian hill stations of the early Raj has been widely commented upon by anyone who has seen both. Although the North-West Mounted Police headquarters was established in Regina once it was named capital of the North-West Territories in 1882, the substantial police station at the western end of the town of Fort Qu'Appelle remained significant as centre of service within the valley and in rural communities and to farms in the plains region: this became more important though less as nearby towns declined from the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929 and continuing after World War II. Older residences and commercial premises together with the town's Anglican and United (formerly Presbyterian) churches are quintessentially of the 19th century hinterland British Empire, a matter which local civic boosters and cultivators of tourism appear not yet to have capitalised upon. \\"In 1913, construction began on a fish culture station near Fort Qu‚ÄôAppelle and, to date, the facility has supplied more than 2 billion fish to stock water bodies throughout the province....[T]he Fort Qu‚ÄôAppelle Sanatorium (Fort San) for tuberculosis patients...[opened in] 1917.\\" Fort Hotel in the 1920s, destroyed by fire in the 1960s The ample commercial shops were substantially busier than merely for town residents, being grocery and supply centres for the ample number of farms; the Fort Hotel of the early 20th century through the 1960s had a well-attended pub with its parking lot full late Friday afternoons through evenings. A large drive-in movie theatre stood on Bay Avenue south of the railway track just before the entry into the coulee on Highway 36 to leave the valley; it had lively attendance by townspeople, cottagers and farmers until the 1960s when home television significantly improved and the drive-in closed. Despite the accelerating decline of rural Saskatchewanian population in the post-World War II years as farms needed to be larger and therefore fewer in number for economic viability, the town grew through most of the 1950s and 1960s as a cottage community serving the Qu'Appelle Lakes summer-cottage country in the valley up- and down-river from the town. Cottagers from Regina and other southern Saskatchewan communities used Fort Qu'Appelle as a base from which to explore the scenic and historic river valley, purchase hardware and groceries and contract services; the town also benefited urban drift as farms and other towns steadily depopulated. Highway 35 between Qu'Appelle and Fort Qu'Appelle This process was precipitately accelerated in the early 1960s. Highway 35 had reached Fort Qu'Appelle by branching off the Trans-Canada Highway at the once-significant town Qu'Appelle and somewhat laboriously proceeding into the Qu'Appelle Valley by winding through an un-occupied coulee. The old highway was supplemented and effectively replaced by Highway 10, leaving the Trans-Canada at Balgonie and taking a straight route from the plain into the valley. This vastly eased access from the southwest and increased Fort Qu'Appelle's attraction over other market-places for farmers. 19th-century country school building elsewhere shown while still in use; here photographed in 1970, seven years after closure of successor across the road, from site of teacher's residence: demonstrating steady depopulation of farm neighbourhoods. In 1963, with steadily decreasing density of farm neighbourhood populations and increasing quality of highways, the rural school districts were abolished and farm primary and high school children‚Äîtaught in one building with one or two classrooms‚Äîwere thereafter bused to town schools. Rural churches having largely closed in the 1950s, the collapse of rural farming communities was now assured, to the benefit of minor metro-poles such as Fort Qu'Appelle though arguably to the impoverishment of the community as a whole. With the building of Highway 10 making access to Fort Qu'Appelle from outside the valley easier and faster, the process of farmers using it rather than previously substantial towns such as Qu'Appelle, Edgeley and Balcarres for selling grain and buying groceries further increased its size and vitality. The town itself is today \\"a shopping, service, and institutional centre serving the surrounding [f]arming community, neighbouring resort villages, cottagers and summer vacationers.\\" David McLennan. \\"Fort Qu'Appelle.\\" The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan.

He founded the Saskatchewan Anti- Tuberculosis League which incorporated and constructed the Fort Qu'Appelle sanitarium. This tuberculosis sanatorium was operated by the provincial department of public health under the direction of Dr. R.G. Ferguson and opened in 1917 at nearby Fort San; when tuberculosis ceased to be a public health problem the facility was turned into a fine arts complex where a substantial summer program was operated 1967-91 when the provincial government terminated its funding: latterly it has become a resort village housing the Echo Valley Conference Centre. In addition to the ample summer lake cottages‚Äîin later years many occupied throughout the year‚Äîand the successive uses of the former Fort San tuberculosis, for many years the Regina YMCA operated a summer camp on the north shore of Echo Lake just west of Fort San; the Anglican Church continues to maintain a similar summer camp on the south shore of Mission Lake the other, east side of the town.

The former Central School, built in 1911, was converted to the Qu'Appelle Valley Centre for the Arts. Parklands College is located at the Treaty 4 Governance Centre. Schooling in Fort Qu'Appelle radically expanded immediately after the end of academic year 1962-63 when close by rural schools, which had pupils from kindergarten to grade 12, universally closed and their attendees were thereafter driven for school to the Fort. Such element in school pupils and students vastly diminished in subsequent decades, however, as farm population steadily declined. From 1967 through 1991 the closed tuberculosis sanatorium at Fort San was the location of the Saskatchewan Summer School of the Arts covering dance, music, visual art, writing and theatre. This drew a great many summer visitors to Fort San but also Fort Qu'Appelle and Lebret, whose Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church was site for liturgical music presentations; the School of the Arts closed due to elimination of provincial government funding.Qu'Appelle - Stories From the San  Places of worship  Pre-World War I photo of St Andrew's Presbyterian (United since 1925) Church with next- door manse on Bay Avenue, immediately across side-street from St. John the Evangelist Anglican, also on Bay Avenue.

Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church, Lebret This perhaps especially noticeably affects traditionally dominant denominations among the area's farm communities of Roman Catholic, Presbyterian (cum-United Church in Fort Qu'Appelle albeit not universally in neighbouring Qu'Appelle and Indian Head) and Methodist (universally cum-United in 1925 hereabouts.) But the historic church buildings are nonetheless supplemented latterly by the more recently constructed Our Lady of Sorrows Roman Catholic Church, Our Saviour Lutheran Church, and the more recently arrived denominations' Valley Alliance Church and Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witness. Once-thriving rural United Churches survived until the 1950s but closed when farmers' regular access to town increased and more fundamentalist at-home meetings acquired some favour.

The work is also considered one of the earliest written examples of Assamese. A particular feature of this work is the non-heroic portrayal of Rama, Sita, and other characters, as explicitly stated by Madhav Kandali himself, which rendered the work unsuitable for religious purposes. This feature disturbed a later poet, Ananta Kandali, who was moved enough to comment on it. The first (Adikanda) and last (Uttarakanda) cantos of Madhava Kandali's work were lost, and were later inserted by Madhavdeva and Sankardeva respectively in the 16th century. The poem has been translated into English. The Ramayana The Ramayana was written upon the request of the Boraha king Mahamanikya (Mahamanikpha, 1411‚Äì1436). \\"Maha Manik reign period\\", Historyfiles.co.uk, London At that time, his kingdom centered on central Assam Kandali writes: > kavirƒÅj kandali ye ƒÅmƒÅkese buliwƒÅyƒÅ > kariloho sarvajana bodhe. > ramayana supa yara, shri mahamanike ye, > baraha rajar anurudhe. > sat kanda ramayana padabandhe nibandhilo > lambha parihari sarodhrite. > mahamanikyoro bolo kavyarasa kicho dilon > dugdhak mathilo yena ghrite > pandit lokar yebe asantosa upajaya > hat yore bolon shudha bak > pustak bichari yebe taite katha napawaha > tebe sabe nindiba amak. The poetic work uses various metres for different moods and situations. Some of the metres used are pada (fourteen syllables, four lines of verses), jhumura (four lines, with eight syllables each), dulari (three charana, first and second has six syllables each and the third has eight syllables), and chhavi (like dulari, but with different syllabilic structure). The pada metre became very popular in later Assamese compositions. Kandali adapted his work according to the taste of the common folk, in order to make it more popular. He portrays Rama and Sita as human characters, with astonishing qualities but with some human weaknesses in certain situations. The original work was based on a vision that the Boraha king was reported to have experienced, of a naked man riding an upturned bowl full of milk. Later additions and influences The adi kanda (Book 1) and the uttara kanda (Book 7) were lost by the 15th century, so they were later added by Madhavdev and Srimanta Sankardeva respectively. Sankardeva writes of Kandali: > purvakavi apramadi madhav kandali adi > pade virachila rama katha > hastira dekhiya lada sasa yena phure marga > mora bhaila tenhaya avastha. Some other additions were made by Ananta Kandali (16th century) and others. This work has cast a strong influence on Sankardeva, and also later Assamese works. A later Karbi Ramayana was also influenced by this work.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 17, 1995. In the episode, Marge refuses to buy Bart the new video game Bonestorm, so he steals it from a local discount store. Bart is estranged from his mother after he gets caught, so he works to regain her love and trust. The episode was written by Mike Scully and directed by Steven Dean Moore. Scully got the inspiration for it from an experience in his childhood when he shoplifted. Lawrence Tierney guest-starred in the episode as Don Brodka. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 9.5, and was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. Plot Bart wants the new video game Bonestorm, but Marge refuses to buy it because it is too violent and expensive. Unable to rent it or play Milhouse's copy, Bart visits the local Try-N-Save discount store, where Jimbo Jones and Nelson Muntz convince him to steal a copy. Bart is caught by security guard Don Brodka, who orders him to leave the store and never return. Unaware of Bart's crime, Marge takes the family to the same store to get their annual Christmas picture taken. Bart is spotted by Brodka, who shows a disbelieving Marge and Homer the security tape of their son shoplifting. Bart tries to apologize to Marge, but she rebuffs him and sends him to bed. Concerned she may be mothering Bart too much, Marge decides he is old enough to make his own decisions and emotionally distances herself from him. Bart is soon left out of family activities, such as making snow statues and decorating the Christmas tree. Worried he has lost Marge's love, Bart convinces Milhouse's mother, Luann, to spend time with him. To regain his mother's love, Bart shops at Try-N-Save and returns home with a bulge in his coat. Thinking he has shoplifted again, Marge confronts Bart, who reveals he bought a Christmas present for her: a photo of himself. Overjoyed at getting this early Christmas gift, Marge gives Bart his present: the golf simulator video game Lee Carvallo's Putting Challenge. Though underwhelmed, Bart thanks her and they reconcile. Production alt=A man with sunglasses smiles as he signs autographs. Mike Scully, the writer of the episode, based it on an experience in his childhood. Scully was twelve years old when he paid a visit to the Bradlees discount department store in West Springfield, Massachusetts. A \\"bunch of guys\\" were shoplifting at the store and they \\"pressured\\" Scully into shoplifting as well. He ended up getting caught outside, and \\"had one of the most traumatic moments\\" of his life. \\"To this day it still terrifies me\\", Scully said. He jokingly told Variety, \\"It's great to be paid for reliving the horrors of your life.\\" The episode was directed by Steven Dean Moore. The show runner of The Simpsons at the time, Bill Oakley, thinks this is one of the most \\"beautifully\\" directed episodes of the show. He called the \\"hand-colouring\\" very \\"vivid\\" and \\"bright\\". The episode is the first Christmas episode the producers had done since the first episode of the series, \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\". Oakley said that nobody in the writing staff wanted to \\"try on Christmas\\" because it was \\"so famous\\" as being the first episode. Lawrence Tierney guest-starred in the episode as Don Brodka. Another former show runner, Josh Weinstein, called Tierney's appearance \\"the craziest guest star experience we ever had\\". In addition to yelling at and intimidating employees of the show, Tierney made requests they considered unreasonable, such as abandoning his distinctive voice to do the part in a southern accent and refusing to perform lines if he did not \\"get the jokes\\". Despite this, Oakley and Weinstein thought Tierney did a good job. Weinstein said, \\"He certainly delivered and he's one of my favorite characters we have had [on the show].\\" After Tierney's death, the episode \\"The Old Man and the Key\\" was dedicated to him. \\"Marge Be Not Proud\\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 17, 1995.. The episode was selected for release in a 1999 video collection of selected episodes, titled: Bart Wars. Other episodes included in the collection set were \\"Mayored to the Mob\\", \\"Dog of Death\\", and \\"The Secret War of Lisa Simpson\\". The episode was again included in the 2005 DVD release of the Bart Wars set. The episode was included in The Simpsons season seven DVD set, which was released on December 13, 2005. Oakley, Weinstein, Scully, Moore, and Silverman participated in the DVD's audio commentary.

The episode was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following a boxing match, Fox NFL Sunday, and The X-Files. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: \\"A Christmas special in all but name, and a touching look at the relationship between Marge and her growing Bart.\\" Dave Foster of DVD Times said that \\"thanks to the keen eye of the writers and the rarely shown good side of Bart, this episode works very well as both an amusing insight to the way a child‚Äôs mind works and as a strong relationship building episode between Bart and Marge.\\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that despite being one of the \\"sappier\\" episodes at times, it \\"still packs some terrific laughs\\". Jacobson commented that he \\"absolutely lost it when Homer‚Äôs drawing of a robot grilling a hot dog was seen ‚Äì it‚Äôs funnier if you see it ‚Äì and Lawrence Tierney‚Äôs guest turn as the store detective adds hilarious grit to the show.\\" He added that the episode does not \\"fall into the classic\\" category, \\"but it offers more than enough entertainment to satisfy\\". Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when a depressed Bart makes a snowman from the dirty, leftover snow under the car. She called the scene \\"amazingly pathetic\\". Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B. In 2011, Richard Lawson of The Atlantic Wire cited it as the best Christmas episode of The Simpsons, noting that \\"it's very sweet and there are some funny videogame jokes\\".

A villain of the week is commonly seen in American and Japanese genre-based television series. As many shows of this type air episodes weekly at a rate of ten to twenty new episodes per year, there is often a new antagonist in the plot of each week's episode. The main characters usually confront and vanquish these characters, often leaving them never to be seen again (as in Charmed, Smallville, and Scooby-Doo). Some series alternate between using such antagonists and furthering the series' ongoing plotlines (as in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Supernatural, Fringe, and The X-Files, where fandom is often divided over preference for one type of episode versus the other), while others use these one-time foes as pawns of the recurring adversaries (as in Kamen Rider and Sailor Moon, as well as in Super Sentai and its American equivalent, Power Rangers). On other occasions, these villains return reformed, becoming invaluable allies or gaining a larger role in the story. The American action drama Burn Notice focuses on short- lived antagonists, but the final portion of every episode is committed to developing a larger story arc. The British sci-fi programme Torchwood used this format in its first two series, before switching to a continuous story format. \\"Villain of the week\\" plotlines are attractive to syndicators, as it means that episodes can be rerun in any order and do not need to be aired in sequence as serials with continuing storylines do.

Richard Bath writes of him that he was: :\\"A solid scrummager, he was a superb minder at the line-out and surprisingly for a prop, was well known as a great cover tackler.\\" Allan Massie says that he was: :\\"...undoubtedly the fastest prop to have played for Scotland in modern times. He covered and tackled like a back- row forward: two notable try-saving tackles came in that heroic Scots win in Paris in 1969. He was powerful and very hard to stop with the ball in his hands, extremely formidable in a peel from the line-out. Some critics felt that he was insufficiently assertive, but his side gained on balance from his concentration on ball and game, and his disinclination to be drawn into private battles.... His speed in the loose was made him seem more like a French forward than a British one, and it would have been a joy seeing him playing in a French-style pack.\\"Massie, pp 169-171 Stephen Watt writes: Carmichael was an outstanding rugby player from an early age. His versatility as a prop was because he played at No. 8 for his school team (Loretto School, Musselburgh) where he was an early exponent of the \\"pick up and go\\" move from the base of the scrum. Carmichael was part of the West of Scotland team in the 1970s - a powerhouse in UK rugby, averaging 10 internationalists in the team per season, and dominating the domestic league with West's great rivals, Hawick RFC. Carmichael charged down a drop out and returned for a score in a memorable 32-6 victory against Hawick to win the league in 1973. Massie also says that for a prop, he was very versatile, and that in many ways, he presaged the move away from positional specialisation into a more diversified game. He is the grandson of Alec Bennett who played football for Celtic, Rangers and Scotland in the early 20th century. The Canterbury Incident Carmichael is mainly remembered for being the victim of violence in the 1971 tour where he received five fractures of the cheekbone, yet still played until final whistle. The match was described as an extremely violent match and often referred to as the Battle of Canterbury.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby- union/2017/06/10/battle-canterbury-1971-truth-behind-dirtiest-match-lions- history/ The referee at one point told the captains that from that moment onwards he was going to follow the ball and it was up to them to sort out anything else. Expected to be the first choice tighthead prop for the test team, Carmichael was forced to leave the tour following the Canterbury game. His place in the test team was taken by Irishman Sean Lynch. Carmichael also went on the 1974 tour to South Africa, but did not make the test side. He was awarded an MBE in the 1977 Silver Jubilee and Birthday Honours. References * Bath, Richard (ed.)

Biography Evans was born in Marion, South Carolina, the third son of Thomas and Jane Beverly (n√©e Daniel) Evans. He briefly attended Randolph-Macon College before receiving an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point from John C. Calhoun. He graduated as 36th out of 38 graduates in 1848, was brevetted 2nd Lieutenant and sent to the western frontier to serve in the 1st U.S. Dragoons. In late 1849 he finally received his commission and was transferred to the 2nd U.S. Dragoons. He became an experienced Indian fighter with his unit; the later being renamed to 2nd U.S. Cavalry Regiment in 1855, led by A. S. Johnston and Robert E. Lee. Evans was promoted to 1st Lieutenant in 1855 and to Captain in 1856, staying in the west for the next years. On February 27, 1861, Evans resigned from the army and offered his services to his home state; shortly afterwards entering Confederate service. He was made a Colonel in July and commanded a small brigade at the First Battle of Bull Run, where he was the first Confederate field commander to perceive the Union intent to attack the Confederate left flank at dawn. His command went far toward saving the day for the South. During the thick of the fight, he was everywhere, closely followed by an aide carrying his \\"barrelito\\" (small barrel) of Evans' favorite whiskey on his back. A number of examples of Evans' good tactical leadership and bravery in battle are recorded. However, his abrasive personality and his passion for intoxicating beverages led to his constant difficulties with colleagues and superiors. He was given command of a brigade of Mississippi and Virginia troops and assigned to guard the upper fords of the Potomac River, above Washington, D.C.. In October 1861, a Union force crossed the river near Leesburg, Virginia, and at the Battle of Ball's Bluff Evans' command drove the enemy into the Potomac River, inflicting great loss. Evans was promoted to brigadier general to be effective from the day of the battle. He was then sent to assist in defending the coastal areas just south of Charleston. He was placed in command of the First Military District which included the village of Secessionville, just two days before the battle there, but played little part in it. He also commanded Confederate forces in the Engagements at Pineberry, Willtown, and White Point. In July 1862, he was given command of a newly formed brigade of South Carolina troops and led it to Richmond to join Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Evans' Brigade participated in the battles of Second Manassas, South Mountain and Antietam in 1862 and was then assigned to Eastern North Carolina to oppose a major Union raid on Kinston and Goldsboro. After this campaign, he was tried and acquitted for drunkenness during the Battle of Kinston. At Second Bull Run, Evans' brigade was attached to Brig. Gen John B. Hood's division, and since Evans ranked Hood, had authority over him for the campaign. The two generals got into an argument after the battle and Evans had Hood arrested, but Lee ordered him to release Hood and restore him to command. At Antietam, Evans commanded a demi-division consisting of his own and Col. George T. Anderson's brigades. In the summer of 1863, Evans' brigade was assigned to General Joseph E. Johnston's army during the Vicksburg Campaign. After this campaign, the brigade returned to Charleston where Evans quarreled with his superior, General Roswell S. Ripley, who had him tried for disobedience of orders. Following Evans' acquittal, General P.G.T. Beauregard still considered Evans incompetent and would not return him to command. He was finally reinstated to command in the spring of 1864, but was severely injured in a buggy accident in Charleston as he was preparing to take his brigade north to the Petersburg Campaign. Evans' Brigade, renamed for its new commander, Brigadier General Stephen Elliott, Jr., would soon find itself in the Petersburg trenches directly above the Union mine and suffer heavy casualties at the Battle of the Crater. Although Evans recovered somewhat from his injury, he was never returned to command. He held a lesser position at the War Department for a time and fled Richmond with President Jefferson Davis. Evans' brother-in-law, Brigadier General Martin Witherspoon Gary, joined Davis' party at Greensboro and they both accompanied the president until he spent the night of May 1, 1865, at the Gary family home in Cokesbury, South Carolina. After the war, Evans became a high school principal in Cokesbury and then in Midway, Alabama, where he died in 1868, probably from the effects of his previous Charleston accident. He was buried in Tabernacle Cemetery in Cokesbury. General William Henry Fitzhugh Lee, son of Robert E. Lee, once wrote of Evans: > \\"Shanks\\" Evans, as he was so called, was a graduate of the military academy, > a native South Carolinian, served in the respected old Second Dragoons, and > was a good example of the rip-roaring, scorn all-care element which so > largely abounded in that regiment. Evans had the honor of opening the fight > (First Manassas), we might say fired the first gun of the war.

Organized under the leadership of Captain Martin Linge, it soon became a pool of talent for a variety of special operations in Norway. History Kompani Linge Memorial, Glenmore Forest Park in Scotland The original English-language administrative title did not have much resonance in Norwegian and they soon became better known as Kompani Linge (Linge's Company). Martin Linge's death early in the war came to enhance the title, which became formalised as Lingekompaniet in his honour. The members of the unit were trained at various locations in the United Kingdom, including at the SOE establishment at Drumintoul Lodge in the Cairngorms, Scotland. Their initial raids in 1941 were to Lofoten (Operation Claymore) and M√•l√∏y (Operation Archery), where Martin Linge was killed. Their best known raids were probably the Norwegian heavy water sabotage. Other raids included the Thamshavnbanen sabotage. In the capital area, the Oslogjengen carried out several sabotage missions. In cooperation with Milorg, the main Norwegian resistance organisation, communication lines with London were gradually improved during the war, so that by 1945, 64 radio operators were spread throughout Norway. According to Mitt liv, the autobiography of Max Manus (1995. N.W. Damm), the Linge Company was for a time counted amongst the most decorated military forces in the United Kingdom during World War II. The veterans from the company were also amongst the first to welcome King Haakon home. A total of 530 Norwegians served in NOR.I.C.1, of whom 57 lost their lives.

However, The Washington Star soon apologized for having printed the quotation without verifying its authenticity and, on February 18, 1958, published an article entitled \\"Story of a Phony Quotation-- A Futile Effort to Pin It Down--'A Racial Program for the 20th Century' Seems to Exist Only in Somebody's Imagination\\", which traced the quotation to Eustace Mullins, who claimed to have found it in a Zionist publication in the Library of Congress. On August 30 of that year, Rep. Abraham J. Multer of New York read the Star article into the Congressional Record and raised several other points challenging the quotation's authenticity. These included the nonexistence of a British Communist party in 1912 (it was founded in 1920) and the nonexistence of a British Communist author named Israel Cohen. Although a British Jewish author and Zionist named Israel Cohen did exist in that period, he had no affiliation with Communism nor is there any record of him writing such a work. A Racial Program does not exist either in the Library of Congress or in the British Museum Catalogue of Printed Books. Eustace Mullins also invented the fabricated speech Our Race Will Rule Undisputed Over The World under the alias of 'Israel Cohen'.

It was released for the Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, IBM PC compatibles, Apple II, and Commodore 64. A sequel, The Eternal Dagger, was released in 1987. Gameplay Academic Matt Barton describes Wizard's Crown as \\"probably the most hardcore RPG of its time\\" and \\"one of the most sophisticated tactical CRPGs ever designed\\". The object of the game is to rescue a magical crown from Tarmon, a wizard who sealed himself and the crown in his laboratory 500 years previous. The video game design and programming was done by Paul Murray and Keith Brors, game development by Chuck Kroegel and Jeff Johnson, and the rulebook created by Leona Billings. Wizard's Crown was the first RPG designed in-house by SSI, previously known as a wargame company. Its detailed tactical combat system came from Murray and Brors's background in wargaming, and they brought the complexity of those games to Wizard's Crowns tactical combat. For instance, shields block attacks only from the front and left (shielded) side, and not from the rear and right (unshielded side). Spears can attack two squares away, flails ignore the defender's shields, and axes have a chance of breaking shields. There is an option for \\"quick combat\\", and regular combat can take as long as 40 minutes per encounter. This combat system influenced SSI's later Gold Box series of RPGs, but it was streamlined and simplified. The class system is based on a point buy system, possibly influenced by the tabletop role-playing games RuneQuest and Traveller. Characters buy classes and skills using Intelligence points. The classes are thief, ranger, fighter, priest and sorcerer, each possessing a distinct set of skills. Characters can have any number of classes, but mixing classes slows advancement. Up to eight characters can be created in a single party. Experience is spent directly on skills, attributes and life points. When a skill level is very low, gains are quick and easy, but they become slow and difficult to raise after reaching high levels. The magic system works like other skills and features a chance of failure based on skill level. The game is also memorable for its magic weapons, for example, the Storm Longsword or Doom Battleaxe. There are three special series of weapons which can be enchanted to become progressively more powerful: * The 'Magic' series of weapons does pure magical damage (\\"injuries\\") and progresses under the names of 'Magic, Frost, Flaming, Lightning and Storm'. * The 'Plus' series of weapons cause extra bleeding, which would cause an opponent to pass out (\\"The opponent lies unmoving\\") but not die outright. For example, if all player characters pass out from excessive bleeding in a battle, you lose the battle, but are given a chance to heal them up in camp afterwards. These weapons are designated with \\"+1, +2, +3, +4, +5\\". * The 'Life Blast' series of weapons are the most powerful in the game. They do direct damage to life points, and a character who is taken out by these weapons is killed; you cannot revive them except with a resurrection spell. These weapons progress with the names 'Dark, Doom, Soul, Demon and Death'. Reception SSI sold 47,676 copies of Wizard's Crown in North America, and it was the company's second best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987. Compute! in 1986 favorably reviewed Wizard's Crown, describing it as \\"probably the most unusual fantasy game to hit the market in some time\\". Citing its graphics and detailed combat, the magazine stated that the game \\"that will excite and challenge even the most seasoned veteran of fantasy warfare\\". Computer Gaming Worlds Scorpia admired the game's use of injuries and bleeding in simulating combat, but believed there was too much emphasis on hack and slash, with only a few trivial puzzles and almost no interaction between the party and anyone else beyond buying, selling, and killing. In 1993 Scorpia was more positive, describing it as a \\"better-than- average hack'n'slash ... a good game for the bash'em crowd\\". A 1986 ANALOG Computing review called the Atari version \\"superb ... a true gem, an addictive game which you'll find yourself playing day in and day out\\". The game was reviewed in 1986 in Dragon #114 by Hartley and Pattie Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers \\"recommend this offering as one that truly presents a most positive view of fantasy role-playing as played on a computer system.\\" In a subsequent column, the reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. Antics review was mixed, stating that Wizard's Crown \\"throws in a few new tricks of its own\\" but \\"is mostly old wine in new bottles\\". The magazine concluded that \\"Wizard's Crown is okay. But I probably would have enjoyed it more if I felt that I was really controlling the characters‚Äînot just watching random-number generators at work.\\" References  External links  Wizard's Crown for the Atari 8-bit family at Atari Mania *Wizard's Crown for the Atari ST at Atari Mania Role-playing video games Apple II games Atari ST games Atari 8-bit family games Commodore 64 games DOS games Strategic Simulations games 1986 video games Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Wizard's Crown"},{"id":"1360936","text":"Dr. Zoraida Santiago (born May 25, 1952) is a composer and singer of Puerto Rican folkloric themes.

It was an important part of the pre-European contact trade routes of the Cree and Assiniboine peoples. Long before the fur trade with the Bay and during the Fur Trade, this location was used as a campsite and portage between Grassy River, at the head of a number of well-used routes from Hudson Bay, and Lake Athapapuskow, which connected to the Saskatchewan River system. Once on the Saskatchewan routes were open through the prairies to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. History Cha Chay Pay Way Ti's Map of the Waterways of a Part of Northern Manitoba (1806) The area has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Archaeological digs on Lake Athapapuskow revealed pottery, arrowheads, and other artifacts which were at least 2,500 years old and indicated regular habitation by the \\"Shield Archaic Culture\\", who hunted caribou in the area as far back as 7000 years ago. They were eventually supplanted by the Woodland Cree who were nomadic hunters in this region. The site of Cranberry Portage has been an important portage route linking the Grass River and Saskatchewan River watersheds for at least 2,000 years. The first European believed to have used that route and reach Lake Athapapuskow was the fur trader Joseph Smith in 1763. In 1774, the explorer Samuel Hearne paddled up the Grass River to Cranberry Portage and into Lake Athapapuskow en route to establishing Cumberland House. This route became an important part of the North American fur trade, known as the \\"Upper Tract\\". It was abandoned by 1800 in favour of the Nelson River and Hayes River routes. In 1806, explorer and surveyor Peter Fidler recorded the main waterways of his Cree partners in the notable \\"Cha Chay Pay Way Ti's Map of the Waterways of a Part of Northern Manitoba\\", Cranberry Portage is clearly marked on it. Cranberry Portage railway station circa 1910 In the early 20th century, rich gold, copper, and zinc deposits were discovered nearby in what would soon become the area of Flin Flon, Manitoba. Mining development in the area fueled a great deal of local infrastructure development, beginning with the extension of the rail line and Highway 10 from The Pas, Manitoba to Flin Flon, both of which passed through Cranberry Portage, a requirement of having large lakes lying North and South of the traditional portage.History of Cranberry Portage Following the conclusion of World War II, the Department of National Defence took a decided interest in the location of Cranberry Portage. With the recent memory of the German V-2 Rocket program, the development of the Russian Nuclear Missile Program, and the subsequent development of the DEW Line (Distant Early Warning System) in the high Arctic in the late 1950s/early 1960s, the Department of National Defence felt it prudent to also construct secondary back-up radar stations further south. Cranberry Portage, with its road and rail access being conveniently located 60 kilometres from a perceived Russian military target like Flin Flon Area mines and smelters, was an ideal location to establish such a back-up system in the interests of national defence, and became one of the locations for a Mid-Canada Line Installation. In March 1964, the Government of Canada ceased its operations in Cranberry Portage. The entire complex that was Mid Canada Line Sector Control Station 700 was sold to the Government of Manitoba, who in turn sold the facility to the Frontier School Division. By the late 1960s, the former Mid Canada Line Installation became Frontier Collegiate Institute Campus, Frontier Collegiate Residence, and the Area Four Administrative Offices. Most of the base facilities are still in use today although many of their purposes have changed. Today, the former Mess Hall provides all dietary services to high school students who reside on campus. The Officers Club is utilized primarily as a meeting room and location for large group presentations, and though the bar is still present, it has not been used for its intended purpose since the change of ownership. The helicopter hangar is now the home to the Area Four school buses. Officers houses are now homes provided to teachers at subsidized rents, while the three barracks are used only for storage. The facility-wide mechanical systems are also still operational including an underground freshwater storage tank. Cranberry Portage is home to the annual Bombardier Rally, where snow machine enthusiasts gather with their Bombardier vehicles.

His scrummaging and loose play were both of a high standard. Fellow West of Scotland and Scotland international player Gordon Brown rated him the best prop he had played alongside. His nickname \\"Mighty Mouse\\" was from the fact that he was relatively small for a prop, but powerful for his size, like the cartoon character of the same name: :\\"Like McLeod, Ian McLauchlan was short and about as broad as a church door... There was always something a bit odd about his figure even before he acquired a certain rotundity that made him more like a French than a British prop.

Sometimes also referred to as response bias, responder bias or reporting bias, this type of measurement bias can be a methodological issue in research involving interviews or questionnaires, in which case it could lead to misclassification of various types of exposure. Recall bias is of particular concern in retrospective studies that use a case-control design to investigate the etiology of a disease or psychiatric condition. For example, in studies of risk factors for breast cancer, women who have had the disease may search their memories more thoroughly than members of the unaffected control group for possible causes of their cancer. Those in the case group (those with breast cancer) may be able to recall a greater number of potential risk factors they had been exposed to than those in the control group (women unaffected by breast cancer). This can potentially exaggerate the relation between a potential risk factor and the disease. To minimize recall bias, some clinical trials have adopted a \\"wash out period\\", i.e., a substantial time period that must elapse between the subject's first observation and their subsequent observation of the same event.

The vessel was built in 1986 as Olympia at the W√§rtsil√§ Perno Shipyard in Turku, Finland for Rederi AB Slite, Sweden for use in Viking Line traffic. She was sold by Irish Continental Group to St. Peter Line in December 2010. History Olympia was built at the W√§rtsil√§ Perno Shipyard in Turku, Finland, for Rederi AB Slite. The ship was launched on 26 April 1986 under the name Olympia, and operated between Stockholm and Helsinki for Viking Line. Olympia was built as a sister ship to MS Mariella. A model of MS Olympia as she appeared during her service with Viking Line. In 1993 Rederi AB Slite suffered financial problems and was forced to declare bankruptcy. Olympia was sold to Irish Continental Group and chartered to P&O; European Ferries who renamed her the Pride of Bilbao. As of 1994, Pride of Bilbao has been registered in Portsmouth, since November 2008 she has been registered in Nassau, Bahamas. In 2002 she received a major refurbishment, during which the vast majority of public spaces were updated and brought in line with P&O; Ferries' new corporate branding of onboard facilities, as well as updating her livery. The vessel operated between Portsmouth and Bilbao between 1993 and 2010, completing one return sailing every three days before this route was closed in September 2010. She has also been previously used to provide a weekly service between Portsmouth and Cherbourg. The Pride of Bilbao briefly featured in an episode of Only Fools and Horses called Strangers on the Shore which saw Del Boy and Rodney Trotter travel to the village of St. Claire a la Chapelle in northern France to represent Uncle Albert at a naval reunion. 2010 On 15 January 2010, P&O; ferries announced that the Portsmouth‚ÄìBilbao route would be closing, with the last crossing from Bilbao 27 September 2010, when the lease for MS Pride of Bilbao expired. P&O; announced that the route was loss-making and they could not fund a new-build replacement for the vessel. Equally, no other existing ships were available for purchase or charter. P&O; stated that for the previous three years they had tried to do all they could to make the route profitable. As of 2019, Brittany Ferries continue to serve the route. Following the closing of the P&O; route Pride of Bilbao was renamed Bilbao in October 2010. The ship left Portsmouth for the last time on 30 September 2010, after all P&O; merchandise and other equipment had been removed, and sailed to Falmouth for refurbishment. Whilst at Falmouth in December 2010 Irish Continental Group sold the vessel to St. Peter Line which acquired the ship for a new service between Saint Petersburg and Stockholm to commence in May 2011 after a refit of the vessel is complete. The ferry was said to bring an extra 400,000 tourists to Saint Petersburg in 2011. She left Falmouth just after Christmas 2010 and made her way to Skagen in Norway arriving 31 December 2010 where she anchored off for a couple of days. On 2 January 2011 she made her way through the Baltic Sea to Klaipƒóda, Lithuania. St. Peter Line St. Peter Line Moby Lines livery, October 2018 The SPL Princess Anastasia made her first voyage for the St. Peter Line in April 2011. She set sail from Saint Petersburg on 31 March and docked in Stockholm the next day on 1 April, completing her first passenger voyage since September 2010. The ferry now operates on a circular service from Stockholm to St Petersburg stopping in Helsinki (Finland) on the outward journey, and both Helsinki (Finland) and Tallinn on the return journey. Possible connection to deaths of yachtsmen Detectives and officers from the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) and Hampshire Constabulary investigating the deaths of three yachtsmen examined the Pride of Bilbao when it arrived in Portsmouth on 29 August 2006. The ship was one of at least five that the MAIB inspected as part of their investigation. It is thought the ferry, or one of the other ships in the area, may have collided, or had a near-miss, with the yacht Ouzo off the Isle of Wight on 20 August, leading to the deaths of all on board. All of the men died from drowning. The MAIB and Police inspected the hull for damage and studied paperwork. P&O; Ferries had previously handed over information from a data recorder on board the ferry which led to the follow-up inspection of the ship. The ship was inspected again on arrival in Portsmouth on 7 September 2006. After offloading passengers and vehicles from the Pride of Bilbao, the vessel was turned to allow the MAIB to inspect the port side and stern. On 20 September 2006 a P&O; Ferries employee from the Pride of Bilbao was arrested by police on suspicion of causing manslaughter through gross negligence. He was released on bail pending further inquiries, and then re-arrested and charged in February 2007. The MAIB report into the sinking of the Ouzo was released on 12 April 2007. It concluded that the sinking of the yacht was due to the Pride of Bilbao colliding with her, or passing so close that she had been swamped or capsized by the vessel's wash. On 28 October 2007 the trial of Michael Hubble, second mate of the Pride of Bilbao started at Winchester Crown Court in Hampshire. The prosecution alleged that Hubble, in sole charge of the ferry at the time of the alleged incident, failed to act properly in charge of a vessel. For example, he failed to inform the captain of the incident, failed to stop the ferry and failed to launch a search vessel ‚Äì all actions it is claimed could have saved the lives of the crew of the Ouzo. All crewmembers had life-vests, and at least one of the crew survived for 12 hours after the incident. The defence contended that lights were visible astern of the ferry, encounters with yachts were common, and the Ouzo was not the vessel involved in the near miss. Hubble was cleared of manslaughter on 12 December 2007, with the jury accepting the defence case that the Ouzo was not the vessel involved.\\"Seaman cleared of yacht killings\\", BBC News, 12 December 2007 The following day he was also cleared of all charges of misconduct under the Merchant Shipping Act.\\"Officer cleared over Ouzo charges\\", BBC News, 13 December 2007 Portsmouth to Bilbao Route Pride of Bilbao entering Portsmouth Harbour Pride of Bilbao (as the ship was known) is probably best known for its time operating the Portsmouth to Bilbao route by P&O; Ferries. When the company took over the ship in 1994 this was the route she was primarily used for. During her time as part of the P&O; Ferries fleet Pride of Bilbao received many refurbishments with a major refit in 2002. From 2006 Pride of Bilbao was the only P&O; Ferries ship to operate from Portsmouth with her completing one return sailing every three days. The company in an attempt to encourage more passengers marketed \\"Mini Cruises\\" with passengers walking on to the ship without a car. When the ship arrived at Bilbao mini cruise passengers would briefly depart the ship while the ship was prepared for its return trip back to Portsmouth. However, all attempts to make the route profitable for the company were exhausted. Mainly because P&O; Ferries competitor Brittany Ferries operated ferries to the nearby port of Santander in 24 hours whereas Pride of Bilbao took 36 hours to reach Bilbao P&O; Ferries charter of the Pride of Bilbao ended on 30 September 2010 and prior to this in January of the same year the company issued a statement that they would not be continuing the charter of the vessel nor find an alternative ship to replace Pride of Bilbao as they claim to having been making losses on the route for some time. The Pride of Bilbao completed her last sailing on 28 September 2010.  November 2019 incident  On the evening of 6 November 2019 SPL Princess Anastasia ran aground outside Liding√∂ in Stockholm en route to Helsinki, after suffering a black-out on the ship's electricity. The ferry was hauled back to Stockholm and was inspected. It did not sustain any bigger damage, and could continue to Helsinki the next morning. There were 1065 people on board at the time of the accident. No passengers or crew got injured. The Swedish Transportation Agency believed the black-out to have been caused by a mixture of Russian and Swedish diesel oil creating a blockage.

southwest of the R√≠o Muni estuary that defines the border with Gabon. Corisco, whose name derives from the Portuguese word for lightning, has an area of just , and its highest point is above sea level. History During the Iron Age (50 BC - 1400 AD) and before the arrival of the Portuguese, the island was densely settled. The most important evidence of human occupation comes from the area of Nand√°, near the eastern coast, where dozens of prehistoric burials have been excavated.Digital.CSIC: Arqueolog√≠a en el Estuario del Muni (Guinea Ecuatorial) These burials belong to two different periods: Early Iron Age (50 BC - 450 AD) and Middle Iron Age (1000-1150 AD). During the first period, the islanders deposited bundles of human bones and iron implements (axes, bracelets, spears, spoons, iron currency) in shallow pits dug in the sand. During the second period, tombs have been documented where the corpses (not preserved) lied down surrounded by pots, probably containing food and alcoholic beverages. The deceased were interred with their adornments (collars, bracelets and anklets) and a few personal possessions (knives and adzes). When Portuguese sailors arrived in the Mino Estuary in 1471, they noted that the islands in the area were mainly unpopulated. They named Corisco after 'lightning', due to the gales they experienced around the island. After more than three centuries of abandonment, when it was sporadically visited by European sailors, Corisco was settled by the Benga people. They arrived during the second half of the 18th century attracted by the prospects of trade with the Europeans. The island was later acquired by Spain in 1843, as a result of an arrangement made by J. J. Lerena y Barry with Benga king Bonkoro I. Bonkoro I died in 1846 and was succeeded by his son Bonkoro II, but due to rivalries on the island, Bonkoro II moved to S√£o Tom√©, and Munga I ruled in Corisco 1848 to 1858, his son Munga II taking over, and meeting the explorer Manuel Iradier in the 1870s. In general the Spanish paid little attention to Corisco. In the early part of the 20th century it was part of the administration of Elobey, Annobon, and Corisco, and postage stamps were issued under that name. It became an integral part of Equatorial Guinea upon independence. Corisco and the surrounding waters of Corisco Bay have become of interest in recent years for their oil prospects. A consortium of Elf Aquitaine and Petrogab began prospecting in 1981. The area is disputed with Gabon because of the perceived value of the oil. In February 2003, Gabonese Defence Minister Ali-Ben Bongo Ondimba visited the islands and re-stated Gabon's claim to them.\\"GABON-EQUATORIAL GUINEA: UN mediates dispute over Corisco Bay islands\\", IRIN, January 23, 2004.

It was first published in 1956 by Eyre & Spottiswoode as part of the anthology Sometime, Never: Three Tales of Imagination (with other stories by William Golding and John Wyndham). A corrupt version of Boy in Darkness was published both in an anthology, The Inner Landscape (1969), and separately in 1976 with an introduction by Peake's widow, Maeve Gilmore. Referring to the corrupt text, she wrote that \\"although the Boy in Boy in Darkness is assuredly Titus Groan, [Peake] did not call him so by name\\"; however, adding the name Titus was one of the specific changes that Peake made between writing and publishing his novella. The correct text has recently become available again in an anthology entitled Boy in Darkness and Other Stories, with a foreword by Joanne Harris and a preface by Peake's son Sebastian, as well as Maeve Gilmore's uncorrected introduction from 1976. Upon publication of the work in 1956, a Glasgow Herald reviewer called it \\"completely hair-raising\\". Edwin Morgan referred to Boy in Darkness as a ‚Äòvery different‚Äô piece, ‚Äòa nouvelle, a sinister epic incident, a reflection in miniature of Titus Groan and Gormenghast.‚Äô The story is one of Mervyn Peake's last prose works. After this he wrote only Titus Alone (1959); by the time it was published, dementia had made writing almost impossible for him, although he continued to draw, intermittently, for several more years. Plot summary Boy in Darkness is an episode in the Gormenghast series when Titus Groan, referred to as \\"the Boy\\" in the story, is a young teenager ‚Äì placing it during the period covered by the second novel in the series, Gormenghast. Yearning for freedom from his ceaseless duties as 77th Earl of Gormenghast, he escapes the ancient castle and encounters the nightmare world outside. Adaptations Boy in Darkness was made into a short film in 2000. Created by the BBC Drama Lab, it utilized computer generated imagery and was set in a virtual world. The film starred Jack Ryder (of EastEnders fame) as Titus, with Terry Jones (of Monty Python's Flying Circus) narrating. Boy in Darkness was adapted for the stage by theatre company Curious Directive and performed at the 2009 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, at Zoo Venues. The Stage heralded it as a \\"Must See\\" saying the production was \\"Dark, haunting and uniquely inventive...

Having performed with many artists as a session player, he is most notable as a member of Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, which he has performed with since 2007 and joined as a full-time member in 2013.  Early life and career  Donockley was born in Workington, Cumbria; his parents were members of a band called Travelling Country. At the age of 16, Troy joined them, playing at many venues in West Cumbria. His father's record collection was broad and gave his son a love of classical, rock, country as well as traditional music. He is a multi-instrumentalist and a master of the Uilleann pipes. His ambition as a teenager was to travel the world as a musician, but hated \\"empty pop created by cynical twerps\\". The strangeness of the sound of the Uilleann pipes enabled him to become a session musician with prog-rockers The Enid in 1987 on their album 'The Seed and the Sower'. Celtic-folk music Donockley on guitar with You Slosh in 1991 In 1987, he formed Celtic Rock band 'You Slosh', recording 'Glorious Racket' with them in 1989. In the following year, he recorded as a session musician with Celtic-folk band Iona. This was at the very beginning of the boom in Celtic-folk bands, and both ventures were very successful. Donockley recorded one more album with You Slosh in 1991, plus nine more albums with Iona. He became an official member of the group in 1995 and left the band in 2009. M√°ire Brennan, a member of the best-known Celtic-folk group, Clannad, called on Donockley to be a session musician on 'Two Horizons'. In 1999, Donockley recorded 'Our Kate' on the album 'Debatable Lands' by Kathryn Tickell, contrasting two types of pipes with her; she plays the Northumbrian smallpipes. Together with Adrian Edmondson, Donockley founded the band The Bad Shepherds in 2008, performing punk and new wave classics on folk instruments. Maddy Prior and Barbara Dickson Both Barbara Dickson and Maddy Prior lived in the north of England and Donockley met them both. Alongside her easy listening albums, Dickson also recorded folk albums. In 1994, and again in 2004, Donockley was a session musician for Dickson's folk albums and then went on to produce several of her albums including 'Words Unspoken' (2010) and 'To Each & Everyone - The Songs of Gerry Rafferty' (2013) . After recording Flesh and Blood with Prior in 1997, Donockley also became co-producer of her next four solo albums. Nightwish Donockley with Nightwish in 2007 Donockley's first appearance with Nightwish was on their 2007 release, Dark Passion Play, as a guest musician, providing some whistles and pipes to the songs \\"The Islander\\", \\"Last of the Wilds\\", and \\"Meadows of Heaven\\". He also joined them on select shows of the subsequent tour and appeared in the music video for \\"The Islander\\". In 2011, Donockley appeared as a guest on Imaginaerum, providing whistles, pipes, and vocals. He joined Nightwish again on the Imaginaerum World Tour, and also appeared on the band's concert DVD 'Showtime, Storytime'. He also appears in the Imaginaerum film from 2012 as a stage illusionist. Following the conclusion of the Imaginaerum World Tour, Donockley was made a full-time member of Nightwish in October 2013. He provides the main vocals for Nightwish‚Äôs single ‚ÄòHarvest‚Äô, released in 2020. This was unusual for the band, as main vocals were usually provided by Floor Jansen. Session work Donockley has recorded as a session musician with Roy Harper, Midge Ure, Del Amitri, Alan Stivell and Status Quo. Bruce Johnson of the Beach Boys has used him. Eight studio albums by prog-rockers Mostly Autumn feature him, as do Welsh prog group Magenta on two albums. He also performed on Etarlis, a 2007 release by Mermaid Kiss. He can be heard on recent movie soundtracks Robin Hood (Ridley Scott, 2010) and Ironclad (Jonathan English, 2011). Notably, he also performed at the Scottish leg of Live 8 with Midge Ure. Classical work Donockley has composed music for choir and orchestra. He has gone to great lengths to find the right kind of studio production. The Unseen Stream (1998) and The Pursuit of Illusion (2003) put the uilleann pipes in a sound mix that had never been heard before. His latest classical work is The Madness of Crowds (2009). Personal life Donockley lives with his wife Terri and daughter Mia in North Yorkshire, England. He is a vegan.

Created by John Byrne, the character made her first appearance in Uncanny X-Men #120 (1979). Publication history Snowbird first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #120 (1979) and was created by John Byrne. Byrne later revealed that, unlike most of the Alpha Flight lineup, she was a \\"fan character\\" who he created years before he began professional work in comics. Fictional character biography Several thousand years before Snowbird's birth, the immensely powerful and malevolent Arctic spirit Tundra sealed the Northern gods ‚Äî including the Inuit goddess Nelvanna ‚Äî within a mystical barrier in another dimension, rendering them incapable of defending the mortal realm of Earth. Through clever persuasion and trickery, Nelvanna bargained with Tundra to strip her of her godly powers so that she could pass through the barrier to find and mate with a male human of Earth. Nelvanna appeared before a man named Richard Easton, insisting upon mating with him in order to produce a child who would grow to battle the evil, mystical \\"Great Beasts\\" of Canada. Easton reluctantly agreed, and the two conceived Snowbird some time in the 1900s near Resolute Bay, Northwest Territories, Canada. Years later, after having been driven mad by his experiences in the spirit realm, Easton worked a spell to summon and control Tundra and was horribly burned up by the completion of the summoning. He only controlled Tundra for a brief period, and Tundra's manifestation was destroyed by Marrina.Alpha Flight #1 Michael Twoyoungmen, also known as Shaman, was chosen to serve as midwife to Nelvanna when she gave birth. Shaman named the child Narya, used a spell to bind her to the earthly realm, and agreed to raise her in his cabin in the Canadian wilderness. Narya grew at a rapid rate and it was discovered that she possessed supernatural abilities. Most notably, that she could transform into any animal native to Canada, gaining the attributes of that creature while in its guise. In addition, she possesses the ability to fly, to sense mystic and magical power, limited precognition and postcognition, and a limited degree of super-strength. However, she is unable to leave Canada's borders without instantly falling ill, due to the literal effects of the binding spell placed on her by Shaman; it is possible that being outside Canada's borders for too long could prove fatal. As a result of that territorial limitation, she almost died during the fight between Alpha Flight and Omega Flight in New York City,Alpha Flight #12 and was unable to pursue the Hulk when he headed south into the U.S. after his fight with Alpha Flight in Vancouver.Alpha Flight #29 Though not much at all is known about Snowbird's childhood, she is believed to have actively engaged in battle against such malevolent Arctic entities as Tundra's kind. Shaman commented that although Snowbird had the body of an adult, it was less than six years since her birth at that point.Alpha Flight #22 (May 1985) When Twoyoungmen's friends, James MacDonald Hudson and Heather Hudson, learned of Narya's powers and origin, they asked the two to join the Canadian super team the Flight, later known as Alpha Flight.Alpha Flight #8 (Mar 1984) Narya adopted the codename \\"Snowbird\\" on the battlefield and the ordinary identity of \\"Anne McKenzie\\" in public. As part of her human identity, she trained to join the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, eventually working as a Records Officer at Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. Snowbird abandoned the secret identity of Anne McKenzie when her new superior, Chief Inspector Hamilton, confined her for her repeated \\"unexcused absences\\"‚Äîwhich occurred as a result of her superhero activities‚Äîand she was subsequently forced to break out to battle Kolomaq.Alpha Flight #6 During her time with the Canadian ranger forces, Snowbird fell in love with her workmate Douglas Thompson. After she entrusted him with her secret,Alpha Flight #15 and #18 she married him,Alpha Flight #34‚Äì35 and gave birth to a child. For that, she was cast out by the other Inuit gods and stripped of her divine essence.Alpha Flight #37‚Äì38 Later, she was possessed by the villain Pestilence, who tried to drain the lives of her teammates after he killed Snowbird's family.Alpha Flight #44 (March 1987) In a mine in Burial Butte, a town in the Canadian Klondike, Vindicator killed Snowbird with a plasma blast to prevent Pestilence from taking possession of Snowbird's body.Alpha Flight #44 Snowbird's spirit passed into the realm of the Inuit gods, but she refused to enter paradise until the gods would also admit her husband and child, which they eventually did.Alpha Flight #45 Pestillence's spirit still possessed Snowbird's body and battled Alpha Flight, but was banished by Heather into the void of Shaman's medicine pouch. The mind of her teammate Walter Langkowski (Sasquatch), who was at that point trapped in Smart Alec's body, was transferred into Snowbird's body, and the body was eventually altered to resemble Walter's own body.Alpha Flight #68 Years later, Snowbird would return from the dead, rising bodily from her grave. She is again an active member of Alpha Flight, and is no longer physically limited to Canada's borders. Much later, a time-displaced alternate Snowbird from relatively early in her Alpha Flight career was brought to the present-day with her teammates. While most of this group was continuing to act as Alpha Flight in the present day, the temporal copy of Snowbird had married Yukon Jack and become queen of his tribe. During the Secret Invasion storyline, Snowbird is sent by her uncle Hodiak to be part of a team of gods dubbed the \\"God Squad\\", assembled by Hercules to battle the Skrull gods; for if the Skrulls win, then the gods of humanity will be devoured or enslaved. When approached by the new Guardian Michael Pointer, she informs him that, due to Alpha Flight's demise, the end of her marriage, and the loss of the Great Beasts, she will not join the new Omega Flight team.Incredible Hercules #117 (July 2008) When captured by Nightmare, it is revealed that her greatest fear is survivor's guilt for not being present at the battle between Pointer and Alpha Flight. During a battle with a group of gods who had been absorbed into the Skrull pantheon, Snowbird changes into Neooqtoq the Ravager, deadliest of the Great Beasts of the north. In doing so, she loses her rational mind, attempting to kill anything in her way. She pulls in all the fallen gods and seemingly collapses into herself.Incredible Hercules #119 (September 2008) However, at the last moment she transformed herself into a swarm of mosquitoes, choosing to honor her fallen teammates by fighting on and rejoins the battle against the Skrull gods and rescues Cho, who has been knocked out of the palace. She returns at a crucial moment and impales the Skrull god Kly'bn on the spine of the slain god-eater Demogorge, eldest child of Gaea, when the Skrull god is knocked back by Hercules. She later carries a weeping Hercules and Amadeus back to Earth in the form of a great white bird.Incredible Hercules #120 (October 2008) Some time later, she attends Hercules' funeral.Hercules: Fall of an Avenger #1 (May 2010) During the Chaos War storyline, Snowbird and Alpha Flight battle Amatusu-Mikaboshi's troops. She only just escapes from the Inuit god's realm before her mother is killed. When she discovers that Sasquatch has brought the Great Beasts to Earth so they can kill Amatsu-Mikaboshi, she is furious and ends up freezing them, after which Mikaboshi impales them.Chaos War: Alpha Flight #1 (January 2011) Powers and abilities Snowbird possesses a number of powers as a member of the race of superhumans known as the gods of the Native Americans of Arctic Canada. Snowbird is a metamorph who is able to change into a pale white version of any creature native to the Canadian Arctic. She can also transform into a female human being; her true face is not human. In this form, she has blonde hair and blue eyes, but they are usually depicted as being solid black with white pupils. When she transforms, she gains all the strength and special abilities of what she transforms into. For example, if she becomes an owl, she would be able to fly. She can draw additional mass from an unidentified and presumably mystical source when she takes the form of an animal whose mass and volume are greater than her base form; she sheds this mass upon return to human form. When she takes the form of an animal whose mass and volume are less than those of a human being, she becomes a human-sized version of that animal. Some things she has transformed into are a swarm of mosquitoes, a sperm whale, Tanaraq (the true form of Sasquatch),Alpha Flight #23 (June 1985) the monster Wendigo,Wolverine Vol. 2 #172 (March 2002) etc. She even transformed into a wolverine and beat Wendigo by ripping him to shreds.Uncanny X-Men #140 (December 1980) However, Snowbird's personality becomes overlaid with the character traits and instinctual patterns of whatever animal's form she is using at the time. Furthermore, the greater the amount of time she spends as a certain animal, the stronger the impression of that animal's psyche on her personality. If she remains in one form for an extended period of time, she risks having her personality fixed as that of the animal, and therefore of never transforming back. Also, transforming from one animal to another without first changing into her base form causes her great strain. However, both of these limitations have been reduced or removed following her resurrection: she has since been shown to talk in animal form, and she transformed from a mountain lion to Wendigo with no strain at all. In her base form, Snowbird has superhuman strength, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes. When she transforms into an animal, she takes the strength and abilities of whatever she transforms into. She also has the ability to fly, but her base form's speed was never stated, and she often assumes the form of a snow owl when she wants to fly. She would also gain the speed of any creature that she transformed into. She has the mental ability to compel others to aid her in her struggle against the Great Beasts, and once mentally controlled Northstar to aid Alpha Flight against them. After a battle with the Great Beast Kolomaq, Snowbird was badly wounded when suddenly a \\"healing glow\\" came over her and all her wounds were instantly healed. This occurs in her base form, but whether she can instantly heal in her other forms is not known. Many years after her death, Alpha Flight found Snowbird in a cylinder in the A.I.M. headquarters. They rescued her and determined that she has an advanced form of cellular rejuvenation. Once she was buried and began to decay, this regeneration process was initiated and carried to fruition over a considerable length of time. This contradicts the fact that currently Sasquatch possesses Snowbird's body, after his was destroyed, and that the body became male. This continuity error has never been addressed. Snowbird grew to adulthood with unusual rapidity and went through an entire pregnancy in two weeks. She has all the knowledge and wisdom of the gods of the Arctic, but due to her young age she does not know how to fully use it, as she is technically only a few years old. She also has the ability of \\"postcognition\\", to envision events that happened up to six hours in the past in her immediate present vicinity. She can replay events in the area, but only she is capable of seeing them. It is unknown if she can do this in forms other than her base form. Being a mystical creature herself, she can pick up and sense various mystical activities from various places. She has mystical senses enabling her to detect the presence of magical energies or the breaching of a magical field. She can also resist teleportation. Talisman of Alpha Flight tried and failed to teleport her back to their headquarters.Alpha Flight #28 (Nov 1985) Shaman's binding process initially restricted her from leaving Canada; upon doing so she would become weaker, although she once went to the United States with the X-Men and was not affected. This restriction was temporarily lifted by Hodiak when Snowbird joined the God Squad during Sacred Invasion. Other versions =Marvel Zombies= In Marvel Zombies: Dead Days, Snowbird is seen as a zombie attacking Cyclops, but then has a pole stabbed through her brain by Magneto.Marvel Zombies: Dead Days one-shot (July 2007) =Ultimate Marvel= In Ultimate X-Men #94 (July 2008), a Canadian First Nations woman in a white costume named Snowbird attacked the X-Men with the help of the Ultimate version of Alpha Flight. She displayed the ability to fly and to create and control blizzard-like weather patterns. Her abilities allowed her to surprise attack Ultimate Storm and quickly knock the young mutant out of the sky with a localized blizzard. In other media =Television= Snowbird appeared in the X-Men animated series, voiced by Melissa Sue Anderson. In the episode \\"Repo Man\\", she displayed her shapeshifting abilities as she assumed the form of a snow owl and a white wolf when trying to capture Wolverine. Snowbird also made a brief appearance in the episode \\"The Phoenix Saga: Child of Light\\".

It was released in Japan on July 6, 2005, in North America on September 20, 2005, and in Europe on February 2, 2006. It is the sequel to the previous year's sleeper hit, Katamari Damacy. This is the last game in the series that had involvement with the series creator Keita Takahashi. Gameplay The concept for this game is as idiosyncratic as its predecessor. Since the release of the original game, the King of All Cosmos and his son the Prince have acquired a fan base. The Prince receives a request from a fan at the start of the game. The objective of the game is to have the Prince fulfill each fan's request, which will make more fans (stages) appear until the whole game is mobbed with fans. Upon fulfilling each fan's request, the Katamari is given to the king, which he uses to create a new planet in the cosmos, this continues until there are enough planets in the cosmos to roll up the sun using the Earth as a katamari. Constellation data can be loaded from Katamari Damacy to help with this task. The gameplay follows the same core mechanic: To gather material, the Prince pushes around his katamari, a magical, highly adhesive ball capable of grabbing anything smaller than itself. Initially, the katamari can only pick up smaller items like loose change and discarded pencils. As more items accumulate, the katamari's power grows, allowing it to pick up ‚Äúvaulting boxes, pencils, erasers, postcards, ramen, robots, cows, sheep, this girl, that boy, moms and dads, bicycles, motorbikes, homes, buildings, rainbows, clouds, islands, hopes and dreams‚Äù. Once the level is successfully completed, the katamari and the Prince (or cousin) are judged by the King, who launches the katamari into space for it to become a planet, satellite, or other celestial object, if deemed acceptable. If the planet has already been created, the katamari can replace it or be shattered into ‚Äústardust‚Äù. If the King does not approve of the katamari, he punishes the Prince by scolding him and shooting him with lasers. The sequel adds many new objectives, including: making the katamari as large as possible with a limited number of objects, collecting objects for their monetary value, rolling a sumo wrestler over food items to gain body mass (and then into his opponent to win the match), pushing a snowball around to create the head of an enormous snowman, and a number of ‚Äúfast as possible‚Äù time attack challenges. Many levels have both a ‚Äúbig as possible‚Äù and a ‚Äúfast as possible‚Äù objective, and some even have three similar objectives of increasing difficulty or size. In the previous game, finding the prince's cousins only unlocked them for use in 2-player mode. We Love Katamari allows the player to switch to the cousins in the 1-player game as well. Additionally, two Royal Presents can now be worn: one on the head or face, and one on the body. The appearance of presents may differ depending on the character that wears them. =Cooperative mode= In addition to the standard, single-player mode, this game features a two-player cooperative gameplay option, in which each player controls half of the katamari. Players must work together to effectively maneuver the ball. Any stage in the game can be completed in solo or cooperative mode; however, in cooperative mode, some extra time is usually added to the game clock to compensate for the difficulty in coordinating the players. In the Snowman level, which has no time limit, this method of play is eschewed in favor of a more traditional one: each player rolls one half of the snowman. Similar to the single-player version of the stage, the snowman is completed as soon as the two players collide; however, because the bottom half is also being rolled by someone, players are not limited to forming the snowman in the middle of the area. In the Japanese and PAL version of the game each player's gamepad is depicted on-screen, illustrating how each player is currently manipulating the dual-analog sticks. This feature was omitted from the American version due to copyright issues. =Battle mode= As in the original game, there is a two- player competitive mode, wherein the opposing players each control their own katamari. Control of the katamari is identical to the regular game, and the objectives are similar. The winner is the player who most fulfills this objective, which is either to collect the most of a small object (such as pencils in the House, or pudding in the Town) or to have collected a single large object at the end of the game (such as a Ginkgo leaf in the House or a ghost in the Town). Unlike Katamari Damacy, battle mode maps are drawn directly from the single-player world (albeit with fewer objects due to technical limits as to how many polygons can be rendered at once), offering a wide variety of diverse regions in which to compete. Story We Love Katamari tells two stories: a self-referential story of how the King of All Cosmos is reacting to the unexpected success of Katamari Damacy, and an origin story of how the King of All Cosmos became the King of All Cosmos, met his wife, and had his son. =Reaction to the success of Katamari Damacy= After completing his goal to recreate the stars in the sky, the King of All Cosmos was surprised to discover that he had many fans down on Earth. Thus begins We Love Katamari, where the King of All Cosmos seeks to help fulfill the wishes of his fans‚Äîwith the help from his son and his son's cousins, who again travel Earth, rolling things up into a Katamari. =The King of All Cosmos‚Äôs origin= The King of All Cosmos's history is told in We Love Katamari‚Äôs cut scenes, interspersed between the game‚Äôs stages. The King of All Cosmos was not always the King. His father was the previous King of All Cosmos (also called Emperor of the Cosmos, or Papa). The future King of All Cosmos grew up either on Earth itself or a planet very much like it, in a giant castle on a hill surrounded by green fields. (Though, early in the game, we are to believe all action takes place in a world called ‚ÄúThe Great Cosmos‚Äù.) His father was a strict person, always pushing his son to go further, a trait which his son would inherit. Whenever the future King would fail a task, or do it incorrectly, he would be punished harshly by his father. Despite being strict and harsh to the future King, he cared so much about his son. He was a boxer in his younger years. While good, he was not the best, and in one telling scene, after losing first place in a boxing tournament, the Emperor throws his son's second-place trophy into the river out of disappointment. Later in life, after an argument concerning a strawberry shortcake, the future King of All Cosmos runs away from home. During this period of rebellion, he gets into fights with street punks who in one altercation slice off the front of his pompadour haircut. In the next scene the dejected future king meets the woman who would become his queen, after the severed end of his pompadour is pieced with her half-eaten loaf of bread to create the shape of a heart. During a subsequent date, the father shows up, as disapproving of his son as ever. In frustration and anger, the son lashes out, knocking his father to the ground. Later that evening, the son inadvertently spies his father deep in thought, staring at the second-place boxing trophy. Recalling the incident from his childhood, and imagining his father stooping to fish the trophy back out of the river, he suddenly realizes the love underlying his father's stern exterior all these years. He bursts into the room, crying, and kneels before his father to beg forgiveness. In the most demonstrative gesture of affection to date, the father places a hand on his son's head. After this reconciliation, all is well between the Emperor, the son, and his fianc√©e. But soon afterward, the Emperor falls ill, and calls his son into his bedroom. Upon entering, the father crowns his son as the new King of All Cosmos, and then collapses into a deep sleep. Moving forward, we see the King as a grown man, pacing back and forth in a waiting room. Suddenly, he hears the sound of a baby crying in the delivery room, as he rushes to investigate, and a nurse appears from a doorway to call him. Later, the King and the Queen are then shown happily looking down at their son, the Prince of All Cosmos, newly born and wrapped in a blanket, the character that the player controls during the game. This scene, although deeply emotional and considered beautiful, is the final cutscene in the game, preceding the epilogue. Secrets and easter eggs Being highly non linear, We Love Katamari lends itself easily to numerous easter eggs, in this case, the deliberate placement of in-game items to create humorous scenes. Since the environments are typically very large, and a player's current katamari size determines what objects a player can physically see, these ‚Äúhidden‚Äù situations can be found literally anywhere. For example, in one level, the player can find the Prince sitting on a photocopier, with Slip (the Cousin who is a flat 2D clone of the Prince) emerging from the paper tray. Other combinations of objects or situations derive their origins from folklore. For example, in one of the outdoor levels, there is a female ghost that rises up and down out of a well, like the character Okiku in the Japanese folktale Banch≈ç Sarayashiki. Another example is the Tsuchinoko, a snake which can be found in the flower bed stage. As in reality, only a few people claim to have seen this snake, and so it is very hard to find in the stage. Also, if the player continues to collect every object again and again in the ‚Äúcredits level‚Äù the ending movie will change slightly each time. Another secret is there is a creature very similar to a Kappa in the game (actually named as a Kappa in the Japanese version). In fact, there is a level where the ‚Äúkappa‚Äù creature is found swimming in a pool near children. In the flower level, a lady titled 'God' when rolled up can be found in the pond with a bear. =Bonus level= After collecting all of the cousins to be found in the game and sequentially rolling them all up in the level represented by the Hoshino boy, a level opens up, telling the player to roll up 1,000,000 roses, which are only scattered about the level as single roses or bouquets of 10 roses, both types respawning after a short time. At first, one may think it is a joke, but it is possible. The roses do not all have to be rolled up in one play session; the player can return to the select meadow, save the game, and come back where he or she left off. The rose ‚Äúfan‚Äù in select meadow appears to grow taller and taller as more roses are collected. When 1,000,000 roses have finally been rolled up, the level will be ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù; that is, the King will take the prince back and give him a little speech, after which the entire clump of roses will be thrown up. The main screen meadow will now have roses scattered throughout and during loading screens, the glowing orb in the bottom right corner will be replaced with a spinning rose. Gamers have created makeshift inventions to help them in completing this time-consuming task, such as positioning the analog sticks of the DualShock controller in a fixed position with rubberbands in order to automate the collection of the million roses. =Bonus movies= As this is the first game in the series to be released in the PAL regions, two bonus movies from the original Japanese Katamari Damacy can be unlocked: the introduction movie from the game, and the Hoshino family cut scenes edited together as a single movie, along with the dubbed versions in English, Japanese, and Korean. These scenes are also included in the Japanese (NTSC) version. The NTSC U.S. Greatest Hits release has a Japanese spoken and a second unlock Korean spoken English subtitled version of the Hoshino family episodes. Soundtrack The official soundtrack album (catalog number COCX-33273) for the game was released in Japan on July 20, 2005. The soundtrack consists of eighteen songs from Namco composers Yuu Miyake, Hiroshi Okubo, Hideki Tobeta, Asuka Sakai, Akitaka Tohyama, Yuri Misumi, Katsuro Tajima, Yoshihito Yano, Tomoki Kanda, and Jun Kamoda. Japanese beatbox artist Dokaka is prominently featured in the game's soundtrack, performing an a cappella version of the series theme ‚ÄúKatamari on the Rocks‚Äù, both with and without lyrics. There is a tribute to the original Katamari Damacy game on the soundtrack, titled \\"Sunbaked Savanna\\". The song is a medley containing many of the songs found in the original game using animal noise samples as the instrumentation. Another tribute can be heard in the song \\"DISCO‚òÖPRINCE\\" with a short clip from ‚ÄúThe Moon and the Prince‚Äù. Both songs were performed by Kenji Ninuma, one of only two returning performers from the original game. Reception We Love Katamari was met with positive reception upon release. GameRankings gave it a score of 86.65%, while Metacritic gave it 86 out of 100. It sold over 116,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2005. The Sydney Morning Herald gave the game all five stars and stated that \\"The way the scale changes seamlessly is incredibly cunning with areas becoming accessible and later off-limits again according to the size of your flotsam-encrusted orb.\\" The Times gave it a favorable review and stated that \\"what's most important about We Love Katamari is that it represents a move in which Electronic Arts, the world's biggest games publisher, has been prepared to release a title that is new, entertaining, and ultimately original.\\" Detroit Free Press, however, gave it three stars out of four and stated that \\"The new game is very much like the old, or I would give We Love Katamari four stars.\\" Awards * E¬≥ 2005 Game Critics Awards: Best Puzzle/Trivia/Parlor Game. * 4th Annual Game Audio Network Guild: Best Original Vocal/Pop Song ‚ÄúKatamari on the Swing‚Äù. * Gaming Target's 52 Games From 2005 We'd Still Be Playing.

As little is known about him, information regarding the Grand Master is mostly based on historians' theories. Walpot hailed from a rich family from Mainz. He was in favour of turning the organization into a military order. The death of the Hohenstaufen emperor Heinrich VI in 1197 caused an important change in the Teutonic Order, and together with King Amalric II of Jerusalem decided to militarize the fraternity, so they were incorporated as an independent military order in 1198 under the direction of Heinrich Walpot von Bassenheim and received privileges from popes Celestine III and Innocent III. In 1199 he received a copy of monastery rules from Gilbert Horal, the Grand Master of the Knights Templar, and on behalf of Pope Innocent III. It was based on the rules of the Templars.

Early years Its origins lie in the early 1970s with the English country dance band Oak, one of a tiny handful at that time that combined melodeon with fiddles. Two members of Oak, husband and wife Rod and Danny Stradling (melodeon and vocals), went on to form The Cotswold Liberation Front, which became The Old Swan Band in 1974. They recruited fiddler Paul Burgess, percussionist Martin Brinsford and the Fraser Sisters (Fi and Jo). Fi (short for Fiona) is a fiddle player and singer; her sister Jo (aged 13 when she joined the band) plays saxophone, clarinet and whistles, and is also a singer and composer. The new band took the English country dance scene by storm. Up to this point the English Folk Dance and Song Society had set the tone for polite decorum at Cecil Sharp House. With a drummer and sax player, The Old Swan Band brought punchiness to a very English repertoire of tunes (and occasional songs), drawn from recordings of traditional English country musicians such as Walter Bulwer, Scan Tester, the Copper family and Reg Hall. Albums The title of the Old Swan Band's first album, released in 1976, was their manifesto ‚Äì \\"No Reels\\". This was a way of saying you would not find fancy reels and jigs or any frantically paced tunes here. In their wake came several other folk dance bands that combined brass instruments with fiddles - the New Victory Band, the Cock and Bull Band and Ramsbottom. After two more albums Rod and Danny Stradling left the band. The band became fiddle-dominated and after recording an EP in 1983, did not return to the recording studio until 2004 ‚Äì a gap of twenty-one years, during which time the band's members also worked on other projects and with other bands. The 2004 album, Swan- Upmanship was, as before, decidedly non-Celtic ‚Äì almost all the tunes were drawn from the English tradition. The line-up on this recording was John Adams (trombone, fiddle), Martin Brinsford (percussion), Paul Burgess (fiddle), Fi Fraser (fiddle), Jo Freya (tenor saxophone, whistle), Neil Gledhill (bass saxophone), Flos Headford (fiddle) and Heather Horsley (keyboard). Other projects Rod Stradling recorded with the English Country Blues Band, the English Country Dance Band, Tiger Moth and Edward II and the Red Hot Polkas. He became editor of Musical Traditions, a highly respected magazine whose archives are now available online . The Fraser Sisters recorded as a duo. Jo Fraser changed her name to Jo Freya as a condition of joining the actors' union Equity, which does not allow two of its members to share the same name. Broadening her repertoire to embrace European influences, she joined Blowzabella and its spin-off Scarp; she also plays with Token Women (as do her sister Fi and Heather Horsley) and with her own pan-European group called Freyja. Martin Brinsford went on to join Brass Monkey, with Martin Carthy. Paul Burgess and Flos Headford were founder-members of the Mellstock Band.

From mid-1942, the group's official name was the Norwegian Naval Independent Unit (NNIU). In October 1943, it became an official part of the Royal Norwegian Navy and was renamed the Royal Norwegian Naval Special Unit (RNNSU). The unit was operated initially by a large number of small fishing boats and later augmented by three fast and well-armed submarine chasers ‚Äì , and . Crossings were mostly made during the winter under the cover of darkness. This meant the crews and passengers had to endure very heavy North Sea conditions, with no lights and constant risk of discovery by German aircraft or patrol boats. There was also the possibility of being captured whilst carrying out the mission on the Norwegian coast. Early on it was decided that camouflage was the best defence, and the boats were disguised as working fishing boats and the crew as fishermen. The fishing boats were armed with light machine guns concealed inside oil drums placed on deck. The operation was under constant threat from German forces, and several missions went awry, of which the Telav√•g tragedy in the spring of 1942 was a prime example. Several fishing boats were lost during the early operations, but after receiving the three submarine chasers there were no more losses. History =Norwegian arrival= When Germany launched Operation Weser√ºbung, the invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940, French and British troops and ships were sent to help the Norwegians. Several coastal towns were bombed and destroyed by the Germans, and during April and May, the British ships had to retreat from mid-Norway. On 29 April, left a devastated Molde with King Haakon VII, Crown Prince Olav, members of the Norwegian Government, and most of the gold from the Norwegian National Bank. In northern Norway, the fighting lasted for another month. A few weeks after the occupation began, the first boats of an \\"armada\\" of fishing vessels and other boats began to arrive in Shetland. Some boats made several journeys across the North Sea carrying refugees. Many of the boats were \\"Hardanger Cutters\\", with a straight bow and long stern from the Bergen area, others the more rounded \\"M√∏re Cutters\\", from the area around √Ölesund. It appeared that the \\"M√∏re Cutter\\" was the strongest and best-fitted for the heavy weather in the North Sea. The boats were of many kinds and shapes, but most of those used as a \\"Shetland Bus\\", were from long, with two masts and equipped with a 30 to 70 hp single-cylinder semi-diesel engine, which made the characteristic \\"tonk-tonk\\" sound. =Formation= Lunna House on Shetland where operations were coordinated. In late 1940, both the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and the Special Operations Executive (SOE) Norwegian Naval Independent Unit (not to be confused with another SOE Norwegian unit: the Norwegian Independent Company. No.1 or Kompani Linge), established a base in Lerwick (pronounced Lerrick); SIS later moved to Peterhead. They asked some of the skippers of the boats that were coming from Norway, if they would return to deliver agents and bring others back to Shetland. This went on throughout the winter of 1940‚Äì41. In early 1941 it was decided formally to establish a group of men and boats to assist the SIS and the SOE. The main purpose of the group was to transfer agents in and out of Norway and provide them with weapons, radios and other supplies. They would also bring out Norwegians who feared arrest by the Germans. Sometimes the group was involved in special operations, like the failed attack on the German battleship , Operation Archery, the raids on M√•l√∏y and Operation Claymore in the Lofoten Islands. The men put in charge of organizing the group were a British Army officer, Major Leslie Mitchell and his assistant, Lieutenant David Howarth RNVR. Upon their arrival in Shetland they commandeered Flemington House, (later named \\"Kergord\\"), in Weisdale, for their headquarters and they found a perfect location in Lunna Ness north of Lerwick, from which the boats could operate. Before then the boats had been moored in Cat Firth. Lunna Ness had a sheltered harbour and a small population that were not too curious about what was going on and Lunna House was used as accommodation for the boat crews. Whilst Mitchell stayed in Flemington, Howarth set up headquarters in Lunna House. Their whole staff consisted of three British sergeants; Almond, Sherwood and Olsen; Norman Edwards, a stenographer; Harald Albertsen, a Norwegian cook at Lunna and two maids in Flemington. During the first winter Flemington House was used to train saboteurs and house agents and to accommodate Norwegian refugees. Later the refugees were received in a special camp at the James Sutherland Herring Factory in Lerwick, administered by James Adie and his Norwegian-born wife. =Facilities= The lack of a slipway and other repair facilities meant that at first the boats had to be repaired at Malakoff's in Lerwick. Later, they moved the boats and crews to Scalloway, where William Moore & Son had a mechanical workshop and where \\"Prince Olav's Slipway\\" was built.When he was 90 years old, Jack Moore, the owner of the workshop, received the highest Norwegian Order that can be given to a civilian; \\"Ridder av den Kongelige Norske St. Olavs Orden\\" (Knight of the Royal Norwegian St. Olav's Order), for his services during the war. Harald Angeltveit and Johan Haldorsen were the head mechanics and Severin Roald became leader of the carpenters. All ship repairs were done there but Lunna Voe was still used for preparing special operations. Dinapore House was headquarters for the base in Scalloway, while Flemington House became quarters for agents awaiting transport to Norway and for de-brief on return. A former net loft, owned by Nicolson & Co. became accommodation for the boat crews and was named \\"Norway House\\". Sevrin Roald's wife, Inga Roald, was the housekeeper. Flemington House was also on occasion visited by high-ranking officers like the Commander-in- chief, Scottish Command and the Admiral Commanding Orkney and Shetland. The most prominent guest was HKH Crown Prince Olav of Norway who visited in October 1942. Mitchell left the base in Scalloway in December 1942 and Captain Arthur William Sclater, known as \\"Rogers\\", became leader of operations; his Norwegian-born wife, Alice, acted as welfare officer for the crews. =Operations = Prince Olav slipway in 2010 At first, there were fourteen fishing boats of various sizes. The original Shetland Bus boat, the Aksel, skippered by August N√¶r√∏y, departed for Bergen from Hamna Voe, on the west side of Lunna Ness, on 30 August 1941. The other crew on this first tour were Mindor Berge, Ivar Brekke, Andreas Gjertsen, and B√•rd Grotle.All the crewmen were civilians and were paid a wage of ¬£4 a week, provided with free accommodation, and given a bonus of ¬£10 for each voyage to Norway. Fishing boats were used at first, but after some losses, it was decided that faster vessels were necessary. On 26 October 1943, the US Navy officially transferred the submarine chasers Hitra, Vigra, and Hessa to the Shetland Bus operation. These craft were long and powered by two 1,200 hp diesel engines, capable of a top speed of , with a normal cruising speed of . When the submarine chasers arrived, the group became an official part of the Royal Norwegian Navy and was renamed the Royal Norwegian Naval Special Unit (RNNSU). * KNM Hitra was commanded by Ingvald Eidsheim. * Vigra was commanded by Leif Larsen. * Hessa was commanded by Petter Salen. They carried out more than 100 tours to Norway, with no loss of men or ships. On 9 May 1945, Vigra, commanded by Larsen, and Hitra, by Eidsheim, entered the harbour of Lyng√∏y near Bergen in free Norway. The group had made 198 trips to Norway in fishing boats and submarine chasers, Leif Larsen completing 52 of them. The \\"Shetland Bus\\" had transported 192 agents and of weapons and supplies to Norway and had brought out 73 agents and 373 refugees. Forty-four members of the group were killed. Notable members The crews of the Shetland Bus (Shetlandsgjengen) were men of the coast, fishermen and sailors with detailed local knowledge. Most came over after the occupation, some with their own vessels, others with vessels that were \\"stolen\\" with the owner's approval. They were young men, most of them in their twenties, some even younger. Many of them did several tours in the spring and summer of 1940, evacuating British soldiers who had been stranded in Norway after the Norwegian Campaign and other British citizens living in Norway. =Leif Larsen= Shetlands Larsen, Norwegian leader of the \\"Bus\\" operations in World War II Leif Larsen (9 January 1906‚Äì12 October 1990) nicknamed Shetlands Larsen, was perhaps the most famous of the Shetland Bus men. In all he made 52 trips to Norway and became the most highly decorated Allied naval officer of the Second World War. Larsen was born in Bergen, Norway and joined the Norwegian volunteers during the Finnish Winter War. Soon after the war in Finland ended, Norway was invaded by Germany. A Swedish officer, Benckert, set up a company of volunteers who made their way to Norway and fought in eastern Norway until 8 June 1940, until the end of war. Larsen arrived in Shetland with the boat M/B Motig I, on 11 February 1941. After training with Kompani Linge in England and Scotland, Larsen returned to Lerwick in the St Magnus on 19 August 1941. He did his first Shetland Bus tour with M/B Siglaos, skippered by Petter Salen, on 14 September 1941. After the loss of the minelayer Nordsj√∏en, where Larsen was second in command, he became a skipper and could choose his own crew. His first crew was Palmer Bj√∏rn√∏y, Leif Kinn, Arne Kinn, K√•re Iversen, Karsten Sangolt, Nils Nipen and Otto Pletten. His first boat was M/K Arthur, the boat that he had \\"requisitioned\\" on his escape from Norway, after the wrecking of Nordsj√∏en. On 8 November 1941, Larsen sailed from Shetland on his first tour as skipper. On their return to Shetland, they ran into a storm and Sangolt was blown overboard and drowned. Larsen made several tours with the Arthur but he also skippered other boats, like M/B Siglaos and M/B Feie. In October 1942, he had to scuttle the Arthur in Throndheimsfjord after a failed attempt to attack the German warship Tirpitz. He and the crew escaped to Sweden but a British agent, A.B. Evans, was arrested and later shot. On 23 March 1943, returning from Tr√¶na, Nordland, with M/K Bergholm, they were attacked by German aircraft. The boat was sunk but Larsen and the crew, many of them wounded, rowed for several days until they reached the coast of Norway, near √Ölesund, but Nils Vika died of his wounds. The other crew were: Andreas F√¶r√∏y, Johannes Kalv√∏, Finn Clausen, Gunnar Clausen, Odd Hansen and William Enoksen. After hiding in different places, they were rescued on 14 April by a Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) from Lerwick with Lieut. Broberg in command. In October 1943, the new submarine chasers arrived and Larsen became commander of Vigra, with the rank of Sub-Lieutenant. In total he made 52 tours to Norway in fishing vessels and submarine chasers. British awards: * Conspicuous Gallantry Medal * Distinguished Service Medal and Bar * Distinguished Service Cross * Distinguished Service Order Norwegian awards: * War Cross with sword (Krigskors med sverd og stjerne) * St Olav's medal (St. Olavsmedaljen med eikegren) * Norwegian War Medal (Krigsmedaljen) * Defence Medal 1940‚Äì1945 (Deltagermedaljen med rosett) =K√•re Iversen= K√•re Emil Iversen, (10 October 1918‚Äì22 August 2001), was born in Flatanger, Norway. He was the son of a sea pilot and had joined his father on the pilot boat. When the Germans attacked Norway he was a fisherman and soon joined the underground army. His activities were discovered by the Germans and he had to leave the country. He and three other men escaped to Shetland in August 1941 with his father's boat, the 42-foot Villa II. From Shetland he was transferred to England where he joined and trained with the Kompani Linge. He was among the men Larsen choose as crew on M/B Arthur and sailed several tours with Larsen. He was crewman on M/B Siglaos, M/B Feie, M/B Harald and M/B Heland. In December 1943, he joined the crew on the submarine chaser Hessa as engineer, under command of Petter Salen. When Hessa was under repair, Iversen served as engineer on Vigra and did one tour on a Norwegian Navy MTB. When Hessa was back again he rejoined the crew and stayed there until the war ended. K√•re Iversen did 57 tours across the North Sea, most of them as engineer. On 6 December 1944, he married the Scalloway girl Christine 'Cissie' Slater. They stayed in Scalloway after the war and had three daughters. In 1996, Shetland Times Ltd. published Iversen's memoirs, I Was a Shetland Bus Man, which was reprinted in 2004, with a new introduction and the title Shetland Bus Man. Memorials Statue of Leif Andreas Larsen in Bergen The first of the Shetland Bus men to lose his life was Nils Nesse, 23, from Bremnes on the island B√∏mlo south of Bergen. He was killed on 28 October 1941, when German aircraft attacked the Siglaos on its way to Shetland from Norway. Nesse was buried at Lunna Kirk churchyard with a Scottish ceremony, because there was no Norwegian clergyman to conduct the funeral. His body was moved to his home in Norway in 1948 and a cross marks his grave at Lunna. Nesse was the second Norwegian buried at Lunna Kirk. The first was an unknown sailor buried on 5 February 1940. He was probably from the cargo ship Hop, that had left Bergen on 2 February 1940 and was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine. The third man was buried 9 June 1942. He was found drifting in the sea by a local crofter, John Johnson from Lunna. The \\"Shetland‚ÄìNorwegian Friendship Society\\" has set up a plaque on the churchyard wall in remembrance to these two unknown men. British naval officer, historian and author David Howarth (28 July 1912‚Äì2 July 1991) requested that his ashes be scattered over the water at Lunna Voe. A memorial plaque is mounted on the churchyard wall at Lunna Kirk. The Shetland Bus Memorial is located at Scalloway, and the local museum has a permanent exhibition relating to the activities of the Shetland Bus. In 2018 Norwegian visitors were among those attending a service at the memorial to commemorate the 75th anniversary of an improvement in the safety of operations as a result of the introduction of new ships - the Hitria, Vigra and Hessa In popular culture Films portraying the Shetland Bus include Shetlandsgjengen (1954; released as Suicide Mission in the United States)IMDB: Shetlandsgjengen (1954) in which Leif Larsen played himself.

Gillett (October 15, 1891 - December 28, 1971) was a director of animated films. He is noted for his Silly Symphonies work for Disney, particularly the 1933 short film Three Little Pigs. Early life He was born in Elmira, New York. His animation career started around 1916 when he was employed by the International Film Service, an early animation studio under the ownership of William Randolph Hearst and the supervision of Gregory La Cava. The studio had been formed in 1915 and first employed experienced animators Frank Moser and William Nolan. Within a year the veterans had been joined by several new recruits. Gillett was probably recruited along with notable co-workers John Foster, Jack King, Isadore Klein, Walter Lantz, Grim Natwick, Ben Sharpsteen and Vernon Stallings. Career In 1929, Gillett joined the Walt Disney Studio where he started out primarily working on Mickey Mouse cartoon shorts. At this point Ub Iwerks was the only experienced animator on staff. Walt Disney visited New York City with the goal of hiring more experienced staff members. The first notable animator hired this way was Ben Sharpsteen, a veteran of the Fleischer Studios. A visit by Disney to the studio of Pat Sullivan resulted in Disney hiring Gillett, the second New York animator to be hired. He started working for Disney in April, 1929.Barrier (2007), p. 71‚Äì72 The move of the two New Yorkers to the Studio coincided with a significant change in the way the staff worked. Up to 1929, Walt Disney had been the de facto director of most of the Studio's films. But now he was pulling back in favor on new directors. Gillett soon moved into the \\"music room\\" (the director's office). The division of responsibilities between them was still, however, informal and somewhat unclear. Disney did not hesitate to intervene and criticize Gillett in front of fellow staff members.Barrier (2007), p. 71‚Äì72 By the Summer of 1929, Iwerks and Gillett were the primary directors of the studio. Iwerks was directing the Silly Symphonies shorts, and Gillett the Mickey Mouse ones, beginning with Wild Waves. The involvement of Disney himself in production details receded.Barrier (2007), p. 74 In 1930 Gillett directed Cannibal Capers, the first of 15 Silly Symphonies shorts to his credit. The shorts directed by Gillett included two Academy Award winners (Flowers and Trees and The Three Little Pigs) and also featured important firsts such as the introduction of the Pluto character and the first animated short to be produced in full-color three-strip Technicolor. Due to the success of The Three Little Pigs, Gillett was recruited to run the Van Beuren Studios in 1934. While working at the Van Beuren Studios, Gillett directed the Technicolor Rainbow Parade animated shorts featuring Molly Moo-Cow, Toonerville Folks and several color Felix the Cat cartoons. He also was the one that hired Joseph Barbera for US$25 a week.Joseph Barbera: My Life in 'Toons: From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century, Turner Pub, Nashville 1995, , p. 45 Gillett shifted the studio production to producing only color cartoon shorts, an innovative step for 1934. The Rainbow Parade shorts imitated the Silly Symphonies, though produced with a lower budget than them. Tom and Jerry were replaced with newer characters.Koszarski (2008), p. 319-320 Gillett introduced Disney-influenced ideas and invited young Disney artists to lecture the New York veterans of Van Beuren. His condescending attitude towards his artists resulted in their resentment. It did not help that he fired about fifty people in a six-months period, citing as reason their failure to meet his standards. The morale of the staff took a blow. In Van Beuren, Gillett attempted to introduce the rigorous quality standards of Disney. But he did so while maintaining the same working conditions which had plagued the animators of the studio: low-budget work, and deadlines filled with uncompensated extra work hours.Sito (2006), unnumbered pages Artists saw their work rejected as substandard and then had to work overtime to replace it. The hard-drinking Gillett gained a reputation for emotional outbursts and instability. A number of artists initiated contact with the Animated Motion Picture Workers Union (AMPWU), and discussed their plans to join the union. But Gillett had his informants among them. On February 14, 1935, Gillett called a staff meeting to announce his knowledge of their union talk. He intimidated the artists into changing their plans, though their discontent remained. He later found out about an inker, Sadie Bodin, who encouraged female staff members to stand up to Gillett and refuse to do extra work. Gillett fired her, despite her protest that this violated the recently passed National Labor Relations Act. He claimed that he fired her for her attitude, rather than her efforts in favor of unionizing. On April 17, 1937 Bodin and her husband started picketing outside the studio. For several days they called attention to Gillett firing labor for union activity. Her former co-workers were too intimidated to stand by her side. The AMPWU filed a formal complaint against Van Beuren with the National Labor Relations Board. In his testimony, Gillett claimed that he did not force employees to work for free. He claimed to have set up a system where employees would bank their hours and take the time as paid leave. The Board ruled in favor of the studio management. In a subsequent staff meeting, Amadee J. Van Beuren states his firm support for Gillett. Gillett used his victory to fire other union agitators. Among them was Phil Klein, who was blacklisted by the New York-based animation studios requiring him to move to California to gain employment with the Disney studio. In 1936, Gillett attempted to revive series focusing on the Toonerville Trolley and Felix the Cat. The failure of both attempts highlights the weaknesses of his efforts to integrate the West Coast-style of Disney with the East Coast-style of Van Beuren. These films lacked the energy and imagination of earlier products of the studio, but also lacked the Disney charm, graphic sophistication, and logical storyline. Van Beuren Studios released its films through a distribution deal with RKO Pictures. In 1936, RKO signed an exclusive distribution deal with the Disney studio, and consequently dumped Van Beuren. The ailing animation studio closed, leaving Gillett unemployed. Gillett returned to Disney. He moved to Walter Lantz Productions in 1938, where he directed and wrote cartoons, sometimes using the pseudonym \\"Gil Burton\\". Gillett left the animation business in 1940. Personal life As confirmed by several golden age animators, among them Shamus Culhane, Bill Littlejohn, Izzy Klein, Grim Natwick and Jack Zander, Gillett was mentally unstable. In his autobiography, Culhane speculates that Gillett suffered from bipolar disorder and notes that he swung from excessive enthusiasm to violent rages to paranoia (once attacking Culhane himself with a spindle when they worked together at Van Beuren's studio), and that he was eventually institutionalized for many years. Culhane's statements have been questioned by historians. Burt's son Ted Gillett(e) was a noted aircraft designer and ham radio engineer in Southern California, where his family had moved when his father first worked for Disney.A Life in the Shadows Filmography =Disney= * Wild Waves (1929) * Cannibal Capers (1930) * The Fire Fighters (1930) * Frolicking Fish (1930) * Arctic Antics (1930) * The Shindig (1930) * The Chain Gang (1930) * The Gorilla Mystery (1930) * Monkey Melodies (1930) * The Picnic (1930) * Winter (1930) * Pioneer Days (1930) * Playful Pan (1930) * The Birthday Party (1931) * Birds of a Feather (1931) * Traffic Troubles (1931) * Mother Goose Melodies (1931) * The Moose Hunt (1931) * The Delivery Boy (1931) * The Busy Beavers (1931) * Mickey Steps Out (1931) * Blue Rhythm (1931) * Fishin' Around (1931) * The Barnyard Broadcast (1931) * The Beach Party (1931) * Mickey Cuts Up (1931) * Mickey's Orphans (1931) * The Duck Hunt (1932) * The Mad Dog (1932) * Flowers and Trees (1932) * Just Dogs (1932) * Mickey's Nightmare (1932) * Bugs in Love (1932) * King Neptune (1932) * The Wayward Canary (1932) * Babes in the Woods (1932) * Mickey's Good Deed (1932) * Mickey's Pal Pluto (1933) * Ye Olden Days (1933) * Three Little Pigs (1933) * Mickey's Gala Premier (1933) * The Steeple Chase (1933) * Giantland (1933) * Shanghaied (1934) * Playful Pluto (1934) * The Big Bad Wolf (1934) * Gulliver Mickey (1934) * Orphan's Benefit (1934) * Mickey Plays Papa (1934) * Lonesome Ghosts (1937) * Moth and the Flame (1938) =Van Beuren Studios= * Pastry Town Wedding (1934) * The Parrotville Fire Department (1934) * The Sunshine Makers (1935) * Parrotville Old Folks (1935) * Japanese Lanterns (1935) * Spinning Mice (1935) * A Picnic Panic (1935) * The Merry Kittens (1935) * Parrotville Post-Office (1935) * Rag Dog (1935) * The Hunting Season (1935) * Scotty Finds a Home (1935) * Bird Scouts (1935) * Molly Moo-Cow and the Butterflies (1935) * Molly Moo-Cow and the Indians (1935) * Molly Moo-Cow and Rip Van Winkle (1935) * Toonerville Trolley (1936) * Felix the Cat in \\"The Goose That Laid the Golden Egg (1936) * Molly Moo-Cow and Robinson Crusoe (1936) * Neptune Nonsense (1936) * Bold King Cole (1936) * Trolley Ahoy (1936) * Toonerville Picnic (1936) References Notes External links 1891 births 1971 deaths American animators American animated film directors Directors of Best Animated Short Academy Award winners People from Elmira, New York Walt Disney Animation Studios people ","title":"Burt Gillett"},{"id":"1361029","text":"D√≥nal Lunny (born 10 March 1947) is an Irish folk musician and producer. He plays left-handed guitar and bouzouki, as well as keyboards and bodhr√°n. As a founding member of popular bands Planxty, The Bothy Band, Moving Hearts, Coolfin, Mozaik, LAPD, and Usher's Island, he has been at the forefront of the renaissance of Irish traditional music for over five decades. D√≥nal Lunny is the brother of musician and producer Manus Lunny. He has a son, Shane, whose mother is singer Sin√©ad O'Connor. Early life D√≥nal Lunny was born on 10 March 1947 in Tullamore. His father Frank was from Enniskillen and his mother, Mary Rogers, came from Ranafast in County Donegal; they raised four boys and five girls. The family moved to Newbridge, County Kildare when D√≥nal was five years old. He attended secondary school at Newbridge College and, in 1963, joined the Patrician Brothers' school for the Intermediate Certificate year. As a teenager, Lunny joined an occasional trio called Rakes of Kildare, with his elder brother Frank and Christy Moore. They played mostly in pubs and were also booked for a couple of gigs, one at Hugh Neeson's pub in Newbridge for Easter Monday in 1966. In 1965, Lunny had enrolled at Dublin's National College of Art & Design where he studied Basic Design and Graphic Design. He also developed an interest in metalwork leading him to become a skilled gold- and-silversmith, although he only practised the craft for a short time before devoting his energies fully to music. During his time in Dublin, he played in a band called The Parnell Folk, with Mick Moloney, Sean Corcoran, Johnny Morrissey and Dan Maher. Performing career =Emmet Spiceland= Later he formed the group Emmet Folk, which also included Mick Moloney and Brian Bolgor, and they started a club at 95 Harcourt Street called The 95 Club. \\"At that time, we'd reached the stage where we had our own repertoire and ... developing [our] own identity rather than just singing everybody's songs. We were taken quite seriously.\\" Eventually, Lunny and Bolgor joined forces with brothers Brian and Mick Byrne from Spiceland Folk to form Emmet Spiceland, which continued as a trio after Bolgor resigned. Their debut album, The First, was released in 1968. As a vocal harmony group, they had a number 1 hit in Ireland with the single \\"Mary from Dungloe\\", which had earlier been popularised in Dublin's folk clubs by Lunny and his Emmet Folk group partner Mick Moloney. =Duo with Andy Irvine= In 1970, Lunny formed a musical partnership with Andy Irvine--who had returned from his travels in Eastern Europe--after an initial gig at a party for the Irish-Soviet Union Friendship conference organised by Se√°n Mac R√©amoinn. They also created their own club night, downstairs at Slattery's Pub in Capel Street, Dublin, which they called 'The Mug's Gig'. This featured Irvine and Lunny, and guest performers such as Ronnie Drew, Mellow Candle, and the group Supply, Demand & Curve. Clodagh Simonds, who co-founded Mellow Candle with Alison O'Donnell in 1963, recalls: =Planxty= In 1971, Lunny and Irvine, plus Liam O'Flynn, played on Moore's second album, Prosperous, which led them to form Planxty shortly thereafter. Their first professional performance took place in Slattery's, in early 1972. The band became a leading proponent of Irish traditional instrumental music. =Celtic Folkweave= In 1974, Lunny produced and performed on the album Celtic Folkweave by Mick Hanly and M√≠che√°l √ì Domhnaill, who had been supporting Planxty on tour. Hanly, √ì'Domhnaill, and Lunny were supported in the studio by O'Flynn on uilleann pipes and whistle, Matt Molloy on flute, Tommy Peoples on fiddle, and Tr√≠ona N√≠ Dhomhnaill on harpsichord‚Äîplayers who would join Lunny in forming The Bothy Band. =The Bothy Band= Also in 1974, Lunny left Planxty to form The Bothy Band, playing guitar and bouzouki. The Bothy Band quickly became one of the prominent bands performing Irish traditional music. Their enthusiasm and musical virtuosity had a significant influence on the Irish traditional music movement that continued well after they disbanded in 1979. =Moving Hearts= After the Bothy Band disbanded, Lunny became a session musician on various projects, including Davey and Morris, the first album to feature Shaun Davey. In 1981, Lunny reunited with Moore to form Moving Hearts, along with a young uilleann piper, Davy Spillane. Following the example of the group Horslips, Moving Hearts combined Irish traditional music with rock and roll, and also added elements of jazz to their sound. The group disbanded in 1985. In February 2007, Moving Hearts reunited for a concert in Dublin. In 2008 and 2009, the group performed again in several concerts in Ireland and the United States. =Coolfin= In 1987, Lunny recorded a solo album titled D√≥nal Lunny (Gael-Linn 1987), which included many guest musicians playing his music and arrangements. In 1998, he produced a similar group project album titled Coolfin. =Mozaik= From 2002 onwards, Lunny and Andy Irvine founded a multicultural band called Mozaik, with Bruce Molsky, Nikola Parov, Rens van der Zalm. Mozaik have performed worldwide and recorded two albums to date.http://donallunny.weebly.com/mozaik.html Lunny playing the bouzouki 2012 =LAPD= On Friday, 20 January 2012, Lunny appeared on stage with LAPD, the latest grouping of players from Planxty; the moniker is made up from the first name initials of Liam O'Flynn, Andy Irvine, Paddy Glackin and D√≥nal Lunny. After a series of occasional concerts, LAPD disbanded and their last gig took place on Saturday 26 October 2013.\\"Andy Irvine is still going strong in his seventies.\\" in Irish Examiner, 5 February 2015.

Called Usher's Island (a reference to the Dublin quay), it had morphed from LAPD and comprises: Lunny, Irvine and Glackin, plus Michael McGoldrick (uilleann pipes, flute and whistle), and John Doyle (guitar).Usher's Island (December 2014).

Production career D√≥nal Lunny at the Craiceann Bodhr√°n Festival 2016, Inis Oirr When Moving Hearts broke up in 1985, Lunny diversified and became a producer. He had already produced a 45-rpm single for Skid Row (featuring 17-year-old Gary Moore) and, in 1975, had produced the album A Silk Purse for electric folk band Spud, managed by Paul McGuinness. He was closely involved in the establishment of a new Irish record label: Mulligan Records (acquired in 2008 by Compass Records), and produced and played on many of its early releases, the first of which was from Pumpkinhead. He played on several Christy Moore albums, and was a producer & session musician on Kate Bush albums. He played bouzouki and bodhr√°n on Shaun Davey's Granuaile, and fiddle on Midnight Well's \\"Saw you running\\". He composed the soundtracks for a Turkish film, Teardrops, and the Irish film Eat the Peach. He also played on the soundtracks of the film This Is My Father and the TV program The River of Sound. In 1989, he contributed synthesizer on Mary Black's breakthrough album No Frontiers. He was the producer and music director of the soundtrack of Bringing It All Back Home, a BBC television documentary series charting the influence of Irish music throughout the world. He produced albums for Paul Brady, Elvis Costello, Indigo Girls, Sin√©ad O'Connor, Clannad, Maurice Lennon, Baaba Maal, and Five Guys Named Moe. He appeared on compilation albums - The Gathering (1981) and Common Ground (1996). In 1994, he produced Irish Australian singer/songwriter Mair√©id Sullivan's first recording, Dancer. He pushed new boundaries with his band Coolfin (1998) which included uilleann piper John McSherry. He appeared at the 2000 Cambridge Folk Festival, and the album that commemorated it. In 2001 Lunny collaborated with Frank Harte on the album My Name is Napoleon Bonaparte. He produced the album Human Child (2007) by Faeroese Eiv√∏r P√°lsd√≥ttir, which is published in two versions, one English and one Faeroese. As an arranger, he has worked for The Waterboys, Fairground Attraction and Eddi Reader. Journey (2000) is a retrospective album. During 2003‚Äì2005, Lunny was part of the reunited Planxty concert tour. He also produced Jimmy MacCarthy's album entitled Hey-Ho Believe, which was released on 12 November 2010. Influence D√≥nal Lunny has some claim to popularising the bouzouki in the Irish music sphere after being gifted an instrument by Andy Irvine, who had himself been introduced to it by Johnny Moynihan in the early days of Sweeney's Men. Lunny ordered a custom-built bouzouki from English luthier Peter Abnett, with a flat back instead of a traditional Greek rounded back. He also invented an acoustic drum kit designed to solve the problem of a bass/percussion instrument in Irish traditional music. The process of building and developing the instrument was featured on his 2010‚Äì2011 RT√â series Lorg Lunny.

Early years Shaun Davey was born in Belfast in 1948 and attended Rockport School in County Down. He graduated from Trinity College, Dublin in the history of Art in 1971. He then took a master's degree at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. In the late 1970s, he made his first recording, Davey and Morris, with James Morris, and guest artist D√≥nal Lunny, produced by Tony Hooper of The Strawbs. He worked as a composer of advertising jingles, including \\"The Pride of the Herd\\" for the National Dairy Council, 7up, Bank of Ireland and many more. Orchestral music relating to Ireland Davey's reputation is built on four large-scale concert works based on Irish history, all using uilleann pipes and folk tunes. #The Brendan Voyage (1980) depicts the journey taken by explorer Tim Severin, in 1978, from Ireland across the Atlantic to Newfoundland in a leather currach. Severin's journey was a recreation of the one allegedly made by Saint Brendan. The style is similar to that of film composer John Williams. The work uses the traditional uilleann pipes to represent the small currach, while the rest of the orchestra represents the conditions, islands and wildlife encountered by the boat. #The Pilgrim (1983) is set in a vaguely medieval world where the Irish, the Bretons and Scots explore the seas of western Europe. It exists in two versions: the 1983 recording made at the Lorient Interceltic Festival, and an expanded version recorded mostly in the 1990s. #Granuaile (1985) tells the story of Gr√°inne O'Malley, an Irish pirate queen in the 16th century. It has more songs than the previous works and features the voice of Rita Connolly (who married Davey soon after). D√≥nal Lunny again contributed as a session musician. It is a homophonic piece of music set in the re mode and was also accompanied by a chamber orchestra. #The Relief of Derry Symphony (1990) has a more obvious symphonic structure. It is based around the 17th century Siege of Derry, showing the Protestants inside and the Catholics outside the beleaguered city. Whereas the previous three works involved uilleann piper Liam O'Flynn, this one uses a Scottish bagpipe band, who enter the auditorium from behind the audience. Other recordings May We Never Have To Say Goodbye, released by the Tara Music label, is a collaboration between Davey, the RT√â National Symphony Orchestra and a number of famous artists. The album takes its name from the anthem specially composed for the Opening Ceremony of the Special Olympics World Summer Games in Croke Park, June 2003, and performed by Rita Connolly, Ronan Tynan and six Dublin choirs. It is presented along with a range of music from Davey's suite, featuring traditional soloists, singers, choir, pipe band, and orchestra, together with percussion. This release also includes previously unrecorded pieces from The Pilgrim, along with (among others): \\"Fill to me the Parting Glass\\" (from the film score of Waking Ned), and \\"Music of the Spheres\\", a magical piece from the Royal Shakespeare Company production of Pericles. Beal Tuinne ‚Äì Live at St. James' church Dingle (TARA4022) is a collection of songs composed by Davey with lyrics based on the poems of the late Kerry Poet Caoimh√≠n √ì Cinn√©ide. Davey is joined on this recording by his wife Rita Connolly and Dingle-based musicians: Seamus Begley, Eil√≠s Kennedy, Lawrence Courtney, Eoin √ì Beaglao√≠, Daith√≠ √ì S√© and Jim Murray. Voices from the Merry Cemetery (TARA4023) is a suite of songs again composed by Davey but this time based on grave inscriptions from the cemetery‚Äîknown as the Merry Cemetery‚Äîof the village of SƒÉp√¢n»õa on Romania's border with Ukraine. For this live recording, Davey has again teamed up with Connolly (vocals) and O'Flynn (uilleann pipes), as well as the Romanian Men's Choir of the Theology Faculty, Sibiu, directed by Pr. Dr. Sorin Dobre and sections from the Romanian State Philharmonia, conducted by David Brophy.  Film composer Davey has worked on numerous films. His most famous film score has been Waking Ned Devine (1998), with contributions from John McSherry, Liam √ì Maonla√≠, The Voice Squad, Nollaig Casey and Arty McGlynn. His other scores include Twelfth Night, The Tailor of Panama and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Television work includes The Hanging Gale for the BBC (the score won an Ivor Novello and was nominated for a BAFTA) and the theme to Ballykissangel (nominated for a BAFTA). In 2000, he collaborated with Richard Nelson on the musical James Joyce's The Dead which was performed on Broadway, for which the score was nominated for a Tony. Other notable work remains Granuaile, which features Connolly's soaring soprano voice. Liam O'Flynn's solo album Out to an Other Side (1993) had several tracks written by Davey. He also created a setting of St. Patrick's Breastplate titled The Deer's Cry, first used on the soundtrack of the TV documentary Who Bombed Birmingham and later included on his album The Pilgrim.

The music can be performed live by instrumentalists or vocalists or may use pre-recorded songs, depending on the format of the event, traditions associated with the prevailing culture and the wishes of the couple being married. Entry and ceremony There are many different styles of music that can be played during the entrance and ceremony.\\"Wedding Ceremony Songs\\" During the service there may be a few hymns, especially in liturgical settings. While some elements of the ceremony may be personalized for a specific couple, the order of service will most of the time follow a similar pattern.Wedding order of service A prelude often precedes the wedding. During the prelude, guests arrive to the gathering place while ambiance music is being played. Calm and light music is usually performed at that time, setting the mood for the ceremony while not being too distracting for the guests. Popular prelude music includes Air on the G string and Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring by Johann Sebastian Bach. Music can be used to announce the arrival of the participants of the wedding (such as a bride's processional), and in many western cultures, this takes the form of a wedding march. For more than a century, the Bridal Chorus from Wagner's Lohengrin (1850), often called \\"Here Comes The Bride\\", has been the most popular processional, and is traditionally played on a pipe organ. Some couples may consider traditional wedding marches clich√©d and choose a more modern piece of music or an alternative such as Canon in D by Johann Pachelbel. Since the televised wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, there has been an upsurge in popularity of Jeremiah Clarke's \\"Prince of Denmark's March\\" for use as processional music; the piece was formerly (and incorrectly) attributed to Henry Purcell as Trumpet Voluntary.Dan Fox (2007) World's Greatest Wedding Music: 50 of the Most Requested Wedding Pieces p.7.

The national and religious song reader. New York: Haworth Press. p. 755 Another popular choice is Widor's Toccata from Symphony for Organ No. 5 (1880). Weddings in other cultures have different formats. In Egypt, there is a specific rhythm called the zaffa. Traditionally, a belly dancer will lead the bride to the wedding hall, accompanied by musicians playing the elzaff, on drums and trumpets, sometimes the flaming torches. This is of unknown antiquity, and may even be from the pre-Islamic era. At Jewish weddings, the entrance of the groom is accompanied by the tune Baruch Haba. Siman Tov (\\"Good Tidings\\") meanwhile is an all-purpose celebratory song. Interfaith marriage ceremonies have benefited by the efforts of several modern composers, many of whom have written processional marches to honor the religious traditions of both the bride and the groom. Included in this group are John Serry Sr. (1968). Post ceremony After the ceremony, there is often a celebratory dance, or reception, where there may be musical entertainment such as a wedding singer, live wedding band, or DJ to play songs for the couple and guests.

Since 1988 he has edited Continuity: A Journal of History.

Folsom is a former associate of the Free Enterprise Institute and the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, both free market think tanks, and a frequent guest of the libertarian organization Foundation for Economic Education. Academic contributions Folsom has written several books that argue against commonly held views about the role of capitalism in the social developments of the Industrial Revolution and the Gilded Age.

Folsom argues that the New Deal did little more than trade temporary poverty relief for crippling tax rates and mountains of debt, and that the post-war recovery is best attributed to the rollback of taxes and regulations imposed under the New Deal.

It was the first electronics manufacturing services (EMS) industry in 1977. Solectron's first customer designed and distributed an electronic controller for solar energy equipment. The name \\"Solectron\\" was a portmanteau of the words \\"solar\\" and \\"electronics\\".Industrial Automation Solectron had sales of around $12 billion a year, and employed 70,000 people in 23 countries. The company was acquired by Flex on October 15, 2007. History Solectron was established in 1977 to provide outsourced manufacturing services to third parties. It was a major manufacturer, but you would have not found its name on any products. Solectron founders Roy Kusumoto and Prabhat Jain saw a growing number of electronics companies in California's Silicon Valley. There was a need to provide printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) services, handling the manufacturing overflow from OEMs. Solectron aimed to provide high-tech companies the ability for their products to be produced and delivered more quickly and efficiently than their competition, and believed that their customers needed a greater level of service for assembly and manufacture of printed circuit boards, cellular phones, along the entire product supply chain.http://www.transparentc.com In 1998, Solectron acquired the computer hardware manufacturing assets of NCR Corporation. =Management succession= Winston H. Chen, Ph.D. (Harvard) purchased Solectron in 1978, a year after he had left IBM to train his younger family members to run his family construction company in Taiwan after his father's passing. His operational strategy, philosophy, and culture allowed it to grow into the largest U.S. and international Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) company. He was CEO and Chairman of the Board until Koichi (Ko) Nishimura, Ph.D., (also from IBM) became Chairman of the board, president and CEO from 1988 until January 2003, during which time Solectron grew from a regional entity into one of the world's largest EMS companies. Solectron won the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in 1997 and in 1991, after Nishimura worked to instill the certification criteria into the company's corporate culture and strategy. Solectron was the first company to win the Baldrige Award in the manufacturing category twice in the program's history. Michael R. Cannon was named president and chief executive officer in January 2003.Michael R. Cannon Formerly, Cannon was president, CEO and a director of Maxtor Corporation, a supplier of hard disk drive storage products and solutions. Solectron implemented Lean Six Sigma operating principles, aiming to execute with greater precision and provide integrated supply chain services. From a single manufacturing location in the early days to eventual global manufacturing presence in Asia, Europe and the Americas (approximately 50 sites worldwide), Solectron offered manufacturing, supply chain management and product life cycle services for technology companies. In 2007, Cannon announced his departure from Solectron to join Dell as their President of Global Operations. Solectron's Chief Financial Officer, Paul Tufano, was named interim CEO while the company searched for a replacement. On June 5, 2007, Flextronics International, Ltd., the Singapore-based contract electronic assembly firm in the U.S., announced its intention to buy Solectron. On October 15, 2007, the eve of the company's 30th anniversary, Solectron was acquired by Flextronics. The deal was concluded at a cost of US$3.6 billion in cash and bonds. Solectron shareholders were offered their choice of either the June 1, 2007 price of the stock or one share of Flextronics stock for every three shares of Solectron stock.

The plumbeous kite breeds in the Neotropical realm, from eastern Mexico to Peru, Bolivia and Argentina. It also breeds on Trinidad. Birds in the north and south of the breeding range, including the populations in Central America, Trinidad, Venezuela and Colombia, and southern Argentina and Brazil, are migratory, moving into tropical South America in the northern winter. This is a bird of lowland forest and savannah, which builds a stick nest in a tree and lays 1-2 blue-white eggs. It is typically long and weighs . It is not particularly gregarious, although it is often seen in flocks during migration. The plumbeous kite has long, pointed wings. Adults are mainly slate-grey, with a paler head and underparts. The short black tail has 2-3 white bands. The eyes are red and the legs are orange. In flight, this kite shows a rufous primary patch. Sexes are similar, but immature birds have white-streaked grey upperparts and dark-streaked whitish underparts. They lack the rufous wing patch. The call of plumbeous kite is a whistled si-see-oo. Their flight is slow, with frequent glides, and the prey is almost exclusively insects taken in the air.

Bush speaks in front of a USA Freedom Corps display. USA Freedom Corps was a White House office and fifth policy council (along with Domestic, Economic, National Security, and Homeland Security) within the Executive Office of the President of the United States under George W. Bush, who as President served as its chair. Bush announced its creation during his 2002 State of the Union Address, and the Corps was officially established the next day (30 January), describing itself as a \\"Coordinating Council... working to strengthen our culture of service and help find opportunities for every American to start volunteering.\\" A USA Freedom Corps Network and online clearinghouse promoted individual volunteer service opportunities within the United States and abroad and connected Americans to opportunities to serve in federal programs, such as AmeriCorps, Peace Corps, and Senior Corps, or to find local service opportunities by zip code and interest. The council and office were also involved with U.S. federal government service programs and provided new support for these existing programs. AmeriCorps grew from 50,000 to 75,000 in 2004. The Peace Corps reached its highest levels in more than 30 years. Freedom Corps also created new programs such as the Citizen Corps for homeland security, Volunteers for Prosperity for international volunteering, and a President's Council on Service and Civic Participation, which promoted the new President's Volunteer Service Award. Henry C. Lozano was Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of USA Freedom Corps from September 11, 2007 until July 25, 2008. He was preceded by Desiree Thompson Sayle and succeeded by Alison T. Young. The first director of the program was John Bridgeland, previously director of the Domestic Policy Council on George W. Bush's White House staff. The USA Freedom Corps also announced it has begun to work \\"with educators and others to help increase civic awareness and participation\\" across the United States and hosted a White House Summit on American History, Civics and Service, resulting in new initiatives to support civic education at the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Archives. In his 2003 State of the Union Address, President Bush also announced that his USA Freedom Corps would provide new support school-based and community-based mentoring, including mentoring children of prisoners, working in partnership with his faith-based initiative. The goal to reach 100,000 children of prisoners with mentors was met. USA Freedom Corps headquarters was on Jackson Place, across from the White House Created within months of the 2001 September 11 attacks, the body sought in part to encourage volunteer participation in homeland security. USA Freedom Corps put in place the first annual measurement of volunteer service at the Census Bureau. Volunteering rose from 59.8 million Americans from September 2001 to 65.4 million Americans by September 2005, sustaining the wave of volunteering that occurred after the terrorist attacks of 9/11.U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Volunteering in the U.S. 2002 -- 2005. In a commentary on the right-wing website NewsMax.com, Miguel A. Faria Jr. attacked the program as statist and collectivist, a \\"bureaucratic boondoggle\\" that might evolve into \\"compulsory service,\\" and the name \\"USA Freedom Corps\\" as an instance of Orwellian Newspeak. Meanwhile, in a piece on the left-wing magazine American Prospect's site, Jeremy Lott critically linked the announcement of the Corps' creation to the controversial Operation TIPS, a program encouraging citizens to report 'suspicious activity'. The Corps came to international attention on January 3, 2005, when George W. Bush named former presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton to lead a major campaign, through the Corps, to raise funds from private individuals and businesses to provide humanitarian support for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. President Obama followed the USA Freedom Corps model by tapping Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton to lead the fundraising efforts in the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Key components of the USA Freedom Corps have been continued under the administration of President Obama, including the Volunteers for Prosperity program that was authorized under the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act; the Citizen Corps for homeland security and its component programs‚ÄîVolunteers in Police Service, Medical Reserve Corps, Community Emergency Response Teams, Fire Corps, and Citizen Corps Councils‚Äîthe President's Volunteer Service Award; and the White House USA Freedom Corps office, now called the White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation.

Bergfilmpionier Arnold Fanck - Vergessener Star He is best known for the extraordinary alpine footage he captured in such films as The Holy Mountain (1926), The White Hell of Pitz Palu (1929), Storm over Mont Blanc (1930), The White Ecstasy (1931), and S.O.S. Eisberg (1933). Fanck was also instrumental in launching the careers of several filmmakers during the Weimar years in Germany, including Leni Riefenstahl, Luis Trenker, and cinematographers Sepp Allgeier, Richard Angst, Hans Schneeberger, and Walter Riml.Inkster 2012, p. 19. Biography Arnold Fanck with his secretary and lover Elisabeth Kind 1933 in Greenland on set of the movie S.O.S. Eisberg. In 1934 both married in Berlin. Arnold Fanck was born on 6 March 1889 in Frankenthal, Germany. Together with Odo Deodatus Tauern, Bernhard Villinger and Rolf Bauer, Fanck established the company \\"Berg- und Sportfilm GmbH Freiburg\\" in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1920. Fanck, who held a PhD in geology, directed mountain films, sports films and ski films. He was assisted by Sepp Allgeier, a cameraman who later worked with Leni Riefenstahl, and worked mostly in the Alps in locations such as the Engadine, Zermatt and the Arlberg and on mountains such as Mont Blanc and Piz Pal√º. His most popular and successful films of the period between the wars include The Holy Mountain (1926), The White Hell of Pitz Palu (1929), Storm over Mont Blanc (1930), The White Ecstasy (1931), and S.O.S. Eisberg (1933)‚Äîall starring Leni Riefenstahl. During the Nazi regime, Fanck got in trouble with propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, since he refused to cooperate -- apparently because of the necessity of joining the party. In 1934, he also began working on his film, The Eternal Dream, which not only starred a French hero in French mountains, but also had a Jewish producer, Gregor Rabinovitch. This conflict brought Fanck into economic difficulties, from which he was only able to escape by accepting a contract from the Japanese ministry of culture in 1936. With The Daughter of the Samurai and other \\"culture films\\", Fanck decided to cooperate with the Nazi regime. Soon afterwards, he produced A German Robinson Crusoe (1938/40) a propaganda film for Bavaria Filmkunst. Arnold Fanck joined the NSDAP in April 1940.Dramatische Berge.

Routledge , pg 245 After World War II, Fanck's main films made during the regime were proscribed by the Allied military governments. Fanck received no further job offers and went to work as a lumberjack. After the screening of his film The Eternal Dream at the mountain film festival in Trento in 1957, Fanck was once again recognized for his artistic achievements. In order to survive his economic difficulties, however, he was forced to sell the rights to his films to a friend, until TV broadcasts improved his situation. Fanck died on 28 September 1974 in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, at the age of 85. He is buried in the Hauptfriedhof in Freiburg.

Seven Hills is within the local government areas of the City of Parramatta and Blacktown City councils. The suburb is sometimes referred to as part of the Hills District. History Prior to European settlement in the 1790s, the area now known as Seven Hills was originally settled and occupied for hundreds, if not thousands, of years by indigenous peoples who most probably would have identified with the Warmuli and Toogagal clans, of the Darug nation. The vicinity of Seven Hills was first visited by Europeans very early on in the settlement of the colony of New South Wales, possibly as early as April 1788 by Arthur Phillip or more certainly by Watkin Tench in June 1789. The first land grant by the colonial administration (in what was then known as the \\"District of Toongabbee\\") was to an ex Marine soldier, John Redmond in May 1793, whose grant of was adjacent to a track which later became Station Road. At least 13 further grants were made in this area before 1800. Matthew Pearce (1762‚Äì1831) was granted ) in 1795, which he named after Kings Langley in Hertfordshire, England, where he was said to have been born. George Best and John Pye Snr were given land grants in Seven Hills in 1796. The area of the Pearce grant bounded by the present Old Windsor Road, Seven Hills Road, Chapel Lane (in what is now Baulkham Hills) and Toongabbie Creek became known as Seven Hills from about 1800, because his farm was situated near the seventh hill along the road from Parramatta.The Seven Hills, by Jack Brook, Blacktown & District Historical Society, 2001 In 1804 part of the Cumberland Plain in an area which later became the Grantham Estate was reserved for use as Prospect Common and at some time after this possibly around 1819 two land grants were made to Samuel Haynes and Samuel Dent. Seven Hills encompassed a much larger area than now and as late as 1900, landowners as far afield as the modern suburbs of Bella Vista, Glenwood, and Parklea identified their properties as being located in Seven Hills. In the period 1959 to the 1970s, housing schemes excised land that was previously part of Seven Hills to create the suburbs of Lalor Park and Kings Langley.Jack Brook The Seven Hills - A village divided, a suburb united 2004 The railway from Parramatta to Blacktown Road station (now Blacktown) was completed as a single line in 1860. A stationmaster's residence and siding were constructed near a level crossing at what was to become Toongabbie Road (later Seven Hills Road) in December 1863. A platform was built in 1869, and stops at the station were scheduled in the timetable from September of that year. The road bridge on Seven Hills Road across the railway line was constructed in 1975, replacing the level crossing. =Grantham Heritage Park= The Haynes and Dent lots were acquired in 1897 by William Chadwick. Chadwick commissioned a Sydney architect, Byera Hadley (later to become the leading architectural academic in NSW), to build a large house on the land which he named \\"Melrose\\". A much smaller house known as \\"Drumtochty\\" had been built around 1890 on the estate, to the south, at the corner of Seven Hills Road and what is now Australorp Avenue. In 1901 the property was acquired by John Rabone who commenced a poultry breeding and experimental farm which he named \\"Grantham Poultry Stud\\". In 1906 there was a further change in ownership and the farm was under the control of Martin & Co owned by a Mr Francis Martin. In 1912 the company appointed James Hadlington who concurrently held the position as the state Department of Agriculture's \\"Poultry Expert\\". \\"Melrose\\" in 2008 View of the restored \\"Melrose\\" taken from the east side looking west - 2015 A still extant soldier settlement house in 2010 - the external fabric is almost unchanged. This recreation reserve on Grantham Road commemorates the soldier settlers By 1917 Australia was confronting the problem of providing suitable employment for both able-bodied and disabled veterans of the First World War. This led to the development of soldier settlement schemes. Hadlington persuaded the state government to acquire the farm for such a scheme it being thought that ex- servicemen including those disabled and even limbless would be able to make an adequate living for themselves and their families from poultry farming. The transfer took place in July 1917 and the area of the farm nearer Seven Hills Station fronting (what is now) Grantham Road was subdivided into eleven blocks for married men with the balance becoming a poultry breeding, stock and feed storage and training facility named \\"Grantham State Poultry Farm\\". Initially the ex-servicemen trainees on the farm were housed in tents but by 1918 barracks-like accommodation had been put up near Seven Hills Road. The small farms were initially taken up by \\"maimed settlers\\" who occupied small houses which had been built for them and their families. As with other such schemes some of the settlers found it hard to make a living from agriculture despite establishment loans and sustenance payments and by 1922 some of the original occupiers had abandoned the project leaving the blocks for other ex-servicemen to take over. Over the next three decades the farms were turned over to other activities or further subdivided and by the 1950s none were being used for poultry farming although many such enterprises had been successfully established in the surrounding districts principally by migrants from Europe. In 1923 the \\"Grantham State Poultry Farm\\" was no longer required for the settlement scheme and passed to the Department of Agriculture for use as a demonstration farm and named the \\"Government Poultry Farm\\". In 1939 the farm's function changed to one of experimentation and research aimed at improving the quality of the poultry farming in the state. This led to yet another change in name with the farm becoming known as \\"Poultry Experiment Farm, Seven Hills\\". From the 1940s the farm was the site of ground breaking research (notably by Professor Bill McClymont and Dr Len Hart) into poultry husbandry and nutrition leading to significant improvements in the efficiency of poultry farming in Australia and overseas. This was officially recognised when the name was changed to the Poultry Research Station in 1960. The 1971 office block now occupied by Blacktown City Council in 2010 In 1971 a new building was erected to house research and administrative functions of the research station and (later) offices of the NSW Egg Marketing Board. By 1983 the site was known as \\"Agricultural Station, Seven Hills\\" and operations had begun to wind down. Much of the Department of Agriculture land was declared surplus to requirements and by 1989 the station had closed and the land sold off for residential development.

In 2004 the remnant of the estate including \\"Melrose\\", \\"Drumtochty\\" (by now moved to the northern end of the estate) and the administrative building were acquired the City of Blacktown. In 2008 a plan for the use of the administration building as council offices and the development of the lands as a heritage park was announced and public comment was invited. The remnant portion has been named \\"Grantham Heritage Park\\". The entire estate, including Melrose and Drumtochty, is heritage-listed.State Heritage Register The Heritage Park from Seven Hills Road South looking north showing some of the remnant Cumberland Plains vegetationThe park lands contain some of the last vestiges of Cumberland Plain woodlands and the Grantham Heritage Park Memorial commemorating the soldier settlers and trainees.

Florida Place, a cul-de-sac, is typical of many residential streets in Seven Hills especially those south of the railway. The buildings show a transition from the mid 20th century single storey mixed construction dwellings with an average of approx 100 m¬≤ floorspace on 600 to 900 m¬≤ blocks to replacement two storey brick veneer dwellings built in the 2000s with twice to three times the floorspace. Leabons Lane, is typical of streets that are used as transport corridors with a mix of residential and light commercial use. Despite being narrow it is a busy thoroughfare linking the residential areas of south Seven Hills with Blacktown. Note the plethora of signage, traffic calming devices and utility poles strung with overhead power and TV cabling typical of streetscapes in western Sydney.

It consists of two districts: Badulla and Moneragala. The provincial capital is Badulla. Uva is bordered by Eastern, Southern, Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces. Its major tourist attractions are Dunhinda falls, Diyaluma Falls, Rawana Falls, the Yala National Park (lying partly in the Southern and Eastern Provinces) and Gal Oya National Park (lying partly in the Eastern Province). The Gal Oya hills and the Central mountains are the main uplands, while the Mahaweli (Sinhalese: great-sandy) and Menik (Sinhalese: gemstone) rivers and the huge Senanayake Samudraya and Maduru Oya Reservoirs are the major waterways. History The provincial history records an 1818 uprising (the Third Kandyan War) against the British colonial government which had been controlling the formally independent Udarata (Sinhalese: Up-Country), of which Uva was a province. The uprising was led by Keppetipola Disawe - a rebel leader that the Sinhalese celebrate even today - who was sent initially by the British Government to stop the uprising. The rebels captured Matale and Kandy before Keppetipola fell ill and was captured - and beheaded by the British. His skull was abnormal - as it was wider than usual - and was sent to Britain for analysis. It was returned to Sri Lanka after independence, and now rests in the Kandyan Museum. The British successfully suppressed the rebellion and as retribution the entire able bodied male population of Uva region above the age of 18 years was killed while homes in the entire region were also destroyed. They also destroyed the irrigation systems, poisoned the wells, killed all cattle and other domesticated animals, and burnt all cultivated fields in the area of uprising.Sri Lanka is to revoke British Governor‚Äôs infamous Gazette Notification , Asian Tribune, Sat, 2011-03-12.

Harmonium was reissued in 1931 with three poems omitted and fourteen new poems added.Heyen, William. p. 147. The poems from the 1923 that were omitted from the 1931 edition are \\"The Silver Plough- Boy,\\" \\"Exposition of the Contents of a Cab\\" and \\"Architecture\\".

See also the LibriVox site for the complete public domain poems of Wallace Stevens. Initial reception in 1923 The book's first edition sold only a hundred copies before being remaindered,Robert Rehder adds: \\"During the 1924 Christmas season, two young poets, Richard Blackmur and Conrad Aiken, found that the first edition had been remaindered in the basement of Filene's, the Boston department store, at 11¬¢ a copy. They recognized the book's merit and bought all the copies to send as Christmas cards to their friends. The poet took a more ironic view of the book's sales. Around July 1924, he wrote to Harriet Monroe: 'My royalties for the first half of 1924 amounted to $6.70. I shall have to charter a boat and take my friends around the world.' (L 243)\\" (See Stevens, H. p. 243 for the letter.) suggesting that the poet and critic Mark Van Doren had it right when he wrote in The Nation in 1923 that Stevens' wit \\"is tentative, perverse, and superfine; and it will never be popular.\\"Van Doren, p 400 Yet by 1960 the cottage industry of Stevens studies was becoming a \\"multinational conglomerate\\",Axelrod and Reese, p. 11 more than fulfilling Van Doren's prophecy that some day a monograph would be written that would pay tribute to Stevens' \\"delicately enunciated melody, his economy, his clipped cleanliness of line, his gentle excellence.\\"Van Doren, p. 401 A library search in the twenty-first century at a typical university could be expected to bring up about 200 books under the topic \\"Wallace Stevens\\". The Wallace Stevens Journal has been published by the Wallace Stevens Society since 1979 and its editor, John N. Serio, has collected some of the journal's essays in The Cambridge Companion to Wallace Stevens. An audiobook of his complete public domain poems was completed by Librivox in 2007. \\"Anecdote of the Jar\\" has become not only Stevens' signature but also an icon of American poetry. Critical assessments Poet and editor Harriet Monroe, who founded Poetry magazine in 1912, wrote in 1924, > [T]here was never a more flavorously original poetic personality than the > author of this book. If one seeks sheer beauty of sound, phrase, rhythm, > packed with prismatically colored ideas by a mind at once wise and > whimsical, one should open one's eyes and ears, sharpen one's wits, widen > one's sympathies to include rare and exquisite aspects of life, and then run > for this volume of iridescent poems.Monroe, 28 The poet Marianne Moore, Stevens' lifelong ally and friend, wrote shortly after the book's publication of Stevens' \\"achieved remoteness\\" of imagination, likening the poems to a painting that Tu Muh commented upon: > Powerful is the painting... and high is it hung on the spotless wall in the > lofty hall of your mansion.\\"Moore, p. 84 \\"Sea Surface Full of Clouds\\" illustrates this quality.This poem did not appear until 1924. (It was included in the 1931 edition of Harmonium.) Because of frequent copyright extensions, notably the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and its like, it will not emerge from copyright restriction into the public domain until 2025. However, it can be found on the Internet. Although Joan Richardson's reading makes the case that the poem's \\"true subject\\" is an extended holiday that Stevens and his wife, Elsie, took in the fall of 1923, and specifically that the true subject is the poet's sexuality,Richardson 1982, p. 61. Richardson concludes her reading by acknowledging this distinction: > In closing, I offer the following observations taken from \\"The Irrational > Element in Poetry:\\" \\"One is always writing about two things at the same time > in poetry and it is this that produces the tension characteristic of poetry. > One is the true subject and the other is the poetry of the subject. The > difficulty of sticking to the true subject, when it is the poetry of the > subject that is paramount in one's mind, need only be mentioned to be > understood.\\" rather it is the powerful \\"poetry of the subject\\" that displays Stevens' genius and draws readers to the poem, as Tu Muh was drawn to the painting. Moore casts Stevens as an explorer of the exotic who takes refuge in a \\"riot of gorgeousness\\". She adds that although \\"Mr. Stevens is never inadvertently crude, one is conscious...of a deliberate bearishness‚Äîa shadow of acrimonious, unprovoked contumely.\\"Axelrod and Deese, p. 4 Stevens seems to admit as much in \\"The Weeping Burgher\\". \\"The Death of a Soldier\\" may have been one of the poems she had in mind, because of its almost brutal naturalism. Edmund Wilson, writing in The New Republic in 1924, spoke without pretence for most readers of Stevens: \\"Even when you do not know what he is saying, you know that he is saying it well\\". This 'Wilson effect' is no doubt linked to Stevens' Adagia aphorism, \\"Poetry must resist the intelligence almost successfully\\".Kermode and Richardson, p. 910. \\"Colloquy with a Polish Aunt\\" is a good candidate for a Wilson award.Another good candidate is \\"New England Verses\\" which comprises sixteen stanzas, including these: > III > Soupe Aux Perles > Health-o, when ginger and fromage bewitch > the vile antithesis of poor and rich. IV > Soupe Sans Perles > I crosses in '38 in the Western Head. > It depends which way you crossed, the tea-bell said. Matthew Josephson ranked Stevens among the best of contemporary poets, writing in 1923 that Stevens exhibits both a poetry of sensuousness and a metaphysical poetry. He favors the latter, as in \\"Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird\\" and \\"Anecdote of the Jar\\", predicting that they will be \\"spell-binding for hundreds of years\\". By contrast Charles Altieri has recently expressed a preference for the poetry of sensuousness. Stevens matters as a poet, according to Altieri, because of his commitment to the primacy of the senses. \\"Disillusionment of Ten O'Clock\\", which peppers the reader with visual images, would serve as a simple example, \\"Sea Surface Full of Clouds\\" as more complex. The Imagist poet and critic John Gould Fletcher wrote in 1923 that because of his honesty Stevens stands \\"head and shoulders\\" above the internationally famous aesthetes like Eliot, the Sitwells, and Val√©ry. He defended Stevens' \\"obscurity\\" as deriving from \\"a wealth of meaning and allusion\\". He discerned a poet \\"definitely out of tune with life and with his surroundings, and...seeking an escape into a sphere of finer harmony between instinct and intelligence\\". \\"The Wind Shifts\\" is one poem that supports Fletcher's reading. He warned that Stevens faced \\"a clear choice of evils: he must either expand his range to take in more of human experience, or give up writing altogether. Harmonium is a sublimation which does not permit a sequel.\\"Axelrod and Deese, p.4 Stevens seems to have grasped both horns of the dilemma, writing little for several years after Harmonium and then returning with Ideas of Order and subsequent collections that emphasize what Fletcher would classify as metaphysical poetry. Buttel prefers to view the later work as \\"a kind of exfoliation\\" of his earlier style, the later poems \\"adumbrated\\" in Harmonium.Buttel, p. 250 Stevens' first idea for the title of The Collected Poems was The Whole of Harmonium.Critchley, p. 32) Louis Untermeyer, suspicious of international influences on American poetry, criticized Stevens in 1924 as a \\"conscious aesthete\\" at war with reality, achieving little beyond \\"an amusing precosity\\". He can only \\"smile indulgently\\" at the \\"childish\\" love of alliteration and assonance in \\"Chieftain Iffucan of Azcan in caftan\\" or \\"Gloomy grammarians in golden gowns\\", and he is irritated by the confusing titles: \\"The Emperor of Ice Cream\\", \\"The Paltry Nude Starts on a Spring Voyage\\", \\"Frogs Eat Butterflies. Snakes Eat Frogs. Hogs Eat Snakes. Men Eat Hogs\\".Untermeyer, p 30 On the evidence of the exquisite miniature \\"Tea\\", Alfred Kreymberg had been led to expect a \\"slender, ethereal being, shy and sensitive\\", according to Milton Bates, who continues, \\"the poet he actually met at a social gathering for Rogue contributors stood over six feet tall and weighed over two hundred pounds\\".Bates, M., p. 88 To the caricature of \\"aesthete\\" Gorham Munson added \\"dandy\\" in \\"The Dandyism of Wallace Stevens\\", objecting to what he took to be Stevens' indifference to political and social issues of the era. Munson was impressed by the influence of French: \\"The whole tendency of his vocabulary is, in fact, toward the lightness and coolness and transparency of French.\\"Munson, p. 414 In view of suspicions about international influences at that time, this may have been unfortunate praise. However, Stevens would have accepted it, having written in Adagia, \\"French and English constitute a single language\\".Kermode and Richardson, p. 914 The epithet \\"dandy\\" became \\"hedonist\\" in Yvor Winters's 1943 essay \\"Wallace Stevens, or the Hedonist's Progress\\", which objected that Stevens did not give primacy to the intellect or to orthodox Christian beliefs. Winters characterized Stevens as \\"a cool master\\", in an essay with that title, in which he describes Stevens as \\"this greatest of living and of American poets\\".Winters, p. 287 Possibly the most disgruntled reader of Stevens' early poems was the Irish-American poet Shaemas O'Scheel, the author of an Irish war poem, \\"They Went Forth to Battle, But They Always Fell\\". Reviewing Stevens' poems that appeared in the \\"War Number\\" (November 1914) of the journal Poetry, O\\"Sheel, writing in a competing journal, condemned the entire \\"War Number\\" but cited Stevens' \\"Phases\\" in particular as \\"an excellent example\\" of poetry that is \\"untruthful, and nauseating to read\\".Axelrod and Deese, p. 1 Favoring Harmoniums \\"sensualism\\", as exampled in \\"Metaphors of a Magnifico\\", marks a divide among critics, for there are many who, like Helen Vendler, champion the later poetry. \\"I think, with others, that Stevens' powers increased with age\\", she writes.Vendler, p. 5 Josephson chooses these lines from \\"Banal Sojourn\\" to illustrate Stevens' poetry of sensuousness: > The sky is a blue gum streaked with rose. The trees are black. The grackles > crack their throats of bone in the smooth air. Moisture and heat have > swollen the garden into a slum of bloom. Pardie! Summer is like a fat beast, > sleepy in mildew... Josephson's objection to this side of Stevens is that he in his next book \\"would have to be more and more intimate and scandalous, ad absurdum\\", and that already this side \\"has influenced many of his younger contemporaries, and in them, at least, leads to pretense, and murkiness\\".Josephson, 32 There are those who maintain that both the aesthete and sensualist readings overlook the American burgher in Stevens, the successful insurance executive possessed of \\"something of the mountainous gruffness that we recognize in ourselves as American‚Äîthe stamina, the powerful grain showing in a kind of indifference\\".Richard Eberhart, quoted in Bates, p. 89. This character trait may be reflected in the element of anti-poetry in Stevens' work, as in his choice of the word 'stupid' in \\"Hibiscus on the Sleeping Shores\\", or the \\"tink and tank and tunk-a-tunk-tunk\\" of \\"A High-Toned Old Christian Woman\\". \\"There are in Stevens many moments rich in beauty\\", Robert Rehder writes, \\"but he does not want them to be too sweet and resists 'the bawds of euphony'\\".Rehder, p. 27 Stevens' fondness for American locale helps him temper many such moments. A poem like \\"The Jack-Rabbit\\" illustrates his affection for rural and frontier America and the native folk tradition, leaving no doubt that his poetry is rooted in America.Less charitably, the poem might be construed as Stevens' unwitting patrician racism. Another poem that is ambiguous in this respect is \\"The Virgin Carrying a Lantern.\\" Poems like \\"Ploughing on Sunday\\", \\"The Doctor of Geneva\\" and \\"Bantam in Pine-Woods\\" are an implicit tribute to Walt Whitman and other American poets, including himself, making evident his pride in the poetic revolution taking place on the North American continent. Indian names are another aspect of Stevens' Americana, as in the title of \\"Stars at Tallapoosa\\". Movement away from European influences and toward the responsibility of writing distinctly American poetry may be traced to \\"Anecdote of the Jar\\" (1919). Bates suggests that Stevens the American burgher was self-conscious about the poses of aesthete and dandy, writing, > It is as though Stevens, having assumed the pose of aesthete, had suddenly > caught sight of himself in a mirror; thereafter, his dismay and amusement > became an integral part of the pose. The same might be said of his dandiacal > poems, for the dandy is by definition someone who lives always as though > reflected in a mirror; the dandy's vaunted wit sprang in the first place > from an awareness of his own absurd pretensions. Further compounding the > aesthetic dandy's self-consciousness, in Stevens' case, was his burgherly > sense of his own foppish creations.Bates, p. 114 Allen Tate suggests a different interpretation in maintaining that Stevens' dandyism was \\"the perfect surface beneath which plays an intense Puritanism\\".Tate, p. 506 The burgher does not look on with ironic dismay but rather uses the poses to achieve reticence about self-disclosure. The poses allow modulation in revelation of the poet and his world. Tony Sharpe expresses a similar thought when he refers to Stevens as \\"that exponent of American loneliness\\".Sharpe, p. x Meaning and syntax Stevens is often called a symbolist poet. Vendler notes that the first task undertaken by the early critics of Stevens was to \\"decode\\" his \\"symbols\\". The scare-quotes are Vendler's. Color symbolism is a vital part of Stevens' poetic technique, according to the symbolist critic Veena Rani Prasad,Prasad, pp. 1‚Äì10; pr√©cis in The Wallace Stevens Journal, p. 138. who proposes the following color scheme for reading Stevens. > blue ‚Äì imagination; > green ‚Äì the physical > red ‚Äì reality > gold ‚Äì sun > purple ‚Äì delight in the imagination Vendler accuses the decoders of producing \\"some commentary of extraordinary banality\\",Vendler, p. 53. and favors appreciating Stevens' poems by understanding their syntactical novelty rather than by decoding the meanings of their symbols. Stevens lends support to this position, or at least expresses skepticism about 'decoding', when he writes in Adagia, \\"A poem need not have a meaning and like most things in nature often does not have.\\" The upshot of Vendler's syntactical approach is to situate his poems in the realm of possibilities and potentialities, according to Beverly Maeder, who credits her with pointing the way.Maeder, p. 158 Meaning or semantics is fundamentally about word-world relationships, which are particularly problematic in Stevens' poetry. His syntactical innovations are employed to frustrate simple answers about the relationship between language and reality. For instance, his use of the verb seem gives priority to appearances or aspects: \\"Let be be finale of seem\\". Also orienting the poems away from certainties about an unproblematically given world are similes with like or as, the hypothetical as if, the modal might, the conditional, sentence fragments, optatives, questions and protean usage of the verb to be (as when an observer beholds \\"Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is\\". Stevens' symbolism is in aid of a polarity between \\"things as they are\\" and \\"things imagined\\".Heringman, p. 325 This is at least often the true subject of his poetry. However, as the exchange between Joan Richarson and Helen Vendler attests, the true subject of a poem can be a matter of some controversy. For one thing, it can look 'up' to the ideas about imagination/reality, or it can look 'down' to the problems or pathologies of Stevens' life.Le Monocle de Mon Oncle Up for grabs is whether \\"things as they are\\" are to be understood in naturalistic terms (a tree is a tree) or in idealist or perspectival terms (a tree reduces to the various tree-perspectives) or Kantian terms (there is something, whatever it is, that is responsible for the tree, or the various tree-perspectives: Kant's ding-an- sich). The tree in \\"Of the Surface of Things\\" poses an interesting test of such philosophical interpretations. Also there is a moment in Stevens' poetic development when he realizes that the polarity of things as they are and things imagined is not safe, when red bleeds into blue in \\"Anecdote of the Prince of Peacocks\\", Stevens' brutal encounter with Berserk. (See also \\"The Cuban Doctor\\" for a comparable encounter with the Indian.) With an emphatic warning about the danger of depending on mechanical symbol mapping to understand Stevens' poems, one can propose that imagination, order and the ideal are often symbolized by blue, the moon, the polar north, winter, music, poetry, and art. Actuality and disorder are often represented by yellow, the sun, the tropic south, summer, physical nature. For instance, sun and moon represent this duality in Harmoniums \\"The Comedian as the letter C\\", in which the protagonist, Crispin, conceives his voyage of self-discovery as a poet to be > An up and down between two elements, A fluctuating between sun and moon, Sun and Moon comprise an important polarity for Stevens. according to Edward Kessler, who also picks out North and South, Music and the Sea, the Statue and the Wilderness, and Colors and \\"Domination of Black\\". At least as controversial as the question about symbolism is whether and how Stevens' personal life should be read into his poetry. William Carlos Williams was not reluctant to do so, writing some months after Stevens' death, \\"He was a dandy at heart. You never saw Stephens in sloppy clothes. His poems are the result.\\"Bates, p. 90. The remarkable \\"Le Monocle de Mon Oncle\\" is particularly disputed with regard to the relevance of the biographical. Referring to the fact that Stevens' marriage to Elsie turned cold, Milton Bates writes, \\"Emotional deprivation became to some extent the condition of his craft, the somber backdrop for the motley antics of Harmonium.\\"Bates, p. 82. (\\"Monocle\\" may be compared to \\"From the Misery of Don Joost\\".) To balance the ledger, the love poem \\"Jasmine's Beautiful Thoughts Underneath The Willow\\" may be contrasted with \\"Monocle\\". Another dimension of deprivation to be taken into account is addressed by Stevens in \\"The Place of the Solitaires\\" which touches on the solitary discipline of writing poetry. See also \\"Two Figures In Dense Violet Night\\" which can be read as a humorous anecdote about the gauche male, or a meditation on the lover's otherness, or the poet's challenge to the imagination of the reader. As Vendler notes in a discussion of the fluidity of self-reference in Stevens, the impersonal \\"one\\" is sometimes favored over \\"I\\" in order to enable disclosure of suffering: \\"One has a malady, here, a malady\\".Vendler 2007, p. 134 And he often refers to himself in the third- person as part of an effort to see himself from the outside: \\"When this yokel comes maundering\\". However, note the use of the first-person in \\"The Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad\\". Although Stevens held that \\"All of our ideas come from the natural world: Trees = Umbrellas\\",Kermode and Richardson, p. 903. his imagination revealed nature as enigmatic. Bates notes that many of Stevens' images and symbols \\"combine clarity with an air of mystery\\".Buttel, p. 122 \\"The Public Square\\" illustrates this quality. Buttel explains this mysterious naturalism as Stevens' response to the ethos of the Symbolists which brought him to take his earlier transcendentalist leanings, towards a union of nature and the ideal, \\"in the direction of the dark and mysterious\\".Buttel, p. 122. He was led to become urgently concerned with conveying the indefinable in the poem itself. \\"The Curtains in the House of the Metaphysician\\" is as good an example as any. He redirects the longing to know a transcendent realm into nature itself, salving the frustrated platonic desire with his poetic gifts, notably the non-discursive effects borrowed from sound and sight, music and painting. He is ironic, as in \\"Invective Against Swans\\" and \\"Anatomy of Monotony\\", about the 'spiritual' demand to transcend nature. Another aspect of Stevens' naturalism is his close attention to the perceptual act, particularly as not simply mirroring reality but rather as disclosing it in this or that creative aspect. This is arguably the subject of \\"Tattoo\\". There is an issue about whether Stevens converted to Christianity on his deathbed but his poetry predominantly expresses a naturalistic outlook in which the religious longing for eternal bliss is channeled into a poetic response to nature. \\"Lunar Paraphrase\\" can be read as such a response, despite its mention of religious figures. This reading would support what he wrote in Adagia: \\"After one has abandoned a belief in god, poetry is that essence which takes its place as life's redemption\\".Kermode and Richardson, p. 901. This enigmatic naturalism is given graceful and elegiac expression in \\"Sunday Morning\\". Stevens' skepticism about an afterlife is evident in \\"Of Heaven Considered as a Tomb\\". The finality of death is given emphatic expression in \\"Cort√®ge for Rosenbloom\\". \\"Negation\\"'s witty depiction of God as a bungling potter indicates that the Deity didn't have a place in Stevens' belief system. In a letter written in 1933 Stevens selects \\"The Emperor of Ice Cream\\" as his favorite among his poems because it contains something of \\"the essential gaudiness of poetry\\". (Later, in 1939, he wrote a letter expressing fondness for \\"Fabliau of Florida\\".) The gaudiness of color images is striking in such poems as \\"Domination of Black\\" and \\"Disillusionment of Ten O'Clock\\" which also associate Stevens with the imagist movement in early twentieth-century art. There may be a link between the gaudiness of poetry and the title of the book. His original choice was The Grand Poem: Preliminary Minutiae but he may have chosen the title Harmonium for its eponymous relation to a harmonium‚Äîthat is, a gaudy little organ-like calliope, suggesting Calliope, muse of poetry. Note also the Adagia thesis that words are \\"the only melodeon\\".Kermode and Richardson, p. 909 The gaudiness of Stevens' poetry endears him to many, even those who, with a wink, profess to be among his enemies. It has earned him the sobriquet \\"the Matisse of poets\\". Buttel particularly, with reference to \\"Sunday Morning\\" and Matisse's Odalisque paintings, is insistent on Stevens and Matisse as kindred spirits. Others are impressed by his affinity with Klee, viewing Stevens as sharing Klee's delight in the playful and evocative ways in which a minimal use of color and scene could create much larger panoramas. \\"The colors and linear forms in Stevens' poetry evoke images that dance and tease the imagination\\", Feinstein writes, \\"in much the same way as the visual images in Klee's paintings\\".Feinstein, p. 64 Marianne Moore favored a comparison to Rousseau, likening the effect that Stevens was trying to achieve with \\"Rousseau's paintings of banana leaves and alligators\\".quoted in Richardson, p. 31 \\"Floral Decorations for Bananas\\" nicely illustrates Moore's comparison. Another example of the painterly virtues of Stevens' Harmonium poems is \\"The Apostrophe to Vincentine\\" which Buttel views as an instance of Stevens' practice of evoking reality through resemblances between the world and the visual or tactile qualities of paintings.Buttel, p. 150. See the linked poem and commentary for elaboration. Another example is Explanation and its allusion to Chagall. The critic Paul Rosenfeld described Stevens as \\"the musical imagist\\".Rosenfeld, p. 152 \\"To The One Of Fictive Music\\" is one deep and difficult justification for this description, invoking the muse of poetry for \\"an image that is sure\\" in a kind of music that \\"gives motion to perfection more serene\\" than other forms of music summoned by the human condition. This primacy is given an exaggerated statement in the Adagia aphorism, \\"Words are the only melodeon\\". Stevens might also be called the Vivaldi of poets because of the importance to him of the seasons and weather generally. Harold Bloom chides Vendler for writing in On Extended Wings that \\"the only phenomenon to which he [Stevens] is passionately attached is the weather\\", replying, \\"If Mrs. Vendler were wholly correct, readers deeply moved by Stevens might have to murmur that never has so much been made out of the weather.\\"See \\"The Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad\\" for one resolution of this difference about the weather. Responding to the seasons, nature, and the world generally is the work of the imagination, whether the poet's or anyone else's, and failure of imagination is associated with death, as in \\"Another Weeping Woman\\". The seasons also serve for Stevens' musings on the passage of time, as in \\"The Man whose Pharynx was bad\\". Sebastian Gardner shows that the four seasons can be understood as fundamental to Stevens' poetic project, and that a corresponding philosophical project is implicit in his work, assigning different metaphysical import to the aspects of reality brought out in the poetry of each of the seasons.S. Gardner, 1994 The Vivaldi of poets has also been accused of \\"some hazy notion of an analogy between music and poetry\\". Whether hazy or not, the notion colors such poems as Harmoniums \\"Peter Quince at the Clavier\\" and \\"Infanta Marina\\", which Vendler likens to a \\"double scherzo\\". She also observes that for Stevens \\"looking and hearing, imagery and musicality, occupy equal ground\\".Vendler, p. 48. Essayist Llewelyn Powys also pursues this notion, finding that \\"each unexpected verbal manipulation conceals some obscure harmony of sense and sound which not only provokes intellectual appreciation, but in the strangest possible way troubles the imagination\\".Powrys, p. 46 Anca Rosu gives priority to sound: \\"To Plato's metaphysics of sight Stevens responds with a metaphysics of sound.\\"Ancu, p. xiii See Michael O. Stegman's \\"Checklist of Musical Compositions Relating to Stevens\\" for a considerable number of musical tributes to Stevens, such as John Gardner's \\"Five Partsongs to Poems by Wallace Stevens\\". Stevens the ironist should not be overlooked. Irony (arguably) suffuses \\"The Ordinary Women\\", \\"Invective Against Swans\\", \\"Nuances of a Theme by Williams\\" and other poems in Harmonium. Also a sense of humor is a significant characteristic of the collection, as indicated by many of the poem titles and in some cases by the content as well. Both title and content of \\"Cy Est Pourtraicte, Madame Ste Ursule, et Les Unze Mille Vierges\\" testify to this lighter side. Samuel French Morse, who categorized the years 1914‚Äì1930 as the Harmonium years, wrote that nothing Stevens was to write later would achieve \\"the particular comic quality of these early exercises\\" in Harmonium, though the tone of the poetry would deepen.Morse, p. 33. Even Stevens' experimentation with perspective, coolly executed in \\"The Snow Man\\", is presented with bawdy humor in a poem like \\"A High-Toned Old Christian Woman\\". One vein of Stevens' poetic humour expresses his reaction against the conventions of the Victorian tradition. \\"Depression Before Spring\\" for instance refuses to gush about spring as a season of renewal; it compares a fair maiden's flaxen hair to cow spit; and it introduces such \\"unpoetic\\" lines as \\"Ho! Ho!\\" and > But ki-ki-ri-ki Briings no rou-cou No rou-cou-cou. Another aspect of Stevens' sense of humor is the cleverness of such poems as \\"Anecdote of Canna\\" and \\"Hymn From a Watermelon Pavilion\\" which subtly exploit within-a-dream scenarios. Stevens seems to have attempted to achieve a balance between somber and light in the Harmonium collection. For instance, though most of the fourteen poems introduced in the second (1931) edition, like \\"Sea Surface full of Clouds\\", are somber, \\"The Revolutionists stop for Orangeade\\" is light. In the ancient quarrel between poetic imagination and philosophical reason, Stevens sides with the former, though he emphasizes not an unchanging mental faculty but rather the continual work of imaginative reconstruction of the material the world provides‚Äîturning ever-changing shades of green into ever-changing shades of blue, so to speak. One of Stevens' themes is the contrast between an imaginative, poetic disclosure of reality as opposed to rationalist abstraction. See for example \\"On the Manner of Addressing Clouds\\". Stevens defends the sensuous ground he favors against the philosophers' Plato in \\"Homunculus et la Belle Etoile\\", contrasting and recommending instead \\"the ultimate Plato\\". Despite Stevens' commitment to this theme, interpreters have not been prevented from exploring the philosophical implications of his poetry. A few poems from Harmonium, on no account excluding \\"The Comedian as the Letter C\\", \\"O Florida, Venereal Soil\\", \\"Bantams in Pine Woods\\", \\"Palace of the Babies\\" and \\"Theory\\" are occasionally mentioned as examples of pataphysics, an attempt to go beyond metaphysics that is sometimes cited as responsible for the high tides of language in Stevens' poetry. It has also been read as expressing philosophies as various as Santayana's, Nietzsche's and Kant's. (See \\"The Snow Man\\" and \\"Gubbinal\\" for some references.) Many would agree with Simon Critchley, who favors a broadly Kantian reading, that Stevens was the philosophically most important poet writing in English in the twentieth century. Anca Rosu reads Stevens as claiming poetry as a way of thinking and reaching for the knowledge usually associated with philosophy. This brings him close to Martin Heidegger, she writes, but \\"the notable difference is that while Heidegger's passion for poetry threatens his profession‚Äîphilosophy, as it has traditionally been understood‚Äîwith its end, Stevens, being a poet, can only triumph in the triumph of poetry\\".Ancu, p. xiv She finds deeper philosophical affinities between Stevens and the American philosophers William James and George Santayana \\"who themselves challenged the tenets of traditional philosophy by stressing the cultural construction of such notions as reality, truth, and knowledge\\".Acu, p. xiv She emphasizes that Stevens' purpose is not to replace philosophy with poetry but \\"to enhance the poetic and endow it with philosophical import\\". As for Earthy Anecdote, Vendler believes that \\"this apparently trivial little poem\\" revealed to Stevens how much his art depended on obstructions and the consequent swerves they provoked. On the other (dramatically different) hand, Nicholson reads it as an anecdote about planet Earth. The bucks are spinning planets and the firecat is the Sun‚Äîso the poem's title is a pun. Stevens is on record as saying that he \\"intended something quite concrete: actual animals, not original chaos\\", commenting on Walter Pach's illustration for his poem, which he judged \\"just the opposite of my idea\\".Steven, H. Letter to Carl Zigrosser, July 10, 1918. p. 209 If chaos is just the opposite of his idea, Nicholson's astronomical interpretation might fall under the same censure, and perhaps Vendler's \\"poet's struggles\\" reading as well. Martha Strom's approach may be more in line with Stevens' idea. She explains the position of the poem at the beginning of Harmonium as signifying Stevens' departure from the dominant 'local' school, which enjoined the poet to stay close to his roots and locale. She writes, > Stevens locates the bucks in Oklahoma, which firmly situates the poem in the > \\"local\\" school of writing, but he imbues the localist donn√©e ‚Äî a particular > landscape, some bucks, and a cat in Oklahoma ‚Äî with the motion of his > imagination, and the flat \\"local\\" scene acquires texture and life.Strom, p. > 429 She quotes from an editorial on 'Local Color' that Stevens wrote in 1900 while an undergraduate at Harvard and president of The Harvard Advocate, proposing that Stevens' interest in overcoming locality can be traced back to those days. > So many of the stories submitted to us of late have had their scenes laid in > and about the College...that a word in regard to local color may not be out > of place. It is of course possible for an amusing event to take place in the > Yard....But because an event does take place in the Yard does not make it > amusing....Nevertheless it seems to be a popular fallacy with a great many > contributors that it is only necessary to stay within the shadow of the > dormitories to write an entertaining story or poem.Strom, p. 132 This departure from the strictures of \\"locality\\" reaches a fulfillment in the final poem that Stevens wrote for Harmonium, \\"The Comedian as the Letter C\\", in which the poet voyages away from his local soil into a sea of poetic possibilities that, he supposes, will occasion his artistic growth. However, Crispin is left there at an impasse, frustrated in his hope to find roots in some locale or other. One reading of \\"Tea at the Palaz of Hoon\\" is that it anticipates the direction that Stevens would take in the thirties, towards a pure poetry that would be independent of locale.

See Buttel, p. 76. See also Librivox This poem must be \\"some sort of manifesto\\", Helen Vendler speculates, \\"but of what was it the proclamation?\\" Similar puzzles surround the second poem in Harmonium, \\"Invective Against Swans\\". Why would Stevens write an insult poem attacking swans? Why the aspic nipple in the third poem, \\"In the Carolinas\\"? What manner of nude \\"scuds the glitters\\" on a weed, as in \\"The Paltry Nude Starts on a Spring Voyage\\"? Who is the giant in \\"The Plot Against the Giant\\" and why can he be undone by heavenly labials? What is a \\"Gubbinal\\"? Why does the listener in \\"The Snow Man\\" become \\"nothing himself\\" and behold \\"the nothing that is\\"? Is \\"The Emperor of Ice Cream\\" simply a nonsense ditty or does it have some discursive meaning? Is Crispin's voyage in \\"The Comedian as the Letter C\\" a success or a failure? What is the mistake that Caliper makes in \\"Last Looks at the Lilacs\\" when he scratches his buttocks and tells the divine ingenue that the bloom of lilacs is the fragrance of vegetal? Should the reader be amused or appalled by the remarkable funeral procession in \\"The Worms at Heaven's Gate\\"? The Collected Poems edition (1954) When Stevens republished Harmonium in 1954 as part of his Collected Poems, he used the 1931 edition as the basis. He did however make some changes. The final two poems of the 1923 edition were moved to the end of the book, so that they followed the 1931 additions. The poem titled \\"Of the Manner of Addressing Clouds\\" was, in this later edition retitled \\"On the Manner of Addressing Clouds\\" and the poem \\"Valley Candle\\" was added to the book between \\"The Jack-Rabbit\\" and \\"Anecdote of Men by the Thousand\\".https://the- eye.eu/public/Books/Poetry/Wallace%20Stevens%20-%20The%20Collected%20Poems.pdf Footnotes References * Axelrod, Steven Gould, and Helen Deese.

That year, Ruth hit a then-league record 29 home runs, a spectacular feat at that time. Teams played in spacious ball parks that limited hitting for power, and, compared to modern baseballs, the ball used then was \\"dead\\" both by design and from overuse. In addition ball scuffing and adulteration by pitchers was not against the rules during this period. This era was characterized by low- scoring games and a lack of home runs. The lowest league run average in history was in 1908, when teams averaged only 3.4 runs per game.  Baseball during the dead-ball era  Dead-ball era slugging average (highlighted area, 1900‚Äì1918 inclusive) and contributions from (top to bottom) home runs (HR), triples (3B), doubles (2B), and singles (1B) Dead-ball era runs scored per game (highlighted area, 1900‚Äì1918 inclusive) During the dead-ball era, baseball was much more of a strategy-driven game, using a style of play now known as small ball or inside baseball. It relied much more on plays such as the stolen bases and hit-and-run than on home runs.Daniel Okrent, Harris Lewine, David Nemec (2000) The Ultimate Baseball Book, Houghton Mifflin Books, p. 3 These strategies emphasized speed, perhaps by necessity. Low-power hits like the Baltimore Chop, developed in the 1890s by the Baltimore Orioles, were used to get on base.Burt Solomon (2000) Where They Ain't: The Fabled Life And Untimely Death Of The Original Baltimore Orioles, Simon and Schuster, Excerpt Once on base, a runner would often steal or be bunted over to second base and move to third base or score on a hit-and-run play. In no other era have teams stolen as many bases as in the dead-ball era. On 13 occasions between and , the league leader in home runs had fewer than 10 home runs for the season; on four occasions the league leaders had 20 or more home runs. Meanwhile, there were 20 instances where the league leader in triples had 20 or more. Owen \\"Chief\\" Wilson set a record of 36 triples in 1912, a record that is likely one of baseball's unbreakable records, as is that of the 309 career triples of Sam Crawford set during this time.Year-by-Year League Leaders & Records, Baseball- Reference.com Despite their speed, teams struggled to score during the dead- ball era. Major league cumulative batting averages ranged in the National League and in the American League. The lack of power in the game also meant lower slugging averages and on-base percentages, as pitchers could challenge hitters more without the threat of the home run. The nadir of the dead-ball era was around and , with a league-wide batting average , slugging average , and ERA under 2.40. In the latter year, the Chicago White Sox hit three home runs for the entire season, yet they finished 88‚Äì64, just a couple of games from winning the pennant.League Index Season to Season League Statistical Totals , Baseball-Reference.com Some players and fans complained about the low-scoring games, and baseball sought to remedy the situation. In , Ben Shibe invented the cork-centered ball, which the Reach Company‚Äîofficial ball supplier to the American League (AL)‚Äîbegan marketing. Spalding, who supplied the National League (NL), followed with its own cork-center ball. The change in the ball dramatically affected play in both leagues. In , the American League batting average ; in 1911, it rose . The National League saw a jump in the league batting average in 1910 in . The season happened to be the best of Ty Cobb's career; he with 248 hits. Joe Jackson in 1911, and the next year Cobb . These were the averages between and . In , however, minor league pitcher Russ Ford noticed that a ball scuffed against a concrete wall quickly dived as it reached the batter. This so-called emery pitch, together with the spitball, gave pitchers greatly increased control of the batter, especially since a single ballrarely replaced during a gamewould become increasingly scuffed as play progressed, as well as more difficult to see as it became dirtier. By run scoring was essentially back to the pre-1911 years and remained so until 1919.Timothy A. Johnson (2004) Baseball and the Music of Charles Ives: A Proving Ground, Scarecrow Press, Excerpt p. 28 In this era, Frank Baker earned the nickname \\"Home Run\\" Baker merely for hitting two home runs in the 1911 World Series; although he led the American League in home runs four times (1911‚Äì1914), his highest home run season was 1913, when he hit 12 home runs, and he finished with 96 home runs for his career. The best homerun hitter of the dead-ball era was Philadelphia Phillies outfielder \\"Cactus\\" Gavvy Cravath. He led the National League in home runs six times, with a high total of 24 for the pennant-winning Phillies in and seasons of 19 home runs each in 1913 and 1914. However, Cravath played in the Baker Bowl, a notoriously hitter-friendly park with only a short distance from the plate to the right field wall.  Contributing factors  The following factors contributed to the dramatic decline in runs scored during the dead-ball era: = Foul strike rule = The foul strike rule was a major rule change that, in just a few years, sent baseball from a high-scoring game to a game where scoring any runs was a struggle. Under the foul strike rule, a batter who fouls off is charged with a strike unless he already has two strikes against him. The National League adopted the foul strike rule in 1901 and the American League followed suit in 1903. Prior to this rule, foul balls did not count as strikes. Thus, a batter could foul off a countless number of pitches with no strikes counted against him‚Äîexcept for bunt attempts. This gave batters an enormous advantage before the foul strike rule removed it. Baseball Reference Bullpen Foul strike rule, Baseball-Reference.com = Ball construction and use = Before 1921, it was common for a baseball to be in play for over 100 pitches. Players used the same ball until it started to unravel. Early baseball leagues were very cost-conscious, so fans had to throw back balls that had been hit into the stands. The longer the ball was in play, the softer it became‚Äîand hitting a heavily used, softer ball for distance is much more difficult than hitting a new, harder one. The ball was also softer to begin with, making home runs less likely. = Spitball = The ball was also hard to hit because pitchers could manipulate it before a pitch. For example, the spitball pitch was permitted in baseball until 1921. Pitchers often marked the ball, scuffed it, spat on it‚Äîanything they could to influence the ball's motion. This made the ball \\"dance\\" and curve much more than it does now, making it more difficult to hit. Tobacco juice was often added to the ball as well, which discolored it. This made the ball difficult to see, especially since baseball parks did not have lights until the late 1930s. This made both hitting and fielding more difficult. = Ballpark size = Many ballparks were large by modern standards, such as the West Side Grounds of the Chicago Cubs, which was to the center field fence, and the Huntington Avenue Grounds of the Boston Red Sox, which was to the center field fence. The dimensions of Braves Field prompted Ty Cobb to say that no one would ever hit the ball out of it.  End of the era  The dead-ball era ended suddenly. By 1921, offenses were scoring 40% more runs and hitting four times as many home runs as they had in 1918. Baseball historians debate the abruptness of this change, with no consensus on its cause. Six popular theories have been advanced: * Changes in the ball: This theory claims that owners replaced the ball with a newer, livelier ball (sometimes referred to as the \\"jackrabbit\\" ball), presumably with the intention of boosting offense and, by extension, ticket sales. The theory has been rebutted by Major League Baseball. The yarn used to wrap the core of the ball was changed prior to the 1920 season, although testing by the United States Bureau of Standards found no difference in the physical properties of the two different types of balls. The so-called \\"livelier\\" ball was actually introduced in 1911, when the league began using a cork-centered ball, as opposed to rubber, and that year the number of total home runs was 514, having been 361 the previous season. Frank Schulte became the first player of the 20th century to reach twenty home runs in a season. * Outlawing certain pitches: Pitches now considered illegal, per MLB Rule 6.02(c), were outlawed. This included the shine ball, emery ball, and spitball (a very effective pitch throughout the dead-ball era). This theory states that without such effective pitches in the pitcher's arsenal, batters gained an advantage. When the spitball was outlawed in 1920, MLB recognized seventeen pitchers who had nearly built their careers specializing in the spitball and permitted them to continue using it; the last pitcher allowed to do so, Burleigh Grimes, pitched until the end of 1934. * More baseballs per game: The fatal beaning of Ray Chapman during the 1920 season led to a rule that the baseball must be replaced every time that it got dirty. With a clean ball in play at all times, players no longer had to contend with a ball that \\"traveled through the air erratically, tended to soften in the later innings, and as it came over the plate, was very hard to see.\\"Baseball: An Illustrated History. Geoffrey C. Ward and Ken Burns, 1994. * Stat keeping and rule changes: In 1920, Major League Baseball adopted writer Fred Lieb's proposal that a game-winning home run with men on base count as a home run, even if its run is not needed to win the game. Owners tried unsuccessfully to eliminate the intentional walk. They succeeded only in changing the rules to require that the catcher be within the catcher's box when the pitcher throws‚Äö and that everything that happened in a protested game was added to the game record. (From 1910 to 1919‚Äö records in protested games were excluded.) * Babe Ruth: One theory is that the prolific success of Babe Ruth at hitting home runs led players around the league to forsake their old methods of hitting (described above) and adopt a \\"free- swinging\\" style designed to hit the ball hard and with an uppercut stroke, with the intention of hitting more home runs. Critics of this theory claim that it does not account for the improvement in batting averages from 1918 to 1921, over which time the league average improved . * Ballpark dimensions: This theory contends that offensive success came from changes in the dimensions of the ballparks. Accurate estimates of ballpark sizes of the era can be difficult to find, however, so there is disagreement over whether the dimensions changed at all, let alone whether the change led to improved offense. A 1920 season rule change stated that balls hit over the fence in fair territory but landing foul were fair, and hence home runs rather than foul balls.

Also suppose œá is invariant under the Z2 parity (nothing to do with spatial reflections!) mapping œá to ‚àíœá but leaving œÜ invariant. Obviously, free field theories always satisfy this property. Then, the Z2 parity of the number of œá particles is well defined and is conserved in time (even though the number of œá particles itself depends on the choice of which splitting into a free Hamiltonian and an interacting Hamiltonian we make in the interaction picture, which doesn't even exist for interacting theories (the number is typically infinite)). Let's denote this parity by the operator Kœá which maps œá-even states to itself and œá-odd states into their negative. Then, Kœá is involutive, Hermitian and unitary. Needless to say, the fields œÜ and œá above don't have the proper statistics relations for either a boson or a fermion. i.e. they are bosonic with respect to themselves but fermionic with respect to each other. But if you look at the statistical properties alone, we find it has exactly the same statistics as the Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics. Here's why: Define two new fields œÜ' and œá' as follows: :\\\\varphi'=iK_{\\\\chi}\\\\varphi\\\\, and :\\\\chi'=K_{\\\\chi}\\\\chi.\\\\, This redefinition is invertible (because Kœá is).

By extension, language extinction is when the language is no longer known, including by second-language speakers. Other similar terms include linguicide,Zuckermann, Ghil'ad, \\"Stop, revive and survive\\", The Australian Higher Education, June 6, 2012. the death of a language from natural or political causes, and rarely glottophagy,Calvet, Jean-Louis. 1974. Langue et colonialisme: petit trait√© de glottophagie. Paris. the absorption or replacement of a minor language by a major language. Language death is a process in which the level of a speech community's linguistic competence in their language variety decreases, eventually resulting in no native or fluent speakers of the variety. Language death can affect any language form, including dialects. Language death should not be confused with language attrition (also called language loss), which describes the loss of proficiency in a first language of an individual.Crystal, David (2000) Language Death. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. p. 19 In the modern period (c. 1500 CE‚Äìpresent; following the rise of colonialism), language death has typically resulted from the process of cultural assimilation leading to language shift and the gradual abandonment of a native language in favour of a foreign lingua franca, largely those of European countries. As of the 2000s, a total of roughly 7,000 natively spoken languages existed worldwide. Most of these are minor languages in danger of extinction; one estimate published in 2004 expected that some 90% of the currently spoken languages will have become extinct by 2050. . Ethnologue records 7,358 living languages known, but on 2015-05-20, Ethnologue reported only 7,102 known living languages; and on 2015-02-23, Ethnologue already reported only 7,097 known living languages. Types Language death is typically the final outcome of language shift and may manifest itself in one of the following ways: * Gradual language death: slowly, over a period of time * Bottom-to-top language death: cessation of the use of language except in special circumstances (e.g. liturgical language) * Top-to-bottom language death: when language shift begins in a high-level environment such as the government. * Radical language death: the disappearance of a language when all speakers of the language cease to speak the language * Linguicide (also known as sudden death, language genocide, physical language death, biological language death) * Language attrition: the loss of proficiency in a language at the individual level The most common process leading to language death is one in which a community of speakers of one language becomes bilingual with another language, and gradually shifts allegiance to the second language until they cease to use their original, heritage language. This is a process of assimilation which may be voluntary or may be forced upon a population. Speakers of some languages, particularly regional or minority languages, may decide to abandon them based on economic or utilitarian grounds, in favor of languages regarded as having greater utility or prestige. Languages with a small, geographically isolated population of speakers can die when their speakers are wiped out by genocide, disease, or natural disaster.  Definition A language is often declared to be dead even before the last native speaker of the language has died. If there are only a few elderly speakers of a language remaining, and they no longer use that language for communication, then the language is effectively dead. A language that has reached such a reduced stage of use is generally considered moribund. Half of the spoken languages of the world are not being taught to new generations of children. Once a language is no longer a native language‚Äîthat is, if no children are being socialized into it as their primary language‚Äîthe process of transmission is ended and the language itself will not survive past the current generations. Language death is rarely a sudden event, but a slow process of each generation learning less and less of the language, until its use is relegated to the domain of traditional use, such as in poetry and song. Typically the transmission of the language from adults to children becomes more and more restricted, to the final setting that adults speaking the language will raise children who never acquire fluency. One example of this process reaching its conclusion is that of the Dalmatian language. Consequences on grammar During language loss‚Äîsometimes referred to as obsolescence in the linguistic literature‚Äîthe language that is being lost generally undergoes changes as speakers make their language more similar to the language that they are shifting to. This process of change has been described by Appel (1983) in two categories, though they are not mutually exclusive. Often speakers replace elements of their own language with something from the language they are shifting toward. Also, if their heritage language has an element that the new language does not, speakers may drop it. * overgeneralization; * undergeneralization; * loss of phonological contrasts; * variability; * changes in word order; * morphological loss, such as was seen in Scottish Gaelic in East Sutherland, Scotland (Dorian: 1978) as fluent speakers still used the historic plural formation, whereas semi-speakers used simple suffixation or did not include any plural formation at all; * synthetic morphosyntax may become increasingly analytic; * syntactic loss (i.e. lexical categories, complex constructions); * relexification; * loss of word-formation productivity; * style loss, such as the loss of ritual speech; * morphological leveling; * analogical leveling. Language revitalization Language revitalization is an attempt to slow or reverse language death. Revitalization programs are ongoing in many languages, and have had varying degrees of success. The revival of the Hebrew language in Israel is the only example of a language's acquiring new first language speakers after it became extinct in everyday use for an extended period, being used only as a liturgical language.Hinton, Leanne; & Hale, Ken (eds.). 2001. The Green Book of Language Revitalization in Practice. San Diego: Academic Press. Even in the case of Hebrew, there is a theory that argues that \\"the Hebrew revivalists who wished to speak pure Hebrew failed. The result is a fascinating and multifaceted Israeli language, which is not only multi-layered but also multi-sourced. The revival of a clinically dead language is unlikely without cross-fertilization from the revivalists' mother tongue(s).\\"Zuckermann, Ghil'ad, \\"Aboriginal languages deserve revival\\" , The Australian Higher Education, August 26, 2009. Other cases of language revitalization which have seen some degree of success are Irish, Welsh, Hawaiian, Cherokee and Navajo. As a response to English linguistic dominance, de-anglicisation became a matter of national pride in some places and especially in regions that were once under colonial rule, where vestiges of colonial domination are a sensitive subject. Following centuries of English rule in Ireland and English imposition of the English language, an argument for de-anglicization was delivered before the Irish National Literary Society in Dublin, 25 November 1892; \\"When we speak of 'The Necessity for De-Anglicising the Irish Nation', we mean it, not as a protest against imitating what is best in the English people, for that would be absurd, but rather to show the folly of neglecting what is Irish, and hastening to adopt, pell-mell, and indiscriminately, everything that is English, simply because it is English.\\" Language was one of the features of Anglicisation in Ireland: although it never died out and became an official language after independence, Irish had lost its status as the island's principal vernacular to become a minority language during the period of British rule; similarly, in North America indigenous languages have been replaced by those of the colonists. According to Ghil'ad Zuckermann, \\"language reclamation will become increasingly relevant as people seek to recover their cultural autonomy, empower their spiritual and intellectual sovereignty, and improve wellbeing. There are various ethical, aesthetic and utilitarian benefits of language revival‚Äîfor example, historical justice, diversity and employability, respectively.\\"  Factors that prevent language death  Google launched the Endangered Languages Project aimed at helping preserve languages that are at risk of extinction. Its goal is to compile up-to-date information about endangered languages and share the latest research about them. Anthropologist Akira Yamamoto has identified nine factors that he believes will help prevent language death: # There must be a dominant culture that favors linguistic diversity # The endangered community must possess an ethnic identity that is strong enough to encourage language preservation # The creation and promotion of programs that educate students on the endangered language and culture # The creation of school programs that are both bilingual and bicultural # For native speakers to receive teacher training # The endangered speech community must be completely involved # There must be language materials created that are easy to use # The language must have written materials that encompass new and traditional content # The language must be used in new environments and the areas the language is used (both old and new) must be strengthened Dead languages  Linguists distinguish between language \\"death\\" and the process where a language becomes a \\"dead language\\" through normal language change, a linguistic phenomenon analogous to pseudoextinction. This happens when a language in the course of its normal development gradually morphs into something that is then recognized as a separate, different language, leaving the old form with no native speakers. Thus, for example, Old English may be regarded as a \\"dead language\\" although it changed and developed into Middle English, Early Modern English and Modern English. Dialects of a language can also die, contributing to the overall language death. For example, the Ainu language is slowly dying - \\"The UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger lists Hokkaido Ainu as critically endangered with 15 speakers ... and both Sakhalin and Kuril Ainu as extinct.\\"  Language change  The process of language change may also involve the splitting up of a language into a family of several daughter languages, leaving the common parent language \\"dead\\". This has happened to Latin, which (through Vulgar Latin) eventually developed into the Romance languages, and to Prakrit, which developed into the New Indo-Aryan languages. Such a process is normally not described as \\"language death\\", because it involves an unbroken chain of normal transmission of the language from one generation to the next, with only minute changes at every single point in the chain. Thus with regard to Latin, for example, there is no point at which Latin \\"died\\"; it evolved in different ways in different geographic areas, and its modern forms are now identified by a plethora of different names such as French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Romanian, Catalan, Galician, Sardinian, Venetian, etc. Measuring language vitality Except in case of linguicide, languages do not suddenly become extinct; they become moribund as the community of speakers gradually shifts to using other languages. As speakers shift, there are discernible, if subtle, changes in language behavior. These changes in behavior lead to a change of linguistic vitality in the community. There are a variety of systems that have been proposed for measuring the vitality of a language in a community. One of the earliest is GIDS (Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale) proposed by Joshua Fishman in 1991.Fishman, Joshua. 1991. Reversing Language Shift. Clevendon: Multilingual Matters. A noteworthy publishing milestone in measuring language vitality is an entire issue of Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development devoted to the study of ethnolinguistic vitality, Vol. 32.2, 2011, with several authors presenting their own tools for measuring language vitality. A number of other published works on measuring language vitality have been published, prepared by authors with varying situations and applications in mind.

History  A bridge over the koi pond Red-eared slider turtle and Koi at Hakone Building at Hakone In 1915, two San Francisco arts patrons, Oliver and Isabel Stine, intending to build a summer retreat, purchased the site on which Hakone now stands. Inspired by her trips to Japan, Isabel Stine modeled the gardens upon (and named them after) Fuji- Hakone-Izu National Park. She hired Japanese landscape artists and architects to design the gardens and the Upper \\"Moon Viewing\\" House. In 1932, ownership passed to financier Major C. L. Tilden who added the main gate to the gardens. When he died, Hakone was inherited by his sister, Mrs. Walter Gregory. After her death in 1959, Hakone was left untended, and the property was put up for sale. In 1961, Joseph and Clara Gresham, their son Eldon and wife Deon, and four Chinese American couples: George and Marie Hall, Johnny Kan and Helen Kan, Dan and June Lee, Col. John C. Young and Mary Lee Young purchased the estate. This partnership restored Hakone to its original splendor, keeping its traditional Japanese authenticity while using it as a private retreat. In 1966, the partners offered a beautifully maintained Hakone for sale to the City of Saratoga. Today Hakone is administered by The Hakone Foundation, a non-profit organization, which was established in 2000 to restore and enhance the gardens independently of public funding. The gardens are open to the public and the various community facilities are often used for cultural events. =Film History= Hakone Gardens was a filming location for the movie Memoirs of a Geisha (2005).

Often, languages that are perceived to be higher status stabilise or spread at the expense of other languages that are perceived by their own speakers to be lower-status. An example is the shift from Gaulish to Latin during the time of the Roman Empire. Mechanisms =Prehistory= For prehistory, Forster et al. (2004) and Forster and Renfrew (2011) observe that there is a correlation of language shift with intrusive male Y chromosomes but not necessarily with intrusive female mtDNA. They conclude that technological innovation (the transition from hunting-gathering to farming, or from stone to metal tools) or military prowess (as in the abduction of British women by Vikings to Iceland) causes immigration of at least some men, who are perceived to be of higher status than local men. Then, in mixed-language marriages, children would speak the \\"higher-status\\" language, yielding the language/Y-chromosome correlation seen today. Assimilation is the process whereby a speech-community becomes bilingual and gradually shifts allegiance to the second language. The rate of assimilation is the percentage of the speech-community that speaks the second language more often at home. The data are used to measure the use of a given language in the lifetime of a person, or most often across generations. When a speech-community ceases to use their original language, language death is said to occur. =Indo-European migrations= In the context of the Indo-European migrations, it has been noted that small groups can change a larger cultural area. Michael Witzel refers to Ehret's model \\"which stresses the osmosis, or a \\"billiard ball,\\" or Mallory's Kulturkugel, effect of cultural transmission.\\" According to Ehret, ethnicity and language can shift with relative ease in small societies, due to the cultural, economic and military choices made by the local population in question. The group bringing new traits may initially be small, contributing features that can be fewer in number than those of the already local culture. The emerging combined group may then initiate a recurrent, expansionist process of ethnic and language shift. David Anthony notes that the spread of the Indo-European languages probably did not happen through \\"chain-type folk migrations\\", but by the introduction of these languages by ritual and political elites, which are emulated by large groups of people. Anthony explains: Anthony gives the example of the Luo-speaking Acholi in northern Uganda in the 17th and 18th century, whose language spread rapidly in the 19th century. Anthony notes that \\"Indo-European languages probably spread in a similar way among the tribal societies of prehistoric Europe\\", carried forward by \\"Indo-European chiefs\\" and their \\"ideology of political clientage\\". Anthony notes that \\"elite recruitment\\" may be a suitable term for this system. Examples =Liturgical language= Historical examples for status shift are the early Welsh and Lutheran Bible translations, leading to the liturgical languages Welsh and Standard German thriving today. =Austria= Until the mid-19th century, southern Carinthia in Austria had an overwhelming Slovene-speaking majority: in the 1820s, around 97% of the inhabitants south of the line Villach-Klagenfurt-Diex spoke Slovene as their native language.Thomas M. Barker, The Slovene Minority of Carinthia (New York: Columbia University Press, 1984). In the course of the 19th century, this number fell significantly. By 1920, already a third of the population of the area had shifted to German as their main language of communication. After the Carinthian Plebiscite in the 1920s, and especially after World War II, most of the population shifted from Slovene to German. In the same region, today only some 13% of the people speaks Slovene, while more than 85% of the population speaks German. The figures for the whole region are equally telling: in 1818, around 35% of the population of Carinthia spoke Slovene; by 1910, this number fell to 15.6% and by 2001 to 2.3%.Matja≈æ Klemenƒçiƒç and Vladimir Klemenƒçiƒç, The Endeavors of Carinthian Slovenes for their Ethnic Survival with/against Austrian Governments after World War II (Klagenfurt-Ljubljana-Vienna: Mohorjeva zalo≈æba/Hermagoras Verlag, 2008). These changes were almost entirely the result of a language shift in the population, with emigration and genocide (by the Nazis during World War II) playing only a minor role. =Belarus= Despite the withdrawal of Belarus from the USSR proclaimed in 1991, use of the Belarusian language is declining. According to a study done by the Belarusian government in 2009, 72% of Belarusians speak Russian at home, and Belarusian is used by only 11.9% of Belarusians. 52.5% of Belarusians can speak and read Belarusian. Only 29.4% can speak, read and write it. According to the research, one out of ten Belarusians does not understand Belarusian. =Belgium= In the last two centuries, Brussels transformed from an exclusively Dutch-speaking city to a bilingual city with French as the majority language and lingua franca. The language shift began in the 18th century and accelerated as Belgium became independent and Brussels expanded out past its original city boundaries. \\"Wallonie - Bruxelles\\", Le Service de la langue fran√ßaise, 19/05/1997 From 1880 on, more and more Dutch-speaking people became bilingual, resulting in a rise of monolingual French-speakers after 1910. Halfway through the 20th century, the number of monolingual French-speakers began to predominate over the (mostly) bilingual Flemish inhabitants. Only since the 1960s, after the establishment of the Belgian language border and the socio-economic development of Flanders took full effect, could Dutch use stem the tide of increasing French use. French remains the city's predominant language while Dutch is spoken by a growing minority. =Canada= The use of the French language in Canada is complex. In English- speaking regions of Canada, many former Canadian French minorities have disappeared. Meanwhile in Quebec, the decline of French has been reversed and the use of English sharply declined due to high rates of emigration after the 1976 election of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois. Quebec's Eastern Townships, once predominantly English-speaking, are now overwhelmingly French-speaking. The formerly shrinking French-speaking populations in neighboring Ontario and New Brunswick have also rebounded thanks to recent immigration of French-speakers, while the use of French among native speakers is declining. =China= Historically, an important language shift in China has been the near disappearance of the Manchu language. When China was ruled by the Qing dynasty, whose Emperors were Manchu, Chinese and Manchu had co-official status, and the Emperor heavily subsidized and promoted education in Manchu, but the fact that most of the Manchu Eight Banners lived in garrisons with Mandarin speaking Han Bannermen located across Han Chinese civilian populated cities meant that most Manchus spoke the Beijing dialect of Mandarin by the 19th century and the only Manchu speakers were garrisons left in their homeland of Heilongjiang. Today there are fewer than 100 native speakers of Manchu. At the current time, language shift is occurring all across China. Many languages of minority ethnic groups are declining, as well as the many regional varieties of Chinese. Generally the shift is in favour of Standard Chinese (Mandarin), but in the province of Guangdong the cultural influence of Cantonese has meant local dialects and languages are being abandoned for Cantonese instead. ;Hong Kong In Hong Kong, Cantonese became the dominant language spoken in society since widespread immigration to Hong Kong began from the 1940s onward. With immigrants of differing mother tongues, communication was hard without a dominant language. With Cantonese originating from the capital of neighboring Canton province, Cantonese became the dominant language by extension, and other similar dialects started to vanish from use in Hong Kong. Original residents, or aboriginals, of Hong Kong used their own languages including the Tanka, Hakka and Waitau dialect, but with a majority of Hong Kong's population being immigrants by the 1940s and 50s, the dialects vanished at a rapid rate. Most of Hong Kong's younger generation does not understand, let alone speak, their ancestral dialects. Beginning in the late 1990s, since Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty, Mandarin Chinese has been more widely implemented in education and many other areas of official society. Though Mandarin Chinese has been quickly adopted into society, most Hong Kong residents would not regard it as a first language/dialect. Most Hong Kong residents prefer to communicate in Cantonese in daily life. It is natural that Mandarin Chinese speakers and Cantonese speakers could not mutually understand each other without learning the languages, due to vast difference in pronunciation, intonation, sentence structure and terminology. Furthermore, cultural difference between Hong Kong and China brings upon the variations between the Cantonese used in Hong Kong and that in Canton Province. =Egypt= In Egypt, the Coptic language, a descendant of the Afro-Asiatic Egyptian language, was in decline in usage since the time of the Arab conquest in the 7th century. By the 17th century, it was eventually supplanted as a spoken language by Egyptian Arabic. Coptic is today mainly used by the Coptic Church as a liturgical language. In the Siwa Oasis, a local variety of Berber is also used alongside Arabic. =Ethiopia= In Ethiopia, various populations of Nilotic origin have shifted languages over the centuries, adopting the idioms of their Afro-Asiatic-speaking neighbors in the northern areas. Among these groups are the Daasanach or Marille, who today speak the Daasanach language. It belongs to the Cushitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic family. However, modern genetic analysis of the Daasanach indicates that they are more closely related to Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Congo-speaking populations inhabiting Tanzania than they are to the Cushitic and Semitic Afro-Asiatic- speaking populations of Ethiopia. This suggests that the Daasanach were originally Nilo-Saharan speakers, sharing common origins with the Pokot. In the 19th century, the Nilotic ancestors of these two populations are believed to have begun separate migrations, with one group heading southwards into the African Great Lakes region and the other group settling in southern Ethiopia. There, the early Daasanach Nilotes would have come into contact with a Cushitic-speaking population, and eventually adopted this group's Afro-Asiatic language. =Finland= Finland still has coastal Swedish-speaking enclaves, unlike Estonia where the last coastal Swedes were decimated or escaped to Sweden in 1944. As Finland was under Swedish rule from the medieval ages until 1809, the language of education was Swedish, with Finnish being allowed as a medium of education at the university only in the 19th century, and the first thesis in Finnish being published in 1858. Several of the coastal cities were multilingual; Viipuri had newspapers in Swedish, Finnish, Russian and German. However, the industrialization in the prewar era and especially the postwar era and the \\"escape from the countryside\\" of the 1960s changed the demography of the major cities and led to Finnish dominating. While Helsinki was a predominantly Swedish-speaking city in 1910, the Swedish-speaking minority is now 6% of the population. =France= ;Alsace and Lorraine In Alsace, France, a longtime Alsatian-speaking region, the native Germanic dialect has been declining after a period of being banned at school by the French government after the First World War and the Second World War. It is being replaced by French.Veltman & Denis (1989) Le declin du dialecte alsacien. ;French Flanders Flemish (green) and French (red/brown) as spoken in the arrondissement of Dunkirk in 1874 and 1972. French Flanders, which gradually became part of France between 1659 and 1678, was historically part of the Dutch sprachraum, the native dialect being West Flemish (French Flemish). This is corroborated by the Dutch origin of several town names in the region, such as that of 'Dunkerque' (Dunkirk) which is a French phonetic rendition of the original Dutch name 'Duinkerke' (meaning 'church in the dunes'). The linguistic situation did not change dramatically until the French Revolution in 1789, and Dutch continued to fulfill the main functions of a cultural language throughout the 18th century. During the 19th century, especially in the second half of it, Dutch was banned from all levels of education and lost most of its functions as a cultural language. The larger cities had become predominantly French-speaking by the end of the 19th century. However, in the countryside, many elementary schools continued to teach in Dutch until World War I, and the Roman Catholic Church continued to preach and teach the catechism in Flemish in many parishes. Nonetheless, since French enjoyed a much higher status than Dutch, from about the interbellum onward, everybody became bilingual, the generation born after World War II being raised exclusively in French. In the countryside, the passing on of Flemish stopped during the 1930s or 1940s. Consequently, the vast majority of those still having an active command of Flemish are older than 60. Therefore, complete extinction of French Flemish can be expected in the coming decades., by Hugo Ryckeboer. University of Ghent. ;Basque Country Testimonies of Basque language usage in the French Basque Country Historic recession of Basque language The French Basque Country has been subject to intense French-language pressure exerted over the Basque- speaking communities. Basque was both persecuted and excluded from administration and official public use during the takeover of the National Convention (1792-1795), War of the Pyrenees and the Napoleonic period. The compulsory national education system imposed early on a French-only approach (mid-19th century), marginalizing Basque, and by the 1960s family transmission was grinding to a halt in many areas at the feet of the Pyrenees. By the 2010s, the receding trend has been somewhat mitigated by the establishment of Basque schooling (the ikastolak) spearheaded by the network Seaska, as well as the influence of the Basque territories from Spain. ;Brittany The shifting of the linguistic boundary in Brittany, from Breton to French, 900-1950 According to Fa√±ch Broudic, Breton has lost 80% of its speakers in 60 years. Other sources mention that 70% of Breton speakers are over 60. Furthermore, 60% of children received Breton from their parents in the 20s and only 6% in the 80s. Since the 1980s, monolingual speakers are no longer attested. On the 27 October 2015, the Senate rejected the draft law on ratification of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages driving away the assumption of Congress for the adoption of the constitutional reform which would have given the value and legitimacy to regional languages such as Breton. ;Corsica Corsican was long employed as a conglomerate of local vernaculars in combination with Italian, the official language in Corsica until 1859; afterwards Italian was replaced by French, owing to the acquisition of the island by France from Genoa in 1768. Over the next two centuries, the use of French grew to the extent that, by the Liberation in 1945, all islanders had a working knowledge of French. The 20th century saw a wholesale language shift, with islanders changing their language practices to the extent that there were no monolingual Corsican speakers left by the 1960s. By 1995, an estimated 65 percent of islanders had some degree of proficiency in Corsican, and a small minority, perhaps 10 percent, used Corsican as a first language.

Historically, most of the region was part of the Danish and North Frisian Language area, adjacent in the South to the German-speaking Holstein. But with the reformation in the 16th century German became church language and in the 19th century also school language in the southern parts of Schleswig. Added to this came the influence of German- speaking Holsatian nobility and traders. German was (occasionally) also spoken at the royal court in Copenhagen. This political and economic development led gradually to a German language dominating in the southern parts of Schleswig. Native dialects such as the Angel Danish or Eiderstedt Frisian vanished. In the Flensburg area, there arose the mixed language Petuh combining Danish and German elements. As late as in 1851 (in the period of nationalization) the Danish government tried to stop the language shift, but without success in the long run. After the Second Schleswig War the Prussians introduced a number of language policy measures in the other way to expand the use of (High) German as the language of administration, schooling and church service. Today, Danish and North Frisian are recognized as minority languages in the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein. =Hungary= Cumans, seeking refuge from the Mongols, settled in Hungary and were later Magyarized. The Jassic people of Hungary originally spoke the Jassic dialect of Ossetic, but they fully adopted Magyar, forgetting their former language. The territory of today's Hungary was formerly settled by Slavonic tribes, which gradually assimilated to Magyar. Also, language shift may have happened in Hungarian pre-history, as the prehistoric culture of Magyars shows very little similarity to that of speakers of other Uralic languages. =Ireland= =Israel= An example is the shift from Hebrew to Aramaic in the land of Israel during the time of Classical Antiquity. Another example is during the Middle Ages, in the land of Israel, shifting from Aramaic to Arabic through the advent of Islam. =Italy= Frequency of use of regional languages in Italy, based on ISTAT data from 2015. The Italian peninsula, the Po river basin and the nearby islands are home to various languages, most of which are Latin-derived. Italy would be politically organized into states until the late 19th century. Since the times of the Renaissance, a trans-Italian language was developed in central Italy, based on Florentine Tuscan; in light of its cultural prestige, it was used for formal, literary and written purposes among the literate classes from the various states of mainland Italy, Sicily and Corsica (France), sidelining the other dialects in education and formal settings. Thus, literary Florentine was established as the most representative dialect of Italy long before its political unification in 1861, Tuscan having been officially adopted by the preunitarian states. Italian further expanded as a common language for everyday use throughout the country after World War II. Most other languages, with the exception of those spoken by specific ethno- linguistic groups, long served as local vernaculars alongside Italian; therefore they have been mislabelled \\"dialects\\" by their own speakers, but they are still usually spoken just as much as standard Italian in a diglossic spectrum with little conflict. For instance, the local Venetian dialects in Northeast Italy are widely used and locally promoted in the region; after all, Italian had been an integral part of the Republic of Venice since the 14th century, whose elites used to revere the most prominent Tuscan authors and tuscanize their own speech as well. On a survey made by Il Gazzettino in 2015, 70% of respondents told they spoke Venetian \\"very or quite often\\" in the family, while 68% with friends. A much lower percentage reported to use it at work (35%); the local dialect is less used in formal situations. However, the frequency of use within the family networks and friendship stopped respectively at -4 and -11 percentage points, suggesting a slow morphing to Italian, while the use in the workplace dropped to -22 percentage points. A visible generational gap has also been noted, since the students and young people under the age of 25 are the social group where the use of dialect fell below the threshold of absolute majority (respectively 43 and 41%). Nonetheless, despite some tendencies signalling the slow advancement of standard Italian, the local dialects of Veneto and the Province of Trieste are still widely spoken alongside Italian; like in much of Italy, the presence of Italian in Northeast Italy does not seem to take anything away from the region's linguistic heritage. Like the aforementioned case of Northeast Italy, even in Southern Italy and Sicily the local dialects from the Italo-Dalmatian family are widely used in combination with standard Italian, depending upon the social context. More specifically, Italian as the prevalent language spoken among family members is spoken the least in Campania (20,7%), Calabria (25,3%) and Sicily (26,6%), contrary to frequency of use of the local dialects (Basilicata, 69,4%; Calabria 68,6%; Campania, 75,2%; Sicily, 68,8%). ;Germanic languages Trentino's Cimbrian, a Germanic language related to Bavarian, was spoken by at least 20,000 people in the 19th century, with 3,762 people in 1921 and fewer than 300 in 2007. The same scenario goes for M√≤cheno and Walser. ;Sardinia Unlike the neighbouring island of CorsicaToso, Fiorenzo. Lo spazio linguistico corso tra insularit√† e destino di frontiera, Universit√† di Udine (France) and elsewhere in today's Italy, where Italian was the standard language shared by the various local elites since the late Middle Ages, Italian was first officially introduced to Sardinia, to the detriment of both Spanish and Sardinian (the only surviving Neo-Latin language from the Southern branch), only in 1760 and 1764 by the then-ruling House of Savoy, from Piedmont.Bolognesi, Roberto (1998). The Phonology of Campidanian Sardinian: A Unitary Account of a Self-Organizing Structure. Holland Academic Graphics S'italianu in Sard√¨nnia , Amos Cardia, IskraBolognesi, Roberto; Heeringa, Wilbert. Sardegna fra tante lingue, pp.25, 2005, Condaghes Because of the promotion and enforcement of the Italian language and culture upon the Sardinian population since then, the majority of the locals switched over to such politically dominant language and no longer speak their native ones, which have seen steady decline in use. The language has been in fact severely compromised to the point that only 13‚ÑÖ of the children are able to speak it,La Nuova Sardegna, 04/11/10, Per salvare i segni dell'identit√† ‚Äì di Paolo Coretti and today is mostly kept as a heritage language. With the exception of a few sparsely populated areas where Sardinian can still be heard for everyday purposes, the island's indigenous languages have by now been therefore largely absorbed into Italian; the language contact ultimately resulted in the emergence of a specific variety of Italian, slightly divergent from the standard one. =Malta= Before the 1930s, Italian was the only official language of Malta, although it was spoken by only the upper classes, with Maltese being spoken by the lower class. Even though English has replaced Italian as a co-official language alongside Maltese, the Italian-speaking population has since grown, and the growth of English in the country now threatens the status of Maltese. A trend among the younger generations is to mix English and Italian vocabulary patterns, in making new Maltese words. For example, the Maltese word \\"bibljoteka\\" has been overtaken by \\"librerija\\", formed from \\"library\\" and an Italian ending. In addition to mixing English with Italian, Maltenglish involves the use of English words in Maltese sentences. Trends show that English is becoming the language of choice for more and more people, and is transforming the Maltese language. =Paraguay= Guarani, specifically the primary variety known as Paraguayan Guarani (endonym ava√±e'·∫Ω 'the people's language'), an indigenous language of South America belonging to the Tupi‚ÄìGuarani familyBritton, A. Scott (2004). Guaran√≠- English/English-Guaran√≠ Concise Dictionary. New York: Hippocrene Books. of the Tupian languages, is one of the official languages of Paraguay (along with Spanish), where it is spoken by the majority of the population, and where half of the rural population is monolingual.Mortimer, K 2006 \\"Guaran√≠ Acad√©mico or Jopar√°? Educator Perspectives and Ideological Debate in Paraguayan Bilingual Education\\" Working Papers in Educational Linguistics 21/2: 45-71, 2006 Guarani is one of the most-widely spoken indigenous languages of the Americas and the only one whose speakers include a large proportion of non-indigenous people. This represents a unique anomaly in the Americas, where language shift towards European colonial languages has otherwise been a nearly universal cultural and identity marker of mestizos (people of mixed Spanish and Amerindian ancestry), and also of culturally assimilated, upwardly mobile Amerindian people. Paraguayan Guarani has been used throughout Paraguayan history as a symbol of nationalistic pride. Populist dictators such as Jos√© Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia and Alfredo Stroessner used the language to appeal to common Paraguayans, and upon the advent of Paraguayan democracy in 1992, Guarani was enshrined in the new constitution as a co-equal language along with Spanish. Jopara, the mixture of Spanish and Guarani, is spoken by an estimated 90% of the population of Paraguay. Code-switching between the two languages takes place on a spectrum where more Spanish is used for official and business- related matters, whereas more Guarani is used in art and in everyday life. =Philippines= In the Philippines, Spanish-speaking families have gradually switched over to English since the end of World War II until Spanish ceased to be a practical everyday language in the country. Another example would be the gradual death of the Kinaray-a language of Panay as many native speakers especially in the province of Iloilo are switching to Hiligaynon or mixing the two languages together. Kinaray-a was once spoken in the towns outside the vicinity of Ilo√≠lo City, while Hiligaynon was limited to only the eastern coasts and the city proper. However, due to media and other factors such as urbanization, many younger speakers have switched from Kinaray-a to Hiligaynon, especially in the towns of Cabatuan, Santa Barbara, Calinog, Miagao, Passi City, Guimbal, Tigbauan, Tubungan, etc. Many towns, especially Janiuay, Lambunao, and San Joaquin still have a sizeable Kinaray-a-speaking population, with the standard accent being similar to that spoken in the predominantly Karay-a province of Antique. Even in the province of Antique, \\"Hiligaynization\\" is an issue to be confronted as the province, especially the capital town of San Jos√© de Buenavista, undergoes urbanisation. Many investors from Ilo√≠lo City bring with them Hiligaynon-speaking workers who are reluctant to learn the local language. One of the problems of Kinaray-a is its written form, as its unique \\"schwa sound\\" is difficult to represent in orthography. As time goes by, Kinaray-a has disappeared in many areas it was once spoken especially in the island of Mindoro and only remnants of the past remain in such towns as Pinamalayan, Bansud, Gloria, Bongabong, Roxas, Mansalay, and Bulalacao in Oriental Mindoro and Sablayan, Calintaan, San Jose, and Magsaysay in Occidental Mindoro, as Tagalog has become the standard and dominantly recognised official language of these areas. Palawan has 52 local languages and dialects. Due to this diversity, internal migration and mass media, Tagalog has effectively taken over as the lingua franca on the island. In Luzon, the regions of Camarines Norte and Pampanga have seen a shift to Tagalog. =Singapore= After Singapore's independence in 1965, there was a general language shift in the country's interracial lingua franca from Malay to English, which was chosen as the first language for the country. Among the Chinese community in Singapore, there was a language shift from the various dialects of Chinese to English and Mandarin Chinese. Until the 1980s, Singaporean Hokkien was the lingua franca of Chinese community in Singapore, which has since been replaced with English and Mandarin today. There has been a general language attrition in the use of Chinese other than Mandarin Chinese, especially amongst the younger segments of the Singaporean population. =Spain= Asturian-Leonese language The progressive dominion exerted by the Kingdom of Castile over Spain in as much as it gained political power throughout centuries, contributed to the expansion of its language at the expenses of the rest. The accession of the Castilian House of Trastamara to the Crown of Aragon by mid-15th century saw the gradual displacement of the royal languages of the Crown of Aragon, Aragonese and Catalan, despite the prolific Valencian literature in Catalan in this period. Nebrija's Gramatica castellana (1492), sponsored by the new Spanish monarch Ferdinand II of Aragon, was meant to help expand Castilian, \\"the companion of the Empire\\". As the Crown of Castile expanded, its different governmental officials at different levels required their subjects to use or understand Castilian and sideline other vulgar languages, or vernaculars. It often meant the use of interpreters in lawsuits, which could tilt the outcome of the case, e.g. the Basque witch trials, and the increased use of Castilian in assemblies and decision-making bodies, and documents, despite not being the commonly understood language in a number of areas, like most of the Basque districts (Navarre, √Ålava, etc.), Catalonia, Galicia, Asturias, parts of Aragon, etc. As Aragonese retreated to the sub-Pyrenean valleys, Arabic vanished by the early 17th century, when forced cultural assimilation of the Moriscos was coupled with expulsion (completed in 1614). The arrival of the Bourbons (1700) intensified the centralization of governmental structures and the imposition of Castilian as the only language for official purposes, replacing in 1716 Catalan as the language of Justice Administration in the relevant territories (Nueva Planta Decrees). Unlike Catalan, Basque was never a language written on official documents, but was equally affected. It lost ground to Castilian in all its buffer geographic areas, as well as main institutions as a communication language, after a number of decrees and orders established Castilian as \\"the national language of the Empire\\" during Charles III's reign; printing in languages other than Spanish was forbidden (1766), and Castilian was the only language taught in school (1768). The Peninsular War was followed by the centralization of Spain (Constitutions of 1812, 1837, 1845, 1856, etc.), with only the Basque districts keeping a separate status until 1876. Compulsory education in 1856 made the use of Castilian (Spanish) mandatory, as well as discouraging and forbidding the use of other languages in some social and institutional settings. Franco and his nationalist dictatorship imposed Spanish as the only valid language for any formal social interaction (1937). By the early 21st century, Spanish was the overwhelmingly dominant language in Spain, with Basque, Catalan, and Galician surviving and developing in their respective regions with different levels of recognition since 1980. Other minorized languages (Asturian, Aragonese) have also seen some recognition in the early 21st century. Catalan, sharing with Basque a strong link between language and identity, enjoys a fairly sound status. Basque competence has risen during the last decades, but daily use has not risen accordingly. The Endangered Languages Project has classified Asturian as being at risk and Aragonese as endangered. =Taiwan= The most commonly used home language in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, 2010. Taiwanese Mandarin are marked with blue. Taiwanese aborigines used only Austronesian languages before other ethnic groups conquered Taiwan. After widespread migration of Han peoples from the 17th to the 19th century, many Taiwanese Plains Aborigines became Sinicized, and shifted their language use to other Sinitic tongues, (mainly Taiwanese Hokkien). Additionally, some Hakka people (a Han Chinese ethnic subgroup) also shifted from Hakka Chinese to Hokkien (also called Hoklo). This happened especially in Yongjing, Changhua, Xiluo, Yunlin, etc. They are called Hoklo-Hakka (PhaÃçk-fa-s·π≥: HoÃçk-l√≥-hak, PeÃçh-oƒì-jƒ´: H√¥-l√≥-kheh, Hanzi: Á¶è‰Ω¨ÂÆ¢). When Taiwan was under Japanese rule, Japanese became the official language, with the Japanese government promoting Japanese language education. It also led to the creation of Yilan Creole Japanese, a mixture of Japanese, Atayal language, and Hokkien in Yilan County. In World War II, under the Japanification Movement, Chinese was banned in newspapers and school lectures, and the usage of Japanese at home was encouraged, so many urban people turned to using Japanese. In 1941, 57% of Taiwanese could speak Japanese. After the ROC government established rule over Taiwan in 1945, it forbade the use of Japanese in newspapers and schools, and promoted the Guoyu movement () to popularize Standard Mandarin, often through coercive means. In the primary education system, people using local languages would be fined or forced to wear a dialect card. In the mass media, local languages were also discouraged or banned, and some books on the romanization of local languages (e.g. Bibles, lyrics books, PeÃçh-≈çe-jƒ´) were banned. In 1975, The Radio and Television Act () was adopted, restricting the usage of local languages on the radio or TV.wikisource:zh:Âª£Êí≠ÈõªË¶ñÊ≥ï (Ê∞ëÂúã64Âπ¥Á´ãÊ≥ï65Âπ¥ÂÖ¨Â∏É), 1975 In 1985, after the draft of the Language and Script Law () was released by the Ministry of Education, it received considerable opposition because it banned the use of Taiwanese unofficial languages in the public domain. In response, some Hakka groups demonstrated to save their language. After 1987 when martial law was lifted, the Guoyu movement ceased. The shift towards monolingual Mandarin was more pronounced among Hakka-speaking communities, attributed to Hakka's low social prestige. Before the KMT took over the island from Japan, the Hakka were expected to learn both Hokkien and Japanese. However, the lack of a significant Japanese-speaking base for gaining and then retaining Japanese fluency meant that most Hakka learned only Hokkien. When the KMT fled to Taiwan from mainland China, most mainlanders settled mainly in northern Taiwan, close to Hakka-speaking areas, thus spurring a linguistic shift from Hokkien to Mandarin within the Taipei area. As the bulk of economic activity centered around patronage networks revolving around Mandarin-speaking KMT membership, most of the Hakka became Mandarin monolinguals, due to a shift in social mobility formerly centered around Hokkien. Elsewhere, although the Hokkien speech-community shrank within the population, most Hokkien-speaking households have retained fluency in Hokkien, helped by the liberalization of Taiwanese politics and the end of martial law. Nevertheless, Taiwanese Mandarin has become the most common language in Taiwan today, and the most common home language of Taiwanese youth. In the population census of 2010, Mandarin is the most common home language in the Taipei metropolitan area, Taoyuan, Matsu, aboriginal areas, some Hakka-majority areas, as well as some urban areas of Taichung and Kaohsiung. Conversely, the ability of Taiwanese to speak ethnic languages is strikingly on the decline. =Turkey= Studies have suggested an elite cultural dominance-driven linguistic replacement model to explain the adoption of Turkish by Anatolian indigenous inhabitants. = United Kingdom = ;Cornwall The shifting of the linguistic boundary in Cornwall, from Cornish to English, 1300-1750 ;Scottish Gaelic Gaelic has long suffered from its lack of use in educational and administrative contexts, and was long suppressed.See Kenneth MacKinnon (1991) Gaelic: A Past and Future Prospect. Edinburgh: The Saltire Society. The shift from Gaelic to Scots and Scottish English has been ongoing since about 1200 CE; Gaelic has gone from being the dominant language in almost all areas of modern-day Scotland to an endangered language spoken by only about 1% of the population.Ellis, Peter Berresford. 1985. The Celtic Revolution: A Study in Anti-imperialism. Talybont: Y Lolfa. With the advent of devolution, however, Scottish Gaelic has begun to receive greater attention, and it has achieved a degree of official recognition when the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act was enacted by the Scottish Parliament on 21 April 2005. Gaelic medium education in Scotland now enrolls more than 2000 students a year. Nevertheless, the number of native speakers continues to decline, and it is a minority language in most of the traditional G√†idhealtachd, including all census areas outside of the Outer Hebrides. ;London Cockney English, traditionally spoken by working-class Londoners has been predicted to be replaced by Multicultural London English (MLE) or 'Jafaican' within 30 years as Cockneys move out of London. The new language is theorised to have emerged as new migrants spoke their own forms of English such as Nigerian and Indian and contains elements from \\"learners‚Äô varieties\\" as migrants learn English as a second language. =United States= Although English has been the majority language in the United States since independence in 1776, hundreds of aboriginal languages were spoken before western European settlement. French was once the main language in Louisiana, Missouri, and areas along the border with Quebec, but the speaking has dwindled after new waves of migration and the rise of English as a lingua franca. Californio Spanish became a minority language during the California Gold Rush; it has largely been overtaken by English and Mexican Spanish, surviving mainly as a prestige dialect in Northern and Central California. German was once the main language in large areas of the Great Plains and Pennsylvania, but it was suppressed by anti-German sentiment during the First World War. =Vietnam= Since the fall of Saigon at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, French has declined heavily in Vietnam from being a government language and primary language of education in South Vietnam to being a minority language limited to the elite classes and elderly population. Today, French is spoken fluently by only slightly over 5% of the Vietnamese population. The language shift from French to Vietnamese occurred earlier in the north due to Viet Minh and later communist policies enforcing Vietnamese as the language of politics and education. However, since the late 1990s, there has been a minor revival of French in Vietnam. Reversing American linguist Joshua Fishman has proposed a method of reversing language shift which involves assessing the degree to which a particular language is disrupted in order to determine the most effective method of revitalising.

A Wiradjuri man, he is the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's International Affairs Analyst, occasional presenter on ABC TV, and Professor of Global Affairs at Griffith University in Queensland. Early years Grant was born on 30 September 1963 in Griffith, New South Wales, the son of Stan Grant Sr, an elder of the Wiradjuri people. The Wiradjuri are an Aboriginal Australian people from the south-west inland region of New South Wales. The Wiradjuri also have roots in inner Victoria, which is where he spent much of his childhood. Grant graduated from the Australian National University. Career = Journalism = Grant has more than 30 years of experience working in broadcast radio and television news and current affairs. He spent several years as a news presenter on the Australian Macquarie Radio Network, Seven, SBS, along with a long-term stint at CNN International as a Senior International Correspondent in Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong and Beijing, before starting with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). 1990s ‚Äì 2012 In 1994, as host of the Seven Network current affairs programme Real Life he won the Logie Award for Most Popular Current Affairs Programme. In 2007 he took on the role of co-presenter of the one-hour SBS World News Australia bulletin, and also presented ABC Local Radio's Indigenous programme Speaking Out. In December 2007, Grant resigned from SBS World News Australia and was replaced by Anton Enus. In 2009 Grant was appointed UAE correspondent for CNN. Based in CNN's new Abu Dhabi news-gathering and production centre, Grant covered stories from both the UAE and the surrounding region and hosted the programme Prism. 2012: NITV and pay TV Grant returned to Australia in 2012 to help launch SBS' new National Indigenous Television (NITV) channel, and in 2013 hosted a nightly late night news programme NewsNight for Sky News Australia, which aired weeknights at 11pm. From 2014 he started hosting Sky News Australia's Reporting Live with Stan Grant at 6pm, a nightly news programme reporting on the serious news stories of the day, and in April of that year he hosted Crimes that Shook Australia, a six-part television drama series broadcast on Foxtel. 2015: Viral speech In 2015 Grant took part in a public debate at the IQ2 stage of The Ethics Centre, with immigration lawyer Pallavi Sinha, Herald Sun columnist Rita Panahi and actor Jack Thompson to argue for or against the topic ‚ÄúRacism is destroying the Australian dream‚Äù. He told of the impact of colonisation on Indigenous Australians, past and present. He argued that \\"the Australian Dream\\" was based upon racism, mentioning his ancestors and others who were forced into institutions and unpaid work. The video and transcript of his address is available on The Ethics Centre's website and YouTube. The debate itself was a finalist in the United Nations Association of Australia Media Peace Awards for \\"its role in stimulating public awareness and understanding\\". Media commentator and author Mike Carlton described Grant's speech as Australia's ‚ÄúMartin Luther King moment‚Äù. The video of his address, posted on Facebook, went viral, and his name trended on Twitter the next day. 2017‚Äìpresent In 2017, Grant joined the ABC as editor of Indigenous Affairs and fill-in host of nightly current affairs programme 7.30. Grant also hosted The Link, which aired on Friday nights. In 2018 Grant started hosting a flagship national night current affairs programme, Matter of Fact, on the ABC News TV Channel and ABC News Radio. He was also appointed chief Asia correspondent for the ABC News Network. The program was cancelled after 10 months, ending on 29 November 2018, after which time he took up the new role of Indigenous and International Affairs Analyst with the ABC, and became Professor of Global Affairs at Griffith University. This ended his presenting and journalistic work on ABC TV, however he occasionally contributed to The Drum (TV program) and Four Corners. In 2019 Grant moved to Doha, capital city of Qatar, to start work with Al Jazeera English. In February 2020 he wrote an article commenting on High Court's ruling in the Love v Commonwealth, which determined that two men could not be deported as aliens, although not Australian citizens, because of their Aboriginal identity. In it, he writes \\"The judges' opinions make fascinating and inspiring reading. They are profound, wise, and sensitive\\", that they wrote their judgments \\"with nuance\\", and had \\"widened the horizon on what it is to be Indigenous and belong to this land\\". In April 2020 he was appointed Vice-Chancellor's Chair of Australian-Indigenous Belonging at Charles Sturt University. In September 2020, it was announced that Grant would become the ABC's International Affairs Analyst with the broadcaster noting his past journalistic experience in China affairs. This was a point of emphasis as its bureaux staff had recently been expelled by Chinese authorities allegedly for unfair and unfavourable reporting coverage. =Books= Grant has authored four works of non-fiction (see below), which have been well received. =Film= Grant wrote, and features in, the full-length documentary film The Australian Dream, released in 2019, the title of which echoes that of his address at the IQ2 debate, which went viral in 2015 (see above). The film looks at the part played by racism in the demonising of Australian Rules football-player Adam Goodes, and won the AACTA Award for best feature documentary in the 2019 series. =Politics= During early 2016 Grant was talked about as running in the 2016 Australian election. Grant ruled out running for the National Party of Australia and said he was not \\"ideologically bound to the left\\" and that he admired people with the \\"small 'l' Liberal approach\\". In mid-March, 9 weeks before the 2019 Australian election, Grant was asked by the Prime Minister Scott Morrison to a meeting at Kirribilli House. While there he was asked to run for the Liberal Party of Australia, but turned down the offer, saying \\"It was an honour to be asked by the Prime Minister, but in the end that role is just not for me. I like what I am doing now, totally independently, and I don‚Äôt have to make my views fit within a party framework.\\" =Current roles= , Grant is the ABC's International Affairs Analyst, Professor of Global Affairs at Griffith University (since October 2018), He is also an ambassador of the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation (AIEF) since 2017. Works =Print= *The Tears of Strangers In 2002, Grant published a memoir, The Tears of Strangers, which details the political and social changes of Indigenous Australians over the period of 40 years, focusing particularly on generations of the Wiradjuri people. *Talking To My Country Grant's second book, Talking To My Country, was published in February 2016. The origins of the book came from the abuse of Adam Goodes in 2015. In a review for The Saturday Paper, Talking To My Country was described as \\"Australia viewed from the riverbank on the edge of town; great affection mixed with discomfort about, 'Advance Australia Fair'\\" (the national anthem). *Australia Day In 2019 Grant published his third book, Australia Day, a follow-up to Talking To My Country about what it means to be Australian. It received favourable reviews. *On Identity On Identity was published in both English and Wiradjuri in 2019, in hardcopy and as an e-book. In it he \\"asks why when it comes to identity he is asked to choose between black and white\\", and \\"argues that it is time to leave identity behind and to embrace cosmopolitanism\\" (catalogue blurb). The book was well received. *Tell it to the World Tell it to the World: An Indigenous Memoir was published in the US in 2019. =Film= *The Australian Dream (2019) Awards , Grant has won the following awards: *Peabody Award (US) *DuPont Award (US) *Asian TV Awards (four times) *Walkley Award (three times) *The Australian Dream won the AACTA Award for best feature documentary film in the 2019 series. Personal life Grant was married to Karla Grant with whom he had three children. A well publicised marriage break-up in 2000, prior to the Sydney Olympic Games, resulted from his starting a relationship with fellow TV personality Tracey Holmes. After criticism from News Corporation tabloids, while News Corporation was involved in the C7 Sport dispute with Seven, his employment at the Seven Network was terminated as a result, and he and Holmes moved to Hong Kong.

In an inertial frame of reference, it is a fictitious volume fixed in space or moving with constant flow velocity through which the continuum (gas, liquid or solid) flows. The surface enclosing the control volume is referred to as the control surface.G.J. Van Wylen and R.E. Sonntag (1985), Fundamentals of Classical Thermodynamics, Section 2.1 (3rd edition), John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York At steady state, a control volume can be thought of as an arbitrary volume in which the mass of the continuum remains constant. As a continuum moves through the control volume, the mass entering the control volume is equal to the mass leaving the control volume. At steady state, and in the absence of work and heat transfer, the energy within the control volume remains constant. It is analogous to the classical mechanics concept of the free body diagram. Overview Typically, to understand how a given physical law applies to the system under consideration, one first begins by considering how it applies to a small, control volume, or \\"representative volume\\". There is nothing special about a particular control volume, it simply represents a small part of the system to which physical laws can be easily applied. This gives rise to what is termed a volumetric, or volume-wise formulation of the mathematical model. One can then argue that since the physical laws behave in a certain way on a particular control volume, they behave the same way on all such volumes, since that particular control volume was not special in any way. In this way, the corresponding point-wise formulation of the mathematical model can be developed so it can describe the physical behaviour of an entire (and maybe more complex) system. In continuum mechanics the conservation equations (for instance, the Navier-Stokes equations) are in integral form. They therefore apply on volumes. Finding forms of the equation that are independent of the control volumes allows simplification of the integral signs. The control volumes can be stationary or they can move with an arbitrary velocity.  Substantive derivative  Computations in continuum mechanics often require that the regular time derivation operator d/dt\\\\; is replaced by the substantive derivative operator D/Dt. This can be seen as follows. Consider a bug that is moving through a volume where there is some scalar, e.g. pressure, that varies with time and position: p=p(t,x,y,z)\\\\;. If the bug during the time interval from t\\\\; to t+dt\\\\; moves from (x,y,z)\\\\; to (x+dx, y+dy, z+dz),\\\\; then the bug experiences a change dp\\\\; in the scalar value, :dp = \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial t}dt \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x}dx \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial y}dy \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial z}dz (the total differential). If the bug is moving with a velocity \\\\mathbf v = (v_x, v_y, v_z), the change in particle position is \\\\mathbf v dt = (v_xdt, v_ydt, v_zdt), and we may write :\\\\begin{alignat}{2} dp & = \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial t}dt \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x}v_xdt \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial y}v_ydt \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial z}v_zdt \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial t} \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x}v_x \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial y}v_y \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial z}v_z \\\\right)dt \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial t} \\\\+ \\\\mathbf v \\\\cdot abla p \\\\right)dt. \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{alignat} where abla p is the gradient of the scalar field p. So: :\\\\frac{d}{dt} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf v \\\\cdot abla. If the bug is just moving with the flow, the same formula applies, but now the velocity vector,v, is that of the flow, u. The last parenthesized expression is the substantive derivative of the scalar pressure. Since the pressure p in this computation is an arbitrary scalar field, we may abstract it and write the substantive derivative operator as :\\\\frac{D}{Dt} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot abla.

Emery had a significant amateur women's boxing career, winning various state and national championships, sparking interest when she announced she was to become a professional. She debuted as a professional boxer on August 19 of '97, with a second- round knockout win over Colleen Smith at her hometown of Austin. Her second bout was on January 6 of '98, when she met Cinthya Prouder. Emery suffered her first career defeat when outpointed by Prouder over four rounds. On February 11, she met the very experienced Gloria Ramirez at Fort Worth, Texas, losing by a four-round split decision. In March of that year, Emery traveled halfway across the Pacific, to meet Colleen Smith in a rematch, at Honolulu, Hawaii. She defeated Smith for a second time, this time by knockout in round three. Next for Emery was Angelica Villain, on May 1, back in Emery's home state. With a knockout 24 seconds into the first round, Emery scored one of the quickest wins in male or female boxing history. Only seven days later, she made her Las Vegas debut, when she knocked out the highly touted Valerie Troike in three rounds. That was Troike's first career defeat, after six fights without a loss. After the win against Troike, however, Emery's career started to go down, as she lost two of her final three bouts as a professional. On July 31, she met future world champion \\"Downtown Leona Brown\\" in Atlantic City, New Jersey, losing by a six-round split decision. On August 15, she beat the well-known Jayla Ortiz by a six-round unanimous decision, in what would turn out to be her career's final win. That fight was also held in Las Vegas. Emery went to Worley, Idaho, a city where women's boxing is a main attraction, to meet Theresa Arnold on November 23, and she lost a close, eight-round split decision (scores of 75-78, 75-77 and 77-76). Curiously, this would be the last fight both for Emery and for Arnold, as the two rivals announced their retirement soon after the fight. Sonya Emery compiled a lifetime record of five wins and four losses, with four wins by knockout. She was never KOed herself.

Work In 1964, Rudder went to Arnhem Land as a teacher, and later as a community development worker and educator among adult Indigenous Australians. In that time he learned to speak the language of the region, and analysed its grammar and syntax. He sought to gain formal educational qualifications after moving to Canberra, and has since gained a master's degree in Anthropology focussing on Aboriginal Classificatory Theory and Cognitive Structures and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Aboriginal Anthropology focusing on Yolngu Cosmology (focusing on beliefs regarding the nature of existence and how the world is ordered.) =Language teaching= Stan Grant From 1993 to 2010, Rudder was heavily involved with Stan Grant, an elder of the Wiradjuri people, in reclaiming the Wiradjuri language that was at that time effectively dead. He took anthropological studies and records amounting to the records of fewer than 2,000 words and applied the language and cognitive analysis he had previously applied to the Yolngu language, to begin to reconstruct the Wiradjuri language. With Grant, who provided a sense of the language remembered from his youth in World War II among Wiradjuri-speaking family and tribal members, notably his grandfather, they have established training sessions to teach the language across Wiradjuri country.

It has a population of about 3,000. Parts of Hengqin were leased to Macau by the State Council of the People's Republic of China starting in 2009, with the area expanding. In the leased parts of the island, Macau law applies. The whole island is designated a special economic district, as Hengqin New Area, similar to Binhai New Area in Tianjin and Pudong New Area in Shanghai.  Geography  Hengqin Island is adjacent to the Taipa and Coloane districts of Macau, with the Shisanmen Waterway separating them, and is connected to Macau's Cotai via the Lotus Bridge. The island is the largest among the 146 islands of Zhuhai, being roughly three times the size of Macau. It has broad bays, sandy beaches, strangely shaped jagged rocks, scenery, and natural vegetation cover. Hengqin was formerly made up of two islands, Xiaohengqin (; ) and Dahengqin (; ), which were recently connected as a result of land reclamation. The reclaimed island is large.  History  Portugal claimed both Xiao Hengqin and Da Hengqin, along with the larger former island of Wanzai (Portuguese: Lapa) ‚Äî now a peninsula ‚Äî to their north, as part of the Prov√≠ncia da Macau, because \\"Portuguese schools are established there\\". In 1896, Portuguese determined to occupy the two islands of Hengqin, but did not succeed in doing so. Portugal briefly occupied them before World War II. Since the land reclamation and development, there has been a growing opinion in Macau that the island should be leased to Macau, which has very limited land and little room for further development. By 1 September 2005, plans were revealed that the government of Guangdong will allow tax exemptions and adopt flexible immigration control in Hengqin to promote investment from Hong Kong and Macau. On 27 June 2009 the government of Macau officially announced that the University of Macau would build its new campus on 1 km2 of the island, in a stretch directly facing the Cotai area, south of the current border post. This would be the first of other possible projects. Construction of the campus would take three years and would include an underwater tunnel. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress officially adopted a decision authorising Macau to exercise jurisdiction over the new campus on its opening.Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Assembly of the People's Republic of China on the delegation of powers to the Macau Special Administrative Region to exercise jurisdiction on the new campus of the University of Macau to be installed on Hengqin, also published via Chief Executive Notice No. 19/2009 in the Official Bulletin No. 35/2009. See Macau law would apply in the university campus and it would not be necessary to pass a formal border post. The Macau Special Administrative Region will pay an amount of rent - which has not yet been set - for the use of the land. In early 2013 the Macau Legislative Assembly passed Law 3/2013 providing for the application of Macau Law in the campus effective on opening day.see published in the Official Bulletin No. 8/2013. In 2020 the Macau Legislative Assembly passed Law 1/2020 providing for the application of Macau Law in a part of Hengqin Port.see published in the Official Bulletin No. 11/2020 Macau's juridisction over this area became effective on 18 March.  Tourism  With Hengqin island, the goal of the authorities is to create a combined Las Vegas and Orlando for Asia, with an expansive casino offering in Macau, and at the same time non-gaming leisure and tourist activities. In late 2005, Las Vegas Sands openly discussed its multibillion-dollar plan to develop parts of Hengqin Island into a convention and resort destination. The project was to include four million sq ft of convention space, hotels, retail, vacation homes, and golf, tennis and yachting amenities. Las Vegas Sands press release, 1/11/2007 On 29 November 2010, the main body of the Chime-Long International Ocean Resort (with an initial investment of 10 billion yuan) kicked off the construction on Hengqin Island and was originally expected to become operational in 2013. The Chimelong Ocean Kingdom, consisting of entertainment facilities, amusement rides, performances, high-tech experiences and animal watching as well as the dolphin-themed hotel with 1,888 guest rooms was opened in 2014, and has been the 11th most visited theme park in the world in 2017. The Hengqin International Tennis Center opened in September 2015. It currently hosts three international competitions: the WTA Elite Trophy, the Zhuhai Open and the Asia-Pacific Wildcard Playoff for the Australian Open.

Biography  DiCaprio was born to George Leon DiCaprio (May 14, 1902 - November 18, 1965) and Olga Anne Jacobs (December 23, 1904 - May 16, 1984). His father was the son of Italian immigrants, Salvatore Di Caprio (1866-1966) and Rosina Cassella (1875-1941), and his mother was of German descent. DiCaprio was active in underground comix throughout the 1970s, as a writer, editor, publisher, and distributor.Agard, Chancellor. \\"Five Things You Need to Know About Leonardo DiCaprio's Dad George,\\" People magazine website (Feb. 8, 2016). He is known for such titles as Greaser Comics (Half-Ass Press/Last Gasp), Forbidden Knowledge (Last Gasp), and Cocaine Comix (Last Gasp), collaborating with artists such as Laurie Anderson, Pete von Sholly, and Rich Chidlaw. He was also a performance artist. Comics writer Harvey Pekar details a DiCaprio performance in Los Angeles in February 1988 where DiCaprio did \\"a light show using brine shrimp and worms. I'd hit 'em with cold water and they'd move around and I'd project 'em on a wall magnified. It blew people's minds.\\"Pekar, Harvey and Paul Mavrides (illustrator), \\"The L.A.

Personal life  George Paul DiCaprio met Irmelin Indenbirken (born 1945), a German immigrant, in college; the two later married and moved to Los Angeles. The couple had one son, Leonardo DiCaprio, and divorced shortly after, when the boy was a year old. While Leonardo lived mostly with his mother, his parents agreed to live next door to each other so as not to deprive him of his father's presence in his life.

In statistical significance testing, a one-tailed test and a two- tailed test are alternative ways of computing the statistical significance of a parameter inferred from a data set, in terms of a test statistic. A two- tailed test is appropriate if the estimated value is greater or less than a certain range of values, for example, whether a test taker may score above or below a specific range of scores. This method is used for null hypothesis testing and if the estimated value exists in the critical areas, the alternative hypothesis is accepted over the null hypothesis. A one-tailed test is appropriate if the estimated value may depart from the reference value in only one direction, left or right, but not both. An example can be whether a machine produces more than one-percent defective products. In this situation, if the estimated value exists in one of the one-sided critical areas, depending on the direction of interest (greater than or less than), the alternative hypothesis is accepted over the null hypothesis. Alternative names are one-sided and two-sided tests; the terminology \\"tail\\" is used because the extreme portions of distributions, where observations lead to rejection of the null hypothesis, are small and often \\"tail off\\" toward zero as in the normal distribution, colored in yellow, or \\"bell curve\\", pictured on the right and colored in green.  Applications  One-tailed tests are used for asymmetric distributions that have a single tail, such as the chi-squared distribution, which are common in measuring goodness-of-fit, or for one side of a distribution that has two tails, such as the normal distribution, which is common in estimating location; this corresponds to specifying a direction. Two-tailed tests are only applicable when there are two tails, such as in the normal distribution, and correspond to considering either direction significant. In the approach of Ronald Fisher, the null hypothesis H0 will be rejected when the p-value of the test statistic is sufficiently extreme (vis- a-vis the test statistic's sampling distribution) and thus judged unlikely to be the result of chance. This is usually done by comparing the resulting p-value with the specified significance level, denoted by \\\\alpha, when computing the statistical significance of a parameter. In a one-tailed test, \\"extreme\\" is decided beforehand as either meaning \\"sufficiently small\\" or meaning \\"sufficiently large\\" ‚Äì values in the other direction are considered not significant. One may report that the left or right tail probability as the one-tailed p-value, which ultimately corresponds to the direction in which the test statistic deviates from H0. In a two-tailed test, \\"extreme\\" means \\"either sufficiently small or sufficiently large\\", and values in either direction are considered significant.John E. Freund, (1984) Modern Elementary Statistics, sixth edition. Prentice hall. (Section \\"Inferences about Means\\", chapter \\"Significance Tests\\", page 289.) For a given test statistic, there is a single two-tailed test, and two one-tailed tests, one each for either direction. When provided a significance level \\\\alpha, the critical regions would exist on the two tail ends of the distribution with an area of \\\\alpha/2 each for a two- tailed test. Alternatively, the critical region would solely exist on the single tail end with an area of \\\\alpha for a one-tailed test. For a given significance level in a two-tailed test for a test statistic, the corresponding one-tailed tests for the same test statistic will be considered either twice as significant (half the p-value) if the data is in the direction specified by the test, or not significant at all (p-value above \\\\alpha) if the data is in the direction opposite of the critical region specified by the test. For example, if flipping a coin, testing whether it is biased towards heads is a one-tailed test, and getting data of \\"all heads\\" would be seen as highly significant, while getting data of \\"all tails\\" would be not significant at all (p = 1). By contrast, testing whether it is biased in either direction is a two-tailed test, and either \\"all heads\\" or \\"all tails\\" would both be seen as highly significant data. In medical testing, while one is generally interested in whether a treatment results in outcomes that are better than chance, thus suggesting a one-tailed test; a worse outcome is also interesting for the scientific field, therefore one should use a two-tailed test that corresponds instead to testing whether the treatment results in outcomes that are different from chance, either better or worse.J M Bland, D G Bland (BMJ, 1994) Statistics Notes: One and two sided tests of significance In the archetypal lady tasting tea experiment, Fisher tested whether the lady in question was better than chance at distinguishing two types of tea preparation, not whether her ability was different from chance, and thus he used a one-tailed test.  Coin flipping example  In coin flipping, the null hypothesis is a sequence of Bernoulli trials with probability 0.5, yielding a random variable X which is 1 for heads and 0 for tails, and a common test statistic is the sample mean (of the number of heads) \\\\bar X. If testing for whether the coin is biased towards heads, a one-tailed test would be used ‚Äì only large numbers of heads would be significant. In that case a data set of five heads (HHHHH), with sample mean of 1, has a 1/32 = 0.03125 \\\\approx 0.03 chance of occurring, (5 consecutive flips with 2 outcomes - ((1/2)^5 =1/32). This would have p \\\\approx 0.03 and would be significant (rejecting the null hypothesis) if the test was analyzed at a significance level of \\\\alpha = 0.05 (the significance level corresponding to the cutoff bound). However, if testing for whether the coin is biased towards heads or tails, a two-tailed test would be used, and a data set of five heads (sample mean 1) is as extreme as a data set of five tails (sample mean 0). As a result, the p-value would be 2/32 = 0.0625 \\\\approx 0.06 and this would not be significant (not rejecting the null hypothesis) if the test was analyzed at a significance level of \\\\alpha = 0.05.  History  p-value of chi-squared distribution for different number of degrees of freedom The p-value was introduced by Karl Pearson in the Pearson's chi-squared test, where he defined P (original notation) as the probability that the statistic would be at or above a given level. This is a one-tailed definition, and the chi-squared distribution is asymmetric, only assuming positive or zero values, and has only one tail, the upper one. It measures goodness of fit of data with a theoretical distribution, with zero corresponding to exact agreement with the theoretical distribution; the p-value thus measures how likely the fit would be this bad or worse. Normal distribution, showing two tails The distinction between one-tailed and two- tailed tests was popularized by Ronald Fisher in the influential book Statistical Methods for Research Workers, where he applied it especially to the normal distribution, which is a symmetric distribution with two equal tails. The normal distribution is a common measure of location, rather than goodness-of-fit, and has two tails, corresponding to the estimate of location being above or below the theoretical location (e.g., sample mean compared with theoretical mean). In the case of a symmetric distribution such as the normal distribution, the one-tailed p-value is exactly half the two-tailed p-value: Fisher emphasized the importance of measuring the tail ‚Äì the observed value of the test statistic and all more extreme ‚Äì rather than simply the probability of specific outcome itself, in his The Design of Experiments (1935). He explains this as because a specific set of data may be unlikely (in the null hypothesis), but more extreme outcomes likely, so seen in this light, the specific but not extreme unlikely data should not be considered significant.  Specific tests  If the test statistic follows a Student's t-distribution in the null hypothesis ‚Äì which is common where the underlying variable follows a normal distribution with unknown scaling factor, then the test is referred to as a one-tailed or two-tailed t-test. If the test is performed using the actual population mean and variance, rather than an estimate from a sample, it would be called a one-tailed or two-tailed Z-test. The statistical tables for t and for Z provide critical values for both one- and two-tailed tests. That is, they provide the critical values that cut off an entire region at one or the other end of the sampling distribution as well as the critical values that cut off the regions (of half the size) at both ends of the sampling distribution.

The name is colloquially used today to describe the ribbon village along Bell Hill and Park Road in the Frome Valley. It borders Eastville to the South and Begbrook and Frenchay to the North. It comprises an eclectic mix of housing mainly from the Victorian, Edwardian, inter-war and late 20th century periods. It is a popular residential area on three counts. It is convenient for the M32 motorway (with rapid access the M4 and M5), it is a semi rural area within two miles of central Bristol and it boasts a popular public school. Stapleton's church is a prominent Bristol landmark, visible from the M32 motorway as motorists pass by.  History  The name is from the Old English word \\"stapol\\" meaning post and \\"ton\\" meaning settlement. The antiquary John Weever, quoting the 16th-century Tuscan merchant Lodovico Guicciardini, defined a staple town \\"to be a place, to which by the prince's authority and privilege wool, hides of beasts, wine, corn or grain, and other exotic or foreign merchandize are transferred, carried or conveyed to be sold\\".Weever, Antient Funeral Monuments, section \\"Within the Diocese of Rochester: Deptford\\" (1767 ed. p 134). In European historiography, the term \\"staple\\" refers to the entire medieval system of trade and its taxation. Under this system, the government or the ruler required that all overseas trade in certain goods be transacted at specific designated market \\"staple towns\\" or ports, referred to as the \\"staple ports\\". The ancient parish of Stapleton covered Fishponds and Eastville and was originally within Kingswood Forest. The Saxon hamlet of Stapleton, first documented in 1208, stood at the edge of the forest, just north of the River Frome. Finds of Roman coins point to even earlier habitation. Even in the 18th century, it was still heavily wooded. The hamlet was donated to Tewkesbury Abbey in 1174 by William, Earl of Gloucester. By the late 16th century, it was the property of the Berkeley family of Stoke Gifford, and was passed down to the Duke of Beaufort who retained the estate until the early 20th century, selling it in 1917. Stapleton was enclosed in 1781, Stapleton Common being sold as 9 lots, mostly to the Duke of Beaufort. Stapleton, then in Gloucestershire, became a civil parish in 1866, but in 1898 the parish was abolished and absorbed into Bristol.Vision of Britain: Stapleton AP/CP = Mining = Coal was mined in the area, there being some 70 pits by 1700, and vast numbers of local men were employed throughout the 18th century. In the 1890s, the mines produced a thousand tons per day.  Famous people  Frances Milton, the mother of Anthony Trollope was born in the village in 1780, and Sarah Young, the mother of Thomas Chatterton was also born there. The Indian social reformer Ram Mohan Roy died at Beech House, the home of Lant Carpenter, nursed by his daughter Mary in 1833. Roy had paid a brief visit to the House. The village grew steadily; in the 1871 census there were 6,960 inhabitants and by 1901 that had risen to 21,236.  Sport  In 1863 a cricket club was formed, its most famous player being Dr. William Gilbert Grace who played for Gloucestershire and England. At Purdown a football team called the Black Arabs were to become Bristol Rovers. (Purdown is reputedly haunted by the ghost of a Duchess of Beaufort who was struck by lightning, though many believe she died in a tragic horse riding accident.)  Transport  Also in the 19th century, two lines of the Great Western Railway were built through the area, meeting at Stapleton Road railway station which was opened on 8 September 1863. Tramways were also built, horse drawn at first, but then electric - they reached Fishponds in 1897. The village of Stapleton lies along the B4058 road but is now bypassed by the M32 motorway that runs to the West and North of the village. Junction 2 of this motorway is just south of the village and provides convenient access to the M4 and M5 motorways, respectively four and seven kilometres from the junction. This has helped provide rapid access to Cardiff and Newport in South Wales, the M4 Corridor towards London and the Birmingham area.  Buildings  = Stapleton Church = Altar and stained glass window, Holy Trinity, Stapleton History There has been a Church on this site for at least 500 years. The original dedication was to St. Giles, but between 1691 and 1720 the old Church was demolished and a new one, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, erected in its place. In 1854 the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol, Bishop Monk, whose official residence was what is now Colston's School, offered to rebuild the Church at his own cost, desiring ‚Äúmy fellow parishioners to understand that my motives in this work are to remove the source of dispute and contention for pews, caused by the inadequate size of the Church, and to provide sittings for the poor as well as other classes of Parishioners‚Äù. The Chancel was rebuilt at the cost of the lay rector, Greville Smyth, and the new Church was dedicated on 15 April 1857. The Choir Vestry was added in 1892. The Benefice At first the Church was the responsibility of the Benedictine monks of the Priory of St. James, who appointed chaplains. The first Vicar was instituted in 1540, after the dissolution of the monasteries. In 1544 St. James‚Äô Priory with all its assets, including the rectory and tithes of St. Giles‚Äô Church, was sold to Henry Brayne, a merchant tailor of London. In 1626 the Heath House estate, with the rectory and tithes, was bought by Thomas Walter, from whom they descended to the Smyth family of Ashton Court, as described in the tablet over the North Door. The lay rectory and tithes were surrendered by Greville Smyth in 1857, when the Vicar became the Rector, but the right of presentation to the benefice was retained by the family until 1948, when it was transferred to the Bishop of Bristol. The Church The Church is a fine example of Victorian Gothic architecture in the Decorated style. It was built of Pennant stone quarried locally at Broom Hill and the stone for the dressings came from quarries near Bath. Exterior The Tower with its spire is a commanding feature rising to a height of 170 feet. Coupled buttresses at its angles rise boldly in five stages to the rich parapet and are capped with crocketted pinnacles. These flank the spire whose eight angles are ornamented with crockets carved in Bath stone bands, the general facing being of Pennant stone in courses. A large metal cross surmounts the finial of the spire. At the foot of the Tower is the elaborately carved West Doorway. Interior The springing of the arches, the roof-corbels and window heads are enriched by fine carvings of heads, angels with musical instruments, and foliage. The whole of the roof is of oak, that in the chancel being ribbed and carved. Font This dates from 1857 and is of alabaster set on marble pillars. The oak cover is a memorial to two members of the Hall family who fell in the First World War. Pulpit This seems to have been made for some other church where the steps would have wound round a pillar. The Caenstone body rests on serpentine shafts with foliated capitals. and three of the panels contain carved representations of preaching ‚Äì Christ in the centre, and St Peter and St Paul on the left and right respectively. Lectern A fine brass eagle lectern given in memory of Charles Castle, died 1886. Choir Stalls Notable for the finely carved foliage and figures of kneeling angels. Reredos This was given by the Revd. W. H. Shaw at the time of the Church's jubilee in 1907. It shows Our Lord holding out His hands in invitation while angels stand or kneel on either side. Organ A two-manual instrument by Vowles of Bristol. Built in 1873, it now has electro-pneumatic action with 21 speaking stops. Lady Chapel The oak reredos and communion rail were given in memory of Lt. Fitzroy Charles Phillpotts, who fell at Gallipoli in 1915. Windows No two windows have the same tracery. Starting at the West end, and proceeding clockwise, the subjects are as follows: West. (Hardman) Bishop Monk kneels to offer a model of the Church to Christ on His throne.

On the West wall of the North Aisle are tablets erected by Jane Smyth to her mother and aunt, and another to the Revd. Henry Shute (the elder), Domestic Chaplain to the Dowager Duchess of Beaufort. Other tablets from the second Church are now on the inside walls of the Tower Bells A peal of six: Treble : 1872 2 : Undated 3 : Originally 1669 (From the first Church) Recast 1990 by Taylor's of Loughborough 4 : 1792 (From the second Church) 5 :1792 (From the second Church) Tenor : 1845 (From the second Church) Old Font The square font in the West porch has been dated to about 1000. When the second church was demolished this font was sold to Bishop Monk's former butler, who kept the Bell Inn, where it was used as a geranium pot. It was discovered and returned to the church by the Revd. W. H. Shaw (Rector 1891‚Äì1908). The font, of Dundry stone, has an overflow channel in one corner; other marks show where the hinges and lock were fitted for the font-cover, necessary to prevent the superstitious use of the consecrated water. Recent Improvements 1987: Gas central heating installed. Toilet adjoining Vestry. Access ramp by Vestry door with level approach and new opening to side of North Porch. 1993: Electric lighting, which had replaced gas in 1948, renewed. New floodlighting for spire. = Other Buildings = The church of St Thomas the Apostle in Eastville was consecrated in 1889 but is now a Pentecostal hall. Stapleton is home to Colston's School, a co-educational independent school named after the 17th century merchant and philanthropist Edward Colston. The school moved to the village in 1861 taking over a site in the west of the village that had previously been the Bishops' Palace and which has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II listed building, Further North is the Masonic Hall, home to the Filton Chapter of Freemasons Typical Villa-style home on Glendale Grange. In the mid-1990s a major development by the house builders Beazer Homes (now Persimmon plc)added over one hundred and fifty houses on the site of an old hospital between Bell Hill and the M32 motorway. These homes range from small two-bedroomed terraces to 4 and 5 bedroom villas. Also included was the refurbishment and development of Beech House (a former estate owner's home) into housing, and Linden House (a former farm house) into apartment accommodation. The development was known as Glendale Grange until incorporated into the village on its completion in 1999. Southern aspect of Beech House. Fayre on Stapleton Village Green. This development also gave the village a purpose built and substantial village green bounded by Baileys Mead Road (one of the main roads in the new part of the village) to the North and East and Beech House to the South. This green features a fully enclosed play park for younger children. The green plays host to many village and community events including Summer Fayres and barbecues, Christmas carol concerts. It now compromises the hub of the village. This part of the village is also home to New Friends Hall, a division of the North Bristol NHS Trust and also, across the motorway, Heath House Hospital, part of the Priory Group. On the hilltop to the north of the Priory buildings (on Purdown) is the Purdown BT Tower. It is one of twelve reinforced concrete towers owned by BT in the UK. It is used mainly for point-to-point microwave links and forms part of the British Telecom microwave network. Although not open to the public, public footpaths lead, via a bridge over the M32 motorway to the lands around the tower. BT Tower, Pur Down, as seen from Linden House, Stapleton.  Demography  In 2010 the village substantially comprises families who work locally or within the Greater Bristol area. Many of the working residents have technical positions within the University of the West of England, Ministry of Defence and Hewlett Packard, whose campuses are all within five kilometres of the centre of the village. The combination of easy access to the city and its major employers and lower than average congestion levels makes Stapleton an increasingly desirable place to live, pushing up house prices.

Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 387(13), 3242‚Äì3252. between adstratum languages, or as the result of migration, with an intrusive language acting as either a superstratum or a substratum. Language contact occurs in a variety of phenomena, including language convergence, borrowing and relexification. The most common products are pidgins, creoles, code-switching, and mixed languages. Other hybrid languages, such as English, do not strictly fit into any of these categories. In many other cases, contact between speakers occurs but the lasting effects on the language are less visible; they may, however, include loan words, calques or other types of borrowed material. Multilingualism has likely been common throughout much of human history, and today most people in the world are multilingual. A Global Perspective on Bilingualism and Bilingual Education (1999), G. Richard Tucker, Carnegie Mellon University Borrowing of vocabulary The most common way that languages influence each other is the exchange of words. Much is made about the contemporary borrowing of English words into other languages, but this phenomenon is not new, nor is it very large by historical standards. The large-scale importation of words from Latin, French and other languages into English in the 16th and 17th centuries was more significant. Some languages have borrowed so much that they have become scarcely recognizable. Armenian borrowed so many words from Iranian languages, for example, that it was at first considered a branch of the Indo-Iranian languages. It was not recognized as an independent branch of the Indo-European languages for many decades.Waterman, John (1976). A History of the German Language. University of Washington Press, p. 4 Adoption of other language features The influence can go deeper, extending to the exchange of even basic characteristics of a language such as morphology and grammar. Newar language, for example, spoken in Nepal, is a Sino-Tibetan language distantly related to Chinese but has had so many centuries of contact with neighbouring Indo-Iranian languages that it has even developed noun inflection, a trait that is typical of the Indo- European family but rare in Sino-Tibetan. It has absorbed features of grammar as well such as verb tenses. Also, Romanian was influenced by the Slavic languages spoken by neighbouring tribes in the centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire not only in vocabulary but also in the phonology. English has a few phrases, adapted from French, in which the adjective follows the noun: court-martial, attorney-general, Lake Superior. It is easy to see how a word can diffuse from one language to another, but it is not as obvious how more basic features can do the same even if the latter phenomenon is not rare. Language shift The result of the contact of two languages can be the replacement of one by the other. This is most common when one language has a higher social position (prestige). This sometimes leads to language endangerment or extinction. Stratal influence When language shift occurs, the language that is replaced (known as the substratum) can leave a profound impression on the replacing language (known as the superstratum), when people retain features of the substratum as they learn the new language and pass these features on to their children, leading to the development of a new variety. For example, the Latin that came to replace local languages in present-day France during Roman times was influenced by Gaulish and Germanic. The distinct pronunciation of the Hiberno English dialect spoken in Ireland comes partially from the influence of the substratum of Irish. Outside the Indo-European family, Coptic, the last stage of ancient Egyptian, is a substratum of Egyptian Arabic.  Creation of new languages: creolization and mixed languages  Language contact can also lead to the development of new languages when people without a common language interact closely. Resulting from this contact a pidgin may develop, which may eventually become a full- fledged creole language through the process of creolization (though some linguists assert that a creole need not emerge from a pidgin). Prime examples of this are Aukan and Saramaccan, spoken in Suriname, which have vocabulary mainly from Portuguese, English and Dutch. A much rarer but still observed process, according to some linguists, is the formation of mixed languages. Whereas creoles are formed by communities lacking a common language, mixed languages are formed by communities fluent in both languages. They tend to inherit much more of the complexity (grammatical, phonological, etc.) of their parent languages, whereas creoles begin as simple languages and then develop in complexity more independently. It is sometimes explained as bilingual communities that no longer identify with the cultures of either of the languages they speak, and seek to develop their own language as an expression of their own cultural uniqueness.  Mutual and non-mutual influence  Change as a result of contact is often one-sided. Chinese, for instance, has had a profound effect on the development of Japanese, but Chinese remains relatively free of Japanese influence other than some modern terms that were reborrowed after they were coined in Japan and based on Chinese forms and using Chinese characters. In India, Hindi and other native languages have been influenced by English, and loanwords from English are part of everyday vocabulary. In some cases, language contact may lead to mutual exchange, but that may be confined to a particular geographic region. For example, in Switzerland, the local French has been influenced by German and vice versa. In Scotland, Scots has been heavily influenced by English, and many Scots terms have been adopted into the regional English dialect.  Linguistic hegemony  A language's influence widens as its speakers grow in power. Chinese, Greek, Latin, Portuguese, French, Spanish, Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit, Russian, German and English have each seen periods of widespread importance and have had varying degrees of influence on the native languages spoken in the areas over which they have held sway. Especially during and since the 1990s, the internet, along with previous influences such as radio and television, telephone communication and printed materials, has expanded and changed the many ways in which languages can be influenced by each other and by technology.  Dialectal and sub-cultural change  Some forms of language contact affect only a particular segment of a speech community. Consequently, change may be manifested only in particular dialects, jargons, or registers. South African English, for example, has been significantly affected by Afrikaans in terms of lexis and pronunciation, but the other dialects of English have remained almost totally unaffected by Afrikaans other than a few loanwords. In some cases, a language develops an acrolect that contains elements of a more prestigious language. For example, in England during a large part of the Middle Ages, upper-class speech was dramatically influenced by French to the point that it often resembled a French dialect. Methods from sociolinguistics, the study of language use in society, are used effectively in the study of language contact in communities.Gooden, Shelome. \\"Language Contact in a Sociolinguistics Context.\\" in The Routledge Companion to the Work of John R. Rickford (2019). The broader study of contact varieties within a society is called linguistic ecology.See, for example, Mufwene, Salikoko S. The ecology of language evolution. Cambridge University Press, 2001. Sign languages Language contact is extremely common in most deaf communities, which are almost always located within a dominant oral language culture. It can also take place between two or more sign languages, and the expected contact phenomena occur: lexical borrowing, foreign \\"accent\\", interference, code switching, pidgins, creoles, and mixed systems. However, between a sign language and an oral language, even if lexical borrowing and code switching also occur, the interface between the oral and signed modes produces unique phenomena: fingerspelling, fingerspelling/sign combination, initialisation, CODA talk, TDD conversation, mouthing and contact signing.

As a youth in Ireland, he was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, or Fenians, for which he was transported to Western Australia. After escaping to the United States, he became a prominent spokesperson for the Irish community and culture, through his editorship of the Boston newspaper The Pilot, his prolific writing, and his lecture tours. Born in Dowth, O'Reilly moved to his aunt's residence in England as a teenager and became involved in journalism and shortly after became involved in the military. He, however, left the military in 1863 after becoming angry with the military's treatment of the Irish, and returned to Ireland the same year. In 1864 he joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood under an assumed name and was part of the group for two years until he and many others were arrested by authorities in early 1866. After a trial the same year he was sentenced to death which was later commuted to 20 years' penal servitude. In 1867 O'Reilly was transported to Western Australia and moved to the town of Bunbury where he escaped two years later. He was assisted in escaping by a Fr. Patrick, McCabe from Arnaghan, Gowna, Co. Cavan. After the escape O'Reilly moved to Boston and embarked on a successful writing and journalism career that produced works such as Moondyne (1879) and Songs from the Southern Seas (1873), and poems such as The Cry of the Dreamer and The White Rose and In Bohemia. He married Mary Murphy in 1872 and had four daughters. In the last 4 years of his life he suffered various health issues before dying of an overdose in his summer home in Hull, Massachusetts in 1890. His memorial service held at Tremont Temple was a major public event. O'Reilly's literature and work with civil rights have been celebrated throughout the years.  Early life  O'Reilly was born on 28 June 1844, at Dowth Castle to William David O'Reilly (1808‚Äì1871) and Eliza O'Reilly (n√©e Boyle) (1815‚Äì1868) near Drogheda. His father was a headmaster. He was the third child out of six. Ireland was at that time a part of the United Kingdom, and many Irish people bitterly resented British rule. There was a strong nationalist movement. O'Reilly's relatively wealthy family was fiercely patriotic; his mother was closely related to nationalist John Allen, who had played an important role in Robert Emmet's rising in 1803. A year after O'Reilly's birth, the Great Famine began, an event that would shape O'Reilly's life and beliefs. Most of O'Reilly's closest family managed to survive the famine, however many of O'Reilly's classmates lost their lives to the famine. The son of a schoolmaster, O'Reilly received a good early education. When he was about thirteen, his older brother contracted tuberculosis, and O'Reilly took his place as apprentice at a local newspaper. = England = In 1859, at the age of fifteen, O'Reilly moved to Preston, Lancashire to live with his aunt Christina and uncle James Watkinson, a sea master, after being convinced by his uncle to travel back with him to England to visit. He took up work on local newspaper the Preston Guardian. In June 1861, O'Reilly enrolled in the 11th Lancashire Rifle Volunteers, with which he received some military training. On returning to Ireland in March, 1863, he enlisted with the 10th Hussars in Dublin. While O'Reilly was in the army he began to witness the treatment and oppression of his fellow citizens in Ireland, these events influenced his opinion on the army and England and a had massive emotional impact on O'Reilly and he was determined to take action.  Irish Republican Brotherhood  = Irish Republican Brotherhood and arrest = Photograph of imprisoned O'Reilly, 1866 In 1864, O'Reilly joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood, then commonly known as the \\"Fenians\\", a secret society of rebels dedicated to an armed uprising against British rule. He turned his energies to recruiting more Fenians within his regiment, bringing in up to 80 new members. He presented himself to conspirators in Clonmel under the false name of Kelly. He assisted in recruiting Irish young men and soldiers to the Brotherhood. In February 1866, O'Reilly along with many other Fenians were arrested and sent to Arbor Hill military prison. On 27 June 1866 (the eve of his 22nd birthday) O'Reilly's trial by court martial began; he was charged with treason. He was found guilty and sentenced to death, but due to his age the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and later 20 years' penal servitude. From that point on he spent around 15 months in some of England's most notorious prisons such as Millbank, Pentonville and Dartmoor. During this time O'Reilly attempted to escape twice but was quickly recaptured and placed in solitary confinement. = Transportation and life in Australia = On 10 October 1867, O'Reilly was placed in chains and marched off to the convict ship Hougoumont along with 61 other Fenian prisoners and 218 common criminals for transportation to the British colony of Western Australia. Midway through the voyage, O'Reilly and another prisoner John Flood, established a handwritten newspaper called The Wild Goose which contained poetry, stories and anecdotes from members of the ship's convict fraternity. Seven editions were produced, and the single copy of the original set survives and is held in the State Library of New South Wales collection. The Hougoumonts passage was the last convict ship transport to Western Australia. Perth Gazette and West Australian Times, 17 January 1868, announcing the arrival of the Hougoumont in Fremantle After arriving in Fremantle on 9 January 1868, O'Reilly was admitted to the Convict Establishment (now Fremantle Prison), but after a month he was transferred to Bunbury. He was assigned to a party of convicts tasked with building the Bunbury‚ÄìBusselton road. One day while clearing the bush in Bunbury to make way for a new road, O'Reilly refused to be a member of a party of convict road gang ordered to cut down a huge tuart tree standing in the way of the new road. O'Reilly's action to save the tree soon came to the attention of the warder's wife Selina. And it wasn't too long before the word had spread throughout the district that a convict has disobeyed orders. Eventually, the tree was saved and the new road given a slight curve around the tree. O'Reilly quickly developed a good relationship with his warder Henry Woodman, and was appointed probationary convict constable. As assistant to the warder, he did record and account keeping, ordering of stores, and other minor administrative duties. He was frequently used as a messenger, which required him to travel regularly between the work camp and the district convict prison in Bunbury. The warder apparently used O'Reilly to maintain contact with his family, for the prisoner became a regular visitor to the Woodman family home, and at some point he began a romantic liaison with Woodman's daughter Jessie. This ended badly, at least for O'Reilly; he wrote poetry expressing his agony of mind, and hints at romantic causes. On 27 December 1868, O'Reilly attempted suicide by cutting the veins of his left arm. After falling into a faint from loss of blood, he was discovered by another convict, and his life was saved.Evans pp. 128‚Äì31 According to a letter discovered in 2015, Jessie Woodman became pregnant with O'Reilly's child (this has been said to be a factor in O'Reilly's suicide attempt). Most accounts say that Woodman had the child after O'Reilly escaped and it died shortly after. Woodman's father Henry eventually found out about the relationship and married Jessie off to local 22-year-old George Pickersgill in March 1869. (O'Reilly was either still hiding from authorities or on his way to America during this time.)  Escape  While in Bunbury, O'Reilly formed a strong friendship with the local Roman Catholic priest, Father Patrick McCabe. Late in 1868, McCabe offered to arrange for O'Reilly to escape the colony. By February, McCabe's plan was ready for execution. On 18 February 1869, O'Reilly absconded from his work party and met up with James Maguire, a local settler from the town of Dardanup. Together they rode to Geographe Bay where a rowboat was waiting for them. They rowed out into the Indian Ocean. O'Reilly hid in the dunes, awaiting the departure from Bunbury of the American whaling ship Vigilant, which Father McCabe had arranged would take him on board. The ship was sighted the next day, and the party rowed out to it, but the captain reneged on the agreement, and the Vigilant sailed off without acknowledging the people in the rowboat. O'Reilly had to return to the shore and hide again while his friends tried to make arrangements with another ship. After two weeks, they succeeded in making a deal with the captain of the American whaler Gazelle. O'Reilly and his friends met the Gazelle three miles out to sea on 2 March, and he was taken on board. With him was a ticket of leave convict named Martin Bowman (alias for Thomas Henderson), who had heard of the intended escape. He had blackmailed the conspirators into allowing him to join O'Reilly. While on the Gazelle, O'Reilly became friends with the first mate of the ship Henry Hathaway, and they remained good friends until O'Reilly's death. Hathaway saved O'Reilly's life when, while whaling on a lifeboat near the Gazelle, a wave hit the boat and O'Reilly was knocked unconscious. Hathaway saved his life by performing CPR. McCabe had arranged for the Gazelle to take O'Reilly only as far as Java, but adverse weather prevented the ship's finding safe passage through the Sunda Strait. The captain decided to sail for Roderiquez, Mauritius, at that time a British colony. As soon as the Gazelle arrived at Roderiquez, it was boarded by a magistrate and a contingent of police, who claimed to have information that the Gazelle carried an escaped convict from Western Australia, and demanded that he be given up. The crew gave up Bowman, but denied having O'Reilly on board. The Gazelles next port of call was to be Saint Helena, another British colony. The captain recommended that O'Reilly transfer to another ship before then. On 29 July, the Gazelle met the American cargo vessel Sapphire on the high seas, and O'Reilly changed ships. The Sapphire arrived at Liverpool on 13 October, and O'Reilly transferred to another American ship, the Bombay. The Bombay docked in Philadelphia on 23 November 1869, where O'Reilly was enthusiastically welcomed by Irish compatriots. Shortly after O'Reilly arrived in Philadelphia he went to New York where he was invited to deliver a lecture in the Cooper Institute which he delivered on 16 December 1869. While there he recounted details of the escape. O'Reilly quickly realised that New York did not offer any field for his ambitions and he was advised to move to Boston, which he did, arriving there on 2 January 1870. = 1870‚Äì1890: Writing and journalism career =  1870‚Äì1874: Early years, Fenian invasion of Canada and Songs From the Southern Seas  O'Reilly settled in Charlestown, a neighbourhood in Boston, which had a large Irish community. He gave his first lecture in the United States on 31 January 1870 on \\"England's Political Prisoners\\". The lecture was a success and O'Reilly was invited to repeat it in Salem, Providence and other areas. A bit later that year he was given the position as a reporter with The Pilot. In June, 1870 O'Reilly travelled to Canada to cover the Fenian Invasion of Canada, there he met General John O'Neill. O'Reilly was on the front line at every event during the failed invasion including O'Neill's arrest. The coverage was O'Reilly's first major work on The Pilot.  Marriage and family  On August 15, 1872 O'Reilly married Mary Murphy (1850-1897), a journalist who wrote for the Young Crusader under the name of Agnes Smiley. They had four daughters: Mary, Eliza, Agnes and Blanid. Their eldest daughter, Mary Boyle O'Reilly, was a journalist and war correspondent before and during World War I. The third daughter, Agnes O'Reilly, went on to marry the philosopher William Ernest Hocking soon after he earned his PhD from Harvard University, where he would later teach. A decade later when they returned to Cambridge, Agnes started an open-air school that developed into Shady Hill School. It continues today near Harvard Square. Their three children were Richard, Joan, and Hester.  Catalpa rescue  In 1875, John Devoy sought O'Reilly's advice on how the Clan na Gael might rescue the six military Fenians serving time in Western Australia. The first plan was to storm Fremantle Prison and rescue the Fenians by force of arms; O'Reilly rejected that. He suggested that a rescue party pick up the escapees according to a prearranged plan. He also recommended their buying a whaling ship for the purpose, as it could have an appearance of legitimate business in Fremantle. O'Reilly's plan was adopted, and ultimately led to the Catalpa rescue. The escape was successful and O'Reilly was given the news of the escape in June 1876.  Poetry  O'Reilly published his first book of poems, Songs from the Southern Seas, in 1873. Over the next fifteen years, he published three collections of poetry, a novel, and a treatise on health and exercise. His poetry was extremely popular, and he was often commissioned to write poems for important commemorative occasions. By the late twentieth century, most of his earlier work was dismissed as popular verse, but some of his later, more introspective poetry, such as his best-known poem, The Cry of the Dreamer, is still highly regarded. At the dedication for the memorial to Crispus Attucks on 14 November 1888, O'Reilly read his poem dedicated to Attucks aloud. In his later years, O'Reilly became prone to illness, and suffered from bouts of insomnia. He published his final poem, The Useless Ones, in The Pilot on 1 February 1890.  Death  On August 9, 1890, O'Reilly took an early boat to his residence in Hull, Massachusetts. He had been suffering from bouts of insomnia during this time. That evening he took a long walk with his brother-in-law John R. Murphy hoping that physical fatigue would induce the needed sleep. Later on that night he took some of his wife's sleeping medicine, which contained chloral hydrate. On the morning of 10 August around 2 to 3 a.m. his wife woke up and found O'Reilly sitting in a chair, with one hand resting on the table near a book, and a cigar in the other. O'Reilly was found to be unconscious, His wife sent a servant for the family's physician Dr Litchfield, He spent nearly an hour trying to revive him, but O'Reilly died shortly before 5 a.m. Public announcements attributed O'Reilly's death to heart failure, but the official death register claims \\"accidental poisoning\\". = Grief and tributes = O'Reilly's grave, circa 1891 O'Reilly's sudden death received an outpouring of grief and tributes from the Boston community and also globally, The Pilot published a full biography of O'Reilly's life in their 16 August edition, Cardinal James Gibbons said upon hearing the news, \\"It is a public calamity‚Äînot only a loss to the country, but a loss to the Church, and to humanity in general.\\" Grover Cleveland wrote \\"I have heard with sincere regret that John Boyle O'Reilly is dead. I regarded him as a strong and able man, entirely devoted to any cause he espoused, unselfish in his activity, true and warm in his friendship, and patriotic in his enthusiasm.\\" George Frisbie Hoar sent a telegram to O'Reilly's wife saying \\"Accept my profound sympathy in your great loss and the great public loss. Your husband combined, as no other man, some of the noblest qualities of the Irishman and the American.\\" His parish priest Rev. J. W. McMahon of St. Mary's Church, Charlestown said, \\"I have always had a great admiration for the man ever since he came to my parish as a member. As for his career before that time that, too, commands my respect and admiration. He was a single-minded, open-hearted man‚Äîa man who loved liberty for itself, and who wished everybody to have a fair chance. He was a good husband, a good father, a good Catholic and a good man.\\" Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote, \\"John Boyle O'Reilly was a man of heroic mold and nature; brave, adventurous, patriotic, enthusiastic, with the perfervidum ingenium, which belongs quite as much to the Irish as to the Scotch. We have been proud of him as an adopted citizen, feeling always that his native land could ill spare so noble a son. His poems show what he might have been had he devoted himself to letters. His higher claim is that he was a true and courageous lover of his country and of his fellow, men\\".http://rachel.golearn.us:81/wikisource_en_all_2016-04/A/Life_of_John_Boyle_O'Reilly_Chapter_19.html Boston mayor Thomas N. Hart along with many other identities in Boston and Ireland also paid tribute. = Funeral and memorial service = His funeral on 13 August held at St Mary's Church in Charlestown was attended by thousands. The streets near the church were lined with mourners. The bearers were O'Donovan Rossa, Jeremiah O' Donovan, Michael Fitzgerald, James A. Wrenn, Capt. Lawrence O'Brien, and Denis Cashman. His wife did not attend the funeral due to grief and was unable to leave her bed. On 2 September, a public memorial service was held at Tremont Temple in Boston, the service was attended by dozens. The speakers included, Mayor Thomas Hart, Charles Levi Woodbury (son of Levi Woodbury), Rev William Byrne. Charles H. Taylor, Benjamin Butler, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Edwin Walker and Patrick Collins. O'Reilly was originally buried at Calvary Cemetery in Roxbury, but in November 1890 his remains were exhumed and moved to Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline.  Legacy and honours  In 1891, James Jeffrey Roche, O'Reilly's assistant editor of the Boston Pilot, published a biography of O'Reilly's life titled Life of John Boyle O'Reilly. O'Reilly became one of the most famous and respected journalists and writers in the United States. O'Reilly's civil rights activism garnered a lot of attention at the time, in 1945 The Crisis described O'Reilly as > \\"O'Reilly defended the oppressed negroes, as he had defended the oppressed > Indians, as sincerely and zealously as he had all his life defended the > oppressed of his own race. It was morally impossible for him to do > otherwise. On 20 June 1896 (nearly a week before what would have been his 52nd birthday), a multi-figure bronze sculpture of O'Reilly was unveiled, then-President Grover Cleveland gave a speech at the event. John Boyle O'Reilly monument, Boston, by Daniel Chester French, 1896 O'Reilly's admirers included poets and politicians such as Walt Whitman, James Whitcomb Riley, Oscar Wilde, John F. Kennedy, Grover Cleveland and Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. The John Boyle O'Reilly Club opened in 1880 in Springfield, Massachusetts. They celebrated their 125th anniversary in 2005. In the early 1900s, Boyle O'Reilly Terrace, an estate built on the north side of Dundalk, was named after him. Around the mid-1980s, Irish researcher Liam Barry (based in Bunbury) discovered the story of O'Reilly's escape and began to research more into it and promote the story. Before his death in 2015 he published multiple books on O'Reilly and the Fenians. Around 1987 The John Boyle O'Reilly Association of Bunbury, Western Australia was founded, Barry was one of the founding members. In 2002 an interpretative display was opened for John Boyle O'Reilly, in Western Australia on the Leschenault Peninsula Conservation Park, from where he escaped to the United States.http://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx?ItemId=121043&page;=4 In April 2011 The John Boyle O'Reilly Association was established in Netterville his ancestral home, near Drogheda, Ireland. J.B. O'Reilly's pub in West Leederville, Western Australia is named after O'Reilly. In 2019, a festival was held in Fremantle to commemorate the 150th anniversary of O'Reilly's escape titled the Moondyne Walk, where a series of different readers would read out a chapter of his 1879 novel Moondyne. The list of readers included former Western Australian premier Peter Dowding, epidemiologist Fiona Stanley, author and journalist Peter FitzSimons and actor Peter Rowsthorn.  Pardon request  In 1999 then-Western Australian opposition leader, Geoff Gallop, made an unsuccessful request to British Prime Minister and friend Tony Blair to grant O'Reilly a pardon.

The Dunedin cable tramway system was a group of cable tramway lines in the New Zealand city of Dunedin. It is significant as Dunedin was the second city in the world to adopt the cable car (the first being San Francisco).  History  The first Dunedin cable car line opened in 1881, the engineer responsible being George Smith Duncan. For this system he introduced the pull curve and the slot brake; the former was a way to pull cars through a curve, since Dunedin's curves were too steep to allow coasting, while the latter forced a wedge down into the cable slot to stop the tram, which was deemed necessary after the line had a runaway tram some two months after it opened. The last line closed on 2 March 1957. Lines = Roslyn and Kaikorai = Dunedin's first cable car served Roslyn (although initially only going as far as the Town Belt), covering a distance of , opening on 6 February 1881. The line went up Rattray Street, with the world's first pull curve in front of St Joseph's Cathedral. It then cut through the Town Belt in Belleknowes (where the cutting is still generally visible) past the Beverly-Begg Observatory to climb the full length of Ross Street and part of Belgrave Crescent, then descend through a cutting to the valley near Frasers Road. The last cable car ran on this line on 25 October 1951.The Evening Star, 26 October 1951 The western section beyond the cutting was too steep for a road link, so, when the cable cars ceased, the portion near Belgrave Crescent was redeveloped as a short street serving several houses while retaining the pedestrian walkway through to Delta Street. Trolleybuses replaced the service as far as Belgrave Crescent, using City Road instead of the straight steep cutting through the Town Belt. = Stuart Street = Travelling a distance of , the Stuart Street line opened on 6 October 1900, running largely parallel to the Roslyn line. The track went up Stuart Street from The Octagon, turned half-right at York Place into what was then called Albert Street, continued on past the end of that street through a short section of Town Belt, past Otago Boys' High School, across the bottom of Littlebourne Crescent and up to Highgate at School Street, then dropped down to Kaikorai just before Nairn Street, where a turntable in the road turned cars through 90¬∞ and sent them south-west into their shed. The route was eventually turned into a four-lane highway, cutting Littlebourne Crescent off from Littlebourne Road, going under a new bridge and undergoing considerable widening on the Kaikorai side, restricting access to Ann Street and Oates Street. It closed on 31 July 1947. = Mornington = Opening on 23 March 1883, the Mornington line travelled up High Street to Mornington. This line was the steepest recorded tramline in the world, with a gradient at the highest point of the track measured at 1 in 3.75. The Mornington line was the last to close, on 2 March 1957, leaving San Francisco with the only operational cable car system in the world. Cable Car House (now used by the Mornington Health Centre after the Plumbers moved out) is still clearly marked in the shopping area, having had little external changes since the line closed. In 2013, a local group announced plans to reinstate this line. The project, estimated to cost $22m, would include a terminus near Mornington Park containing a cafe, museum and storage area for the cable car. = Maryhill Extension = The Maryhill Extension exited from the back of the Mornington cable car house at the end of Henderson St, following Glenpark Avenue for . The line was perfectly straight, and was sometimes referred to as The Big Dipper, similar to a roller coaster, going steeply down one side of the valley and then up the other side. It opened on 18 March 1885 and closed on 29 October 1955. The line was originally operated using two grip trams which were later destroyed by a fire. Later, the line was operated by the former Elgin Road grip tram, DCCT No 106. When this car was being overhauled, it would be replaced by 'convertible' grip tram No 105, which was used as a spare car on the Mornington and Maryhill lines as its grip could be set at two different heights to allow it to run on either line. Grip tram 106 was withdrawn in 1955 and donated to the Otago Early Settlers Museum where it remains on static display. 'Convertible' grip tram 105 remained in service on the Mornington line until the closure of the Mornington line in 1957 when it was donated in working order to the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine, where it is stored in a complete state along with its grip. = Elgin Road Extension = The Elgin Road Extension also left the Mornington cable car house, going up Mailer Street and then following Elgin Road for a total of . It opened on 6 October 1906, and closed only four years later, on 22 January 1910. In contrast to Dunedin's other cable car lines, there was very little gradient on this line. However, the line featured a number of very sharp curves which caused the rope to wear out much faster than those on the other lines. The Elgin Road grip tram was transferred to the Maryhill line and eventually became DCCT No 106. It is preserved in Toit≈´ Otago Settlers Museum as it would have looked in 1955 when it was withdrawn.

Carl Linnaeus and the comte de Buffon reckoned him the father of natural history studies. He is usually referred to, especially in older scientific literature in Latin, as Aldrovandus; his name in Italian is equally given as Aldroandi.  Life  Aldrovandi was born in Bologna to Teseo Aldrovandi and his wife, a noble but poor family. His father was a lawyer, and Secretary to the Senate of Bologna, but died when Ulisse was seven years old. However, when Pope Gregory XIII, a member of Ulisse's mother's family was elected in 1570, the family's fortune improved. His widowed mother wanted him to become a jurist. Initially he was sent to apprentice with merchants as a scribe for a short time when he was 14 years old, but he found his vocation, after studying mathematics, Latin, law, and philosophy, initially at the University of Bologna, and then at the University of Padua in 1545 and becoming a notary. His interests successively extended to philosophy and logic, which he combined with the study of medicine. In June 1549, Aldrovandi was accused and arrested for heresy on account of his espousing of the anti-trinitarian beliefs of the Anabaptist Camillo Renato. By September, he had published an abjuration, but was transferred to Rome, and remained in custody or house arrest until absolved in April, 1550. During this time, he befriended many local scholars. While in light captivity there, he became more and more interested in botany, zoology, and geology (he is credited for the invention/first written record of this word). From 1551 onward, he organized a variety of expeditions to the Italian mountains, countryside, islands, and coasts to collect and catalogue plants. He obtained a degree in medicine and philosophy in 1553 and started teaching logic and philosophy in 1554 at the University of Bologna. In 1559, he became professor of philosophy and in 1561 he became the first professor of natural sciences at Bologna (lectura philosophiae naturalis ordinaria de fossilibus, plantis et animalibus). Aldrovandi was a friend of Francesco de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany (1574 ‚Äì 1587), visiting his garden at Pratolino and travelling with him, compiling a list of the most valuable plants at Pratolino. He also formed fruitful associations with botanical artists such as Jacopo Ligozzi, to further develop illustrated texts. He died in Bologna on 4 May 1605, at the age of 82.  Work  Monstrorum Historia Over the course of his life, he would assemble one of the most spectacular cabinets of curiosities: his \\"theatre\\" illuminating natural history comprising some 7000 specimens of the diversit√† di cose naturali, of which he wrote a description in 1595. Between 1551 and 1554, he organized several expeditions to collect plants for a herbarium, among the first botanizing expeditions. Eventually, his herbarium contained about 4760 dried specimens on 4117 sheets in sixteen volumes, preserved at the University of Bologna. He also had various artists including Jacopo Ligozzi, Giovanni Neri, and Cornelio Schwindt, compose illustrations of specimens. =Botanic garden= At his demand and under his direction, a public botanic garden was created in Bologna in 1568, now the Orto Botanico dell'Universit√† di Bologna. Due to a dispute on the composition of a popular medicine with the pharmacists and doctors of Bologna in 1575, he was suspended from all public positions for five years. In 1577, he sought the aid of Pope Gregory XIII (a cousin of his mother), who wrote to the authorities of Bologna to reinstate Aldrovandi in his public offices and request financial aid to help him publish his books. =Collections= His vast collections in botany and zoology he willed to the Senate of Bologna; until 1742 the collections were conserved in the Palazzo Pubblico, then in the Palazzo Poggi, but were distributed among various libraries and institutions in the course of the nineteenth century. In 1907 a representative part were reunited at Palazzo Poggi, Bologna, where the 400th anniversary of his death was memorialized in a celebrative exhibition in 2005. =Neurofibromatosis= He was the first to have extensively documented the neurofibromatosis disease, a type of skin tumour. Recently, however, it has been observed that in a work by Andrea Mantegna's, this type of disease had been pictured 80 years earlier than in Androvandi's work. = List of selected publications = Of the several hundred books and essays he wrote, only a handful were published during his lifetime: *Antidotarii Bononiensis, siue de vsitata ratione componendorum, miscendorumque medicamentorum, epitome (1574) *Ornithologiae hoc est de avibus historiae libri XII (Bologna, 1599) 1637 edition * Ornithologiae tomus alter cum indice copiosissimo (Bologna, 1600) * De animalibus insectis libri septem, cum singulorum iconibus ad viuum expressis (Bologna, 1602) 1637 edition * Ornithologiae tomus tertius, ac postremus (Bologna, 1603) 1637 edition * De reliquis animalibus exanguibus libri quatuor (Bologna, 1606) * De piscibus libri V, et De cetis lib. vnus (Bologna, 1613) * Quadrupedum omnium bisulcorum historia (Bologna, 1621) * Serpentum, et draconum (Bologna, 1640) (Natural History of Snakes and Dragons) * Monstrorum historia cum Paralipomenis historiae omnium animalium (Bologna, 1642) ‚Äì digital edition by the University and State Library D√ºsseldorf (Bononiae, 1658) * Musaeum metallicum in libros IV distributum Bartholomaeus Ambrosinus (Bologna, 1648) * Dendrologiae naturalis scilicet arborum historiae libri duo sylua glandaria, acinosumq (Bologna, 1667) . * Observationes Variae Bologna, Biblioteca Universitaria, Ms. 136, XI folio 73 Honors * The wrinkle ridge Dorsa Aldrovandi on the Moon is named after him. * The Civico Orto Botanico \\"Ulisse Aldrovandi\\" in San Giovanni in Persiceto is named in his honor. * The plant genus Aldrovanda is named after him.

Biography Egg was born to Joseph and Ann Egg, and baptised in St James's Church, Piccadilly, on 30 May 1816. He had an elder brother, George Hine Egg. His father Joseph Egg was a wealthy gunsmith from the distinguished gun making family, who immigrated to London from Huningue, Alsace.Hilarie Faberman, ‚ÄòEgg, Augustus Leopold (1816‚Äì1863)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004 Egg was educated in the schools of the Royal Academy, beginning in 1836. Egg was a member of The Clique, a group of artists founded by Richard Dadd and others in the late 1830s (c. 1837). Egg sought to combine popularity with moral and social activism, in line with the literary work of his friend Charles Dickens. With Dickens he set up the \\"Guild of Literature and Art\\", a philanthropic organisation intended to provide welfare payments to struggling artists and writers. He acted the lead role in \\"Not So Bad As We Seem,\\" a play written by Edward Bulwer-Lytton to raise funds for the organisation. His self-portrait in the role is in Hospitalfield House in Arbroath. Egg's early paintings were generally illustrations of literary subjects. Like other members of The Clique, he saw himself as a follower of Hogarth. His interest in Hogarthian moral themes is evidenced in his paired paintings The Life and Death of Buckingham, depicting the dissolute life and sordid death of the Restoration rake George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. Yet his paintings often took a humorous look at their subjects, as in his Queen Elizabeth Discovers she is no longer Young (1848). Style Unlike most other members of The Clique, Egg also admired the Pre-Raphaelites; he bought work from the young William Holman Hunt and shared ideas on color theory with him. His own triptych, known as Past and Present, was influenced by Hunt's work. The triptych depicted three separate scenes, one portraying a prosperous middle-class family and the other two depicting poor and isolated figures -- two young girls in a bedsit and a homeless woman with a baby. The viewer was expected to read a series of visual clues that linked together these three scenes, to reveal that the prosperous family in the central scene is in the process of disintegrating because of the mother's adultery. The two outer scenes depict the separated mother and children a few years later, now living in poverty. The painting's use of flashback -- the central scene is occurring in the past -- has been seen as a precursor of cinema. Augustus Egg, The Travelling Companions (1862; Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery). Egg was also an active organiser of exhibitions, being admired by fellow-artists for his dedication and fair mindedness. He was one of the organisers of the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in 1857. He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1860. Always in poor health, Egg spent his later years in the warmer climate of continental Europe, where he painted Travelling Companions, an ambiguous image of two near-identical young women that has sometimes been interpreted as an attempt to represent two sides of the same person. A member of the circle of friends that included Dickens and Wilkie Collins, Egg features in their surviving correspondence. He participated, as actor and costume designer, in their amateur theatricals, which were often conducted for charitable purposes as noted above. In January 1857 he took a part in Collins's play The Frozen Deep, which starred Dickens and was performed at his home, Tavistock House (Egg played John Want, the ship's cook.) The production was also acted before Queen Victoria and then performed for charity. Dickens described Egg as a \\"dear gentle little fellow,\\" \\"always sweet-tempered, humorous, conscientious, thoroughly good, and thoroughly beloved.\\"Ley, p. 283. In a 1953 radio interview, Evelyn Waugh was asked \\"What painters do you admire most?\\".

Mary Fischer, (Ashgate Publishing, 2010), 120. He was the first major noble to join the military order. Conrad was the youngest son of Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia,Nicholas Morton, The Teutonic Knights in the Holy Land, 1190-1291, (Boydell Press, 2009), 85. and Sophia, a daughter of Otto I, Duke of Bavaria.Jonathan R. Lyon, \\"Princely Brothers and Sisters: The Sibling Bond in German Politics, 1100-1250\\", Cornell Press, 243 His elder brother Louis IV of Thuringia was married to Saint Elisabeth of Hungary. When Louis died in 1227 during the Sixth Crusade, his brother Henry Raspe became regent for Louis' minor son Herman II, and Conrad took on the title of Count of Gudensberg in Hesse, assisting his brother in ruling the area. On Elisabeth's death in 1231, Henry Raspe took Thuringia for himself, and together with Conrad, worked to consolidate power. Conrad engaged in battle a number of times with Siegfried III, Archbishop of Mainz, at one point personally swinging him around and threatening to cut him in two. In 1232, he besieged the city of Fritzlar, massacring its populace and burning the church.Nicholas Morton, The Medieval Military Orders: 1120-1314, (Routledge, 2013), 95. Elisabeth had founded a hospital in Marburg and had intended to bequeath it to the Johanniter Order, but this was rejected by her defensor, Conrad of Marburg. Pope Gregory IX sent a commission to settle the matter, and it decided in favor of Conrad of Marburg on 2 August 1232. In the summer of 1234, Conrad travelled to Rome and convinced the Curia to turn the hospital and parish church in Marburg over to the Teutonic Knights, which had founded a house in the city the previous year. In November, Conrad set aside his temporal title and entered the Teutonic Order himself. The next year, he joined the commission to Rome that represented his sister-in-law in the canonization process, and he remained in the court of the Pope until Pentecost of 1235 when she was declared a saint. Upon the death of Hermann von Salza, Conrad became the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights.Germany in the Reign of Frederick II, Austin Lane Poole, The Cambridge Medieval History, Vol. IV, ed. J.R.

The film starred Warlpiri people and was filmed in and around Yuendumu, a large mainly Indigenous town in the Northern Territory of Australia. An touring exhibition based on the series toured Australian museums from 2018 to 2019, with a book published to accompany it in 2017. Description Bush Mechanics is a four-part television series directed by David Batty and Francis Jupurrurla Kelly, and produced by the Warlpiri Media Association, released in 2001. A bush mechanic, in Australian parlance, is someone who uses unorthodox techniques and readily available materials to build or fix mechanical problems.Bush Mechanics definition The television show features Aboriginal (Warlpiri) people from Yuendumu, in the Northern Territory, fixing cars as they travel through Central Australia. As they traverse the desert in their dilapidated vehicles, the series follows how they solve multiple car problems with inventive, wacky and unpredictable bush repair techniques. The characters include Jack Jakamarra, an Aboriginal elder who introduces the episodes by recalling some of his first encounters with white people and their ways, and Jupurrula, the \\"magic mechanic\\" who seems to appear out of nowhere to help the Bush Mechanics when they're in real trouble. The television series was made after initial half-hour documentary, which garnered international recognition. It consisted of four subsequent episodes, first broadcast by ABC Television (Australia) from 2 October 2001 to December 2001. The episodes were: # Motorcar Ngutju (Good Motorcar) # Payback # The Chase # The Rainmakers The series is notable for being one of the first media to be in an Aboriginal Australian language, as much of the dialogue is in Warlpiri and Kriol. Episodes Episode One involved a station wagon with the band's equipment on the roof. Since the car was very old, the back half collapsed. They then removed the roof of the car with an axe, turned it upside down, and tied it to the back of the car, loaded the items from the roof onto the same roof and then used it as a trailer behind the car. They continued down the sandy track dragging the roof behind them. Reception Describe as one of the most original and popular television series produced in Australia, and \\"iconic\\", the series afterwards became a bestselling DVD.  Awards  *Australian Film Institute Open Craft Award, to Francis Jupurrula Kelly, for the original concept. Exhibition and book An exhibition based on the series was developed by the National Motor Museum (a museum of the History Trust of South Australia) and Pintubi Anmatjere Warlpiri (PAW) Media, in 2018. It was mounted at the Melbourne Museum from 9 March to 15 March 2018 before touring the country, finishing at the National Museum of Australia from 6 December 2018 to 24 February 2019. A book entitled Bush mechanics: from Yuendumu to the world, by Mandy Paul, was published in 2017 to accompany the exhibition.

In contrast to other contact-induced language changes like creolization or the formation of mixed languages, convergence refers to a mutual process that results in changes in all the languages involved. Linguists use the term to describe changes in the linguistic patterns of the languages in contact rather than alterations of isolated lexical items.  Contexts  Language convergence occurs in geographic areas with two or more unrelated languages in contact, resulting in groups of languages with similar linguistic features that were not inherited from each language's proto-language. These geographic and linguistic groups are called linguistic areas, or Sprachbund areas. Linguistic features shared by the languages in a language area as a result of language convergence are called areal features. In situations with many languages in contact and a variety of areal features, linguists may use the term language convergence to indicate the impossibility of locating a singular source for each areal feature. However, as the classification of linguistic areas and language convergence depends on shared areal features, linguists must distinguish between areal features resulting from convergence and internally motivated changes resulting in chance similarities between languages.Appel, Ren√©; Pieter Muysken (1987). ‚ÄúLanguage Contact and Language Change,‚Äù In Language Contact and Bilingualism. New York: Edward Arnold. pp. 153-163.  Mechanisms  Language convergence occurs primarily through diffusion, the spread of a feature from one language to another. The causes of language convergence are highly dependent on the specifics of the contact between the languages involved. Often, convergence is motivated by bilingual code-switching or code-alternation. Seeking full expressive capacity in both languages, bilingual speakers identify preexisting parallels between languages and use these structures to express similar meanings, eventually leading to convergence or increasing the frequency of the similar patterns. Sociolinguistic factors may also influence the effects of language convergence, as ethnic boundaries can function as barriers to language convergence. Ethnic boundaries may help to explain areas in which linguists‚Äô predictions about language convergence do not align with reality, such as areas with high inter-ethnic contact but low levels of convergence.  Results  Language convergence often results in the increased frequency of preexisting patterns in a language; if one feature is present in two languages in contact, convergence results in increased use and cross-linguistic similarity of the parallel feature. As contact situations leading to language convergence lack defined substrate and superstrate languages, the outcomes of convergence often resemble structures found in all the languages involved without perfectly replicating any one pattern. Language convergence is most apparent in phonetics, with the phonological systems of the languages in contact gradually coming to resemble one another. In some cases, the results of phonological convergence may be limited to a few phonemes, while in other linguistic areas phonological convergence can result in widespread changes that affect the entire phonological system, such as the development of phonemic tone distinctions. In contrast to the limited effects of lexical borrowing, phonetic, syntactic, or morphological convergence can have greater consequences, as converging patterns can influence an entire system rather than only a handful of lexical items.  Difficulties  When studying convergence, linguists take care to distinguish between features inherited from a language's proto-language, internally motivated changes, and diffusion from an outside source; in order to argue for language convergence, linguists try to argue for both an outside source and the mechanism that precipitated the change. The more drastic effects of language convergence, such as significant syntactic convergence and mixed languages, lead some linguists to question the validity of traditional historical linguistic methods. Because of these far-reaching effects, other linguists are hesitant to accept convergence explanations for similar features and argue that often another explanation better represents changes that might otherwise attributed to language convergence.  Examples  * Balkans Sprachbund: Contact between AD 800 and AD 1700 led to changes in phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicon of Albanian, Bulgarian, Romanian, and Greek. The Balkans Sprachbund is an extreme case of language convergence. * Arnhem Land, Australia: Morphosyntactic convergence and massive lexical diffusion in the Yuulgnu languages Ritharngnu, Dhay îyi, and others and the ‚ÄúPrefixing‚Äù languages Ngandi, Nunggubuyu, and others, though long periods of separation helped to preserve language boundaries. * Spanish and Quechua: Phonological convergence of the palatal /l/ in Spanish and Quechua. Northern variants of Ecuadorian Spanish and Quechua include the innovative /≈æ/ while southern variants of both languages maintain the /lÃÉ/ pronunciation. * Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese: Form a linguistic area based on the areal feature of phonemic tone distinctions. * Indo-European and Dravidian languages: Include the shared areal feature of retroflex consonants. * Chipewyan, Cree, French, and English: Phonological convergence of c and s-series consonants.

He apparently received the castle of his mother's family. He was married and had two known sons. He entered the order after the death of his wife, at an unknown time before 1239. He is first mentioned in 1239 as a witness, as frere Girard de Mauberge. In 1240 he signs as Marshall of the order in a treaty with the Knights Hospitaller. At this time, Pope Gregory IX was planning to incorporate the Teutonic Order into the Knights Hospitaller, and Gerhard's career in the order was likely furthered by his good connections to the Hospitaller order. He was most likely elected Grand Master in late 1241. He is recorded as holding this office in February 1242, when he represented Frederick II at the Roman curia. Frederick II dispatched the new Grand Master, the Archbishop of Bari, and the Magister Roger Porcastrello to pressure the papal conclave to elect Otto of St. Nicholas as pope, but Pope Celestine IV was chosen instead. During 1243, he seems to have been a follower of Frederick II and his son Conrad IV in their conflict with the new pope Innocent IV, sent by Frederick as an ambassador to the pope to negotiate a reconciliation in June 1243. The pope gave Gerhard an apostolic ring, representing Prussia as a papal fief of the knights in return for annual tribute from the Order.The knights fought against ≈öwiƒôtope≈Çk II of Pomerania during von Malberg's service. In late 1243 or early 1244 (before 7 July 1244), Gerhard resigned as Grand Master. The reasons for his resignation are unclear, but he seems to have been accused of poor leadership and mismanagement. Innocent IV permitted Gerhard to enter the Knights Templar, but there is no evidence that Gerhard made use of this.  References  O.

He was also involved in anti-Nazi conspiracies and played an important role in the rescue of the European Jews. Early life Gyula Cseszneky's father was an inventor and impoverished aristocrat, a member of the House of Cseszneky, while his mother was the only daughter and heir of a wealthy grain merchant with extended commercial links throughout Austria-Hungary and the Balkans. After World War I, most of their properties were confiscated by the Serbian government, and then his father's sudden death even worsened their hardships. Their financial difficulties notwithstanding, Gyula excelled at school, and showed a great interest in literature and poetry. His family encouraged him to become a Roman Catholic priest, however, he shortly changed his mind and as a holder of the Boncompagni family's grant he went to Italy to a military school. In Italy he was introduced to the cultural √©lite and high society by an old family friend and senator of the Kingdom of Italy, Count Enrico San Martino di Valperga. Fascinated by the Italian language and culture, the young Hungarian cadet translated into his native language several poems of Gabriele D'Annunzio. Cseszneky admired the Italian poet, and probably his subsequent adventure in the Balkans was inspired by D'Annunzio's Regency of Carnaro in Fiume.Szil√°gyi Alad√°r: Operett√°llam World War II =Reannexation of Northern Transylvania= In 1940 after the Second Vienna Arbitration as a Hungarian reserve officer, he took part in the reannexation of Northern Transylvania.

Gyula Cseszneky who spoke fluent Croatian, Italian, German and Hungarian, and had also met Prince Aimone during his years in Rome, was appointed aide-de-camp and privy counsellor to the new monarch.

Life Born Kurt Gerson into a well-off merchant family in Berlin, he studied medicine before being called up for military service in World War I. After being seriously wounded he was qualified as a military doctor in the German Army (despite having been only in his second year at university). After the war Gerron turned to a stage career, becoming a theatre actor under director Max Reinhardt in 1920. He appeared in secondary roles in several silent films and began directing film shorts in 1926. Gerron's popular cinema breakthrough came with The Blue Angel (Der Blaue Engel, 1930) opposite Marlene Dietrich. Two years before, Gerron originated the role of \\"Tiger\\" Brown in the 1928 premiere production of The Threepenny Opera (Die Dreigroschenoper) at the Berlin Theater am Schiffbauerdamm, in which he also performed \\"Mack the Knife\\", the first public performance of the song. With the show's international success, Gerron's name and recorded voice became well known across Europe. Under the Nazis After the 1933 seizure of power by the Nazis (known today as the Machtergreifung), Gerron left Nazi Germany with his wife and parents, traveling first to Paris and later to Amsterdam. He continued work there as an actor at the Stadsschouwburg and directed several movies. Several times he was offered employment in Hollywood through the agency of Peter Lorre and Josef von Sternberg, but refused to leave Europe. After the Wehrmacht occupied the Netherlands, Gerron was first interned in the transit camp at Westerbork before being sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. There he was forced by the SS to stage the cabaret review, Karussell, in which he reprised Mack the Knife, as well as compositions by Martin Roman and other imprisoned musicians and artists. In 1944, Gerron was coerced into directing a Nazi propaganda film intended to be viewed in \\"neutral\\" nations (in Switzerland, Sweden, and Ireland, for example) showing how \\"humane\\" conditions were at Theresienstadt. Once filming was finished, Gerron and members of the Jazz pianist Martin Roman's Ghetto Swingers were deported on the camp's final train transport to Auschwitz. Gerron and his wife were gassed immediately upon arrival on 28 October 1944, along with the film's entire performing entourage (except for Roman and guitarist Coco Schumann). The next day, Reichsf√ºhrer SS Heinrich Himmler ordered the closure of the gas chambers. All known complete prints of Gerron's final film, which was to have been called Theresienstadt. Ein Dokumentarfilm aus dem j√ºdischen Siedlungsgebiet (Terezin: A Documentary Film of the Jewish Resettlement), and which is also referred to as Der F√ºhrer schenkt den Juden eine Stadt (The F√ºhrer Gives the Jews a City), were destroyed in 1945.

During the 1970s and 80s, Brazil and Argentina embarked on a nuclear competition. Through technology transfers from the West German company, Kraftwerk Union (a subsidiary of Siemens), which did not require IAEA safeguards, Brazil pursued a covert nuclear weapons program known as the \\"Parallel Program\\", with enrichment facilities (including small scale centrifuge enrichment plants, a limited reprocessing capability, and a missile program). Brazil also reportedly bought highly enriched uranium from China in the 1980s. In December 1982, then-president of the National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN), Rex Nazar√©, headed a mission to China with the objective of purchasing enriched uranium from his Chinese counterparts at the China National Nuclear Corporation.Brasil-RPC.

They returned to Brazil in a container that, supposedly, carried porcelain purchased by the First Lady Dulce Figueiredo during the presidential trip.Oral history interviews, CPDOC/FGV Retrieved 1 July 2013.BARLETTA, Michael (1997). \\"The Military Nuclear Program in Brazil\\", Center for International Security and Arms Control Working Paper, Stanford University, p.13. In 1987, President Sarney announced that Brazil had enriched uranium to 20%. In 1990, President Fernando Collor de Mello symbolically closed the Cachimbo test site, in Par√°, and exposed the military‚Äôs secret plan to develop a nuclear weapon. Brazil's National Congress opened an investigation into the Parallel Program. Congress members visited numerous facilities, including the Institute of Advanced Studies (IEAv) in S√£o Jos√© dos Campos. They also interviewed key players in the nuclear program, such as former President Jo√£o Figueiredo and retired Army General Danilo Venturini, the former head of the National Security Council under Figueiredo. The congressional investigation exposed secret bank accounts, code-named \\"Delta\\", which were managed by the CNEN and used for funding the program. The congressional report revealed that the IEAv had designed two atomic bomb devices, one with a yield of twenty to thirty kilotons and a second with a yield of twelve kilotons. The same report revealed that Brazil's military regime secretly exported eight tons of uranium to Iraq in 1981.Congressional Report on the \\"Parallel Program\\". Senate of Brazil. Retrieved on 2012-03-23. . In 1991, Brazil and Argentina renounced their nuclear rivalry. On 13 December 1991, they signed the Quadripartite agreement, at the IAEA headquarters, creating the Brazilian‚ÄìArgentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials and allowing fullscope IAEA safeguards of Argentine and Brazilian nuclear installations. Brazil officially opened the Resende enrichment plant in May 2006.BBC News: Brazil joins world's nuclear club BBC News. Retrieved on 2010-10-06. Brazil's enrichment technology development, and the plant itself, involved substantial discussions with the IAEA and its constituent nations. The dispute came down to whether IAEA inspectors would be allowed to inspect the machines themselves. The Brazilian government did not allow the inspection of the centrifugal cascade halls, arguing that this would reveal technological secrets (probably relating to the use of a magnetic lower bearing in place of the more common mechanical bearing). The Brazilian authorities stated that, as Brazil is not part of any \\"axis of evil\\", the pressure for full access to inspection - even in universities - could be construed as an attempt to pirate industrial secrets.Ur√¢nio: Brasil n√£o √© contra a inspe√ß√£o internacional, mas contra aumento da inspe√ß√£o que pode apropriar-se da tecnologia desenvolvida pelo pa√≠s Jornal da Ci√™ncia. Retrieved on 2010-10-06. . They also claimed that their technology is better than that of the United States and France, mainly because the centrifugal axis is not mechanical, but electromagnetic. Eventually, after extensive negotiations, agreement was reached that while not directly inspecting the centrifuges, the IAEA would inspect the composition of the gas entering and leaving the centrifuge. Then‚ÄìU.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell stated in 2004 that he was sure that Brazil had no plans to develop nuclear weapons.\\"US sure of Brazil nuclear plans\\". BBC News.

Works *His service in World War I gave him a lifelong hatred of the military, expressed in his first major painting Remembrance (1931). The painting depicts a pair of wraith-like soldiers clutching white rabbits, an airborne female contortionist throwing a handful of medals, and the whole scene being blessed by a cross-dressing cardinal. This contempt for the Church as a corrupt institution provided Trouille with the inspiration for decades of work: *Dialogue at the Carmel (1944) shows a skull wearing a crown of thorns being used as an ornament. *The Mummy shows a mummified woman coming to life as a result of a shaft of light falling on a large bust of Andr√© Breton. *The Magician (1944) has a self- portrait satisfying a group of swooning women with a wave of his magician's wand. *My Tomb (1947) shows Trouille's tomb as a focal point of corruption and depravity in a graveyard. *Trouille's other common subjects were sex, as shown in Lust (1959), a portrait of the Marquis de Sade sitting in the foreground of a landscape decorated with a tableau of various perversions, and a \\"madly egoistic bravado\\" employed in a self-mocking style. *His 1946 portrait of a reclining nude shown from behind entitled Oh! Calcutta, Calcutta! - a pun in French - was chosen as the title for the 1969 musical revue Oh! Calcutta!. (The French phrase \\"oh quel cul t'as\\" translates roughly as \\"oh what a lovely ass you have\\".) Style After his work was seen by Louis Aragon and Salvador Dal√≠, Trouille was declared a Surrealist by Andr√© Breton - a label Trouille accepted only as a way of gaining exposure, not having any real sympathy with that movement. The simple style and lurid colouring of Trouille's paintings echo the lithographic posters used in advertising in the first half of the 20th century.

Muƒüla is the center of the District of Mente≈üe and Muƒüla Province , which stretches along Turkey's Aegean coast. Muƒüla's center is situated inland at an altitude of 660 m and lies at a distance of about from the nearest seacoast in the Gulf of G√∂kova to its south-west. Muƒüla (Mente≈üe) district area neighbors the district areas of Milas, Yataƒüan and Kavaklƒ±dere to its north by north-west and those of Ula and K√∂yceƒüiz, all of whom are dependent districts. Muƒüla is the administrative capital of a province that incorporates internationally well-known and popular tourist resorts such as Bodrum, Marmaris, Dat√ßa, Dalyan, Fethiye, √ñl√ºdeniz and also the smaller resort of Sarigerme. The district area's physical features are determined by several pot-shaped high plains abbreviated by mountains, of which the largest is the one where the city of Muƒüla is located and which is called under the same name (Muƒüla Plain). It is surrounded by slopes denuded of soil, paved with calcerous formations and a scrub cover which gives the immediate vicinity of Muƒüla a barren look uncharacteristic for its region. Arable land is restricted to valley bottoms. A relatively small city of 74,371 (2019 census) and often overlooked by visitors to nearby coastal resorts, Muƒüla received a new boost with the foundation of Muƒüla University in the 1990s. Today, the university brings together a student community of several thousands and, added by its academia and staff, it played a key role in bringing movement to the city and in opening it to the outside world. Its former profile as a predominantly rural, difficult to access, isolated and underpopulated region enclosed by a rugged mountainous complex is now coming to an end. Also in recent years, a major program of restoration of the city's architectural heritage has enhanced local tourism. The city remains an orderly, compact and leafy provincial center, which kept its old neighborhoods without surrendering to a boom in concrete constructions, but displays a progressive mind as exemplified by the pride still expressed at having had Turkey's first female provincial governor in the 1990s, Ms. Lale Aytaman. Nevertheless, Muƒüla still lacks sizeable manufacturing and processing centers and relies on trade, crafts, services, tourism and agriculture in its economy. Therefore, tourism in Muƒüla is a great employment opportunity for the local community and fertile soils and suitable climate conditions also give an opportunity to harvest variety of products for people who deals with the agricultural sector. History =Classical antiquity= In ancient times, Muƒüla was apparently a rather insignificant settlement halfway on the passage between the Carian cities of Idrias (later Stratonicea) to the north and Idyma (modern Akyaka) to the southwest on the coast. The indigenous name Mobolla, over time corrupted into \\"Mogolla\\" and then further into the modern \\"Muƒüla\\", appears for the first time in the beginning of the 2nd century BC at the time of its region's passage from what was apparently an eastern Carian federation linked with Taba (modern Tavas) and other cities to Rhodian domination. Mobolla was part of the Rhodian Peraea on a firm basis as of 167 BC until at least the 2nd century AD. The Rhodian territory started here and while region was subject to Rhodes, it was not incorporated in the Rhodian state. There are almost no ruins to reveal the history of the settlement of Mobolla. On the high hill to the north of the city, a few ancient remains indicate that it was the site of an acropolis. A handful of inscriptions were unearthed within the city itself and they date back to the 2nd century BCE. In 2018, archaeologists unearthed a 2,300-year-old rock sepulchre of an ancient Greek boxer called Diagoras of Rhodes on a hill in the Turgut village, Muƒüla province, Marmaris. This unusual pyramid tomb was considered to belong to a holy person by the local people. The shrine, used as a pilgrimage by locals until the 1970s, also has the potential to be the only pyramid grave in Turkey. Excavation team also discovered an inscription with these words: ‚ÄúI will be vigilant at the very top so as to ensure that no coward can come and destroy this grave. In 2018, archaeological ruins and mosaics discovered in the city have been confirmed to belong to the villa of the Greek fisherman Phainos who lived in the 2nd century AD. Phainos was the richest and the most famous fisherman of his time.Villa and mosaics of Greek fisherman Phainos discovered in Turkey =Turkish conquest= Turkish-era Muƒüla also remained a minor site in the beginning despite having been captured relatively early for western Anatolia in the course of the 13th century. The local ruling dynasty of Mente≈üe had their capital in Milas. =Ottoman and Republican periods= Muƒüla acquired regional importance after it replaced Milas as the seat of the subprovince (sanjak) under the Ottoman Empire in 1420. The sanjak kept the name Mente≈üe until the Republican Era, when it was renamed Muƒüla after its seat of government. Climate Muƒüla has a Mediterranean Climate. It is characterised by long, hot and dry summers with cool and wet winters.  Places of interest  Although it is close to major resorts, Muƒüla has only recently begun to attract visitors. Sights of interest in the city include: * Great Mosque of Muƒüla (Ulu Cami) ‚Äì large mosque built in 1344 by the Beys of Mente≈üe * Konakaltƒ± Han and Yaƒücƒ±lar Han ‚Äì restored 18th century caravanserais, the first used as an art gallery and facing Muƒüla Museum, and the second used for more commercial purposes * Kur≈üunlu Cami ‚Äì large mosque built in 1495 * Muƒüla City Museum has a good collection of archaeological and ethnographical artefacts, as well as 9 million years old animal and plant fossiles recently discovered in Kaklƒ±catepe nearby * the Ottoman Empire-era bazaar (Arasta) ‚Äì marked by a clock tower built by a Greek craftsman named Filivari Usta in 1895 * Vakƒ±flar Hamam ‚Äì a still operating Turkish bath which dates back to 1258 The old quarter of Muƒüla ‚Äì on the slopes and around Saburhane Square (Meydanƒ±), consisting of about four hundred registered old houses dating from the 18th and 19th centuries, many of which are restored. These houses are mainly in the Turkish/Ottoman style, characterized by hayat (\\"courtyard\\") sections accessed through double-shuttered doors called kuzulu kapƒ± (\\"lamb doors\\") and dotted with chimneys typical of Muƒüla. But there are also a number of \\"Greek\\" houses. The differences between the two types of houses may have as much to do with the extent to which wood or stone were used in their architecture, and whether they were arranged in introverted or extraverted styles, as with who inhabited them previously. Local students tend to hang out in open air caf√©s along the ƒ∞zmir highway or in the caravanserai or in Sanat Evi (\\"Art House\\"), an Ottoman style residence that has been turned into a caf√©/art gallery exhibiting principally wood carvings.

Early life Bill Gammell was born in Edinburgh, and was the son of an investment banker, who was invited at an early age to join Edinburgh's Ivory & Sime (which was started in the late 1800s with the formation of the British Assets Trust.) Gammell attended Edinburgh's exclusive Fettes College where he was friends and debating partners with future British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The two have remained close friends. After Fettes, Gammell attended the University of Stirling where he obtained a BA in Economics and Accountancy. Rugby Gammell played rugby union at county level and for the Scottish national team. A tall winger, he earned five international caps, and played in the game against Japan in 1977 in Tokyo when he scored four tries in the Scots' 74-9 victory. Gammell scored two tries on his debut for Scotland, against Ireland at Murrayfield in 1977. Business career After his rugby career was ended by injury, Gammell followed his father into business. Using venture capital, he founded Cairn Energy in Edinburgh. The company invested in several unsuccessful oilfields in the US before making a modest strike in the Pennsylvania oilfield. Gammell was appointed Cairn's Chief Executive on its initial listing in 1989. In the mid 1990s, he led the company in a radical reallocation of its assets, moving out of US and North Sea oil and gas concerns and into neglected fields in South Asia. The company's fortunes soared in 2004, when a field it had bought in 2001 (for $7.5 million) from Shell in the Indian province of Rajasthan was found to contain close to 1.1 billion barrels of oil, catapulting it into the FTSE 100. Gammell was paid an annual salary of ¬£552,000 for his role as chief executive at Cairn Energy. On 1 July 2011 Gammell assumed the role of non-executive chairman. Gammell's father invested in US oil company Bush-Overbey, owned by future US President George H. W. Bush. The two families became friends, with George W. Bush spending the summer at the Gammell's farm in Scotland. George W. attended Bill Gammell's wedding in Glasgow in 1983. The two have remained close friends. When George W. Bush assumed the Presidency, both he and Blair reportedly called their mutual friend Gammell to ask his opinion of the other. Bill Gammell a director of the Scottish Institute of Sport and Artemis AiM VCT plc., and in 2004 he was awarded UK Entrepreneur of the Year.

It is studied in several subfields of linguistics: historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, and evolutionary linguistics. Some commentators use the label corruption to suggest that language change constitutes a degradation in the quality of a language, especially when the change originates from human error or is a prescriptively discouraged usage. Modern linguistics typically does not support this concept, since from a scientific point of view such innovations cannot be judged in terms of good or bad. John Lyons notes that \\"any standard of evaluation applied to language-change must be based upon a recognition of the various functions a language 'is called upon' to fulfil in the society which uses it\\". Causes * Economy: Speech communities tend to change their utterances to be as efficient and effective (with as little effort) as possible, while still reaching communicative goals. Purposeful speaking therefore involves a trade-off of costs and benefits. ** The principle of least effort tends to result in phonetic reduction of speech forms. See vowel reduction, cluster reduction, lenition, and elision. After some time a change may become widely accepted (it becomes a regular sound change) and may end up treated as standard. For instance: going to ‚Üí gonna or , with examples of both vowel reduction and elision , . * Expressiveness: Common or overused language tends to lose its emotional or rhetorical intensity over time; therefore, new words and constructions are continuously employed to revive that intensity * Analogy: Over time, speech communities unconsciously apply patterns of rules in certain words, sounds, etc. to unrelated other words, sounds, etc. * Language contact: Words and constructions are borrowed from one language into another. * Geographic separation: When people with one language move away from each other, the language will gradually diverge into separate dialects, due to different experiences.The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language (1997, p. 335) * Cultural environment: As a culture evolves, new places, situations, and objects inevitably enter its language, whether or not the culture encounters different people. * Migration/Movement: Speech communities, moving into a region with a new or more complex linguistic situation, will influence, and be influenced by, language change; they sometimes even end up with entirely new languages, such as pidgins and creoles. * Imperfect learning: According to one view, children regularly learn the adult forms imperfectly, and the changed forms then turn into a new standard. Alternatively, imperfect learning occurs regularly in one part of society, such as an immigrant group, where the minority language forms a substratum, and the changed forms can ultimately influence majority usage. * Social prestige: Language may not only change towards features that have more social prestige, but also away from ones with negative prestige, as in the case of the loss of rhoticity in the British Received Pronunciation accent. Such movements can go back and forth. According to Guy Deutscher, the tricky question is \\"Why are changes not brought up short and stopped in their tracks? At first sight, there seem to be all the reasons in the world why society should never let the changes through.\\" He sees the reason for tolerating change in the fact that we already are used to \\"synchronic variation\\", to the extent that we are hardly aware of it. For example, when we hear the word \\"wicked\\", we automatically interpret it as either \\"evil\\" or \\"wonderful\\", depending on whether it is uttered by an elderly lady or a teenager. Deutscher speculates that \\"[i]n a hundred years' time, when the original meaning of 'wicked' has all but been forgotten, people may wonder how it was ever possible for a word meaning 'evil' to change its sense to 'wonderful' so quickly.\\"The Unfolding of Language, 2005, chapter 2, esp. pp. 63, 69 and 71 Types All languages change continually, and do so in many and varied ways. Marcel Cohen details various types of language change under the overall headings of the external evolution and internal evolution of languages. =Lexical changes= The study of lexical changes forms the diachronic portion of the science of onomasiology. The ongoing influx of new words into the English language (for example) helps make it a rich field for investigation into language change, despite the difficulty of defining precisely and accurately the vocabulary available to speakers of English. Throughout its history English has not only borrowed words from other languages but has re-combined and recycled them to create new meanings, whilst losing some old words. Dictionary-writers try to keep track of the changes in languages by recording (and, ideally, dating) the appearance in a language of new words, or of new usages for existing words. By the same token, they may tag some words eventually as \\"archaic\\" or \\"obsolete\\". =Phonetic and phonological changes= The concept of sound change covers both phonetic and phonological developments. The sociolinguist William Labov recorded the change in pronunciation in a relatively short period in the American resort of Martha's Vineyard and showed how this resulted from social tensions and processes. Even in the relatively short time that broadcast media have recorded their work, one can observe the difference between the pronunciation of the newsreaders of the 1940s and the 1950s and the pronunciation of today. The greater acceptance and fashionability of regional accents in media may also reflect a more democratic, less formal society ‚Äî compare the widespread adoption of language policies. The mapping and recording of small-scale phonological changes poses difficulties, especially as the practical technology of sound recording dates only from the 19th century. Written texts provide the main (indirect) evidence of how language sounds have changed over the centuries. But note Ferdinand de Saussure's work on postulating the existence and disappearance of laryngeals in Proto-Indo-European as an example of other methods of detecting/reconstructing sound-changes within historical linguistics. Poetic devices such as rhyme and rhythm may provide clues to previous phonological habits. =Spelling changes= Standardisation of spelling originated centuries ago. Differences in spelling often catch the eye of a reader of a text from a previous century. The pre-print era had fewer literate people: languages lacked fixed systems of orthography, and the handwritten manuscripts that survive often show words spelled according to regional pronunciation and to personal preference. =Semantic changes= Semantic changes are shifts in the meanings of existing words. Basic types of semantic change include: * pejoration, in which a term's connotations become more negative * amelioration, in which a term's connotations become more positive * broadening, in which a term acquires additional potential uses * narrowing, in which a term's potential uses are restricted After a word enters a language, its meaning can change as through a shift in the valence of its connotations. As an example, when \\"villain\\" entered English it meant 'peasant' or 'farmhand', but acquired the connotation 'low-born' or 'scoundrel', and today only the negative use survives. Thus 'villain' has undergone pejoration. Conversely, the word \\"wicked\\" is undergoing amelioration in colloquial contexts, shifting from its original sense of 'evil', to the much more positive one of 'brilliant'. Words' meanings may also change in terms of the breadth of their semantic domain. Narrowing a word limits its alternative meanings, whereas broadening associates new meanings with it. For example, \\"hound\\" (Old English hund) once referred to any dog, whereas in modern English it denotes only a particular type of dog. On the other hand, the word \\"dog\\" itself has been broadened from its Old English root 'dogge', the name of a particular breed, to become the general term for all domestic canines. =Syntactic change= Syntactic change is the evolution of the syntactic structure of a natural language. Over time, syntactic change is the greatest modifier of a particular language. Massive changes ‚Äì attributable either to creolization or to relexification ‚Äì may occur both in syntax and in vocabulary. Syntactic change can also be purely language-internal, whether independent within the syntactic component or the eventual result of phonological or morphological change. Sociolinguistics The sociolinguist Jennifer Coates, following William Labov, describes linguistic change as occurring in the context of linguistic heterogeneity. She explains that \\"[l]inguistic change can be said to have taken place when a new linguistic form, used by some sub-group within a speech community, is adopted by other members of that community and accepted as the norm.\\"Coates, 1992: 169 Can and Patton (2010) provide a quantitative analysis of twentieth century Turkish literature using forty novels of forty authors. Using weighted least squares regression and a sliding window approach, they show that, as time passes, words, in terms of both tokens (in text) and types (in vocabulary), have become longer. They indicate that the increase in word lengths with time can be attributed to the government-initiated language \\"reform\\" of the 20th century. This reform aimed at replacing foreign words used in Turkish, especially Arabic- and Persian-based words (since they were in majority when the reform was initiated in early 1930s), with newly coined pure Turkish neologisms created by adding suffixes to Turkish word stems (Lewis, 1999). Can and Patton (2010), based on their observations of the change of a specific word use (more specifically in newer works the preference of ama over fakat, both borrowed from Arabic and meaning 'but', and their inverse usage correlation is statistically significant), also speculate that the word length increase can influence the common word choice preferences of authors. Kadochnikov (2016) analyzes the political and economic logic behind the development of the Russian language. Ever since the emergence of the unified Russian state in the 15th and 16th centuries the government played a key role in standardizing the Russian language and developing its prescriptive norms with the fundamental goal of ensuring that it can be efficiently used as a practical tool in all sorts of legal, judicial, adimistrative and economic affairs throughout the country. Quantification Altintas, Can, and Patton (2007) introduce a systematic approach to language change quantification by studying unconsciously-used language features in time-separated parallel translations. For this purpose, they use objective style markers such as vocabulary richness and lengths of words, word stems and suffixes, and employ statistical methods to measure their changes over time. Language shift and social status Languages perceived to be \\"higher status\\" stabilise or spread at the expense of other languages perceived by their own speakers to be \\"lower-status\\". Historical examples are the early Welsh and Lutheran Bible translations, leading to the liturgical languages Welsh and High German thriving today, unlike other Celtic or German variants. For prehistory, Forster and Renfrew (2011) argue that in some cases there is a correlation of language change with intrusive male Y chromosomes but not with female mtDNA. They then speculate that technological innovation (transition from hunting- gathering to agriculture, or from stone to metal tools) or military prowess (as in the abduction of British women by Vikings to Iceland) causes immigration of at least some males, and perceived status change. Then, in mixed-language marriages with these males, prehistoric women would often have chosen to transmit the \\"higher-status\\" spouse's language to their children, yielding the language/Y-chromosome correlation seen today.

It originally aired on December 6, 1963 on CBS. In this episode, a group of soldiers travel back in time to take part in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Opening narration Plot The show's teaser on June 25, 1876 has an army scout; a Sgt and a trooper finding evidence of Indians; an arrow strikes the Scout in the back while the Sgt and Cpl fire their carbines at the unseen foe. The time jumps ahead to the present-June 25, 1964, the 88th anniversary of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, three United States Army National Guard soldiers (MSgt. William Connors, Pvt. Michael McCluskey, Cpl. Richard Langsford) are in a M3 Stuart tank participating in a war game being conducted near the site of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, where Major General (at the time, Lt. Colonel) George Armstrong Custer made his last stand. Their orders coincide with the route of Custer and his men. As they follow the route, they hear strange things such as Indian battle cries and horses running. As nobody is there, the men examine the possibilities. Connors wonders if they've somehow gone back in time. When they return, Connors reports to his Captain Dennet what occurred and is reprimanded. The following day the trio go out and again experience strange phenomena. The captain contacts them via radio and orders them to return to base when Connors tries to explain what is happening. Connors breaks contact and the captain sends his lieutenant and two men to bring them in. However, the tank crew abandon their tank and continue on foot with their sidearms and rifles. They find a group of teepees and McCluskey goes to investigate. He soon returns with an arrow protruding from his back. The three men climb a ridge where they see a battle taking place below. They join it and are never seen again. Later, Captain Dennet enters the Custer Battlefield National Monument. Lieutenant Woodard, the officer who presides over the reconnaissance mission to find the tank and the three soldiers, reports that all they found was the abandoned tank. Later, both the captain and the lieutenant notice the names of their missing soldiers on the monument with the names of Custer's men. Captain Dennet states that it was a pity the missing soldiers couldn't have taken the tank with them to the battle. Closing narration Cast * Ron Foster as Sgt. William Connors * Randy Boone as Pvt.

The village is located on the islands of Holmen, Odden, Lyng√∏ya and Steins√∏ya. The Lyng√∏r Lighthouse lies at the northeast edge of the village area. History Previously, the village was a popular home for sea captains since it is only accessible by boat and it has no cars. The village is well-known for its scenic harbour and wooden houses. It is recognized as one of the best-preserved communities in Europe. Most of the buildings are now summer homes, but there are still about 75 permanent, year-round residents (in 2017). A popular destination in the summer months, it has more recently struggled to maintain a stable permanent population since it has no road connections to the mainland. The community has a sail-making factory, a few restaurants that are open during the tourist season, and a general store. The strait that goes through Lyng√∏r is also well known for the dramatic Battle of Lyng√∏r during the Napoleonic Wars, in which the British Royal Navy effectively put an end to the last of Dano-Norwegian naval forces.

Services on the Sudbury Branch Line are operated by Abellio Greater Anglia. The museum has a wide collection of locomotives and rolling stock, some of which are fully restored, three are converted into Thomas, Percy and Toby replicas while others are undergoing repair and restoration. The Restoration Shed was built in 1983‚Äì4, before which most work had to take place in the Goods Shed or in the open. On event days, steam or diesel train rides are operated over a short demonstration track. The museum also plays host to two popular annual events: the Winter Beer Festival held in late February / early March (Timing depends on UK School Holidays), and the Summer Beer Festival held each September. During the festivals, additional late-evening trains on the Sudbury Branch Line allow festival-goers to return home by train subject to provision by the train operation companies. There are no moving exhibits during the festivals, although train carriages are usually open to sit in and drink, with one wagon doubling up as The Shunters Arms at the summer festival. In addition many other event days happen during the year, such as Classic Car rallies, Forties and Fifties day events, SteamPunk fairs, Model Railway events, Plays and musical performances and the ever popular \\"Days out with Thomas\\" events featuring Thomas The Tank Engine. Museum history =Formation of the society= The museum was originally formed as the Stour Valley Railway Preservation Society on 24 September 1968. The SVRPS was established at Chappel & Wakes Colne Station in December 1969 after a lease was obtained from British Rail to use the vacant goods yard and railway buildings, including the station building. The first public steam day took place three months later. The goods shed and station buildings were quickly restored; with a workshop being set up in the goods shed to enable maintenance and restoration work to be undertaken on the rolling stock. =The birth of the museum= The Stour Valley Railway Preservation Society was renamed to The East Anglian Railway Museum in 1986 to confirm its focus on representing railway history of the Eastern Counties rather than just operating trains.

The first targeting pods were developed in conjunction with the earliest generation of PGMs in the mid-1960s. Categories =Laser designators= The design of laser-guided bombs requires a \\"laser spot tracker\\" that locates reflected pulsed laser light from a designated target. This enables an aircraft's targeting system to home in on that specific target. The simplest spot trackers (like the Pave Penny pod) have no laser at all, just a laser sensor. Some targeting systems incorporate a laser rangefinder, a laser beam that can calculate the precise range to a target and communicate that information to the nav/attack system. Many targeting pods or installations use the same sensor as the laser spot tracker to receive the reflected rangefinder signal, so they can perform both ranging and tracking. These are called laser ranger and marked target seeker (LRMTS). Some targeting systems have a laser that can designate a target for laser-guided munitions, enabling the aircraft to designate its own targets or designate for other friendly units. LRMTS installations (particularly fixed internal units) of the 1970s often did not have a laser of sufficient power and slant range to designate targets, although they could provide rangefinding. Such units required targets to be designated by a ground designator or forward air controller in another aircraft. =Electro-optics= F-15E Heads-up display of infrared image from LANTIRN. The basic electro-optical (EO) sensor is essentially a closed-circuit television camera, usually with a magnification lens, helping the aircrew to locate and identify targets. For night and adverse weather use, many EO sensors incorporate low-light light-amplification systems. Some pods supplement the basic visual EO with forward-looking infra-red (FLIR) to aid in locating and identifying targets in darkness. Such systems are sometimes called infrared search and track sensors. =Radar= Some pods may contain a small radar set for targeting and navigation, particularly for aircraft that have no search radar. Such a system, for example, was developed for the unsuccessful N/AW (Night/Adverse Weather) version of the USAF A-10 Thunderbolt II. Currently, laser and infrared systems are more popular than radar because they are less easily detected by adversaries, providing less warning to the target. Lasers can also provide more accurate ranging data for aerial gunnery.

SDEs are used to model various phenomena such as unstable stock prices or physical systems subject to thermal fluctuations. Typically, SDEs contain a variable which represents random white noise calculated as the derivative of Brownian motion or the Wiener process. However, other types of random behaviour are possible, such as jump processes. Random differential equations are conjugate to stochastic differential equations. Background Early work on SDEs was done to describe Brownian motion in Albert Einstein's famous paper, and at the same time by Smoluchowski. However, one of the earlier works related to Brownian motion is credited to Bachelier (1900) in his thesis 'Theory of Speculation'. This work was followed upon by Langevin. Later It√¥ and Stratonovich put SDEs on more solid mathematical footing. =Terminology= The most common form of SDEs in the literature is an ordinary differential equation with the right hand side perturbed by a term dependent on a white noise variable. In most cases, SDEs are understood as continuous time limit of the corresponding stochastic difference equations. This understanding of SDEs is ambiguous and must be complemented by an \\"interpretation\\". The most famous interpretations are provided by It√¥ and Stratonovich calculi, with the former being most frequently used in mathematics and quantitative finance. An alternative view on SDEs is the stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms. This understanding is unambiguous and corresponds to the Stratonovich version of the continuous time limit of stochastic difference equations. Associated with SDEs is the Smoluchowski equation or the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation, an equation describing the time evolution of probability distribution functions. The generalization of the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck evolution to temporal evolution of differential forms is provided by the concept of stochastic evolution operator. In physical science, there is an ambiguity in the usage of the term \\"Langevin SDEs\\". While Langevin SDEs can be of a more general form, this term typically refers to a narrow class of SDEs with gradient flow vector fields. This class of SDEs is particularly popular because it is a starting point of the Parisi‚ÄìSourlas stochastic quantization procedure, leading to a N=2 supersymmetric model closely related to supersymmetric quantum mechanics. From the physical point of view, however, this class of SDEs is not very interesting because it never exhibits spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry, i.e., (overdamped) Langevin SDEs are never chaotic. =Stochastic calculus= Brownian motion or the Wiener process was discovered to be exceptionally complex mathematically. The Wiener process is almost surely nowhere differentiable; thus, it requires its own rules of calculus. There are two dominating versions of stochastic calculus, the It√¥ stochastic calculus and the Stratonovich stochastic calculus. Each of the two has advantages and disadvantages, and newcomers are often confused whether the one is more appropriate than the other in a given situation. Guidelines exist (e.g. √òksendal, 2003) and conveniently, one can readily convert an It√¥ SDE to an equivalent Stratonovich SDE and back again. Still, one must be careful which calculus to use when the SDE is initially written down. =Numerical solutions= Numerical solution of stochastic differential equations and especially stochastic partial differential equations is a young field relatively speaking. Almost all algorithms that are used for the solution of ordinary differential equations will work very poorly for SDEs, having very poor numerical convergence. A textbook describing many different algorithms is Kloeden & Platen (1995). Methods include the Euler‚ÄìMaruyama method, Milstein method and Runge‚ÄìKutta method (SDE). Use in physics In physics, SDEs have widest applicability ranging from molecular dynamics to neurodynamics and to the dynamics of astrophysical objects. More specifically, SDEs describe all dynamical systems, in which quantum effects are either unimportant or can be taken into account as perturbations. SDEs can be viewed as a generalization of the dynamical systems theory to models with noise. This is an important generalization because real systems cannot be completely isolated from their environments and for this reason always experience external stochastic influence. There are standard techniques for transforming higher-order equations into several coupled first-order equations by introducing new unknowns. Therefore, the following is the most general class of SDEs: :\\\\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = F(x(t)) + \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=1}^ng_\\\\alpha(x(t))\\\\xi^\\\\alpha(t),\\\\, where x\\\\in X is the position in the system in its phase (or state) space, X, assumed to be a differentiable manifold, the F\\\\in TX is a flow vector field representing deterministic law of evolution, and g_\\\\alpha\\\\in TX is a set of vector fields that define the coupling of the system to Gaussian white noise, \\\\xi^\\\\alpha. If X is a linear space and g are constants, the system is said to be subject to additive noise, otherwise it is said to be subject to multiplicative noise. This term is somewhat misleading as it has come to mean the general case even though it appears to imply the limited case in which g(x) \\\\propto x. For a fixed configuration of noise, SDE has a unique solution differentiable with respect to the initial condition. Nontriviality of stochastic case shows up when one tries to average various objects of interest over noise configurations. In this sense, an SDE is not a uniquely defined entity when noise is multiplicative and when the SDE is understood as a continuous time limit of a stochastic difference equation. In this case, SDE must be complemented by what is known as \\"interpretations of SDE\\" such as It√¥ or a Stratonovich interpretations of SDEs. Nevertheless, when SDE is viewed as a continuous-time stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms, it is a uniquely defined mathematical object that corresponds to Stratonovich approach to a continuous time limit of a stochastic difference equation. In physics, the main method of solution is to find the probability distribution function as a function of time using the equivalent Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation (FPE). The Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation is a deterministic partial differential equation. It tells how the probability distribution function evolves in time similarly to how the Schr√∂dinger equation gives the time evolution of the quantum wave function or the diffusion equation gives the time evolution of chemical concentration. Alternatively, numerical solutions can be obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. Other techniques include the path integration that draws on the analogy between statistical physics and quantum mechanics (for example, the Fokker- Planck equation can be transformed into the Schr√∂dinger equation by rescaling a few variables) or by writing down ordinary differential equations for the statistical moments of the probability distribution function. Use in probability and mathematical finance The notation used in probability theory (and in many applications of probability theory, for instance mathematical finance) is slightly different. It is also the notation used in publications on numerical methods for solving stochastic differential equations. This notation makes the exotic nature of the random function of time \\\\eta_m in the physics formulation more explicit. In strict mathematical terms, \\\\eta_m cannot be chosen as an ordinary function, but only as a generalized function. The mathematical formulation treats this complication with less ambiguity than the physics formulation. A typical equation is of the form : \\\\mathrm{d} X_t = \\\\mu(X_t,t)\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} t + \\\\sigma(X_t,t)\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} B_t , where B denotes a Wiener process (Standard Brownian motion). This equation should be interpreted as an informal way of expressing the corresponding integral equation : X_{t+s} - X_{t} = \\\\int_t^{t+s} \\\\mu(X_u,u) \\\\mathrm{d} u + \\\\int_t^{t+s} \\\\sigma(X_u,u)\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} B_u . The equation above characterizes the behavior of the continuous time stochastic process Xt as the sum of an ordinary Lebesgue integral and an It√¥ integral. A heuristic (but very helpful) interpretation of the stochastic differential equation is that in a small time interval of length Œ¥ the stochastic process Xt changes its value by an amount that is normally distributed with expectation Œº(Xt, t) Œ¥ and variance œÉ(Xt, t)2 Œ¥ and is independent of the past behavior of the process. This is so because the increments of a Wiener process are independent and normally distributed. The function Œº is referred to as the drift coefficient, while œÉ is called the diffusion coefficient. The stochastic process Xt is called a diffusion process, and satisfies the Markov property. The formal interpretation of an SDE is given in terms of what constitutes a solution to the SDE. There are two main definitions of a solution to an SDE, a strong solution and a weak solution. Both require the existence of a process Xt that solves the integral equation version of the SDE. The difference between the two lies in the underlying probability space (\\\\Omega,\\\\, \\\\mathcal{F},\\\\, P). A weak solution consists of a probability space and a process that satisfies the integral equation, while a strong solution is a process that satisfies the equation and is defined on a given probability space. An important example is the equation for geometric Brownian motion :\\\\mathrm{d} X_t = \\\\mu (X_t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} t + \\\\sigma (X_t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} B_t. which is the equation for the dynamics of the price of a stock in the Black‚ÄìScholes options pricing model of financial mathematics. There are also more general stochastic differential equations where the coefficients Œº and œÉ depend not only on the present value of the process Xt, but also on previous values of the process and possibly on present or previous values of other processes too. In that case the solution process, X, is not a Markov process, and it is called an It√¥ process and not a diffusion process. When the coefficients depends only on present and past values of X, the defining equation is called a stochastic delay differential equation. Existence and uniqueness of solutions As with deterministic ordinary and partial differential equations, it is important to know whether a given SDE has a solution, and whether or not it is unique. The following is a typical existence and uniqueness theorem for It√¥ SDEs taking values in n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn and driven by an m-dimensional Brownian motion B; the proof may be found in √òksendal (2003, ¬ß5.2). Let T > 0, and let :\\\\mu : \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\\\times [0, T] \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^{n}; :\\\\sigma : \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\\\times [0, T] \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times m}; be measurable functions for which there exist constants C and D such that :\\\\big \\\\mu (x, t) \\\\big + \\\\big \\\\sigma (x, t) \\\\big \\\\leq C \\\\big( 1 +  x  \\\\big); :\\\\big \\\\mu (x, t) - \\\\mu (y, t) \\\\big + \\\\big \\\\sigma (x, t) - \\\\sigma (y, t) \\\\big \\\\leq D  x - y ; for all t ‚àà [0, T] and all x and y ‚àà Rn, where : \\\\sigma ^{2} = \\\\sum_{i, j = 1}^{n}  \\\\sigma_{ij} ^{2}. Let Z be a random variable that is independent of the œÉ-algebra generated by Bs, s ‚â• 0, and with finite second moment: :\\\\mathbb{E} \\\\big[  Z ^{2} \\\\big] < \\\\+ \\\\infty. Then the stochastic differential equation/initial value problem :\\\\mathrm{d} X_{t} = \\\\mu (X_{t}, t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} t + \\\\sigma (X_{t}, t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} B_{t} \\\\mbox{ for } t \\\\in [0, T]; :X_{0} = Z; has a P-almost surely unique t-continuous solution (t, œâ) ‚Ü¶ Xt(œâ) such that X is adapted to the filtration FtZ generated by Z and Bs, s ‚â§ t, and :\\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left[ \\\\int_{0}^{T}  X_{t} ^{2} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} t \\\\right] < \\\\+ \\\\infty.

Its general solution is :X_t=h^{-1}(\\\\alpha t+W_t+h(X_0))  SDEs and supersymmetry  In supersymmetric theory of SDEs, stochastic dynamics is defined via stochastic evolution operator acting on the differential forms on the phase space of the model. In this exact formulation of stochastic dynamics, all SDEs possess topological supersymmetry which represents the preservation of the continuity of the phase space by continuous time flow. The spontaneous breakdown of this supersymmetry is the mathematical essence of the ubiquitous dynamical phenomenon known across disciplines as chaos, turbulence, self-organized criticality etc. and the Goldstone theorem explains the associated long-range dynamical behavior, i.e., the butterfly effect, 1/f and crackling noises, and scale-free statistics of earthquakes, neuroavalanches, solar flares etc. The theory also offers a resolution of the Ito‚ÄìStratonovich dilemma in favor of Stratonovich approach.

He succeeded to the title of Baron Melchett in 1973. Background The son of the British Steel Corporation chairman Sir Julian Mond (later the 3rd Baron Melchett) and Sonia Melchett (now Sinclair), Mond was educated at Eton and Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he read law. He went on to take an MA in criminology at Keele University, and later researched the sentencing of cannabis users at the London School of Economics and at the Institute of Psychiatry (1971‚Äì1973). In the late 1970s Melchett was the first chair of a (short-lived) Legalise Cannabis Campaign. For over 30 years, Lord Melchett was a patron of Prisoners Abroad, a registered charity that supports British citizens who are imprisoned overseas. He was a Special Lecturer at the School of Biological Sciences, University of Nottingham, from 1984 to 2002, a member of the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology (1981‚Äì1985), a member of the BBC's Rural Affairs Committee (2005‚Äì), the Government's Rural Climate Change Forum (2009‚Äì2010) and Organic Action Plan Group (2002‚Äì2008) and the Department of Education's School Lunches Review Panel (2005). Melchett was on the board of the EU ¬£12m Research Project 'Quality Low Input Food'. He received an honorary doctorate from Newcastle University in 2013. Political career Lord Melchett succeeded to his titles in 1973 upon the death of his father. When Labour won re-election in October 1974 he was made a Lord-in-waiting (House of Lords whip) by Harold Wilson, working in the Department of the Environment under Anthony Crosland. According to Wilson, he was the youngest government minister appointed at least in modern times, and he was promoted twice within two years. As well as departmental responsibilities, he took particularly controversial legislation through the House (including pension legislation and bills nationalising the aircraft and shipbuilding industries). At the Department of the Environment, he chaired a Government inquiry into the then controversial area of pop festivals, leading to legislation that is still in force (credited by Michael Eavis as the basis on which the Glastonbury Festival has been able to continue to flourish), and it ensured that some of the UK's first wildlife protection laws were passed. In 1975, he was made a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department of Industry, where he was responsible for small firms and workers cooperatives. When James Callaghan succeeded Wilson in 1976, Melchett moved to become Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, responsible for health (and social services) and education (including sports and the arts), two major departments covering almost the whole range of social policy, with by far the largest share of Government spending in Northern Ireland. Melchett increased teacher numbers to give the best pupil/teacher ratio in the UK, modernised provision for the mentally ill, and saw Northern Ireland provided with world class sporting facilities. He was responsible for the successful passage of a bill making it possible to set up integrated (non-sectarian) schools. In his book Minority Verdict ‚Äì Experiences of a Catholic Public Servant, Maurice Hayes, the most senior Roman Catholic civil servant in Northern Ireland, spoke very highly about working with Melchett: [He] \\"did not have everything spelled-out or interpreted for him. More important, he related to the young people around, he was mobile, accessible, and very attractive to large numbers of people. He also had a lot of courage and fighting for issues that did not fall within his brief, which involved some aspect of human rights or discrimination or criminal justice.\\" One such issue was a case in which Melchett helped to secure a pardon for a young girl who had been convicted and imprisoned for killing her father, who had sexually abused and assaulted the girl's mother and turned his attentions on her younger sister. In his book, Hayes also said: \\"Melchett chafed at the constraints that were put on him in the name of security or convention and on his ability to travel to any part of Northern Ireland. He went out as often as he could and on whatever pretext to what were regarded 'difficult areas' ‚Äì generally places that no minister had ever visited before, or any representative of government more exalted or benign than a policeman or a summons server ‚Äì and found the people always glad to see him.\\" After Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 election, Melchett served on the Opposition Front Bench in the House of Lords from 1979 to 1981, covering the environment and wildlife, and leading for the Opposition on the Wildlife and Countryside Bill, which became an Act in 1981. The bill faced around 1200 amendments at the Committee stage in the Lords, said to be more than any other Bill, many moved by Melchett. After amendments, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 introduced proper protection for key wildlife sites (Sites of Special Scientific Interest) and additional protection for numerous species, including (controversially) bats, and Melchett's personal favourite, protection from shooting for the Curlew, insisted on by the Lords after initial protection introduced in the Lords was rejected by the Commons. Career after politics Immediately after he ceased be a minister in 1979, Melchett was appointed part-time Chairman of Community Industry, a government funded scheme run by the National Association of Youth Clubs, which employed 8,000 young people in particularly deprived areas in England, Scotland and Wales. Community Industry aimed to give the experience of working in a real job, with a wage, to young people who were unable to get a job because of severe disadvantage. People were employed in groups of around 10, under the supervision of an experienced craftsperson, to learn basic skills and to get used to the routine of regular work. Melchett left Community Industry in 1986. From 1979 to 1985, Melchett worked in a voluntary capacity for a number of wildlife groups and for the Ramblers' Association as President from 1981 to 1984 and Vice President from 1984. He also served for a spell on the Ramblers‚Äô Council, which he claimed was his only elected office. In that period, he was also a Council member of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and help found and chaired (1980‚Äì1987) the national liaison body for wildlife and environment groups, Wildlife Link (now Wildlife and Countryside Link), which brought together around 30 NGOs, including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, which had been excluded from previous liaison arrangements. He was a Trustee of WWF UK from 1977 to 1984 and an advisor to Friends of the Earth and the RSPCA. In 1985, he took part in peaceful protest organised by the Snowball movement, at the Sculthorpe US nuclear air force base close to the farm in Norfolk. Along with many other protesters, he and his partner, Cassandra Wedd, made a symbolic cut to the fence around the air base, and they were arrested and convicted of attempted criminal damage. Having announced himself sick of the 'lying game' of Westminster politics, and partly on the strength of his antinuclear campaigning and direct action, Lord Melchett was appointed to the Board of Greenpeace UK in 1985, and then took up position of Executive Director of Greenpeace UK in 1989.[4] Greenpeace UK grew from an organisation with a turnover of ¬£1.4m, 12 staff and 25,000 supporters in 1985, to a turnover of ¬£7.5m, 80 staff and over 200,000 supporters in 2001. Greenpeace UK's financial contribution to Greenpeace International increased from ¬£166,000 to ¬£2m, and increased as a proportion of gross income from 5% to 25%. Greenpeace campaign successes in that period included a decrease in whales killed worldwide from around 70,000 to 1,000, international treaties banning the dumping of nuclear, industrial and oil industry waste (including Shell's controversial Brent Spar oil storage facility) and human sewage in the North East Atlantic, an international treaty protecting the continent of Antarctica, the temporary abandonment of building new nuclear power stations in the UK, the treaty banning nuclear weapons testing worldwide, and Greenpeace's worldwide, campaign against genetically modified crops and food. Greenpeace launched its global campaign against GM crops in 1997, and Lord Melchett was arrested in 1999 when he took part in an environmental protest against a genetically modified crop trial in Norfolk, at which GM maize was cut down and removed by 28 volunteers. Melchett spent a night in police custody and then a night in Norwich Prison before being released on bail. The case came to court in 2000 when Melchett and his 27 codefendants were unanimously acquitted of theft and criminal damage. When he left in 2001, Melchett was the longest serving Executive Director of a Greenpeace national office. The UK model of campaigning was increasingly adopted by Greenpeace's other 30 national offices and was accepted as being in part responsible for Greenpeace's successes with both the Brent Spar and genetic engineering campaigns. Melchett was also Chair of the Board of Greenpeace Japan, which became the third largest and most influential environmental organisation in Japan, securing a number of significant changes in Government policy and corporate behaviour. When he retired as Greenpeace's Executive Director, he remained on the organisation's international board and took up a part-time consultancy work with IKEA, Iceland and ASDA supermarkets, and briefly with industry PR company Burson- Marsteller UK.[6] Burson-Marsteller in the USA had formerly been PR consultants for the Monsanto Company, and Lord Melchett stood down from the Greenpeace International Board following accusation that his employment with Burson-Marsteller compromised his integrity. He was Policy Director at the Soil Association from 2002. The Soil Association has campaigned against the introduction of GM crops and food, and for the introduction of support for English organic farmers through the Government's Organic Entry Level Scheme (subsequently Countryside Stewardship). The Soil Association has published reports and campaigned on school, nursery and hospital food, the poor quality of children's food in popular restaurants, organic farming and climate change, the nutritional value of organic food, resource use in agriculture, feeding the world, GM, pesticides, the abuse of antibiotics in livestock farming and animal welfare. Melchett played a leading role in guiding the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics,http://www.saveourantibiotics.org/ an alliance of health, environmental and animal-welfare groups ‚Äì coordinated by non-governmental organisations Compassion in World Farming,https://www.ciwf.org.uk/ the Soil Association and Sustain: the alliance for better food and farming,https://www.sustainweb.org/ campaigning to stop the overuse of antibiotics in livestock. The Alliance was founded in 2009 and has helped put the issue of antibiotic resistance at the centre of farm policy. By 2018, large cuts in antibiotic use in British farming had been achieved, and the European Union had agreed to plansHalting spread of drug resistance from animals to humans: deal with Council http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20180605IPR05050/halting- spread-of-drug-resistance-from-animals-to-humans-deal-with-council; 5 June 2018; European Parliament; retrieved 31 August 2018 to ban routine farm antibiotic use. Melchett was one of the leading people responsible for launching the Soil Association's successful school food programme, Food for Life and Food for Life Served Here, a certification scheme for healthy and sustainable catering, currently covering 1.7 million meals served outside the home daily. He was the first Chair of the Food for Life Partnership, led by the Soil Association ‚Äì originally in partnership with the Focus on Food Campaign, Garden Organic and the Health Education Trust, awarded a five-year, ¬£16.9m Big Lottery grant (2007‚Äì2011) that resulted in engagement with 20% of English schools (which now covers over half the primary schools in England), and which is delivering radical improvements in school meal take-up, significant improvements in attendance, behaviour and academic achievement, and major improvements in children's and their parents‚Äô diets. From 1973, Melchett was the managing director of 890-acre (360 hectares) Courtyard Farm at Ringstead near Hunstanton,[5],which was owned by his father, and is now owned by a charitable trust. The farm fully converted to organic in 2000, and crops include barley, wheat, and beans, all grown for seed, and clover and grass for cattle feed. The prize-winning farm is well known for the wildlife conservation work done there over the last 50 years, and for the high level of public access provided for more than 30 years. The farm has been involved in numerous agricultural and conservation research projects. Personal life Peter Melchett was in a relationship with Cassandra \\"Cass\\" Wedd for 45 years, although they were never married. They had two children who were educated at a comprehensive school instead of the family tradition of Eton College. Lord Melchett's daughter Jessica Joan Mond-Wedd is a barrister, whilst his son, Justin \\"Jay\\"Julian Mond Wedd, is a farmer. Lord Melchett was a vocal opponent of hereditary peerdomObituary in The Guardian and declared in a BBC radio broadcast for Desert Island DiscsPeter Melchett on Desert Island Discs with Sue Lawley that he had deprived his son Jay (who farms at the family farm in Ringstead) of the right to succeed him as 5th Baron Melchett of Landford in the county of Southampton and 5th Baronet of Hartford Hill in the county of Cheshire, arguably because his son was born out of wedlock. This meant the extinction of the barony and of the baronetcy.

The \\"televisor\\" (right) which produces the picture uses a spinning metal disk with a series of holes in it, called a Nipkow disk, in front of a neon lamp. Each hole in the disk passing in front of the lamp produces a scan line which makes up the image. The video signal from the television receiver unit (left) is applied to the neon lamp, causing its brightness to vary with the brightness of the image at each point. This system produced a dim orange image square, with 48 scan lines, at a frame rate of 7.5 frames per second. Mechanical television or mechanical scan television is a television system that relies on a mechanical scanning device, such as a rotating disk with holes in it or a rotating mirror drum, to scan the scene and generate the video signal, and a similar mechanical device at the receiver to display the picture. This contrasts with vacuum tube electronic television technology, using electron beam scanning methods, for example in cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions. Subsequently, modern solid-state liquid-crystal displays (LCD) are now used to create and display television pictures. Mechanical-scanning methods were used in the earliest experimental television systems in the 1920s and 1930s. One of the first experimental wireless television transmissions was by John Logie Baird on October 02, 1925, in London. By 1928 many radio stations were broadcasting experimental television programs using mechanical systems. However the technology never produced images of sufficient quality to become popular with the public. Mechanical-scan systems were largely superseded by electronic-scan technology in the mid-1930s, which was used in the first commercially successful television broadcasts which began in the late 1930s in Great Britain. A mechanical television receiver is also called a televisor in some countries.  History  = Early research = The first mechanical raster scanning techniques were developed in the 19th century for facsimile, the transmission of still images by wire. Alexander Bain introduced the facsimile machine in 1843 to 1846. Frederick Bakewell demonstrated a working laboratory version in 1851. The first practical facsimile system, working on telegraph lines, was developed and put into service by Giovanni Caselli from 1856 onward.Huurdeman, p. 149 The first telefax machine to be used in practical operation was invented by an Italian priest and professor of physics, Giovanni Caselli (1815‚Äì1891).Beyer, p. 100 The telegraph was the hot new technology of the moment, and Caselli wondered if it was possible to send pictures over telegraph wires. He went to work in 1855, and over the course of six years perfected what he called the \\"pantelegraph.\\" It was the world's first practical fax machine. Willoughby Smith discovered the photoconductivity of the element selenium in 1873, laying the groundwork for the selenium cell which was used as a pickup in most mechanical scan systems. In 1885, Henry Sutton in Ballarat, Australia designed a Telephane for transmission of images via telegraph wires, based on the Nipkow spinning disk system, selenium photocell, Nicol prisms and Kerr effect cell. Sutton's design was published internationally in 1890.1885 Telephane system diagrams ‚Äì Telegraphic Journal and Electrical Review 7 November 1890 An account of its use to transmit and preserve a still image was published in the Evening Star in Washington in 1896.Pictures by Wire, The Evening Star, (Saturday, 16 October, 1896), p.3. Ernst Ruhmer demonstrating his experimental television system, which was capable of transmitting images of simple shapes over telephone lines, using a 25-element selenium cell receiver (1909)\\"Another Electric Distance-Seer\\", Literary Digest, September 11, 1909, page 384. The first demonstration of the instantaneous transmission of images was made by a German physicist, Ernst Ruhmer, who arranged 25 selenium cells as the picture elements for a television receiver. In late 1909 he successfully demonstrated in Belgium the transmission of simple images over a telephone wire from the Palace of Justice at Brussels to the city of Liege, a distance of . This demonstration was described at the time as \\"the world's first working model of television apparatus\\".\\"Seeing by Wire\\", Industrial World, January 31, 1910, pp. viii-x (reprinted from the London Mail). The limited number of elements meant his device was only capable of representing simple geometric shapes, and the cost was very high; at a price of ¬£15 (US$45) per selenium cell, he estimated that a 4,000 cell system would cost ¬£60,000 (US$180,000), and a 10,000 cell mechanism capable of reproducing \\"a scene or event requiring the background of a landscape\\" would cost ¬£150,000 (US$450,000). Ruhmer expressed the hope that the 1910 Brussels Exposition Universelle et Internationale would sponsor the construction of an advanced device with significantly more cells, as a showcase for the exposition. However, the estimated expense of ¬£250,000 (US$750,000) proved to be too high.Ibid. The publicity generated by Ruhmer's demonstration spurred two French scientists, Georges Rignoux and A. Fournier in Paris, to announce similar research that they had been conducting.\\"Television on the Way\\", Kansas City Star, January 30, 1910, p. 20C. (Reprinted in American Broadcasting, edited by Lawrence W. Lichty and Malachi C. Topping, 1976, pp. 45-46.) A matrix of 64 selenium cells, individually wired to a mechanical commutator, served as an electronic retina. In the receiver, a type of Kerr cell modulated the light and a series of variously angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen. A separate circuit regulated synchronization. The 8 x 8 pixel resolution in this proof-of-concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet.\\"Television 'In Sight'\\", The Literary Digest, January 2, 1910, pp. 138-139. An updated image was transmitted \\"several times\\" each second.Henry de Varigny, \\"La vision √† distance \\", L'Illustration, Paris, December 11, 1909, p. 451. In 1911, Boris Rosing and his student Vladimir Zworykin created a system that used a mechanical mirror-drum scanner to transmit, in Zworykin's words, \\"very crude images\\" over wires to the \\"Braun tube\\" (cathode ray tube or \\"CRT\\") in the receiver. Moving images were not possible because, in the scanner, \\"the sensitivity was not enough and the selenium cell was very laggy\\".R. W. Burns, Television: An International History of the Formative Years, IET, 1998, p. 119. . = Television demonstrations = The Nipkow disk. This schematic shows the circular paths traced by the holes, that may also be square for greater precision. The area of the disk outlined in black shows the region scanned. As a 23-year-old German university student, Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow proposed and patented the Nipkow disk in 1884.Shiers, George and May (1997), Early Television: A Bibliographic Guide to 1940. Taylor & Francis, pp. 13, 22. . This was a spinning disk with a spiral pattern of holes in it, so each hole scanned a line of the image. Although he never built a working model of the system, Nipkow's spinning-disk \\"image rasterizer\\" was the key mechanism used in most mechanical scan systems, in both the transmitter and receiver.Shiers & Shiers, p. 13, 22. Constantin Perskyi had coined the word television in a paper read to the International Electricity Congress at the International World Fair in Paris on August 24, 1900. Perskyi's paper reviewed the existing electromechanical technologies, mentioning the work of Nipkow and others.\\"T√©l√©vision au moyen de l'√©lectricit√©\\", Congr√®s Inographs by Telegraph\\", The New York Times, Sunday Magazine, September 20, 1907, p. 7. However, it was the 1907 invention of the first amplifying vacuum tube, the triode, by Lee de Forest, that made the design practical.\\"Sending Photographs by Telegraph\\", The New York Times, Sunday Magazine, September 20, 1907, p. 7. Scottish inventor John Logie Baird in 1925 built some of the first prototype video systems, which employed the Nipkow disk. On March 25, 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised silhouette images in motion, at Selfridge's Department Store in London. Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a ventriloquist's dummy named \\"Stooky Bill\\" talking and moving, whose painted face had higher contrast. By January 26, 1926, he demonstrated the transmission of image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as being the world's first public television demonstration. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A brightly illuminated subject was placed in front of a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses which swept images across a static photocell. The thallium sulphide (Thalofide) cell, developed by Theodore Case in the USA, detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal. This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one scan line of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face. In 1927, Baird transmitted a signal over of telephone line between London and Glasgow. In 1928, Baird's company (Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television) broadcast the first transatlantic television signal, between London and New York, and the first shore-to-ship transmission. In 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany. In November of the same year, Baird and Bernard Natan of Path√© established France's first television company, T√©l√©vision-Baird-Natan. In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of The Derby.J. L. Baird, \\"Television in 1932\\", BBC Annual Report, 1933. In 1932, he demonstrated ultra-short wave television. Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240-lines of resolution on BBC television broadcasts in 1936 though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly. Instead a 17.5 mm film was shot, rapidly developed and then scanned while the film was still wet. An American inventor, Charles Francis Jenkins also pioneered the television. He published an article on \\"Motion Pictures by Wireless\\" in 1913, but it was not until December 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses, and it was on June 13, 1925, that he publicly demonstrated synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures. In 1925 Jenkins used Nipkow disk and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion, over a distance of from a naval radio station in Maryland to his laboratory in Washington, D.C., using a lensed disk scanner with a 48-line resolution.\\"Radio Shows Far Away Objects in Motion\\", The New York Times, June 14, 1925, p. 1. He was granted the U.S. patent No. 1,544,156 (Transmitting Pictures over Wireless) on June 30, 1925 (filed March 13, 1922). On December 25, 1925, Kenjiro Takayanagi demonstrated a television system with a 40-line resolution that employed a Nipkow disk scanner and CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. This prototype is still on display at the Takayanagi Memorial Museum in Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu Campus.Kenjiro Takayanagi: The Father of Japanese Television, NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), 2002, retrieved 2009-05-23. By 1927, he improved the resolution to 100 lines, which was unrivaled until 1931.High Above: The untold story of Astra, Europe's leading satellite company, page 220, Springer Science+Business Media By 1928, he was the first to transmit human faces in half-tones. His work had an influence on the later work of Vladimir K. Zworykin.Albert Abramson, Zworykin, Pioneer of Television, University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 231. . By 1935, Takayanagi had developed a vacuum tube electronic television.Popular Photography, November 1990, page 5 His research in creating a production model was halted by the US after Japan lost World War II. Herbert E. Ives and Frank Gray of Bell Telephone Laboratories gave a dramatic demonstration of mechanical television on April 7, 1927. The reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens. The small receiver had a screen (width by height). The large receiver had a screen (width by height). Both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate, monochromatic moving images. Along with the pictures, the sets also received synchronized sound. The system transmitted images over two paths: first, a copper wire link from Washington to New York City, then a radio link from Whippany, New Jersey. Comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality. Subjects of the telecast included Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover. A flying-spot scanner beam illuminated these subjects. The scanner that produced the beam had a 50-aperture disk. The disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 milliseconds. (Today's systems typically transmit 30 or 60 frames per second, or one frame every 33.3 or 16.7 milliseconds respectively.) Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration: \\"It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time. It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality.\\"Abramson, Albert, The History of Television, 1880 to 1941, McFarland & Co., Inc., 1987, p. 101. . In 1928, General Electric launched their own experimental television station W2XB, broadcasting from the GE plant in Schenectady, New York. The station was popularly known as \\"WGY Television\\", named after the GE owned radio station WGY. The station eventually converted to an all-electronic system in the 1930s and in 1942, received a commercial license as WRGB. The station is still operating today. Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union, L√©on Theremin had been developing a mirror drum-based television, starting with 16 lines resolution in 1925, then 32 lines and eventually 64 using interlacing in 1926, and as part of his thesis on May 7, 1926, he electrically transmitted and then projected near-simultaneous moving images on a square screen. By 1927 he achieved an image of 100 lines, a resolution that was not surpassed until 1931 by RCA, with 120 lines. Because only a limited number of holes could be made in the disks, and disks beyond a certain diameter became impractical, image resolution on mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low, ranging from about 30 lines up to 120 or so. Nevertheless, the image quality of 30-line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances, and by 1933 the UK broadcasts using the Baird system were remarkably clear.Donald F. McLean, Restoring Baird's Image (London: IEEE, 2000), p. 184. A few systems ranging into the 200-line region also went on the air. Two of these were the 180-line system that Compagnie des Compteurs (CDC) installed in Paris in 1935, and the 180-line system that Peck Television Corp. started in 1935 at station VE9AK in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Block diagram of General Electric mechanical scan television system, Radio News (April 1928) = Color television = A color televisor. A test card (the famous test card F) can just be seen through the lens on the right. John Baird's 1928 color television experiments had inspired Goldmark's more advanced field-sequential color system.The Smith, Kline & French Medical Color TV Unit. The CBS color television system of Peter Goldmark used such technology in 1940.CBS Field Sequential Color System . In Goldmark's system, stations transmit color saturation values electronically. Yet mechanical methods also come into play. At the transmitting camera, a mechanical disc filters hues (colors) from reflected studio lighting. At the receiver, a synchronized disc paints the same hues over the CRT. As the viewer watches pictures through the color disc, the pictures appear in full color. Of course, simultaneous color systems superseded the CBS-Goldmark system. Yet mechanical color methods continued to find uses. Early color sets were very expensive, over $1,000 in the money of the time. Inexpensive adapters allowed owners of black-and-white, NTSC television sets to receive color telecasts. The most prominent of these adapters is Col-R-Tel, a 1955 NTSC to field-sequential converter.Hawes Mechanical Television Archive, How Col-R-Tel Works. This system operates at NTSC scanning rates, but uses a disc like the obsolete CBS system had. The disc converts the black-and-white set to a field-sequential set. Meanwhile, Col-R-Tel electronics recover NTSC color signals and sequence them for disc reproduction. The electronics also synchronize the disc to the NTSC system. In Col-R-Tel, the electronics provide the saturation values (chroma). These electronics cause chroma values to superimpose over brightness (luminance) changes of the picture. The disc paints the hues (color) over the picture. A few years after Col-R-Tel, Apollo moon missions also adopted field-sequential techniques. The lunar color cameras all had color wheels. These Westinghouse and later RCA cameras sent field-sequential color television pictures to earth. The earth receiving stations included mechanical equipment that converted these pictures to standard television formats. = Decline = The advancement of vacuum tube, electronic television (including image dissectors and other camera tubes and cathode ray tubes for the reproducer) marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television. Mechanical TV usually only produced small images. It was the main type of TV until the 1930s. Vacuum tube television, first demonstrated in September 1927 in San Francisco by Philo Farnsworth, and then publicly by Farnsworth at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia in 1934, was rapidly overtaking mechanical television. Farnsworth's system was first used for broadcasting in 1936, reaching 400 to more than 600 lines with fast field scan rates, along with competing systems by Philco and DuMont Laboratories. In 1939, RCA paid Farnsworth $1 million for his patents after ten years of litigation, and RCA began demonstrating all-electronic television at the 1939 World's Fair in New York City. The last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the United States. = Modern applications of mechanical scanning = Since the 1970s, some amateur radio enthusiasts have experimented with mechanical systems. The early light source of a neon lamp has now been replaced with super-bright LEDs. There is some interest in creating these systems for narrow-bandwidth television, which would allow a small or large moving image to fit into a channel less than 40 kHz wide (modern TV systems usually have a channel about 6 MHz wide, 150 times larger). Also associated with this is slow-scan TV - although that typically used electronic systems utilising the P7 CRT until the 1980s and PCs thereafter. There are three known mechanical monitor forms. Two fax printer like monitors made in the 1970s and in 2013 a small drum monitor with a coating of glow paint where the image is painted on the rotating drum with a UV laser. Digital Light Processing (DLP) projectors use an array of tiny (16 Œºm2) electrostatically-actuated mirrors selectively reflecting a light source to create an image. Many low-end DLP systems also use a color wheel to provide a sequential color image, a feature that was common on many early color television systems before the shadow mask CRT provided a practical method for producing a simultaneous color image. Another place where high- quality imagery is produced by opto-mechanics is the laser printer, where a small rotating mirror is used to deflect a modulated laser beam in one axis while the motion of the photoconductor provides the motion in the other axis. A modification of such a system using high power lasers is used in laser video projectors, with resolutions as high as 1024 lines and each line containing >1500 points. Such systems produce, arguably, the best quality video images. They are used, for instance, in planetariums. The long wave infrared cameras used in military applications such as giving fighter pilots night vision. These cameras use a high sensitivity infrared photo receptor (usually cooled to increase sensitivity), but instead of disks of lenses, these systems use rotating prisms to provide a 525 or 625 line standard video output. The optical parts are made from germanium, because glass is opaque at the wavelengths involved. These cameras have found a new role in sporting events where they are able to show (for example) where a ball has struck a bat. Laser lighting display techniques are combined with computer emulation in the LaserMAME project. It is a vector-based system, unlike the raster displays thus-far described. Laser light reflected from computer-controlled mirrors traces out images generated by classic arcade software which is executed by a specially modified version of the MAME emulation software. Television Machine with 4 LED ‚Äì Strips  Technical aspects  = Flying spot scanners = Flying spot scanner in a television studio in 1931. This type was used for \\"head shots\\" of performers speaking, singing or playing instruments. A bright spot of light projected from the lens at center scanned the subject's face, and the light reflected at each point was picked up by the 8 phototubes in the dish-shaped mirrors. The most common method for creating the video signal was the \\"flying spot scanner\\", developed as a remedy for the low sensitivity that photoelectric cells had at the time. Instead of a television camera that took pictures, a flying spot scanner projected a bright spot of light that scanned rapidly across the subject scene in a raster pattern, in a darkened studio. The light reflected from the subject was picked up by banks of photoelectric cells and amplified to become the video signal. In the scanner the narrow light beam was produced by an arc lamp shining through the holes in a spinning Nipkow disk. Each sweep of the spot across the scene produced a \\"scan line\\" of the picture. A single \\"frame\\" of the picture was typically made up of 24, 48, or 60 scan lines. The scene was typically scanned 15 or 20 times per second, producing 15 or 20 video frames per second. The varying brightness of the point where the spot fell reflected varying amounts of light, which was converted to a proportionally varying electronic signal by the photoelectric cells. To achieve adequate sensitivity, instead of a single cell, a number of photoelectric cells were used. Like mechanical television itself, flying spot technology grew out of phototelegraphy (facsimile). This scanning method began in the 19th century. The BBC television service used the flying spot method until 1935. German television used flying spot methods as late as 1938. This year was by far not the end of flying spot scanner technology. The German inventor Manfred von Ardenne designed a flying spot scanner with a CRT as the light source. In the 1950s, DuMont marketed Vitascan, an entire flying-spot color studio system. Today, graphic scanners still use this scanning method. The flying spot method has two disadvantages: * Actors must perform in near darkness; * Flying spot cameras tend to work unreliably outdoors in daylight. In 1928, Ray Kell from the United States' General Electric proved that flying spot scanners could work outdoors. The scanning light source must be brighter than other incident illumination. Kell was the engineer who ran a 24-line camera that telecast pictures of New York governor Al Smith. Smith was accepting the Democratic nomination for presidency. As Smith stood outside the capital in Albany, Kell managed to send usable pictures to his associate Bedford at station WGY, which was broadcasting Smith's speech. The rehearsal went well, but then the real event began. The newsreel cameramen switched on their floodlights. Unfortunately for Kell, his scanner only had a 1 kW lamp inside it. The floodlights threw much more light on Governor Smith. These floods simply overwhelmed Kell's imaging photocells. In fact, the floods made the unscanned part of the image as bright as the scanned part. Kell's photocells couldn't discriminate reflections off Smith (from the AC scanning beam) from the flat, DC light from the floodlamps. The effect is very similar to extreme overexposure in a still camera: The scene disappears, and the camera records a flat, bright light. Use the camera in favorable conditions, though, and the picture comes out fine. Similarly, Kell proved that outdoors in favorable conditions, his scanner worked fine. A scene being televised by flying spot scanner in a television studio in 1931. The Nipkow disk in the flying spot scanner (bottom) projects a spot of light that scans the subject in a raster pattern in the darkened studio. Nearby photocell pickup units convert the reflected light to a signal proportional to the brightness of the reflected area, which goes through the control board to the transmitter. = Larger videos = A few mechanical TV systems could produce images several feet or meters wide and of comparable quality to the cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions that were to follow. CRT technology at that time was limited to small, low-brightness screens. One such system was developed by Ulises Armand Sanabria in Chicago. By 1934, Sanabria demonstrated a projection system which had a image. Perhaps the best mechanical televisions of the 1930s used the Scophony system, which could produce images of more than 400 lines and display them on screens at least in size (at least a few models of this type were actually produced). The Scophony system used multiple drums rotating at fairly high speed to create the images. One using a 441-line American standard of the day had a small drum rotating at 39,690 rpm (a second slower drum moved at just a few hundred rpm). = Aspect ratios = Some mechanical equipment scanned lines vertically rather than horizontally, as in modern TVs. An example of this method is the Baird 30-line system. Baird's British system created a picture in the shape of a very narrow, vertical rectangle. This shape created a portrait image, instead of the landscape orientation that is common today. The position of a framing mask before the Nipkow disk determines the scan line orientation. Placement of the framing mask at the left or right side of the disk gives vertical scan lines. Placement at the top or bottom of the disk gives horizontal scan lines. Baird's earliest television images had very low definition. These images could only show one person clearly. For this reason, a vertical, portrait image made more sense to Baird than a horizontal, landscape image. Baird chose a shape three units wide by seven high. Actually this shape is only about half as wide as a traditional portrait and close in proportion to a typical doorway. Instead of entertainment television, Baird might have had point-to-point communication in mind. Another television system followed that reasoning. The 1927 system developed by Herbert E. Ives at AT&T;'s Bell Laboratories was a large-screen television system and the most advanced television of its day. The Ives 50-line system also produced a vertical \\"portrait\\" picture. Since AT&T; intended to use television for telephony, the vertical shape was logical: phone calls are usually conversations between just two people. A picturephone system would depict one person on each side of the line. Meanwhile, in the US, Germany and elsewhere, other inventors planned to use television for entertainment purposes. These inventors began with square or landscape pictures. (For example, consider the television systems of these men: Ernst Alexanderson, Frank Conrad, Charles Francis Jenkins, William PeckMedia quotations. and Ulises Armand Sanabria.) These inventors realized that television is about relationships between people. From the very beginning, these inventors allowed picture space for two-shots. Soon, images increased to 60 lines or more. The camera could easily photograph several people at once. Then even Baird switched his picture mask to a horizontal image. Baird's \\"zone television\\" is an early example of rethinking his extremely narrow screen format. For entertainment and most other purposes, even today, landscape remains the more practical shape.  Recording  In the days of commercial mechanical television transmissions, a system of recording images (but not sound) was developed, using a modified gramophone recorder. Marketed as \\"Phonovision\\", this system, which was never fully perfected, proved to be complicated to use as well as quite expensive, yet managed to preserve a number of early broadcast images that would otherwise have been lost. Scottish computer engineer Donald F. McLean has painstakingly reconstructed the analogue playback technology required to view these recordings, and has given lectures and presentations on his collection of mechanical television recordings made between 1925 and 1933.The World's Earliest Television Recordings. Among the discs in Dr. McLean's collection are a number of test recordings made by television pioneer John Logie Baird himself. One disc, dated \\"28th March 1928\\" and marked with the title \\"Miss Pounsford\\", shows several minutes of a woman's face in what appears to be very animated conversation. In 1993, the woman was identified by relatives as Mabel Pounsford, and her brief appearance on the disc is one of the earliest known television video recordings of a human.Phonovision: The Recovered Images.

W. J. (2002). \\"Automakers in the fast lane\\". The China Business Review: 29(4) is a Chinese state-owned automobile manufacturer headquartered in Wuhu, Anhui, China. Chery's principal products are passenger cars, minivans, and SUVs; it sells passenger cars under the Chery marque and commercial vehicles under the Karry brand. Chery is the 10th-largest China-based automaker measured by 2012 output (around 590,000 units). Chery began the production of automobiles in 1999 and their export from China in 2001. It has been China's largest passenger car exporter since 2003, and in 2011 exported around 25% of its total production.This assertion is supported by multiple sources: * For total 2011 production of 641,700 units, see * For 2011 export of 158,900 units, It operates a 50:50 joint venture with Kenon Holdings, Qoros, which was formed in 2007 and sells a range of premium vehicles in emerging markets. In 2012, Jaguar Land Rover formed a 50:50 joint venture dubbed Chery Jaguar Land Rover for the production of Jaguar and Land Rover cars in China with Chery. Chery has several vehicle assembly and component manufacturing facilities in mainland China, and its vehicles are assembled in around 15 other countries‚Äîprimarily in factories not owned by the company that use either complete or semicomplete knock-down kits. It has two domestic R&D; centers and invests around 7% of its total revenues in product development. Its QQ city car, considered to be the best-known Chery model,Geoff Dyer, in Shanghai. \\"FT.Com Site : Proton in Talks with Chery Over Manufacturing.\\" FT.Com (30 March 2006) spawned a subbrand in its own right; the QQ6 and the QQme are two other cars produced by the company, and the original QQ may now be designated the QQ3. Since the early 2000s, Chery has received criticism for myriad alleged infringements of foreign manufacturers' intellectual property rights. Several Chery vehicles appear to have directly copied design elements from various foreign manufacturers. Some also criticize the company's name 'Chery' itself, which looks reminiscent of 'Chevy', the shortened name for GM's Chevrolet brand. History =1997 to 2010= Chery SQR7160 Fengyun Chery was founded in 1997 as a state-owned enterprise by a group of officials from Anhui province and began automobile production in 1999Fairclough, G. (4 December 2007). \\"Accelerating growth: In china, chery automobile drives an industry shift; low costs, high output attract global partners; chrysler's leap of faith\\". The Wall Street Journal, pp. A.1-A.1 using a chassis licensed from Volkswagen's SEAT Toledo. Called the Fengyun, Chery's first car sold nearly 30,000 units. The Wall Street Journal has described Chery's corporate culture as \\"an odd hybrid of Communist state enterprise and entrepreneurial start-up\\", and entrepreneurial risk-taking is evident in its early history. Initial production was technically illegal as the company was only awarded a passenger car production license in 2003, so while its first product rolled off the line in December 1999, it could not be legally sold until 2001. In that year, Chery solved the problem by piggybacking on a SAIC Motor license, which it did until 2003. Perhaps the 20% ownership stake in Chery that SAIC once held was compensation for this early favor, but the ownership was soon sold due to rising tensions between Chery and another SAIC partner, General Motors.McGregor, R. (14 June 2004). \\"SAIC severs links with chery\\". Financial Times. GM is not the only foreign partner of SAIC to have been exasperated with Chery; Volkswagen claims Chery was using tooling from an old VW factory to produce a model that resembled a Jetta circa 2003.\\"Eat your hat\\". (2003). Business Asia: 35(17) In the late 2000s, Chery began to actively seek a partnership with a foreign automaker, a hallmark of major Chinese car makers. Tie-ups with both Chrysler and Fiat were touted, but fell through. In 2007, Chrysler planned a cooperation with Chery that would have seen the Chery A1 sold as a Dodge-brand car in the US and abroad. The plan would have quickly increased the Chrysler small car stable, and the two companies participated in a signing ceremony in late 2007. In early 2008, a similar deal was reached between Chrysler and Nissan, however, and the Chrysler-Chery cooperation was abandoned. Around the time of the 2009 Chrysler Chapter 11 reorganization, Chrysler discussed the possibility of an asset sale with Chery. Chery V5, produced since 2008 In 2007, Fiat and Chery signed a memorandum of understanding for the creation of a car-making joint venture. Intended to begin operations in 2009, it was to manufacture Fiat and Alfa Romeo-branded products for the Chinese market and be located in Maka Wuhu. The deal was put on hold in March 2009. As of 2012, Fiat produces in China with local partner GAC Group. Qoros, a car-making joint venture between Chery and Singapore-based Kenon Holdings, was established in 2007. In October 2009, Chery announced plans for an assembly plant in Turkey to be built in cooperation with the Turkish automaker Mermerler Otomotiv at a cost of $500 million. The plant is planned to have an initial capacity of 20,000 units per year, rising to 100,000 by 2017. As of 2012, the plant has yet to commence production. When it comes online, this production base will add to a handful of joint venture factories that Chery has in places like Argentina and Iran. These stand in contrast to a number of factories outside China that assemble Chery vehicles, but in which Chery does not have an ownership stake. In 2009, Chery produced 508,500 units, and at this time it had an annual production capacity around 650,000 units. More than 400,000 of its 2009 sales were sedans. Production capacity figures may consider engines and vehicles as discrete. =2010 to present= Chery became the seventh-most productive Chinese vehicle manufacturer in 2010 by selling nearly 700,000 units. Slipping sales marked 2011 and 2012; in these years, the company produced more than 640,000 and near 590,000 units, respectively, and it moved from a seventh to a tenth-place ranking.For 2011 sales figures, see *For 2012 sales figures, see This decrease may be due to Chery's manufacturing mix being significantly different from those of other, major Chinese automakers; the company does make commercial vehicles, but SUVs comprise only 14% of its product line. An agreement with Tata Motors was struck in March 2012 to produce Jaguar Land Rover models in China. In 2013, a Tata executive stated that this deal was \\"still on track\\", and some expect the planned production base to start output in 2014. In June 2012, plans to build a production base in Malaysia were announced, and as of July 2012, this project is proceeding without a local partner. The planned factory will have a production capacity of 10,000 units per year. After having introduced the Karry, Rely, and Riich subbrands in 2009, its sprawling production policy and lineup became a problem for Chery. With over 100 new models in the works, Chery decided in the fall of 2012 to cancel the Rely and Riich brands and to narrow its focus. As of 2012, 30 new models are planned a significant reduction from the prior future lineup. In 2018, Chery sold 50% of its stocks in Brazil to CAOA group. In November 2019, Chery has authorized UAGGI in Philippines for new Chery Dealer in Philippines. Operations Chery A3 =Mainland China= Chery's main production base in the mainland of China is located in Anhui. As of 2007, the company had two auto-making production bases, two engine-making facilities, and a gearbox production base. Another car-making production base located in Dalian, Liaoning province, became operational in 2012. Chery invests around 7% of its total sales in research and development, and, as of 2011, had over 4,000 patents. It has R&D; facilities in Wuhu, Anhui province, and Changshu, Jiangsu province. =Other= A number of factories in developing countries manufacture Chery vehicles from either complete or semi-complete knock-down kits. With the exception of an Argentine cooperation, and an Iranian factory, these are not owned by Chery. As of the beginning of 2012, 13 operational factories produced Chery vehicles and an additional three were in development. These factories have appeared in Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, the Middle East, North Africa, Pakistan, Uruguay, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, Ukraine, Venezuela and Vietnam. Brazil Chery has a production base in Jacarei, Brazil, that began construction in July 2011, in a joint effort with the government of the state of S√£o Paulo. The plant began operating in August 2014, with a first-phase production capacity of 50,000 units per year. In phase two, the plant will achieve an annual production capacity of 150,000 units. The models produced there have been the hybrid-powered Celer (since October 2014), the QQ (since the second half of 2015), Tiggo 2 (since mid-2017)https://carros.ig.com.br/2017-07-14/chery-tiggo-2-producao.html and Arrizo 5 (since October 2018).https://www.autoindustria.com.br/2018/10/22/caoa-chery-inicia-producao- do-arrizo-5/ Its local partner CAOA has been producing the Tiggo 4 in An√°polis, Goi√°s, in knock-down kit form, since November 2018.https://revistaautoesporte.globo.com/Noticias/noticia/2018/11/chery- tiggo-4-nacional-sera-lancado-logo-apos-o-salao-do-automovel.html Egypt Speranza Chery A5 Assembly of Chery cars from complete knock- down kits began in Egypt in 2004 according to the company itself, but news reports indicate that it only expressed initial interest in doing so that year. As of 2011, some Chery models may be sold here under the brand name Speranza. One Egyptian factory making Chery models from semi-complete knock- down kits had a 2009 production capacity of 30,000 vehicles/year. In 2011, Chery stated the parts localization ratio for Egypt was 45%. Indonesia In this country, Chery models have been assembled from knock-down kits since 2006. Iran Manufacture from kits in Iran dates from as early as 2004. In late 2007, Chery stated that it held a minority ownership in a joint venture with Iranian Khodro and Canadian Solitac as its partners. This JV controlled a knock-down factory in Babol, Mazandaran. Making a QQ6 renamed the S21, it may be sold both inside and outside Iran. and carry a brand name other than Chery, as well. Tiggo5 and Arrizo5 cars are being sold as Chery brand in Iran. Modiran Vehicle Manufacturing Company also manufactures Chery vehicles in Iran. Malaysia A small facility may have become operational around 2004, and by 2008, a factory assembling Chery models from kits opened in Johor Bahru, Johor.Bursa, M. (2009). \\"ASEAN automotive market review: Management briefing; Manufacturer activity\\". Just-Auto News. Bromsgrove, United Kingdom, Bromsgrove As of 2012, another factory is expected to be built and operational in Malaysia by 2015. Myanmar As of May 2011, a 3,000 to 5,000 unit/year production facility is planned in the country. As of 2012, the Chery QQ is apparently popular in Yangon. Pakistan In 2004, Chery expressed interest in exporting knock-down kits to this country, and at present some assembly may occur. Taiwan The Chery A3 is assembled since August 2009 in Taichung, Taiwan, by Shengrong Auto, a subsidiary of Prince Motors (), a Taiwanese car company. Thailand In 2008, Chery agreed to export kits to this country, and while an assembly factory was supposed to have become operational in 2010, as of late 2011 Xinhua reported that Chery was conducting a \\"feasibility study\\" in regards to \\"moving production to Thailand\\". Turkey A production site was planned to be raised in the province of Sakarya, in a collaboration with the local Chery dealer, Mermerler Otomotiv. Ukraine ZAZ Forza Chery has had a partnership with ZAZ since 2006 and manufactures cars from kits at sites in Zaporizhia and Chornomorsk. Since February 2011, the Chery A13 has been manufactured in Ukraine, where it is rebadged and sold in the country as a ZAZ Forza. Venezuela First introduced to this country in mid-2006, Chery vehicles continued to be the only licensed Chinese car exports to Venezuela as of 2011, according to the company. Opened in September 2011, a new Chery production site in the north- central state of Aragua, owned by the ZGT joint venture, produces the A1 and A3 models. =Former factories= Russia In Russia, Avtotor produced Chery models from kits from 2006 to 2008.http://wardsauto.com/news- analysis/russia-s-tagaz-launches-chery-assembly TagAZ also produced Chery vehicles, from 2008 to 2014, but these usually carried non-Chery badges such as \\"Vortex\\". Uruguay Between 2007 and 2015, the Argentinian company SOCMA Group manufactured Chery vehicles in the Oferol factory in Barra de Carrasco, Canelones, Uruguay. The Tiggo was officially launched in Uruguay in October 2007. The plant was permanently closed as of May 2015.http://www.efe.com/efe/english/business/chery-closes-factory-in-uruguay- on-fall-demand-from-brazil-and-argentina/50000265-2617453 Joint ventures Chery operates car-making joint ventures with Jaguar Land Rover and Israel Corporation, and automotive component-manufacturing joint ventures with Arvin Meritor, Johnson Controls, and PPG Industries. =Chery Jaguar Land Rover= In March 2012, Chery and the UK-based luxury automaker Jaguar Land Rover agreed to invest an initial US$2.78 billion in a new China-based joint venture that will sell and manufacture Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles and engines, as well as establish a research and development facility and create a new \\"own- brand\\" automobile marque. The joint venture received regulatory approval in September 2012. An initial production base will be built in Changshu, a county-level city close to Shanghai. =Qoros= Qoros 3 Its first car-making joint venture with a foreign firm, Qoros was established by Chery in cooperation with Israel Corporation in 2007, and planned to begin sales in 2013. Set to unveil a sedan atop a brand-new platform at the 2013 Shanghai Auto Show, Qoros' debut models will not be electric vehicles (as some sources may have reported). A proposed production base for the venture will be built in Changshu, Jiangsu province, and become operational in 2012. Production capacity will be 150,000 units a year, but the location may not run at full capacity until 2015 or 2016. While Qoros professes its desire to sell to young city dwellers in China and Europe, The company does have plans to include electric vehicles in its lineup. Higher-end Qoros cars are built with components and systems from foreign suppliers such as American Visteon and French Valeo. Its engine design also required assistance from a foreign firm, and Qoros has attracted western talent including former employees of Volkswagen and Mini. It has sites in Austria and Germany as of 2012. Although initially known as Chery Quantum Auto Co Ltd, its legal name is now Qoros Auto Co Ltd. The eponymous brand name sounds like the English word \\"chorus\\". Products and services =Vehicles= From 2009 until around 2013, Chery vehicles sold under four brand names: Chery, Karry, Rely, and Riich. In September 2012, Chery announced the cancellation of the last two brands. Only the Chery (passenger cars) and the Karry brand (for commercial vehicles) are to remain. Chery makes cars, minivans, and SUVs. The parts used in their manufacture may be foreign designed, and some may be imported; Chery has cooperative agreements with many foreign component firms, including the American ArvinMeritor, American Autoliv, American Delphi Automotive, the Australian company Futuris, German Robert Bosch GmbH, American PPG Industries, German Siemens VDO, French Valeo, and the American Visteon. Some have helped Chery establish a local supply chain.

China subsidizes oil (an incentive for the State to encourage use and manufacture of electric cars), and some of its automakers see opportunities in less mature electric vehicles because Western companies have yet to develop much of a lead in the technology. In 2010, Chery signed a memorandum of understanding with the American company Better Place for the development of prototype electric vehicles to be used in pilot projects. =Electric models= In 2009, Chery announced that it had built an all-electric car, the S18. In early 2009, the company showed an all-electric Chery Riich M1 to journalists. This car, also referred to as the S18, may have entered production in 2010. C. 2011, Chery stated that it was investing heavily in research and development of electric cars, and three hybrid as well as two all-electric models were listed on its website as of 2012. Hybrid models may use a start-stop system solely. Sales The Chery Tiggo Chery has been the top Chinese auto exporter since 2003, and many of its exports may be in the form of knock-down kits destined for overseas assembly. The fact that, prior to 2012, it lacked a joint venture with an established western automaker may explain its export focus; a 2009 report by the US Congressional Research Service asserted that such joint ventures, commonplace in the Chinese auto industry, restrained overseas sales. Making its first export to Syria in 2001, as of 2010 Chery was the top exporter among Chinese automakers, a title it held since 2003. Many of these exports may be in the form of knock-down kits. One of Chery's strategic goals is to expand in developing countries first and then in developed countries. Selling in several other continents besides, Chery dealerships exist in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Iran, Serbia, Macedonia, Turkey and Italy through the DR Motor Company.Chery dealerships in Russia, Ukraine , Belarus , Serbia, Macedonia , Turkey and Italy. Other notable nations where Chery models are on offer as of 2016 include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa. In Ukraine, Chery models are sold by UkrAVTO Corp, and partner firms operate sales outlets in other markets as well. In some nations, companies Chery cooperates with build models in their own small factories. As of early 2011, the Tiggo was Chery's most popular model in export markets. Motorsport Chery participated in the Dakar Rally in 2010 and 2011, racing with Rely X5 SUVs in both editions. (2011 Dakar Rally entry list) Safety record An informal, 2007 Russian crash test yielded a poor score for a Chery model named the Amulet. Some Chery models have received good marks for safety, however. In 2009, the A3 received a five-star safety rating in the Chinese new-car-safety tests, C-NCAP, becoming the first indigenous car to achieve such a high-test rating. The Chery Riich G3 has also been awarded a five-star rating. Controversies =Copying claims= In June 2003 American company General Motors sued Chery accusing it of copying the first generation Daewoo Matiz (developed by a GM subsidiary, GM Daewoo) in its design for the Chery QQ. General Motors also claimed a disguised Matiz was used in a crash test in place of the Chery car. GM executives claimed design duplication with many parts interchangeable between the QQ and the Matiz, and GM China Group stated the two vehicles, \\"shared remarkably identical body structure, exterior design, interior design and key components.\\" While some Chery cars are not copies, such as the Pininfarina-designed A3, the QQ may not be the sole Chery model that wears famous-name designs; the Chery Tiggo is criticized for resembling the second generation Toyota RAV4. Other model using the Matiz technology found in the QQ include the closely related QQ6. The Eastar and its derivatives (V4, B12, and B22) have also been considered to be copies of the Daewoo Magnus. GM lawsuit After mediation attempts failed, then-GM Daewoo (now known as GM Korea) brought a case against Chery in a Shanghai court, but by 2005 jurisdiction had been moved to the Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court. Around that time Chinese state officials, including a vice-minister of commerce and a vice-director of the State Intellectual Property Office, publicly supported Chery. The Chinese have claimed that GM didn't properly patent their technology. In late 2005 the lawsuit was settled. =Bricklin U.S. court case= An American entrepreneur with past experience importing developing country autos to the U.S., Malcolm Bricklin, sued Chery in 2008 for contracting a different company after previously contracting Bricklin.

The Internal Revolutionary Organisation () or IRO was a Bulgarian revolutionary organisation founded and built up by Bulgarian revolutionary Vasil Levski in the period between 1869 and 1871. The organisation represented a network of regional revolutionary committees which were governed by a Central Committee in the town of Lovech. The foundation of IRO reflected Levski's ideas that the centre of revolutionary activity be transferred from the Bulgarian emigrant circles in Romania to Bulgaria proper. In 1871, Levski prepared the Charter of the organisation in the spirit of his own political views: liberation of Bulgaria from the Ottomans through a nationwide revolution and establishment of the country as a democratic republic with guarantees for the equality of all of its citizens regardless of their ethnicity or religion. By the end of 1872, both Levski and Lyuben Karavelov, the chairman of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee (BRCC), which was situated in Bucharest, had figured out that the future success of the armed struggle against the Ottomans depended on the co- operation of both: external and internal committees. To this end, the two organisations prepared and adopted a joint programme and charter and voted on the merger of the two organisations under the name of BRCK at a general meeting held in Bucharest in May, 1872. The goals and fundamental principles which governed the work of the Internal Revolutionary Organisation influenced the formation and guiding principles of subsequent Bulgarian revolutionary organisations, namely the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organisation (active in the Ottoman Empire from 1893 to 1912), the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation (active in Greek and Yugoslav Macedonia from 1919 to 1934), the Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation (active in Western Thrace from 1922 to 1934), the Internal Dobrudjan Revolutionary Organisation (active in Dobruja from 1923 to 1940) and the Internal Western Outland Revolutionary Organisation (active in the Western Outlands from 1921 to 1934).

The Ashby Canal passes to the south of the hill. The hill is the site of the deserted medieval village of Anebein. Ambion Hill was long considered to be the site of the Battle of Bosworth Field and is where the Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre is situated. The chronicler Raphael Holinshed wrote in 1577 that Richard III \\"pitched his field on a hill called Anne Beame, refreshed his soldiers and took his rest\\".http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/media/269.pdf p.19 This was taken by the C18th antiquary William Hutton to mean that Ambion Hill was the site of the battle. Hutton's book The Battle of Bosworth Field, published in 1788, was very influential in causing the hill to be accepted as the site of the battle.Peter Foss, The Field of Redemore: The Battle of Bosworth 1485, (Kairos Press, 1998) Leicestershire County Council set up the battlefield visitor centre at what was Ambion Hill Farm, in 1974.http://www.bosworthbattlefield.org.uk/site-history/ The work of Leicester University historian Daniel Williams was used to interpret the battle. Numerous historians challenged the Ambion Hill location for the battle and this led to a large-scale project (from 2005 to 2009) by the Battlefields Trust, headed by Glenn Foard, to attempt to definitively find the true location of the battlefield. It is now accepted that the core of the battlefield lies either side of Fenn Lanes, about two miles south-west of the visitor centre and that Ambion Hill was Richard III's camp on the night before the battle.Glenn Foard & Anne Curry, Bosworth 1485: A Battlefield Rediscovered, (Oxford, Oxbow Books, 2013) The battlefield heritage centre now has a viewing point with the Fenn Lane Farm site and other notable points marked. Ambion Hill remains within the revised registered battlefield. A cairn built in 1813 marks the well from which according to tradition Richard III is said to have drunk prior to the battle.

Politics In political science, empire- building refers to the tendency of countries and nations to coercively acquire resources, land, and economic influence outside their established borders in order to expand their size, power, and wealth. This expansion can be at the cost of those nations or people that have had resources taken away from them so that the conqueror can be enriched. Business In business, empire- building is demonstrated when individuals or small groups attempt to gain control over key projects and initiatives to maximize job security and promotability. Project leadership hoards potential credit and prestige the project can produce. Because this approach prevents other people in the organization from contributing in a meaningful manner and alternative or competing projects to address the project's goals are destroyed regardless of their merit, the company suffers as a whole, projects fail, and the goals of the project are achieved partially, inadequately, or not at all. This sort of behavior is supposed to be stopped by upper management but is nevertheless very common. Organizations In an organization, empire-building can also be demonstrated when an individual or small group eagerly and proactively suggests and pursues functions, activities or projects that are of questionable value to try to enhance legitimacy and future value. Pursuit of these activities is initially done at marginal cost, but later the activities are used to justify increased resource allocation, being part of the organizational status quo, and thus the individual or group's overall command of resources, and influence, increases.

It is headed by Patriarch Youssef Absi, headquartered in Cathedral of Our Lady of the Dormition, Damascus, Syria. The Melkites, Byzantine Rite Catholics, trace their history to the early Christians of Antioch, formerly part of Syria and now in Turkey, of the 1st century AD, where Christianity was introduced by Saint Peter. The Melkite Church is related to the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch. It is mainly centered in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and Palestine. Melkite Greek Catholics are present, however, throughout the world by migration due to persecution. Outside the Near East, the Melkite Church has also grown through intermarriage with, and the conversion of, people of various ethnic heritages as well as transritualism. At present there is a worldwide membership of approximately 1.6 million.Faulk (2007), pp. 9‚Äì10 While the Melkite Catholic Church's Byzantine rite liturgical traditions are shared with those of Eastern Orthodoxy, the Church has officially been part of the Catholic Church since the reaffirmation of its union with the Holy See of Rome in 1724.  Name  Melkite, from the Syriac word malkƒÅ for \\"King\\" and the Arabic word Malakƒ´ (, meaning \\"royal\\", and by extension, \\"imperial\\"), was originally a pejorative term for Middle Eastern Christians who accepted the authority of the Council of Chalcedon (451) and the Byzantine Emperor, a term applied to them by non-Chalcedonians.Dick (2004), p. 9 Of the Chalcedonian churches, Greek Catholics continue to use the term, while Eastern Orthodox do not. The Greek element signifies the Byzantine Rite heritage of the church, the liturgy used by all the Eastern Orthodox Churches.Faulk (2007), p. 5. The term Catholic acknowledges communion with the Church of Rome and implies participation in the universal Christian church. According to Church tradition, the Melkite Church of Antioch is the \\"oldest continuous Christian community in the world\\". In Arabic, the official language of the church, it is called ar-R≈´m al-Kath≈´lƒ´k (). The Arabic word \\"R≈´m\\" means Roman, from the Greek word \\"Romaioi\\" by which the Greek-speaking Eastern (called \\"Byzantine\\" in modern parlance) Romans had continued to identify themselves even when the Roman empire had ceased to exist elsewhere. The name literally means \\"Roman Catholic\\", confusingly for the modern English-speaker, but this does not refer to the Latin-speaking Western Catholic Church of Rome but rather to the Greek- speaking Eastern Orthodox \\"Byzantine\\" Roman heritage, the centre of gravity of which was the city of \\"New Rome\\" (Latin: Nova Roma, Greek: ŒùŒ≠Œ± Œ°œéŒºŒ∑), i.e. Constantinople.  History  According to the Melkite Catholic Church, its origins go back to the establishment of Christianity in the Near East.Tawil (2001), pp. 1‚Äì3 As Christianity began to spread, the disciples preached the Gospel throughout the region and were for the first time recorded to be called \\"Christians\\" in the city of Antioch (Acts 11:26), the historical See of the Melkite Catholic Patriarchate.Dick (2004), pp. 13-15 Scholars attribute the actual writing of the gospels in Koine Greek to the Hellenized Christian population of Antioch, with authors such as St. Luke and others. By the 2nd century, Christianity was widespread in Antioch and throughout Syria. Growth of the church did not stop during periods of persecution, and by the end of the 4th century Christianity became the official state religion. The Melkite Greek Catholic Church traces its origins to the Christian communities of the Levant and Egypt. The church's leadership was vested in the three Apostolic Patriarchates of the ancient patriarchates: Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem. =Fallout of the Fourth Ecumenical Council= Afte4 the Fourth Ecumenical Council, the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, fifth-century Middle-Eastern Christian society became sharply divided between those who did and those who did not accept the outcome of the council. Those who accepted the decrees of the council, the Chalcedonians, were mainly Greek-speaking city-dwellers, and were called Melkites (imperials) by the anti-Chalcedonians‚Äîwho were predominantly Armenian or Coptic-speaking provincials.Tawil (2001), p. 21 =Fusion with Arabic Language and Culture= The Battle of Yarmuk (636) took the Melkite homeland out of Byzantine control and placed it under the occupation of the Arab invaders.Dick (2004), p. 21 Whereas the Greek language and culture remained important, especially for the Melkites of Jerusalem, Antiochene Melkite tradition merged with the Arabic language and culture. Indeed, there was Arabic Christian poetry before the arrival of Islam, but the Antiochene blending with Arabic culture led to a degree of distancing from the Patriarch of Constantinople. Despite the Arab invasion, the Melkites continued to exercise an important role in the Universal Church. The Melkites played a leading role in condemning the iconoclast controversy when it re-appeared in the early 9th century, and were among the first of the Eastern churches to respond to the introduction of the filioque clause in the West.Dick (2004, p. 21 =Communion with the Roman Catholic Church= Pope Pius XI and Patriarch Demetrios I Qadi in 1923 In 1724, Cyril VI Tanas was elected new Patriarch of Antioch. As Cyril was considered to be pro-Western, the Patriarch Jeremias III of Constantinople feared that his authority would be compromised. Therefore, Jeremias declared Cyril's election to be invalid, excommunicated him, and ordained the Greek hierodeacon Sylvester of Antioch as a priest and bishop so as to take Jeremias' place.Parry, (1999), p. 312 Sylvester exacerbated divisions with his heavy-handed rule of the church as many Melkites acknowledged Cyril's claim to the patriarchal throne. Jeremias and Sylvester began a five-year campaign of persecution against Cyril and the Melkite faithful who supported him, enforced by Ottoman Turkish troops. Five years after the election of Cyril VI, in 1729, Pope Benedict XIII recognized him as Patriarch of Antioch and recognized his followers as being in full communion with the Roman Catholic Church. From this time onwards, the Melkite Greek- Catholic Church has existed separately from and in parallel to the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch in Western Asia; the latter is no longer referred to as Melkite. The Melkite Greek Catholic Church has played an important role in the leadership of Arabic Christianity. It has always been led by Arabic- speaking Christians, whereas its Orthodox counterpart had Greek patriarchs until 1899. Indeed, at the very beginning of her separate existence, around 1725, one lay leader, theologian Abdallah Zakher of Aleppo (1684‚Äì1748) set up the first printing press in the Arab world. In 1835, Maximos III Mazloum, Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarch of Antioch, was recognized by the Ottoman Empire as the leader of a millet, a distinctive religious community within the Empire. Pope Gregory XVI gave Maximos III Mazloum the triple-patriarchate of Antioch, Alexandria and Jerusalem, a title that is still held by the leader of the Melkite Catholic Church. =Expansion and participation at the First Vatican Council= Stained glass window at the Annunciation Melkite Catholic Cathedral in Roslindale, Massachusetts depicting Christ enthroned in regalia of a Byzantine emperor In 1847, Pope Pius IX (1846‚Äì1878) reinstituted the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem in the person of the 34-year-old, Giuseppe Valerga (1813‚Äì1872), whom the indigenous hierarchy nicknamed \\"The Butcher\\" because of his fierce opposition to the Eastern Orthodox churches of the Holy Land. When he arrived in Jerusalem in 1847, there were 4,200 Latin Catholics and when he died in 1872, the number had doubled. Under pressure from the Roman curia to adopt Latin Church practices, Patriarch Clement Bahouth introduced the Gregorian calendar used by the Latin and Maronite Churches in 1857; that act caused serious problems within the Melkite church, resulting in a short-lived schism.Dick (2004), p. 38 Conflicts in the Melkite church escalated to the point where Clement abdicated his position as patriarch. Clement's successor, Patriarch Gregory II Youssef (1864‚Äì1897), worked to restore peace within the community, successfully healing the lingering schism. He also focused on improving church institutions. During his reign Gregory founded both the Patriarchal College in Beirut in 1865 and the Patriarchal College in Damascus in 1875 and re-opened the Melkite seminary of Ain Traz in 1866. He also promoted the establishment of Saint Ann's Seminary, Jerusalem, in 1882 by the White Fathers for the training of the Melkite clergy. Following the Hatt-ƒ± H√ºmayun of 1856, decreed by Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I, the situation of Christians in the Near East improved. This allowed Gregory to successfully encourage greater participation by the Melkite laity in both church administration as well as public affairs. Gregory also took an interest in ministering to the growing number of Melkites who had emigrated to the Americas. In 1889 he dispatched Father Ibrahim Beshawate of the Basilian Salvatorian Order in Saida, Lebanon, to New York in order to minister to the growing Syrian community there. According to historian Philip Hitte, Beshawate was the first permanent priest in the United States from the Near East from among the Melkite, Maronite, and Antiochian Orthodox churches. Gregory was also a prominent proponent of Eastern ecclesiology at the First Vatican Council. In the two discourses he gave at the Council on May 19 and June 14, 1870, he insisted on the importance of conforming to the decisions of the Council of Florence, of not creating innovations such as papal infallibility, but accepting what had been decided by common agreement between the Greeks and the Latins at the Council of Florence, especially with regard to the issue of papal primacy.Dick (2004), pp. 109-111 He was keenly aware of the disastrous impact that the dogmatic definition of papal infallibility would have on relations with the Eastern Orthodox Church and emerged as a prominent opponent of the dogma at the Council.Parry (1999), p. 313 He also defended the rights and privileges of the patriarchs according to the canons promulgated by earlier ecumenical councils. Speaking at the Council on May 19, 1870, Patriarch Gregory asserted: > The Eastern Church attributes to the pope the most complete and highest > power, however in a manner where the fullness and primacy are in harmony > with the rights of the patriarchal sees. This is why, in virtue of an > ancient right founded on customs, the Roman Pontiffs did not, except in very > significant cases, exercise over these sees the ordinary and immediate > jurisdiction that we are asked now to define without any exception. This > definition would completely destroy the constitution of the entire Greek > church. That is why my conscience as a pastor refuses to accept this > constitution.Dick (2004), p. 110. Dick notes that his source is C. Patelos, > Vatican 1st et les eveques uniates, Louvain: Nauwelaerts, 1981, 482-283 Patriarch Gregory refused to sign the Council's dogmatic declaration on papal infallibility. He and the seven other Melkite bishops present voted non placet at the general congregation and left Rome prior to the adoption of the dogmatic constitution Pastor Aeternus on papal infallibility.Descy (1993), p. 64 Other members of the anti-infallibilist minority, both from the Latin church and from other Eastern Catholic churches, also left the city. After the First Vatican Council concluded an emissary of the Roman Curia was dispatched to secure the signatures of the patriarch and the Melkite delegation. Patriarch Gregory and the Melkite bishops subscribed to it, but with the qualifying clause as used at the Council of Florence attached: \\"except the rights and privileges of Eastern patriarchs.\\".Zoghby (1998), p.83 He earned the enmity of Pius IX for this; during his next visit to the pontiff Gregory was cast to the floor at Pius' feet by the papal guard while the pope placed his foot on the patriarch's head.Parry (1999), p. 313. See also the account given by Zoghby (1998), p. 83 This story has been cast into doubt by more recent studies of the First Vatican Council. John R. Quinn cites Joseph Hajjar in his book Revered and Reviled: A Re-Examination of Vatican Council 1,: \\"We have been unable to find any document to provide historical verification for such treatment by the Pope.\\" Orthodox historian A. Edward Siecienski reports that the historicity of this story \\"is now deeply suspect.\\" Despite this, Patriarch Gregory and the Melkite Catholic Church remained committed to their union with the Church of Rome. Relationships with the Vatican improved following the death of Pius IX and the subsequent election of Leo XIII as pontiff. Leo's encyclical Orientalium dignitas addressed some of the Eastern Catholic Churches' concerns on latinization and the centralizing tendencies of Rome.Dick (2004), p. 39 Leo also confirmed that the limitations placed on the Armenian Catholic patriarch by Pius IX's 1867 letter Reversurus would not apply to the Melkite Church; further, Leo formally recognized an expansion of Patriarch Gregory's jurisdiction to include all Melkites throughout the Ottoman Empire. =Vatican II conflicts over Latin and Melkite traditions= Patriarch Maximos IV Sayegh took part in the Second Vatican Council where he championed the Eastern tradition of Christianity, and won a great deal of respect from Orthodox observers at the council as well as the approbation of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Athenagoras I. Following the Second Vatican Council the Melkites moved to restoring traditional worship. This involved both the restoration of Melkite practices such as administering the Eucharist to infants following post-baptismal chrismation as well as removal of Latin-rite elements such as communion rails and confessionals. In the pre-conciliar days, the leaders of this trend were members of \\"The Cairo Circle\\", a group of young priests centered on the Patriarchal College in Cairo. This group included Fathers George Selim Hakim, Joseph Tawil, Elias Zoghby, and former Jesuit Oreste Kerame; they later became bishops and participated in the Second Vatican Council, and saw their efforts vindicated. These reforms led to protests by some Melkite churches that the de- latinisation had gone too far. During the Patriarchate of Maximos IV (Sayegh), some Melkites in the United States objected to the use of the vernacular in the celebration of the Divine Liturgy, a movement that was spearheaded by the future archbishop of Nazareth, Father Joseph Raya of Birmingham, Alabama. The issue garnered national news coverage after Bishop Fulton Sheen celebrated a Pontifical Divine Liturgy in English at the Melkite National convention in Birmingham in 1958, parts of which were televised on the national news. =Resolution= In 1960, the issue was resolved by Pope John XXIII at the request of Patriarch Maximos IV in favour of the use of vernacular languages in the celebration of the Divine Liturgy. Pope John also consecrated a Melkite priest, Father Gabriel Acacius Coussa, as a bishop, using the Byzantine Rite and the papal tiara as a crown. Bishop Coussa was almost immediately elevated to the cardinalate, but died two years later. His cause for canonization was introduced by his religious order, the Basilian Alepian Order. Further protests against the de-latinisation of the church occurred during the patriarchate of Maximos V Hakim (1967‚Äì2000) when some church officials who supported Latin traditions protested against allowing the ordination of married men as priests. Today the church sees itself as an authentic Orthodox church in communion with the Roman Catholic Church. As such it has a role as a voice of the East within the western church, a bridge between faiths and peoples. =Attempts to unite the Melkite diaspora= Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarchal Cathedral in Damascus Iconostasis at Saint George Greek-Melkite Church in Sacramento, California Due to heavy emigration from the Eastern Mediterranean, which began with the Damascus massacres of 1860 in which most of the Christian communities were attacked, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church today is found throughout the world and no longer made up exclusively of faithful of Eastern Mediterranean origin. The Patriarchate of Maximos V saw many advances in the worldwide presence of the Melkite Church, called \\"the Diaspora\\": Eparchies (the Eastern equivalent of a diocese) were established in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Argentina and Mexico in response to the continued emptying of the Eastern Mediterranean of her native Christian peoples. Some historians state that after the revolution in Egypt in 1952, many Melkites left Egypt due to the renewed Islamic, nativist and socialist policies of the Nasser regime. In 1950, the richest Melkite community in the world was in Egypt. In 1945 the most populous single diocese was Akko, Haifa, Nazareth and all Galilee. In 1967, a native Egyptian of Syrian-Aleppin descent, George Selim Hakim, was elected the successor of Maximos IV, and took the name Maximos V. He was to reign until he retired at the age of 92 in the Jubilee Year of 2000. He reposed on the feast of Saints Peter and Paul, June 29, 2001. He was succeeded by Archbishop Lutfi Laham, who took the name Gregory III.  Organization  The Melkite Catholic Church is in full communion with the Holy See (the Latin Catholic Pope of Rome and his Roman Congregation for the Eastern Churches), where the Patriarch is represented by his Procurator at Rome, but fully follows the traditions and customs of Byzantine Christianity.Faulk (2007), pp. 5-7 The traditional languages of worship are Arabic and Greek, but today, services are held in a variety of languages, depending on the country where the church is located. The Melkite Synod of Bishops, composed of all of the Church's bishops, meets each year to consider administrative, theological and Church-wide issues.The Melkite Handbook (2008), p. 12 = Patriarchate = The current Patriarch is Joseph Absi who was elected on 21 June 2017. The patriarchate is based in the Syrian capital Damascus, but it formally remains one of the Eastern Catholic Patriarchs claiming the apostolic succession to the Ancient see of Antioch, and has been permanently granted the styles of Titular Patriarch of Alexandria and Jerusalem, two other patriarchates with multiple Catholic succession. The patriarchate is administered by a permanent synod, which includes the Patriarch and four bishops, the ordinary tribunal of the patriarch for legal affairs, the patriarchal economos who serves as financial administrator, and a chancery. = Current (Arch)Dioceses and similar jurisdictions = In the Arab World and Africa, the church has dioceses in : * Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan, where the Patriarch of Antioch has the style of Titular Patriarch of Alexandria : **Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Alexandria, administered by a Patriarchal Vicar or Protosyncellus ** Melkite Catholic Territory Dependent on the Patriarch of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan * The Holy Land, where the Patriarch of Antioch has the style of Titular Patriarch of Jerusalem : **Israel : Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Akka (including Haifa, Nazareth and all Galilee) ** Palestinian territories: Melkite Catholic Territory Dependent on the Patriarch of Jerusalem ** (Trans)Jordan : Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Petra and Philadelphia in Amman and all Transjordan * Iraq : **Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarchal Exarchate of Iraq * Arabian Peninsula : **Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarchal Exarchate of Kuwait * Lebanon : **Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Baalbek **Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Baniyas and Marjeyoun (suffragan of Tyre) **Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Beirut and Byblos (nominally Metropolitan) **Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Sidon and Deir el-Kamar (suffragan of Tyre) **Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Tripoli (suffragan of Tyre) ** Metropolitan Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Tyre (with three Lebanese archiepiscopal suffragans) **Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Zahle and Forzol and all the Bekaa * Syria : **Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Damascus, Patriarchal See of Antioch. **Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Aleppo (nominally Metropolitan) **Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Bosra and Hauran (Archeparchy of Khabab) (nominally metropolitan) **Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Homs (united with titular sees Hama and Yabroud) (nominally metropolitan) **Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Latakia and the Valley of the Christians Throughout the rest of the world, the Melkite Catholic Church has dioceses and exarchates for its diaspora in : * Australia and New Zealand (Oceania) : ** Melkite Greek Catholic Eparchy of Saint Michael Archangel in Sydney * Turkey (Eurasia) : ** Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarchal Exarchate of Istanbul * North America : Porta Coeli Church (now the Melkite Greek Catholic Cathedral of Mexico City) ** Melkite Greek Catholic Eparchy of Saint-Sauveur in Montr√©al (Canada). ** Melkite Greek Catholic Eparchy of Nuestra Se√±ora del Para√≠so in Mexico City (Mexico). ** Melkite Greek Catholic Eparchy of Newton (United States of America) * South America : **Melkite Greek Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Argentina ** Melkite Greek Catholic Eparchy of Nossa Senhora do Para√≠so em S√£o Paulo ( Brazil, suffragan of the Latin Metropolitan of S√£o Paulo) ** Melkite Greek Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Venezuela, Caracas Furthermore, one of the Ordinaries is appointed Apostolic visitor for the countries without proper ordinariate in Western Europe, while in some countries the Melkite diaspora is served pastorally by Ordinariates for all the Byzantine Rites or ‚Äì for all Eastern Catholics. = Titular sees = * Four Metropolitan Titular archbishoprics: Apamea in Syria, Cesarea in Pal√¶stina, Edessa in Osrho√´ne, Pelusium * Six other Titular archbishoprics: Adana, Cesarea in Cappadocia, Damiata, Hama (united with current Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Homs), Hierapolis in Syria, Myra, Tarsus * Two Episcopal Titular bishoprics: Jabrud (united with current Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Homs), Laodicea in Syria, Palmyra = Religious institutes (regular orders) = * Basilian Aleppian Order * Basilian Chouerite Order * Basilian Salvatorian Order * Melkite Paulists (fr) = Other = There are also several patriarchal organizations with offices and chapters throughout the world, including: * the Global Melkite Association, a group which networks eparchies, monasteries, schools and Melkite associations * Friends of The Holy Land, a lay charitable organization active in the diaspora which provides clothing, medicine and liturgical items for churches and communities in the Holy Land (Israel, Palestine, Jordan), Lebanon, Egypt, and Syria.

Television and feature film career Greenwald moved to Los Angeles in 1972, where he continued working as a theater director at the Mark Taper Forum. He later launched a career as a director for television, establishing first Moonlight Productions and then Robert Greenwald Productions (RGP), and began creating theatrical films, television movies, miniseries and documentaries with a distinct social and political sensibility. Moonlight Productions was responsible for 34 films, and RGP has brought more than 45 films to audiences worldwide. In 1977, Greenwald received his first of three Emmy Award nominations for producing the television movie 21 Hours at Munich about the massacre at the 1972 Olympics. His next Emmy nomination came in 1984 for directing The Burning Bed, one of the most-watched television movies of all time. Based on a true story, The Burning Bed has been credited as \\"a turning point in the fight against domestic violence.\\" Greenwald also directed theatrical films such as Breaking Up (1997), Steal This Movie! (2000) and Xanadu (1980). Xanadu received mostly negative reviews. The film barely broke even at the box office in its initial release. A double feature of Xanadu and another musical released at about the same time, Can't Stop the Music, inspired John J. B.

At Brave New Films, Greenwald has produced and directed numerous feature- length documentaries, along with many short films and videos.

Following the release of 16 Women and Donald Trump, which featured women who publicly accused President Trump of sexual misconduct, Greenwald hosted three of the accusers at a December, 2017 press conference in New York. Distribution and impact Typically Greenwald's approach has been to adapt the principles of guerrilla filmmaking to political documentaries, using small budgets and short shooting schedules to produce films and then distributing them on DVDs or the Internet in affiliation with politically sympathetic groups such as MoveOn.org. BNF's methods are \\"rewriting the book on how movies are made and distributed.\\" Greenwald's innovative model is said to be \\"working magnificently\\": \\"Millions of viewers have seen BNF films via grassroots 'house parties' and independent online DVD sales\\", as well as in more traditional theater screenings and online. As a pioneer in alternative methods for effective progressive political campaigns, Greenwald has eschewed traditional distribution models of studio and network releases. He was among the first to post political online shorts and viral videos on YouTube and elsewhere on the internet, as well as releasing full-length documentaries online in a series of ‚Äúreal time‚Äù chapters. Greenwald's group takes full advantage of a variety of media outlets, such as Facebook and Twitter, and harnesses new distribution channels as soon as they emerge. This approach has \\"inspired hundreds of thousands of people to take action and forced pressing issues into the mainstream media.\\" He has been called \\"one of the most prominent and influential voices in new media.\\" According to a Brave New Films website, its documentaries \\"have been streamed across all 7 continents and have been viewed over 70 million times.\\" Politics Various sources have described Greenwald's political activism as left-wing.

Melkites view themselves as the first Christian community, dating the Melkite Church back to the time of the Apostles. This first community is said to have been a mixed one made up of individuals who were Greek, Roman, Syriac, and Jewish. Hellenistic Judaism and the Judeo-Greek \\"wisdom\\" literature popular in the late Second Temple era amongst both Hellenized Jews (known as Mityavnim) and gentile Greek proselyte converts to Judaism played an important part in the formation of the Melkite tradition. After the Islamic conquests of the Levant in the 7th century, the Melkite community started incorporating Arabic language in the liturgical traditions as the Middle East became gradually Arabized. 11th-century Melchite Hirmologion written in Syriac Sert√¢ book script, from Saint Catherine's Monastery, Mount Sinai, now part of the Sch√∏yen Collection. The term Melkite was originally used as a pejorative term after the acrimonious division that occurred in Eastern Christianity after the Council of Chalcedon (451). It was used by non-Chalcedonians to refer to those who backed the council and the Byzantine Emperor (malko and its cognates are Semitic words for \\"king\\"). The Melkites were generally Greek-speaking city-dwellers living in the west of the Levant and in Egypt, as opposed to the more provincial Syriac- and Coptic- speaking non-Chalcedonians. The Melkite Church was organised into three historic patriarchates‚ÄîAlexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem‚Äîin union with the Patriarch of Constantinople. After the Council of Chalcedon, over the ensuing centuries those Churches which rejected this council recognised different patriarchs in Alexandria (Coptic Orthodox Church) and Antioch (Syriac Orthodox Church). The Nubian kingdom of Makuria (in modern Sudan) in contrast to their Non-Chalcedonian Ethiopian Orthodox neighbours, was also Chalcedonian, from c. 575 until c. 710 and still had a large Melkite minority until the 15th century. From 1342, Roman Catholic clergy were based in Damascus and other areas, and worked toward a union between Rome and the Orthodox. At that time, the nature of the East-West Schism, normally dated to 1054, was undefined, and many of those who continued to worship and work within the Melkite Church became identified as a pro-Western party. In 1724, Cyril VI (Seraphim Tanas) was elected in Damascus by the Synod as Patriarch of Antioch. Considering this to be a Catholic takeover attempt, Jeremias III of Constantinople imposed a deacon, the Greek monk Sylvester to rule the patriarchate instead of Cyril. After being ordained a priest, then bishop, he was given Turkish protection to overthrow Cyril. Sylvester's heavy-handed leadership of the church encouraged many to re-examine the validity of Cyril's claim to the patriarchal throne. The newly elected Pope Benedict XIII (1724‚Äì1730) also recognised the legitimacy of Cyril's claim and recognized him and his followers as being in communion with Rome. From that point onwards, the Melkite Church was divided between the Greek Orthodox (Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch), who continued to be appointed by the authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople until the late 19th century, and the Greek Catholics (Melkite Greek Catholic Church), who recognize the authority of the Pope of Rome. However, it is now only the Catholic group who continue to use the title Melkite; thus, in modern usage, the term applies almost exclusively to the Arabic-speaking Greek Catholics from the Middle East. Some typically Grecian \\"Ancient Synagogal\\" priestly rites and hymns have survived partially to the present, notably in the distinct church services of the Melkite and Greek Orthodox communities of the Hatay Province of Southern Turkey, Syria and Lebanon. Members of these communities still call themselves R√ªm which literally means \\"Roman\\" in Arabic (that is, those of the (Eastern) Roman Empire, what English speakers often call \\"Byzantine\\"). The term \\"R√ªm\\" is used in preference to \\"Ionani\\" or \\"YƒÅvƒÅni\\" which means \\"Greek\\" or Ionian in Classical Arabic and Biblical Hebrew.

He graduated in 1895 from Michigan State Agricultural College, currently called Michigan State University; completed M.S., in 1898, from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, 1898; and was awarded Ph.D. by Cornell University in 1900. He taught in elementary schools before becoming (1908) professor of education at the University of Illinois, where he served as the director of the School of Education from 1908 until 1917. He was professor of education at Teachers College, Columbia, from 1917 to 1940. An opponent of pragmatism and progressive education, Bagley insisted on the value of knowledge for its own sake, not merely as an instrument, and he criticized his colleagues for their failure to emphasize systematic study of academic subjects. Of his many works, Education and Emergent Man (1934) contains the clearest exposition of his educational philosophy. His other writings include: *The Educative Process (1905). *Education and Utility (1909). *Educational Values (1911). * (1911). *School Discipline (1914). *History of the American People (1923, co-authored with Charles A.

Galoob licensed the idea behind Micro Machines from Clemens V. Hedeen & Patti Jo Hedeen, American toy inventors from Wisconsin. Micro Machines were tiny scale component style \\"playsets\\" and vehicles that were slightly larger than N scale. Early Micro Machines television commercials were famous for featuring actor John Moschitta Jr., who was (at the time) listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's fastest talker. The toys Many different styles of Micros were made including all the popular cars and trucks of the times, trains, emergency vehicles, tanks, boats, airplanes, helicopters, and motorcycles. The Tuff Trax series contained many of the popular TNT Motorsports Monster Trucks, including the influential Grave Digger truck. Star Trek and Star Wars models were also made, as were models from other science fiction franchises including Babylon 5, Power Rangers and MIB. James Bond and Indiana Jones themed toys were also released. After being bought by Hasbro, Winner's Circle NASCAR and G.I. Joe themed cars and playsets were added. While the Micro Machines collection was known primarily for sizing down automobiles, it also featured several playsets including 1991's fold-out Super Van City. Licensed character products would often be fold-open heads including miniature characters and vehicles interactive with their playset environment. Micro Machines also utilized several diverse features such as color-changing cars and \\"Private Eyes\\" vehicles that even allowed one to peek inside and view an illustration of the contents. One of the many Micro Machines product lines was the Insiders series. Incredibly popular in the late 80s and early 90s, the Insiders series featured a small vehicle inside the standard size Micro Machine. The body and chassis of the larger vehicle connected via a hinge. Opening the larger revealed the smaller, which was a different model of car. Micro Machines released a special Presidential Limousine series, which used President Harry Truman's 1950 Lincoln Cosmopolitan Bubble top limousine. President John F. Kennedy's Lincoln Continental or the X-100 convertible limousine, and President James Earl Carter's 1977 Lincoln Town Car was featured in series done in 1989. For 3 to 4 years Micro Machines was the largest selling toy car line in the US with total dollar sales exceeding the combined sales of the next top-selling lines: Hot Wheels, Matchbox and Majorette. Micro Machines had a well-known advertising campaign in the 1980s involving fast-talker John Moschitta Jr.. The commercials featured pitches in his trademark speedy style and ended with the slogan \\"If it doesn't say Micro Machines, it's not the real thing!\\". In the 1990s, transforming playsets were released. Some could transform from one playset to another, such as a factory to a test track. Others could transform from giant vehicles to playsets, such as a 6x6 to a jungle. Earlier ones included one that could transform from a toolbox to a city. Another innovative release was a line of special boats in the 1990s. While past boats had merely sunk and were not intended for water use, these new sets could actually float. A popular playset from the 1990s When sold to Hasbro, the basic line was largely discontinued, and new packaging of the toys didn't catch on as well as hoped, though some imitators continue to be sold in toy stores. In 2006, the brand name was visible only in the detail panel of the Star Wars and Transformers Titanium series die-cast vehicles and figures. Collectors Interest in collecting Micro Machines has not reached the level of interest in collecting Hot Wheels. One possible reason is that toys are too new; not enough time has passed for collectors to develop an interest. Another reason is that one had to buy a pack at a time and typically only one would be a new model in any given year. Most sets are worth less than the $5 retail, though some like Civil War can command over $10, and the Aliens set of three are on eBay stores for $50. The rare US version of the action fleet Aliens dropship has been asking over $70. Some rare Star Trek sets and ships are being sold for $100 to $370 online. Some of the hardest to find packages of cars have commanded prices around $100. Those packages often contain prototypes never released to the public. Often large lots can be had for pennies per vehicle. Micro Machines kept sealed in the package take up a lot of space, so many collectors store them in other containers. Some collectors use one of the original showcases for Micro Machines while other store their collections in fishing tackle boxes. Some individual cars such as the SVO Mustang have changed hands for over $25 in the early 2000s, though with the appearance of traders who have nearly every vehicle for sale all the time, it is uncommon to see values over $5 for any one vehicle. However, there are some rare models that continue to trade at high values, such as the collector #CE3R Corvette from 1999. Some military vehicles are remarkably valuable models: those made with accurate markings or Soviet equipment such as the T-80BV. Rarer collections such as Star Trek or Star Wars are also valuable. A solid gold Star Trek model that was a grand prize in a drawing sold for over $5,000. Cars can be identified by the name Galoob on the undercarriage. Popular culture Micro Machines were featured in the 1990 Christmas movie Home Alone, starring Macaulay Culkin. In the movie, Culkin's character sets dozens of Micro Machines at the bottom of a flight of stairs as a hazard for a pair of bungling burglars. This trap was also featured in the Sega Genesis game, though it's referred to generically as \\"Toys\\". Revivals =First revival= The Micro Machines brand was revived for a few years in response to the popularity of the similar Speedeez brand. Hasbro also opted to use many fantasy castings in the revival. The revival only lasted a couple of years. The brand 'Micro Machines' has also been incorporated into the packaging of the popular 'Star Wars: Titanium Series' 3-inch vehicle range. The Micro Mayhem is a stop-motion animation, in which the characters are played by Micro Machines.Micro Mayhem: Crazy car chase on the sand table =Second revival= With the release of the movie Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens, Hasbro released a new set of themed Micro Machines. This second revival lasted only a year; no more sets were released after Rogue One. = Third revival = At the 2020 New York Fair, new Micro Machines were announced and are available in stores as of August 2020. Sets include Muscle Cars, Farm, Racing, Construction, and Off-Road, and an updated version of the Super Van City is available as well.  History  The idea for Micro Machines was conceived by Clemens V. Hedeen, Jr and Patti Jo Hedeen in their toy shop of Fun City USA in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin shortly after they got into the toy business. The inventors talked with someone from Galoob at Toy Fair who said they wanted to develop a new, reasonably priced car line. Work was done with their model maker/designer, to prepare 24 micro cars and packaging. The first and only company that the Hedeen‚Äôs sent prototypes to was Galoob. They loved it and wanted to go to contract immediately. Saul Jodell and David Galoob were the masterminds behind marketing Micro Machines. Their vision at Galoob drove Micro Machines to become best-selling toys. Micro Machines thrived for years until Hasbro bought Galoob and Micro Machines for their Star Wars line and eventually put the line on the shelf. Micro Machines have been released periodically since then, but have had limited success since their original release. Patti Jo Hedeen no longer invents toys. Clemens Hedeen still works on toy inventions, with his now wife Kay Hedeen at FunCity USA.

After going 2‚Äì0 with 10.1 scoreless innings for Oakland in 2006 Spring Training, Cruz was dealt to the Arizona Diamondbacks for pitcher Brad Halsey.

Cruz pitched in four scoreless outings for the D'backs in the spring after being traded. Cruz began the year in the starting rotation, and went 3‚Äì3 with a 4.05 ERA and 41 K's in 14 games, before being placed on the day-to-day disabled list with shoulder soreness on June 6. Two days later, he was moved to the 15-day DL. Cruz bounced between the bullpen and the rotation in 2006, but was used strictly out of the bullpen in 2007. He was on the disabled list for about three weeks from late-April to early-May 2007. =Kansas City Royals= On February 28, 2009, the Kansas City Royals signed Cruz to a two-year, $5.5 million contract with a club option for the 2011 season.

Although these long streets extend beyond the bounds of North Lawndale, and West Garfield Park, published sources identify the name K-Town as referring specifically to an area of North Lawndale, and West Garfield Park, i.e. the area through which these streets pass. between Pulaski Road and Cicero Avenue in which the names of many north-south avenues begin with the letter K (Keystone, Karlov, Kedvale, Keeler, Kenneth, Kilbourn, Kildare, Kolin, Kolmar, Komensky, Kostner, Kilpatrick, Kenton, Knox, and Keating). The pattern is a historical relic of a 1913 street-naming proposal, by which streets were to be systematically named according to their distance from the Illinois-Indiana border; K, the eleventh letter, was to be assigned to streets within the eleventh mile, counting west from the state line. The eleventh mile is the easternmost area in which the plan was widely implemented, as many neighborhoods to the east were already developed and had street names in place. The portion of K-Town bounded by W. Kinzie St, W. Cermak Rd, S. Kostner Ave, and S. Pulaski Rd was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places on September 9, 2010.

It began in 1992 with the film Buffy the Vampire Slayer, written by Joss Whedon and directed by Fran Rubel Kuzui, and was resurrected as the television series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer in 1997. The show's popularity caused it to spawn a multitude of Expanded Universe tie-in material such as comic books, novels, and video games, as well as a spin-off program entitled Angel. In 2007, four years after the television series' seventh and final season, Buffy the Vampire Slayer was officially continued in the comic book Season Eight. The following is a list of minor recurring characters who appear in the franchise. A =Aluwyn= (a.k.a. Saga Vasuki) =Amanda= Amanda is a Potential Slayer who appears in Season Seven, played by Sarah Hagan. A Sunnydale High student and member of the swing choir, she first appears in the episode \\"Help\\" as part of the seemingly-random stream of students showing up at Buffy's guidance office. Amanda was sent to Buffy for beating up another student who was picking on her. In the later episode \\"Potential\\", it is revealed that Amanda is in fact a Potential Slayer, and she aptly slays a vampire who threatens her and Dawn. Afterwards, Amanda moves into the Summers' residence, where she trains and becomes friends with her fellow Potentials. In the final episode of the show, \\"Chosen\\", Amanda is activated as a Slayer along with the other Potentials and battles against an army of Turok-Han vampires. She is last seen falling to the ground, apparently dead after her neck was snapped by a Turok-Han. She was the first Potential to kill a vampire and the first one to kill a Turok-Han. =Amy Madison= Amy Madison is a recurring character who appears in all the seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer except Season Five. She was played by Elizabeth Anne Allen. A classmate of Buffy's and Willow's at Sunnydale High School, in the Season One episode \\"Witch\\", it initially appears that Amy is being forced by Catherine Madison, her insane and abusive mother, to try out for the cheerleading squad despite her skills being noticeably weaker than those of the others auditioning. She is distraught when she fails to make the squad, being only the third alternate. Throughout the episode, the cheerleaders fall victim to evil, disfiguring spells cast by Amy, to disable enough members of the squad to get Amy onto it (including Buffy, whom she attempts to murder). However, it turns out that \\"Amy\\" is in fact her mother, Catherine, a powerful witch who has used magic to perform a body swap on herself and Amy so that Catherine can relive her teenage years, where she was a talented and popular cheerleader. Buffy, Giles, and the Scooby Gang combine forces to defeat her. When a spell Catherine/Amy cast against the Slayer backfires, Amy's spirit is restored to her own body and Catherine's spirit is trapped in a cheerleading trophy she had won in the 1970s (shown in Sunnydale High's trophy case). Amy appears again in Seasons Two and Three as a Sunnydale High School student. Aware that Amy has inherited magical power through her mother and has become a practicing witch (after seeing her use magic to deceive a teacher into thinking she has submitted her homework when in fact she has not), Xander Harris asks her to cast a spell to make Cordelia fall in love with him in the episode \\"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered\\" with humorous and potentially disastrous results. In the episode \\"Gingerbread\\", the town goes on a demon-induced, anti-witchcraft spree. To escape being burned at the stake, Amy uses a transformation spell to turn herself into a rat. Unfortunately, once she is in rat form, she cannot recite the spell to transform back (although some sources, for example 'The Buffy Monster Book', report that Amy's actual intention was to turn the townsfolk into rats and the spell ended up backfiring). Willow captures her and keeps her in a cage while she researches how to turn her back into a human being. Only Buffy and Oz are aware that Willow's new pet is a transformed human, with Willow referring to her as \\"Amy-Rat\\". When Buffy and Willow go off to UC- Sunndyale, Amy-Rat goes with them. As a result of Willow's will becoming a magic medium through which any wish of hers instantly comes true in the Season Four episode \\"Something Blue\\", Amy is very briefly turned back into a human‚Äîand moments later, back into a rat. Willow is unaware of the transformation she accomplished. In Season Six, after much research, a much more powerful Willow casts a spell and Amy is made human once more. Amy repays Willow by introducing her to the warlock Rack and abetting Rack in addicting Willow to dark magic. Later, when Willow decides to give up magic entirely, Amy casts a spell on her, causing her to magically manipulate everything she touches. Willow complains that Amy's actions are encumbering her attempts to quit magic. Amy responds by mocking her, implying that she put the hex on Willow as revenge for being trapped in rat form for years because Willow was not assiduous enough in finding a spell to turn her back into a human. As a result, Willow cuts Amy out of her life entirely. Amy makes a final television appearance in the Season Seven episode \\"The Killer in Me\\" in which she again bewitches Willow, this time to cause her to appear as (and ultimately start to become) Warren Mears. She is not seen again in the TV series after this but no mention is ever made of her death, and it is presumed she most likely survived the destruction of Sunnydale by leaving beforehand along with the rest of the town's population. The character has appeared in the comic book series Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight and Season Ten. She has become an opponent of the Slayer and her support organization headed up by Xander Harris, and appears to be using her magical skills for evil ends. In the Buffy season 4 finale Restless, the character of Amy was originally slated to appear as part of a larger ensemble cast for the episode, which would have also seen the return of the characters of Faith Lehane, Cordelia Chase, Angel, Jenny Calendar, and Larry Blaisdell. Due to various scheduling issues none of the six planned characters were able to appear in the episode, their roles either being assigned to other characters or otherwise written out. Had the character of Amy appeared it would have marked her fifth appearance in the series, and the first time that the character would have appeared in more than one episode per season. =Anne= Anne (first appearing as \\"Chanterelle\\", appearing again after changing her name to \\"Lily\\" then Anne) is a recurring character initially appearing in two episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and later crossing over into three episodes of Angel, portrayed by Julia Lee. Initially known as \\"Chanterelle\\", she first appears in the Buffy Season Two episode \\"Lie to Me\\" as a member of the Sunset Club, a naive cult that worships vampires. Chanterelle discovers the true nature of vampires when the club is raided by Spike's bloodthirsty gang, and her life is saved by Buffy Summers. The character reappears in the Season Three episode \\"Anne\\", now named \\"Lily\\" and in love with a boy called Rickie. Buffy is working as a waitress at a diner under her middle name, \\"Anne\\", after running away to Los Angeles. Lily explains to Buffy that she always changes her identity and persona as she moves from place to place, admitting that she was born \\"Joan Appleby\\" and had briefly gone by the name \\"Sister Sunshine\\". When Rickie is killed by a group of demons, Buffy and Lily are taken to a hell dimension where humans are worked as slaves. Lily helps Buffy defeat the demons, and afterward Buffy goes home, leaving her job, apartment, and identity as \\"Anne\\" to Lily. She is not seen again until Season Two of Angel, where she becomes a recurring character by the full name Anne Steele. The gives the character the rare distinction of being one of few, not counting main cast characters, to appear at least once in both an episode of Buffy and an episode of Angel. Anne is also the name of Spike's mother, portrayed by Caroline Lagerfelt. Spike's mother is an elderly upper-class woman in England. She and Spike have a close relationship, and Anne used to sing the folk song \\"Early One Morning\\" to Spike. A flashback in \\"Lies My Parents Told Me\\" reveals that Spike, newly sired by Drusilla, turned his mother into a vampire so they could continue through life together. However, the now soul-less Anne is not the loving mother Spike knew; she attempts to seduce Spike, at which point he dusts her. B =Ben= Ben appears in Season Five, played by Charlie Weber. A handsome intern, he meets and befriends Buffy at the Sunnydale Hospital during her mother's illness, and unsuccessfully attempts to romance her. Unknown to Buffy, Ben is the mortal prison for deposed hell-goddess Glorificus, who has learned to free herself from Ben for periods of time, in order to search for the Key, before transforming back into Ben (a spell prevents any human witnessing or hearing of this transformation from remembering it). Until his personality begins to merge with Glory's in the season's final episodes, he is presented as an essentially decent and compassionate person, protecting Dawn Summers from Glory when he learns that Dawn is the \\"Key\\". In early episodes, Ben appears as a new potential love interest for Buffy, but in a show of personal resolve (and in accordance with the writers' decision that her sister Dawn would be her main \\"love interest\\" in Season Five), Buffy decides to focus on her family issues and not pursue him. As Glory spends more time in control of their shared body, Ben's life starts to fall apart; he is dismissed from his job at Sunnydale Hospital because of increased time (as Glory) spent away from work. In the season's climax, as their personalities begin to merge, Ben agrees, out of self-preservation, to help Glory kill Dawn. When Glory is beaten, she transforms to Ben one final time, only to be smothered to death by Giles, who considers Ben for the most part an innocent but is determined to prevent him from ever returning as Glory to exact revenge on Buffy. =Buffybot= The Buffybot appears in Seasons Five and Six. It is an identical robot replica of the real Buffy Summers and is also played by Sarah Michelle Gellar. Though it is a perfect physical likeness of Buffy and has complete knowledge of Buffy's friends and family, the Buffybot's mannerisms and speech patterns are stilted and imperfect by human standards. It also lacks understanding of nuance and tact, and can be disconcertingly blunt in conversation. The Buffybot first appears in the episode \\"Intervention\\", having been created by Warren Mears as a sex toy for the vampire Spike, who is obsessed with Buffy. Therefore, the Buffybot is initially programmed to be in love with Spike and will do anything to please him. Buffy's friends mistake the robot for her, assuming that Buffy's grief over her mother's death has driven her insane, and Buffy later poses as the Buffybot to find out whether Spike betrayed her and Dawn to the hellgod Glory, rewarding him with a kiss when she learns that he endured torture to protect them. In the Season Five finale, \\"The Gift\\", Xander and Anya find the deactivated Buffybot in the basement of The Magic Box; Willow repairs it and it makes the first strike against Glory, distracting her from the real Buffy. After a few minutes of battle, the Bot is decapitated by Glory and the real Buffy then reveals herself. After Buffy's death in \\"The Gift\\", Willow repairs and reprograms the Buffybot to impersonate her, to keep the demon world unaware ‚Äì for as long as possible ‚Äì that the Slayer no longer defends Sunnydale. The Buffybot's original programming occasionally resurfaces, which both pains and irritates Spike. The impersonation also ensures that Dawn, lacking a legal guardian in Sunnydale with both Buffy and their mother dead, can stay in town with the Scooby Gang, and the group can continue to use the Summers home as their base. In \\"Bargaining\\", one vampire discovers the secret when fighting with it; when he reveals this to a demon biker gang, they invade and sack Sunnydale. The demons destroy the Buffybot by tearing it limb from limb with motorcycles. Before \\"dying\\", the Buffybot reveals to Dawn that the real Buffy has returned from the dead. C =Caridad= Caridad, played by Dania Ramirez, is a Potential Slayer who comes to Sunnydale in Season Seven. First seen in the episode \\"Dirty Girls\\", she plays a small role in the final episodes of Season Seven. In \\"Touched\\", she aids Giles and Kennedy in luring out and capturing a Bringer, and then later follows Faith alongside numerous Potentials to an underground arsenal of The First. She is then seen in the following episode \\"End of Days\\", at first helping those wounded from the bomb blast escape the sewers and then later at the Summers residence, helping heal the wounded and briefly quizzing Buffy on whether her return to the fold is permanent. =Cassie Newton= Cassie Newton is a Sunnydale High student with a precognitive ability who appears in Season Seven, played by Azura Skye. She is a shy blogger, the daughter of divorced parents, and describes herself as looking forward to the school dance. In the episode \\"Help\\", Cassie comes to Buffy's guidance office and predicts her own death on the next Friday Though she remains sadly adamant her fate can't be averted, Buffy and her friends become determined to save her, even when any leads to what could cause her demise turn up false. Buffy eventually saves her from a group of boys who try to kill her in order to raise a demon. Moments later, Buffy saves Cassie from a lethal booby trap. It seems fate has been cheated, but immediately afterward, Cassie dies of a heart attack caused by a hereditary condition of which she had been kept unaware, fulfilling her own prophecy. Buffy's encounter with Cassie made her realize that, regardless of her victories in battle, she cannot avert fate. Cassie tells Buffy that she will make a difference in the upcoming battles with The First Evil, and tells Spike that Buffy will reciprocate his affections for her. Later, Cassie's spirit apparently appears to Willow in \\"Conversations with Dead People\\" and tells her that she has a message from Tara: that she must commit suicide to avoid killing all her friends. When Willow realizes that this \\"girl\\" is not who she says she is, \\"Cassie\\" reveals herself to be The First Evil and tells Willow that it is going for a big finish, before disappearing. =Chao-Ahn= Chao-Ahn, played by Kristy Wu, is a Potential Slayer who comes to Sunnydale in Season Seven. Speaking only Cantonese, she first appears in the episode \\"First Date\\". Most of her subtitled lines serve as comic relief along with the attempts of Giles to communicate with her using crudely drawn and often frightening pictures. Chao-Ahn often mistakes Giles' attempts at communication as personal threats. For instance, she is lactose-intolerant, and various characters keep offering her milk. She is seen on the school bus escaping the destruction of Sunnydale at the end of the series, having survived the battle against the Turok-Han. Chao-Ahn is mistakenly mentioned in the non-canon novel Queen of the Slayers as having died in the battle. =Chloe= Chloe is a Potential Slayer who comes to Sunnydale in Season Seven, and is played by Lalaine. Introduced in the episode \\"Showtime\\", Chloe seems reluctant to engage in her newfound responsibilities, and by her next and final appearance in \\"Get It Done\\", it is clear that Chloe is not cut out for life as a Slayer. Chloe was absent from the episode \\"Potential\\" because she went with Giles to get Chao-Ahn in Shanghai. The First manifests in her room and convinces her to hang herself. Buffy buries Chloe's body next to that of the recently deceased Annabelle. Chloe's suicide is a major catalyst in Buffy's choice to take drastic action, culminating in her meeting with the men who created the First Slayer. It is mentioned that Chloe loved Winnie-the-Pooh after the First assumed her form and said \\"T.T.F.N.\\" ('ta-ta for now'), a signature phrase of the Disney version of Tigger. =Clem= Clem (full name Clement) is a relatively benign demon who appears in Seasons Six and Seven, played by James C. Leary. Clem has large, floppy ears, loose skin, and a friendly disposition, despite being a demon who eats kittens, something that he later stops doing for health and moral reasons. His caucasian coloration allows him to occasionally pass as a human with a \\"skin condition\\". He is Spike's friend and poker buddy. He is introduced in the episode \\"Life Serial\\", as a player in a game of poker where live kittens are the stakes; he is seen cheating by hiding cards in his forearms' skin folds. He reappears in the episodes \\"Older and Far Away\\", in which Spike invites him to Buffy's birthday party, and \\"Hell's Bells\\", in which he attends the wedding of Xander and Anya. Later in the season, he befriends Dawn while looking after her in Spike's absence. The following season, Clem meets Buffy in a demon bar and they greet one another very affectionately. Clem has the ability to project snake-like appendages; he did this trick, frightening Potential Slayers in the episode \\"Potential\\", but it was shown onscreen only from the back of his head. In the episode \\"Empty Places\\", Clem joins the rest of the Sunnydale population in fleeing the town as the apocalypse nears, inviting Buffy to join him. He later reappears in the comic \\"Harmonic Divergence\\" (2009) as part of Harmony Kendall's hit reality show Harmony Bites, which has revealed the existence of vampires to the entire world and also doubles as a media smear campaign against the Scooby Gang and the Slayers themselves. Clem and Harmony subsequently feature in the Angel & Faith story \\"In Perfect Harmony\\" (2012). The pair have moved to London in pursuit of Harmony's reality TV career. She believes she is being blackmailed, though it transpires Clem has engineered it to create a situation where he can be a hero in the hopes she will love him back. She coldly rebuffs his affections but instead offers him a pay rise. In Buffy season 10 as the Scoobies are in charge of rewriting the rules of magic in the world with the Vampyr book, Clem visits them with Harmony as she represents the older type of vampires. Getting their hands on the book Harmony wants Clem to write her as loved by all in the world, though Clem does not do this as the book often twists things to hurt whoever they involve. Spike retrieves the book and discovers Clem did write one change in the world for Harmony: \\"Unicorns are totally real.\\" =Cordettes= The Cordettes were a fashionable clique led by Cordelia Chase when she attended Sunnydale High School. It consisted of the wealthiest and most popular girls in school; Angel later described them as \\"like the Soviet Police, if [the aforementioned organisation] had cared a lot about shoes.\\" Aside from Cordelia, its known members were Harmony Kendall, Aura and Aphrodesia. After Cordelia began dating Xander Harris, whom they considered their inferior, the Cordettes shunned her and Harmony became their leader. During her senior year of school, after being cheated on and hurt by Xander, a heart-broken Cordelia tried to fall back in with her former crew, only to be abused and tormented by them. Contact among the group ended after graduation, as the girls attended separate colleges, Harmony was transformed into a vampire, and the now-penniless Cordelia was forced to abandon college and move to Los Angeles to pursue a fruitless career in acting. D =Dalton= Dalton is a scholarly, bespectacled vampire who appears twice in Season Two, played by Eric Saiet. Spike and Drusilla commandeer Dalton's relative expertise to research a mystical cure for Dru. He translates a stolen book with the use of the \\"Du Lac cross\\", and discovers the ritual that will cure Drusilla (\\"What's My Line, Part One\\"). Several weeks later (\\"Surprise\\"), Dalton brings a mysterious package to Spike (now wheelchair-bound) and Dru (now cured and returned to her full power). The box contains a dismembered piece of the Judge, a powerful demon who cannot be killed and who instantly reassembles when all his pieces are brought together. When the Judge (who kills living things by absorbing the humanity within them) is finally re- formed, he points to Dalton and says, \\"This one‚Äîis full of feeling. He reads!\\" Apparently, this is enough to constitute a \\"taint\\" of humanity, and the Judge burns Dalton to ash. =Deputy Mayor Allan Finch= Allan Finch was the Deputy Mayor of Sunnydale in Season Three, and was played by Jack Plotnick. He is assistant to the villainous Mayor Richard Wilkins, and behaves nervously around his demonic boss. In the episode \\"Bad Girls\\", Allan admits that he likes reading the comic strip Cathy. He is later killed by Faith, who mistakes him for a vampire. Although Faith tries to dismiss the accident because Allan was involved in criminal activities, Buffy points out that he may have been coming to warn them about the Mayor's plan. Allan's death sparks a police investigation and is a major turning point for Faith, catalysing her betrayal of Buffy and the Scooby Gang. =Detective Stein= Detective Stein is a member of the Sunnydale police force, and is played by James G. MacDonald. He is first seen in the Season Two episode \\"Ted\\", in which he is in charge of the investigation of the death of Ted Buchanan, who apparently died after Buffy kicked him down the stairs in her home. He next appears in the episode \\"Becoming, Part Two\\" investigating Kendra's death. His final appearance is in the Season Three episode \\"Consequences\\" in which he questions Buffy and Faith about the death of Deputy Mayor Allan Finch. =Devon MacLeish= Devon MacLeish is a student at Sunnydale High, lead singer of the band Dingoes Ate My Baby, and a friend of Oz. He appears in Seasons Two, Three and Four, and is played by Jason Hall. Despite appearing in several episodes, he never features very prominently. Devon has also dated cheerleaders Cordelia Chase and Harmony Kendall, albeit briefly. He willingly assists in the battle against the Mayor. After Oz's departure in Season Four, the Dingoes, including Devon, are not seen again. =Dingoes Ate My Baby= Dingoes Ate My Baby are one of several bands that perform at The Bronze. The band consists of lead singer Devon MacLeish, Oz, and unnamed others. =Doc= Doc, played by Joel Grey, is a Season 5 character who appears to be an eccentric old man but is actually a reptilian demon with vast knowledge of the dark arts. He first appears after Joyce Summers dies, when Spike takes Dawn Summers to him to ask how to resurrect her mother. Later Spike and Xander come to him looking for information about Glory. Doc attempts to stall for time and dispose of a small wooden chest containing information on Glory's plans. When Spike sees through this, Doc drops the \\"harmless old man\\" fa√ßade and reveals that he worships Glory. After a brief skirmish, in which his speed gives him a great advantage, Doc is apparently killed when Xander puts a sword through his chest. Spike and Xander grab the chest out of the fire and leave; once they are gone, Doc opens his eyes. Doc later appears on the tower where Glory has placed Dawn for her ritual; with Glory occupied fighting Buffy, Doc has come to complete the ritual of bleeding Dawn on his own. Spike attempts to stop him but is easily pushed off the tower. Buffy reaches Doc soon after and casually pushes him off the tower in her race to save Dawn. He is not seen again, the fall having presumably killed him. =Dracula= Dracula appears in the episode \\"Buffy vs. Dracula\\", played by Rudolf Martin. Initially, the vampire who was going to show Buffy a darker side of herself was envisioned as \\"just another vampire who rode a horse and was all cool\\", says writer Marti Noxon. \\"I kept saying, 'Like Dracula ‚Äì until Joss Whedon said, \\"Why not Dracula? He's public domain.\\" Dracula arrives in Sunnydale, having heard stories about Buffy and wanting to meet her for himself. After introducing himself to the starstruck Scoobies, Dracula hypnotizes Xander into becoming a Renfield of sorts and then bites Buffy in exactly the same place where the Master and Angel had bitten her. In the final confrontation, Dracula has Buffy drink his own blood; however, the disgust of doing so allows her to break free of his thrall, battle him, and ultimately stake him. When he attempts to reform from dust, Buffy, wise to his tricks after seeing his movies, stakes him once again, and Dracula respectfully accepts that the Slayer is too strong for him and leaves Sunnydale. He reappears in the canon post-finale comics Tales of the Vampires: Antique, and later the Season Eight story \\"Wolves at the Gate\\" (both written by Drew Goddard). Outside of canon, Dracula appears in Spike vs. Dracula, which reveals that Dracula has connections to the gypsy clan that cursed Angel with a soul. As established by his appearance in \\"Buffy vs. Dracula\\", he is an acquaintance of Anya and Spike. Spike describes Dracula as a sell-out of the vampire world, fond of magic and Hollywood, and complains that his craving for fame allowed Bram Stoker to tell the whole world how to kill vampires; furthermore, \\"Poncy bugger owes me ¬£11, for one thing.\\" Though he is a celebrity among both humans and demons, to the extent that the Scooby Gang was actually more flattered than threatened that he had come to confront them, he is now considered by most to be a myth. Dracula has special abilities (almost all of which are derived straight out of Stoker's novel Dracula), described by Spike as \\"showy gypsy stuff\\". These abilities include transforming into a cloud of fog and animals, wolves and bats in particular, and the ability to control minds (put someone under his \\"thrall\\"), as he does to Xander in \\"Buffy vs. Dracula\\". He also appears to be immune to staking to some extent: he still falls to dust when staked, appearing to die like other vampires, but can reform himself from said dust almost immediately thereafter, as well as manipulating the cloud even once 'dusted.' In Tales of the Vampires: Antique, Xander spends time with Dracula as his manservant, during which time Xander teaches him to ride a motorcycle. During Xander's tenure as a manservant, Dracula develops an emotional attachment to him. After Buffy rescues Xander, Dracula sinks into depression and alcoholism, appearing old and decrepit. While drunk, Dracula gambles with a group of Japanese vampires, betting his powers against a Kawasaki 21000 motorcycle, and loses. Upon hearing that Xander has come to seek his assistance, he returns to his normal appearance. Despite his hatred of Buffy and the Slayers in general, Dracula agrees to help them defeat the vampires who swindled him. He assists Willow in preparing a spell to counter the magical plans of Toru, their leader, who plans to undo the spell that Willow cast at the Hellmouth in Sunnydale. Dracula gives Xander his sword, which he uses to kill Toru and avenge Renee's death. Dracula next appears in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten when the new rules of magic have led to the creation of new vampires whose powers greatly resemble Dracula. He is recruited by Buffy and the others to assist, but ends up exploiting the reality-altering Vampyr book to transform himself into \\"the most powerful\\" vampire of them all. However, Dracula's attempts backfire, and he is transformed instead into Maloker, the Old One who was the progenitor of the vampires. Buffy and her crew are able to fend off Maloker and return Dracula to normal. Later, in the final issue of the series, Dracula is recruited to Buffy's Magic Council ‚Äì in essence, a governing body of the magical universe ‚Äì to represent the vampire faction. =Dreg= Dreg is one of the minions serving season five's big bad Glory. He is the first of Glory's minions to appear and helps her create the giant reptilian monster. He is killed in Blood Ties by the Knights of Byzantium. E =Enyos= Jenny Calendar's uncle Enyos appears in \\"Surprise\\" and \\"Innocence\\", played by Vincent Schiavelli. He comes to Sunnydale to confirm that Jenny is keeping an eye on Angel, and that his soul continues to torment him. He reveals a loophole in the curse by which the Kalderash gave Angel his human soul: if he should ever have a moment of complete happiness, his soul will be lost again. This occurs, and Angelus kills him. =Ethan Rayne= Ethan Rayne is a foe to Rupert Giles and is portrayed by actor Robin Sachs. The two were friends who met in London after Giles had dropped out of Oxford. The group practiced small magics for pleasure and gain, until Ethan and Ripper discovered something bigger: the demon known as Eyghon, or the Sleepwalker. Tattooing themselves with the Mark of Eyghon, they would take turns falling asleep, and the rest of the group would summon the demon into the sleeper. According to Giles, it was an extraordinary high, a euphoric feeling of power, but was also incredibly risky. When Eyghon took control of Randall, one of their group, the others tried to exorcise the demon, resulting in Randall's death. Giles was changed by the event, leaving London and returning to the Watchers' Council. Ethan, on the other hand, went in the opposite direction, delving deeper into the black arts. Ethan was first introduced in the second-season episode \\"Halloween\\" as the seemingly benevolent owner of a costume shop. Ethan curses his costumes in the name of the Roman god Janus, so that the wearer becomes whatever they are dressed as. Later that season, in the episode \\"The Dark Age\\", Ethan has been having dreams of Eyghon, and the fate of the others who wear The Mark of Eyghon, which acts as a beacon for the demon to locate them, kill them, and possess each corpse in turn to hunt his next victim with. Ethan knocks Buffy unconscious, and tattoos the Mark of Eyghon on the back of her neck and removing his own. The substitution works, and the demon loses interest in him, instead going after Buffy. But Giles arrives, and then her friends, who stop Eyghon from killing both of them. During the third-season episode \\"Band Candy\\", the vampire Mr. Trick, in the employ of Mayor Richard Wilkins, calls on Ethan's services to curse candy bars that are distributed to adults through Sunnydale High School students. The curse on the chocolate makes adults act as if they are teenagers, leaving many areas of the city unprotected, including the hospital from which a tribute of small babies needs to be taken. Buffy and Giles uncover the plot, and stop Mr. Trick and Ethan (who claims ignorance of the nature of the tribute), but they both escape. In the fourth season, Ethan returns to Sunnydale in the episode \\"A New Man\\". Discovered lurking in a crypt by Giles, he talks him out of a promised beating, and instead, they go for a drink together. Ethan warns Giles that the Initiative is throwing the worlds out of balance, which goes \\"way beyond chaos\\", into \\"one hell of a fight\\". Giles doesn't seem to take the warning seriously, instead being somewhat envious of the Initiative. After spending the night reminiscing and drinking with Ethan, Giles wakes the next morning in the form of a Fyarl demon. After being forced to reverse the spell, Ethan is arrested by the Initiative, who apparently place him in military custody pending determination of his status, before sending him to a rehabilitation facility in Nevada. Afterwards, despite not trusting Ethan, Giles had Buffy to be cautious with the Initiative, eventually leading the Scooby Gang to discover its corruption and dangerous plans. F =First Slayer= The First Slayer (referred to in 4.21 \\"Primeval\\" as Daughter of Sineya, the First of the Ones and in Angel episode 5.11 \\"Damage\\" as the Primitive) was the first in the line of Slayers. The character is portrayed by Sharon Ferguson. She first appears in the Season Four finale \\"Restless\\", where she attacks Willow, Xander, and Giles in their respective dreams before attempting to kill Buffy in the same fashion after she refuses to leave her friends for dead. The First Slayer ultimately fails when Buffy wakes up from her sleep, thus pulling herself and her friends out of the First Slayer's nightmare. Giles reveals that the First Slayer never had a Watcher, and attributes her appearance to the enjoining spell they cast with Buffy in \\"Primeval\\", claiming that invoking the essence of the Slayer's power was an affront to the source of that power. In the script, she is referred to as the Primitive. A spirit in the form of the First Slayer appears again the next season, when Buffy goes on a vision quest to learn more about her power in \\"Intervention\\". The spirit tells her that death is her gift, a message Buffy is reluctant to believe, but one which is ultimately proven when she sacrifices herself in the season finale \\"The Gift\\". In the season seven episode \\"Get It Done\\", the First Slayer appears to Buffy in a dream and warns her that the current efforts against the First are not enough. The origin of the Slayer is also explained in this episode: The Slayer was created thousands of years ago by a group of shamans who tied a girl to the earth against her will then mystically implanted her with the essence of a demon. At the cost of most of her humanity, the First Slayer gained great strength, stamina and a predatorial instinct; this is the complete legacy that passes from Slayer to Slayer. The First Slayer appears in the graphic novel, Tales of the Slayers, in which she is asked to leave a village she defended from a vampire because the villagers fear her even more than other demons and again in Tales of the Slayer. She also cameos in the comic mini-series Fray #3, when a Slayer in the future is told the origins of her power, and in the Buffy Season Eight storyline \\"The Long Way Home\\" as an image of Buffy's dreamscape. =Forrest Gates= Forrest Gates is a friend of Riley Finn and member of the Initiative who appears in Season Four, played by Leonard Roberts. Like his teammates Riley and Graham, Forrest leads a double life, balancing his military service with his cover as a student at UC Sunnydale. He is the quintessential rule- following soldier, and while initially he likes Buffy and encourages Riley to pursue a relationship with her, her effect on Riley makes him angry and suspicious of her motives. As events proceed and Buffy becomes an enemy of the Initiative, Forrest's dislike increases and he accuses her of killing Maggie Walsh. Forrest is killed by Adam, but is then artificially reanimated with body parts from various demons and technological components. This \\"new\\" Forrest tries to assist Adam in defeating Buffy, and assaults her when she and her friends attack the Initiative complex. Beforehand, he is ordered by Adam to kill Spike, who escapes by blinding Forrest in the left eye with a lit cigarette. He is instead forced to face his old friend Riley in combat. Although he is clearly more than a physical match for Riley, he is killed a second time when he hoists a gas canister over his head, which catches a live wire and blows him to pieces. G =The General= The General (real name unknown) was a general in the American army who replaced General Voll in the Twilight's cabal in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight. He supplied a large military force to Twilight as part of a war on the Slayers. He appeared alongside Twilight's lieutenants, Amy and Warren, in several issues. In the comic book's final issue, he is shot dead by the rogue Slayer Simone in a revenge attack. =General Voll= General Voll is a general in the United States Army. He only appears in \\"The Long Way Home\\" story arc of Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight, the television series' official continuation. Voll investigates the ruins of Sunnydale before later soliciting Warren Mears and Amy Madison to kill Buffy. After capturing Willow Rosenberg and confronting Buffy in the ensuing melee, he mentions that he is part of the group called \\"Twilight\\", which views the Slayers as a threat to humanity. General Voll's current status and whereabouts are unknown. =Genevieve Savidge= Lady Genevieve Savidge is a British socialite Slayer who appears in the \\"No Future for You\\" story arc of Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight, the television series' official continuation. She is introduced by writer Brian K. Vaughan. She is targeted for assassination by Giles due to her plans to usurp Buffy's place in the Slayer hierarchy and, ultimately, end the world. He sends Faith to kill her. She is guided by an Irish warlock called Roden, who serves Twilight. With Roden, she hunts and kills other Slayers as part of his \\"training\\" of her. However, she and Faith find they share a lot in common; both as Slayers and as troubled young women enticed by evil, despite their drastically different backgrounds (upper class British and working class South Boston). Discovering Faith's treachery and tenuous affiliation with Buffy, she distraughtly fights Faith to the death, and is accidentally killed by an axe. At the same time, Giles kills Roden and puts an end to their plans. Her death deeply affects Faith, causing her to want to find other slayers like Genevieve and guide them back to the side of good. =Graham Miller= Graham Miller is a friend of Riley Finn and member of the Initiative who appears in Seasons Four and Five. He is played by Bailey Chase. Like his teammates Riley and Forrest, Graham leads a double life, balancing his military service with his cover as a student at UC Sunnydale. Whereas Forrest is a rather brash person, Graham is more calm and collected. He also was supportive of the relationship between Buffy and Riley, unlike Forrest. Graham survives the final battle in the Initiative complex and later testifies in Riley's favor during the inquiry. In Season Five, Graham helps Riley to get medical attention to correct the procedures that the Initiative conducted on him. Graham later asks Major Ellis to persuade Riley to leave Sunnydale and rejoin the army as part of a new squad of demon-hunters. H =Hank Summers= Hank Summers is the father of Buffy and Dawn and the ex-husband of Joyce Summers. He is played by Dean Butler. He first appears in the episode \\"Nightmares\\", in which Buffy worries that he will not show up for their father/daughter weekend. In the Season Two opener \\"When She Was Bad\\", Hank admits to Joyce that Buffy was distant with him during their summer together. In Season Three, Hank is supposed to take Buffy to an ice show for her eighteenth birthday, but cancels at the last minute. In the Season One Angel episode \\"I Will Remember You\\" (contemporary with Buffy season 4), Buffy appears in Los Angeles and tells Angel that she is visiting her father. In later seasons, Hank's character is developed further off-screen into the archetype of an upper-class deadbeat dad. Despite his relative wealth, Buffy cannot rely on him, and he will not play the role of the father. When Buffy last heard from Hank, he had moved to Spain with his secretary, but she is unable to contact him when her mother dies in Season Five. Dawn indicates in \\"Bargaining\\" that she has spoken with her father at some point over the summer between Seasons Five and Six, but she and the others are hiding Buffy's death from him. Hank's final onscreen appearance is in the episode \\"Normal Again\\", set in an alternate reality where the events of the show are simply Buffy's hallucinations. I =India Cohen= India Cohen immediately preceded Buffy Summers as the Slayer. In The Book of Fours, she was described as a slayer of water (with Faith representing fire, and Buffy representing air). Her watcher was Christopher Botwell, whom she called \\"Kit\\". India was born in 1978 in North Carolina. Her father was an officer in the U. S. Navy and her mother was a popular actress in the Philippines. She had some doubts about her parentage, speculating that her real father could not marry her mother for some reason. She was called as a Slayer in 1993 while she was living in Japan where her father, a submarine commander, was stationed. Together with her watcher, she traveled all over Japan slaying vampires. India witnessed Spike and Drusilla during this time, but they never encountered India directly. Over a few years, India and her Watcher Christopher fell in love, but had to keep it a secret from the Watchers Council. Christopher even brought her a dog, which she named Mariposa. In 1996, India and her family returned to America and went to California. There, wanderer mummies attacked and tried to steal India's soul. India fended them off, but they captured her watcher and Mariposa. India sacrificed herself so that she could save her only family. The Wanderer killed India and released Kit and her dog. It wasn't until after she died that Kit realized his true feelings for her. He contacted a woman called Cecille Lafitte, who turned out to be a voodoo priestess living inside another woman's body. She presented herself as a psychic who could help him contact India and he believed every word she said. Cecille brainwashed him and made him a servant of the Gatherer without him really knowing what was going on. He then came into his final contact with India when, in a final showdown, India inhabited the body of Willow Rosenberg. She apologized and threw herself off of a cliff to save Buffy Summers and Faith Lehane, yet somehow, though killing her spirit, left Willow completely intact. When India was killed in San Diego, California, Buffy was called as the slayer in Los Angeles. India apparently came into contact with The Master, as he commented on how Buffy was \\"prettier than the last one\\". J =Janice Penshaw= Janice Penshaw is Dawn's best friend and is portrayed by Amber Tamblyn. She is mentioned throughout Season Six, though she only appears in the episode \\"All the Way\\" (the Halloween episode). During her only on-screen appearance, she and Dawn claim to be spending the night at each other's houses while they sneak out to walk the streets with a couple of boys, who turn out to be vampires. During the night, Dawn gets her first kiss from one of the vampires and Janice is bitten by the other, but is rescued by Giles. Dawn is later rescued from a vampire gang by Buffy, Giles, and also Spike, who is personally offended by the vampires hunting on Halloween. Dawn mentions in \\"Doublemeat Palace\\" that Janice's sister is a lawyer. In \\"Normal Again\\" she says that she likes staying at Janice's house because everyone there seems to like having her around, unlike at home. =Jesse McNally= Jesse McNally is a Sunnydale High student played by Eric Balfour. In \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\", Jesse is seen as a close friend of Xander Harris and Willow Rosenberg, and a \\"potential friend\\" of Buffy Summers. During \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\" and \\"The Harvest\\", Jesse is captured by Darla and Luke, sired, and used as bait to lure Buffy to her death. He is accidentally staked in \\"The Harvest\\" by Xander. Jesse's death and transformation cause Xander to develop resentment towards vampires, and made him see that they are embodiments of demons with no humanity in them. Years later, Xander confides to San Francisco Police Department detective Robert Dowling of the painful experience of having to stake Jesse, revealing that he is guilt-ridden of being unable to save his best friend from being sired. Joss Whedon states in the \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\" DVD commentary that he had always wanted to kill a character listed as a regular in one of their first appearances. He considered listing Balfour in the two-part pilot as a regular, only to surprise the audience by killing him off. Financial restrictions did not allow for this but Whedon later used the trick in the sixth season, putting Amber Benson in the credits for the first time in the episode where her character Tara Maclay was killed. =Jinx= Jinx, portrayed by Troy Blendell, is one of the minions serving Glory, the Big Bad of Season Five. Like all her minions, he belongs to an unnamed race of demons who are shorter than most humans, with scabby skin and black eyes; they wear brown robes. Jinx seems to be a leader among Glory's minions, and Glory often assigns him to tasks of some importance. He is the one who discovers from Ben that the Key is in human form. Jinx is beaten and stabbed by Ben, and nearly killed by the Knights of Byzantium before being saved by Glory herself at the last minute. He is often blamed by Glory when something isn't going the right way for her. The last episode in which he is seen is \\"Tough Love\\". =Judge= The Judge is an ancient and legendary blue-skinned demon from the Middle Ages, portrayed by Brian Thompson, who also portrayed the vampire Luke in \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\" and \\"The Harvest\\". He was brought forth to rid Earth of the plague of humanity. He was named The Judge for he had come to separate the righteous from the wicked and burn the righteous down. In the 14th century an army was sent against the Judge, and though most of the warriors died, the army was able to dismember the Judge, but not to kill him, as \\"no weapon forged\\" can kill him. The pieces were placed in iron boxes and buried \\"in every corner of the Earth\\". For six hundred years he remained aware of his status. In the two- part episode \\"Surprise\\"/\\"Innocence\\", he is restored by Drusilla after she has gathered together all the boxes, but is then blasted into pieces by Buffy with a US Army FGM-148 Javelin rocket launcher, revealing that the \\"no weapon forged\\" rule from the 14th century was merely descriptive, not prophetic. (However, the argument can be made that the \\"no weapon forged by man\\" rule is not violated, as the Javelin uses a self-forging warhead to kill tanks. As the weapon forges itself, it lies outside the rule on killing The Judge.) The Scooby Gang picks up the pieces and keeps them separate. K =Kakistos= Kakistos (played by Jeremy Roberts), whose name () is said in the series to be Ancient Greek for \\"the worst of the worst\\" (in actuality, the word means simply \\"worst\\"), is, like the Master, a vampire so ancient that he can no longer assume human appearance; his hands and feet have become cloven hooves. He is famous enough that Rupert Giles recognizes his name even though Buffy Summers misrecalls it as \\"Kissing Toast\\" or \\"Taquitos\\" on first hearing. He had assembled a small cult of fanatically-loyal minions, whose motto was \\"For Kakistos we live, for Kakistos you die.\\" In the Season Three episode \\"Faith, Hope & Trick\\", Kakistos traveled to Sunnydale to hunt down Faith and enact revenge for a previous battle in which Faith's first Watcher was killed and Kakistos lost an eye. Faith had come to Sunnydale hoping to avoid him. Buffy staked Kakistos to no avail, but Faith impaled the vampire with a large beam of wood, finally killing him. However, unlike the Master, who was so ancient and powerful that he left behind a skeleton when he died, Kakistos simply turned to dust. In the video game Chaos Bleeds, Faith is forced to confront an alternate universe version of Kakistos in an abandoned quarry. The novel Go Ask Malice describes Faith's earliest encounters with him. Kakistos also appears in the Angel graphic novel series \\"Blood and Trenches\\", set during World War I. =Kathy Newman= Kathy Newman (played by Dagney Kerr) appears in the first two episodes of Season Four: \\"The Freshman\\" and \\"Living Conditions\\". She is Buffy's first roommate in the dormitory at UC Sunnydale. She is portrayed as an overly-eager and annoyingly cheery teenage girl, who wanted \\"a stable non-smoker\\" for a roommate. Kathy and Buffy soon begin to have serious disagreements. Kathy plays Cher's \\"Believe\\" on repeat loop, obsessively labels all her property (including each individual egg in the fridge), and is more of a neat freak than Buffy can handle. Buffy begins to act uncharacteristically hostile towards Kathy, and at first, her friends believe it is simply due to Buffy's upbringing as an only child. Later, it is revealed that Kathy is in fact a demon who had fled her own dimension to go to college. Her clan was about to locate her, so she performed a series of spells to mask her presence from them by gradually removing Buffy's soul. Being demons, her people have no human souls; thus, when they came looking for her, they would mistake Buffy for her and take Buffy instead. In the end, Giles reverses the spell and Kathy is taken back to her dimension by her angry father. Willow, who has gone through her own roommate problems, moves in with Buffy afterwards. =Katrina Silber= Katrina Silber is the on and off- girlfriend of Warren Mears who appears in Seasons Five and Six, and is played by Amelinda Embry. She is introduced the episode \\"I Was Made to Love You\\", in which she is horrified to discover that Warren had previously built a robotic version of what he considered to be the perfect girlfriend, called April. When the jealous April tries to kill her, Katrina is disgusted and breaks up with Warren. She reappears in the episode \\"Dead Things\\" of the next season when Warren attempts to rape her using a mind control device. However, the effects are short-lived and when Katrina returns to normal, she realizes what Warren has done and threatens to report his activities to the police. Katrina successfully fights off Andrew and Jonathan ‚Äì who Warren calls on to stop her leaving ‚Äì but as she tries to escape, Warren grabs a bottle and murders her. He later uses magic to make Buffy believe that she has accidentally killed Katrina while fighting demons. The plan almost works, but when Buffy hears Katrina's name, she remembers the events of \\"I Was Made to Love You\\" and guesses that Warren is responsible. Katrina's last appearance is as a spirit, conjured by Willow to torment Warren after he kills Willow's girlfriend Tara. Katrina's spirit is understandably angry with Warren and suggests that she should have killed him before he killed her. =Kendra Young= Kendra Young is a Slayer played by Bianca Lawson. She is called to be the Slayer when Buffy Summers dies at the hands of the Master in May 1997. Though Xander manages to revive her, Buffy's death nevertheless activates a second Slayer, causing two to exist at the same time (a first in history). No one in Sunnydale is aware of her existence until she surprises Buffy in \\"What's My Line, Part One\\". Kendra is fully versed in the Slayer Handbook and fighting techniques, and has been separated from her family since she was a young child in order to train for her role as the Slayer. Hence, she says she has no last name, but Joss Whedon gave her the last name \\"Young\\". Unlike Buffy, Kendra has no friends, has never been to school and is not permitted to speak to boys (although she develops a crush on Xander Harris and often stutters when he's around). Her appearance is the first time the Watchers' Council has been shown to identify potential Slayers. Her tenure as a Slayer is approximately one year; she is killed by Drusilla in \\"Becoming, Part One\\", set in May 1998. Before her death, she gives Buffy her favorite stake, which she calls \\"Mr. Pointy\\". J. P. Williams states that from the perspective of the Watchers' Council, Kendra is the \\"practically perfect Slayer: solemn, respectful, and efficient\\". She has mastered the use of every weapon reliant on muscle power, such as swords, knives, and axes, and although she has less field experience, she possesses more textbook knowledge about slaying than Buffy (from her Watcher and the Slayer's Handbook‚Äîa book that Giles felt was pointless to give to Buffy). Unlike Buffy, Kendra wields her power \\"exactly as her superiors instruct\\". However, Kendra's tendency to unhesitatingly follow orders means she lacks moral autonomy and is easily hypnotized by Drusilla; Jana Riess argues that Kendra's death occurred because \\"she always obeyed without question and has not strengthened her mind and spirit by discovering her own unique path.\\" Ironically, Kendra's initial reaction to Buffy's insistence of doing things her own way instead of following orders was to retort, \\"No wonder you died\\" (\\"What's My Line, Part Two\\"). Although her place of birth is never identified, she speaks with the accent of an individual from somewhere in the West Indies. The addition of the Jamaican accent to the character was a last-minute decision, and a dialect coach was brought in; he taught Lawson a dialect that was supposedly from a very specific, obscure region of Jamaica, and while the accent may have sounded authentic to that region, to the rest of the cast and crew (and the majority of the viewing audience), it simply sounded like a very bad impersonation of a common Jamaican accent.Marti Noxon, \\"What's My Line, Part 1\\" DVD Commentary After her death, Kendra was succeeded by Faith Lehane. =Kit Holburn= Kit Holburn portrayed by Alexandra Breckenridge, was a student at the new rebuilt Sunnydale High, and along with Carlos Traverse a close friend of Dawn Summers. In the first episode of season seven \\"Lessons\\", Kit was targeted by three Manifest Spirits but survived thanks to Buffy. Later on in the season we see Dawn talking to Kit on the phone in the episode \\"Conversations With Dead People\\" before an evil spirit invades the Summers home. According to Principal Wood, Kit was a bit of a trouble maker with a thick permanent record. L =Larry Blaisdell= Larry Blaisdell is a student at Sunnydale High who appears in Seasons Two and Three, and is played by Larry Bagby III. He is initially portrayed as a stereotypical jock, first seen bullying Xander in the episode \\"Halloween\\". He is also rather lecherous, constantly harassing girls, including Buffy and Willow. In \\"Phases\\", Xander presses Larry to confess to a series of werewolf attacks, saying that he has been through something similar himself (when he was possessed by a hyena spirit in \\"The Pack\\"). Larry misunderstands Xander's indirect language as meaning that Xander, like himself, is a closeted homosexual. This misunderstanding is echoed in most subsequent conversations between them, and also leads to Larry's own coming out and the revelation of his more caring and compassionate side. He and Xander also become friends, but the latter is uncomfortable when Larry talks about Xander's sexual orientation. In the alternate universe created in \\"The Wish\\", Larry is one of Rupert Giles' \\"white hats\\", along with Oz and a girl named Nancy. In the Season Three finale \\"Graduation Day, Part Two\\", he is seen in the front line of battle against the Mayor of Sunnydale, who has morphed into the gigantic demon Olvikan. He is last seen being thrown to the ground by a swipe of the Mayor's tail. His death is confirmed in the Season Six episode \\"Smashed\\", when Willow informs Amy Madison that Larry will not be taking her to the prom because \\"Larry's gay, Larry's dead, and high school's kinda over.\\" =Leah= Leah is a Slayer who appears in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight comics, first appearing in \\"The Long Way Home\\". Leah has large, puffy red hair and is a member of Buffy's squad along with Satsu and Rowena. She speaks with a Scottish burr. When Buffy chooses Satsu out of all the Slayers to help her rescue Willow, Leah agrees with Satsu when she states that she should not have been picked, and tells her not to embarrass them. She is featured in the \\"Wolves at the Gate\\" arc, fighting vampires in Tokyo alongside the other Slayers. In the \\"Time of Your Life\\" Arc, Leah is the one who discovers that Dawn Summers has changed from a giant to a centaur. After the castle headquarters is struck by a missile, she is seen being carried to safety by two Slayers. She recovers from her injuries in time to join prominently in the battle against the magically conjured snake-men in the nearby forest. In the \\"Retreat\\" arc, Leah accompanies Buffy and the other Slayers to Tibet, where they surrender their powers in hopes of escaping the notice of the villain Twilight. Leah alerts the rest of the group when a cat that had been sitting in her lap suddenly disappears, leading them to realize that the cat had been Twilight's ally, Amy Madison, in disguise, and that their location has been discovered. In the season's climactic battle at the Sunnydale Hellmouth, Leah is saved by Giles from a dragon-like demon which incinerates the rest of her group. =Lucy Hanover= Lucy Hanover is a deceased Slayer who appears in Buffy the Vampire Slayer literature. She is first mentioned in the History of the Slayer WB advertisements for the Buffy television series: The character is expanded upon in comics and novels, in which she appears as a ghostly ally of the Scooby Gang. She is the mother of Roland and is the only other known Slayer to face the Wild Hunt (in Virginia during 1865) (Child of the Hunt); provides the gang with vital information when they face a vampire who can reincarnate into another body at the moment of death (Immortal); warns Willow about the coming of the Gatherer (The Book of Fours), even summoning other spirits to help deal with it; and guides a temporally-displaced Buffy back into her past self. In that battle, she possesses a vampire to aid Buffy's friends in battle before Oz accidentally kills her host, and helps the group trap an evil spirit who had tricked her in an alternate timeline (The Lost Slayer). Her role now is to guide lost spirits to the afterlife. =Luke= Luke is a vampire who is a powerful member of Order of Aurelius. When we meet The Master, he is trapped in the Hellmouth under Sunnydale. He has a once-in-a-century opportunity to escape in a ritual called The Harvest, which calls for him to use the strongest of his brood (Luke) as his \\"Vessel\\". The only way to prevent The Master's escape is for Buffy to kill the Vessel. At the end of \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\", Luke flings Buffy into a stone coffin and it looks as though he is going to kill her. At the beginning of \\"The Harvest\\", she escapes. When Buffy and Luke meet again for a fight to the finish at The Bronze, she defeats him using subterfuge: she breaks a window that had been painted over, admitting the light of a streetlamp, which Luke momentarily mistakes for sunlight, distracting him long enough for Buffy to stake him. Luke is played by Brian Thompson. =Lydia= Lydia is a Watcher who appeared in Seasons Five and Seven, and is played by Cynthia Lamontagne. In the episode \\"Checkpoint\\", she travels to Sunnydale with Quentin Travers to test Buffy's abilities as the Slayer. As the Watchers' Council interviews Buffy's friends, Lydia nervously questions Spike, and blushingly admits that she wrote her thesis on him. Lydia reappears in the episode \\"Never Leave Me\\", in which she reports to Travers about the increasing strength of the First Evil and is killed in the explosion which destroys the Watchers' Council. M =Merrick= Merrick is Buffy's first Watcher who appears in the Buffy movie, played by Donald Sutherland. He arrives in Los Angeles to inform Buffy of her destiny, and train her in using her Slayer abilities. In the movie, he is a pseudo-immortal: born to train Slayers, ultimately dying, and reborn again with the memories of his previous life. He is initially tough and stern with his charge, but eventually comes to respect her methods. In the film, Merrick is murdered by the vampire Lothos, and dies telling Buffy to do things her own way rather than live by others' rules. Although the film is not canonical in the fictional universe of the series, Merrick does appear briefly in a flashback to Buffy's calling in the Season Two finale \\"Becoming, Part One\\", and is played by Richard Riehle. Merrick also appears in the Dark Horse Comics limited series The Origin, an adaptation of the original script for the movie. In this version of the story, Merrick (based on Riehle rather than Sutherland) is a normal man and member of the Watcher's Council and not the pseudo-immortal from the film. He is also not killed directly by Lothos, but instead shoots himself rather than be turned into a vampire and risk harming his Slayer. Joss Whedon has confirmed the canonicity of The Origin with the television series, stating \\"The origin comic, though I have issues with it, CAN pretty much be accepted as canonical. They did a cool job of combining the movie script (the SCRIPT) with the series, that was nice, and using the series' Merrick and not a certain OTHER thespian who shall remain hated.\\" =Miss Kitty Fantastico= Miss Kitty Fantastico is the pet kitten of Tara and Willow. She is a black/grey kitten with white rear feet, a white stripe from her chin to chest, and a small spot of white fur around her nose. Introduced at the end of Season Four, Miss Kitty only appears in three episodes, \\"The Yoko Factor\\", \\"Restless\\" and \\"Family\\", although Willow and Tara had discussed getting a cat in \\"New Moon Rising\\". After Season Five, Miss Kitty Fantastico is not mentioned again until the penultimate episode of Season Seven, \\"End of Days\\", when Dawn claims, \\"I don't leave crossbows around all willy-nilly. Not since that time with Miss Kitty Fantastico.\\" =Molly= Molly is a Potential Slayer who comes to Sunnydale in Season Seven, and is played by Clara Bryant. She is introduced in \\"Bring on the Night\\" along with fellow Potentials Kennedy and Annabelle. Molly speaks with a cockney accent and confuses the other characters by using British slang such as \\"peckish\\". According to Kennedy she is very talkative and this seems to be true. When the Potentials are locked in a crypt with a vampire as part of a training routine in the episode \\"Potential\\", Molly is the one who slays the vampire. In the episode \\"Dirty Girls\\", Molly is one of the casualties in the battle at the vineyard; she is stabbed to death by Caleb. =Murk= Murk is a minor recurring character during Season Five, played by Todd Duffey. He is a demon and one of Glory's acolytes, of the same species of demon as Jinx. He is shot by Spike with a crossbow during the Season Five finale. N =Nikki Wood= Nikki Wood is a Slayer who was active in New York City in the 1970s. Her first appearance is in the Season Five episode \\"Fool for Love\\", in which she is played by April Wheedon-Washington. In that episode, Spike tells Buffy the story of how he killed Nikki, with flashbacks revealing that he snapped her neck following a battle on a subway train in 1977 and took her leather duster as a trophy, which he continued to wear until it was destroyed in a bomb blast in early 2004. Nikki reappears, portrayed by K. D. Aubert, in the Season Seven episode \\"First Date\\", in which it is revealed that she had a son called Robin, now an ally of Buffy Summers. The First Evil presents itself to Robin in the form of his mother, and informs him that Spike was the one responsible for killing Nikki. Nikki features in flashbacks in the episode \\"Lies My Parents Told Me\\", in which Robin tries and fails to take revenge on Spike. Nikki appears in the story \\"Nikki Goes Down!\\" of the comic book miniseries Tales of the Slayers. In it, her boyfriend Li, a member of the NYPD, is killed during a battle with an oversized bat. She also appears in the prose short story \\"It's All About the Mission\\" of the novel Tales of the Slayer Vol. IV, in which her Watcher Bernard Crowley tries to avoid the Cruciamentum (a dangerous Watchers Council tradition in which a Slayer is stripped of her powers and tested) due to Nikki's pregnancy with Robin. Nikki features most heavily in her own novel Blackout, which tells the story leading up to her death as she battles Spike. The novel also reveals how she was called, and that she had rivalries with vampires Darla and Dracula. Nikki makes small cameos in the novel Queen of the Slayers, and the comics \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" and \\"The Chain\\". O =Olaf= Olaf is a troll who was once human, a tenth-century Viking who apparently often hunted trolls and was the lover or husband of Aud; he cheated on her with a \\"load-bearing\\" bar matron, and Aud punished him by transforming him into a gigantic hammer-wielding troll. The panache of this spell brought Aud to the attention of the demon D'Hoffryn, who recruited her as a vengeance demon, renaming her Anyanka (later known as Anya Jenkins). Olaf adjusted to life as a troll, but was eventually imprisoned in a crystal by witches. Olaf is introduced as a troll in \\"Triangle\\" (Season Five), where he is accidentally released from the crystal when a spell attempted by Willow goes awry (thanks to Anya); he is still, after 1200 years, angry at Anya. After wreaking havoc at both the Bronze and the Magic Box and badly injuring Xander, he is defeated by Buffy and sent to an alternate dimension (most likely the Land of the Trolls). He later appears in human form in a flashback in \\"Selfless\\" (Season Seven). Olaf's huge hammer was used by Buffy herself during her battle against Glory in \\"The Gift\\", during which they referred to him as \\"Olaf the Troll God\\". Olaf was played by Abraham Benrubi. =Olivia= Olivia is an old friend and romantic interest of Giles who appears in Season Four, and is played by Phina Oruche. Although she lives in England, Olivia visits Giles on two occasions. She is first introduced in \\"The Freshman\\" and is in Sunnydale during the events of \\"Hush\\". In \\"Hush\\", she shows artistic talent by drawing an accurate portrait of a Gentleman. At the end of \\"Hush\\", Olivia reveals she is not comfortable with Giles' role in battling the forces of evil. She appears pregnant and pushing an empty baby stroller in Giles' dream during \\"Restless\\" but is otherwise not seen again on the show. She appears in three episodes directed by Joss Whedon that season and is mentioned in the fourth (\\"Who Are You\\"). Olivia returns in the comics where she is present at Giles' funeral. When Giles is resurrected in the body of a 12-year-old, Olivia refuses to rekindle their relationship due to the large age difference. However, they do sleep together again when Willow casts a spell that temporarily ages Giles to early adulthood. P =Parker Abrams= Parker Abrams is a student at UC Sunnydale who appears in Season Four, played by Adam Kaufman. First appearing in the episode \\"Living Conditions\\", he meets Buffy and forms a seemingly intimate relationship with her. The pair sleep together in the next episode, \\"The Harsh Light of Day\\". However, while Buffy feels that the encounter represented an emotional bond, Parker considers it to be merely physical gratification, a moment of \\"healthy fun\\". Buffy expects Parker to contact her, which he never does. She eventually confronts him, but he is mostly cold and aloof, and Buffy soon realizes that the emotional intimacy she felt she had experienced with Parker was part of his calculated method to attract girls. In the episode \\"Beer Bad\\", Buffy's best friend Willow confronts Parker over what had happened. During that conversation, Parker attempts to seduce Willow, who initially plays along, but soon reveals she has seen through him and verbally attacks him. Later in the same episode, Parker tries to apologize to Buffy after she saves his life in a fire. However, Buffy, who has been mystically reverted to a cavewoman, merely responds by knocking him unconscious with a wooden club. Parker's final onscreen appearance is in the episode \\"The Initiative\\", in which Buffy's college TA Riley Finn punches him when he makes some rude comments about Buffy ‚Äì specifically that \\"the difference between a freshman girl and a toilet seat is that the toilet seat doesn't follow you around after you use it.\\" The creators of the show have stated that Parker was merely Buffy's failed attempt at a normal, new relationship, as she was still trying to completely get over her separation from Angel. Parker also appears in the non-canon \\"The Lost Slayer\\" series. =Percy West= Percy West is a student at Sunnydale High who appears in Seasons Three and Four, starting with the episode \\"Doppelgangland\\", and is played by Ethan Erickson. When Percy's low grades nearly make him ineligible for the basketball team, Principal Snyder insists that Willow tutor him; in Percy's mind, this means that Willow is going to do his work for him. After a frightening run-in with Willow's doppelg√§nger, a vampire from an alternate reality, Percy takes Willow's tutoring more seriously, writing up essays on both Presidents Roosevelt when he only needs to write about one, giving her an apple and quickly taking off. Later in the season, he helps to organize the students into a fighting force on graduation day in order to battle vampires and the Mayor himself. In the Season Four episode \\"Doomed\\", it is revealed that Percy got into USC on a football scholarship, but dates a girl at UC Sunnydale. Willow meets him at a party and is hurt when she overhears Percy calling her a nerd to his jealous girlfriend. This is his last appearance in the show. =Pike= Oliver Pike or often referred solely by his last name Pike is a friend and love interest of Buffy who appears in the Buffy film, and is played by Luke Perry. A hard-drinking and poverty-stricken slacker, he initially resents Buffy and her valley girl friends because of their snobbery. However, when Pike's friend Benny is turned into a vampire by a minion of Lothos, Pike and Buffy find themselves teaming up to take Lothos down, and an attraction forms between them. Although the Buffy film is not canon and Pike is never seen or mentioned in the television series, he does make a number of appearances in the Dark Horse comic book series. These include The Origin limited series, in which he plays a role similar to that in the film. He also appears in the story Note from the Underground, in which he arrives in Sunnydale between Seasons Six and Seven to help Buffy defeat a fascist demon group, the Scourge. Pike's relationship with Buffy is explored further in Scott Lobdell's and Fabian Nicieza's Year One-style run, which bridges the gap between The Origin and the television series. He and Buffy travel to Las Vegas, where Pike eventually realizes that their relationship endangers both of their lives, and breaks up with her. Pike's other literary appearances include the novel Sins of the Father; set during Season Three of the show, it involves Pike being chased to Sunnydale by a rock demon known as Grayhewn. =Principal Flutie= Robert \\"Bob\\" Flutie, played by Ken Lerner, is the principal of Sunnydale High School in the first half of Season One. Introduced in the series opener \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\", Principal Flutie is eaten alive by possessed students soon afterward (\\"The Pack\\"). Unlike his successor Principal Snyder, Flutie is dedicated to helping students and is concerned with their self-esteem and socialization. Snyder later quips, \\"That's the kind of woolly-headed liberal thinking that leads to being eaten.\\" (Ironically, Snyder suffers a similar fate two years later.) Flutie is mentioned again in the Season Seven episode \\"Beneath You\\"; when Principal Wood jokes about the students eating the staff alive, Buffy asks \\"You heard about Principal Flutie, right?\\" He was originally played by Stephen Tobolowsky in the unaired pilot, produced in 1996. Q =Quentin Travers= Quentin Travers is a member of the Watchers' Council (possibly its head, based on his actions and authority) who appears in Seasons Three, Five and Seven, and is played by Harris Yulin. In his first appearance, \\"Helpless\\", he insists that Buffy undergo a ruthless rite of passage on her eighteenth birthday known as the Cruciamentum. The test consists of depriving Buffy of her Slayer powers and forcing her to fight a vampire using cunning alone. Giles' reluctance to comply with the test and his paternal relationship with the Slayer leads Quentin to fire him as Buffy's official Watcher. Angered at having been subjected to the Council's rite of passage without her consent, Buffy informs Travers that if he appears in Sunnydale again she will kill him. In Season Five, Quentin returns to Sunnydale with a group of Watchers and offers Buffy information on her new nemesis, Glory. However, he will only provide the information if she successfully completes a set of rigorous trials. After an encounter with The Knights of Byzantium, Buffy realizes that she is the one with the power, not the Watchers' Council. Buffy explains the new facts of life to Quentin and the Watchers with him: that they work for her, not she for them; that Giles will be reinstated as her Watcher at full salary (retroactively from the month he was fired); that their mission is to provide her with information as requested; and that otherwise they will stay out of her way. Quentin acquiesces to all of her demands.Petrie, Douglas, & Espenson, Jane. Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Episode 5/12, \\"Checkpoint.\\" First aired January 23, 2001. Retrieved January 27, 2015. He reappears briefly in Season Seven, being caught in the explosion at the Watchers' Council headquarters. Travers' family is featured in the tie-in novel Spike and Dru: Pretty Maids All in a Row; Harold Travers, John Travers (Harold's son) and Arianna de la Croix (a Potential Slayer turned Watcher who falls in love with John). The character was invented by David Fury, who wrote the episode \\"Helpless\\"; Fury says in the DVD commentary that he wanted a \\"very British\\" name, and combined the names of Quentin Crisp and P. L. Travers. R =Rack= Rack is a warlock who appears in three episodes of Season Six: \\"Wrecked\\", \\"Villains\\" and \\"Two to Go\\". He is played by Jeff Kober, who previously played vampire Zachary Kralik in \\"Helpless\\". In \\"Wrecked\\", Amy talks Willow into paying Rack a visit after having exhausted all their own magical energy. Rack's lair is cloaked, being undetectable to all but demons and magic users. After the pleasantries, it becomes increasingly clear that Rack is the mystical equivalent of a drug dealer; Willow and Amy spend several hours with Rack, \\"high\\" on magic. Willow's addiction to magic becomes more severe, and she returns to Rack's apartment the next night with Dawn in tow. When Buffy mentions Rack to Spike, he immediately recognizes the name and is alarmed to learn Willow and Dawn are in Rack's company. After being chased by a demon (a side effect of Rack's spell) and causing an injury to Dawn's arm in a car accident, Willow renounces her use of magic and severs her contact with Rack and Amy. Rack appears again in \\"Villains\\" when Warren Mears, who is being hunted by Willow, pays Rack for protection magic. Willow subsequently kills Rack. Rack appears in the Season Nine miniseries Willow: Wonderland on a mission to restore magic to Earth. In another dimension, Willow allies herself with Marrak, an Earth warlock with a growing interest in dark magic. Eventually, Willow determines that Marrak is Rack, who has been trapped in the dimension since her assault on him. Rack had intended to use Willow's good side and his dark side to create enough magic to go back and rule Earth. During a magical duel with Willow, she refuses to give in to her dark side despite his taunts. Rack is absorbed by The Embodiment of Magic and his final fate remains unknown. =Ren√©e= Ren√©e is first seen manning a computer in issue #1 of Season Eight, enjoying flirtatious banter about comic books with Xander. In issue #2, another Slayer tells her that she's in love with Xander, having recently developed a keen interest in comics, James Bond films and drywalling. Later that issue, we see her stabbed from behind by a Scottish zombie, although she survives as seen in issue #3. She and Xander are starting to be \\"sparring partners\\" as stated by Xander in issue #6. In issue #7, she is sent by Buffy to talk to Willow about fixing the new radar stations installed to protect them from the army. In issue #12, she prompts Xander to ask her out, which he then does. In issue #14, Ren√©e kisses Xander. Later that night, she is impaled on the scythe and killed by the Japanese vampire Toru. =Robert Dowling= SFPD officer Robert Dowling is introduced in the first issue of Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine. He is investigating a series of murders of unmarked and unwounded Jane and John Does around the San Francisco area, which he hypothesized were vampires. After witnessing Buffy stake a vampire, he and his partner arrest her for homicide. After Buffy escapes custody, he declares her the target of a manhunt. After he is anonymously tipped off about the location of the real culprit, Severin, Dowling appears at the scene of a battle where Buffy and Spike are having their powers drained; he shoots Severin three times, hospitalizing him. Subsequently, he and his partner begin investigating vampires more strenuously until she too is turned. He is trained by Xander and Dawn both in how to kill vampires, and in understanding the difference between who the vampires once were and who they now are, using which he is able to kill his ex-partner. Dowling subsequently attempted to quit the force, but was put in charge of an anti-vampire task force instead, working alongside Buffy. Later, in \\"Welcome to the Team\\", he asks Buffy on a date ahead of a scheduled patrol with Buffy and her 16-year-old helper Billy Lane. However, he is bitten in the neck by a vampire just as Buffy is mysteriously teleported away from the scene of the fray. In the ensuing chaos in her life, as events rapidly lead her to the core of the Deeper Well, a mystical cave running through the Earth from end to end, Buffy entirely forgets about him. She recalls Robert suddenly in the first arc of Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten. Although she initially plans to explain that she is sorry for not visiting him and, ultimately, not ready to date, she finds herself mildly upset when he understands the situation and gets in there first to say they are better as friends. Dowling would call in Buffy and Spike whenever the police needed help with a supernatural crime. =Rona= Rona is a Potential Slayer who comes to Sunnydale in Season Seven, and is played by Indigo. Arriving in the episode \\"Showtime\\", Rona didn't know she was a Potential until the Bringers attacked her. A somewhat argumentative African-American girl, Rona eventually accepts her destiny and she survives the climactic Hellmouth battle despite being badly injured several times and having a broken arm (in a cast) throughout. She appears in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight story \\"The Chain\\", as the person who decides which Slayer will act as a decoy for Buffy Summers. =Rowena= Rowena is a Slayer who appears in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight comics, first appearing in \\"The Long Way Home\\". She is a blonde-haired Slayer who speaks with a European accent and is a member of Buffy's squad along with Satsu and Leah. In \\"Wolves at the Gate\\", Rowena takes charge of Buffy's squad when Buffy is trying to rescue Willow from Kumiko. In \\"Time of Your Life\\" she coordinates the evacuation of the Slayers' castle headquarters when it is struck by a missile, and later leads the Slayers and their Wiccan supporters into battle against the army of snake-men who were magically conjured by the missile's explosion. In the \\"Retreat\\" arc, Rowena is one of the group of Slayers who accompany Buffy to Tibet and temporarily sacrifice their powers to escape detection by their enemies. S =Saga Vasuki= Saga Vasuki (also known as Aluwyn) is a NƒÅga-like demon and Willow's magic teacher in the comic book Season Eight. Under her tutelage, Willow's power has increased massively. She first appears in \\"Anywhere but Here\\", in which the Old One Sephrilian shows Buffy a past vision of a nude Willow being embraced by Vasuki in an attempt to drive a wedge between the two. She later appears in person in \\"Time of Your Life\\" when Willow summons her to help rescue Buffy from the 23rd century-era New York City, during which it is revealed that Saga Vasuki's dimension can only be accessed when the witch attempting to summon her experiences an orgasm. It is also revealed that Willow and Vasuki's relationship is a sexual one, leaving Willow visibly guilty in the presence of an unaware Kennedy. Nonetheless, Saga Vasuki does seem to have genuine feelings for Willow, often addressing her as her \\"darling Willow\\". How Saga Vasuki came to be Willow's teacher is revealed in the one-shot comic Goddesses and Monsters. In the last arc of Season Eight, magic is stripped from the universe and Willow is no longer able to communicate with Aluwyn; as a result of her guilt, Willow dumps Kennedy. Aluwyn appears again in the Season Nine miniseries Willow: Wonderland. Due to her inability to reach Willow, she has formed a \\"supercoven\\" of powerful witches from various dimensions. When Willow explores a Wonderland-like dimension as part of her mission to restore magic to the world, she is reunited with Aluwyn. They later end their relationship when Willow realises Aluwyn is selfishly distracting Willow from her friends' peril. Aluwyn visits Earth after magic is restored in Buffy season 10 only for Willow to break up with her, saying she has grown beyond who she was when she first met Aluwyn and can't ever fully trust a trickster like her. Willow tries to say they can stay friends only for Aluwyn to threaten that Willow better hope they never see each other again. Aluwyn vanishes, enraged. =Sandy= Sandy, played by Megan Gray, first appears as a human in the Season Three episode \\"Doppelgangland\\" where she is bitten by the vampire version of Willow. While her fate in this episode is uncertain, in the Season Five episode \\"Family\\" a vampire by the same name and portrayed by the same actress shares a drink with Riley at Willy's Bar, so it is assumed to be the same character. She later reappears in the Season Five episode \\"Shadow\\" where Riley allows her to drink some of his blood, only to stake her shortly thereafter. =Satsu= Satsu is a Slayer who appears in the canonical comic book Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight, introduced in the first issue. Satsu is introduced as a member of the Slayer group stationed at the Scotland command center. She and Buffy briefly become lovers during the \\"Wolves at the Gate\\" arc; their liaison is complicated by Satsu's genuine romantic feelings for Buffy, while Buffy herself sees the relationship as a temporary (though mutually enjoyable) affair. After traveling to Tokyo and participating in the defeat a group of vampires who have stolen the legendary Dracula's powers, Satsu decides to separate herself from Buffy for her own good, and assumes leadership of the Japanese Slayer field office. She appears in Buffy season 10 to convince Buffy to work with the human military to stop demon attacks that are a global problem. Her reasoning being that Buffy can give the military another chance despite their actions in Season Eight, since she forgave Angel for his actions then. Satsu has Buffy and Spike work out an alliance between the military and the majority of the world's vampires. =Scott Hope= Scott Hope is a student at Sunnydale High who appears in Season Three, and is played by Fab Filippo. He is introduced in the episode \\"Faith, Hope & Trick\\". Buffy acknowledges Scott as a potential love interest, but is still grieving over the death of Angel in the previous season. She finally gives in after numerous advances by Scott, and they date for a short time. However, Scott breaks up with Buffy shortly before \\"Homecoming\\" because he is tired of her constant distraction. Scott is mentioned again in the Season Seven episode \\"Conversations with Dead People\\", in which Holden Webster tells Buffy that Scott spread a rumor back in high school that she was a lesbian, and has ironically come out as gay himself in college. =Severin= Severin (or the Siphon) is a major antagonist in the Season Nine comic book series. He first appears in a single panel of Season Eights final issue, where he appears \\"as a guy in John Lennon glasses who looks fairly evil\\". In Season Nine, artist Georges Jeanty models Severin's appearance on actor James McAvoy as he appears in the film X-Men: First Class.Jeanty, Georges. @SlayAliveForum I think he's modeled.... Twitter.com. 19 August 2011. In \\"Freefall\\", Season Nines opening story, many dead humans reported missing decades prior are found on the streets of San Francisco. Buffy first encounters Severin while patrolling for vampires and discovers that he has the ability to \\"drain\\" magic, turning vampires into ordinary humans, leaving them as corpses. He explains to her that he acquired this power after his girlfriend became an unexpectedly-mindless vampire, a side effect of Buffy banishing magic. After earning Buffy's trust, he lures her to a warehouse filled with vampires which he uses as batteries to \\"charge\\" him up for their fight, where he intends to drain Buffy's powers and life force. Buffy is aided in her battle by Spike and the demon Eldre Koh, who reveals that Severin is \\"the Siphon\\", the coming of which demons had long feared. Severin survives several stab wounds, but is incapacitated when SFPD officer Robert Dowling shoots him three times. In hospital, he is visited by evil Slayer Simone Doffler, who he is revealed to have been working alongside. Severin next appears in \\"Welcome to the Team\\", after the ancient demon Illyria recruits Buffy to her council of warriors who intend to stop him. Severin reveals his actions were intended to draw Illyria out so he could absorb her time travel abilities and use them to save his girlfriend. He defeats Eldre Koh and Buffy and drains Illyria of her powers leaving her alive in the appearance of Winifred Burkle. Severin and Simone approach Xander to steal the Vampyr book from Buffy, with the promise that going back in time will also save the life of Xander's girlfriend Dawn Summers who is currently dying without magic in the world. In \\"The Core\\" Xander supplies them with the information they need to enter the Deeper Well. Severin begins absorbing power from all the entombed Old Ones inside and prepares to turn back time. However, the power proves too much for him to control; he cannot reverse time and will soon be killed when he explodes with the energy. Illyria draws from her experiences with Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, who was distraught when Illyria's own resurrection destroyed his lover Fred, and convinces Severin to risk death by trying to save the world instead. Illyria stays with Severin as he tries to transfer his power into a new Seed of Wonder, which could restore magic to the whole world immediately. Severin expresses regret for his actions, but Illyria assures him he is giving the world something it needs. Severin explodes, seemingly killing himself along with the Old One Maloker and Illyria. His sacrifice restores magic to Earth and allows Willow to save Dawn. =Shannon= Shannon, played by Mary Wilcher, is a Potential Slayer who comes to Sunnydale in Season Seven. First seen in the episode \\"Dirty Girls\\", she is pursued by Bringers before being caught and critically injured by Caleb. He allows her to live so that she can deliver a message to Buffy. Her injuries leave her in the hospital, but the burn mark that Caleb left on her provides a lead for the Scooby Gang to investigate. She subsequently appears in the episodes \\"Empty Places\\" and \\"Chosen\\" where she participates in the final battle against the First Evil's army of Turok-Han vampires and is one of the survivors. =Sid the Dummy= Sid the Dummy, voiced by Tom Wyner, is a demon hunter, imprisoned in the body of a ventriloquist's dummy, who appears in the Season One episode \\"The Puppet Show\\". When a girl, Emily, is found dead with her heart removed, Buffy suspects that the culprit may be Sid, the seemingly living accessory of a student participating as a ventriloquist in the upcoming talent show. Buffy confronts Sid, who explains his past to the Scooby Gang; he was once a human demon hunter cursed into this form by a group of demons, the Brotherhood of Seven. However, as Sid's original body died long ago, Sid explains to Buffy that he will die when his curse is broken, but he has nonetheless accepted it, having already outlived most demon hunters. Having tracked the final member of the Brotherhood, who was responsible for the murder of Emily, Sid stabs the heart of the demon and kills it. Freed from his curse, Sid dies. Sid returns as a playable character in the non-canon video game Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Chaos Bleeds. He is introduced in the opening of the Cemetery level, and tells Buffy where the newly resurrected Kakistos had gone. He appears again soon after Buffy, Willow, Xander, Faith, and Spike are transported to The First Evil's home dimension. He explains that he had met The First years ago and \\"royally pissed him off\\". After his curse was broken in \\"The Puppet Show\\", the First stole his soul and placed it in a duplicate dummy body. He tells the Scooby Gang the legend of Cassandra Rayne (Ethan's ancestor, a warrior for the Powers That Be) and Hope's Dagger, the only weapon capable of harming The First. He aids them in retrieving Cassandra's eyes from Sunnydale Hospital, and stays with Ethan Rayne, unwillingly dragged along for the ride by Buffy, while the Scoobies fought The First's minions and retrieved Cassandra's body parts. After The First was defeated, he disappeared into thin air, apparently dying at long last. Humorously, Sid is initially portrayed as the stereotypical \\"horny dummy\\" act when the Scoobies believe him to be a simple dummy, only for Buffy to find out later that it is not an act. While relating his history to the stunned Scoobies (shocked at watching a dummy talk), he describes a sexual history he had in the 1930s with a Korean Slayer, even going so far as drifting out of the conversation and into the memory, later snapping out of it and saying \\"I'm back.\\" He also unsuccessfully tries to seduce Buffy, and repeatedly flirts with both Buffy and Willow. =Simone Doffler= Simone Doffler is a Slayer who moved from Rona's squad to Andrew's due to her troublesomeness, before going entirely rogue, in the comic book Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight. She sports a short mohican of dyed pink hair, and dresses in a punk or goth style. First seen in \\"The Long Way Home\\", she is seen proposing to Andrew that Slayers use guns to fight, which he dismisses, as Buffy personally dislikes guns and has made it a rule forbidding all Slayers from using them. In flashbacks in \\"The Chain\\", she is seen under Rona's squad musing about guns. In \\"A Beautiful Sunset\\", Buffy surveys video footage of Simone and a small band of Slayers in an illegal raid, and Buffy feels that Rona was simply \\"passing the buck\\" in having Simone moved to Andrew's squad in Italy. Later, in \\"Predators and Prey\\", Buffy is forced to team up with Andrew to track Simone down and confront her. Simone's criminal activities, combined with the destruction of Sunnydale, the machinations of Twilight, and Harmony Kendall's reality show Harmony Bites, have ushered in a pro-vampire, anti-Slayer world order that has forced the Scoobies and their Slayers into hiding. The last issue of Season Eight sets Simone up to be an even greater threat in Season Nine; she is depicted having infiltrated a U.S. military facility, where she kills the General who aided Twilight. In Season Nine, she appears visiting Severin in hospital, revealing she recruited him to attempt to depower Buffy. She appears in the \\"Apart (of Me)\\" where she tracks down Buffy's \\"real body\\", which has been stripped of its memories and placed into hiding by Andrew Wells without Buffy's intelligence. She first intends to interrogate and possibly kill Buffy, but is able to recruit her to her team. Buffy (in a robot body) is able to subdue and recover her real form; Spike and his crew of bugs fight Simone, sustaining heavy casualties, before she is able to escape. She next appears in \\"Welcome to the Team\\" where she is trying to create the ultimate vampire by forcing Slayers who followed her to be sired by zompires. These Slayerpires are incredibly strong but lose all intelligence. She and Severin approach Xander and request he steal Buffy's Vampyr book so Severin can turn back time to prevent the end of magic and save the lives of his girlfriend Clare and Xander's girlfriend Dawn. In \\"The Core\\" Xander supplies them with the information they need to enter the Deeper Well. Inside, Simone awakens Maloker, the Old One who created the first vampire and allows herself to be sired. She awakens having retained her intelligence but also with the added abilities of a vampire, and attacks Buffy. Simone reveals she hated being a Slayer because she had no choice but to become one and join Buffy's army. As a vampire she is proud of her choice and sees no use in having the support of others. She never believed Severin could succeed in reversing time and she never cared about saving Dawn. Simone easily knocks aside Xander and gets the upper hand against Buffy, even stabbing Buffy with the Slayer's Scythe. Simone leaves Buffy for Maloker to finish off and tries to escape the Well. As the Scoobies evacuate, Buffy expresses disgust that she made someone like Simone into a Slayer. Buffy takes back the Scythe and uses it to dust Simone. T =Mr. Trick= Mr. Trick (played by K. Todd Freeman) is a vampire who came to Sunnydale to hunt down the Slayer Faith (\\"Faith, Hope & Trick\\") with his master Kakistos, but leaves him to die at Faith and Buffy's hands, dismissing the \\"revenge gig\\" as hopelessly old-fashioned. He is an innovator who enjoys comfort and the amenities of modern occidental life, and prefers not to get his hands dirty. Mr. Trick hosts \\"SlayerFest '98\\", assembling a group of human and demonic contestants to hunt down and kill Buffy and Faith. Afterwards, he begins serving Mayor Richard Wilkins as the leader of his vampire minions. Trick hires Ethan Rayne as part of the plot to obtain the tribute that Wilkins requires to pay to the demon Lurconis (\\"Band Candy\\"), and later arranges a vampire \\"welcoming committee\\" when Spike returns to Sunnydale (\\"Lovers Walk\\"). Acting as Wilkins' middle-man, and later as his personal hitman, proves to be his undoing. Trick leads a small team of vampires to personally eliminate Buffy and Faith. He injures Buffy and has her at his mercy, but as he gloats that he will now taste a Slayer's blood, he is staked through the back by Faith. Mr. Trick survives for a few seconds, long enough to comment that something did not feel right at all, before turning to dust. Hours later, Mr. Trick's position is filled by Faith herself. (\\"Consequences\\") V =Veruca= Veruca (played by Paige Moss) is a minor character in Season Four, who appears in \\"Living Conditions\\", \\"Beer Bad\\" and \\"Wild at Heart\\". Like Oz, she is a musician and a werewolf. Oz finds himself incredibly attracted to Veruca, who tries to bring him into her philosophy of embracing the werewolf within and succumbing to its desires. As a werewolf, Oz breaks free from his cage and mates with Veruca, and later they do so again. Oz's girlfriend Willow finds out about the betrayal and is heartbroken, and Veruca targets Willow with the intention of killing her; she believes Willow prevents Oz from reaching his potential. Oz however, in his werewolf form, protects Willow and tears out Veruca's throat. Oz leaves Sunnydale following Veruca's death to find a cure for his condition. =Vi= Vi (or Violet) is a Vampire Slayer who is first introduced in the episode \\"Showtime\\", portrayed by Felicia Day. As a Potential Slayer, Vi's Watcher sent her to Buffy's for protection in Sunnydale during the war with The First Evil. She first appeared timid, often na√Øve about the supernatural. However, when she was imbued with the Slayer power, Vi displayed remarkable skill with a knife inside the Hellmouth against the Turok-Hans (\\"Chosen\\"). A couple of years later, she and Andrew Wells produced a television commercial informing recently activated Slayers about the new Watchers' Council run by Buffy (\\"The Chain\\"). Vi currently leads the New York Slayer squadron (\\"Time of Your Life\\"). W =Whistler= Whistler is an enigmatic demon who appears in Season Two, and is played by Max Perlich. He first appears in a flashback in the episode \\"Becoming, Part One\\" in which he approaches a dirty and destitute Angel on the streets of New York City. He describes his duty as maintaining the balance between good and evil, and claims that Angel is destined to be a force of good. He then takes Angel across the country to Los Angeles where he points out the young Slayer Buffy Summers as she is called to her destiny, and later at her home, where she is clearly distraught over her Slayer duties and hearing a massive argument between her parents. Seeing her allows Angel to decide to turn his life around, and to help Buffy in her duty as the Slayer. Whistler does not interfere again until he learns that Angel, now without a soul, plans to awaken the demon Acathla. He confronts Buffy and tells her that Angel was never supposed to lose his soul. In fact, it had been his destiny to stop Acathla, not bring him forth. He informs Buffy that she will have to kill Angel to stop Acathla if he is awakened, which ultimately comes to fruition. Whistler was originally supposed to appear in Angel as Angel's guide and link to the Powers That Be, but was replaced by the character Allen Francis Doyle. Whistler subsequently appeared in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight comic book \\"Riley: Commitment Through Distance, Virtue Through Sin\\" (2010) wherein he is established as Angel's confidante and guide in taking up the Twilight mantle and leading an anti-Slayer coalition. The Season Eight sequel Angel & Faith (2011‚Äì2013) features Whistler as one of its primary recurring antagonists; he wishes to restore magic to the world following Angel's betrayal of their cause in Season Eight, and is shown to be exceptionally strong. The issue \\"The Hero of His Own Story\\" (2012) depicted Whistler's origin story: the child of a demon and a servant of the Powers That Be, he was blessed with foresight by the Powers and made their agent to create an equal balance of good and evil in the world. He had expected Buffy and Angel to create a paradise in the Twilight dimension where all the good people could live happily ever after, while still maintaining balance because a few million people would die before Buffy and Angel were ready to bring the worthy ones over. Evil demons and humans would be abandoned on Earth and die when it was destroyed upon completion of the Twilight dimension and therefore free Whistler of his obligation to maintain the balance of Earth. In the present day, in a world without magic, he is separated from his power of prophecy and has become unhinged. Before the loss of magic he received a vision of a dystopian future if magic does not return to the world. In England, he works with the half-demon siblings Pearl and Nash to gather all the magical items he can to unleash a magical plague that would, at the cost of a few billion lives, transform the surviving humans into a magical species. In the final arc, \\"What You Want, Not What You Need\\" (2013), Whistler takes the energy from all the magical items and turns it into an orb of pure magic which he plans on having Pearl and Nash fly into the upper atmosphere to mutate the world. In the final battle with Angel and his team, the plague orb mutates or kills several people in the London Borough of Hackney. During their confrontation, Angel forces Whistler to absorb some of the orb's magic, which clears his addled mind. In an act of redemption, Whistler sacrifices his life to destroy the orb entirely. Before he dies, he thanks Angel for saving him from himself and says doing the right thing is more important than balance. Angel mourns the death of his mentor, and subsequently decides to stay behind in the newly christened \\"Magic Town\\" suburb of London where he anticipates there will be trouble among its mutant populace. Whistler has also appeared in the non- canonical Buffy post-Season Seven novel Queen of the Slayers, coming to Buffy in a dream to help her get back her confidence in order to defeat a rogue army of Slayers, three Hellgods, and a vampire sorcerer. =Willy the Snitch= Willy the Snitch is a bar owner and informant who appears in Seasons Two, Three, and Four, played by Saverio Guerra. Willy is a double-crossing human being, who basically follows instructions or requests if money is provided. He sometimes assists Buffy and other times betrays her. Characters, both good and bad, often beat up Willy for information. In the Season Three episode \\"Enemies\\", Xander brags about beating information out of Willy \\"personally\\", but then admits that he just bribed Willy with $28. His final appearance is in \\"Goodbye Iowa\\", when Buffy goes to his bar in an attempt to get information on the murder of a little boy. While he does not make any future appearances, dialogue in future episodes makes it clear that he still resides in Sunnydale. His bar still appears in the show but his workers are the only ones seen. In Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Chaos Bleeds, his bar appears in the Downtown Sunnydale level as the place where the player finds Spike. X =Xin Rong= Xin Rong (known in the television series only as Chinese Slayer) is a Slayer who was active in China during 1900, and is played by Ming Qiu. In the Season Two episode \\"School Hard\\", Spike brags about killing a Slayer during the Boxer Rebellion. The Slayer's first and only appearance in the television series is in the Season Five episode \\"Fool for Love\\", in which her battle with Spike in 1900 is shown in flashback. The Slayer scars Spike's left eyebrow with her sword, and comes close to staking him, but an explosion outside rocks the temple in which they are fighting, and she loses control of the situation. As she dies, she says in Chinese, \\"Tell my mother I am sorry.\\" Spike replies, \\"Sorry, love, I don't speak Chinese.\\" The Chinese Slayer appears in the Spike & Dru comic book storyline All's Fair, which gives her name as Xin Rong. In this comic, Xin's family attempts revenge by sending her brothers after Spike. They track Spike and his partner Drusilla down in Prague. In Chicago, 1933, the avengers of Xin Rong finally catch up with Spike and Dru. They beat and torture Drusilla so badly that she does not recover for ten years. The two vampires retaliate with the help of a chaos demon and the Rong family line ends there. In the Angel comic \\"Auld Lang Syne\\", the Slayer appears as a hallucination created by a demon called Lilitu to torment Spike. The Slayer's battle with Spike is recounted in the novel Spark and Burn, in which she is referred to as China Doll. According to the novel Blackout, the Chinese Slayer rescued a Buddhist monk from a dragon, for which she rewarded her with an enchanted sword. The enchantment of the sword explains why Spike's scar remains over a hundred years later, despite vampires' healing abilities. Xin Rong also briefly appears when Spike confronts the psychotic Slayer Dana, Dana's psychosis allowing her to access the memories of the Slayers that Spike has killed.

Early life Caricature by Spy (Leslie Ward) in Vanity Fair magazine (20 April 1899) Vincent was born at Slinfold, West Sussex on He was the youngest son of Sir Frederick Vincent, 11th Baronet of Stoke D'Abernon (1798‚Äì1883) and, his second wife, Maria Copley (d. 1899).Richard Davenport-Hines, 'Vincent, Edgar, Viscount D'Abernon (1857‚Äì1941)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 10 July 2011. Among his older siblings were brothers Sir William Vincent, 12th Baronet and Sir Frederick d'Abernon Vincent, 15th Baronet, whom he succeeded as 16th Baronet in 1936. He was educated at Eton College for the diplomatic service. Instead, he spent five years as a member of the Coldstream Guards before coming into the service as secretary to Lord Edmond FitzMaurice, Queen's Commissioner on the East Rumelian Question. Career Vincent was appointed Commissioner for the Evacuation of Thessaly (ceded to Greece by Turkey) and advised the Egyptian government on financial matters from 1883 to 1889. That year, he became governor of the Imperial Ottoman Bank. One of his policies was to get the Bank involved in South African mining shares on European stock exchanges. This caused a speculation craze in Constantinople where tens of thousands of people bought South African mining shares, a lot of them with money loaned from the Ottoman Bank. This led to a run on the Bank in late 1895 and then a crash in the share values, followed by an international panic and the financial ruin of many of those who invested in the shares. Vincent who personally made a fortune from the shares was heavily condemned for his role in the disaster. In 1896, the banking office in Constantinople was occupied by a group of armed Armenians who threatened to destroy the building with bombs. Vincent escaped through a skylight and notified the Turkish authorities at the Sublime Porte and secured a negotiator from the Russian Embassy. The attackers agreed to surrender their bombs in exchange for safe passage to exile in France, being conducted on Sir Edgar's private vessel.Kinross, Lord Patrick Balfour (1977) The Ottoman Centuries: The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire. New York: Morrow Quill Paperbacks. =Member of Parliament= In 1899, he was elected a Conservative Member of Parliament for Exeter. He was less a true Conservative than a personal devotee of the Conservative leader, A. J. Balfour. He held the seat until losing to a Liberal in 1906. He opposed the Conservative policy of Tariff Reform and unsuccessfully stood for the Liberal Party in Colchester in December 1910. In July 1914 he was raised to the peerage as Baron D'Abernon of Esher, Surrey, upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith. =Poland= D'Abernon was part of the Interallied Mission to Poland in July 1920, during the Polish-Soviet War. Later this experience provided material for his book The Eighteenth Decisive Battle of the World: Warsaw, 1920 (1931). =Ambassador to Germany= Monument to Edgar Vincent, 1st Viscount D'Abernon, St Mary's Church, Stoke D'Abernon, Surrey From 1920 to 1925, D'Abernon was the British Ambassador to Berlin. In September 1921 he wrote that the success of the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control, which reported on German disarmament, meant that there would be no military danger from Germany for many years and that it would be impossible for the Germans to conceal the manufacture of heavy weaponry.Lord D'Abernon, An Ambassador of Peace. Volume I (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1929), p. 14. In February 1922 he criticised the idea of a military alliance between Britain and France: > The fundamental criticism...is that England undertakes definite and very > extensive responsibilities in order to avoid a danger which she believes to > be largely imaginary. An armed attack by Germany on France within the next > twenty-five years is admittedly improbable, an attack by Germany on England > in the same period even more so...the whole tone of the French is to assume > that the real danger to the future peace of Europe is military aggression by > Germany.D'Abernon, Volume I, pp. 259‚Äì260. On 9 February 1925 D'Abernon wrote that it was necessary \\"to abandon the view that Germans are such congenital liars that there is no practical advantage in obtaining from them any engagement or declaration. On this assumption progress is impossible. Personally I regard the Germans as more reliable and more bound to written engagements than many other nations\\".Leopold Schwarzschild, World in Trance (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1943), p. 155. Lord Vansittart called D'Abernon \\"the pioneer of appeasement\\".Lord Vansittart, The Mist Procession (London: Hutchinson, 1958), p. 276. General J. H. Morgan also called D'Abernon \\"the apostle of ‚Ä≤appeasement‚Ä≤\\" and claimed D'Abernon \\"did not believe in the possibility, much less the probability, of a German military revival\\".J. H. Morgan, Assize of Arms. Being the Story of the Disarmament of Germany and Her Rearmament (1919‚Äì1939) (London: Methuen, 1945), p. 334. =Later life= After his retirement from the foreign service, D'Abernon devoted his time to directorships of numerous domestic organisations such as the Lawn Tennis Association, the Race Course Betting Control Board, the Medical Research Council, and the National Institute of Industrial Psychology, and the Royal Mint advisory committee. He was also a trustee of the National and Tate Galleries and President of the Royal Statistical Society from 1926 to 1928. Personal life D'Abernon married the renowned beauty Helen Venetia Duncombe, daughter of William Duncombe, 1st Earl of Feversham, in 1890. Together they shared a love of society and the fine arts, especially English painting. Both had portraits made by John Singer Sargent. She posed for hers in 1904 at their villa, the Palazzo Giustiniani, in Venice. Vincent was Chairman of the royal commission on National Museums and Galleries, which published its report in 1928. The bulk of their art collection was sold at auction in 1929.Old Masters Bring $646,500 in London (29 June 1929) The New York Times Two works once in their collection are in the National Gallery, three at the National Gallery of Art, Washington,National Gallery of Art, Washington and others at the (Mellon) Yale Center for British Art and other museums. The collection included 17th century Ottoman textiles. D'Abernon died of hypostatic pneumonia and Parkinson's disease at Hove in November 1941. He had no children and the viscountcy and barony created for him therefore became extinct. There were no remaining heirs to the 1620 baronetcy and that too became extinct on his death. =Honours= D'Abernon was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1887, promoted to Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) in 1917, and made Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in 1926. He joined the Privy Council in 1920. D'Abernon was elevated to the peerage as Baron D'Abernon, of Esher in the county of Surrey, in 1914 and advanced to Viscount D'Abernon, of Esher and Stoke d'Abernon in the county of Surrey, in 1926. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1934. D'Abernon succeeded his elder brother Sir Frederick D'Abernon Vincent, 15th Baronet of Stoke d'Abernon as 16th Baronet in 1936.

It was established in 1941 by Frederick Louis Maytag II.  History  The farm had a modest origin when in 1919 Elmer Henry Maytag, son of Maytag Corporation founder Frederick Louis Maytag I, purchased a single cow to provide fresh clean milk for his family. E.H. Maytag soon thereafter began to develop a small herd of champion Holstein-Friesian cows that would supply milk to his community while winning a vast number of blue ribbons at livestock shows across the United States. Within a few years of buying his first cow, E.H. Maytag had likely created the finest herd of Holstein-Friesians in the U.S. The offspring from his herd began to attract buyers from around the world. Upon E.H.‚Äôs death in 1940, his sons Fred and Robert Maytag assumed leadership of the farms. It was Fred Maytag-President & CEO of the Maytag Appliance Company who pursued his idea of creating a uniquely American blue cheese made from cow's milk. Fred collaborated with Iowa State University dairy researchers to pioneer the first great American blue cheese that would compete with classic European cheeses such as Roquefort made from sheep's milk. The cheese plant and caves were completed a year later and the first wheels of Maytag Blue Cheese were formed in October 1941. The milk from Maytag's Iowa Holsteins resulted in a rich, creamy cheese that resembled the flavors of European bleu cheeses. Ever a visionary, Fred sold his cheese in a unique new way‚Äîby catalog‚Äîessentially creating the practice of mail-ordering food that thrives today. Fred's son Fritz Maytag assumed leadership in 1962 and led the small family company for the next 50 years. During these five decades, Fritz saved from bankruptcy and imminent closure San Francisco's legendary Anchor Brewing Company and pioneered America's craft brewing movement. In the early 1980s, Fritz collaborated with his friend Peter Kump to buy James Beard's Greenwich Village townhouse and preserve it as a center for America's burgeoning culinary arts. In 2003, Fritz was awarded the James Beard Foundation Outstanding Wine, Beer or Spirits Professionalhttps://www.jamesbeard.org/awards/search?ranks%5BWinner%5D=1&year;=2003&keyword;=fritz+maytag and in 2008 won the Beard Foundation Award for Lifetime Achievementhttps://www.jamesbeard.org/awards/search?ranks%5BWinner%5D=1&year;=2008&keyword;=fritz+maytag. Fritz now serves as Chairman Emeritus and a director, along with his brother Ken Maytag and sister Martha Maytag Dannerbeck Peterson.  Present day  The cheese is still made entirely by hand in the small cheese plant that Fred constructed more than 78 years ago in the shadow of E.H.‚Äôs milking barn. The prize-winning herd is gone, but the barn remains and the company uses fresh milk from neighbor dairy farmers. The hand-formed wheels are aged for approximately six months to reach the peak of cave-ripened perfection. Maytag Dairy Farms is now owned by eleven members of the Maytag family and led by E.H.

The abbey dates back to 1123 and was once the second-wealthiest and most powerful Cistercian monastery in the country, behind Fountains Abbey, prior to its dissolution during the English Reformation.History of the abbey The abbey contains a number of individual Grade I Listed Buildings and is a Scheduled Monument. History of the abbey = Early history = The ruins of Furness Abbey's former infirmary Founded in 1123 by Stephen, Count of Boulogne, it was built originally for the Order of Savigny.Furness Abbey - Catholic Encyclopedia article Located in the 'Vale of Nightshade', south of Dalton-in-Furness, the abbey is built entirely out of local sandstone. It passed in 1147 to the Cistercians, who gradually enlarged and rebuilt the original ornate church. The majority of the current ruins date from the 12th and 13th centuries. By the 15th century, it had been completely remodelled and had become the second richest and most powerful ‚Äì as well as one of the grandest ‚Äì Cistercian abbeys in England, behind Fountains Abbey. The Gothic-style monastery and its adjacent structures cover an expansive area of land and reach a maximum height of above ground level.Skyscraper News Furness Abbey The monks of the abbey were large landowners, and the most powerful body in what was then a remote border territory. In particular, they were heavily influential on the Isle of Man. One of the kings of Mann and the Isles is buried at the abbey, as are many of the Bishops of Sodor and Man. Rushen Abbey on the Isle of Man was built on land owned by the monks.Rushen Abbey, Isle of Man , Ingram Consultancy They also owned mines on the island, and built Piel Castle to control trade between the Furness Peninsula and the Isle of Man. Being about 70 miles down the coast from Scotland, the monks occasionally found themselves in between the frequently warring Scots and English. When Robert the Bruce invaded England, during The Great Raid of 1322, the abbot paid to lodge and support him, rather than risk losing the wealth and power of the abbey. The Abbey was disestablished and destroyed in 1537 during the English Reformation under the orders of Henry VIII. = Recent history = The ruins of Furness Abbey seen from the south in the 1890s The abbey now lies in ruins and is a popular tourist attraction, lying on the Cistercian Way ‚Äì an ancient walk popular with tourists, which used to link the abbey with the nearby town of Dalton-in-Furness. William Wordsworth visited several times and referred to it in his famous 1805 autobiographical poem The Prelude, whilst J. M. W. Turner made numerous etchings of the abbey. Queen Victoria and her lady in waiting Augusta Stanley are known to have visited in 1848 based on the diaries of the latter. Other notable tourists include the Theodore Roosevelt family. It was the first unguided visit on their European tour. A young Teddy Roosevelt and his siblings played on the ruins, which, in 1869, were not roped off or restricted.David McCullough, Mornings on Horseback (NY: Simon & Schuster, 1981), 76-8 In 1896, while touring industrial Northern England, Chinese statesman Li Hongzhang visited the abbey site. Viceroy Li stayed longer than expected, so that his schedule had to be rearranged.Hunt, I. Fenty's Album 1975 p.26 photograph  Conservation and protection  The Furness Abbey complex is a Scheduled Monument and Conservation Area containing five Grade I listed buildings and structures. Restoration work took place between 2008 and 2017 amid fears that part of the abbey could have collapsed. North West Evening Mail, 1 January 2017  Folklore and supernatural activity  View looking across the former guesthouse towards the Cemetery Gatehouse and main church building There are many stories and sightings claiming that Furness Abbey is haunted. There are supposedly at least three ghosts which have been seen numerous times at the Abbey. First, it is said that the spirit of a monk has been seen climbing a staircase and also possibly walking towards the gatehouse before vanishing into a wall. Another sighting is that of a squire's daughter. She was known to meet her lover at the ruined abbey after the Reformation, although one day her partner took a journey out to sea from which he never returned. It is thought that the girl went back to the Abbey every day until her death to the site she and her partner once loved; the track she walked is today still known as \\"My Lady's Walk.\\" There have also been many sightings of a white lady, although due to possible conflicting stories, it is unclear whether the White Lady and the ghost of the squire's daughter are the same person or not. Possibly the most famous ghost of Furness Abbey is a headless monk on horseback, who rides underneath the sandstone arch near the Abbey Tavern; the death of this individual is linked to an invasion by the Scots in 1316. A tunnel is said to run underneath the Abbey to both Piel Castle and Dalton Castle, allowing the monks to receive supplies and keep watch upon the local settlements. It has also been rumoured that the Holy Grail and King John's missing jewels are hidden somewhere inside the 'Ley tunnel'.  Mystery plays  Furness Abbey has hosted a number of large-scale mystery plays. The first of these were performed over several consecutive nights in 1958. The mystery plays continued throughout the 1960s until the recruitment of participants, perhaps over 100, became difficult. Author Melvyn Bragg attended the 1988 mystery plays revival, which were the last such performances at the abbey. Prince Edward has also attended a mystery play.Furness Abbey VisitorsFurness Abbey Mystery Plays  Access and facilities  Furness Abbey is located off Manor Road close to Barrow's main thoroughfare, Abbey Road, which is named after the Abbey itself. The Abbey also lies next to the Furness Line and was served by Furness Abbey railway station until closure in 1950. The closest stations are now Roose and Dalton. English Heritage operates a small visitor centre at Furness Abbey which includes a number of stone carvings and effigies as well as a gift shop. It, alongside the abbey is open to the public between 10am and 6pm daily, although this is restricted to 10am to 4pm on weekends within the winter/spring season. Free passes are available for English Heritage members as well as local residents, while standard visitor entry in 2018 is ¬£5.70 per adult.

The supporting cast includes Bernard Miles, Leslie Phillips, Francis de Wolff, George Cross, June Cunningham and Sid James. The screenplay was written by William Rose and John Eldridge from an original story by William Rose. Plot Matt and Jean (Travers and McKenna) are a young couple with a longing to visit exotic places such as Samarkand. Matt inherits a cinema from his great uncle. When they look over their new property, they first mistake the modern Grand for it. They are soon disillusioned to learn that the cinema they actually own is the old decrepit Bijou Kinema (nicknamed \\"the flea pit\\"), which is sandwiched between two railway bridges. Along with the cinema come three long-time employees: Mrs. Fazackalee (Rutherford), the cashier and bookkeeper; Mr. Quill (Sellers), the projectionist; and Old Tom (Miles) the commissionaire, doorkeeper and usher. Robin (Phillips), their solicitor, informs them that the Grand's owner, Mr. Hardcastle (De Wolff), had offered to buy the Bijou from Matt's great uncle for five thousand pounds in order to construct a car park for his nearby cinema. When they see their competitor however, he only offers them five hundred, thinking they have no choice but to accept. Instead, on Robin's advice, they pretend to want to reopen the Bijou in order to force Hardcastle to raise his offer. At first, they seem to be succeeding, but then Old Tom inadvertently lets slip their overheard plan and Hardcastle refuses to budge. They decide to carry on with their bluff and go through with the opening. After a few mishaps, the business flourishes, especially after Matt employs the curvaceous Marlene Hogg (Cunningham) to sell ice creams and other treats at the interval. To increase sales, the heat in the theater was turned up during the showing of a film where parched actors crawled across a desert. Hardcastle counters by slipping a bottle of whisky into the next shipment of film reels for Quill, who has a drink problem. He eventually succumbs to the temptation, leaving Matt to try unsuccessfully to substitute for him; Matt is unable to work the antiquated projectors properly, and they are forced to refund the customers' money. Matt and Jean are ready to give up (with Old Tom eavesdropping again, this time hearing Matt say that he had often wished the Grand were burnt to the ground) only to wake up the next morning to find that the Grand has burned down (Old Tom was last seen carrying a can of fuel oil out of the door). Hardcastle is forced to pay ten thousand pounds for the Bijou in order to stay in business while his cinema is being rebuilt. As an added condition, he has to keep the three staff on as employees. Just as Matt and Jean are leaving on the train, Old Tom tells Matt that \\"It were the only way, weren't it?\\", implying he committed arson. Alarmed, they decide to write him a letter asking him to clarify his remark, but instead send him a postcard... from Samarkand.

The exterior facade was constructed between two railway bridges in Christchurch Avenue, London NW6, next to Kilburn tube station. A replica at Shepperton Studios was used for close-up shots and interior scenes. The Gaumont Palace, Hammersmith in London (subsequently called the Hammersmith Odeon, and now the Hammersmith Apollo) was used for the exterior shots of the rival Grand Cinema with interiors at the Odeon in Richmond. Back projection shots of Longton, Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire were used for the final scenes in the railway carriage. The silent film shown in the film is Comin' Thro the Rye (1923) starring Alma Taylor. Taylor is among the uncredited viewers in the audience. Critical reception The New York Times called it \\"a little package of nonsense...populated by wonderfully wacky characters...Margaret Rutherford's cashier, Peter Sellers' projectionist and Bernard Miles' doorman are gems\\"; Leonard Maltin called it a \\"Charming, often hilarious comedy\\"; and a modern review in the Radio Times wrote, \\"In praise of fleapits everywhere, this charming comedy will bring back happy memories for anyone who pines for the days when going to the pictures meant something more than being conveyor-belted in and out of a soulless multiplex...The cast alone makes the movie a must-see, and the sequence in which projectionist Peter Sellers, pianist Margaret Rutherford and doorman Bernard Miles relive the glories of the silent era is adorable.\\" References External links 1957 films 1957 comedy films British comedy films British films British black-and-white films Films directed by Basil Dearden Films set in a movie theatre Films scored by William Alwyn ","title":"The Smallest Show on Earth"},{"id":"1362027","text":"Chung Mong-koo (born March 19, 1938, in Gangwon Province) is a South Korean business magnate who is the chairman and CEO of Hyundai Motor Group.

Chung succeeded his father, Chung Ju-yung, the founder of the conglomerate known as the Hyundai Group. When the conglomerate split into several parts in 1999, Chung Mong-koo took over the Hyundai Motor division. He is the eldest surviving son of Chung Ju-yung's eight sons.

Controversies = 2007 embezzlement conviction = In 2006, he and his family were targeted by the Seoul Supreme Prosecutor's Office as part of an investigation into embezzling 100 billion won ($106 million) from Hyundai to create slush funds to bribe officials. Despite a travel ban, Chung left South Korea in April 2006. Chung was arrested on 28 April 2006 on charges related to embezzlement and other corruption. On 5 February 2007 he was convicted of embezzlement and breach of fiduciary duty for selling securities to his son Chung Eui-sun at below-market prices. He was sentenced to three years in prison. Chung remained free on bail while he appealed the sentence. On September 6, 2007, Chief Judge Lee Jae-hong ruled to suspend the sentence of Chung Mong-koo (in consideration of the huge economic impact of imprisonment), ordering instead of a 3-year jail term, community service and a $1 billion donation to charity. The trial was seen as \\"a victory for transparency and rule of law in South Korea\\", but on August 15, 2008, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak granted him a special pardon to allow Chung to continue to contribute to the development of Hyundai Motor Group as well as the Korean economy. =Nepotism= His only son Chung Eui-sun is his \\"heir apparent\\", despite his relatively unproven business and leadership skills.

The R groups may be the same or different alkyl or aryl groups. Also, the R groups may be connected. Quaternary ammonium cations, also known as quats, are positively charged polyatomic ions of the structure , R being an alkyl group or an aryl group. Unlike the ammonium ion () and the primary, secondary, or tertiary ammonium cations, the quaternary ammonium cations are permanently charged, independent of the pH of their solution. Quaternary ammonium salts or quaternary ammonium compounds (called quaternary amines in oilfield parlance) are salts of quaternary ammonium cations. Polyquats are a variety of engineered polymer forms which provide multiple quat molecules within a larger molecule. \\"Top\\" view of one view of Bu4N+ as determined by X-ray crystallography. \\"Side\\" view of Bu4N+ as determined by X-ray crystallography.  Synthesis  Quaternary ammonium compounds are prepared by the alkylation of tertiary amines with a halocarbon. In older literature this is often called a Menshutkin reaction, however modern chemists usually refer to it simply as quaternization. The reaction can be used to produce a compound with unequal alkyl chain lengths; for example when making cationic surfactants one of the alkyl groups on the amine is typically longer than the others. A typical synthesis is for benzalkonium chloride from a long- chain alkyldimethylamine and benzyl chloride: :CH3(CH2)nN(CH3)2 \\\\+ ClCH2C6H5 ‚Üí [CH3(CH2)nN(CH3)2CH2C6H5]+Cl‚àí Reactions Quaternary ammonium cations are unreactive toward even strong electrophiles, oxidants, and acids. They also are stable toward most nucleophiles. The latter is indicated by the stability of the hydroxide salts such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide. Because of their resilience, many unusual anions have been isolated as the quaternary ammonium salts. Examples include tetramethylammonium pentafluoroxenate, containing the highly reactive pentafluoroxenate () ion. Permanganate can be solubilized in organic solvents, when deployed as its salt. With exceptionally strong bases, quat cations degrade. They undergo Sommelet‚ÄìHauser rearrangement and Stevens rearrangement, as well as dealkylation under harsh conditions or in presence of strong nucleophiles, like thiolates. Quaternary ammonium cations containing N‚ÄìC‚ÄìC‚ÄìH units can also undergo the Hofmann elimination and Emde degradation. Benzalkonium chloride is a common type of quat salt used as a biocide, a cationic surfactant, and as a phase transfer agent. ADBACs are a mixture of alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chlorides, in which the alkyl group has various even-numbered alkyl chain lengths. Applications Quaternary ammonium salts are used as disinfectants, surfactants, fabric softeners, and as antistatic agents (e.g. in shampoos). In liquid fabric softeners, the chloride salts are often used. In dryer anticling strips, the sulfate salts are often used. Older aluminium electrolytic capacitors and spermicidal jellies also contain quaternary ammonium salts. =As antimicrobials= Quaternary ammonium compounds have also been shown to have antimicrobial activity. Certain quaternary ammonium compounds, especially those containing long alkyl chains, are used as antimicrobials and disinfectants. Examples are benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, methylbenzethonium chloride, cetalkonium chloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimonium, cetrimide, dofanium chloride, tetraethylammonium bromide, didecyldimethylammonium chloride and domiphen bromide. Also good against fungi, amoebas, and enveloped viruses, quaternary ammonium compounds are believed to act by disrupting the cell membrane or viral envelope. Quaternary ammonium compounds are lethal to a wide variety of organisms except endospores, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-enveloped viruses. Quaternary ammonium compounds are cationic detergents, as well as disinfectants, and as such can be used to remove organic material. They are very effective in combination with phenols. Quaternary ammonium compounds are deactivated by anionic detergents (including common soaps). Also, they work best in soft waters. Effective levels are at 200 ppm. They are effective at temperatures up to . Quaternary ammonium salts are commonly used in the foodservice industry as sanitizing agents. =Phase transfer catalysts= In organic chemistry, quaternary ammonium salts are employed as phase transfer catalysts (PTCs). Such catalysts accelerate reactions between reagents dissolved in immiscible solvents. The highly reactive reagent dichlorocarbene is generated via PTC by reaction of chloroform and aqueous sodium hydroxide. Anion exchange resins, in the form of beads, contain quaternary ammonium ions bound to a polymer. =Fabric softeners and hair conditioners= In the 1950s, distearyldimethylammonium chloride (DHTDMAC), was introduced as a fabric softener. This compound was discontinued because the cation biodegrades too slowly. Contemporary fabric softeners are based on salts of quaternary ammonium cations where the fatty acid is linked to the quaternary center via ester linkages; these are commonly referred to as betaine-esters or ester- quats and are susceptible to degradation, e.g., by hydrolysis. Characteristically, the cations contain one or two long alkyl chains derived from fatty acids linked to an ethoxylated ammonium salt. Other cationic compounds can be derived from imidazolium, guanidinium, substituted amine salts, or quaternary alkoxy ammonium salts. File:C18x2Me2Cl.pngDistearyldimethylammonium chloride, an early generation fabric softener with low biodegradability that was phased out. File:Redrawn diesterquat salt (methanesulfonate anion) related to fabric softeners.pngAnother diesterquat, a contemporary fabric softener. File:AltDiesterquatCl.pngDiethyl ester dimethyl ammonium chloride used as a fabric softener. File:DiesterCl.pngAnother diesterquat used as a fabric softener. The antistatic qualities that make quaternary ammonium salts useful as fabric softeners also make them useful in hair conditioners and shampoos. The idea was pioneered by Henkel with a 1984 patent. Examples include cetrimonium chloride and behentrimonium chloride.What is cetrimonium chloride? at naturallycurly.com =Plant growth retardants= Cycocel (chlormequat chloride) reduces plant height by inhibiting the production of gibberellins, the primary plant hormones responsible for cell elongation. Therefore, their effects are primarily on stem, petiole and flower stalk tissues. Lesser effects are seen in reductions of leaf expansion, resulting in thicker leaves with darker green color. Wageningen Agricultural University, The Netherlands Natural occurrence Glycine betaine, found in osmolytes, stabilizes osmotic pressure in cells. left Choline is a quat compound. Choline is a precursor for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Choline is also a constituent of lecithin, which is present in many plants and animal organs. It is found in phospholipids. For example, phosphatidylcholines, a major component of biological membranes, are a member of the lecithin group of fatty substances in animal and plant tissues. Carnitine participates in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. 1-Oleoyl-2-palmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine  Health effects  Quaternary ammonium compounds can display a range of health effects, amongst which are mild skin and respiratory irritation up to severe caustic burns on skin and the gastrointestinal wall (depending on concentration), gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea and vomiting), coma, convulsions, hypotension and death.Quaternary ammonium (PIM G022) They are thought to be the chemical group responsible for anaphylactic reactions that occur with use of neuromuscular blocking drugs during general anaesthesia in surgery. Quaternium-15 is the single most often found cause of allergic contact dermatitis of the hands (16.5% in 959 cases) =Possible reproductive effects in laboratory animals= Quaternary ammonium-based disinfectants (Virex and Quatricide) were tentatively identified as the most probable cause of jumps in birth defects and fertility problems in caged lab mice. The quat ingredients in the disinfectants include alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (ADBAC) and didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DDAC). A similar link was tentatively identified in nurses. The studies contradict earlier toxicology data reviewed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and the EU Commission. =Quantification= The quantification of quaternary ammonium compounds in environmental and biological samples is problematic using conventional chromatography techniques because the compounds are highly soluble in water. While analyzing them by liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry it has been found that they follow an exception rule. Under standard electrospray ionization (ESI) conditions, mono- and di-quaternary ammonium compounds form molecular ions with the formula of ' rather than . Formation of is observed for di-quaternary ammonium compounds (like diquat) as precursor ion and as product ion due to the loss of one of the quaternary charge during CID. In di-quaternary ammonium compounds, this process can also result in the formation of fragment ions with higher mass as compared to their precursor ion. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographic separation has been reported to demonstrate a successful separation of quaternary ammonium compounds for their quantification in ESI-MS/MS with higher precision.

The Cotton Genesis (London, British Library, MS Cotton Otho B VI) is a 4th- or 5th-century Greek Illuminated manuscript copy of the Book of Genesis. It was a luxury manuscript with many miniatures. It is one of the oldest illustrated biblical codices to survive to the modern period. Most of the manuscript was destroyed in the Cotton library fire in 1731, leaving only eighteen charred, shrunken scraps of vellum. From the remnants, the manuscript appears to have been more than 440 pages with approximately 340-360 illustrations that were framed and inserted into the text column. Many miniatures were also copied in the 17th century and are now in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris (Ms. fr. 9530). Joseph with his brethren in his own house, on their return into Egypt; illustration to Genesis 43:30-31; from the facsimile Horne's edition (1852)  Description  The manuscript contains the text of the Book of Genesis on 35 parchment leaves (size about 27 x 22 cm), with numerous lacunae.Alfred Rahlfs, Verzeichnis der griechischen Handschriften des Alten Testaments, f√ºr das Septuaginta-Unternehmen, G√∂ttingen 1914, pp. 107-108. The original codex contained 165 leaves, in the quarto size. It is written in uncial letters, in one column per page, in 27-30 letters per line. The nomina sacra usually are written in an abbreviated forms: ŒöŒ£, ŒöŒù, ŒòŒ£, ŒòŒù, for Œ∫œÖœÅŒπŒøœÇ, Œ∫œÖœÅŒπŒøŒΩ, Œ∏ŒµŒøœÇ, Œ∏ŒµŒøŒΩ. It contains some illustrations (e.g. Joseph with his brethren in his own house, on their return into Egypt). The miniatures were executed in a late antique style, retaining classical illusionistic qualities. Herbert L. Kessler and Kurt Weitzmann argue that the manuscript was produced in Alexandria, as it exhibits stylistic similarities to other Alexandrian works such as the Charioteer Papyrus.  History of the codex  According to Tischendorf it was written in the 5th century.Tischendorf, K.v., Monumenta sacra inedita (Leipzig 1857), XIII. The Cotton Genesis appears to have been used in the 1220s as the basis for the design of 110 mosaic panels in the atrium of St Mark's Basilica in Venice, presumably after it was brought to Venice following the sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. It was brought from Philippi by two Greek bishops, who presented it to King Henry VIII, whom they informed that tradition reported it to have been the identical copy which had belonged to Origen.Thomas Hartwell Horne, An introduction to the critical study of the Holy Scriptures (New York 1852), Volume 1, p. 226. The manuscript was acquired by Sir Robert Cotton in the 17th century. His collection passed to the British Museum. In 1731, while the codex was at Ashburnham House with the rest of the collection, it was reduced by fire to a heap of charred and shrivelled leaves. Afterwards the rest of the codex was divided in two parts. One part of it (29 folios) was moved to the British Museum, another to the Bodleian Library. Until the middle of the 19th century it was thought to be the oldest manuscript of the Septuagint. According to Thomas Hartwell Horne it was not only the most ancient but the most correct manuscript that is extant.Th. H. Horne, An Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge if the Holy Scriptures (New York 1852), p. 236 According to Swete the manuscript even before the fire had been imperfect. Most of the London fragments of the codex were deciphered and published by Constantin von Tischendorf in 1857;Tischendorf, Kv., Monumenta sacra inedita (Leipzig 1857), nov. coll.

He is modeled after John E. Douglas, who held the same position. Red Dragon Jack Crawford first appears in the novel Red Dragon, in which he calls upon Will Graham, his former prot√©g√©, for assistance in solving the murders being committed by a serial killer dubbed \\"The Tooth Fairy.\\" Graham, as a profiler, has a reputation for being able to think like the criminals whom he hunts, thus assisting the FBI in a criminal's ultimate apprehension. Graham had retired after being attacked and nearly killed by Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a Baltimore psychiatrist who had previously treated the victim of a murder that Graham was investigating, after Graham intuited that Lecter was the killer he sought. Crawford convinces Graham to come out of retirement to help solve the \\"Tooth Fairy\\" murders, and soon they both realize that they would need Lecter's help again. Crawford helps shelter Graham and his family after Lecter sends the killer, Francis Dolarhyde, his old nemesis' address. With Crawford's help, Graham eventually solves the case, but Dolarhyde disfigures him before Graham's wife kills him. Crawford feels responsible for Graham's misfortune, and resents Lecter for the rest of his life. The Silence of the Lambs Jack Crawford appears again in the novel The Silence of the Lambs, again investigating a serial killer. This time, the serial killer is called \\"Buffalo Bill\\", and his killing signature involves killing and skinning women. Crawford is stumped in trying to determine who Buffalo Bill is, and is forced to once again call upon Lecter for assistance. This time, however, Crawford sends an FBI trainee, Clarice Starling, to interview him. By way of information obtained from Lecter, Crawford and the FBI attempt to track down the killer, Jame Gumb. However, the address they obtain for him is out of date. Gumb had killed the employer of one of his former victims and moved into her house to use its large basement, which contains a disused and empty well. He uses the well as a makeshift holding space for his victims. Realizing that Buffalo Bill probably knew his first victim, Fredrica Bimmel, Starling sets about interviewing everyone close to her and ends up stumbling upon Gumb's house. By the time local police and firemen arrive to help, Starling has singlehandedly killed Gumb and rescued his intended victim. Throughout the novel, Crawford is struggling under a double burden, as he is caring for his terminally ill wife, Bella, at home while leading the investigation into the 'Buffalo Bill' case. Bella dies near the end of the novel. Hannibal Crawford appears as a relatively minor character in the book Hannibal. He is portrayed as very sympathetic toward Starling, yet increasingly distant due to failing health and his powerlessness against the corrupt bureaucrats set to destroy her career. Late in the novel, Crawford is forced into leave from the FBI, and soon dies of a heart attack. Film and television adaptations The Crawford character appears in the film adaptations of Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs; he does not appear in the adaptation of Hannibal, although a deleted scene explains that he has died. He has been portrayed by four different actors: * Dennis Farina in Manhunter, the 1986 film adaptation of Red Dragon. * Scott Glenn in The Silence of the Lambs. ::In the supplemental section on the special edition DVD of The Silence of the Lambs, Scott Glenn revealed that he was given an audio tape by FBI agent John Douglas as a form of research for his character. The tape was an audio recording serial killers Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris had made of themselves raping and torturing a 16-year- old girl as they drove around Los Angeles.CrimeLibrary.com. p. 10 Upon questioning Douglas as to his motives for presenting these tapes, Douglas simply said to Glenn, \\"Now you are part of my world.\\" This experience preyed upon Glenn's mind all throughout filming, and he refused to return to the role in Hannibal because he didn't want to place himself in such a mindset again. To this day, he says that the tapes still cause him anxiety and bad dreams.Saxon, Edward, Demme, Jonathan.1991. The Silence of the Lambs. United States: Orion Pictures. * Harvey Keitel in the 2002 adaptation of Red Dragon, which uses the novel's original title. * Laurence Fishburne in the television adaptation Hannibal. =Hannibal television series storyline= The TV series portrays Crawford as deliberately pushing the limits of Graham's sanity in order to fully exploit his proteg√©'s gift for profiling serial killers. At the end of the first season, he reluctantly arrests Graham after finding evidence that he is the serial killer known as \\"The Chesapeake Ripper\\"; he is unaware that Lecter had framed Graham. When Graham is exonerated in the second season, Crawford helps him with an elaborate plan to entrap and capture Lecter, which puts Crawford's career in jeopardy when his superiors at the FBI learn of it. In the second season finale, Crawford attempts to arrest Lecter, but Lecter escapes after severely injuring him. The third season reveals that Crawford survives his injuries, but is forced into retirement from the FBI. At about this time, Crawford's wife, Bella, dies of lung cancer. He tracks down Lecter in Florence, Italy, and engages him in brutal hand-to-hand combat. Lecter escapes and later forces Crawford to watch as he prepares to perform a craniotomy on Graham. They are interrupted by corrupt Italian detectives working for Lecter's surviving victim Mason Verger, who take Graham and Lecter away to Verger's estate. After Lecter and Graham escape from Verger's clutches, Crawford‚Äîwho has been reinstated by the FBI‚Äîgoes to Graham's house, where Lecter voluntarily surrenders to him. Three years later, Crawford asks Graham, who has retired from the FBI, to help catch a serial killer dubbed \\"The Tooth Fairy\\" who kills entire families. Along with Graham and Dr. Alana Bloom, Crawford arranges to use Lecter as bait for the killer, Francis Dolarhyde. Following Lecter's subsequent escape, a cut epilogue shows Crawford continuing to hunt for him.

They consist of aluminium and chlorine atoms in a 1:3 ratio, and one form also contains six waters of hydration. Both are white solids, but samples are often contaminated with iron(III) chloride, giving a yellow color. The anhydrous material is important commercially. It has a low melting and boiling point. It is mainly produced and consumed in the production of aluminium metal, but large amounts are also used in other areas of the chemical industry. The compound is often cited as a Lewis acid. It is an example of an inorganic compound that reversibly changes from a polymer to a monomer at mild temperature. Uses =Alkylation and acylation of arenes= AlCl3 is a common Lewis-acid catalyst for Friedel‚ÄìCrafts reactions, both acylations and alkylations. Important products are detergents and ethylbenzene. These types of reactions are the major use for aluminium chloride, for example, in the preparation of anthraquinone (used in the dyestuffs industry) from benzene and phosgene. In the general Friedel‚ÄìCrafts reaction, an acyl chloride or alkyl halide reacts with an aromatic system as shown: :330px The alkylation reaction is more widely used than the acylation reaction, although its practice is more technically demanding. For both reactions, the aluminium chloride, as well as other materials and the equipment, should be dry, although a trace of moisture is necessary for the reaction to proceed. Detailed procedures are available for alkylation and acylation of arenes. A general problem with the Friedel‚ÄìCrafts reaction is that the aluminium chloride catalyst sometimes is required in full stoichiometric quantities, because it complexes strongly with the products. This complication sometimes generates a large amount of corrosive waste. For these and similar reasons, the use of aluminium chloride has often been displaced by zeolites. Aluminium chloride can also be used to introduce aldehyde groups onto aromatic rings, for example via the Gattermann-Koch reaction which uses carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride and a copper(I) chloride co-catalyst.Wade, L. G. (2003) Organic Chemistry, 5th edition, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, United States. . :300px =Other applications in organic and organometallic synthesis= Aluminium chloride finds a wide variety of other applications in organic chemistry.Galatsis, P. (1999) Handbook of Reagents for Organic Synthesis: Acidic and Basic Reagents, H. J. Reich, J. H. Rigby (eds.) Wiley, New York City. pp. 12‚Äì15. . For example, it can catalyse the \\"ene reaction\\", such as the addition of 3-buten-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone) to carvone: :400px It is used to induce a variety of hydrocarbon couplings and rearrangements. Aluminium chloride combined with aluminium in the presence of an arene can be used to synthesize bis(arene) metal complexes, e.g. bis(benzene)chromium, from certain metal halides via the so-called Fischer-Hafner synthesis. Dichlorophenylphosphine is prepared by reaction of benzene and phosphorus trichloride catalyzed by aluminium chloride. Structure =Anhydrous= AlCl3 adopts three structures, depending on the temperature and the state (solid, liquid, gas). Solid AlCl3 is a sheet-like layered cubic close packed layers. In this framework, the Al centres exhibit octahedral coordination geometry.In contrast, AlBr3 has a more molecular structure, with the Al3+ centers occupying adjacent tetrahedral holes of the close-packed framework of Br‚àí ions. Wells, A. F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry, Oxford Press, Oxford, United Kingdom. . When aluminium trichloride is in its melted state, it exists as the dimer Al2Cl6, with tetracoordinate aluminium. This change in structure is related to the lower density of the liquid phase (1.78 g/cm3) versus solid aluminium trichloride (2.48 g/cm3). Al2Cl6 dimers are also found in the vapour phase. At higher temperatures, the Al2Cl6 dimers dissociate into trigonal planar AlCl3, which is structurally analogous to BF3. The melt conducts electricity poorly, unlike more-ionic halides such as sodium chloride. 500px Aluminium chloride monomer belongs to the point group D3h in its monomeric form and D2h in its dimeric form. =Hexahydrate= The hexahydrate consists of octahedral [Al(H2O)6]3+ centers and chloride counterions. Hydrogen bonds link the cation and anions. The hydrated form of aluminium chloride has an octahedral molecular geometry, with the central aluminum ion surrounded by six water ligand molecules. Being coordinatively saturated, the hydrate is of little value as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation and related reactions. Reactions Anhydrous aluminium chloride is a powerful Lewis acid, capable of forming Lewis acid-base adducts with even weak Lewis bases such as benzophenone and mesitylene. It forms tetrachloroaluminate (AlCl4‚àí) in the presence of chloride ions. Aluminium chloride reacts with calcium and magnesium hydrides in tetrahydrofuran forming tetrahydroaluminates. =Reactions with water= Anhydrous aluminium chloride is hygroscopic, having a very pronounced affinity for water. It fumes in moist air and hisses when mixed with liquid water as the Cl‚àí ligands are displaced with H2O molecules to form the hexahydrate [Al(H2O)6]Cl3 . The anhydrous phase cannot be regained on heating the hexahydrate. Instead HCl is lost leaving aluminium hydroxide or alumina (aluminium oxide): : Al(H2O)6Cl3 ‚Üí Al(OH)3 \\\\+ 3 HCl + 3 H2O Like metal aquo complexes, aqueous AlCl3 is acidic owing to the ionization of the aquo ligands: : [Al(H2O)6]3+ ‚áå [Al(OH)(H2O)5]2+ \\\\+ H+ Aqueous solutions behave similarly to other aluminium salts containing hydrated Al3+ ions, giving a gelatinous precipitate of aluminium hydroxide upon reaction with dilute sodium hydroxide: : AlCl3 \\\\+ 3 NaOH ‚Üí [Al(OH)3] + 3 NaCl Synthesis Aluminium chloride is manufactured on a large scale by the exothermic reaction of aluminium metal with chlorine or hydrogen chloride at temperatures between . :2 Al + 3 Cl2 ‚Üí 2 AlCl3 :2 Al + 6 HCl ‚Üí 2 AlCl3 \\\\+ 3 H2 Aluminum chloride may be formed via a single displacement reaction between copper chloride and aluminum metal. :2 Al + 3 CuCl2 ‚Üí 2 AlCl3 \\\\+ 3 Cu In the US in 1993, approximately 21,000 tons were produced, not counting the amounts consumed in the production of aluminium. Hydrated aluminium trichloride is prepared by dissolving aluminium oxides in hydrochloric acid. Metallic aluminum also readily dissolves in hydrochloric acid ‚îÄ releasing hydrogen gas and generating considerable heat. Heating this solid does not produce anhydrous aluminium trichloride, the hexahydrate decomposes to aluminium hydroxide when heated: :Al(H2O)6Cl3 ‚Üí Al(OH)3 \\\\+ 3 HCl + 3 H2O Aluminium also forms a lower chloride, aluminium(I) chloride (AlCl), but this is very unstable and only known in the vapour phase. Safety Anhydrous AlCl3 reacts vigorously with bases, so suitable precautions are required.

Most of it falls under the jurisdiction of Girardot Municipality. The population of Maracay and its surroundings in the 2011 census was 955,362. In Venezuela, Maracay is known as \\"Ciudad Jard√≠n\\" (\\"Garden City\\").  History  Monumento en honor al General Juan Vicente G√≥mez The jaguar, symbol of the Maracaya Indians Venus de Tacarigua, another symbol of Maracay Officially established on March 5, 1701 by Bishop Diego de Ba√±os y Sotomayor in the valleys of Tocopio and Tapatapa (what is known today as the central valley of Aragua) in northern Venezuela. According to the most accepted explanation, it was named after a local indigenous chief, and refers to the \\"Maracayo\\" (Felis mitis), a small tiger. Alternative etymologies cite a local aromatic tree called Mara. Maracay experienced rapid growth during Juan Vicente G√≥mez's dictatorship (1908‚Äì1935). G√≥mez saw Maracay as a suitable place to make his residence during his rule, and ordered the construction of an Arc of Triumph, a bull plaza (a near replica of the one in Seville, Spain), an √ìpera house, a Zoo, and, most notably, the Hotel Jard√≠n (Garden Hotel), a majestic, tourist attraction with very large gardens. The city is home to the Mausoleo de G√≥mez (G√≥mez's mausoleum), where the dictator's remains are stored.  Economy and transport  One of the most important cities in Venezuela, Maracay is primarily an industrial and commercial center, the city produces paper, textiles chemicals, tobacco, cement, cattle, processed foods, soap, and perfumes. The areas around Maracay are agricultural: sugarcane, tobacco, coffee and cocoa stand out as the main products. There are also cattle-herding and timber-cutting activities. Activity by the Venezuelan Military also adds a great deal to Maracay's economy. Maracay has good transportation facilities and infrastructure. The city is linked to most other important localities by the Autopista Regional del Centro (Central Regional Highway). It also has good access to Venezuela's small national railway system. The city boasts the national Hidroplane airport, located on the shore of the Lago de Valencia (Lake of Valencia). The city does not have a subway system, but one is in the planning stages. Maracay has two airports. The Airport Mariscal Sucre (IATA MCY ICAO SVBS) and the military Air Base El Libertador (IATA MYC ICAO SVBL)  Military  Maracay is a city heavily influenced by the military. Maracay is the cradle of Venezuelan aviation, and it is home to the two largest Air Force bases in the country. The Venezuelan F-16 fighter planes are stationed here, as well as the new Sukhoi-30MKEs acquired by the Venezuelan Government. Other military facilities include the Fourth Armored Division of the Army and the Venezuelan Paratroopers main base and training center. It is also home to the government-owned ammunition and weapons factory (CAVIM) that produces the Venezuelan version of the FN FAL (Fusil Automatique Leger - Light Automatic Rifle) rifle and the AK-103s; as well as the ammunition for both models. Section of the Henri Pittier National Park as seen from a hill.  Natural reserves  The mountains on the north side of Maracay, that separate it from the coast, make up the Henri Pittier National Park, named after the Swiss naturalist that studied them. The park is a very lush rainforest, with a great variety of ferns. Two very winding roads cut through the park over the mountains to the coast. One, beginning at the North-Central part of the city known as Urbanizaci√≥n El Casta√±o, goes to the beach town of Choron√≠. The other, beginning at the North-Western part at the city of El Lim√≥n, goes to Ocumare de la Costa and the beaches of Cata and Cuyagua.

The monastery was consecrated to the Feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos, for which cause it was sometimes referred to as the Dormition Monastery of St. Cyril. By the 20th century, the town of Kirillov had grown nearby.  History  A 1897 view The monastery was founded in 1397 on the bank of Lake Siverskoye, to the south of the town of Beloozero, in the present-day Vologda Oblast. Its founder, St. Cyril or Kirill of Beloozero, following the advice of his teacher, St. Sergius of Radonezh, first dug a cave here, then built a wooden Dormition chapel and a loghouse for other monks. Shortly before the creation of the monastery, the area fell under the control of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Being a member of the influential Velyaminov clan of boyars, Kirill relinquished the office of father superior of the greatest cloister in medieval Moscow, the Simonov monastery. His close ties with the ruling elite can be convincingly demonstrated by his letters to sons of Dmitri Donskoi. It seems that the Muscovite rulers regarded Kirill's monastery as an important strategic point, both for Northern trade and in their struggle with the Novgorod Republic. By 1427, when Kirill died, the prince of Belozersk-Mozhaisk (subject to the Grand Prince of Moscow) was the monastery's patron, and the monastery was administratively subordinate to the Archbishop of Rostov. Under Hegumen Trifon (1434/5‚Äì1447/8), social and administrative reforms were undertaken, including the adoption of an Athonite cenobitic rule. A Byzantine-style secondary school was established at which translations of textbooks on grammar, semantics, geography, and history were used. A lasting legacy of the school were bibliographical studies, exemplified by the elder Yefrosin, and text-critical studies, exemplified by Nil Sorsky (1433‚Äì1508). Nil also founded a skete on the Sora River near the monastery. In the 16th century, the monastery was the second richest landowner in Russia, after its model, the Trinity Monastery near Moscow. Ivan the Terrible not only had his own cell in the cloister, but also planned to take monastic vows here. The cloister was also important as a political prison. Among the Muscovite politicians exiled to Kirillov were Vassian Patrikeyev, Tsar Simeon Bekbulatovich, Patriarch Nikon, and the prime minister Boris Morozov. In December 1612, the monastery was besieged by Polish-Lithuanian vagabonds, the Lisowczycy, who failed to capture it.  Attractions  The vast walled area of the monastery comprises two separate priories with eleven churches, most of them dating to the 16th century. Of these, nine belong to the Uspensky (Dormition, the Orthodox equivalent of the Catholic holiday known as the Assumption of Mary) priory by the lake. The Dormition cathedral, erected by Rostov masters in 1497, was the largest monastery church built in Russia up to that date. Its 17th-century iconostasis features many ancient icons, arranged in five tiers above a silver heaven gate endowed by Tsar Alexis in 1645. A lot of valuable objects kept in the sacristy are personal gifts of the tsars who visited the monastery. View from one of the monastery towers. The smaller Ivanovsky priory is dedicated to St. John the Precursor, the patron saint of Ivan the Terrible. The oldest church of the priory was commissioned by Ivan's father, for the benefit of the \\"mendicant brethren,\\" soon after his visit to the monastery in 1528. Subsequently, the monks incurred the tsar's displeasure by constructing St. Vladimir's Chapel over the grave of the exiled Prince Vorotynsky. Although the tsar chastised them for having broken canonical requirements, the chapel ‚Äî which became the first family mausoleum in Russia ‚Äî survived Ivan's reign and was expanded to its present form in 1623. The monastery walls, 732 meters long and 7 meters thick, were constructed in 1654-80. They incorporate parts of the earlier citadel, which helped to withstand the Polish siege in 1612. The first construction works were supervised by Jean de Gron, a French military engineer known in Russian sources as Anton Granovsky. After the monastic authorities denigrated his Western-style design as alien to Russian traditions, Granovsky was replaced by a team of native masters. The fortress was the largest erected in Muscovy after the Time of Troubles; its walls feature numerous towers, each built to a particular design. The most remarkable are the Chasuble, the Tent-like, the Vologda, and the Smithy towers.  After secularisation  After the Bolsheviks, the monastery was secularised and turned into a museum (1924), a wooden shrine from 1485 and several traditional timber structures were put on exhibit on the grounds. During Soviet restoration works, superb 16th-century frescoes were discovered in the gate church of St. Sergius (1560‚Äì94). On the other hand, the monastic library and some other treasures were transferred to Moscow and St Petersburg. These included the oldest extant copies of the 12th- century Daniel's Pilgrimage and the Zadonshchina. The larger part of the monastery is still administrated as the Kirillo-Belozersky Museum of History, Art, and Architecture. The monks were readmitted into the Ivanovsky priory in 1998. As of 2011, the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery was one of the four functioning monasteries in Vologda Oblast. The ensemble of the monastery has been designated as a cultural heritage monument of federal significance. As of January 2013, images from the monastery and grounds were available on Google Street View.  References   Further reading  * Brumfield, William C.

After starting with plays for theaters in New York City, he worked in Hollywood on writing for films.Obituary Variety, 17 August 1977, p. 63. He was the first president of the Writers Guild of America, West after the Screen Writers Guild divided into two regional organizations. Lawson was one of the Hollywood Ten, the first group of American film industry professionals to be blacklisted by Congress during the 1950s McCarthy era's investigation of communist influence in Hollywood. He and his colleagues refused to testify; he was convicted of contempt of Congress and served a year in prison. He moved to Mexico, where he wrote some books about theater. After returning to the US, he taught at some universities in California. He wrote the screenplay under a pseudonym for Cry, the Beloved Country (1951), an adaptation of Alan Paton's novel about South Africa that was critical of apartheid. Life and career =Early life and education= John Howard Lawson was born on September 25, 1894 in New York City to parents originally named Simeon Levy and Belle Hart, who were Jewish. Before their first child was born, his father changed the family name from Levy to Lawson, joking that this was so that his son could \\"obtain reservations at expensive resort hotels\\". When John was five, his mother died. She had named her three children after people she admired: John Howard Lawson was named after prison reformer John Howard, his sister Adelaide Jaffery Lawson was named after a friend of hers who was active in social causes, and Wendell Holmes Lawson was named after reforming American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. As a successful businessman, Simeon sent his children to private schools. At age seven, John attended Elizabeth and Alexis Ferms' \\"Children's Playhouse\\" school, an experimental school for children.Avrich, Paul. The Modern School Movement, Princeton University Press, 1980, 265. Later he and his siblings went to Halstead School in Yonkers, New York and then to Cutler School in New Rochelle, New York. In 1906, Simeon sent the three children on a tour of Europe, and seeing theatre was on the list of activities. John Howard took notes on the set designs, actors, and plays. In 1909, they were sent on a tour of the United States and Canada. After studying at Williams College (1910‚Äì1914) and graduating with a B.A., Lawson became a successful writer, gaining production of early plays such as Standards (1916) and Servant-Master- Lover (1916). While he was at Williams, his brother Wendell studied music and art in Germany. Lawson was attracted to works by Karl Kautsky because of his sense of alienation. He contributed to The Williams College Monthly. He also served as an editor of the senior-class book and a member of the varsity debating team. He was known to other students as a good-natured iconoclast and a frequent speaker at undergraduate meetings. After graduating, he worked as an editor at Reuters from 1914-1915. =Early career= Lawson wrote his first play, A Hindoo Love Drama, while at Williams. Mary Kirkpatrick, faculty leader of the Williams College Drama Club, was impressed by this effort and encouraged him. Lawson was inspired to write three plays in 1915-1916: Standards, The Spice of Life, and Servant-Master-Lover. Standards was bought by George M. Cohan and Sam Harris, and was given a tryout in Albany and Syracuse in 1915. It never made it to Broadway. Oliver Morosco produced Servant-Master-Lover in a run in Los Angeles, but received bad reviews. =World War I= When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Lawson was opposed to joining. His father helped him to get a position in the Norton- Harjes Volunteer Ambulance Corps. In June 1917, he left for Europe and aboard the ship met John Dos Passos, also a writer. In November, when Norton-Hayes was folded into the American Red Cross's Ambulance Service, Dos Passos and Lawson decided to become drivers; they went to Italy. At this time, Dos Passos was working on One Man's Initiation: 1917 and Lawson on Roger Bloomer. While serving, they were outfitted to Paris. Lawson attended performances of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise and Sergey Diaghilev's Ballet Russe. In January 1918, Dos Passos wrote a letter that was critical of the ambulance company. It somehow reached Red Cross officials, and they forced Dos Passos to resign. Lawson was under suspicion for his attitudes, as well, but he managed to stay in Italy and do public-relations work for the Red Cross. In the spring of 1919, Lawson returned to Paris from Italy. He married Katharine (Kate) Drain, who was a volunteer nurses' aide. She later worked as an actress. They had a child together but divorced by 1923. =Post War= After the war Lawson and Kate lived and worked in Rome, where he edited a newspaper. He lived in Paris in 1920-1921, where he completed Roger Bloomer. This was Lawson's first show to reach Broadway, where it opened on March 1, 1923. It was put on by the Equity Players and ran for fifty performances. His next show, Processional, opened on Broadway on January 12, 1925, produced by the Theatre Guild. It ran for 96 performances. The production, however, failed financially, and the Theatre Guild told Lawson that they would not stage any more expressionistic plays. It was later revived in 1937 for the Federal Theatre Project during the Great Depression, when it received critical and popular acclaim. Lawson was fascinated by the works he saw when in 1926 the New York International Theatrical Exposition showcased experimental European cubist, futurist, and constructivist plays. After seeing these, Lawson, Dos Passos, and Michael Gold (founder/editor of The New Masses magazine) formed the Workers Drama League to produce revolutionary plays. One production and a few weeks later, the three men disbanded. They joined Em Jo Basshe and Francis Edward Faragoh, and formed the New Playwrights Theatre. This lasted until 1929; they were supported largely by funding from millionaire businessman Otto Hermann Kahn. March 3, 1926 was the premiere of Lawson's Nirvana at the Greenwich Village Theatre, which ran for six performances. The play calls for a new religion to help people survive the swirling cyclone of jazz, new machinery, great buildings, science fiction, tabloids, and radio. Lawson's reputation after Processional and the notable set design by Mordecai Gorelik are considered to have helped it gain the six showings. In late 1926, Lawson, along with Dos Passos and Gold, who together were on the National Executive Committee attempting to found the Proletarian Artists and Writers League. A similar Soviet Union organization offered some financial backing to them. In August 1927, Dos Passos, Gold, and Lawson went to Boston to protest the Sacco and Vanzetti trial. In his diary afterword, Lawson would write that he could \\"neither ignore the flaws in American politics and economics nor bring himself to become more deeply involved in the struggle\\". The first play produced by the New Playwrights Theatre, Lawson's Loud Speaker, opened on March 7, 1927 at the 52nd Street Theatre and ran for forty-two performances. He had been intrigued by the ceremonial laying of the cornerstone at the new Theatre Guild playhouse in 1924, an event attended by both Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York and Otto Kahn. In his play, Lawson explored the concept of Kahn as governor rather than Smith. =Hollywood= While Lawson was working in Hollywood, New Playwrights Theatre decided to produce his play, The International, with set design by John Dos Passos. It opened on January 12, 1928 and ran for twenty- seven performances. In 1928, Lawson moved to Hollywood, where he wrote scripts for films such as The Ship for Shanghai, Bachelor Apartment, and Goodbye Love. In the winter of 1930-1931, during the Great Depression, Lawson wrote Success Story. The Theatre Guild rejected the script, but Harold Clurman, a reader for them, had recently formed the Group Theatre and needed new scripts. Clurman and Lawson reworked the play during the summer of 1932, and Success Story opened on September 26, 1932 for 121 performances. Lawson also adapted his play, Success at Any Price, for film, writing the screenplay for the 1934 work. In 1933, Lester Cole, Samuel Ornitz, and Lawson helped to organize and become first presidents of the Screen Writers Guild. After Lawson was fired from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, he moved to Washington, D.C. There he worked to have the group recognized by the National Labor Board for purposes of bargaining for screenwriters. While in D.C., Lawson's The Pure in Heart and Gentlewoman were being produced in New York. Lawson wrote The Pure in Heart while he was working on Success Story. The Theatre Guild agreed to produce the play, but closed it when the out-of-town tryout in Baltimore failed. After the Group Theatre also rejected the play, it was produced by Richard Aldrich and Alfred De Liagre. The Pure in Heart opened on March 20, 1933, and had a run of only seven performances. Gentlewoman, completed in association with D. A. Doran Jr, was produced by the Group Theatre and opened on March 22, 1934. It ran for twelve performances. During the 1930s, leftists accused Lawson of lacking ideological and political commitment. New Playwrights Theatre associate Mike Gold attacked him in The New Masses on April 10, 1934, describing him as \\"A Bourgeois Hamlet of Our Time\\", who wrote adolescent works that lacked moral fiber or clear ideas. Lawson responded a week later in The New Masses. In the article \\"'Inner Conflict' and Proletarian Art\\", he said his middle-class childhood prevented him from fully understanding the working people. He acknowledged that his prosperity and Hollywood connections were suspect in the fight for workers' rights. Due to the criticism, he officially joined the Communist Party in 1934 and began to educate himself about the proletarian cause. He soon traveled throughout the poverty-stricken South to study violent labor conflicts in Alabama and Georgia, where workers were trying to unionize. While in the South, Lawson submitted articles to the Daily Worker; he was arrested numerous times. These experiences inspired his next play, Marching Song. It was produced by the radical Theatre Union, opening in New York on February 17, 1937, and running for sixty-one performances. Lawson wrote the screenplay for several films during the 1930s that were political, including Blockade (1938), which starred Henry Fonda. This film on the Spanish Civil War earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Story. Lawson also wrote Counter-Attack (1945), a tribute to the Soviet-USA alliance during the late stages of the Second World War. He also wrote the critically acclaimed Algiers (1938), and the Humphrey Bogart vehicles Sahara and Action in the North Atlantic in 1943. In 1941, Lawson ordered Budd Schulberg to make changes to his novel What Makes Sammy Run? to better fit the Communist message; Schulberg refused and quit the American Communist Party in protest.Kenneth Lloyd Billingsly (1998). Hollywood Party: How Communism Seduced the American Film Industry in the 1930s and 1940s. Rocklin, CA: Prima/Forum Lawson organized and led a critical attack in 1946 on Albert Maltz after he published an article, \\"What Shall We Ask of Writers\\", in The New Masses, challenging the didacticism of the American Communist Party's censorship of writers. Surprised by the ferocity of attack from his fellow writers, including Lawson, Howard Fast, Alvah Bessie, Ring Lardner, Jr., Samuel Sillen, and others, Maltz publicly recanted. =House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)= After World War II, American fears of communist power increased after the Soviet Union established communist governments in eastern Europe. The House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) began an investigation into communist and socialist influence in the Hollywood motion picture industry. Lawson appeared before the HUAC on October 29, 1947. Like Alvah Bessie, Herbert Biberman, Albert Maltz, Adrian Scott, Dalton Trumbo, Lester Cole, Edward Dmytryk, Samuel Ornitz and Ring Lardner Jr, he refused to answer almost all questions and would not give names of other people he knew in communist circles. Known as the Hollywood Ten, they claimed that the First Amendment of the United States Constitution gave them the right to do this. The HUAC and U.S. appeals courts, however, disagreed and all ten men were found guilty of contempt of Congress. Lawson was sentenced to twelve months in Ashland Prison and fined $1,000. They were known as the Hollywood Ten and were blacklisted from writing for Hollywood. In 1951, Edward Dmytryk testified before HUAC that Lawson, among others, had pressured him to put communist propaganda in his films.‚ÄúThey Want to Muzzle Public Opinion‚Äù: John Howard Lawson‚Äôs Warning to the American Public, Testimony before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) October 27, 1947. In: History Matters, The American Social History Project, CUNY and George Mason University. =Post blacklist= Blacklisted by the Hollywood studios, Lawson moved to Mexico where he began writing Marxist interpretations of drama and film-making, such as The Hidden Heritage (1950), Film in the Battle of Ideas (1953), and Film: The Creative Process (1964). He also wrote one of the first anti-apartheid movies, Cry, the Beloved Country (1951), with a screenplay published under a pseudonym. Despite the blacklist, Lawson was hired to teach at several American universities including: Stanford University, Loyola Marymount University, and Los Angeles University of Judaism. In his book Film in the Battle of Ideas, Lawson wrote that \\"the rulers of the United States take the film very seriously as an instrument of propaganda\\" and said they believed that the influence of Hollywood movies was used to \\"poison the minds of U.S. working-class people\\". He believed that was inaccurate about U.S. working-class life. Lawson wrote that Hollywood \\"falsifies the life of American workers\\" and its \\"unwritten law decrees that only the middle and upper classes provide themes suitable for film presentation, and that workers appear on the screen only in subordinate or comic roles.\\" According to Lawson, \\"workers and their families see films which urge them to despise the values by which they live, and to emulate the corrupt values of their enemies\\" and \\"the consistent presentation on the nation's screens of the views that working-class life is to be despised and that workers who seek to protect their class interests are stupid, malicious, or even treasonable\\" is what Hollywood engages in. Lawson argued that Hollywood promoted degrading images of women in the first half of the 20th century. He said, \\"Hollywood treats 'glamour' and sex appeal as the sum-total of woman's personality\\" and \\"portraits of women in Hollywood films fall into three general categories: the woman as a criminal or the instigator of crime; the woman as man's enemy, fighting and losing - for she must always lose - in the battle of the sexes; the woman as a \`primitive' child, fulfilling the male dream of a totally submissive vehicle of physical pleasure.\\" Lawson also argued that in most U.S. movies, \\"when a woman succeeds in the world of competition, Hollywood holds that her success is achieved by trickery, deceit, and the amoral use of sexual appeal.\\" The manuscript of his unpublished autobiography is held at Southern Illinois University Carbondale in Carbondale, Illinois. Religion Lawson was born into a wealthy Jewish family, and had to deal with social discrimination. His father had changed their surname to one of English style. As a boy, Lawson went to the house of a Christian schoolmate, where he mentioned his father's real name was Levy. He was not invited to the house again. His father insisted that the family join a Christian church. They joined the First Church at 96th Street and Central Park West. John Howard continued to observe Jewish dietary laws. While at Williams College, during his sophomore year Lawson was denied election to the editorial board of The Williams College Monthly because some students raised questions about his Jewish background. He would later say that it was a good experience because it forced him \\"to begin his struggle to come to terms with his Jewish identity\\".

He is seen as a father of modern meteorology. Biography He was educated at the gymnasium of Kremsm√ºnster and then studied mathematics, chemistry and physics at the University of Vienna, then geology and paleontology under Eduard Suess and physical geography under Friedrich Simony. From 1865 to 1868, he was master at the Oberrealschule at Linz, and in 1865 was invited by Karl Jelinek to become the first editor of the Zeitschrift f√ºr Meteorologie. In 1877, he succeeded Jelinek as the director of the Meteorologische Zentralanstalt (Central Institute for Meteorology and Earth Magnetism) and was appointed professor of meteorology at the University of Vienna. In 1897, he retired as director and became professor of meteorology at the University of Graz, but returned to Vienna to fill the chair of professor of cosmic physics in 1900, where he remained until 1910. In 1912, he was made a foreign knight of the Prussian Ordre Pour le M√©rite. Hann window Hann invented a weighted moving average technique for combining meteorological data from neighboring regions, using the weights [1/4, 1/2, 1/4], known as Hann smoothing. In signal processing, the Hann window is a window function, called the Hann function, derived from this technique by R. B. Blackman and John Tukey in 1959. Here, the use of the Hann window is called \\"hanning\\", e.g., \\"hanning\\" a signal is to apply the Hann window to it.

It is related to chloroquine and mefloquine. Although formerly available from compounding pharmacies, as of August 2020 it is unavailable in the United States. Medical uses anti-malaria drug); this sign was posted at the 363rd Station Hospital on Papua, New Guinea during World War II The main uses of mepacrine are as an antiprotozoal, antirheumatic and an intrapleural sclerosing agent.Drugs.com: Quinacrine. Retrieved on August 24, 2009. Antiprotozoal use include targeting giardiasis, where mepacrine is indicated as a primary agent for patients with metronidazole-resistant giardiasis and patients who should not receive or can not tolerate metronidazole. Giardiasis that is very resistant may even require a combination of mepacrine and metronidazole. Mepacrine is also used off-label for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, indicated in the treatment of discoid and subcutaneous lupus erythematosus, particularly in patients unable to take chloroquine derivatives. As an intrapleural sclerosing agent, it is used as pneumothorax prophylaxis in patients at high risk of recurrence, e.g., cystic fibrosis patients. Mepacrine is not the drug of choice because side effects are common, including toxic psychosis, and may cause permanent damage. See mefloquine for more information. In addition to medical applications, mepacrine is an effective in vitro research tool for the epifluorescent visualization of cells, especially platelets. Mepacrine is a green fluorescent dye taken up by most cells. Platelets store mepacrine in dense granules. Mechanism Its mechanism of action against protozoa is uncertain, but it is thought to act against the protozoan's cell membrane. It is known to act as a histamine N-methyltransferase inhibitor. It also inhibits NF-Œ∫B and activates p53. History =Antiprotozoal= Mepacrine was initially approved in the 1930s as an antimalarial drug. It was used extensively during the second World War by Allied forces fighting in North Africa and the Far East to prevent malaria. This antiprotozoal is also approved for the treatment of giardiasis (an intestinal parasite), and has been researched as an inhibitor of phospholipase A2. Scientists at Bayer in Germany first synthesised mepacrine in 1931. The product was one of the first synthetic substitutes for quinine although later superseded by chloroquine. =Anthelmintics= In addition it has been used for treating tapeworm infections. =Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease= Mepacrine has been shown to bind to the prion protein and prevent the formation of prion aggregates in vitro, and full clinical trials of its use as a treatment for Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease are under way in the United Kingdom and the United States. Small trials in Japan have reported improvement in the condition of patients with the disease, although other reports have shown no significant effect, and treatment of scrapie in mice and sheep has also shown no effect.  Abstract Possible reasons for the lack of an in vivo effect include inefficient penetration of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, as well as the existence of drug- resistant prion proteins that increase in number when selected for by treatment with mepacrine. =Non-surgical sterilization for women = The use of mepacrine for non-surgical sterilization for women has also been studied. The first report of this method claimed a first year failure rate of 3.1%. However, despite a multitude of clinical studies on the use of mepacrine and female sterilization, no randomized, controlled trials have been reported to date and there is some controversy over its use. Pellets of mepacrine are inserted through the cervix into a woman's uterine cavity using a preloaded inserter device, similar in manner to IUCD insertion. The procedure is undertaken twice, first in the proliferative phase, 6 to 12 days following the first day of the menstrual cycle and again one month later. The sclerosing effects of the drugs at the utero-tubal junctions (where the Fallopian tubes enter the uterus) results in scar tissue forming over a six-week interval to close off the tubes permanently. In the United States, this method has undergone Phase I clinical testing. The FDA has waived the necessity for Phase II clinical trials because of the extensive data pertaining to other uses of mepacrine. The next step in the FDA approval process in the United States is a Phase III large multi-center clinical trial. The method is currently used off- label. Many peer reviewed studies suggest that mepacrine sterilization (QS) is potentially safer than surgical sterilization. Nevertheless, in 1998 the Supreme Court of India banned the import or use of the drug, allegedly based on reports that it could cause cancer or ectopic pregnancies.. =Skin dye= During the Second Sino-Japanese War, American Sino-American Cooperative Organization operatives yellowed their skin using mepacrine tablets in order to more closely match the skin color of their Chinese peers.

The game is named after the popular English footballer Emlyn Hughes. It initially appeared on the Commodore 64, with other versions produced for the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Atari ST and Amiga. The game was programmed by Graham Blighe with additional coding by Michael McLean. Gameplay included arcade-style action and the management aspect of the sport. Critical response to the game was generally positive with accolades and high ratings from the industry magazines.  History  It debuted on Commodore 64, but versions were also developed for Amstrad, ZX Spectrum, Atari ST and Amiga as part of Audiogenic's general cross-platform strategy. Upon its release it was hailed by some as the most realistic football simulation ever made, and gathered enthusiastic reviews, in particular from ZZAP!64. The program was in the UK computer games charts for over three years following its release, and was still enjoying a small but enthusiastic cult following almost 20 years after its release.EHIS Community site comment Every version of the game was programmed by Graham Blighe and produced by Peter Calver, with graphics created by Andrew Calver, and playtesting by Jeremy Wellard (who later founded HB Studios); the strategy section was coded by Michael McLean (in later versions Terry Wiley). The music for the Commodore 64 version was written by Barry Leitch. The inspiration for the game came from International Soccer, a highly successful cartridge game for the Commodore 64 that had been released by Commodore themselves in the early 1980s. Indeed, EHIS offered an optional mode in which the controls were deliberately limited, to simulate the restricted options available in the earlier game. This both provided an easy introduction and helped to emphasise the extent to which the controls had been enhanced. At the time of its release EHIS faced heavy competition from titles such as Match Day II (1987), Kick Off (1989) and Microprose Soccer. However, what made EHIS different from the other games of its time was the fine balance between playability and simulation - it was not as slow as Match Day II, nor as reflex-driven as Kick Off and Sensible Soccer. As a result, the appeal of EHIS was strongest among those who preferred skillful, tactical football to frantic arcade action. Despite limited graphics, and a side view of the action (whereas Kick Off had recently introduced the bird's-eye perspective), EHIS held its own because of a powerful control system that gave the players unprecedented control over the game.  Gameplay  EHIS gameplay included the basic running, kicking, shooting style but also had advanced technique gameplay which added depth and realism to the game. For example; turning naturally involved changing direction of the joystick, but instead of coming to a halt straight away, the player would slow down, stop and start to run in the direction of the joystick. EHIS advanced techniques included The '5-direction' option. This meant that you could pass and shoot up to 5 different directions from where your player is facing. This was achieved by holding the fire button and pushing the joystick at an angle from where your player is running and releasing the button. Other techniques include sidestepping, barging, heading, back heels, lobs, diving headers, sliding tackles and many other miscellaneous features. This was the first time that management features had been included in an arcade-style soccer game, and the identities of the players were reinforced with a rudimentary on-screen commentary, another ground-breaking feature. The game was also highly configurable with everything from the players' stats and names to the pitch and shirt colours. The management aspect included picking your squad (based on player skills and fitness levels). Amongst the many options you can compete in competitions including cup, championship and leagues. EHIS was one of the first football games to include a full season of gameplay. You would compete in a league competition (home and away) and take part in a knock-out style cup competition. Throughout the season your player's fitness and morale would fluctuate and they could even get injured.  Reception  Zzap!64 awarded the game with a 90% rating, gaining a Zzap! 'Sizzler' accolade. \\"Quite simply the best football game on the 64!\\"Zzap!64, issue 43, November 1988, p 28 Commodore User gave an 84% rating explaining that \\"this isn't quite Microprose Soccer but it's still a vast improvement on many of the football games available.\\"\\"Patterson, Mark.

Life He was born at Mansfield, Nottinghamshire and was the son of a bookseller. He entered the Royal Academy Schools, and was also a fellow-student with Holman Hunt, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Collinson was a devout Christian who was attracted to the devotional and high church aspects of Pre-Raphaelitism. A convert to Catholicism, Collinson reverted to high Anglicanism in order to marry Christina Rossetti, but his conscience forced his return to Catholicism and the break-up of the engagement. When Millais' painting Christ in the House of his Parents was accused of blasphemy, Collinson resigned from the Brotherhood in the belief that it was bringing the Christian religion into disrepute. During his period as a Pre-Raphaelite, Collinson contributed a long devotional poem to The Germ and produced a number of religious works, most importantly The Renunciation of St. Elizabeth of Hungary (1850). After his resignation Collinson trained for the priesthood at a Jesuit college, but did not complete his studies. In 1858, he married Eliza Wheeler, one of the sisters-in-law of the painter John Rogers Herbert, an early influence on the Pre-Raphaelites. Returning to his artistic career he painted a number of secular genre paintings, the best-known of which are To Let and For Sale, both of which lightheartedly depict pretty women in situations that suggest moral temptation. He was secretary of the Society of British Artists from 1861 to 1870. In the latter part of his life he lived in Brittany, where he painted The Holy Family (1878). He died in April 1881.

Plot Anatole the mouse lives in a mouse village outside the city of Paris. One day, while commuting by bicycle to forage for food, he overhears some humans complaining about mice as villains. Deeply aggrieved at the insult to his honor, Anatole resolves to do better. He goes to work in a French cheese factory as a taster and evaluator of the cheese. Working alone and anonymously late at night, he leaves notes to guide the cheesemakers in their work. His taste for good cheese leads to the factory's commercial success and to his murine fame to such an extent that Anatole is regularly hailed as a \\"mouse magnifique\\" by rodent contemporaries. The factory's human owners and workers also hold his work in high esteem, although they have no idea that the mysterious Anatole is a mouse, believing him simply an eccentric cheese connoisseur who prefers to work alone. In these works the author, through the character of Anatole, consistently places emphasis on the dignity of work. Anatole lives in a conventional nuclear family, married to the beautiful and supportive Doucette and with six lovely children.

Lane was described as \\"the television writer who dared to make women funny\\"; much of her work focused on strong women characters, including \\"frustrated housewives and working class matriarchs\\". In later years she became well known as an animal welfare advocate. Early life and education Lane was born in West Derby, Liverpool. Her father, Cardiff-born Gordon De Vince Barrack, served in the Merchant Navy. She attended a convent school and, aged seven, won a school poetry prize. Lane grew up in West Derby and Heswall. She left school aged 14, and worked in nursing. According to her autobiography, she married at 17 and had two sons by the age of 19, though official records indicate that she was 19 when she married. Writing career In the 1960s, Lane wrote short stories and radio scripts. Her first successes came in collaboration with Myra Taylor, whom she had met at a writers' workshop in Liverpool. Lane and Taylor would often meet at the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool City Centre to write. She said that she used a pseudonym, \\"Carla Lane\\", because of her modesty about revealing that she was a writer. With Taylor, she submitted some comedy sketch scripts to the BBC, where they were seen by the head of comedy Michael Mills. He encouraged them to write a half-hour script, which was broadcast as a pilot episode of The Liver Birds in April 1969. A short first series followed, to little acclaim, but Mills then declined to produce a second series, changing his mind when Lane and Taylor wrote a series of new scripts. The series became one of the most popular of the time, characterised by Lane's \\"ability to conjure laughs out of pathos and life's little tragedies\\", and, from 1973, Lane took sole responsibility for writing the scripts. Her successful screenwriting career continued through the 1970s and 1980s, in particular with the TV series Butterflies and Bread. In Butterflies, described as \\"undoubtedly ... her finest work\\", she addressed the lead character's desires for freedom from her \\"decent but dull\\" husband. Wendy Craig, who starred in Butterflies, said of Lane: \\"Her greatest gift was that she understood women and wrote the truth about them ... She spoke about what others didn't. In the case of [Craig's lead character], it was all about what was going on inside her ‚Äì and many other women at the time.\\" In Bread, which ran for seven series, \\"she became the first woman to mine television comedy from sexual and personal relationships through a gal√®re of expertly-etched contemporary characters, developed against a backdrop of social issues such as divorce, adultery and.. alcoholism.\\" In the late 1980s, Bread had the third-highest viewing figures on British television, beaten only by EastEnders and Neighbours. However, Bread was criticised by some in Liverpool for portraying a stereotypical view of people in the city, Bronwyn Jones, \\"Carla Lane's sitcom Bread and its legacy in Liverpool\\", BBC News, 3 June 2016. Retrieved 3 June 2016 an opinion that Lane rejected. Animal welfare St. Tudwal's Island East (foreground), known for its wildlife and purchased by Lane Lane had been a vegetarian dedicated to the care and welfare of animals since 1965, She established the \\"Animal Line\\" trust in 1990 with her friends Rita Tushingham and Linda McCartney. In 1991, she bought Saint Tudwal's Island East off the coast of Wales, to protect its wildlife. In 1993, Lane converted the grounds of her mansion, Broadhurst Manor in Horsted Keynes, Sussex, into a 25-acre animal sanctuary. She operated the sanctuary for 15 years before having to close operations due to financial constraints. In 2002, Lane returned her OBE to then prime minister Tony Blair in protest against animal cruelty. In 2013, an animal sanctuary named after her was opened in Melling, Merseyside. Later life and death Lane published her autobiography, Someday I'll Find Me: Carla Lane's Autobiography, in 2006. She returned to Liverpool in 2009.

The DM&E; began operations on September 5, 1986, over trackage spun off from the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company in South Dakota and Minnesota. Many of the negotiations were handled by the office of Senator Larry Pressler and his legal counsel Kevin V. Schieffer. After DME's successful first decade, Schieffer succeeded J. C. McIntyre as president of the railroad on November 7, 1996. The DM&E; purchased the assets of I&M; Rail Link railroad in 2002, renaming it Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad. DM&E; combined its management and dispatching duties with those of ICE under the holding company Cedar American Rail Holdings. The combined system directly connects Chicago through Iowa to Kansas City, Minneapolis-St. Paul and continues as far west as Rapid City, South Dakota. Smaller branches extend into portions of Wisconsin, Wyoming and Nebraska. In September 2007 it was announced that Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) would acquire the DM&E; upon approval by the Surface Transportation Board of the US Department of Transportation.

Due to pressure from customers and Senator Larry Pressler from South Dakota, a deal was reached and announced on April 24, 1986, to purchase divisions of the C&NW; from Winona, Minnesota, to Rapid City, South Dakota, creating the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad. This deal also included buildings, rolling stock and locomotives, mostly rebuilt EMD SD9s, from the CNW. DM&E; began operations on this track on September 5, 1986.

The railroad filed an application for the expansion to the Surface Transportation Board (STB) on February 20, 1998. Burlington Northern Railroad built into this area in 1979, and the Chicago and North Western Railway (CNW) also sought to access the PRB coalfields, a project accomplished by CNW's successor Union Pacific Railroad. DM&E; would become the third railroad to tap into the coal deposits in the region. DM&E;'s expansion would require the construction of 281 miles (452 km) of new track, upgrading 598 miles (962 km) of existing track (including all of the railroad's mainline track in Minnesota), new mainline connections at Owatonna and Mankato, Minnesota, and three new rail yards. The plan would be the largest new railroad construction in the United States since the completion of Milwaukee Road's Pacific extension to Seattle, Washington, in 1909. = Initial approval = The STB approved the application on December 10 of that year pending completion of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which was released by the STB on September 27, 2000. An analysis of the plan by Minnesota's Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad Working Group in 2001 showed support among customers and freight shippers, but DM&E;'s expansion plan led to complaints among residents in communities along the railroad's right-of-way. While some communities welcomed the railroad's expansion plan as an opportunity for increased business within their own cities, other residents and businesses felt that roads in the area were not built with enough overpasses and underpasses to deal with the traffic flow problems that the longer and more frequent unit trains would produce at grade crossings. The objectors cited concerns of the general public in safely and quickly traversing their communities as well as the ability of emergency vehicles to cross the tracks to reach emergency scenes or hospitals.

This decision restores the legal process by which the railroad can effectively force landowners along the proposed new route to sell their land to the railroad.Kafka, Joe; Associated Press (April 15, 2004), Ruling moves railroad's plans forward (PDF), Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, p. 3B. Retrieved August 4, 2009. = Funding = With the final EIS in place and approval from the STB, DM&E; had the authority to undertake the expansion as proposed, but needed financing. On February 26, 2007, the FRA rejected a proposed $2.3 billion loan to DM&E.; In announcing the decision, Administrator Joseph H. Boardman noted that the project proposal met many federal requirements for the loan but cited concerns that the railroad might not be able to handle cost overruns during construction or to repay such a hefty amount after construction is completed.  2002‚Äì2007: consolidation with IC&E;  DM&E; and IC&E; combined route map as of 2002. DM&E; hauled nearly 60,000 carloads of freight in fiscal year 2002, serving approximately 130 customers along the railroad's mainline. Of these shipments, 53% were grains or grain products, 24% were bentonite and kaolin clay, 7% were cement, and 5% were wood and lumber products; the remaining 11% were split among all other types of freight. On February 21, 2002, DM&E; announced that it would purchase the railroad assets of I&M; Rail Link (IMRL) from its then-owner the Washington Corporation. DM&E; renamed the IMRL property to Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad (IC&E;) and began operating under that name on July 30, 2002. A purchase price was not stated in the original announcement, but an article in the May 2002 Trains Magazine reported that several industry sources believed the total to be around $150 million.Glischinski, Steve (May 2002), DM&E; becomes \\"a significant national player\\", Trains Magazine, p. 14. DM&E; and IC&E; combined management under the holding company Cedar American Rail Holdings. Locomotives of both railroads were given a unified paint scheme and interchanges were streamlined between the two railroads. The administration of both railroads is handled by Cedar, further streamlining processes between the two railroads. The combined DM&E;/IC&E; system makes up the largest Class II railroad (by route-miles) in the United States; it is also the eighth largest system of all American railroads and the only system with direct rail connections with all Class I railroads in North America. In its first twenty years of operations, the railroad's revenues had increased more than tenfold, from $22 million in 1987 to $258 million in 2006, with $290 million projected in 2007 and $340 million for 2008. Its operating ratio (the ratio of operating expenses to revenues) declined to 70.2% in 2006 and was projected to improve further to 67.6% in 2007. Its traffic was a mix of agricultural, coal, and industrial products, and ethanol shipments were projected to exceed one billion gallons in 2008.  Acquisition by Canadian Pacific Railway  On September 4, 2007, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) announced it was acquiring the DM&E; from its owners, London-based Electra Private Equity, for US$1.48 billion, and future payments of over $1.0 billion contingent on commencement of construction on the Powder River extension and specified volumes of coal shipments from the Powder River basin. The transaction will include the ICE and other affiliated companies. The merger is an \\"end-to-end\\" consolidation; the lines presently interchange at three points, including the Winona, Minnesota, connection between the DM&E;'s main line across southern Minnesota and CP's Chicago main. Kevin Schieffer, president of the DM&E;, has called CP the DM&E;'s \\"natural partner\\" and the transaction a \\"natural fit\\". The acquisition will give CP access to shipments of agricultural products and ethanol in addition to coal from the Wyoming coal fields. CP has stated its intention to use this purchase to gain access to the Powder River and ship coal to midwestern and eastern utilities. The transaction is subject to approval of the Surface Transportation Board, which is expected to take a year. Securities analysts have stated that competing railroads for Powder River coal, the Union Pacific and BNSF, could challenge the acquisition and delay STB approval, but are unlikely to prevent it. At least until approval is received, the DM&E; will continue to operate as a separate entity. On October 4, 2007, CP announced that it has completed the financial transactions to acquire the DM&E; and subsidiaries. Control of DM&E; has been placed into a voting trust with Richard Hamlin appointed as trustee; the trust will remain in effect until the STB issues its decision on the acquisition. CP plans to integrate DM&E;'s operations once it receives STB approval. CP expected STB approval of the purchase in October 2008. The STB announced its approval of the purchase plan on September 30, 2008, with no conditions other than those that CP had already agreed to in the original plan; the effective date of the purchase was October 30, 2008. CP assumed control of DM&E; and IC&E; on October 30, 2008. CP plans to invest $300 million in capital improvements to the former DM&E; lines by 2011.  Recent developments  On December 3, 2012, CP announced it was indefinitely placing on hold plans for building new trackage into the Powder River Basin. The next day the railroad announced its intention to sell the entire ex-DM&E; west of Tracy, Minnesota, roughly of track. On January 2, 2014, CP announced that all track west of Tracy, Minnesota, was to be sold to Rapid City, Pierre and Eastern Railroad, a subsidiary of Genesee & Wyoming, a short line operator. The sale was completed on May 30, 2014, for $210 million. Most of the Rapid City, Pierre and Eastern's employees came over from the DM&E.;  Subdivisions  DM&E; operated over twelve subdivisions. The divisions were located in Minnesota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Nebraska. * Waseca Subdivision ‚Äî Winona to Waseca, Minnesota * Hartland Subdivision ‚Äî Waseca, Minnesota to Mason City, Iowa * Tracy Subdivision ‚Äî Waseca to Tracy, Minnesota * Huron Subdivision ‚Äî Tracy, Minnesota to Huron, South Dakota * Yale Spur Subdivision ‚Äî Huron to Watertown, South Dakota * Redfield Subdivision ‚Äî Aberdeen to Wolsey, South Dakota * Mansfield Subdivision ‚Äî Redfield to Mansfield, South Dakota * Pierre Subdivision ‚Äî Huron to Pierre, South Dakota * Onida Subdivision ‚Äî Blunt to Onida, South Dakota * PRC Subdivision ‚Äî Pierre to Rapid City, South Dakota * Crawford Subdivision ‚Äî Chadron to Crawford, Nebraska A lashup of HLCX, DME and ICE locomotives at Dubuque, Iowa  Rolling stock  DME 4006, City of Balaton, an EMD GP40. DM&E; originally purchased used first-generation locomotives from a variety of railroads; in the early years it was more common to see a locomotive with a Milwaukee Road or Chicago and North Western Railway paint scheme than a DM&E; paint scheme. Over the years, the locomotives were repainted, and many of them are now in DM&E;'s paint scheme (which is closely mirrored by that of sister Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad) of blue with a yellow stripe along its length. DM&E; eventually assigns names to all of its locomotives when they are repainted, usually after locations along its right- of-way, but a few exceptions have been named for people (like road number 550, named after Senator Larry Pressler). All of the first-generation diesel locomotives purchased from Chicago and North Western and Milwaukee Road have since been replaced with more recent locomotives, although the newer locomotives were also bought used.

By the railroad's tenth anniversary in 1996, DM&E; owned 69 locomotives and owned or leased over 1,500 cars including over 600 covered hoppers for grain and cement shipments. In 2001, the number of locomotives owned stayed about the same, while the number of cars increased to about 5,000 with 52% of them in dedicated grain service.

When DM&E; was formed in 1986, McIntyre became the new railroad's first president. * Kevin V. Schieffer (1996‚Äì2008) served as counsel for Senator Larry Pressler starting in 1982. Schieffer began working with DM&E; business in 1983 when he worked to prevent the abandonment of C&NW; branch lines that would eventually form the beginnings of DM&E.; He initiated the negotiations in 1985 that led to DM&E;'s creation. He was promoted to Chief of Staff for Senator Pressler in 1987, a position he held until 1991 when United States President George H. W. Bush appointed Schieffer to be US Attorney for South Dakota. In 1993, Schieffer left his US Attorney post and became the legal counsel for DM&E; as legal counsel for the railroad, he oversaw the railroad's recapitalization in 1994 and the acquisition of C&NW;'s Colony line. He held this position until he was unanimously elected president of the railroad on November 7, 1996. Schieffer left the DM&E; on October 7, 2008, shortly after the Surface Transportation Board approved the proposed purchase of the railroad by Canadian Pacific; DM&E;'s COO Ed Terbell and CFO Kurt Feaster were named to manage the railroad until CP completed the acquisition October 30, 2008. * Vern Graham (2008‚Äì2010) was appointed president November 5, 2008.

Large print edition. . p. 33 and active in the development of Transcendentalism. He was one of the foremost scholars of German literature in the United States. Biography Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Hedge was the son of Harvard University professor of logic and metaphysics Levi Hedge. At the age of 12, he traveled to Germany and studied music for five years under the care of George Bancroft. He then entered Harvard as a junior and graduated in 1825. His knowledge of German was to serve him well both in hymnody ‚Äî he translated Luther's \\"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\\" (\\"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God\\") into the most popular English version ‚Äî and in philosophy, where it allowed him a greater familiarity with Kant than most of the Americans of his day. After graduating as valedictorian, he enrolled in Harvard Divinity School, where he met his intimate friend Ralph Waldo Emerson. After graduating from the Divinity School in 1828, Hedge was ordained as a Unitarian minister in 1829, and became minister at a Unitarian church in West Cambridge. In 1835 he took charge of a church in Bangor, Maine; in 1850, after spending a year in Europe, he became pastor of the Westminster Church in Providence, Rhode Island, and in 1856 of the church in Brookline, Massachusetts. He was central to the development of Transcendentalism in the 1830s. On September 8, 1836, Hedge met with Ralph Waldo Emerson, George Putnam (1807-1878), and George Ripley in Cambridge to discuss the formation of a new club.Packer, Barbara L. The Transcendentalists. Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 2007: 47. Eleven days later, Ripley hosted their first official meeting at his house on September 18, 1836; the group would eventually be known as the Transcendental Club. Its first official meeting was attended by Amos Bronson Alcott, Orestes Brownson, James Freeman Clarke, and Convers Francis as well as Hedge, Emerson, and Ripley.Hankins, Barry. The Second Great Awakening and the Transcendentalists. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2004: 23. Future members would include Henry David Thoreau, William Henry Channing, Christopher Pearse Cranch, Sylvester Judd, and Jones Very.Gura, Philip F. American Transcendentalism: A History. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 7‚Äì8. The group planned its meetings for times when Hedge was visiting from Bangor, Maine, leading to the early nickname \\"Hedge's Club\\". Hedge wrote: \\"There was no club in the strict sense... only occasional meetings of like-minded men and women\\", earning the nickname \\"the brotherhood of the 'Like-Minded'\\".Gura, Philip F. American Transcendentalism: A History. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 5. He became alienated from the group's more extreme positions in the 1840s and did not publish in the Transcendental journal The Dial, despite his friendship with its editor Margaret Fuller, saying he did not want to be associated with the movement in print.Packer, Barbara L. The Transcendentalists. Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 2007: 115. He was noted as a public lecturer as well as a pulpit orator. In 1853-1854, he lectured on medieval history before the Lowell Institute. In 1858, Hedge returned to Harvard Divinity School as a professor of ecclesiastical history; that year, he also became editor of the Christian Examiner, a role he held for three years.Packer, Barbara L. The Transcendentalists. Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 2007: 168. The next year, Hedge began a four-year term as president of the American Unitarian Association. In 1872, he resigned his pastorship in Brookline to become professor of German literature at Harvard. He retained this position until 1881. Deeply read in philosophy, ecclesiastical history, and German literature, he ranked as perhaps the foremost German literary scholar in the United States. Works Besides essays on the different schools of philosophy, notably magazine articles on St. Augustine, Leibniz, Schopenhauer, and Coleridge, and other contributions to periodicals in prose and poetry, he published: * The Prose Writers of Germany, extracts and biographical sketches (Philadelphia, 1848) * A Christian Liturgy for the Use of the Church (Boston, 1856) * Reason in Religion (Boston, 1865) * The Primeval World of Hebrew Tradition (1870) * Hours with German Classics (1886) * Metrical Translations and Poems (with Annis Lee Wister; Boston, 1888) * Martin Luther and Other Essays (1888) He also wrote hymns for the Unitarian church, and assisted in the compilation of a hymn-book (1853), and published numerous translations from the German poets, including Martin Luther's (\\"A Mighty Fortress is Our God\\"). Legacy His chief significance to American thought was his introduction of German scholarship and literature.

(formerly Regent Communications until 2010) is an American radio network and media company based in Purchase, New York. The company started in radio and expanded into digital media toward the end of the 2000s, starting with the acquisition of the MOG Music Network. As of 2019, Townsquare was the third-largest AM‚ÄìFM operator in the country, owning over 321 radio stations in 67 markets. History =As Regent Communications= Regent Communications logo before rebranding Townsquare Media was established as Regent Communications by Terry Jacobs in 1994. Jacobs was formerly the CEO of Jacor Communications, a radio broadcasting company which he created in 1979. Bill Stakelin later shared chief status in the company with Jacobs, and the two established JS Communications, later selling Regent to Jacor in 1997. Stakelin and Jacobs resurrected the Regent name to replace JS, with approval by Jacor. Jacobs left the company in 2005. On October 27, 2008, Regent Broadcasting joined Radiolicious and began streaming on the iPhone and iPod Touch. Regent is the first major radio group to contract for all of its streaming stations to be available through the Radiolicious application. =As Townsquare Media= Regent filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 1, 2010, with $211.3 million in debt, $166.5 million in assets, and a pre- arranged plan for exiting bankruptcy, with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The filing plan made Oaktree Capital Management the majority owner of Regent after the bankruptcy and gave the old shareholders 12.8 cents per share. After the privatization, the company was renamed Townsquare Media. Gap Broadcasting Group, another radio group owned by Oaktree, was merged into Townsquare, giving it ownership of 171 radio stations in 36 markets. In December 2010, the company began to expand its digital media operations, overhauling its stations' websites and launching a new country music news website known as Taste of Country. Townsquare acquired a number of stations from Double O Radio in August 2011. On April 30, 2012, Townsquare Media announced a deal to acquire 55 stations in 11 markets from Cumulus Media, in exchange for Townsquare's stations in the markets of Bloomington and Peoria, IL and $126 million. On August 24, 2012, Townsquare reached a deal to acquire the MOG Music Network, an advertising network for music blogs. The network was part of MOG, a streaming music service that had previously reached a deal to be acquired by Beats Electronics. On October 1, 2012, Townsquare Media created Townsquare Interactive. Townsquare Interactive is the digital marketing division of Townsquare Media and focuses on creating comprehensive web presences for small businesses across the United States. In June 2013, Townsquare announced it would acquire a number of music-related blogs from AOL, including The Boombox, The Boot, and Noisecreep, along with ComicsAlliance. The deal came following the abrupt shutdown of AOL's Music division in April 2013. On August 29, 2013, it was announced that Cumulus would purchase Dial Global, after the programming syndication service was showing signs of financial distress in late 2012. Cumulus paid $260 million for this service, a portion of which was used to pay off Dial's debt before it was folded into Cumulus. To make the sale work, Cumulus once again made a pair of station deals with Townsquare Media; the first deal sent 53 stations in Danbury, CT, Rockford, IL, Cedar Rapids, IA, Quad Cities, IA‚ÄìIL, Waterloo, IA, Portland, ME, Battle Creek, MI, Kalamazoo, MI, Lansing, MI, Faribault, MN, Rochester, MN, and Portsmouth, NH, to Townsquare for $238 million. The second sent 15 more stations in Dubuque, IA and Poughkeepsie, NY, in exchange for Peak Broadcasting's Fresno cluster. Peak, which like Dial Global and Townsquare has a large investment held by Oaktree, also had its Boise cluster folded into Townsquare. Due to market overlaps, three of Townsquare's newly acquired stations were placed in a divestiture trust. The acquisition of the Cumulus stations closed on November 14, 2013.

Born, raised and educated in Toronto, Ontario, Mustard began his career as a research fellow at the University of Toronto where he studied the effects of blood lipids, their relation to heart disease and how Aspirin could mitigate those effects. He published the first clinical trial showing that aspirin could prevent heart attacks and strokes. In 1966, he was one of the founding faculty members at McMaster University's newly established medical school. He was the Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences and the medical school at McMaster University from 1972‚Äì1982. In 1982, he helped found the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and served as its founding president, serving until 1996. He wrote several papers and studies on early childhood development, including a report used by the Ontario Government that helped create a province-wide full- day kindergarten program. He won many awards including being made a companion of the Order of Canada ‚Äì the order's highest level ‚Äì and was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. He died November 16, 2011. Education Born on October 16, 1927 in Toronto, Ontario, he attended Whitney Public School and the University of Toronto Schools graduating in 1946. While an undergraduate at University of Toronto, he was a Member of Alpha Delta Phi. He received an MD from the University of Toronto in 1953. He interned at the Toronto General Hospital and spent two years of postgraduate study at the Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, where he earned his Ph.D. Upon returning to Canada, he was a senior intern at Sunnybrook Hospital and then a senior research associate with the Department of Veterans Affairs and a fellow in the Department of Medicine, University of Toronto.Packham, p. 170 In 1958, Mustard received a Medal of the Royal College of Physicians of Canada for an essay entitled, \\"A Study of the Relationship Between Lipids, Blood Coagulation and Atherosclerosis.\\"Packham, p. 161 His work demonstrated the link between acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) as a preventative for heart attacks and stroke. From 1960 to 1961, he was a research associate with the National Heart Foundation of Canada, and from 1962 to 1963 a research associate with the Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, and a senior research associate with the Canadian Heart Foundation. He became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada in 1965.Packham, p. 159 Leadership =Co-founding McMaster Medical School= In 1966, he was publicly criticizing the Canadian government's medical research funding practices, by stating that on average, 200 of the 900 medical doctors graduating from Canadian universities each year, were heading to the United States due to the lack of research funding in their home country. At the time, he said that medical schools would need to graduate 1500 doctors a year just to keep the standard of healthcare and research at its present level. He backed up his words by becoming a founding member of the McMaster University Faculty of Medicine in Hamilton, Ontario, and the first chairman of the Department of Pathology. In 1972, he became Dean and Vice-President of the Faculty of Health Sciences at McMaster University Medical School until 1982. =Establishing CIFAR= In 1982, he took on the task of creating and establishing The Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR), and became its founding president. The institute, in a period of ten-years, built a network across Canada that linked researchers in the economics, education, social health and high-tech fields like robotics. He was awarded the Royal Bank outstanding service to Canada award in 1993 for his work in setting up and stewarding CIFAR. He continued on as President of CIFAR until 1996. From 1996 to the autumn of 2011, he was the head of The Founders' Network, an international collection of people interested in promoting CIFAR, science and technology, early childhood, economic issues, determinants of health and human development. Early childhood learning reports =The Early Years Study= He was a leader in Canada on questions about the socioeconomic determinants of human development and health. A particular emphasis was on early childhood and the role of communities. In the late 1990s, he co-chaired a seminal report, with former New Brunswick Lieutenant Governor, Margaret McCain, for the Government of Ontario on early childhood learning. The report was issued as The Early Years Study - Reversing the Real Brain Drain on April 20, 1999. The report emphasized promoting early child development centres for young children and parents; boost spending on early childhood education to the same levels as kids in K to 12; focus on programs that are available to all income levels, because even the middle-class children need these services; and encourage local parent groups and businesses to set up these programs instead of the government, when possible. Recognition of this led Dr. Mustard and his colleagues to emphasize to all sectors of society the crucial nature of the early years to provide a healthy and competent population. A follow up report in the Early Years series was completed in 2007 by Mustard, McCain, and Dr. Stuart Shanker. The second report criticized Canada for being \\"dead last\\" in spending on early childhood education, and called for national early childhood development programs. =Early Years Study 3= A third instalment in the Early Years series, Early Years Study 3: Making decisions, taking action, was posthumously published simultaneously in Montreal and Toronto on November 22, 2011, only a few days after his death. The third report was co-authored with McCain and Kerry McCuaig, the Senior Policy Fellow at the Atkinson Centre, Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto. The main recommendation was that children as young as 2-years-old should start receiving formal education, due to the \\"avalanche of evidence\\". This education should be community-based, and voluntary, leaving parents to decide how much time they want their children in these programs. The report also revealed that even though the federal Canadian government cancelled a national childcare program back in 2007, full-day kindergarten has grown, mostly due to provincial governments funding these initiatives. It also introduced the Early Childhood Education Index, which measures 20 factors, arranged into five broad categories: integrated governance, funding, access, learning environment and accountability. Awards and recognition Mustard was involved with governments in Canada, Australia, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, UNICEF and the Aga Khan University in Pakistan in emphasizing the enormous importance to society of early childhood development. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1976, and the winner of the 1993 Sir John William Dawson Medal for his \\"varied and important contributions to Canadian academic and public life.\\" In 1985 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 1993. In 1992, he was appointed to the Order of Ontario. In 2003 he was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. He was a member of the board of PENCE (Protein Engineering Network Centre of Excellence), the Centre of Excellence of Early Child Development, the Aga Khan University in Karachi, Pakistan, Beatrice House (a residential program for homeless mothers and their children) and was Chairman Emeritus of the Council for Early Child Development.Packham, pp. 166‚Äì167\\" He was also the Past Chairman of Ballard Power Systems. In all, Mustard was the recipient of fifteen honorary degrees. In 2006 and 2007 he was a Thinker in Residence, a program in Adelaide, South Australia, which brings leaders in their fields to work with the South Australian community and government in developing new ideas and approaches to problem solving. A biography of his life, written by Marian Packham, entitled J. Fraser Mustard : Connections & Careers, was published in 2010. He died in Toronto, a month after his 84th birthday, on November 16, 2011. He was diagnosed with cancer of the ureter in October 2011, and it was the cause of his death. He was predeceased by his wife, Betty. Fraser Mustard Early Learning Academy in Toronto is named in his honour and opened in 2013.

The AN/AAQ-28(V) LITENING targeting pod is an advanced precision targeting pod system currently operational with a wide variety of aircraft worldwide. The research and development of the LITENING was first undertaken by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems' Missiles Division in Israel, with subsequent completion of LITENING I for use in the Israeli Air Force. LITENING significantly increases the combat effectiveness of the aircraft during day, night and under-the-weather conditions in the attack of ground and air targets with a variety of standoff weapons (i.e., laser-guided bombs, conventional bombs and GPS-guided weapons). The thousandth pod was sold in October 2010. Features LITENING is an integrated targeting pod that mounts externally to the aircraft. The targeting pod contains a high-resolution, forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor that displays an infrared image of the target to the aircrew; it has a wide field of view search capability and a narrow field of view acquisition/targeting capability of battlefield-sized targets. The pod also contains a CCD camera used to obtain target imagery in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. An on-gimbal inertial navigation sensor establishes line-of-sight and automatic boresighting capability. The pod is equipped with a laser designator for precise delivery of laser-guided munitions. A laser rangefinder provides information for various avionics systems, for example, navigation updates, weapon deliveries and target updates. The targeting pod includes an automatic target tracker to provide fully automatic stabilized target tracking at altitudes, airspeeds and slant ranges consistent with tactical weapon delivery maneuvers. These features simplify the functions of target detection and recognition, and permit attack of targets with precision-guided weapons on a single pass. Background The research and development program began at Rafael Advanced Defense Systems' Missiles Division in Israel, with subsequent completion of LITENING I for use in the Israeli Air Force. In 1995 Northrop Grumman Corporation teamed with Rafael for further development and sales of the LITENING pod. =Litening II/ER/AT= Northrop Grumman Corporation and Rafael Advanced Defence Systems completed product improvements on the \\"Basic Pod\\" including a third generation FLIR, laser marker and software upgrades (LITENING II) which was fielded beginning in 1999. Northrop Grumman and Rafael Advanced Defence Systems subsequently replaced the \\"320x256\\" FLIR with a latest technology \\"640x512\\" FLIR. This pod, known as LITENING ER, extended the target detection range and was fielded in 2001. The newest version, LITENING AT, is in production and was fielded in 2003. It further extends target detection and recognition ranges, improves the target coordinate generation accuracy, and provides multi-target cueing.U.S. Air Force Factsheet: LITENING II/ER/AT LITENING AT features a plug-and-play bay configured to accept a wide variety of data-links and recorders. Plug and Play II data-link capability offers increased range, digital data recording and an option to incorporate secure, two-way communications over ultra-high frequency (UHF) radios. LITENING's Plug and Play I, introduced in 2003, was the first data-link to be incorporated in a third generation targeting pod.Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman Delivers New Advanced Data-Link to U.S. Marine Corps for LITENING Targeting Pods =Litening G4= LITENING G4, which began to be delivered to U.S. forces in 2008, added new sensors for improved target identification and other advanced target recognition and identification features. The LITENING G4 provides significant enhancements in terms of both recognition range and image quality due to Rafaels' AVP imaging capability.Northrop Grumman Receives $120 Million Order to Supply LITENING Gen 4 Targeting Sensor Systems including RAFAEL AVP (Advanced Video Processor) System The G4's technologies include a full 1Kx1K forward looking infrared and charge-coupled device, as well as short wave infrared laser imaging sensors, color symbology, tracker improvement and enhanced zoom. The LITENING Gen 4 technology and capability is also available in a kit form that allows users to upgrade their currently fielded LITENING pods. The Royal Danish Air Force is the first international partner to take delivery of G4 pods. Rafael Advanced Systems announced on the eve of DefExpo 2014 a large order for 150+ LITENING targeting pods for the Indian Air Force's combat aircraft fleet. LITENING G4 pods have been chosen by the Indian Air Force for its frontline fighter aircraft, including the Su-30 MKI, MiG-29 and others. =Litening SE= LITENING SE provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, and recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data. This version includes a Plug-N-Play (PnP) III(TM) digital two-way, data link LRU inside the pod. The pods are being delivered as part of the United States Air Force's Advanced Targeting Pod ‚Äì Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) program.Northrop Grumman Awarded U.S. Air Force Contract to Provide LITENING SE Advanced Targeting Pods =Litening III= The Litening III, used on the UK's RAF Typhoon aircraft, as well as the Italian Air Force AMX, also provides still image capture for reconnaissance missions in addition to the targeting capabilities found on other models. =Future developments= Rafael sees an increased market in the future because of the move to stealth platforms which must have targeting systems built in. The company is developing a new model to compete for the F-35 requirement. At present prototype F-35's have the equivalent of a Lockheed Martin Sniper XR built in.

In all sorts of texts, such as laudatory poems, chronicles, and travelogues, writers have interpreted the how and why of certain circumstances. These texts are important for the knowledge of Javanese perspectives on the past. Scholars of Javanese history have paid much attention to theoretical questions, aiming at a balanced evaluation of Javanese historiography next to Western historiography. In doing so they focused on Old and Modern Javanese sources, drawing both on written sources and archaeological and epigraphic material. The debate continues up to the present. Babads Babads as a genre belong to the traditional literature. A characteristic of this kind of literature is that it is written in metrical form and is governed by a set of strict conventions. In traditional Javanese society, prose (gancaran) was not considered to be belles letters but was considered to be merely sets of notes or aide-m√©moires. This approach reflected the way in which literature was presented: text was not usually read in silence but, rather, was recited or sung to an audience. Every metre had its own particular melody or melodies to which it was sung, in harmony with the contents of the story. The word babad means 'a story about past events', 'text on the clearing of (the land...)', i.e. 'story about the origin of this or that settlement'. The Babad Basuki relates the clearing of the jungle and founding of a new settlement in Besuki (East Java), while the Babad Dipanegara relates the events connected with the insurrection of Diponegoro. Kakawin and kidung Kakawin are long epic poems in a defined metre inherited from Sanskrit poetic forms. Kidung are epic poems in Javanese metres.

Its highest point, which is in England, is 426 metres high. \\"Hergest\\" should be pronounced to rhyme with 'hardest' with a hard \\"g\\" (as in \\"garden\\"). The local dialect pronunciation of the name is actually \\"Hargest\\". The Red Book of Hergest is a medieval Welsh language manuscript stored in the Bodleian library in Oxford.  On Offa's Dyke Path  The Offa's Dyke Path waymarked long distance footpath leads along the ridge. The path passes close by the highest point of the ridge and the adjacent trig point.  Victorian racecourse  A disused Victorian circular country racecourse is sited on the hill. It is clearly marked on Ordnance Survey maps and is still visible on the ground. The racecourse was popular between 1825 and 1846. It replaced an earlier racecourse on nearby Bradnor Hill just to the north of Kington town, which dates from 1770. Horse races continued here in the summer until around 1880. With the panoramic views on all sides, they were popular with the local gentry, squirearchy and farming community.  Upland sheep grazing  During the Second World War the hill was cultivated, but has now reverted to rough sheep grazing and moorland, and is partly covered by bracken and gorse.  Inspiration  The ridge inspired an album by English multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield, Hergest Ridge. Oldfield was a resident of the area during the writing and recording of his albums Hergest Ridge and Ommadawn. Ommadawn was actually recorded in his nearby house, The Beacon. The albums were reissued with bonus material in June 2010. At the end of Ommadawn is a short song entitled On Horseback. The last lines of the lyrics are as follows: So if you feel a little glum, to Hergest Ridge you should come. In summer, winter, rain or sun, it's good to be on horseback.

The hill was also known as \\"The Lion's Flank\\", a term now obsolete. Together with Lion's Head, Signal Hill looks like a lion sphinx.Cape Town Magazine - Shooting in Cape Town with The Noon Gun  Signals  Signal flags were used to communicate weather warnings as well as anchoring instructions to visiting ships in order to ensure that they prepared adequately for stormy weather while in the bay. Similarly, ships could use flags to signal for assistance if, for example, an anchor line parted during a storm. It is known for the Noon Gun that is operated there by the South African Navy and South African Astronomical Observatory. In 1836, a time ball was set up at the Cape Town observatory, however it was not visible to ships in the harbour, so a second time ball was erected on Signal Hill in order to relay the precise moment of 1pm Cape Mean Time. In this way ships in the bay were able to check their marine chronometers. The daily practice of dropping of the ball continued until 1934, when it was made redundant by radio signals. The guns on Signal Hill were used to notify the public when a ship was in trouble and there was a possibility of casualties on the coast near Cape Town. Three guns would be fired from Chavonnes Battery, followed by a single gun in answer from Imhoff Battery.  Structures  A view of the kramat (tomb for a Muslim) towards Lion's Head from the Signal Hill hiking trail There is a road to the summit and that vantage point provides views over the Cape Town city centre and Atlantic Seaboard and surroundings, including at dawn or sunset. Along Signal Hill Road is the Appleton Scout Campsite operated by Scouts South Africa. There are several tombs, or kramats, on the hill for Muslim missionaries and religious leaders. The most conspicuous one, a white square building with a green dome, is for the sheikh Mohamed Hassen Ghaibie (Shah al- Qadri), a follower of Sheikh Yusuf. Other tombs consist of raised rectangles, decorated with satin. They are still visited by some local Muslim people. There is a parking lot on top of the signal Hill. There are simple things to eat and mats provided for watching the sunset.  Ecology  Signal Hill is one of the only places in the world where critically endangered Peninsula Shale Renosterveld vegetation can be found. Peninsula Shale Renosterveld used to be the dominant ecosystem of the Cape Town City Bowl, but was completely endemic, occurring nowhere else in the world.

He is known as the former keyboardist of No Devotion and former keyboardist, turntablist and supporting vocalist for the Welsh rock band Lostprophets. Early life Oliver and the band remotely knew each other, as they were part of the same music scene. Oliver used to play bass guitar in small local bands in his late teens, and was offered a place of the lead vocalist in Lee Gaze's first band Fleshbind; he declined the offer as he had to go to university. Career =Musician career= The band have stated that Oliver was only added to the band so he could go on tour with them as a photographer, for they were impressed by his work. The band asked their management if they could bring Oliver on tour with them in 2000. They were told they could not afford to take someone who was not part of the band or their crew with them, so Oliver bought a set of turntables and quickly learnt what he needed to play. It is unclear how this occurrence coincides with ex-turntablist DJ Stepzak's departure from the band. As the band themselves worked on the remastered The Fake Sound of Progress, it can be assumed that the notably larger changes in the turntable and sample parts (recorded by Stepzak) compared to the other instruments is due to Oliver's influence on the record. Oliver was also the keyboard and synthesizer player and founding member of the Welsh/American alternative rock band, No Devotion, whose debut album was released in September 2015 and won the Kerrang! Award for Best Album. He departed the band in 2017 to focus on his art career. =Artist career= Oliver is also an aspiring artist and had made quite a successful career before joining Lostprophets. Some of his works have been known to sell for up to ¬£5000 each. He studied fine art at the University of the West of England, Bristol. As an adolescent he used to take photos of small town life in his Welsh village of Cilfynydd, in the community of Pontypridd, and painted them back on canvas. Then, as a student, he took interest in adapting the Tales of Mabinogion, traditional Welsh tales, into modern scenes. Oliver has worked with Ian Watkins on all of Lostprophets' artwork since 2003, possibly before, and he drew the pictures found in the booklet of the album Start Something (also used on covers for the \\"Burn Burn\\" single) personally. From 2009, he started to paint again, stating that his new works allowed him to express himself much better as an artist than his older works did. His newer works mostly represent children finding themselves alone in landscapes of war or desolation. Oliver attributes this recurring theme to the fears brought by fatherhood in our current world state. He also mentioned the study of Taoism and meditation helped him develop the new expression technique. Oliver's first showing in America opened in Los Angeles at the Known Gallery, in January 2013, displaying most of his newer works. Oliver also collaborated with the association skate4cancer, painting the piece \\"Dream, Love, Cure\\" and selling prints for the charity. Personal life Oliver currently resides in Los Angeles, a few streets away from bandmate Mike Lewis, with his wife and sons, his second son being born in early February 2013.

Geography The municipal area, with the second largest in Carinthia, covers most of the Maltatal valley, stretching from the Ankogel Group of the Hohe Tauern range in the northwest down to the town of Gm√ºnd on the Lieser river, a tributary of the Drava. In the southwest it borders on the Rei√üeck municipality, while the Alpine crest including the Ankogel and Hochalmspitze peaks forms the northern border with the Austrian state of Salzburg. It includes the cadastral communities (Katastralgemeinden) of Dornbach, Malta proper, and Maltaberg. Parish church Formerly an agricultural area, the local economy today largely depends on tourism with about 120,000 overnight stays per year. Attractions include a former provost's cottage (turned into an open-air museum) and the Fallbach Klettersteig, a via ferrata along the Fallbach Waterfal. In 1987 the Nationalpark Hohe Tauern was extended as far as the Ankogel Group and today, some 85.7 square kilometres of the municipal area are part of the national park territory. History Already settled in pre-Roman times, the first documented mention of Malta was between 957 and 992 under the name locus Malontina. In the 11th century, √ñdenfest Castle was erected on the northern slopes of the Maltatal valley, then held by ministeriales of the Bishops of Brixen. It was devastated in the early 14th century, when the local Counts of Malta revolted against the Meinhardiner dukes of Carinthia. A first church beneath the castle was mentioned between 1006 and 1039. The Gothic parish church of Maria Hilf Assumptio was built in various stages between the 13th and the 15th centuries. It has a Roman gravestone set into the wall, 15th-century paintings in the vaults, and 14th-century frescoes on the walls of the choir. In the neighbourhood is the Dornbach water castle (originally Gothic, but with alterations added in the 16th century); it is surrounded by a circuit of walls and a moat. The village of Fischertratten is centered on a Protestant church, erected upon the Patent of Toleration in 1787. K√∂lnbrein Dam  K√∂lnbrein reservoir with Hochalmspitze and Ankogel peaks The Hochalm mountain road up the steep Malta valley leads to the K√∂lnbrein arch dam, part of the Malta hydroelectric plant run by the Verbund power company. Tunnels lead the water to the power stations in the M√∂ll valley at Rei√üeck over 1100 m (3610 ft) below. The dam collects a large amount of water from the surrounding mountains and also by a system of water supply tunnels bringing water from the Lieser and M√∂ll rivers. The masonry dam built between 1971 and 1978 with a length of 626 m (2053 ft) reaches a height above ground of 200 m (656 ft) and therefore is the tallest in Austria. The reservoir extends 4.5 km (2.8 mi) behind the dam, holding approximately 200 million m¬≥ of water. Adjacent to the dam is a restaurant and a hotel. The reservoir serves competitive rowers for altitude training while the dam is a popular bungee jumping venue.

It is a street food that has become quite popular in Taiwan and can be found in night markets or mini food stalls throughout Taiwan. The common ingredients are flour, water, and a leavening agent for the outer dough shell, and a meat protein (usually pork or beef) marinated with sugar, soy sauce, white pepper or black pepper, and scallion for the inside filling. Origin It is not known who invented the h√∫jiƒÅob«êng. The dish can be found in Fuzhou and in Taiwan. Taiwanese vendors list the item as \\"Fuzhou Pepper Bun\\" () and credit the creation of the bun to Fuzhounese immigrants. Many of the oldest pepper bun vendors were established by those of Fuzhounese ancestry. Preparation Inside of cooked H√∫jiƒÅo b«êng. The outer dough shell is prepared with flour, water, and a leavening agent such as yeast or baking powder. Lard, butter or oil is sometime added to the dough to make the bun extra crunchy and flaky like a croissant when cooked. The outer shell dough is then individually rolled to a thin circular shape, similar to a dumpling wrapping. The main ingredients of the filling are meat which is usually pork. The meat is either ground or sliced thinly. Some vendors use ground and sliced meat to give the bun a bite to it, but ground meat is usually used since it produces more juice when cooked. The meat is usually marinated with a heaping of white or black pepper powder, soy sauce, sugar and cooking wine. Some vendors also add five-spice powder or curry powder to the meat marinade. The marinated meat is spread on the thin dough. A handful of cut green scallions is then placed on top of the meat and sealed up with the dough. The scallions must be added in a separate step - never mixed into the meat filling - to produce a clear scallion taste to the bun. Unlike other buns, the sealed end is on the bottom. The top of the bun is then brushed with water and finished with a sprinkling of white sesame seeds. H√∫jiƒÅo b«êng being baked in an oven. The buns are then baked in a cylindrical, high-heat, clay oven that is similar to a tandoori oven. Burning charcoal is put at the bottom to heat the oven. The buns are then stacked vertically along the side of the oven, from bottom to top. To remove the finished buns, a flat object such as a blunt knife or spatula is used to scrape the bun off of the side of the oven. A colander is then used to catch the buns to prevent them from falling into the charcoal pit at the bottom of the oven. The cooked bun has a crunchy, thin dough, almost cracker like. When bitten into, meat juices pour out. Due to the way that the bun is wrapped, the green scallions are at the center of the bun with the meat wrapped around them, instead of at the bottom. Popularity The H√∫jiƒÅo b«êng first started gaining popularity outside of Taiwan when it was featured on tourist programs such as Anthony Bourdain's The Layover. Also Hong Kong's TVB channel foodie show Neighborhood Gourmet season 3. The item soon became a tourist must try when visiting Taiwan. Tourist who visited Taiwan and had tasted the bun would blog about it. The wait to buy a H√∫jiƒÅo b«êng is notoriously long during peak hours at any vendors, the average wait is usually 30 minutes minimum. Customers also always buy in batches due to the long wait in line. When the vendor sell out and runs out of ingredients they usually close shop for the day instead restocking their ingredients to make more buns.

The ring of air as well as the nearby water spins poloidally as it travels through the water, much like a flexible bracelet might spin when it is rolled on to a person's arm. The faster the bubble ring spins, the more stable it becomes. Bubble rings and smoke rings are both examples of vortex rings‚Äîthe physics of which is still under active study in fluid dynamics. Devices have been invented which generate bubble vortex rings.United States Patent: Simple method for the controlled production of VORTEX ring bubbles of a gas Issued patent: 6824125, 30 November 2004.United States Patent: Simple, mechanism-free device, and method to produce VORTEX ring bubbles in liquids Patent number: 7300040. 27 November 2007. Physics As the bubble ring rises, a lift force pointing downward that is generated by the vorticity, acts on the bubble in order to counteract the buoyancy force. This reduces the bubble's velocity and increases its diameter. The ring becomes thinner, despite the total volume inside the bubble increasing as the external water pressure decreases. Bubble rings fragment into rings of spherical bubbles when the ring becomes thinner than a few millimetres. This is due to Plateau-Rayleigh instability. When the bubble reaches a certain thickness, surface tension effects distort the bubble's surface pulling it apart into separate bubbles. Circulation of the fluid around the bubble helps to stabilize the bubble for a longer duration, counteracting the effects of Plateau-Rayleigh instability. Below is the equation for Plateau-Rayleigh instability with circulation as a stabilizing term: :: \\\\omega^2= \\\\left ( \\\\frac{-ka \\\\, K_1(ka)}{K_0(ka)} \\\\right ) \\\\left [ (1-k^2 a^2) \\\\frac{T}{pa^3} - \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma^2}{4\\\\pi^2 a^4} \\\\right ] where \\\\omega is the growth rate, k is the wave number, a is the radius of the bubble cylinder, T is the surface tension, \\\\Gamma is the circulation, and K_n(x) is the modified Bessel function of the second kind of order n. When \\\\omega is positive, the bubble is stable due to circulation and when \\\\omega is negative, surface tension effects destabilize it and break it up. Circulation also has an effect on the velocity and radial expansion of the bubble. Circulation increases the velocity while reducing the rate of radial expansion. Radial expansion however is what diffuses energy by stretching the vortex. Instability happens more quickly in turbulent water, but in calm water, divers can achieve an external diameter of a meter or more before the bubble fragments. =Buoyancy induced toroidal bubbles= As an air bubble rises, there is a difference in pressure between the top and bottom of the bubble. The higher pressure at the bottom of the bubble pushes the bubble's bottom surface up faster than the top surface rises. This creates a fluid jet that moves up through the center of the bubble. If the fluid jet has enough energy, it will puncture the top of the bubble and create a bubble ring. Because of the motion of the fluid moving through the center of the bubble, the bubble begins to rotate. This rotation moves the fluid around the bubble creating a toroidal vortex. If the surface tension of the fluid interface or the viscosity of the liquid is too high, then the liquid jet will be more broad and will not penetrate the top of the bubble. This results in a spherical cap bubble. Air bubbles with a diameter greater than about two centimeters become toroidal in shape due to the pressure differences.. =Cavitation bubbles= Cavitation bubbles, when near a solid surface, can also become a torus. The area away from the surface has an increased static pressure causing a high pressure jet to develop. This jet is directed towards the solid surface and breaks through the bubble to form a torus shaped bubble for a short period of time. This generates multiple shock waves that can damage the surface. File:Vortex_ring.gifA bubble ring forms a vortex ring, shaped like a doughnut which spins poloidally in the direction of the arrows File:Bubble-ring- spin.pngThe bubble ring travels in the same direction its innermost side rotates File:Nicobulle.JPGAn underwater diver blows a bubble ring Cetaceans Cetaceans, such as beluga whales, dolphins and humpback whales, blow bubble rings. Dolphins sometimes engage in complex play behaviours, creating bubble rings on purpose, seemingly for amusement. There are two main methods of bubble ring production: rapid puffing of a burst of air into the water and allowing it to rise to the surface, forming a ring; or creating a toroidal vortex with their flukes and injecting a bubble into the helical vortex currents thus formed. The dolphin will often then examine its creation visually and with sonar. They will sometimes play with the bubbles, distorting the bubble rings, breaking smaller bubble rings off of the original or splitting the original ring into two separate rings using their beak. They also appear to enjoy biting the vortex-rings they've created, so that they burst into many separate normal bubbles and then rise quickly to the surface. Dolphins also have the ability to form bubble rings with their flukes by using the reservoir of air at the surface.

Human divers Boy blowing soap bubbles from a bubble ring Some scuba divers and freedivers can create bubble rings by blowing air out of their mouth in a particular manner. Long bubble rings also can form spontaneously in turbulent water such as heavy surf. Other uses of the term The term \\"bubble ring\\" is also used in other contexts. A common children's toy for blowing soap bubbles is called a bubble ring, and replaces the bubble pipe toy that was traditionally used for many years because the bubble pipe can be perceived as too reminiscent of smoking and therefore a bad example for children.

It was the first film to be released by Gar Bo Motion Picture Company (aka Gar-Bo Film Company), an independent production company set up by Hung, Lau and producer Karl Maka. The fight scenes are mainly weapon-based, with particular emphasis on the contrast between the dao (sword) and qiang (spear). The film is sometimes listed as The Odd Couple. Plot the film sets in the Manchu era.Two aging martial artists get together once a year for a timed duel. One is master of the short sword, King of Sabres (Sammo Hung), and the other is King of Spears (Lau Kar Wing). Every year the fight ends in a draw, and as the masters are getting old, they decide the best course of action is to each take on a student to determine who is the better teacher. They agree to meet up again 10 years later, with their students and let the next generation carry on the duel. A previously upright martial artist known as Old Yellow Dog (Bryan Leung) kidnaps the students (also played by Lau and Hung) before their duel can begin. It transpires in a flashback that the master was defeated in separate battles with the King of Sabres and the King of Spears, and was forced to retire from fighting. Now, after years of training in the long bladed staff and with a new name, Laughing Bandit, he wants to lure the old masters out to exact his revenge. The old masters arrive, first taking on the Laughing Bandit's four disciples and killing them. However, this was a ploy to tire them out, and individually they are unable to defeat Laughing Bandit and his new techniques. The evil master suggests the old men both attack at once, but because of their pride and belief in their own superiority, they refuse. The students are released, while each master is fighting, and are instructed to escape. After some protestation they do, and the old masters are killed. Fuelled by revenge, the students agree to join forces to defeat the evil master. Hung's character (the new King of Spears) comes up with a plan us to use magnets that can pull the Laughing Bandit's weapon from him. After luring him out into the open, they fight him unarmed, choosing to mimic their weapon styles with empty hands, but with the magnet they are able to disrupt his attacks, and after a gruelling fight they triumph. They kill the evil master. After burying their masters, they decide to honour their memory by fulfilling their request to duel. However, as with their masters before them, the fight ends in a draw. Instead, they decide to resolve who is the greatest by playing a game, rather than fighting. Each must try to place his weapon into their masters burial mound, whilst simultaneously stopping their opponent from doing so. After another long competition, the film ends with the pair laughing at the absurdity of the rivalry and realising that as friends they will never be able to determine who is the best.

History The I&M; Rail Link, owned by the Washington Corporation, operated 1,385 miles of trackage in the states of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin. The lines were acquired from the Canadian Pacific Railway, which were originally built by the Milwaukee Road and its predecessors. The railroad commenced operations at 12:01 p.m. April 5, 1997. Canadian Pacific Railway retained a 33% ownership in the new company and the Washington Corporation obtained the remaining 67%. The new railroad was headquartered in Davenport, Iowa, with Nahant Yard becoming the base for most operations and locomotive maintenance. Heavy locomotive repairs were handled by National Railway Equipment in Silvis, Illinois. Train dispatching was first handled by the Canadian Pacific, but those duties were later performed by the Montana Rail Link in Missoula, Montana, which is another Washington subsidiary. IMRL's principal commodities included steel, coal, agricultural and chemical products. The railroad operated with 2,284 freight cars and 118 locomotives. Train operations continued much as they did during Soo Line and CP Rail ownership. In late 2001 Washington looked to divest itself of the railroad, stating it was unprofitable.

Almost a century after the final murder, the suspect \\"Kosminski\\" was identified as Aaron Kosminski; but there was little evidence to connect him with the \\"Kosminski\\" who was suspected of the murders, and their dates of death are different. Possibly, Kosminski was confused with another Polish Jew of the same age named Aaron or David Cohen (real name possibly Nathan Kaminsky), who was a violent patient at the Colney Hatch Asylum. In September 2014, author Russell Edwards claimed to have proved Kosminski's guilt using mitochondrial DNA evidence from a shawl he believed to have been left at a murder scene. A peer-reviewed article on the DNA analysis was published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences in 2019. However, scientists from Innsbruck Medical University have criticised the paper and its conclusions, pointing to a number of mistakes and assumptions made by its authors.  Life  Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum, North London. Kosminski was an inmate from 1891 to 1894. Aaron Kosminski was born in K≈Çodawa in Congress Poland, then part of the Russian Empire. His parents were Abram J√≥zef Kozmi≈Ñski, a tailor, and his wife Golda n√©e Lubnowska. He may have been employed in a hospital as a hairdresser or orderly for a time. He emigrated from Poland in 1880 or 1881, likely with his sisters' families. The family initially lived in Germany. A nephew of his was born there in 1880 and a niece in 1881. It is not known precisely when Aaron left Poland to join his sisters or whether he lived in Germany for any length of time, although he may have left Poland as a result of the April 1881 pogroms following the assassination of Tsar Alexander II, the impetus for many other Jews to emigrate. The family moved to Britain and settled in London sometime in 1881 or 1882. His mother, who was listed as a widow, apparently did not emigrate with the family immediately, but had joined them by 1894. It is unknown whether his father died or abandoned the family, but he did not emigrate to Britain with the rest of them. It is known that he had likely died before 1901, and an 1887 death certificate indicates that an Abram Kosminski had died in the Polish town of Ko≈Ço, only five miles from Grzegorzew, the hometown of Kosminski's father.Begg, pp. 269‚Äì273 In London, Kosminski embarked on a career as a barber in Whitechapel, an impoverished slum in London's East End that had become home to many Jewish refugees who were fleeing economic hardship in Eastern Europe and pogroms in Tsarist Russia. However, he may have worked only sporadically: it was reported that he had \\"not attempted any kind of work for years\\" by 1891. He possibly relied on his sisters' families for financial support, and may have lived with them at 3 Sion Square in 1890 and 16 Greenfield Street in 1891, indicating that his sisters possibly shared responsibility for caring for him and he alternated living between their family homes. On 12 July 1890, Kosminski was placed in Mile End Old Town workhouse due to his worsening mental illness, with his brother Woolf certifying the entry, and was released three days later. On 4 February 1891, he was returned to the workhouse, possibly by the police, and on 7 February, he was transferred to Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum. A witness to the certification of his entry, recorded as Jacob Cohen, gave some basic background information and stated that Kosminski had threatened his sister with a knife. It is unclear whether this meant Kosminski's sister or Cohen's. Kosminski remained at the Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum for the next three years until he was admitted on 19 April 1894 to Leavesden Asylum.Colney Hatch Register of Admissions, quoted in Begg, pp. 269‚Äì270 Case notes indicate that Kosminski had been ill since at least 1885. His insanity took the form of auditory hallucinations, a paranoid fear of being fed by other people that drove him to pick up and eat food dropped as litter, and a refusal to wash or bathe.Asylum case notes quoted by Begg, p. 270; Fido, p. 216 and Rumbelow, p. 180 The cause of his insanity was recorded as \\"self-abuse\\", which is thought to be a euphemism for masturbation. His poor diet seems to have kept him in an emaciated state for years; his low weight was recorded in the asylum case notes. By February 1919, he weighed just . He died the following month, aged 53.  Jack the Ripper suspect  The 1894 memorandum written by Sir Melville Macnaghten, Assistant Chief Constable of the London Metropolitan Police, naming \\"Kosminski\\" as one of three suspects in the Jack the Ripper case. The other two suspects he named were Montague Druitt and Michael Ostrog. Between 1888 and 1891, the deaths of 11 women in or around the Whitechapel district of the East End of London were linked together in a single police investigation known as the \\"Whitechapel murders\\". Seven of the victims suffered a slash to the throat, and in four cases the bodies were mutilated after death. Five of the cases, between August and November 1888, show such marked similarities that they are generally agreed to be the work of a single serial killer, known as \\"Jack the Ripper\\". Despite an extensive police investigation, the Ripper was never identified and the crimes remained unsolved. Years after the end of the murders, documents were discovered that revealed the suspicions of police officials against a man called \\"Kosminski\\". An 1894 memorandum written by Sir Melville Macnaghten, the Assistant Chief Constable of the London Metropolitan Police, names one of the suspects as a Polish Jew called \\"Kosminski\\" (without a forename). Macnaghten's memo was discovered in the private papers of his daughter, Lady Aberconway, by television journalist Dan Farson in 1959,Woods and Baddeley, p. 125 and an abridged version from the archives of the Metropolitan Police was released to the public in the 1970s. Macnaghten stated that there were strong reasons for suspecting \\"Kosminski\\" because he \\"had a great hatred of women ... with strong homicidal tendencies\\".Macnaghten's notes quoted by Evans and Skinner, pp. 584‚Äì587; Fido, p. 147 and Rumbelow, p. 142 In 1910, Assistant Commissioner Sir Robert Anderson claimed in his memoirs The Lighter Side of My Official Life that the Ripper was a \\"low-class Polish Jew\\".Quoted in Begg, p. 266; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 236 and Evans and Skinner, pp. 626‚Äì633 Chief Inspector Donald Swanson, who led the Ripper investigation, named the man as \\"Kosminski\\" in notes handwritten in the margin of his presentation copy of Anderson's memoirs.Begg, p. 269; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 243; Evans and Skinner, p. 635; Rumbelow, p. 179 He added that \\"Kosminski\\" had been watched at his brother's home in Whitechapel by the police, that he was taken with his hands tied behind his back to the workhouse and then to Colney Hatch Asylum, and that he died shortly after.Begg, p. 269; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 253; Evans and Skinner, p. 635; Rumbelow, p. 179 The copy of Anderson's memoirs containing the handwritten notes by Swanson was donated by his descendants to Scotland Yard's Crime Museum in 2006. In 1987, Ripper author Martin Fido searched asylum records for any inmates called Kosminski, and found only one: Aaron Kosminski.Begg, p. 269; Fido, p. 215 At the time of the murders, Aaron apparently lived either on Providence Street or Greenfield Street, both of which addresses are close to the sites of the murders.Marriott, p. 238 The addresses given in the asylum records are in Mile End Old Town, just on the edge of Whitechapel.Begg, pp. 269‚Äì270 The description of Aaron Kosminski's symptoms in the case notes indicates that he had paranoid schizophrenia. Macnaghten's notes say that \\"Kosminski\\" indulged in \\"solitary vices\\", and in his memoirs Anderson wrote of his suspect's \\"unmentionable vices\\",Fido, p. 170 both of which may match the claim in the case notes that Aaron Kosminski committed \\"self-abuse\\".e.g. Fido, p. 229 Swanson's notes match the known details of Aaron Kosminski's life in that he reported that the suspect went to the workhouse and then to Colney Hatch,Begg, p. 273 but the last detail about his early death does not match Aaron Kosminski, who lived until 1919 (see #Kosminski and \\"David Cohen\\").Whitehead and Rivett, p. 109 Anderson claimed that the Ripper had been identified by the \\"only person who had ever had a good view of the murderer\\", but that no prosecution was possible because both the witness and the culprit were Jews and Jews were not willing to offer testimony against fellow Jews. Swanson's notes state that \\"Kosminski\\" was identified at \\"the Seaside Home\\", which was the Police Convalescent Home in Brighton. Some authors express scepticism that this identification ever happened, while others use it as evidence for their theories. For example, Donald Rumbelow thought the story unlikely,Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 249‚Äì253; Rumbelow, p. 182 but fellow Ripper authors Martin Fido and Paul Begg thought there was another witness, perhaps Israel Schwartz,Begg, p. 276 Joseph Lawende, or a policeman.Fido, pp. 77, 152, 207 In his memorandum, however, Macnaghten stated that \\"no-one ever saw the Whitechapel murderer\\", which directly contradicts Anderson's and Swanson's recollection.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 255 Sir Henry Smith, Acting Commissioner of the City of London Police at the time of the murders, scathingly dismissed Anderson's claim that Jews would not testify against one another in his own memoirs written later in the same year, calling it a \\"reckless accusation\\" against Jews.Wilson and Odell, p. 78 Edmund Reid, the initial inspector in charge of the investigation, also challenged Anderson's opinion.Interview with Reid in the Morning Advertiser, 23 April 1910, quoted in Cook, p. 178 There is no record of Aaron Kosminski in any surviving official police documents except Macnaghten's memo.Evans and Skinner, pp. 262, 604 In Kosminski's defence, he was described as harmless in the asylum. He had originally been taken into custody for threatening either his sister or the sister of a witness to his admittance with a knife, and brandished a chair at an asylum attendant in January 1892, but these two incidents are the only known indications of violent behaviour.Fido, p. 228; Rumbelow, p. 182; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 108 In the asylum, Kosminski preferred to speak his native language, Yiddish, which indicates that his English may have been poor, and that he was unable to persuade English- speaking victims into dark alleyways, as the Ripper was supposed to do.Marriott, pp. 237, 240 However, the \\"canonical five\\" killings that are most frequently blamed on the Ripper concluded in 1888; Kosminski's movements were not restricted until 1891.Whitehead and Rivett, p. 108  DNA evidence claims =2014 Louhelainen Study= On 7 September 2014, Dr. Jari Louhelainen, an expert in historic DNA analysis, announced that he had been commissioned by British author Russell Edwards to study a shawl said to have been found with victim Catherine Eddowes and that he had extracted mitochondrial DNA that matches female line descendants of Eddowes, and mitochondrial DNA that matches female line descendants of Kosminski's sister from the shawl. Louhelainen stated that: \\"The first strand of DNA showed a 99.2 percent match, as the analysis instrument could not determine the sequence of the missing 0.8 percent fragment of DNA. On testing the second strand, we achieved a perfect 100 percent match.\\" In his book Naming Jack The Ripper, Edwards names Kosminski as Jack the Ripper. Edwards was inspired to try to solve the case after the release of From Hell, the 2001 Johnny Depp film about the Whitechapel murders. He bought the shawl at auction and commissioned Louhelainen, with Dr. David Miller assisting, to analyse it for forensic DNA evidence. Edwards states that Kosminski was on a list of police suspects but there was never enough evidence to bring him to trial at the time. Kosminski died at the age of 53 of gangrene of the leg in a London mental hospital in 1919. He said that the DNA samples proved that Kosminski was \\"definitely, categorically and absolutely\\" the person responsible for the Whitechapel murders committed by Jack the Ripper. \\"I've got the only piece of forensic evidence in the whole history of the case,\\" he told The Independent. He continued, \\"I've spent 14 years working on it, and we have definitively solved the mystery of who Jack the Ripper was. Only non-believers that want to perpetuate the myth will doubt. This is it now‚Äîwe have unmasked him\\". Criticism of the report included complaints that the findings first appeared in Britain's tabloid Daily Mail newspaper. One critic, Susannah L. Bodman of The Oregonian said \\"The Daily Mails reporting on science and scientific evidence is‚Äîlet's say‚Äînot known to be robust.\\" Other criticisms include questions about \\"the chain of evidence or provenance on the shawl\\", that publishing the information in the press \\"is not the same as reporting and publishing your methods in a peer-reviewed journal\\", and concerns regarding the entire recent body of Jack the Ripper investigative and historical forensic work in general, notably how often the work of mediums and clairvoyants, human interest angles, recycled evidence from coroner's courts and other sources and the general acceptance of misinformation and urban myth as fact have undermined and hobbled previous efforts to conduct objective, scientific investigations. Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys, the forensic scientist who invented DNA fingerprinting in 1984, initially commented that the find was: \\"an interesting but remarkable claim that needs to be subjected to peer review, with detailed analysis of the provenance of the shawl and the nature of the claimed DNA match with the perpetrator's descendants and its power of discrimination\\". Jeffreys and others later stated that a claim presented in the book as a statistically significant match with the DNA from Eddowes's descendant‚Äîa sequence variation described as 314.1C and claimed to be rare‚Äîwas the result of an error in nomenclature for the common sequence variation 315.1C, which is present in more than 99% of people of European descent. Former City of London Police officer and crime historian Donald Rumbelow criticised the claim that the evidence proved Kosminski was Jack the Ripper, saying that no shawl is listed among Eddowes's effects by the police. Mitochondrial DNA expert Peter Gill said the shawl \\"is of dubious origin and has been handled by several people who could have shared that mitochondrial DNA profile\\". The shawl or other material could have been contaminated before or while DNA was being tested; two of Eddowes's descendants are known to have been in the same room as the shawl for three days in 2007, and, in the words of one critic, \\"The shawl has been openly handled by loads of people and been touched, breathed on, spat upon\\". Despite the criticisms, Louhelainen continued to defend his work. =2019 Louhelainen Study= Louhelainen's 2014 findings were criticised as they had not been subject to peer review by other scientists or investigators. In March 2019, the Journal of Forensic Sciences published a study analysing the mitochondrial DNA from cells extracted from a shawl claimed to have been found near the body of victim Catherine Eddowes, as well as samples from maternal descendants of the victim and suspect (Kosminski). This study, conducted by scientists at Liverpool John Moores University and the University of Leeds, stated in its conclusion that \\"the presence of mtDNA on the shawl matches the female victim's mtDNA derived from stains on it and that mtDNA also on the shawl matches the suspect candidate's mtDNA\\".  Kosminski and \\"David Cohen\\"  Newspaper broadsheet referring to the Whitechapel murderer as \\"Leather Apron\\", September 1888 Another Polish Jew proposed as a suspect in the Jack the Ripper murders was Aaron Davis Cohen or David Cohen, whose incarceration at Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum roughly coincided with the end of the murders. He was committed on 12 December 1888, about one month after the murder of Mary Jane Kelly on 9 November. He was described as violently antisocial, exhibited destructive tendencies while at the asylum, and had to be restrained. He was the same age as Kosminski, and died at the asylum in October 1889.Fido, pp. 219‚Äì220 Author Martin Fido suggested in his book The Crimes, Detection and Death of Jack the Ripper (1987) that the name \\"David Cohen\\" was used by the asylum as a simple name for an inmate whose true name (Kosminski or Kaminsky) was too difficult to spell or easily misunderstood.Fido, pp. 219, 231 Fido identified Cohen with \\"Leather Apron\\", a Polish Jewish bootmaker blamed for the murders in local gossip, and speculated that Cohen's true identity was Nathan Kaminsky, a bootmaker living in Whitechapel who had been treated at one time for syphilis. Fido was unable to trace Kaminsky after May 1888, and records of Cohen began that December.Fido, pp. 216‚Äì219 Fido suggested that police officials confused the name Kaminsky with Kosminski, resulting in the wrong man coming under suspicion. As with Kosminski, the asylum case notes say he spoke only Yiddish.Fido, p. 220 The implication is that Kaminsky's syphilis was not cured in May 1888 but in remission, and he began to kill prostitutes as an act of revenge because it had affected his brain. However, Cohen's death certificate makes no mention of syphilis but gives the cause of death as \\"exhaustion of mania\\" with phthisis, a then prevalent form of pulmonary tuberculosis, as the secondary cause. Kaminsky might have died as an \\"unknown\\" as hundreds of people did each year in the late 19th century. That would account for Fido's inability to find a record of his death in England and Wales during the probable period of his life.Kendell, p. 80 Nigel Cawthorne dismissed Cohen as a likely suspect because in the asylum his assaults were undirected, and his behaviour was wild and uncontrolled, whereas the Ripper seemed to attack specifically and quietly.Cawthorne, Nigel (2000) \\"Foreword\\", in Knight, p. 2 In contrast, former FBI criminal profiler John Douglas said in his book The Cases That Haunt Us that behavioural clues gathered from the murders all point to a person \\"known to the police as David Cohen ... or someone very much like him\\".

It lies approximately , by road, southeast of Victoria Falls, the nearest large town. The town lies on the railway line from Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second-largest city, to Victoria Falls. Hwange sits at an elevation of , above sea level. Overview The town houses the offices of Hwange Town Council, as well as the headquarters of Hwange District Administration. Hwange and the surrounding countryside is a centre for the industry in Zimbabwe. Hwange Colliery is the largest in the country, with proven reserves that are estimated to last over 1,000 years, at current production levels. The Wankie Coal Field, one of the largest in the world, was discovered here in 1895 by the American Scout Frederick Russell Burnham. Today the coal for the whole country is transported by the mining railway to Thomson Junction, where it is handed over to the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) for onward transmission. In 2010, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique signed an agreement to develop a railway for the export of coal to Technobanine Point near Maputo. The cost per tonne of rail transport to the coast amounts to ten times the coast of extraction. Hwange is also a tourism centre due to the presence of the nearby Hwange National Park, the largest National Park in Zimbabwe. The national park is home to a vast number of elephant, giraffe, lion and other wildlife. Royal Bank Zimbabwe, a commercial bank, maintains a branch in the town. Branches of Royal Bank Zimbabwe Zimbabwe's biggest power plant, Hwange Thermal Power Station, was built here in the 1980s. History The town is named after the chieftain of Zwange, who is now called Chief Hwange. The town was known as Wankie until 1982. =Wankie Coal Mine Disaster= In June 1972, the deadliest mining disaster in the country's history took place when an underground explosion occurred in Wankie No.2 Colliery. Four hundred and twenty-seven miners lost their lives; three hundred and ninety-one Africans and thirty-six Europeans. Apart from the one hundred and seventy-six Rhodesians who died, there were ninety-one Zambians, fifty-two from Mozambique üá≤üáø , thirty-seven from Malawi, thirty Tanzanians, thirteen from South West Africa, and one from Botswana üáßüáº . Population The current population of the town in not publicly known. According to the 1992 Population Census, the town had a population of 42,581. In 2015, the population of Hwange was estimated at 38,000.Next Population Census In Zimbabwe Scheduled For August 2012 Climate Sports First-class cricket has been played in Hwange, at the well established cricket venue located in the town, the Tom Kenton Oval, home of the Hwange (Wankie) cricket club. Earlier called the Wankie Oval. Hwange Colliery F.C. (formerly known as Wankie Colliery F.C.) is a Hwange- based Premier Soccer League club, promoted to division One in 2009.

The Vergilius Augusteus is a manuscript from late antiquity, containing the works of the Roman author Virgil, written probably around the 4th century. There are two other collections of Virgil manuscripts, the Vergilius Vaticanus and the Vergilius Romanus. They are early examples of illuminated manuscripts; the Augusteus is not illuminated but has decorated initial letters at the top of each page. These letters do not mark divisions of the text, but rather are used at the beginning of whatever line happened to fall at the top of the page. These decorated initials are the earliest surviving such initials. Only seven leaves of the manuscript survives, four of which are in the Vatican Library (MS Vat. lat. 3256), and the remaining three in the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin (Lat. fol. 416). The leaves contain fragments of Virgil's Georgics and the Aeneid. The fragments themselves are unremarkable, but they are written in Roman square capitals, which shows that square capitals were used in handwriting and not only for stone inscriptions. Due to its great age, it was originally believed that the manuscript was written in the time of Roman emperor Caesar Augustus, hence its name. In the later Middle Ages the manuscript was kept in the abbey of St. Denis in Paris.  References  *Alexander, J. J. G.: The Decorated Letter. New York, 1978. *Carl Nordenfalk: Vergilius Augusteus.

He came from an upper-middle-class English background, and studied at Winchester College and the University of Oxford. After graduating, he was employed as an assistant schoolmaster at a boarding school and pursued a parallel career in the law, qualifying as a barrister in 1885. His main interest outside work was cricket, which he played with many leading players of the time, including Lord Harris and Francis Lacey. In November 1888, he lost his post at the school for reasons that remain unclear. One month later his body was discovered drowned in the River Thames. His death, which was found to be a suicide, roughly coincided with the end of the murders attributed to Jack the Ripper. Private suggestions in the 1890s that he could have committed the crimes became public knowledge in the 1960s and led to the publication of books that proposed him as the murderer. The evidence against him was entirely circumstantial, however, and many writers from the 1970s onwards have rejected him as a likely suspect.

His father had promised him a legacy of ¬£500 (equivalent to ¬£ today), and Druitt paid his membership fees with a loan from his father secured against the inheritance.Begg, The Definitive History, p. 259; Cullen, p. 227; Leighton, p. 32; McDonald, p. 89; Rumbelow, pp. 154‚Äì155 He was called to the bar on 29 April 1885, and set up a practice as a barrister and special pleader.Begg, The Definitive History, p. 259; Begg, The Facts, p. 323; Leighton, pp. 41‚Äì47; Rumbelow, pp. 154‚Äì155 Druitt's father died suddenly from a heart attack in September 1885, leaving an estate valued at ¬£16,579 (equivalent to ¬£ today).Cullen, p. 227; Leighton, pp. 43‚Äì44; McDonald, p. 90 In a codicil, Druitt senior instructed his executors to deduct the money he had advanced to his son from the legacy of ¬£500. Montague received very little money, if any, from his father's will, although he did receive some of his father's personal possessions.Leighton, p. 44 Most of Dr Druitt's estate went to his wife Ann, three unmarried daughters (Georgiana, Edith and Ethel), and eldest son William.Cullen, p. 227; Leighton, pp. 44‚Äì45; McDonald, p. 90 Druitt rented legal chambers at 9 King's Bench Walk in the Inner Temple.Begg, The Facts, p. 323; Cullen, p. 227; Leighton, p. 41 In the late Victorian era only the wealthy could afford legal action, and only one in eight qualified barristers was able to make a living from the law.George R. Sims quoted in Cullen, p. 228 and McDonald, p. 90; Leighton, p. 46 While some of Druitt's biographers claim his practice did not flourish,Cullen, p. 228; Knight, pp. 107, 129 others suppose that it provided him with a relatively substantial income on the basis of his costly lease of chambers and the value of his estate at death.Begg, The Facts, p. 323; Leighton, p. 47; McDonald, p. 91Spallek, Andrew J.

The team included first-class cricketers A. J. Webbe, J. G. Crowdy, John Frederick and Charles Seymour.Leighton, pp. 55, 177 While working at Blackheath, Druitt joined the local cricket club, Blackheath Morden, and became the club's treasurer.Montague Druitt, CricInfo, ESPN EMEA Ltd, retrieved 26 November 2011Begg, The Definitive History, p. 259; Leighton, p. 37 It was a well-connected club: the President was politician Sir Charles Mills and one of its players was Stanley Christopherson, who later became President of the Marylebone Cricket Club.Leighton, p. 37 After the merger of the club with other local sports associations to form the Blackheath Cricket, Football and Lawn Tennis Company, Druitt took on the additional roles of company secretary and director.Begg, The Facts, p. 323; Leighton, p. 42; McDonald, p. 91 The inaugural game of the new club was played against George Gibbons Hearne's Eleven, which included many members of the famous cricketing Hearne family. Hearne's team won by 21 runs.Leighton, pp. 45, 181 On 5 June 1886, in a match between Blackheath and a gentleman's touring team called the Band of Brothers, led by Lord Harris, Druitt bowled Harris for 14 and took three other wickets. Blackheath won by 178 runs.Leighton, pp. 45, 182 Two weeks later, he dismissed England batsman John Shuter, who was playing for Bexley Cricket Club, for a duck, and Blackheath won the game by 114 runs.Leighton, pp. 45, 184 The following year, Shuter returned to Blackheath with a Surrey County side that included Walter Read, William Lockwood, and Bobby Abel, whom Druitt bowled out for 56. Surrey won by 147 runs.Leighton, pp. 48, 186 On 26 May 1884, Druitt was elected to the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) on the recommendation of his fellow Butterflies player Charles Seymour, who proposed him, and noted fielder Vernon Royle, who seconded his nomination.Leighton, p. 38 One of the minor matches he played for MCC was with England bowler William Attewell against Harrow School on 10 June 1886. The MCC won by 57 runs.Leighton, pp. 61, 183 Druitt also played against MCC for Blackheath: on 23 July 1887, he bowled out Dick Pougher for 28 runs, but he only made 5 runs before bowled out by Arnold Fothergill with a ball caught by Pougher. The MCC won by 52 runs.Leighton, pp. 62, 189 In June 1888, Lord Harris played twice for Blackheath with Druitt and Stanley Christopherson; Blackheath won both matches easily, but Druitt was out of form and contributed neither runs nor wickets in either match.Leighton, pp. 84, 191‚Äì192 In August 1888, Druitt played for the Gentlemen of Bournemouth against the Parsees cricket team during their tour of England, and took five wickets in the visitors' first innings. Nevertheless, the Parsees won.Gentlemen of Bournemouth v Parsees 3‚Äì4 August 1888, CricInfo, ESPN EMEA Ltd, retrieved 26 November 2011 On 8 September 1888, the Blackheath Club played against the Christopherson brothers. Druitt was bowled out by Stanley Christopherson, who was playing with his brothers instead of for Blackheath, and in reply Druitt bowled out Christopherson. Blackheath won by 22 runs.Blackheath Club v Brothers Christopherson 8 September 1888, CricInfo, ESPN EMEA Ltd, retrieved 26 November 2011Leighton, p. 193 In addition to cricket, Druitt also played field hockey.Bristol Mercury and Daily Post, 9 March 1886 Death On Friday 30 November 1888, Druitt was dismissed from his post at the Blackheath boys' school. The reason for his dismissal is unclear.Begg, The Facts, p. 325; Fido, p. 203; Leighton, p. 90; McDonald, p. 92; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 106 One newspaper, quoting his brother William's inquest testimony, reported that he was dismissed because he \\"had got into serious trouble\\", but did not specify any further.Acton, Chiswick and Turnham Green Gazette, 5 January 1889, quoted in Begg, The Definitive History, p. 261; McDonald, p. 142 and Evans and Skinner, p. 588 In early December 1888, he disappeared, and on 21 December 1888 the Blackheath Cricket Club's minute book records that he was removed as treasurer and secretary in the belief that he had \\"gone abroad\\".Quoted in Begg, The Definitive History, p. 260; Leighton, p. 91 and McDonald, p. 147 On 31 December 1888, his body was found floating in the River Thames, off Thornycroft's torpedo works, Chiswick, by a waterman named Henry Winslade.Acton, Chiswick and Turnham Green Gazette, 5 January 1889, quoted in Begg, The Definitive History, p. 261; Evans and Skinner, p. 588; Leighton, pp. 93‚Äì94; and McDonald, p. 141; Thames Valley Times, 2 January 1889, quoted in Evans and Skinner, p. 589The County of Middlesex Independent, Wednesday 2 January 1889, p. 3, quoted in Cullen, p. 222 and Leighton, p. 93, said the waterman's name was Winslow. Stones in Druitt's pockets had kept his body submerged for about a month.Whitehead and Rivett, p. 106 He was in possession of a return train ticket to Hammersmith dated 1 December, a silver watch, a cheque for ¬£50 and ¬£16 in gold (equivalent to ¬£ and ¬£ today).Southern Guardian, 5 January 1889, quoted in Cullen, p. 223; Dorset County Chronicle and Somersetshire Gazette, 10 January 1889, quoted in Evans and Skinner, p. 590The Acton, Chiswick and Turnham Green Gazette, 5 January 1889, quoted in Begg, The Definitive History, p. 261; Leighton, p. 94; McDonald, p. 141; and Evans and Skinner, p. 588, says there were two cheques for ¬£50 and ¬£16 respectively and ¬£2 17s 2d in cash. It is not known why he should have carried such a large amount of money,Cullen, p. 231; Rumbelow, p. 156 but it could have been a final payment from the school.Leighton, p. 96; Rumbelow, p. 156 Some modern authors suggest that Druitt was dismissed because he was a homosexual or pederast and that may have driven him to suicide.Eddleston, p. 209; Marriott, pp. 233‚Äì234; McDonald, pp. 142‚Äì144 One speculation is that the money found on his body was going to be used for payment to a blackmailer.Rumbelow, p. 156 Others, however, think that there is no evidence of homosexuality and that his suicide was instead precipitated by a hereditary psychiatric illness.Begg, The Facts, pp. 324‚Äì328; Cornwell, pp. 184‚Äì185; Rumbelow, p. 155 His mother suffered from depression and was institutionalised from July 1888.Begg, The Definitive History, p. 260; Begg, The Facts, p. 324; Leighton, pp. 47, 84; McDonald, p. 91 She died in an asylum in Chiswick in 1890.Begg, The Definitive History, p. 260; Begg, The Facts, p. 324; Cullen, p. 230; Leighton, p. 87; McDonald, pp. 91, 142; Rumbelow, p. 156 His maternal grandmother committed suicide while insane, his aunt attempted suicide, and his eldest sister committed suicide in old age.McDonald, p. 144 A note written by Druitt and addressed to his brother William, who was a solicitor in Bournemouth, was found in Druitt's room in Blackheath. It read, \\"Since Friday I felt that I was going to be like mother, and the best thing for me was to die.\\"Inquest testimony of William H. Druitt reported \\"to this effect\\", indicating that it is not an exact quotation of the letter, in Acton, Chiswick and Turnham Green Gazette, 5 January 1889, quoted in Begg, The Definitive History, p. 259; Evans and Skinner, p. 588; Leighton, p. 94; and McDonald, p. 141 As was usual in the district, the inquest was held at the Lamb Tap public house, Chiswick, by the coroner Dr Thomas Bramah Diplock, on 2 January 1889.Begg, The Definitive History, p. 259; County of Middlesex Independent, Saturday 5 January 1889, quoted in Cullen, p. 223 The coroner's jury concluded that Druitt had committed suicide by drowning while in an unsound state of mind.Cornwell, p. 185; Cullen, p. 234; Leighton, p. 94; Acton, Chiswick and Turnham Green Gazette, 5 January 1889, quoted in Evans and Skinner, p. 588 and McDonald, p. 141 He was buried in Wimborne cemetery the next day.Though suicides were not usually buried in consecrated ground, exceptions were made for people found insane (Leighton, p. 100). At probate, his estate was valued at ¬£2,600 (equivalent to ¬£ today).Begg, The Facts, p. 324; McDonald, pp. 143‚Äì144 It is not known why Druitt committed suicide in Chiswick. One suggested link is that one of his University friends, Thomas Seymour Tuke of the Tuke family, lived there. Tuke was a psychiatric doctor with whom Druitt played cricket, and Druitt's mother was committed to Tuke's asylum in 1890.McDonald, pp. 91, 142‚Äì143 Another suggestion is that Druitt knew Harry Wilson, whose house, \\"The Osiers\\", lay between Hammersmith station and Thornycroft's wharf, where Druitt's body was found.Leighton, pp. 70‚Äì74; McDonald, p. 143 Jack the Ripper suspect George R. Sims appears to identify Druitt with the Ripper, albeit obliquely, in his autobiography. On 31 August 1888, Mary Ann Nichols was found murdered in the impoverished Whitechapel district in the East End of London, with her throat slashed. During September, three more women (Annie Chapman on the 8th, and Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes on the 30th) were found dead with their throats cut. On 9 November 1888, the body of Mary Jane Kelly was discovered. Her throat had been severed down to the spine. In four of the cases the bodies were mutilated after death. The similarities between the crimes led to the supposition that they were committed by the same assailant, who was given the nickname \\"Jack the Ripper\\". Despite an extensive police investigation into the five murders, the Ripper was never identified and the crimes remain unsolved. Shortly after Kelly's murder, stories that the Ripper had drowned in the Thames began to circulate. In February 1891, the MP for West Dorset, Henry Richard Farquharson, announced that Jack the Ripper was \\"the son of a surgeon\\" who had committed suicide on the night of the last murder. Although Farquharson did not name his suspect, the description resembles Druitt. Farquharson lived from the Druitt family and was part of the same social class.Spallek, Andrew (February 2008) \\"The 'West of England MP' Identified\\", Ripperologist 88: 31‚Äì34 The Victorian journalist George R. Sims noted in his memoirs, The Mysteries of Modern London (1906): \\"[the Ripper's] body was found in the Thames after it had been in the river for about a month\\".Cullen, p. 220 Similar comments were made by Sir John Moylan, Assistant Under-Secretary of the Home Office: \\"[the Ripper] escaped justice by committing suicide at the end of 1888\\" and Sir Basil Thomson, made Assistant Commissioner of the CID in 1913: \\"[the Ripper was] an insane Russian doctor [who] escaped arrest by committing suicide in the Thames at the end of 1888\\".Quoted in Cullen, p. 215 and Knight, p. 122 Neither Moylan nor Thomson was involved in the Ripper investigation.Cullen, p. 215 A page from Melville Macnaghten's 1894 memorandum in which Druitt and two other suspects in the Jack the Ripper murders are named Assistant Chief Constable Sir Melville Macnaghten named Druitt as a suspect in the case in a private handwritten memorandum of 23 February 1894. Macnaghten highlighted the coincidence between Druitt's disappearance and death shortly after the last of the five murders on 9 November 1888, and claimed to have unspecified \\"private information\\" that left \\"little doubt\\" Druitt's own family believed him to have been the murderer.Macnaghten's memo, quoted in Cullen, p. 219; Knight, p. 124; Leighton, p. 133; Marriott, pp. 231‚Äì234; McDonald, p. 139; Rumbelow, p. 157; and Whitehead and Rivett, p. 106 Macnaghten's memo was eventually discovered in his personal papers by his daughter, Lady Aberconway, who showed them to British broadcaster Dan Farson. A slightly different abridged copy of the memo found in the Metropolitan Police archive was released to the public in 1966.McDonald, p. 139 Farson first revealed Druitt's initials \\"MJD\\" in a television programme in November 1959.Woods and Baddeley, p. 125 In 1961, Farson investigated a claim by an Australian that Montague's cousin, Lionel Druitt, had published a pamphlet in Australia entitled \\"The East End Murderer ‚Äî I knew him\\", but the claim has never been substantiated.Eddleston, p. 210; Fido, p. 205; Knight, pp. 129‚Äì134; Leighton, pp. 114‚Äì115; McDonald, p. 140; Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 106‚Äì107 Journalist Tom Cullen revealed Druitt's full name in his 1965 book Autumn of Terror, which was followed by Farson's 1972 book Jack the Ripper.Woods and Baddeley, p. 126 Before the discovery of Macnaghten's memo, books on the Ripper case, such as those written by Leonard Matters and Donald McCormick, poured scorn on stories that the Ripper had drowned in the Thames because they could not find a suicide that matched the description of the culprit.Cullen, p. 222 Cullen and Farson, however, supposed that Druitt was the Ripper on the basis of the Macnaghten memorandum,Cullen, p. 232 the near coincidence between Druitt's death and the end of the murders, the closeness of Whitechapel to Druitt's rooms in the Inner Temple,Cullen, p. 237 the insanity that was acknowledged by the inquest verdict of \\"unsound mind\\",Cullen, pp. 234‚Äì235 and the possibility that Druitt had absorbed the rudimentary anatomical skill supposedly shown by the Ripper through observing his father at work.Cullen, p. 238 Since the publication of Cullen's and Farson's books, other Ripper authors have argued that their theories are based solely on flawed circumstantial evidence, and have attempted to provide Druitt with alibis for the times of the murders.Knight, pp. 121‚Äì138; Leighton, pp. 134, 138, 155; Marriott, p. 232; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 106 On 1 September, the day after the murder of Nichols, Druitt was in Dorset playing cricket.Begg, The Facts, p. 325; Leighton, p. 87; Marriott, p. 223 On the day of Chapman's murder, he played cricket in Blackheath, and the day after the murders of Stride and Eddowes, he was in the West Country defending a client in a court case.Leighton, p. 89 While writers Andrew Spallek and Tom Cullen argue that Druitt had the time and opportunity to travel by train between London and his cricket and legal engagements, or use his city chambers as a base from which to commit the murders,Cullen, pp. 236‚Äì237 others dismiss that as \\"improbable\\".Leighton, pp. 87‚Äì88 Many experts believe that the killer was local to Whitechapel,e.g. Canter, David (2003) Mapping Murder: The Secrets of Geographical Profiling, London: Virgin Books, , p. 92; Rossmo, D. K., \\"Jack the Ripper\\", Center for Geospatial Intelligence and Investigation, Texas State University; Rossmo cited in Leighton, p. 162 whereas Druitt lived miles away on the other side of the River Thames.Marriott, p. 233 His chambers were within walking distance of Whitechapel, and his regular rail journey would almost certainly have brought him to Cannon Street station, a few minutes' walk from the East End.Spallek, Andrew J. (2008) \\"Rail Service between Blackheath and London in 1888: Does it Place Druitt Near the East End?\\", Ripper Notes 28: 54‚Äì59 It seems unlikely, however, that he could have travelled the distance in blood-stained clothes unnoticed,Leighton, p. 88 and a clue discovered during the investigation into the murder of Catherine Eddowes (a piece of her blood-stained clothing) indicates that the murderer travelled north-east from where she was murdered, whereas Druitt's chambers, and the railway station, were to the south- west.Fido, p. 204 Macnaghten incorrectly described Druitt as a 41-year-old doctor,Cullen, p. 221; Eddleston, p. 210; Leighton, p. 134; Marriott, p. 233; McDonald, p. 140; Rumbelow, p. 157 and cited allegations that he \\"was sexually insane\\" without specifying the source or details of the allegations.Cornwell, p. 184; Cullen, p. 219; Marriott, p. 232 Macnaghten did not join the force until 1889, after the murder of Kelly and the death of Druitt, and was not involved in the investigation directly.Cornwell, p. 182; Leighton, p. 131; Marriott, p. 231 Macnaghten's memorandum named two other suspects (\\"Kosminski\\" and Michael Ostrog) and was written to refute allegations against a fourth, Thomas Cutbush.Macnaghten's notes quoted by Cullen, pp. 218‚Äì219; Evans and Skinner, pp. 584‚Äì587; Leighton, pp. 133, 138; McDonald, p. 139; Rumbelow, p. 142; and Whitehead and Rivett, p. 105 The three Macnaghten suspects ‚Äî Druitt, Kosminski and Ostrog ‚Äî also match the descriptions of three unnamed suspects in Major Arthur Griffiths' Mysteries of Police and Crime (1898); Griffiths was Inspector of Prisons at the time of the Ripper murders.Evans and Skinner, pp. 623‚Äì624 Inspector Frederick Abberline, who was the leading investigative officer in the case, appeared to dismiss Druitt as a suspect on the basis that the only evidence against him was the coincidental timing of his suicide shortly after the fifth murder.Leighton, p. 152; Interview in the Pall Mall Gazette, 31 March 1903, quoted in Begg, The Definitive History, p. 264 Other officials involved in the Ripper case, Metropolitan Police Commissioner James Monro and pathologist Thomas Bond, believed that the murder of Alice McKenzie on 17 July 1889, seven months after Druitt's death, was committed by the same culprit as the earlier murders.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 207‚Äì209; Leighton, p. 125 The inclusion of McKenzie among the Ripper's victims was contested by Abberline and Macnaghten among others,For Abberline, see: Interview in Cassell's Saturday Journal, 28 May 1892, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 225. For Macnaghten, see: Macnaghten's notes quoted by Cook, p. 151; Evans and Skinner, pp. 584‚Äì587; Leighton, p. 157; and Rumbelow, p. 140. For others (the Head of the London Criminal Investigation Department Sir Robert Anderson and pathologist George Bagster Phillips), see: Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 208‚Äì209; Leighton, pp. 157‚Äì159; and Marriott, pp. 182‚Äì183. but if she was one of his victims, then Druitt clearly could not be the Ripper.Leighton, p. 125 Another murder occasionally included among the Ripper cases is that of Martha Tabram, who was viciously stabbed to death on 7 August 1888. Her death coincided with the middle of Bournemouth Cricket Week, 4‚Äì11 August, in which Druitt was heavily involved, and was during the school holidays which Druitt spent in Dorset.Leighton, pp. 85, 157‚Äì158 In the words of one of his biographers, \\"It scarcely left time for a 200-mile round dash to fit in a murder.\\"Leighton, p. 158 Legacy Druitt was a favoured suspect in the Jack the Ripper crimes throughout the 1960s, until the advent of theories in the 1970s that the murders were not the work of a single serial killer but the result of a conspiracy involving the British royal family and Freemasonry.Knight, p. 45; Woods and Baddeley, p. 246 These theories, widely condemned as ridiculous,e.g. Begg, The Definitive History, pp. x‚Äìxi; Cook, p. 9; Cornwell, pp. 133‚Äì135; Fido, pp. 185‚Äì196, 206; Hyde, p. 58; Marriott, pp. 267‚Äì268; Rumbelow, pp. 209‚Äì244 implicate Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, his tutor James Stephen, and their doctor Sir William Gull to varying degrees. One version of the conspiracy promoted by Stephen Knight in his 1976 book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution supposed that Druitt was a scapegoat, chosen by officialdom to take the blame for the murders.Knight, p. 121 Martin Howells and Keith Skinner followed the same line in their 1987 book The Ripper Legacy, which was panned by one critic as being based on \\"no evidence whatever\\".Bennett, Catherine (2 October 1987) \\"Who was Jack the Ripper? And who really cares?\\", The Times Memorial to Montague John Druitt at Wimborne Cemetery, stating the death date as 4 December 1888 The theories attempted to link Druitt with Clarence, Gull and Stephen through a network of mutual acquaintances and possible connections. Reginald Acland, the brother of Gull's son-in-law, had legal chambers in King's Bench Walk near Druitt's,Knight, p. 140; Leighton, p. 70 as did Harry Stephen, who was James Stephen's brother. Harry Stephen was good friends with Harry Wilson, who had a house in Chiswick, \\"The Osiers\\", near to where Druitt's body was found.Leighton, pp. 70‚Äì71, 93; McDonald, p. 143 Wilson and James Stephen were close friends of Clarence, and were both members of an exclusive society called the Cambridge Apostles.Leighton, pp. 70‚Äì71 As a schoolboy, Druitt had played cricket against two of Wilson's friends, Kynaston Studd and Henry Goodhart, who was also one of the Apostles.Leighton, p. 74 Another potential connection between Druitt and Wilson is through John Henry Lonsdale. Lonsdale's name and Blackheath address are written in a diary belonging to Wilson now in the possession of Trinity College, Cambridge. Lonsdale's address is a few yards from the school at which Druitt worked and lived, and Lonsdale had been a barrister and had also rented legal chambers in King's Bench Walk. In 1887, Lonsdale entered the church and was assigned as curate to Wimborne Minster, where the Druitt family worshiped. Lonsdale and Macnaghten were classmates at Eton, and so theorists argue that Lonsdale might have been in a position to provide \\"private information\\" to Macnaghten regarding Druitt.Spallek, Andrew (November 2007) \\"John Henry Lonsdale: A Possible Source of Macnaghten's 'Private Information'\\", Ripperologist 85: 3‚Äì10 The connections between the Apostles and Druitt led to the suggestion that he was part of the same social set.Leighton, pp. 69‚Äì80 Druitt, his mother, and his sister Georgiana, were invited to a ball in honour of Clarence at the home of Lord Wimborne on 17 December 1888, although they did not attend because by that time Montague was dead, his mother was in an asylum, and his sister was expecting her second child.Leighton, p. 76 Clarence, Stephen, Wilson, Studd, and Goodhart are suggested to have been homosexual,Leighton, p. 71 although this is contested by historians.Bradford, Sarah (1989) King George VI, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, , p. 10; Hyde, p. 56 John Wilding's 1993 book Jack the Ripper Revealed used the connections between Druitt and Stephen to propose that they committed the crimes together, but reviewers considered it an \\"imaginative tale ... most questionable\\",Leighton, p. 157 an \\"exercise in ingenuity rather than ... fact\\",Whittington-Egan, Richard (April 1994), \\"Book reviews\\", Contemporary Review, and \\"lack[ing] evidential support\\".Begg, The Facts, p. 513 In his 2005 and 2006 biographies of Druitt, D. J. Leighton concluded that Druitt was innocent,Leighton, pp. 160‚Äì162 but repeated some of Knight's and Wilding's discredited claims.e.g. Book review of Leighton, D. J.

Jack the Ripper: Media, Culture, History, Manchester University Press, , p. 16 Because Druitt and the other upper- middle-class and aristocratic Ripper suspects were wealthy, there is more biographical material on them than on the residents of the Whitechapel slums. Consequently, it is easier for writers to construct solutions based on a wealthy culprit rather than one involving a Whitechapel resident. There is no direct evidence against Druitt,Cornwell, pp. 16, 184; Knight, p. 135; Leighton, p. 149; Marriott, pp. 232‚Äì234; Rumbelow, pp. 156, 163; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 106 and since the 1970s, the number of Jack the Ripper suspects has continued to grow, with the result that there are now over 100 different theories about the Ripper's identity.Whiteway, Ken (2004). \\"A Guide to the Literature of Jack the Ripper\\". Canadian Law Library Review, vol. 29, pp. 219‚Äì229Eddleston, pp. 195‚Äì244; Leighton, p. 157 In fiction, Druitt is depicted as the murderer in the musical Jack the Ripper by Ron Pember and Denis de Marne. In John Gardner's Sherlock Holmes story The Return of Moriarty, Professor Moriarty's criminal exploits are hampered by increased police activity as a result of the Jack the Ripper murders. He discovers that Druitt is the murderer and so fakes his suicide in the hope that the police will lose interest once the murders cease.Rumbelow, pp. 291‚Äì292 In Alan Moore's graphic novel From Hell, Druitt is portrayed as a patsy for the royal family, made to look guilty of the Ripper murders in order to protect the real killer, Sir William Gull.

Located at the corner of Gaffey and 37th Streets, the section of the park is alternatively called the \\"Korean-American Peace Park\\" and occupies part of the former Upper Reservation of Fort MacArthur. It is modeled after the Divine Bell of King Seongdeok the Great of Silla (also known as the Emille Bell), cast in 771 for Bongdeok Temple and now located at the National Museum of Gyeongju. The Emille Bell is the largest bell ever cast in Korean history; both are among the largest bells in the world. The bell is made of over seventeen tons of copper and tin, with gold, nickel, lead, and phosphorus added to the alloy for tone quality. It has a diameter of 7¬Ω feet, average thickness of 8 inches, and a height of 12 feet. The exterior surface is richly decorated in relief, featuring four pairs of figures. Each pair includes a \\"Goddess of Liberty\\" (bearing some resemblance to the Statue of Liberty) and a Seonnyeo, or Korean spirit figure, holding the South Korean national symbol: a Taegeuk symbol, a branch of rose of Sharon, a branch of laurel, and a dove. The \\"Belfry of Friendship\\" (Ujeong-ui Jonggak), which houses the bell History The bell was presented by the South Korean government to the United States to celebrate the bicentennial of the U.S. and to symbolize friendship between the two countries. The effort was coordinated by Philip Ahn, a Korean American actor. It was dedicated on October 3, 1976, and declared Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 187 in 1978. Beginning in 2010, the bell has been ceremonially struck five times a year: on New Year's Eve, Korean American Day (January 13), the Fourth of July, Korean Liberation Day (August 15), and Constitution Day (September 17). It was also rung on September 11, 2002, to commemorate the first anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The bell is also rung without specific ceremony on the first Saturday of each month at noon, 13 times for the public to enjoy. The bell does not have a clapper; instead, it is sounded by striking it with a large wooden log. The pavilion that houses the bell, known as the Belfry of Friendship, was built by South Korean craftsmen over a period of ten months. Its design is traditional. It is axially symmetric, consisting of a hipped (a.k.a. \\"pyramidal\\") roof supported by twelve columns representing the Korean zodiac, each column guarded by a carved animal. The color patterning along the bell's pavilion is known in Korean as dancheong. In 2013, the bell received a full restoration to remove accumulated rust and graffiti tagging, and access to the bell and the pavilion was restricted from September through December.

The path of least resistance is the physical or metaphorical pathway that provides the least resistance to forward motion by a given object or entity, among a set of alternative paths. The concept is often used to describe why an object or entity takes a given path. The way in which water flows is often given as an example for the idea. Bicycle traffic barrier used to slow down cyclists circumvented by a detour in the form of a desire path, thereby showing a literal path of least resistance. Description In physics, the \\"path of least resistance\\" is a heuristic from folk physics that can sometimes, in very simple situations, describe approximately what happens. It is an approximation of the tendency to the least energy state. Other examples are \\"what goes up must come down\\" (gravity) and \\"heat goes from hot to cold\\" (second law of thermodynamics). But these simple descriptions are not derived from laws of physics and in more complicated cases these heuristics will fail to give even approximately correct results. In electrical circuits, for example, the current always follows all available paths, and in some simple cases the \\"path of least resistance\\" will take up most of the current, but this will not be generally true in even slightly more complicated circuits. It may seem for example, that if there are three paths of approximately equal resistance, the majority of the current will flow down one of the three paths. However, due to electrons repelling each other the total path of least resistance is in fact to have approximate equal current flowing through each path. The reason for this is that three paths made of equally conductive wire will have a total resistance that is one-third of the single path. In conclusion, the current is always distributed over all possible paths inversely proportional to their resistance. The path of least resistance is also used to describe certain human behaviors, although with much less specificity than in the strictly physical sense. In these cases, resistance is often used as a metaphor for personal effort or confrontation; a person taking the path of least resistance avoids these. In-library science and technical writing, information is ideally arranged for users according to the principle of least effort, or the \\"path of least resistance\\". Recursive navigation systems are an example of this. The path of least resistance applies on a local, not global, reference. For example, water always flows downhill, regardless of whether briefly flowing uphill will help it gain a lower final altitude (with certain exceptions such as superfluids and siphons). In physics, this phenomenon allows the formation of potential wells, where potential energy is stored because of a barrier restricting flow to a lower energy state.

He was hanged for the murder of his wife Ellen in 1889, and was the last person executed in Dundee, Scotland. Bury was orphaned at an early age and was educated at a charitable school in the English Midlands. After a few years in regular employment, he fell into financial difficulty, was dismissed for theft, and became a street peddler. In 1887 he moved to London, where he married Ellen Elliot, who was probably a prostitute. During their stormy marriage, which lasted just over a year, they faced increasing financial hardship. In January 1889, they moved to Dundee. The following month, Bury strangled his wife with a rope, stabbed her dead body with a penknife, and hid the corpse in a box in their room. A few days later, he presented himself to the local police and was arrested for her murder. Tried and convicted, he was sentenced to death by hanging. Shortly before his execution, he confessed to the crime. Although Bury's guilt was not in doubt, Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty and The Dundee Courier printed an editorial the day after his execution decrying the \\"judicial butcheries\\" of capital punishment. Bury killed his wife shortly after the height of the London Whitechapel murders, which were attributed to the unidentified serial killer \\"Jack the Ripper\\". Bury's previous abode near Whitechapel and similarities between the Ripper's crimes and Bury's led the press, as well as executioner James Berry, to suggest that Bury was the Ripper. Bury protested his innocence in the Ripper crimes, and the police discounted him as a suspect. Later authors have built on the earlier accusations, but the idea that Bury was the Ripper is not widely accepted. Childhood and youth William Bury was born in Stourbridge, Worcestershire, the youngest of four children of Henry Bury and his wife Mary Jane (n√©e Henley). He was orphaned in infancy. His father, who worked for a local fishmonger called Joscelyne, died in a horse and cart accident in Halesowen on 10 April 1860. While on an incline, he fell beneath the wheels of his fish cart and was killed when the horse bolted and pulled the cart over his prone body.Beadle, pp. 36‚Äì37 William's mother may have been suffering from post- natal depression at the time of her husband's death and was committed to the Worcester County Pauper and Lunatic Asylum on 7 May 1860 suffering from melancholia.Beadle, pp. 36‚Äì38 She remained there until her death aged 33 on 30 March 1864.Beadle, p. 38; Macpherson, p. 40 William's eldest sibling, Elizabeth Ann, died at the age of seven during an epileptic fit on 7 September 1859, which may have contributed to Mary Jane's depression.Beadle, p. 36 The other two children, Joseph Henry and Mary Jane, both died before 1889.Bury's reprieve petition, 1 April 1889, quoted in Beadle, p. 38 William was raised initially in Dudley by his maternal uncle, Edward Henley,Beadle, p. 38 and by 1871 he was enrolled at the Blue Coat charity school in Stourbridge.Beadle, p. 39 At the age of sixteen, he found work as a factor's clerk in a warehouse at Horseley Fields, Wolverhampton, until the early 1880s when he left the warehouse after failing to repay a loan.Beadle, p. 52 He then worked for a lock manufacturer called Osborne in Lord Street, Wolverhampton, until he was dismissed for theft in either 1884 or 1885.Beadle, pp. 52‚Äì53 For the next few years, his whereabouts are not known for certain, but he appears to have lived an unsettled life in the English Midlands and Yorkshire.Beadle, p. 53 In 1887, he was making a living as a hawker, selling small items such as pencils and key rings on the streets of Snow Hill, Birmingham.Beadle, p. 53; Macpherson, p. 41 London In October 1887, Bury arrived in Bow, London, and found work selling sawdust for James Martin, who appears to have run a brothel at 80 Quickett Street, Bow. Initially, Bury lived in the stable, but later moved into the house. There, he met Ellen Elliot, who was employed by Martin as a servant and probably a prostitute.Beadle, pp. 73‚Äì74; Macpherson, pp. 43‚Äì44 Ellen was born on 24 October 1856 in Walworth, London, at the Bricklayer's Arms public house run by her father, George Elliot.Beadle, pp. 70‚Äì72 In adult life, she worked as a needlewoman and in a jute processing factory.Testimony of Ellen's sister, Margaret Corney, quoted in Macpherson, p. 52 In 1883, she had an illegitimate daughter, also called Ellen, who died in Poplar workhouse in December 1885. Within a year of the death of her daughter, she began working for Martin.Beadle, p. 73 In March 1888, Ellen and William left Martin's employ and moved to a furnished room at 3 Swaton Road, Bow, where they lived together until their marriage on Easter Monday, 2 April 1888, at Bromley Parish Church.Beadle, p. 79 Martin later said he had dismissed William because of unpaid debts.Martin's statement, 14 February 1889, and trial evidence, 28 March 1889, quoted in Beadle, p. 76 Martin and the landlady at 3 Swaton Road, Elizabeth Haynes, described Bury as a violent drunk.Beadle, p. 81; Macpherson, pp. 46‚Äì47 On 7 April 1888, Haynes caught Bury kneeling on his bride of five days threatening to cut her throat with a knife. Haynes subsequently evicted them, and Ellen sold one of six ¬£100 shares in a railway company that she had inherited from a maiden aunt, Margaret Barren, to pay William's debt to Martin.Beadle, p. 82 William was re-employed by Martin, and the couple moved to 11 Blackthorn Street, close to Swaton Road. According to Martin, William was then suffering from venereal disease.Martin's statement, 14 February 1889, quoted in Beadle, p. 83; Macpherson, p. 49 In June, Ellen sold the remaining shares,Statement of the Secretary of the London Union Bank to the Procurator Fiscal, 15 February 1889, quoted in Beadle, p. 84 and in August they moved to 3 Spanby Road, adjacent to where William stabled his horse.Landlord William Smith's statement, 14 February 1889, quoted in Beadle, p. 98 With the money from the shares, the couple had a week's holiday in Wolverhampton with a drinking friend of William's and Ellen bought new jewellery.Beadle, pp. 99‚Äì102 William continued to assault his wife throughout the latter half of 1888.Statements of landlord William Smith, 14 February 1889, and Ellen's sister, Margaret Corney, 15 February 1889, quoted in Beadle, pp. 174‚Äì175; Macpherson, pp. 56‚Äì57 By the first week of December, Ellen's windfall was nearly spent, and William sold his horse and cart.Testimony, 28 March 1889, and statement, 15 February 1889, of Ellen's sister, Margaret Corney, quoted in Beadle, p. 208 In January the following year, he told his landlord at 3 Spanby Road that he was thinking of emigrating to Brisbane, Australia, and asked him to make two wooden crates for the journey.Beadle, p. 223 Instead, William and Ellen moved to Dundee in Scotland. Ellen was not keen to go and only did so after William lied that he had obtained a position in a jute factory there.Beadle, pp. 221‚Äì223; Macpherson, pp. 60‚Äì62 Dundee Dundee, c. 1876 The Burys travelled north as second-class passengers on the steamer Cambria. They arrived at Dundee on the evening of 20 January 1889, and the following morning they rented a room above a bar at 43 Union Street.Beadle, p. 227; Macpherson, pp. 63‚Äì64 The Burys stayed for only eight days before they moved on 29 January to a squat at 113 Prince's Street, a basement flat under a shop. William had obtained the key under false pretences by telling the letting agents that he was a viewer interested in renting the property.Beadle, pp. 230‚Äì231; Macpherson, p. 70 Meanwhile, Ellen found a job as a cleaner at a local mill, but she quit after a day.Dundee Courier, 12 February 1889, quoted in Beadle, p. 234; Macpherson, p. 76 William continued to drink heavily, often with a decorator called David Walker, who was re- painting the public house frequented by William.Beadle, p. 234; Macpherson, p. 80 On Monday 4 February, William bought some rope at the local grocer's shop, and spent the rest of the day observing cases at the Sheriff Court from the public gallery. He was later reported to have listened attentively to the proceedings.People's Journal, 16 February 1889, quoted in Beadle, p. 235 On 7 February, he attended the court sessions again. On 10 February, he visited his acquaintance, Walker, who lent him a newspaper that featured a woman's suicide by hanging.Walker's statement, 18 February 1889, quoted in Beadle, p. 238 Walker asked Bury to look up any news of Jack the Ripper, at which Bury threw down the newspaper with a fright.Macpherson, p. 83 That evening, he walked into the Dundee Central Police Station on Bell Street and reported his wife's suicide to Lieutenant James Parr. He said they had been drinking heavily the night before her death, and he had woken in the morning to find his wife's body on the floor with a rope around her neck.Beadle, p. 241 Bury had not summoned a doctor, but had instead cut the body and concealed it in one of the packing cases brought from London. Bury told Parr that his actions were now preying on his mind, and he was afraid that he would be arrested and accused of being Jack the Ripper.Parr's statement, 13 February 1889, quoted in Beadle, pp. 241‚Äì242; Macpherson, pp. 19‚Äì20 Parr took Bury upstairs to see Lieutenant David Lamb, the head of the detective department. Parr told Lamb, \\"This man has a wonderful story to tell you.\\"Parr's statement, 13 February 1889, quoted in Beadle, p. 242 Bury retold his story to Lamb, but omitted the reference to Jack the Ripper, and added that he had stabbed his wife's body once.Lamb's statement, 18 February 1889, quoted in Beadle, p. 242; Macpherson, p. 20 Bury was searched, and a small knife, bankbook and his house key were confiscated pending inquiries.Beadle, p. 242 Lamb and Detective Constable Peter Campbell proceeded to the Burys' dingy flat, where they discovered the mutilated remains of Ellen stuffed into the wooden box Bury had commissioned in London.Lamb's trial evidence, 28 March 1889, quoted in Beadle, p. 246 Investigation Inspector Abberline of Scotland Yard interviewed Bury's former employer and landlords. Lamb returned to the police station and charged William with Ellen's murder. Ellen's jewellery, found in William's pockets, was confiscated.Beadle, p. 247; Macpherson, p. 25 A preliminary search of the premises revealed chalk graffiti on the rear door of the flat, which read \\"Jack Ripper is at the back of this door\\", and on the stairwell leading up from the rear of the property, which read \\"Jack Ripper is in this seller \\".Beadle, p. 248 The press and the police thought they had been written by a local boy before the tragedy, but the writer was never identified.Beadle, p. 277; Macpherson, pp. 31‚Äì32 A more extensive search the following morning found blood-stained clothing in the crate that had contained the body, and the remains of more clothing and some of Ellen's personal effects burned in the fireplace.Beadle, pp. 250‚Äì251; Macpherson, p. 26 The flat was bereft of furniture, indicating that it may have been burnt on the fire, either for heat or to destroy evidence.Macpherson, pp. 26‚Äì27 A large penknife was found with human flesh and blood upon it, and the rope that William had bought on the morning of 4 February was found with strands of Ellen's hair caught in the fibres.Beadle, p. 246 Ellen's body was examined by five physicians: police surgeon Charles Templeman, his colleague Alexander Stalker, Edinburgh surgeon Henry Littlejohn and two local doctors, David Lennox and William Kinnear. They concluded that Ellen had been strangled from behind.Beadle, p. 255; Macpherson, p. 27 Her right leg was broken in two places so it could be crammed into the crate.Macpherson, p. 24 Incisions, made by the penknife, ran downwards along her abdomen and had been made \\"within at most ten minutes of the time of death\\" according to Templeman, Stalker and Littlejohn.Dr Templeman's statement, 14 February 1889, quoted in Beadle, p. 263; Macpherson, p. 28 Lennox disagreed and thought the wounds were made later on the basis that when he examined the body the wound was not everted, but Templeman and Stalker said the wound was everted when they examined the body. Littlejohn explained that as Lennox made his examination three days after the others, the shape of the wounds could have changed, to which Lennox agreed.Courtroom testimony, 28 March 1889, quoted by Macpherson, p. 94 Chief Constable Dewar sent a telegraph detailing the circumstances of the crime to the London Metropolitan Police, which was investigating the crimes attributed to Jack the Ripper.Beadle, p. 282 Detectives from London did not consider Bury a realistic suspect in their investigation into the Ripper murders,Beadle, pp. 283‚Äì285; Dundee Courier, 15 February 1889, quoted in Macpherson, pp. 34‚Äì35 but Inspector Frederick Abberline did interview witnesses in Whitechapel connected to Bury, including William's former employer James Martin and landlords Elizabeth Haynes and William Smith.Beadle, pp. 283‚Äì284 According to the executioner James Berry and crime reporter Norman Hastings, Scotland Yard sent two detectives to interview Bury, but there is no surviving record of the visit in the police archive.Beadle, pp. 301‚Äì304 Trial and execution On 18 March 1889, Bury was arraigned for the murder of his wife; he entered a plea of not guilty.Beadle, p. 285 The trial was seen before Lord Young in the High Court of Justiciary on 28 March. Bury's defence team comprised solicitor David Tweedie and advocate William Hay; the prosecution was led by advocate depute Dugald or Dill McKechnie.Beadle, p. 286; Macpherson, p. 88 The hearing lasted 13 hours. The prosecution witnesses included Ellen's sister Margaret Corney, William's former employer James Martin, the Burys' London landlady Elizabeth Haynes, William's drinking partner David Walker, Lieutenant Lamb and Drs Templeman and Littlejohn.Beadle, pp. 288‚Äì290 After a break for supper, Hay presented the defence case, which was heavily dependent on Dr Lennox's testimony that Ellen had strangled herself.Beadle, p. 290 At 10:05 p.m., Lord Young finished his summation, and the jury of 15 men retired to consider their verdict. After 25 minutes, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty with a recommendation for mercy.Beadle, p. 291; Macpherson, pp. 97‚Äì98 Lord Young asked the jury why they recommended mercy, and one of them replied that the medical evidence was contradictory, referring to Lennox's testimony. Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty, and the jury may have been trying to avoid passing a death sentence.Beadle, p. 291 Young told the jury to retire and reconsider their verdict until they were decided by the evidence one way or another. At 10:40 p.m., they returned with a unanimous verdict of guilty. Lord Young passed the mandatory sentence for murder: death by hanging. On 1 April, Bury's solicitor, David Tweedie, petitioned the Secretary of State for Scotland, Lord Lothian, for clemency. Tweedie argued that the sentence should be commuted to life imprisonment on the grounds of the conflicting medical evidence and the jury's initial reservations.Quoted in Beadle, p. 292; Macpherson, pp. 100‚Äì101 Tweedie further argued that Bury could have inherited insanity from his mother, who had died in a lunatic asylum.Quoted in Beadle, p. 294; Macpherson, p. 101 A clergyman whom Bury had befriended, Edward John Gough, minister of St Paul's Episcopalian Church in Dundee, also wrote to Lothian asking for a reprieve.Beadle, p. 295 The Secretary of State refused to intervene in the normal course of the law,Beadle, p. 296; Macpherson, pp. 101‚Äì102 and Bury was hanged on 24 April by executioner James Berry. The following day, The Dundee Courier printed an editorial lambasting capital punishment: It was the last execution held in Dundee. A few days before the execution, Bury confessed to Reverend Gough that he had killed Ellen. At the urging of Gough, William wrote a confession on 22 April 1889, which he asked to be withheld until after he was dead.Beadle, p. 297; Evans and Skinner, p. 208; Macpherson, pp. 102‚Äì103 William claimed that he had strangled Ellen without premeditation on the night of 4 February 1889 during a drunken row over money, and that he had tried to dismember the body for disposal the next day but was too squeamish to continue. The latter part of this confession does not match the expert testimony of the physicians, who said that the incisions were made \\"within at most ten minutes of the time of death\\" rather than the next day.Beadle, pp. 267‚Äì268; Macpherson, p. 28 William stated he had stuffed Ellen's body into the crate as part of a later plan for disposal, but instead concocted the suicide story when he realised that Ellen's absence would be noted.Beadle, pp. 267‚Äì268 Jack the Ripper suspect Traditionally, five murders (known as the \\"canonical five\\") are attributed to the notorious serial killer \\"Jack the Ripper\\", who terrorised Whitechapel in the East End of London between August and November 1888. Authorities are not agreed on the exact number of the Ripper's victims, and at least eleven Whitechapel murders between April 1888 and February 1891 were included in the same extensive police investigation. All the crimes remain unsolved. Claims that Bury could have been the Ripper began to appear in newspapers shortly after Bury's arrest. Like Bury, the Ripper had inflicted abdominal wounds on his victims immediately after their deaths,Evans and Skinner, p. 207 and Bury lived in Bow, near Whitechapel, from October 1887 to January 1889, which placed him fairly near the Whitechapel murders at the appropriate time.Woods and Baddeley, p. 253 The Dundee Advertiser of 12 February claimed that the Burys' \\"neighbours were startled and alarmed at the idea that one whom in their terror they associated with the Whitechapel tragedies had been living in their midst.\\"Quoted in Beadle, p. 277 and Macpherson, p. 31 The New York Times of the same day connected Bury directly to the atrocities and reported the theory that William had murdered Ellen to prevent her from revealing his guilt,Quoted in Beadle, p. 278 a story picked up and repeated by The Dundee Courier the following day.Quoted in Macpherson, p. 33 The Courier alleged that Bury admitted to Lieutenant Parr that he was Jack the Ripper,Quoted in Macpherson, p. 21 but Parr's version of the story says only that Bury said he was afraid he would be arrested as Jack the Ripper.Beadle, p. 241; Macpherson, p. 21 Bury denied any connection, despite making a full confession to his wife's murder. Nevertheless, the executioner James Berry promoted the idea that Bury was the Ripper.Evans and Skinner, p. 208 Berry did not include Bury or the Ripper in his memoirs, My Experiences as an Executioner,Macpherson, p. 186 but Ernest A. Parr, a journalist in the Suffolk town of Newmarket, wrote to the Secretary of State for Scotland on 28 March 1908 that Berry \\"told me explicitly that Bury was known to have been Jack the Ripper\\".Quoted by Evans and Skinner, p. 208 and Macpherson, pp. 186‚Äì187 In the 1920s, Norman Hastings built on Berry's hypothesis proposing Bury as the Ripper,The Weekly News, 26 October 1929, quoted in Beadle, pp. 281‚Äì311 and 100 years after the Ripper murders William Beadle and Dundee librarian Euan Macpherson published books and articles popularising Bury as a Ripper suspect.e.g. Beadle, William (1995), Jack the Ripper: Anatomy of a Myth, quoted in Woods and Baddeley, p. 253; Macpherson, Euan (January 1988) \\"Jack the Ripper in Dundee\\", Scots Magazine, quoted in Richard Whittington-Egan's \\"Foreword\\" in Macpherson, p. 11 They highlighted that the canonical five Whitechapel murders ended in November 1888, which roughly coincided with Bury's departure from Whitechapel.Macpherson, p. 15; see also Dundee Advertiser, 25 April 1889, quoted in Macpherson, p. 33 There was graffiti at Bury's Dundee flat that implied that Jack the Ripper lived there,Beadle, p. 248; Woods and Baddeley, p. 253 and Macpherson supposed this was written by Bury as a form of confession.Macpherson, p. 32 William took Ellen's rings, and the Ripper is believed to have taken rings from victim Annie Chapman.Beadle, p. 264 Bury was persistently violent to his wife, threatened her with a knife, and cut open her abdomen after death in a manner not dissimilar to the Whitechapel murderer.Macpherson, pp. 188‚Äì189 In a conversation with her neighbours, Marjory Smith, who ran the shop above the Burys' Prince's Street flat in Dundee, asked them \\"What sort of work was this you Whitechapel folk have been about, letting Jack the Ripper kill so many people?\\" Bury did not answer her, but Ellen replied \\"Jack the Ripper is quiet now.\\" She reportedly told another neighbour, \\"Jack the Ripper is taking a rest.\\"Macpherson, p. 74 Beadle and Macpherson argued that Ellen's comments might indicate that she had knowledge of the Ripper's whereabouts.e.g. Macpherson, p. 75 Others contend that Bury only imitated the Ripper, citing differences between their crimes.Beadle, p. 262 Ellen Bury was strangled with a rope and sustained comparatively few knife wounds compared to the Ripper's victims, whose throats were cut prior to sustaining deep abdominal slashes. Ellen Bury's throat was not cut, and only relatively shallow cuts were made to her abdomen.e.g. Beadle, p. 260; Macpherson, pp. 172‚Äì173 The identity of the Whitechapel murderer is unknown, and over one hundred suspects, in addition to Bury, have been proposed.Whiteway, Ken (2004). \\"A Guide to the Literature of Jack the Ripper\\". Canadian Law Library Review, vol. 29, pp. 219‚Äì229Eddleston, pp. 195‚Äì244 While some Ripper writers consider Bury a more likely culprit than many of the other suspects,e.g. Eddleston, pp. 200‚Äì202 other writers dismiss the theory because, \\"as happens all too frequently in this field, the theorizing appears to have a few disturbing leaps of logic as well as mere anecdotes used as evidence.\\"Vanderlinden and Hacker, p. 90 Notes References =Bibliography= *Beadle, William (2009) Jack the Ripper: Unmasked, London: John Blake, *Eddleston, John J.

He was an eccentric self-promoter and was often in trouble with the law. He has been put forward as a suspect for the notorious and unsolved Jack the Ripper murder spree in Whitechapel, London, in 1888. Early life According to the 1850 United States census, Tumblety was born in Ireland. His parents, James and Margaret Tumuelty (so spelled on their tombstone),Willard, Bev; Thurston, Roy (1998) \\"Francis Tumblety's Grave\\", Casebook: Jack the Ripper, retrieved 3 January 2011 along with his 10 brothers and sisters, immigrated to Rochester, New York, a few years after his birth. By the age of 17 he was selling books, which were possibly pornographic, along the Erie Canal between Rochester and Buffalo. He left home around 17, and did not return for 10 years.Rumbelow, p. 264 He was briefly employed as a cleaner at \\"Lispenard's Hospital\\" in Rochester.\\"\\"Dr.\\" Tumblety\\", Rochester Daily Union & Advertiser, 5 April 1881 Career Tumblety set himself up in business, initially in Detroit.Whitehead and Rivett, p. 126 He claimed to be a \\"great physician\\", but was commonly perceived as a quack.Rumbelow, p. 266; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 126 He sold patent medicines such as \\"Tumblety's Pimple Destroyer\\" and \\"Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills\\", and gained a reputation for his eccentric, ostentatious clothes, which were frequently of a military nature.Rumbelow, p. 265 According to Tumblety, by 1857 he was practicing medicine in Canada, before moving to New York and Washington, D.C., where he claimed to have first been introduced to Abraham Lincoln. Tumblety's medicinal approach was based on herbal remedies over mineral \\"poisons\\" (mercury) or surgical techniques.Roscoe, Theodore (1959) The Web of Conspiracy, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., pp. 301‚Äì302, 502 He was connected to the death of one of his patients in Boston,Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 611‚Äì616; Rumbelow, p. 265; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 126 but escaped prosecution. In 1858 he returned to Rochester apparently a rich man, making an ostentatious display of his wealth and new social standing, and claiming that it had been achieved through patenting of his medicinal cures.'The Whitechapel Murders', 'Secret History, Season 4, Episode 2, (1996), Channel 4 Television, England. Federal tax records show he was in Maryland in early 1863,IRS tax assessment list, District 4; Annual Lists, 1863 and Monthly Lists, Nov 1862 ‚Äì Apr 1864 but he soon moved to St. Louis, Missouri, living at 50 Olive Street.IRS tax assessment list, District 1 Special Lists; Jan‚ÄìAug 1865 On May 5, 1865, he was arrested in St. Louis and taken to Washington on orders of the Secretary of War for alleged complicity in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, because the police believed that he was an associate of David Herold, who was captured with John Wilkes Booth. Tumblety denied any association with Herold, and there was nothing to tie him to the plot, so Tumblety was released without charge on May 30.Selected Records of the War Department Relating to Confederate Prisoners of War, 1861‚Äì1865, Roll M598_110 In 1881 he was arrested in New Orleans for pick pocketing. Tumblety appeared to revel in denouncing all women, but reserved a special hatred for prostitutes; he blamed his misogyny on a failed marriage to a prostitute. In Washington, D.C., he displayed a collection of uteruses preserved in jars, which he kept in his study, to his guests at an all-male dinner party, and proudly boasted that they came from \\"every class of woman\\". Jack the Ripper suspect Tumblety visited Europe several times, including Ireland, Scotland, England, Germany, and France. He claimed to have been introduced to Charles Dickens and King William and to have provided treatment to Louis Napoleon, for which he was awarded the Cross of the Legion of Honor. During one visit he became closely acquainted with writer Hall Caine.Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 203 As a young man of 21 Caine encountered the self-proclaimed ‚ÄòGreat American Doctor‚Äô, aged 43, after he set up at 177 Duke Street, Liverpool in 1874, offering herbal cure-all elixirs and Patent medicines to the public, which he claimed were secrets of the American Indians. Following the death of Edward Hanratty in January 1875, the same night he took a spoon of medicine supplied by Tumblety, and action taken by William Carroll to sue Tumblety for ¬£200 after allegedly publishing a false testimonial, Tumblety fled to London. Many newspapers reported the stories and in the wake of this adverse publicity, Tumblety recruited Caine to edit his biography. The pamphlet entitled Passages from the Life of Dr Francis Tumblety, the fourth of Tumblety's biographies, was published in March 1875. Professional police officers and amateur historical researchers Stewart Evans and Paul Gainey, detailed evidence in their 1996 book Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer that Tumblety was temporarily resident in a boarding house in the Whitechapel district during the brief period of the murder rampage of Jack the Ripper, and pieced together a case that he may be the culprit.Rumbelow, pp. 265‚Äì266 The Metropolitan Police arrested Tumblety on 7 November 1888 on unrelated charges of gross indecency, apparently for having been caught engaging in a homosexual encounter, which was illegal at the time.Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, p. 621 Whilst awaiting trial on this charge on bail of ¬£300 (equivalent to ¬£ today), and knowing that Scotland Yard was increasingly interested in him with regard to the recent murder spree in Whitechapel, he fled England for France on 20 November under the false name of Frank Townsend, and on 24 November 1888 he returned to the United States.Ludington Record, 20 December 1888 Already notorious in the United States for his self-promotion and previous brushes with the law, Tumblety's arrest in London was reported in The New York Times as being connected to the Ripper murders.Rumbelow, p. 266 American newspaper reports that Scotland Yard tried to extradite him have not been confirmed by research in the contemporary British press or the London police files.Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, p. 616 However, English police inspector Walter Andrews travelled to America, perhaps partly to trace Tumblety. The New York City Police, who had him under surveillance, said \\"there is no proof of his complicity in the Whitechapel murders, and the crime for which he is under bond in London is not extraditable\\".Chief Inspector Byrnes quoted in Begg, p. 280 Tumblety published a self-aggrandising pamphlet titled Dr. Francis Tumblety ‚Äì Sketch of the Life of the Gifted, Eccentric and World Famed Physician, in which he attacked the rumours in the press but omitted any mention of his criminal charges and arrest.Rumbelow, p. 267 Tumblety was mentioned as a Ripper suspect by former Detective Chief Inspector John Littlechild of the Metropolitan Police in a letter to journalist and author George R. Sims, dated 23 September 1913, which was discovered by Evans and Gainey for sale in an antiquarian bookshop in Richmond-upon-Thames. Littlechild suspected Tumblety because of his extreme misogyny and his previous criminal record. Other Ripperologists have dismissed Tumblety as a plausible Ripper suspect, citing the fact that his appearance and age did not match the description of any of the men that were seen with the murder victims, and that his relatively tall height of at least and enormous moustache would have made him particularly conspicuous.Rumbelow, p. 267; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 126 However, a contemporary interview describes Tumblety as having a much smaller moustache at the time of the Whitechapel murders than is seen in the well-known photograph of him.Evans, Stewart P. (August 2007) \\"A Slouch-Hatted Yank\\", Ripperologist No. 82, republished at Casebook: Jack the Ripper, retrieved 3 January 2011 Last years Tumblety returned to Rochester and moved in with an elderly female relative, whose house also served as his office.Rumbelow, p. 268; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 126 He was living in Baltimore, Maryland, during the 1900 census,US Census 1900, Supervisor's District III ‚Äì 1st District, Md, enumerator district 20, sheet 14 but returned to St Louis, where he died in 1903 of heart disease.

Summary Already known as a critic of affirmative action or race-based hiring and promotion, Sowell, himself African-American, analyzes the specific effects of such policies on India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Nigeria, four countries with longer multiethnic histories and then compares them with the recent history of the United States in this regard. He finds that \\"Such programs have at best a negligible impact on the groups they are intended to assist.\\" A sample of his thinking about perpetual racial preferences is this passage from page 7: According to Dutch Martin's review of this book: :Among the common consequences of preference policies in the five-country sample are: *They encourage non-preferred groups to redesignate themselves as members of preferred groups (1) to take advantage of group preference policies; *They tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g. black millionaires), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g. poor whites); *They reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best--the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile--thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole. Sowell concludes: \\"Despite sweeping claims made for affirmative action programs, an examination of their actual consequences makes it hard to support those claims, or even to say that these programs have been beneficial on net balance.\\" Arguments First, in repudiating what he refers to as the \\"myths\\" surrounding affirmative action, he contends that blacks had both higher rates of labor force participation and higher marriage rates before the 1960s' large-scale institution of civil rights laws and policies countering discrimination. Much of the economic upturn, which Sowell attributes entirely to personal initiative, must be put in the context of the postwar economic boom, which was accompanied by the widespread availability of manual jobs requiring little education. The post-civil rights period coincided with an economy that was experiencing steady de-industrialization. Significantly, manufacturing jobs that had been stepping-stones into the middle class for blacks from the U.S. South and immigrants from southern, eastern, and central Europe in the past, were fast eroding. Second, he questions the conventional wisdom that has evolved around affirmative action. He claims that there is nothing beyond assertions and anecdotes to prove that diversity enhances the college experience for all students; that there is no systematic evidence that black \\"role models\\" are essential to the education of black students; that a \\"critical mass\\" of black students in the academic setting might actually be detrimental to the education of black students; and finally that black studies programs are \\"ideological crusades\\" which provide sanctuary for intellectual lightweights. It is this last point which makes up the bulk of his discussion on how affirmative action has led to a mismatch between minority students and the institutions they attend, setting them up either for failure or turning them out to be bad doctors and lawyers. Sowell asserts that colleges and universities which pledge to \\"develop minds and skills that serve society at large cannot be subordinated to the impossible task of equalizing probabilities of academic success for people born and raised in circumstances which have handicapped their development, even if for reasons that are not their fault and are beyond their control\\" (p. 153). Third, Sowell is highly critical of William Bowen and Derek Bok, former university presidents of Princeton and Harvard, whose 1998 book The Shape of the River caused quite a stir when it revealed how race-sensitive admissions policies increased the likelihood that blacks would be admitted to selective universities and that upon graduation these students were more likely to become leaders of community and social service organizations. Fourth, he argues that in the United States as in other countries, the original rationale for affirmative action has little to do with how it actually is practiced. The disproportionate benefit that well-placed, affluent blacks receive, with little if any going to those who continue to suffer the most, has discredited the ethos of affirmative action more than anything. On this last point, few disagree. Critical reception The Economist magazine praised the book as \\"terse, well argued and utterly convincing\\" and \\"crammed with striking anecdotes and statistics.\\" For the Sacramento News & Review, Chris Springer asserts that Sowell's selection of countries for comparison to the United States and his use of evidence was skewed to reach an anti-affirmative-action conclusion. The same review charges that Sowell simply repackaged an earlier book of his, Preferential Policies: An International Perspective (1990), and \\"fobbed it off\\" as new material under a different title. Michael B√©rub√©, writing for The Nation magazine, agreed with Sowell's arguments that affirmative action has gone far beyond what the Civil Rights Act of 1965 intended and that preferential benefits for ethnic groups without historical oppression in the United States are unjustified but criticized Sowell's association of affirmative action with unrest in the countries selected for the study and pointed out the United States has never implemented the racial preference systems of those foreign countries.

He was educated at Clifton College near Bristol in England, and at both the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and the University of Otago in New Zealand. He was subsequently appointed engineer for the District of Otago. On 1 September 1876, with John Reid and James W. Duncan, the partnership, 'Reid and Duncans', Surveyors, Civil Engineers, Land Agents, and Share and Money Brokers was formed, with offices at Moray Place, Dunedin.'Public Notices' Otago Daily Times , Issue 4537, 1 September 1876, p.3, col.1 Between 1879 and 1883, Duncan was responsible for the development of the Dunedin cable tramway system. He was then appointed consulting engineer (and subsequently engineer) for the development of the Melbourne cable tramway system in Australia, a post he held until 1892, being largely responsible for the development of over 44 miles of cable tram route. Shortly after leaving his post in Melbourne, Duncan travelled to both America and Europe. Whilst in London he was elected a Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers for his efforts on the Melbourne cable tramway system. However what he saw on his travels lead him to question the future of cable tramways, and on his return to Australia he advised Brisbane against adopting such a system in favour of electric traction. From 1894, Duncan became involved in the gold mining industry of Victoria, introducing the cyanide process for extracting gold from ore and mine tailings, and founding the firm of Duncan, Noyes & Co. He later became involved in experiments to extract gold from seawater, and achieved this in 1912 from the waters of Port Phillip. He continued to experiment until shortly before his death, but failed in his aim of making the process economically viable.

A CN system-wide rebranding beginning in 1995 has seen the DWP logo and name largely replaced by its parent company. The DWP line is CN's connection between International Falls and Duluth, Minnesota, where the railroad connects to a short stretch of the former Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway before following the former Wisconsin Central (both now wholly owned by CN) to Chicago, Illinois. In 1970 DW&P; reported 792 million ton-miles of revenue freight and no passenger miles; at the end of that year it operated of road and of track. History The Duluth, Virginia and Rainy Lake Railway (DV&RL;) started construction at Virginia, Minnesota, in 1901, with the line extending north to Sand Lake, Minnesota, when the company was purchased by the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) who renamed it the Duluth, Rainy Lake and Winnipeg Railway (DRL&W;). Construction continued through 1908 to extend the line north to Ranier, Minnesota, where it bridged the Rainy River on the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border to cross into Fort Frances, Ontario, and an interchange with the CNoR mainline between Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Port Arthur, Ontario. In 1909, CNoR incorporated the Duluth, Winnipeg and Pacific Railway, and construction started to achieve access south from Virginia, Minnesota, to Duluth, Minnesota. Duluth was reached in 1912, providing interchange with several US railways. The DW&P; mainline ran for from Duluth Junction at Fort Frances (CNoR interchange) to DW&P; Junction (Northern Pacific Railway (U.S.)). Following the bankruptcy of the CNoR system and its subsequent nationalization by Canada's federal government under the Canadian National Railways (CNR), the DW&P; was maintained as an important connection for CNR to the upper mid- western states. During the post-war era, the DW&P; line was upgraded to handle an increase in freight and unit train traffic, such as potash, lumber and paper. In 1960 CNR changed its name to \\"Canadian National/Canadien National\\" (CN) and introduced a radical new paint scheme and logo. At the same time, DW&P; was changed to just DWP and given a logo of similar flowing design to the CN \\"noodle\\". CN's other US subsidiary, Grand Trunk Western Railroad also underwent a similar name/acronym change to Grand Trunk Western (GT). The DW&P;'s primary passenger terminal in Duluth was via the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha's (Chicago & North Western) brick/stone structure at 5th Avenue West in the city's downtown area, not far from Duluth Union Depot (served by St. Paul & Duluth [Northern Pacific], Duluth & Iron Range, and Duluth, Missabe & Northern). The company eventually opened its own three-story facility in West Duluth during spring 1913 although it was only used as a secondary terminal, primarily housing offices while also maintaining mail/express business. Finally, trackage rights were secured over Northern Pacific for to Rices Point Yard where it gained direct freight interchange points with NP and Milwaukee Road. Within just a few years of the \\"Peg's\\" opening, parent Canadian Northern found itself in dire financial straits. It was turned over to the government on September 6, 1918, and later nationalized as part of the Canadian National Railways, incorporated on June 6, 1919. The DW&P; maintained a separate identity during this corporate reshuffling and later became part of CN's Grand Trunk Corporation formed on July 31, 1971, which maintained CN's American holdings. DWP began to play an increasingly important role for CN in the 1990s, following the implementation of the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement (FTA), and later the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which contributed to increases in Canadian exports south and US imports north. The DWP provided the most direct connection from CN's western Canadian trackage to the major US interchanges at Chicago, Illinois, however unlike rival Canadian Pacific Railway which had its own Soo Line Railroad subsidiary trackage to use, CN was forced to interchange with US railroads at Duluth, such as Great Northern (later Burlington Northern Railroad, later Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway) or Wisconsin Central Ltd.. In the mid-1990s, CN and WC entered into a formal agreement whereby WC agreed to haul CN trains to Chicago. The mid-1990s also saw a major change in how US subsidiaries like DWP and GT fit into CN's corporate structure whereby in 1993‚Äì1994, CN changed the name of its entire system to \\"CN North America\\" (CNNA) and began a major locomotive and freight car repainting program which saw the GT and DWP logos and names disappear, with only the holding company \\"Grand Trunk Corporation\\" remaining on paper and legal documents. In 1995, the CNNA experiment ended and the name \\"Canadian National/Canadien National\\" with the CN acronym returned, only system-wide in both countries. On November 28, 1995, Canada's federal government privatized CN and its US subsidiaries. In 2001, CN entered into an agreement to purchase WC entirely on October 21 of that year, providing CN with an \\"iron lariat\\" encircling the industrially- important Great Lakes Basin. The only gap in CN's Winnipeg‚ÄìFort Frances/International Falls‚ÄìChicago mainline route was a short section in Duluth where CN had to operate on the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway to reach WC trackage from the end of DWP trackage. On May 10, 2004, CN purchased DMIR's parent company Great Lakes Transportation to give total control of the Winnipeg‚ÄìChicago corridor and remove the gap at Duluth between DWP and WC trackage. Merger with Wisconsin Central thumb In December 2011, the Duluth, Winnipeg and Pacific Railway was merged into Wisconsin Central Ltd., which is also controlled by Canadian National Railway. This merger was intended to increase efficiency.

It links the classical electrostatic self-interaction energy of a homogeneous charge distribution to the electron's relativistic mass‚Äìenergy. According to modern understanding, the electron is a point particle with a point charge and no spatial extent. Attempts to model the electron as a non-point particle have been described as ill-conceived and counter-pedagogic. Nevertheless, it is useful to define a length that characterizes electron interactions in atomic-scale problems. The classical electron radius is given as (in SI units) :r_\\\\text{e} = \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0}\\\\frac{e^2}{m_{\\\\text{e}} c^2} = 2.817 940 3227(19) \\\\times 10^{-15} \\\\text{ m} , where e is the elementary charge, m_{\\\\text{e}} is the electron mass, c is the speed of light, and \\\\varepsilon_0 is the permittivity of free space.David J. Griffiths, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, Prentice-Hall, 1995, p. 155. This numerical value is several times larger than the radius of the proton. In cgs units, the permittivity factor does not enter, but the classical electron radius has the same value. The classical electron radius is sometimes known as the Lorentz radius or the Thomson scattering length. It is one of a trio of related scales of length, the other two being the Bohr radius a_0 and the Compton wavelength of the electron \\\\lambda_\\\\text{e}. The classical electron radius is built from the electron mass m_\\\\text{e}, the speed of light c and the electron charge e. The Bohr radius is built from m_\\\\text{e}, e and the Planck constant h. The Compton wavelength is built from m_\\\\text{e}, h and c. Any one of these three length scales can be written in terms of any other using the fine structure constant \\\\alpha: :r_\\\\text{e} = {{\\\\hbar c \\\\alpha} \\\\over {m_\\\\text{e} c^2}} = {\\\\lambda_\\\\text{e} \\\\alpha \\\\over {2\\\\pi}}={a_0 \\\\alpha^2}. Derivation The classical electron radius length scale can be motivated by considering the energy necessary to assemble an amount of charge q into a sphere of a given radius r. The electrostatic potential at a distance r from a charge q is :V(r) = \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0}\\\\frac{q}{r}. To bring an additional amount of charge dq from infinity necessitates putting energy into the system, dU, by an amount :dU = V(r) dq . If the sphere is assumed to have constant charge density, \\\\rho, then :q = \\\\rho \\\\frac{4}{3} \\\\pi r^3 and dq = \\\\rho 4 \\\\pi r^2 dr. Doing the integration for r starting at zero up to a final radius r leads to the expression for the total energy, U, necessary to assemble total charge q into a uniform sphere of radius r: :U = \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\frac{3}{5} \\\\frac{q^2}{r}. This is called the electrostatic self-energy of the object. The charge q is now interpreted as the electron charge, e, and the energy U is set equal to the relativistic mass-energy of the electron, m c^2, and the numerical factor 3/5 is ignored as being specific to the special case of a uniform charge density. The radius r is then defined to be the classical electron radius, r_\\\\text{e}, and one arrives at the expression given above. Note that this derivation does not say that r_\\\\text{e} is the actual radius of an electron. It only establishes a dimensional link between electrostatic self energy and the mass-energy scale of the electron. Discussion The electron radius occurs in the classical limit of modern theories as well, such as non- relativistic Thomson scattering and the relativistic Klein‚ÄìNishina formula. Also, r_\\\\text{e} is roughly the length scale at which renormalization becomes important in quantum electrodynamics. That is, at short-enough distances, quantum fluctuations within the vacuum of space surrounding an electron begin to have calculable effects that have measurable consequences in atomic and particle physics.

It is one of the well-defined community areas in the city of Chicago. History Once part of Cicero Township in 1869, the eastern section of North Lawndale to Pulaski Road was annexed to Chicago by an act of the state legislature. Thereafter, streets were platted and drainage ditches were installed between Western (2400 west) and Pulaski Road (4000 west). The name \\"Lawndale\\" was supplied by Millard and Decker, a real estate firm which subdivided the area in 1870. In 1871, after the Great Chicago Fire, the McCormick Reaper Company (later International Harvester) constructed and occupied a new large plant in the South Lawndale neighborhood. As a result, many plant workers moved to eastern North Lawndale. The remaining area west of Crawford Avenue was annexed in 1889 by a resolution of the Cook County Commissioners. By 1890 North Lawndale was beginning to be heavily populated by Bohemian immigrants from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The section most populated by the Czechs was the area from Crawford (Pulaski) west, and from 12th St. (Roosevelt Rd.) to 16th St. Real estate firm W.A. Merigold & Co. was the chief developer of that part of the community, which resulted in the name \\"Merigold\\" being associated with the neighborhood. Czech institutions popped up in Merigold, beginning in 1890 with the Slovanska Lipa/Sokol Tabor (Czech fraternal & gymnastic organization) at 13th & Karlov. In 1892 the Bohemian Catholic Church, Our Lady of Lourdes, was established at the corner of 15th & Keeler. In 1909 the Czech Freethinkers School, Frantisek Palacky, was built at 1525 S. Kedvale. The Merigold neighborhood was also known as Novy Tabor (New Camp) by the Czech immigrants who settled there. The premier Czech institution, established in 1912, was the Ceska Beseda (Bohemian Club) at 3659 W. Douglas Blvd. This club was attended by Chicago's Czech elite, as well as the visiting Czech elite of the rest of the United States and Czechoslovakia. It was the place for its members to celebrate and enjoy literature, drama, and music by the most renowned and talented Czech artists. The ethnic Bohemians spread throughout the rest of the North Lawndale neighborhood; they were the original owners of many of the beautiful greystone buildings that graced the picturesque streets of the neighborhood. Many of the elite members of the Bohemian community resided in the vicinity of the 1800 and 1900 blocks of South Millard Avenue. These wealthy men, as well as the rest of the Czech residents of North Lawndale, were strongly committed to their neighborhood, and were involved in civic affairs. Anton Dvorak Public Elementary School at 3615 W. 16th St. was named after the revered 19th-century Czech composer Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k. Several members of the North Lawndale Czech community occupied positions in city as well as county government. In the post-World War I years, the Czechs began leaving the neighborhood for newer housing in the western suburbs of Cicero, Berwyn, Riverside, and Brookfield. By the 1920s many of the Czechs were gone, and Jews became the majority ethnic group of the neighborhood after having left the crowded confines of the Maxwell Street ghetto. North Lawndale later became known as being the largest Jewish settlement in the City of Chicago, with 25% of the city's Jewish population.Steans Family Foundation, Chicago, 2009. Retrieved on 2010-05-11. From about 1918 to 1955, Jews, overwhelmingly of Russian and Eastern European origin, dominated the neighborhood, starting in North Lawndale and moving northward as they became more prosperous. In the 1950s, blacks migrated into the area from the South Side and from southern states. Unscrupulous real- estate dealers all but evacuated the white population by using blockbusting and scare tactics related to the change in ethnicity. In a span of about ten years, the white population of North Lawndale dropped from 99% to less than 9%, but the number of total residents increased. According to the Steans Family Foundation, in the decades following the 1960s :there were a series of economic and social disasters ... Riots followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., in 1968, destroying many of the stores along Roosevelt Road and accelerating a decline that led to a loss of 75% of the businesses in the community by 1970. Industries closed: International Harvester in 1969, Sears (partially in 1974 and completely by 1987), Zenith and Sunbeam in the 1970s, Western Electric in the 1980s. By 1970 African Americans who could also left North Lawndale, beginning a precipitous population decline that continues to this day. The poverty resulting from the loss of thousands of jobs due to restructuring of industries from the 1960s to the 1980s meant that money was not available for property maintenance. Houses were abandoned and thousands of structures were leveled during this time. Much land sat vacant until the building and real estate boom of the 2000s. Due to these factors, the total neighborhood population dropped from 124,937 in 1960 to 41,768 by 2000. Writer, Jonathan Kozol devotes a chapter of Savage Inequalities: Children in America's Schools (1991) to North Lawndale. He notes that a local resident called it \\"an industrial slum without the industry.\\"Jonathan Kozol (1991): Savage Inequalities: Children in America's Schools, Crown, At the time, it had \\"one bank, one supermarket, 48 state lottery agents ... and 99 licensed bars.\\" According to the 1980 census, 58 percent of men and women 17 and older had no jobs. In 1986 the Steans Family Foundation was founded to concentrate on grantmaking and programs in North Lawndale. In the 1990s, the foundation noted signs of revitalization, \\"including a new shopping plaza and some new housing\\" associated with Homan Square, stabilization of the declining population, and a rise in new residents, mostly Hispanic. They constituted 4.5% of the population. According to Charles Leeks, director of NHS, North Lawndale has the greatest concentration of greystones in the city. In late 2004, the City of Chicago enacted \\"The Historic Chicago Greystone Initiative\\" to promote the preservation of the neighborhood's greystone structures. = Contract Buyers League = The Contract Buyers League (CBL) was a grassroots organization formed in 1968 by residents of the North Lawndale community. Assisted by Jack MacNamara, a Jesuit seminarian, and twelve white college students based at Presentation Roman Catholic Church, led by Msgr. Jack Egan, the CBL fought the discriminatory real estate practice known as \\"contract selling.\\" Groups similar to the CBL formed in cities around the country to combat contract selling. The CBL was the most influential in winning justice for exploited black homebuyers. The CBL renegotiated 400 contracts for its members, saving residents an estimated $25,000,000. The FHA finally responded to pressure from the CBL by reforming its discriminatory underwriting policies in order to lend to blacks. The history of redlining was documented and broadcast by a 2014 cover story in The Atlantic monthly magazine titled \\"The Case for Reparations\\" written by journalist and award-winning author Ta-Nehisi Coates. North Lawndale was featured in an accompanying mini-documentary video explaining the impact of housing discrimination and predatory lending in Chicago titled ‚ÄúThe Story of the Contract Buyers.\\" Subsections = K-Town = K-Town is a nickname for an area in Humboldt Park, North Lawndale, and West Garfield ParkAlthough these long streets extend beyond the bounds of North Lawndale, and West Garfield Park, published sources identify the name K-Town as referring specifically to an area of North Lawndale, and West Garfield Park, i.e. the area through which these streets pass. between Pulaski Road and Cicero Avenue in which the names of many north-south avenues begin with the letter K (Keystone, Karlov, Kedvale, Keeler, Kenneth, Kilbourn, Kildare, Kolin, Kolmar, Komensky, Kostner, Kilpatrick, Kenton, Knox, and Keating). The pattern is a historical relic of a 1913 street-naming proposal, by which streets were to be systematically named according to their distance from the Illinois-Indiana border; K, the eleventh letter, was to be assigned to streets within the eleventh mile, counting west from the state line. The eleventh mile is the easternmost area in which the plan was widely implemented, as many neighborhoods to the east were already developed and had street names in place. The portion of K-Town bounded by W. Kinzie St, W. Cermak Rd, S. Kostner Ave, and S. Pulaski Rd was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places on September 9, 2010. John W. Fountain wrote in his 2005 memoir: =Homan Square= The site of the former Sears headquarters was redeveloped beginning in 1988 as Homan Square. The development has included new construction of owned and rental mixed-income housing; adaptive reuse and restoration of historic properties for use as community center, school, and other facilities; a new community pool and recreation center; and associated retail. Homan Square is often used as an example of the revitalization of North Lawndale. The former Sears tower was rehabbed and reopened to the public as \\"The John D. and Alexandra C. Nichols Tower\\" in 2015. It now houses non-profit groups and youth association offices. Despite the renaming, the tower retains the \\"Sears Roebuck\\" plaque on top of the building. The 14th floor of the tower is now used as a space for parties and other community events. A windowless portion of the building indicates the tower's former connection to the Sears Merchandise Building. The complex before demolition was situated along the former Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad line (now CSX). Homan Square was the area that housed a police compound \\"likened to a CIA black site\\" in 2012, where people were held without their rights being respected. Government and infrastructure The United States Postal Service operates the Otis Grant Collins Post Office at 2302 South Pulaski Road. Crime Historian Paul Street, citing a 2001 demographic study by Claritas Inc., writes that more than 70% of men aged 18‚Äì45 residing in North Lawndale had criminal records.

He later served the federal government as an Indian agent working with the Cherokee in southeastern Tennessee. Early life and service in American Revolution Meigs was born in Middletown, Connecticut, on December 17, 1740, to Jonathan Meigs and Elizabeth Hamlin Meigs. Their thirteen children included his brother Josiah Meigs.William M. Meigs, Life of Josiah Meigs, Philadelphia (J.P. Murphy, printer), 1887. pp. 4-5. His father was a hatter. As a young man, Meigs entered a mercantile business. He married Joanna Winborn in 1764. Before her death in 1773, they had four children, including Return Jonathan Meigs, Jr.. In 1774, Meigs married Grace Starr, with whom he had three children, of whom two survived. Meigs is shown in the left foreground of The Death of General Montgomery in the Attack on Quebec, December 31, 1775 John Trumbull, 1786 Meigs served in the local militia, achieving the rank of lieutenant in 1772 and promoted to captain in 1774. On April 19, 1775, after the Battle of Lexington, he led a company of light infantry to Boston. There he was appointed major in the 2nd Connecticut Regiment, a provincial regiment of the Continental Army. Later that year, serving as a division (battalion) commander under Colonel Benedict Arnold, he accompanied Arnold on his 1,100-man expedition through Maine to Canada. He kept a journal of the expedition, making the ink by mixing powder and water in the palm of his hand. Meigs was captured by the British in the assault on Quebec City and imprisoned, but was paroled on May 16, 1776, by British General Guy Carleton. He was acknowledged to have given decent treatment to a British prisoner, Captain Law, Carleton's chief engineer. Meigs returned to Connecticut by way of Halifax.The Magazine of American History with Notes and Queries, by John Austin Stevens, Benjamin Franklin DeCosta, Martha Joanna Lamb, Henry Phelps Johnston, Nathan Gillett Pond, William Abbatt.

Six volumes, New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1887-1889, accessed 2006-03-09 After Meigs was formally exchanged on January 10, 1777, he returned to active service as major of the 3rd Connecticut Regiment of the newly organized Connecticut Line. Meigs was appointed lieutenant colonel of Sherburne's Additional Continental Regiment on February 10, 1777. On May 12 of that year, he was sent to command the 6th Connecticut Regiment when its colonel, William Douglas, became incapacitated by ill health. One of his most important achievements during the Revolutionary War was leading the Meigs Raid against the British forces in Sag Harbor, New York, in May 1777. With just 220 men in a fleet of 13 whaleboats, he crossed Long Island Sound from Connecticut to Long Island to attack the British fleet at night. The raid succeeded in burning twelve ships and taking ninety prisoners without losing a single man.\\"Sag Harbor: A Port Bigger Than New York\\", Newsday - Our Town series] The U.S. Congress awarded Meigs a presentation sword for his heroism. Colonel Douglas died on May 28, and Governor Trumbull of Connecticut appointed Meigs as the new colonel of the 6th Connecticut on September 10, 1777, with rank counted from May 12th. When a Corps of Light Infantry was formed under General Anthony Wayne in July 1779, Meigs was given command of its 3rd Regiment, which he led at the Battle of Stony Point. Following its disbandment in December, he returned to the 6th Connecticut and became acting commander of the 1st Connecticut Brigade. In that capacity, he put down an incipient mutiny and received the written thanks of General George Washington. On January 1, 1781, the Continental Main Army was reorganized and many of its regiments were consolidated. As a result, the Connecticut Line was reduced from eight to five regiments and four colonels, including Meigs, were retired. Ohio After the Revolution, Meigs was appointed surveyor of the Ohio Company of Associates. In April 1788, at age 47, he was one of a party of pioneers to the Northwest Territory from New England. They reached the confluence of the Muskingum and Ohio rivers, where he participated in the founding of Marietta, Ohio. Meigs drafted the code of regulations used for governance until the formal creation of the Northwest Territory the following year.Ohio Fundamental Documents Return J. Meigs, Jr. Biography \\"Return Jonathan Meigs surveyor's field notes\\", Marietta College Library, Manuscripts and Documents of the Ohio Company of Associates Collection, accessed April 4, 2009 Subsequently, he entered political life, being appointed as a territorial judge, a justice of the peace, and clerk of the Court of Quarter Sessions. In 1795, he served the army under General Anthony Wayne, as a commissary of clothing in the western country. In 1799, Meigs was elected as a member of the Ohio territorial legislature, serving until 1801. Tennessee In 1801, Meigs went to Tennessee to fill the combined position of US Indian agent to the Cherokee Nation and military agent for the United States War Department. Initially his office and the Cherokee Agency were at Fort Southwest Point, in what is now Kingston, Tennessee. In 1807 he relocated these operations to a new post further south, named Hiwassee Garrison. It was near the mouth of the Hiwassee River, at its confluence with the Tennessee River. Charles R. Hicks, a mixed-race (European and Cherokee) and bilingual Cherokee, worked as his interpreter for some time. Hicks later became a chief of the Cherokee. Meigs' role as military agent ended in 1813 when the Federal soldiers stationed at Hiwassee Garrison were withdrawn. He continued as Cherokee agent on the Hiwassee River until his death on January 28, 1823. The government's trading or factory operations were linked with Indian relations in the War Department during these years. As Cherokee agent, Meigs promoted the well-being of the Cherokee, defended their rights in treaty negotiations, and encouraged Cherokee efforts to establish a republican form of government.* His death was attributed to pneumonia contracted from sleeping outdoors in a tent while giving a visiting Indian chief his own living quarters. Meigs is buried in the Garrison Cemetery in Rhea County, Tennessee, near the site of the former Hiwassee Garrison. Legacy His son Return J. Meigs, Jr. was elected as Ohio governor and later, by the legislature, as U.S. Senator. A grandson, Return J. Meigs IV, married Jennie Ross, daughter of principal Cherokee chief John Ross. They emigrated with her father to Indian Territory in 1838, forced out on the Trail of Tears.Emmet Starr (1922), History of the Cherokee Indians and their legends and folk lore Two Tennessee place names honor Meigs: Meigs County, which was formed in 1836 from part of Rhea County, and Meigs Mountain in the Great Smoky Mountains.

It was published in 2002 for the 5th edition Hero System release. The cover is thick paper and illustrated in color, while the interior is 239 pages in length and illustrated in black and white. An earlier edition of the Hero Bestiary was published in 1992 for the prior edition of Hero. This work is divided into four chapters and an appendix. The first chapter gives an overview of creatures in a role-playing game, along with descriptions of the game system statistics and how creatures are created using the Hero System point build method. Each of the skills common to animals is described in terms of how it is applied to the various life forms. The application of powers and their limitations is detailed specifically for creatures such as animals, and the various disadvantages are explained in terms of how they are best applied. New with this release is a section in chapter one on Creature Templates. These are sets of powers with appropriate advantages and limitations that can be applied to modify a creature. Thus there are templates for size modification, elemental forms, undead, venomous creatures, disease carriers, mutations, and so forth. These templates significantly multiply the variety of creatures available to the game master. The first chapter also has a section on how creatures fight and behave in combat, as well as providing custom hit location tables for common creature forms that differ from a humanoid shape. The chapter closes with some comments on animal populations, as well as the commercial value of various animal parts. The remaining three chapters consist of creature statistics and descriptions for fantastic beasts, animals, and beasts of science fiction and the movies. Each creature description is about a page in length, and contains a complete listing of the characteristics, powers, skills, and disadvantages, including the point cost for each. This is followed by brief descriptions of the creature's ecology, personality and motivation, powers and combat tactics, their appearance, and the uses of the creature in a role-playing game campaign. The creatures listed include a number that are as intelligent as man (or more so), and can possess their own intricate cultures. All of the creatures are illustrated in black and white. The book closes with a bibliography and an appendix. The latter includes various sample template- modified creatures, an extensive list of hit location tables, area of effect maps for various powers, and a creature summary table. At the end is an index. Altogether the book includes complete statistics for the following creatures: *Fantastic Beasts -- guardian ape, basilisk, giant vampire bat, centaur, chimera (mythology), cockatrice, giant crab, deadly ooze, various demons and devils, dragons, elementals, giant frog, gargoyle, golems, gorgon, griffin, harpy, hippocampus, hippogriff, homunculus, hydra, giant insects, jackalope, kraken, giant lizard, lycanthropes, manticore, minotaur, pegasus, Phoenix, rakshasa, giant rat, roc, salamander, satyr, sea serpent, simurgh, siren, fantastic snakes, sphinx, tree man, undead (ghost, ghoul, mummy, animated skeleton, vampire, and zombie), unicorn, giant wolf, and giant worm. *Mundane Beasts -- barracuda, bat, bears, birds of prey, other birds, boar, buffalo, camel, domestic cat, great cats (cheetah, leopard, lion, smilodon, and tiger), chimpanzee, giant clam, crocodile, deer, dinosaurs, dogs, dolphin, eel, elephant, gorilla, hippopotamus, horses, small mammals, rhinoceros, scorpion, sharks, snakes, spiders, animal swarms, swordfish, whales, and wolves. *Beasts of Science Fiction and the Movies -- amorphous horror, animal-men, giant ape, chromedog, engine of destruction, giant carnivorous plants, giant dinosaur, giant space amoeba, living brain, mon'da hunting lizard, neuroparasite, psychovore, robots and androids, slasher, swamp creature, and xenovore creatures.

Operations The seventh of the first lot of 10 Castles built in 1923/4, No.4079 \\"Pendennis Castle\\" was completed at Swindon Works on 4 March 1924. It was allocated to Old Oak Common locomotive depot. The locomotive became famous in 1925 when the GWR lent it to the London & North Eastern Railway as part of trials against the LNER's then new A1 Pacific Class, a famous example being LNER 4472 Flying Scotsman. Running from King's Cross to Grantham, and King's Cross to Doncaster, it made the ascent from King's Cross to Finsbury Park regularly in less than six minutes, a feat that the Pacifics were unable to match. Pendennis Castle was also shown to be more economical in both coal and water on the test runs, its superiority in burning unfamiliar Yorkshire coal being measured at 3.7lb per mile. Before returning to the GWR, the locomotive attended the second Wembley Exhibition between May and October 1925, displayed next to Flying Scotsman, with a notice proclaiming it to be the most powerful passenger express locomotive in Britain. Back at Old Oak Common, it continued to run the routes to South Wales and the West Country until after the GWR was nationalised post-World War II to become part of British Railways. In August 1950 it was allocated to Gloucester shed, in March 1959 to Bristol (Bath Road), and its last shed allocation was Bristol (Saint Philip's Marsh). It was withdrawn in May 1964.http://www.greatwestern.org.uk/m_in_cas_castle4.htm In May 1964 it was booked to work the London Paddington to Taunton leg of Z48 on Saturday 9 May, where upon arrival at Westbury it was discovered that it had melted its firebars from the heat of its fire, blamed on the provision of unusually high-calorific-value, carefully screened coal which caused the fire to burn white-hot as the speed exceeded 90 mph. This special coal had been sourced in a well-meaning gesture by British Railways in the knowledge that the Castle would be deliberately pushed as close to 100 mph as possible on its last scheduled service. As there was no standby Castle at Westbury and the closest Castle was in Taunton GWR 6999 Capel Dewi Hall took its train onto Taunton where 7025 Sudeley Castle took over for the journey to Plymouth. Preservation In the engine shed at Didcot (2001) Pendennis Castle undergoing restoration at Didcot (2005) =Early preserved years= Acquired from BR in 1964 by Mike Higson, she was moved to Southall Railway Centre and appeared at one of the Great Western Society's first open days in 1965. After then being purchased by a partnership of the Honourable John Gretton and Sir Bill McAlpine, the locomotive was moved in 1967 to the former GWR depot at Didcot, taking up residence in the disused lifting shop. As the Great Western Society assembled and moved its collection there, the Castle made rare excursions at Didcot, and made her next public appearance in 1971. In 1972 she moved to Market Overton, Rutland. After that project failed, and having been welded to the track by disillusioned project members, she moved to Steamtown, Carnforth where McAlpine held controlling-ownership. Being built to the larger GWR loading gauge, she was unable to run on the former London Midland and Scottish Railway tracks, and with tension growing between the owners, it was agreed to sell her. =Western Australia= In 1977, Pendennis Castle was sold to Hamersley Iron, one of the largest iron ore producers in Australia, which intended to run her on its ore-carrying Hamersley railway in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The company-backed Pilbara Railways Historical Society wanted a steam locomotive, and chairman Russell Madigan had promised them one, possibly Flying Scotsman.http://www.exacteditions.com/exact/browse/545/744/4983/3/36?dps= When purchased by Hamersley Iron, Pendennis Castle was in need of considerable boiler repairs, which delayed her departure for Australia. On 29 May 1977, she made her farewell run in the UK, at the head of the Great Western Envoy from Birmingham to Didcot and return. The following day, she headed to Avonmouth, the port for Bristol, where she was loaded aboard the cargo vessel Mishref, and departed for Sydney on 2 June 1977. The Mishref arrived in Sydney on 13 July 1977, and the locomotive was unloaded in Darling Harbour. She was then towed to the Eveleigh Carriage Workshops, where she was stored pending delivery to her ultimate destination, Dampier, Western Australia. On 26 March 1978, Pendennis Castle was towed to Newcastle, New South Wales, and, together with three new GE C36-7 diesel locomotives, was loaded aboard the Iron Baron for the voyage to the Pilbara. On 29 April 1978, the locomotive was unloaded at Dampier. One week later, Hamersley Iron's Manager, Operations, Ian Burston, handed her over to the Pilbara Railways Historical Society. On 12 October 1978, Pendennis Castle and two former New South Wales Government Railways S type passenger cars were named Rio Fe (\\"River of Iron\\") by Lady Turner, wife of Sir Mark Turner, chairman of Rio Tinto - Zinc Corporation, one of the major investors in Hamersley Iron. A brass plaque bearing the name Rio Fe was fitted above the locomotive's smokebox door. Pendennis Castle's first passenger carrying journey in Western Australia was a return trip from Dampier to Dugite on 7 November 1978, with the locomotive hauling two passenger cars. Modified in 1980, Pendennis Castle was used for various other excursion trains on the company's ore-carrying railways. After further modifications, she was moved by road to Perth, where she had a historic reunion with Flying Scotsman on 17 September 1989. During the 1990s, after various difficulties and with the expiry of the boiler certificate, she made her final run on 14 October 1994.\\"Pendennis Castle to Head Home This Month\\" Railway Digest April 2000 page 19 Hamersley Iron were not prepared to pay a repair bill of 240,000 Australian Dollars, and repairs were becoming uneconomical after fully electronic signalling was installed, which would have required the locomotive to run behind a GE Transportation Systems Dash 9. This resulted in the locomotive being stored for several years. =Return to the UK= In 1999, Hamersley Iron's parent, Rio Tinto, decided to find a secure home for the locomotive, an idea conceived and executed by Adrian Lumley-Smith who at the time was on secondment from the UK to Hamersley Iron. An agreement was reached with the Great Western Society for the locomotive to be donated. It was moved by road from Dampier to Perth, before being shipped to Bristol on 24 April 2000, and ultimately the Didcot Railway Centre.\\"Pendennis Castle on its Way Home\\" Railway Digest June 2000 page 17 Restoration was started in 2005, with the original intention that a return to main line service would take place in 2008. As of the start of 2018, restoration is still ongoing. It was announced in an issue of Steam Railway magazine that plans to run Pendennis Castle on an excursion trip with preserved sister 7029 Clun Castle to commemorate the end of steam and the end of the Castle Class on the Western Region in March 1967 would not go ahead as 4079 would not be restored in time for the anniversary in 2017. It was later announced that following Didcot's decision to withdraw from running on the mainline, on completion 4079 will only be run at Didcot and on heritage railways.https://www.railadvent.co.uk/2019/12/steam- locomotive-6023-king-edward-ii-retired-from-mainline-work.html/amp Didcot ceases mainline operations Pendennis Castle shares her name with First Great Western's 57604, painted in Great Western brunswick green.

Early life  Born in 1862 in London, he was the son of one of the most powerful politicians in the Prussian Kingdom. As Foreign Minister for Prussia, his father, Count Albrecht von Bernstorff, had earned the ire of Otto von Bismarck in the Prussian constitutional crisis of 1859‚Äì1866. Overestimating his political strength, von Bernstorff resigned in a spat over the constitution with the expectation to force his will on the Prussian government. However, the Emperor accepted Bernstorff's miscalculated challenge and appointed von Bismarck chancellor and foreign minister. For the rest of his life, Count Albrecht von Bernstorff would criticise Bismarck's Machiavellian style of governing. In 1862, the elder Bernstorff served as ambassador to the Court of St James's. For the next eleven years young Bernstorff grew up in England until his father's death in 1873. After moving back to Germany Johann von Bernstorff went to the humanistic gymnasium in Dresden from which he graduated with a baccalaureate in 1881. While von Bernstorff's dream had always been to pursue a diplomatic career, the family feud with Bismarck made an appointment to the diplomatic service impossible.Heribert von Feilitzsch, In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914, Henselstone Verlag, Virginia, 2012, pp. 203‚Äì204 As a result, he joined the Prussian Army for the next eight years, serving in an artillery unit in Berlin. After being elected a member of the Reichstag, he finally succeeded in convincing the Bismarcks to settle the dispute with the long dead father. In 1887, von Bernstorff married Jeanne Luckemeyer, a German-American.NY Times 8 November 1908 She was a native of New York City and daughter of a wealthy silk merchant.\\"Bernstorff's wife again U.S. citizen,\\" The New York Times, 25 February 1939, p. 13. Career =First diplomatic postings= His first diplomatic assignment was Constantinople, where he served as military attach√©. From 1892 to 1894, he served at the German embassy in Belgrade. After a brief assignment to St. Petersburg (1895‚Äì1897), von Bernstorff was stationed in Munich for a period. He then became First Secretary of the German embassy in London (1902‚Äì1906). Bernstorff's diplomatic skills were noted in Berlin throughout the First Moroccan Crisis in 1905. He then served as consul general in Cairo (1906‚Äì1908). Despite his family's problems with the Bismarcks, von Bernstorff basically agreed with Bismarck's policies, particularly the decision to found the German Reich without Austria in 1871. As a diplomat, von Bernstorff adamantly supported Anglo-German rapprochement and considered the policies of Wilhelm II \\"reckless.\\"Johann Count von Bernstorff, Memoirs of Count Bernstorff, Random House, New York, NY, 1936. = Ambassador to the United States = Johann H. von Bernstorff, 1919 In 1908, von Bernstorff was appointed the German ambassador to the United States. He was recalled to Germany on 7 July 1914 but returned on 2 August upon the outbreak of the First World War. It was later revealed that he had been recruited into intelligence work and ordered to assist the German war effort by all means necessary. He was also provided with a large slush fund to finance those operations. He began with attempts to assist German-Americans who wished to return home to fight by forging passports to get them through the Allied blockade. Publicly, Bernstorff's ambassadorship in Washington was characterised by a diplomatic battle with the British ambassador, Sir Cecil Spring Rice, with both men attempting to influence the American government's position regarding the war.S. Gwynn, 'The Letters and Friendships of Sir Cecil Spring Rice' (Constable & Co Lt, London, 1929), 352. Later, however, as the blockade began to prevent American munitions manufacturers from trading with Germany, the ambassador began financing sabotage missions to obstruct arms shipments to Germany's enemies. Some of the plans included destroying the Welland Canal, which circumvents Niagara Falls. That was attempted in September 1914 but failed. They year, the German diplomatic mission also began supporting the expatriate Indian movement for independence. Bernstorff was assisted by Captain Franz von Papen, later a German chancellor, and Captain Karl Boy-Ed, a naval attach√©. The commercial attach√©, Heinrich Albert, was the finance officer for the sabotage operations. Papen and the German consulate in San Francisco are known to have been extensively involved in the Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy, especially in the Annie Larsen gun running plot. Although Bernstorff himself officially denied all knowledge, most accounts agree that he was intricately involved as part of the German intelligence and sabotage offensive in America against Britain. After the capture of the and confiscation of its cargo, Bernstorff made efforts to recover the $200,000 worth of arms, insisting they were meant for Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck in German East Africa. That was futile, however, and the arms were auctioned off. In December 1914, Bernstorff received a cable from the German Foreign Office that instructed him to target the Canadian railways. On 1 January 1915, the Roebling Wire and Cable plant in Trenton, New Jersey, was blown up. On 28 January, an American merchant ship carrying wheat to Britain was sunk. On 2 February 1915, Lt. Werner Horn was captured following the Vanceboro international bridge bombing. In 1916 his wife was involved in blackmail plot by a former German spy, Armgaard Karl Graves. In 1915, Bernstorff also helped organise what became known as the Great Phenol Plot, an attempt to divert phenol from the production of high explosives in the United States (which would end up being sold to the British), and at the same time prop up several German-owned chemical companies that made aspirin and its precursor, salicylic acid. In September 1915, his agents attempted to influence the negotiations between American banks and the Anglo-French Financial Commission, but failed to prevent an agreement being reached. In July 1916, the Black Tom explosion was the most spectacular of the sabotage operations. Some of Bernstorff's other activities were exposed by the British Secret Service when they obtained and distributed to the press a photograph of him \\"in a swimming costume with his arms around two similarly dressed women, neither of whom was his wife\\".MI6, The History of the Secret Intelligence Service 1909 ‚Äì 1949, Keith Jeffery, Bloomsbury, 2010. p. 113 Bernstorff was returned home on 3 February 1917, when Woodrow Wilson severed diplomatic relations with Germany after the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare. Upon receiving the news, Colonel Edward M. House wrote to him, \\"The day will come when people in Germany will see how much you have done for your country in America.\\" In 1910, Brown University had conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Bernstorff. At the school's commencement in 1918 (while World War I was going on), university president William Faunce read a resolution of the board of fellows revoking the degree, because \\"while he was Ambassador of the Imperial German Government to the United States and while the nations were still at peace, [Bernstorff] was guilty of conduct dishonorable alike in a gentleman and a diplomat.\\"Martha Mitchell, \\"Honorary degrees\\" in Encyclopedia Brunoniana (1993). = Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire = He assumed his position as ambassador to the Ottoman Empire in 1917. Bernstorff conceded that the Ottoman policy against the Armenians was one of exterminating the race. Bernstorff provided a detailed account of the massacres in his memoirs entitled, Memoirs of Count Bernstorff. In his memoirs, Bernstorff recounts a conversation that he had with Talat Pasha after the massacres were concluded: \\"When I kept on pestering him about the Armenian question, he once said with a smile: 'What on earth do you want? The question is settled, there are no more Armenians.'\\" = Weimar Republic = Bernstorff in 1930 at Geneva Bernstorff was proposed as Foreign Minister in Philipp Scheidemann's cabinet in 1919, but he refused this post and left the diplomatic service. He became a founding member of the German Democratic Party (Deutsche Demokratische Partei) and a member of the German Parliament in 1921‚Äì28. He was the first President of the German Association for the League of Nations, President of the World Federation of Associations of the League of Nations and a member of every German delegation to the League of Nations.Biography at Neue Deutsche Biographie In 1926, he became the Chairman of Kurt Blumenfeld's Zionist German Pro-Palestine Committee (Deutsches Pro- Pal√§stina Komitee) to support the foundation of a Jewish State in Palestine. From 1926 to 1931 he was the chairman of the German delegation to the Preparatory World Disarmament Conference. Bernstorff, who was explicitly mentioned by Hitler as one of those men bearing \\"the guilt and responsibility for the collapse of Germany\\", left Germany in 1933 after the Nazis rose to power and moved to Geneva, Switzerland, where he died on 6 October 1939.

Biography Anne was a daughter of Charles II of Austria and Maria Anna of Bavaria. She was the grandchild of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor and Anne of Bohemia and Hungary (1503-1547). Her mother was an important supporter of the Counter-Reformation in Inner Austria, who gave her children an upbringing focused on Catholicism. The siblings were made to attend church from the age of one, their first words were to be Jesus and Mary, they were tutored by Catholic priests and Latin was to be a priority before their native German language.Anna, urn:sbl:18720, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Hj.

As a child, Anna was called ¬ªAndle¬ª, and at she was taught to translate Ribadeneyra's ¬ªVita Ignatii Loyol√¶¬ª from Latin to German.Anna, urn:sbl:18720, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Hj.

This was in a period when Sweden was close to a Counter-Reformation under king John III and his Polish queen Catherine Jagiellon. The Pope gave his approval to the idea of a marriage alliance between Habsburg and Sweden in the persons of Anna and Sigismund, as did the Polish king and queen, and when visiting Graz in 1578, Possevino acquired a portrait of Anna to bring with him on his next visit to the Swedish court.Anna, urn:sbl:18720, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Hj. Bergstrand.), h√§mtad 2020-10-01. Soon after, however, a new proposal was made to arrange a marriage between Anna and Henry of Lorraine to prevent French expansion in Lorraine, and for a while, these plans were given priority.Anna, urn:sbl:18720, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Hj. Bergstrand.), h√§mtad 2020-10-01. In 1585, Anna accompanied her parents to the Imperial court in Vienna and Prague, unofficially to investigate a possible marriage to her cousin the emperor, but those plans did not come to fruition either. In 1586-1587, when prince Sigismund of Sweden was elected king of Poland, his maternal aunt queen Anna Jagiellon resummed the old plans of a marriage between Sigismund and Anna. Anna's parents, however, still preferred the match with Henry of Lorraine, especially because of the political instability in Poland, the oposition of chancellor Jan Zamoisky and Arch Bishop Maximilian's desire for the Polish crown.Anna, urn:sbl:18720, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Hj. Bergstrand.), h√§mtad 2020-10-01. In 1589, the Polish court acquired for Maria Anna of Bavaria instead. In 1591, however, the Emperor finally decided that a marriage to Sigismund would be the match for Anna which would best benefit the Habsburg dynasty.Anna, urn:sbl:18720, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Hj. Bergstrand.), h√§mtad 2020-10-01. Count Gustaf Brahe was sent as an envoy to Graz, other formalities were negotiated by Sigismund's favorite cardinal Georg Radziwil, and Anna, who was personally unvilling, was told to obey the Emperor's command.Anna, urn:sbl:18720, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Hj. Bergstrand.), h√§mtad 2020-10-01. In April 1592, the bethrothal was formally celebrated in the Imperial Court in Vienna; on 4 May, a proxy wedding was celebrated, after which Anna and her mother departed for the wedding in Krakow. Anne became the first wife of Sigismund of Poland on 31 May 1592. This marriage was opposed by many nobles (szlachta) of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, who were opposed to the alliance with the Austrian Habsburgs that Sigismund pursued. When Sigismund sent a diplomatic mission, led by Cardinal Radziwill, to Prague for his bride, the anti-Habsburg party with chancellor Jan Zamoyski guarded the borders to prevent the Archduchess from entering the country. Anne evaded the guards, arrived in Krak√≥w and was crowned in May 1592 by Primas Karnkowski as the Queen of Poland. Later, during her lifetime, the capital of the Commonwealth was moved from Krak√≥w to Warsaw. =Queen= Anna was described as attractive and intelligent. She acquired the confidence and love of the introvert Sigismund, and their relationship are described as a happy one, with her functioning as his support during the many trials of the politically instable 1590s.Anna, urn:sbl:18720, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Hj. Bergstrand.), h√§mtad 2020-10-01. Sigismund became king of Sweden as well in 1592, and the king and queen was required in Sweden to be crowned. The Poles did not wish to allow Sigismind to leave Poland, and in exchange for allowing him to depart, they wished to keep Anna as a hostage during the king's stay in Sweden.Anna, urn:sbl:18720, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Hj. Bergstrand.), h√§mtad 2020-10-01. Sigismund refused to agree to this demand, and they were finally able to depart for Sweden in 1593.Anna, urn:sbl:18720, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Hj. Bergstrand.), h√§mtad 2020-10-01. The sea journey to Sweden was a difficult one, which she undertook while pregnant. Queen Anne did not like Sweden, nor did she make a good impression on the Swedes: raised as a fervent Catholic, she strongly disaproved of the Protestant Swedes, whom she regarded as heretics, and could not tolerate the Lutheran clergy.Anna, urn:sbl:18720, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Hj.

She was crowned as the Queen of Sweden in Uppsala Cathedral on 19 February 1594, but because the ceremony was a Protestant one, she viewed it as an empty ceremony of no consequence.Anna, urn:sbl:18720, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Hj.

Her political influence as the confidant of Sigismund was noted, and Anne and her Jesuit confessor Sigismund Ehrenh√∂ffer acted as a channel between the king and the Papal envoy Germanico Malaspina, to whom they gave information about the kings policy.Anna, urn:sbl:18720, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Hj. Bergstrand.), h√§mtad 2020-10-01. On April 1594 in Stockholm, she gave birth to daughter, Catherine, whose baptism was elaborately celebrated at the Swedish court, but the child died soon after. The Poles had demanded that she leave her daughter Anna Maria behind her as hostage in Poland during their stay in Sweden, and she was afraid that the Swedes would demand to keep her daughter Catherine (born in Sweden) when she returned to Poland. On her departure from Sweden in July 1594, she was granted Link√∂ping, S√∂derk√∂ping and Stegeborg on the condition that she respect the Protestant belief within these feifs. Upon their return to Poland, Anne acted as the confidant of Sigismund in his policy to navigate between the Polish noble fractions, the League against the Ottoman Empire and the relationship between Poland and Habsburg. Anne was closely invested in the work to maintain the relationship between Poland and the Habsburg dynasty.Anna, urn:sbl:18720, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Hj.

She had however no interest in maintaining the personal union between Catholic Poland and Protestant Sweden, and used her influence to oppose the plans to save the Swedish inheritance of her son Wladislaus by allowing him to be sent to Sweden to be brought up a Protestant.Anna, urn:sbl:18720, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Hj.

In many jurisdictions, the International Building Code and International Residential Code govern the design of shear walls. A shear wall resists loads parallel to the plane of the wall. Collectors, also known as drag members, transfer the diaphragm shear to shear walls and other vertical elements of the seismic force resisting system. Shear walls are typically light-framed or braced wooden walls with shear panels, reinforced concrete walls, reinforced masonry walls, or steel plates. Plywood is the conventional material used in wood (timber) shear walls, but with advances in technology and modern building methods, other prefabricated options have made it possible to inject shear assemblies into narrow walls that fall at either side of an opening. Sheet steel and steel-backed shear panels in the place of structural plywood in shear walls has proved to provide stronger seismic resistance.  Structural design considerations  = Loading and failure mechanisms = Figure 1 Failure mechanisms of shear walls. (a) flexural failure, (b) horizontal shear, (c) vertical shear, (d) buckling. A shear wall is stiffer in its principal axis than it is in the other axis. It is considered as a primary structure which provides relatively stiff resistance to vertical and horizontal forces acting in its plane. Under this combined loading condition, a shear wall develops compatible axial, shear, torsional and flexural strains, resulting in a complicated internal stress distribution. In this way, loads are transferred vertically to the building's foundation. Therefore, there are four critical failure mechanisms; as shown in Figure 1\\\\. The factors determining the failure mechanism include geometry, loading, material properties, restraint, and construction. = Slenderness ratio = The slenderness ratio of a wall is defined as a function of the effective height divided by either the effective thickness or the radius of the gyration of the wall section. It is highly related to the slenderness limit that is the cut-off between elements being classed \\"slender\\" or \\"stocky\\". Slender walls are vulnerable to buckling failure modes, including Euler in-plane buckling due to axial compression, Euler out-of-plane buckling due to axial compression and lateral torsional buckling due to bending moment. In the design process, structural engineers need to consider all these failure modes to ensure that the wall design is safe under various kinds of possible loading conditions. To the tar = Coupling effect of shear walls = In actual structural systems, the shear walls may function as a coupled system instead of isolated walls depending on their arrangements and connections. Two neighboring wall panels can be considered coupled when the interface transfers longitudinal shear to resist the deformation mode. This stress arises whenever a section experiences a flexural or restrained warping stress and its magnitude is dependent on the stiffness of the coupling element. Depending on this stiffness, the performance of a coupled section will fall between that of an ideal uniform element of similar gross plan cross-section and the combined performance of the independent component parts. Another advantage of coupling is that it enhances the overall flexural stiffness dis-proportionally to shear stiffness, resulting in smaller shear deformation.  Arrangement in buildings with different functions  The location of a shear wall significantly affects the building function, such as natural ventilation and daylighting performance. The performance requirements vary for buildings of different functions. = Hotel and dormitory buildings = Figure 2 Coupled shear wall acting as the partitioning system. Hotel or dormitory buildings require many partitions, allowing insertions of shear walls. In these structures, traditional cellular construction (Figure 2) is preferred and a regular wall arrangement with transverse cross walls between rooms and longitudinal spine walls flanking a central corridor is used. = Commercial buildings = Figure 3 Shear core structure. A structure of shear walls in the center of a large building‚Äîoften encasing an elevator shaft or stairwell‚Äîform a shear core. In multi-story commercial buildings, shear walls form at least one core (Figure 3). From a building services perspective, the shear core houses communal services including stairs, lifts, toilets and service risers. Building serviceability requirements necessitates a proper arrangement of a shear core. From the structural point of view, a shear core could strengthen the building's resistance to lateral loads, i.e., wind load and seismic load, and significantly increase the building safety.  Construction methods‚Äîconcrete  Figure 4 Reinforced concrete shear wall with both horizontal and vertical reinforcement. Concrete shear walls are reinforced with both horizontal and vertical reinforcement (Figure 4). A reinforcement ratio is defined as the ratio of the gross concrete area for a section taken orthogonal to the reinforcement. Construction codes of practice define maximum and minimum amounts of reinforcement as well as the detailing of steel bars. Common construction methods for in-situ reinforced concrete walls include traditional shuttered lifts, slip form, jump form and tunnel form. = Shuttered lifts method = The traditional shuttered lifts method should be used when the total number of walls is small or the arrangement is irregular. In this method, walls are formed one story at one time together with the columns. Although it is slow, this technique may produce a premium finish quality or texture. = Slip form method = Slip forming is method of concrete placement whereby a moving form is used to create a continuous wall extrusion. This method is very efficient for well-suited structures, such as flanged and core wall systems. A very accurate wall thickness can be achieved but the surface is rough because of the abrasion of the form on the walls. = Jump form method = Jump forming, also known as climbing forming, is a method of construction whereby the walls are cast in discrete lifts. It is a stop-start process with day joints formed at each lift level. Similar to slip forming, jump forming is only efficient for structures with repetition of wall arrangement. Moreover, it is convenient for adding connections and extrusions at the floor level due to the discrete features. Nevertheless, the inclusion of day joints leaves higher chances for defects and imperfections. = Tunnel form method = Tunnel form construction uses a formwork system to cast slabs and walls as a single pour operation. It is suitable for cellular structures with regular repetition of both horizontal and vertical members. The advantage of this method is that the construction can progress vertically and horizontally at the same time, thereby increasing the integrity and stability of the structure.  Nonplanar shear walls  Due to functional requirements, the designer may choose non planar sections like C,L as opposed to the planar sections like rectangular/bar bell sections. Nonplanar sections require 3D analysis and are a research area.  Modeling techniques  Modeling techniques have been progressively updated during the last two decades, moving from linear static to nonlinear dynamic, enabling more realistic representation of global behavior, and different failure modes. Different modeling techniques shear walls span from macro models such as modified beam- column elements, to micro models such as 3D finite element models. An appropriate modeling technique should: * Be capable of predicting the inelastic response * Incorporating important materials characteristics * Simulate behavioural feature: Lap splice and Bar Slip * Represent the migration of the neutral axis * Tension stiffening * Interaction of flexure and shear actions Different models have been developed over time, including macro-models, vertical line element models, finite-element models, and multi- layer models. More recently, fiber-section beam-columns elements have become popular, as they can model most of the global response and failure modes properly, while avoiding sophistications associated with finite element models.

The first Magnum was released in March, 1990, and production of various models continued until 1993 when SGI bought MIPS Technologies. SGI cancelled the MIPS Magnum line to promote their own workstations including the entry-level SGI Indy. The early, R3000-based Magnum series ran only RISC/os, a variant of BSD Unix, but the subsequent Magnum workstations based on the Jazz architecture ran both RISC/os and Windows NT. In addition to these proprietary operating systems, both Linux and NetBSD have been ported to the Jazz-based MIPS Magnum machines. Some models of MIPS Magnum were rebadged and sold by Groupe Bull and Olivetti. In addition, headless (i.e., without a framebuffer or video card) versions were marketed as servers under the name \\"MIPS Millennium\\".  Series  Model number information. = MIPS Magnum 3000 = *Alternative model name: MIPS RC3230 *Release: March, 1990 *Initial price: $9000 USD *Bus: TURBOchannel *Maximum possible RAM: 128 MB = MIPS Magnum R4000 = *Two subtypes: The R4000 PC-50 and R4000 SC-50 *Release: April, 1992 *Initial price: $12,000.00 USD *Bus: EISA *Maximum possible RAM: 256 MB  Components  = Processors = The MIPS Magnum 3000 has a 25 or 33 MHz MIPS R3000A microprocessor. The MIPS Magnum R4000 PC-50 has a MIPS R4000PC processor with only 16 kB L1 cache (but no L2 cache), running at an external clock rate of 50 MHz (which was internally doubled in the microprocessor to 100 MHz). The MIPS Magnum R4000 SC-50 is identical to the Magnum R4000PC, but includes one megabyte of secondary cache in addition to the primary cache. = Memory = For main memory, the MIPS Magnum 3000 accepted 30-pin true-parity, 80ns SIMMs up to a maximum of 128 MB. The MIPS Magnum R4000 accepted eight 72-pin true-parity SIMMs, up to a maximum of 256 MB. = SCSI = The MIPS Magnum R4000 (both the R4000 PC-50 and R4000 SC-50) includes a single on-board SCSI bus using the on- board NCR 53c94 fast-narrow SCSI chipset. An internal cable with four 50-pin connections links internal SCSI devices, and also interfaces external SCSI devices via an endlink mounted on the rear of the case. = Ethernet = The MIPS Magnum R4000 includes an on-board SONIC Ethernet chipset and an AUI Ethernet connector mounted on the case. = Framebuffer = The video output for the Magnum R4000 consists of a proprietary framebuffer available as a custom full-length option card ‚Äî the G364 framebuffer. The G364 includes a SUN 13W3-style output (which can be converted to the more common VGA pin-out), and is capable of pixel screen resolutions of 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, or 1280x1024. Because it is a simple framebuffer, the G364 does not include any accelerated graphics functions. = Serial and Parallel I/O = The MIPS Magnum R4000 also includes two standard RS232-capable serial ports and an IBM AT-compatible parallel port. = Floppy disk = Also, the MIPS Magnum R4000 had an IBM AT-compatible floppy disk controller and a single floppy drive bay.  Historical development  The MIPS Magnum 3000 used a MIPS R3000 processor and a custom, proprietary motherboard which incorporated the TURBOchannel bus (it is noted that DEC also manufactured the DECstation line of workstations running Ultrix, which also used MIPS processors and the TURBOchannel bus). The Magnum 3000 ran only RISC/os, which was MIPS Computer Systems, Inc.'s proprietary port of BSD Unix including some System V features. The later Magnums, the MIPS Magnum R4000PC and MIPS Magnum R4000SC, also used a MIPS microprocessor ‚Äî the MIPS R4000, a full 64-bit microprocessor available either in a low-cost version (the R4000PC) having 16 kB of L1 cache but no L2 cache, or a higher-performance version (the R4000SC) with 1 MB of secondary cache in addition to the 16 kB of primary cache. As MIPS Computer Systems, Inc. had co- founded the Advanced Computing Environment consortium with Silicon Graphics, Microsoft, Motorola and others, the MIPS Magnum R4000 was intended to be MIPS' entry into the Windows NT workstation market. However, because MIPS Computer Systems, Inc.'s in-house effort to design a MIPS-based Windows NT system had met delays, MIPS Technologies abandoned its in-house efforts and instead licensed the Jazz design which Microsoft had developed in the early 1990s to facilitate the porting and development of Windows NT (it was first developed on the MIPS architecture, and was only later ported to the Intel 386, Alpha, and PowerPC architectures). As such, the MIPS Magnum R4000 (and indeed all Jazz-based systems, such as the Acer PICA, NEC RISCstation, Olivetti M700, etc.) incorporated many features more common to Intel-based PC's than to the commercial UNIX workstations of the era ‚Äî for example, the Magnum R4000 included an EISA bus, used IBM PS/2-compatible keyboards and mice, and used commodity chipset components whose control registers were mapped to memory locations set forth in the IBM AT standard.  Operating Systems  The MIPS Magnum R4000 ran either Windows NT (beginning with version 3.1) when equipped with the little-endian ARC firmware, or RISC/os when MIPS Computer Systems, Inc.'s proprietary big-endian firmware (the \\"MIPS Monitor\\") was installed. The firmware could be switched between ARC or MIPS Monitor by loading either one into the Magnum's Flash memory/NVRAM from floppy disk, and thus the Magnum R4000 could dual-boot between Windows or Unix. = Windows NT = The MIPS Magnum R4000 was supported by Windows NT from version 3.1 (released in 1993) through version 4.0 (released in 1996). However, support by Microsoft for all MIPS systems ended after the release of Windows NT version 4.0, and useful software for Windows/MIPS ‚Äî either from Microsoft or third-party vendors ‚Äî was very scarce even when MIPS was supported (for example, Microsoft never ported its own Microsoft Office suite to MIPS). The MIPS Magnum 3000, unlike the MIPS Magnum R4000, was not able to run Windows NT. = RISC/os = All Magnums could run RISC/os, MIPS Computer System, Inc.'s proprietary port of UNIX. Running RISC/os on the MIPS Magnum R4000 requires use of the big-endian MIPS Monitor firmware. = BSD = The MIPS Magnum can run NetBSD, and it also ran OpenBSD at one point, but lack of developer interest and proper resources lead to the termination of the arch's support prior to the December 1, 1998 2.4 release. For the earlier, RISC/os-only MIPS Magnum 3000 machines, the correct port is NetBSD/mipsco. For the later, Windows NT-capable MIPS Magnum R4000, the correct port is NetBSD/arc. = Linux = The MIPS Magnum R4000 was among the earliest supported machines in the effort to port the Linux kernel to MIPS, with initial support begun April, 1995. Support for the Magnum R4000 became stable in the 2.1 development tree (around 1999); however, support for the Magnum in Linux has atrophied since then. = QEMU = The QEMU PC emulator version 0.9.1 can emulate the MIPS Magnum (and Acer Pica 61) using the \\"-M\\" parameter (\\"-M magnum\\" or \\"-M pica61\\").

It formed part of the King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the Carrick Roads waterway at the mouth of the River Fal. The original, circular keep and gun platform was expanded at the end of the century to cope with the increasing Spanish threat, with a ring of extensive stone ramparts and bastions built around the older castle. Pendennis saw service during the English Civil War, when it was held by the Royalists, and was only taken by Parliament after a long siege in 1646. It survived the interregnum and Charles II renovated the fortress after his restoration to the throne in 1660. Ongoing concerns about a possible French invasion resulted in Pendennis's defences being modernised and upgraded in the 1730s and again during the 1790s; during the Napoleonic Wars, the castle held up to 48 guns. In the 1880s and 1890s an electrically operated minefield was laid across the River Fal, operated from Pendennis and St Mawes, and new, quick-firing guns were installed to support these defences. The castle saw service during both the First and Second World Wars, but in 1956, by now obsolete, it was decommissioned. It passed into the control of the Ministry of Works, who cleared away many of the more modern military buildings and opened the site to visitors. In the 21st century, the castle is managed by English Heritage as a tourist attraction, receiving 74,230 visitors in 2011‚Äì12. The heritage agency Historic England considers Pendennis to be \\"one of the finest examples of a post-medieval defensive promontory fort in the country\\". History =16th‚Äì17th centuries= Construction Pendennis Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely.; Basic defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale. In 1533, Henry broke with Pope Paul III in order to annul the long-standing marriage to his wife, Catherine of Aragon and remarry. Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, and he took the annulment as a personal insult.; This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England.; An invasion of England appeared certain.; In response, Henry issued an order, called a \\"device\\", in 1539, giving instructions for the \\"defence of the realm in time of invasion\\" and the construction of forts along the English coastline.; The stretch of water known as Carrick Roads at the mouth of the River Fal was an important anchorage serving shipping arriving from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.; A small gun tower, called the Little Dennis Blockhouse, was built in 1539 overlooking the entrance, and plans were made to protect the anchorage further with five additional castles.; In the event, only two of these were constructed, Pendennis and St Mawes Castle, positioned on each side of Carrick Roads and able to provide overlapping fire across the water. John Killigrew, a prominent member of the local Cornish gentry, probably oversaw the construction of Pendennis; it was built on his land and he was appointed as its first captain. Pendennis Castle cost ¬£5,614 to construct. Initial operation Tudor gun crew in action in the keep The Killigrews controlled the castle for several decades, with John Killigrew's son and grandson continuing in turn as the captain there until 1605. The captains of Pendennis frequently argued with those of St Mawes and in 1630 a legal dispute broke out about the rights to search and detain incoming shipping: both castles argued that they had a traditional right to do so.; The Admiralty eventually issued a compromise, proposing that the castles share the searching of the traffic. Meanwhile, a lasting peace with France was made in 1558 and the initial invasion threat passed. The Spanish threat to the south-west of England became more serious, however, and war broke out in 1569.; As a result, a defensive earthwork was constructed north-west of the castle to protect it against an attack from the land, and an additional gun battery facing upriver was installed alongside the blockhouse. The levels of the garrison varied considerably during the period.; Pendennis had a garrison of 100 men in 1578, and could have mustered around 500 men in 1596, while in 1599 it was reportedly guarded by 200 soldiers. The Spanish threat continued; raiding parties destroyed the Killigrews' family home at Arwenack in 1593, and four Spanish ships attacked the towns along the coast in 1595.; In 1597 a Spanish fleet with 20,000 men set out to assault Pendennis and invade England, only being prevented from landing by bad weather. The failed attack caused considerable concern inside government and the Privy Council were informed that the castle was not sufficient to prevent a Spanish landing along the coast.; A subsequent review carried out by Sir Nicholas Parker, Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Ferdinando Gorges recommended that the castle's defences should be significantly extended. The military engineer Paul Ive constructed an Italian-styled ring of earthworks, embrasures, bastions and a stone- revetted ditch around the original Henrician castle between 1597 and 1600, using a team of 400 local workers, costing around ¬£80 a week in wages.; ; In the early 1600s England was at peace and Pendennis was neglected; reportedly the garrison's pay was two years in arrears, forcing them to gather limpets from the shoreline for food.; Nonetheless, a new Italian-styled gatehouse was added to the castle, probably in 1611. War with Spain broke out again 1624 and a new defensive line, with bastions and artillery, was built across the peninsula in 1627. English Civil War and Restoration The classically styled gatehouse, built in 1700 When civil war broke out in 1642 between King Charles I and Parliament, Pendennis and the south-west of England were held by the Royalists. The growing town of Falmouth was a strategically important part of their supply route to the Continent, while Carrick Roads formed a base for Royalist piracy in the English Channel. As the war turned in favour of the Parliamentarians, preparations were made for Prince Charles to shelter there over the winter of 1645‚Äì46, as part of which the surrounding fortifications were improved; in the event, Charles stayed in the castle only briefly in early 1646. Shortly after Charles left Pendennis for the Isles of Scilly on 2 March, Thomas Fairfax entered Cornwall with a substantial army. Almost all the other Royalist positions in England had by now fallen and St Mawes Castle surrendered immediately as Fairfax approached. Pendennis Castle, however, continued to hold out, defended by around 1,000 soldiers under the command of Sir John Arundell. They were determined to hold out against the besiegers and Arundell announced that he would die rather than surrender.; Two Parliamentary colonels, Fortescue and Hammond, directed the bombardment of the castle from the land, while Captain Batten, with a flotilla of ten ships, blockaded it by sea, preventing fresh supplies from arriving.; The garrison's defences were supported with artillery fire from a Royalist warship that was deliberately run aground north of the castle to produce an additional gun platform. By July, food had begun to run short and some of the garrison unsuccessfully attempted to break out by sea to acquire supplies.; Arundell agreed to an honourable surrender on 15 August, and around 900 survivors left the fort two days later, some terminally ill from malnutrition.; Pendennis was the penultimate Royalist fortification to hold out in the war. Parliament maintained a garrison at the castle, but in 1647 it cut the levels of the armed forces across the country; most soldiers who lost their posts were offered two months pay, but at Pendennis only one month's pay was offered. The garrison, led by Colonel Richard Fortescue, mutinied, seized the visiting Parliamentary commissioners and refused to leave the castle until the additional pay was granted to them. Fearing a wider uprising, Parliament negotiated an end to the confrontation, paying off the garrison in full and offering Fortescue fresh employment elsewhere. A smaller, more reliable garrison was then installed. During the interregnum, the castle was used to imprison the radical pamphleteer William Prynne. Just before the restoration of King Charles II to the throne in 1660, the Royalist Sir Peter Killigrew became the new captain of the castle. Fears of an invasion continued, and an additional gun battery was constructed at Crab Quay, to the south-east of the main fortification. At the end of the century, a new guard barracks and gate were constructed, probably emulating those being constructed in France. =18th‚Äì19th centuries= Early 20th-century barracks Pendennis Castle continued in use through the 18th and 19th centuries under the command of successive captains, still operating in partnership with St Mawes. In 1714, Colonel Christian Lilly carried out an inspection of the fortification, finding it to be \\"in a very precarious condition\\" and noting that \\"the body of the fort having been for many years neglected is now is in a very ruinous condition\\". The parapets had collapsed, the ramparts could easily be scaled and the ditches were filled with brambles. Little was done to remedy this, however, until the 1730s, when the castle was extensively modernised. The interior was redesigned, the ramparts were rebuilt and the castle's guns were replaced, incorporating new 18-pounder cannons. During the American Revolutionary War, France allied itself with the revolutionaries, causing war with Britain to break out in 1778. The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars followed, during which period Falmouth became an important military depot. In 1795, the Crown purchased the castle's land from the Killigrew family, and reinforced the fortress to deal with the fresh threat of invasion.; ; The government installed more guns and built a new gun position called the Half-Moon Battery just outside the 16th-century walls; the landward defences of Pendennis were reinforced, and a new barracks and other ancillary buildings were built inside the fortress.; At its peak, the castle was equipped with up to 48 artillery pieces. A new volunteer unit of artillery was formed in Falmouth to support the forts around the harbour, many of them carrying out training using Pendennis's guns before then deploying elsewhere across Cornwall. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Pendennis was neglected; many of its guns became unserviceable and some buildings fell into ruin. The old post of captain of Pendennis Castle was abolished in 1837, with the fortification commanded by a conventional military appointment. In the 1850s, renewed fears of a French invasion led to investment in new artillery at the castle, and nineteen 32- and 56-pounder (14.5 and 24.5 kg) guns were installed. Falmouth continued to be an important harbour, particularly for the Royal Navy. When new concerns about France emerged, an electronically operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from Pendennis and St Mawes.; New 6- and 12-pounder (2.7 and 5.4 kg) quick-firing guns, supported by machine-guns for close defence, were assigned to the castle to deal with the emerging threat from enemy torpedo boats. =20th‚Äì21st centuries= 6-inch (152 mm) Mark 24 gun in the Half Moon Battery, dating from the Second World War The 105th Regiment Royal Garrison Artillery took over the manning of Pendennis Castle in 1902. A new barracks was built to house them, and a signal station was constructed on top of the old keep to coordinate operations with shipping, while the 16th-century guardhouse alongside the keep was demolished. The castle was reinforced by territorial soldiers during the First World War and additional defences were constructed on the landward side. It continued to defend the harbour and was also used for training purposes. After the war, Pendennis continued to be used for training gunners, but its 16th-century buildings were placed into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works in 1920, and by 1939 the fortification's artillery had all been removed.; ; Falmouth Conservation, p. 15 The castle was rearmed at the beginning of the Second World War.; Twin 6-pounder guns and longer range artillery were installed, zig-zag trenches dug for protection, and new buildings added across the site. The 16th-century fort was used as the headquarters of Falmouth Fire Command, which managed the artillery across the area. New radar-controlled, 6-inch (152 mm) Mark 24 guns followed in 1943. Falmouth played an important role in supporting the D-Day invasion of France in 1944, and during the preparations for the invasion, the gun batteries at Pendennis were used to defend against German E-boats. After the war, Pendennis was initially still used for training, but the castle was now obsolete and it was decommissioned in 1956.; The whole of the Pendennis site was placed in the guardianship of the Ministry of Works and opened to visitors; the Ministry focused its attention on the 16th-century castle and many of the more modern buildings were destroyed. The barracks were used as a youth hostel between 1963 and 2000. The heritage agency English Heritage took over control of the castle in 1984, and placed a greater priority on the conservation of its more modern features. Extensive work was carried out across the castle in the 1990s to refurbish the fortifications and open new facilities for visitors, accompanied by archaeological surveys and excavations; in the 2000s, the sergeant's mess and the custodian's house were converted into holiday cottages.; In the 21st century, the castle is managed by English Heritage as a tourist attraction, receiving 74,230 visitors in 2011‚Äì12. It is protected under UK law as a grade I listed building and as a scheduled monument.; Architecture Plan of the castle; A ‚Äì Pig's Pound Bastion; B ‚Äì Horse Pool Bastion; C ‚Äì Half-Moon Battery and tunnel; D ‚Äì practice battery; E ‚Äì Henrician castle; F ‚Äì gatehouse, guard barracks, sergeants's mess and stores; G ‚Äì Smithwick's Bastion; H ‚Äì Bell Bastion and One-Gun battery; I ‚Äì field train shed; J ‚Äì barracks; K ‚Äì East Bastion; L -Carrick Mount Bastion; M ‚Äì Little Dennis Blockhouse; N ‚Äì Crab Quay Battery Pendennis Castle is located at the end of a peninsula, overlooking Carrick Roads and the sea. It includes the original 16th-century Device Fort, surrounded by a ring of outer defences, based on the Elizabethan ramparts and later adapted during the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Further gun batteries and a blockhouse are located closer to the shore. The heritage agency Historic England considers Pendennis to be \\"one of the finest examples of a post-medieval defensive promontory fort in the country\\", demonstrating a long history of different defensive approaches, and English Heritage describes the site as \\"one of the finest surviving examples of a coast fortress in England\\".; =Ramparts= The gatehouse to the castle is located on the western side of the ramparts and dates from around 1700. It has a classical facade, with a mid-19th century stone bridge reaching across the external ditch. The ramparts are built from stone with protective ditches, and have angular bastions to provide overlapping fire, an innovative design in England when they were first constructed in 1600.; North of the gatehouse are the Smithwick and Carrick Mount bastions, the latter holding a quick-firing gun battery from 1903. Further around the ramparts, the East Bastion also has two emplacements for quick-firing guns, dating from 1902, and underground magazines, which were converted into a battery plotting room in the Second World War. Just to the south, the Nine-Gun Battery was built in the 1730s and comprises a fixed line of nine gun embrasures. In the south-east corner of the ramparts is the One-Gun Battery, which originally held a \\"disappearing gun\\", designed to pivot back under a steel shield when fired. Built in 1895, the approach proved unsuccessful and the gun was removed in 1913, but the emplacement still remains and is a rare survival of this type of weapon.; The Bell Bastion, the Ravelin, the Pig's Pound Bastion and the Horse Pool Bastion protect the southern and western parts of the ramparts. A range of artillery and anti-aircraft guns are on show around the defences, including 19th-century carronades, and 20th-century pieces such as a 155 mm (6.1 in) Long Tom field gun, a Quick Firing 3-inch 20 cwt (76 mm 102 kg) anti-aircraft gun and two Ordnance Quick-Firing 25-pounder (11 kg) howitzers. =Inner castle= Ground floor plan of the Henrician castle; A ‚Äì bridge; B ‚Äì living room; C ‚Äì kitchen; D ‚Äì garrison room; E ‚Äì gun platform At the heart of the castle is the 16th- century Henrician fortification. Built of a combination of granite ashlar and rubble, it comprises a circular keep surrounded by a gun platform, entered through a bridge and a forebuilding.; The keep has thick walls and on in the inside is octagonal. The basement was originally a kitchen, cellar and larder for the castle. The ground floor was initially designed to be a gun room, complete with gun embrasures, but was altered during the initial construction project to form living accommodation for the garrison instead. Another gun room occupies the first floor, with seven gun embrasures, and is dressed to appear as it would have done in the 16th century. The roof has seven gun embrasures and a lookout turret. The polygonal gun platform around the keep has 16 sides, with a total of 14 gun embrasures.; The two-storey forebuilding dates from the second half of the 16th century, with three rooms on each level linked by a spiral-staircase, and was originally used to house the captain of the castle.; Its entrance was guarded with a portcullis, and the roof was designed to be defendable with handguns. The stone bridge that stretches across the ditch that protects the castle dates from 1902; it would originally have been protected at the front by a rectangular gatehouse, but this was demolished at the start of the 20th century. The rest of the interior of the fortress was, at various times, occupied by a range of different military buildings, but they have mostly been demolished and grassed over to form a large parade ground. Among the surviving buildings are the Royal Garrison Artillery barracks, located to the north of the parade ground. Built between 1900 and 1902, it could hold 140 soldiers in 12 man barrack-rooms. Alongside the barracks are bungalows, originally for the use of senior non-commissioned officers, a storehouse dating from the Napoleonic Wars, and two guard barracks from 1700, which form a very early example of this form of military architecture in England.; Other buildings that have survived include a 19th- century field train shed, and an 18th-century gunpowder magazine, since converted into a shelter for gunners. =External defences= Little Dennis Blockhouse Three defensive positions are positioned outside the main ramparts of the castle. To the south, reached by an underground passage, is the Half- Moon Battery, constructed in 1793 and redesigned in 1895 and 1941. This has two camouflaged gun houses and 6-inch guns dating from the Second World War, when it held a team of 99 soldiers. Further south, near the waterline, is the Little Dennis Blockhouse, a D-shaped gun position dating from 1539, altered in the 1540s and then adapted to form part of a larger fortification covering the whole of Pendennis Point in the late 16th century. Built from Killas rubble, the exterior of the blockhouse and its lookout turret still survive intact.; Just along the shoreline to the north-east is the Crab Quay Battery, a set of defences originating in the 16th century, intended to prevent an amphibious landing on the headland, and modernised extensively in 1902.

It extends the N1 national road through the Du Toitskloof mountains that separate Paarl from Worcester, providing a route that is safer, faster (between 15 and 26 minutes) and shorter (by 11 km) than the old Du Toitskloof Pass travelling over the mountain. History View of new road into Huguenot Tunnel An idea for a tunnel through the Du Toitskloof Mountains was conceived in the 1930s but was put on hold due to the outbreak of World War Two. The idea developed into a pass over the mountains, the Du Toitskloof pass, using the labour of Italian prisoners of war between 1942 and 1945 and continued with ordinary labour until its completion in 1948. Geological surveys and design started in 1973, and excavation followed in 1984, tunneling from both ends using drilling and blasting. Construction There were two phases to the tunneling, the first a pilot tunnel to examine the routes geographical obstacles. The second phase bored a 5 m tunnel through granite rock as well as the construction of portals, drainage and ventilation tunnels. The two drilling heads met with an error of only 3 mm over its entire 3.9 km length. The tunnel was finally opened on 18 March 1988. The tunnel is maintained by Tolcon, a subsidiary of the Murray & Roberts construction company. The tunnel was constructed by Hochtief Construction AG and Concor Holdings. Current plans Currently the tunnel carries one lane of traffic in each direction. Plans are underway to open a second unfinished tunnel, the \\"northern bore\\", to carry eastbound traffic. This will allow for two lanes of traffic in each direction, with each tunnel carrying traffic in one direction only. In 2002, traffic peaks occurred during Easter (a record on 26 April 18 200 vehicles) and the December school holidays (12 000 vehicles per day).

In 2006 she portrayed the role of The Queen Mother in the Stephen Frears movie The Queen, about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the few days after that, leading up to the funeral. She remains active in films, television and theatre. Personal life Syms was born in Woolwich, London, England, the daughter of Daisy (n√©e Hale) and Edwin Syms, a trade unionist and civil servant.Sylvia Syms Biography (1934‚Äì) She grew up in Well Hall, Eltham\\"Well Hall\\" entry of London Gazetteer by Russ Willey, (Chambers 2006) (online extract ) and was educated at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, on whose council she later served. Her daughter Beatie Edney is also an actress, and she is the aunt of musicians Nick and Alex Webb. Career In her second film, My Teenage Daughter (1954), she played Anna Neagle's troubled daughter. In 1958, she starred in the film Ice Cold in Alex (alongside John Mills, Anthony Quayle and Harry Andrews); that same year she appeared in the English Civil War film, The Moonraker. In 1959 she played in Expresso Bongo with Cliff Richard. She played opposite Dirk Bogarde in 1961 in the film Victim, as the wife of a barrister who is a closet homosexual. The film was thought to have broadened the debate which led to the decriminalisation of homosexual acts in private. In 1962, she played Tony Hancock's wife in The Punch and Judy Man. The film also featured her nephew, Nick Webb. Other comedies followed, such as The Big Job (1965) with Hancock's former co-star Sid James and Bat Out of Hell (1967), but it was for drama that she won acclaim, including The Tamarind Seed (1974) with Julie Andrews and Omar Sharif, for which she was nominated for a British Film Academy award. My Good Woman in 1972 was a husband-and-wife television comedy series which ran until 1974 with Leslie Crowther. At the same time, she was one of two team captains on the BBC's weekly Movie Quiz, hosted by Robin Ray. In 1975, she was the head of the jury at the 25th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1989, Syms appeared in the Doctor Who story \\"Ghost Light\\". Shortly after the end of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's period of office in 1990, Syms portrayed her in Thatcher: The Final Days (1991), a Granada television film for ITV, which dramatises the events surrounding her removal from power. She later recreated the role on the stage. From 2000‚Äì03, she played Marion Riley in the ITV comedy-drama series At Home with the Braithwaites and in 2002, she featured in the serial The Jury and contributed \\"Sonnet 142\\" to the compilation album When Love Speaks. For Stephen Frears' The Queen (2006), she was cast in the role of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother with Dame Helen Mirren who, as her daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, won an Oscar for her performance. She also appeared in The Poseidon Adventure (2005), an American TV film with a negligible connection to the 1972 feature film. She has also taken up producing and directing. In 2009, she appeared in the film Is Anybody There? alongside Michael Caine and Anne-Marie Duff and in the ITV1 drama series Collision. In 2010, she guest-starred as a patient in BBC One's drama series Casualty, having played a different character in an episode from 2007. Syms also appeared as another character in Casualty's sister series Holby City in 2003. Since 2007, Syms has had a recurring role in BBC One's EastEnders, playing dressmaker Olive Woodhouse. Her most recent appearance in the role was on 20 July 2010. In 2010, Syms took part in the BBC's The Young Ones, a series in which six celebrities in their 70s and 80s attempted to overcome some of the problems of ageing by harking back to the 1970s. From 2013 to 2019, Syms was the narrator of Talking Pictures, which aired on BBC Two.

The term \\"Higher and Further Mathematics\\", and the term \\"Advanced Level Mathematics\\", may also refer to any of several advanced mathematics courses at many institutions. In the United Kingdom, Further Mathematics describes a course studied in addition to the standard mathematics AS-Level and A-Level courses. In the state of Victoria in Australia, it describes a course delivered as part of the Victorian Certificate of Education (see ¬ß Australia (Victoria) for a more detailed explanation). Globally, it describes a course studied in addition to GCE AS-Level and A-Level Mathematics, or one which is delivered as part of the International Baccalaureate Diploma. United Kingdom =Background= A qualification in Further Mathematics involves studying both pure and applied modules. Whilst the pure modules (formerly known as Pure 4-6 or Core 4-6, now known as Further Pure 1-3, where 4 exists for the AQA board) build on knowledge from the core mathematics modules, the applied modules may start from first principles. To achieve an A level in Further Maths, candidates must study six modules which have not already been used for their Maths A level. These six modules must consist of FP1, at least one of FP2 or FP3, and 4 other modules. With regard to Mathematics degrees, most universities do not require Further Mathematics, and may incorporate foundation math modules or offer \\"catch-up\\" classes covering any additional content. Exceptions are the University of Warwick, the University of Cambridge which requires Further Mathematics to at least AS level; University College London requires or recommends an A2 in Further Maths for its maths courses; Imperial College requires an A in A level Further Maths, while other universities may recommend it or may promise lower offers in return. Some schools and colleges may not offer Further mathematics, but online resources are available Although the subject has about 60% of its cohort obtaining \\"A\\" grades, students choosing the subject are assumed to be more proficient in mathematics, and there is much more overlap of topics compared to base mathematics courses at A level. Some medicine courses do not count maths and further maths as separate subjects for the purposes of making offers. This is due to the overlap in content, and the potentially narrow education a candidate with maths, further maths and just one other subject may have. = Support = There are numerous sources of support for both teachers and students. The AMSP (formerly FMSP) is a government-funded organisation that offers professional development, enrichment activities and is a source of additional materials via its website. Registering with AMSP gives access to Integral, another source of both teaching and learning materials hosted by Mathematics Education Innovation (MEI). Underground Mathematics is another resource in active development which reflects the emphasis on problem solving and reasoning in the UK curriculum. A collection of tasks for post-16 mathematics can be also found on the NRICH site. Australia (Victoria) In contrast with other Further Mathematics courses, Further Maths as part of the VCE is the easiest level of mathematics. Any student wishing to undertake tertiary studies in areas such as Science, Engineering, Commerce, Economics and some Information Technology courses must undertake one or both of the other two VCE maths subjects‚Äî Mathematical Methods or Specialist Mathematics. The Further Mathematics syllabus in VCE consists of three core modules, which all students undertake, plus two modules chosen by the student (or usually by the school or teacher) from a list of four. The core modules are Univariate Data, Bivariate Data, Time Series, Number Patterns and Business-Related Mathematics. The optional modules are Geometry and Trigonometry, Graphs and Relations, Networks and Decision Mathematics, or Matrices. Singapore Further Mathematics is available as a second and higher mathematics course at A Level (now H2), in addition to the Mathematics course at A Level. Students can pursue this subject if they have A2 and better in 'O' Level Mathematics and Additional Mathematics, depending on the school. Some topics covered in this course include mathematical induction, complex number, polar curve and conic sections, differential equations, recurrent equations, matrices and linear spaces, numerical methods, random variables and hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. International Baccalaureate Diploma Further Mathematics, as studied within the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, is a Higher Level (HL) course that can be taken in conjunction with Mathematics HL or on its own. It consists of studying all four of the options in Mathematics HL, plus two additional topics. Topics studied in Further Mathematics include: *Topic 1 - Linear algebra - studies on matrices, vector spaces, linear and geometric transformations *Topic 2 - Geometry - closer look on triangles, circles and conic sections *Topic 3 - Statistics and probability - the geometric and negative binomial distributions, unbiased estimators, statistical hypothesis testing and an introduction to bivariate distributions *Topic 4 - Sets, relations and groups - algebra of sets, ordered pairs, binary operations and group homomorphism *Topic 5 - Calculus - infinite sequences and series, limits, improper integrals and various first-order ordinary differential equations *Topic 6 - Discrete mathematics - complete mathematical induction, linear Diophantine equations, Fermat's little theorem, route inspection problem and recurrence relations (Note: this course has been discontinued)  India  CBSE does not include any 'further' mathematics courses.

Over 80% of the residents of South Lawndale are of Mexican descent and the community is also home to the largest foreign-born Mexican population in all of Chicago. It is notable for having two well-known neighborhoods, Little Village and Marshall Square.  Neighborhoods  = Little Village = Little Village, often referred to as the \\"Mexico of the Midwest,\\" is a dense community in the western and central areas of South Lawndale, with a major commercial district along 26th Street. The area was originally settled by Eastern European and Czech and Bohemian immigrants in the late 19th century, after the Great Chicago Fire sent the population of Chicago rippling out from the city's center to the outlying countryside. Jobs created by industrial development in the early 20th century also attracted residents to the area. Little Village saw a marked increase in Polish immigrants in the mid-20th century. Mexican and Chicano residents were pushed into the area by the mid-1960s due to segregationist policies in the city of Chicago. As African American residents were pushed into East Garfield Park and North Lawndale communities, this \\"forced Chicanos/Mexicanos south into Little Village\\" and the neighboring community of Pilsen. Scholar Juan C. Guerra notes that \\"the contiguous communities of Pilsen and Little Village merged and emerged as the newest and largest Mexican neighborhood in Chicago.\\" Little Village celebrates Mexican Independence Day every September with a parade down 26th Street. It is the largest Hispanic parade in Chicago. The Parade attracts thousands of spectators each year who flock to the neighborhood to show support and pride for their heritage.Gellman, Erik. \\"Little Village\\". In Keating, Ann Durkin, ed. (2008). Chicago Neighborhoods and Suburbs: A Historical Guide, p. 198. University of Chicago Press. Little Village also boasts its economic power in Chicago. Little Village's 26th Street is the second highest grossing shopping district in the city. In 2015, the 2 mile street created $900 million in sales. Its contender, Michigan Avenue, made approximately $1.8 billion that same year. For green spaces and recreation in Little Village, residents can make a visit to the community parks. Washtenaw Park has a baseball diamond and offers a variety of arts and crafts classes for adults as well as day camps for kids. Shedd Park is a little park in Little Village named for John G. Shedd (known to most Chicagoans as the founder of the Shedd Aquarium). Piotrowski Park is the neighborhood's largest public park and is the most popular outdoor retreat for Little Village residents. Famous past residents of Little Village include former Mayor Anton Cermak, who lived in the 2300 block of S. Millard Avenue, across the street from Lazaro Cardenas Elementary. Pat Sajak was also a Little Village resident. He attended Gary Elementary School and Farragut High School. The bulk of Little Village falls within the aldermanic boundaries of the 22nd Ward, represented by Ricardo Mu√±oz.http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/about/wards/22.html In 2011, a music festival called Villapalooza was founded to promote non-violent spaces for arts, culture, and community engagement. This festival has been held yearly and has grown into one of Chicago's most popular and diverse grassroots music festivals drawing both local and international musicians. The festival is free and open to the public. On August 26, 2018, a fire began early that morning in Little Village. The fire killed ten children, including six children under the age of 12. Investigators stated that the fire started in the back of the building in a ground-floor apartment, which was vacant. The fire was the deadliest residential fire to have occurred in Chicago since 1958. In the aftermath of the fire, multiple violations were found in the apartment where the fire occurred with apartment owner, Merced Gutierrez, appearing in court for the 40 violations found at the site of the fire. On April 11, 2020, the city of Chicago allowed for the implosion of an old smokestack at the Crawford Coal plant in Little Village carried out by Hilco Redevelopment Partners which sent a large cloud of dust particles into the neighborhood. This sparked outrage and plans for a class action lawsuit. As reported by Mauricio Pe√±a, community activists in Little Village had called upon mayor Lori Lightfoot to stop the implosion before it was carried out, concerned with exposing residents to asbestos and lead, especially during the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic. = Marshall Square = Marshall Square is a neighborhood name that is being used by real estate investors, but not the actual residents. It is in the northeast corner of the South Lawndale Community Area, named for the square formed by Marshall Boulevard, 24th Boulevard, Cermak Road, and California Avenue.

The film stars Hilary and Haylie Duff, Anjelica Huston, Lukas Haas, Maria Conchita Alonzo, and Brent Spiner. It is co-produced by Patriot Pictures and Maverick Films. Plot Sisters Tanzania \\"Tanzie\\" and Ava are wealthy, spoiled Hollywood socialites who enjoy material things such as shopping and dating, rather than caring about the family cosmetics company, which was founded by their late father, Victor Marchetta. Marchetta Cosmetics is run by co-founder and family friend Tommy Katzenbach. Tanzie plans to go to college in the future and Ava is planning to announce her engagement with fianc√© Mic. When a major media scandal involving the Marchetta night cream causing disfigurement breaks, the girls and their father's reputation is destroyed, and Ava and Tanzie retreat to their mansion. The girls prepare a homemade spa and Tanzie accidentally spills nail polish remover. Ava lights a cigarette and when an argument breaks out between the sisters, the dropped cigarette accidentally starts a fire. Ava saves her father's watch and her engagement party dress while Tanzie saves their TiVo box which had recordings of her father talking about his cosmetics. They leave for a hotel but soon learn all their credit cards have been shut down, leaving the girls completely broke. They move in with their maid and close family friend Inez in her small apartment. There, their car gets stolen by two men whom they naively mistook for valets. The next morning, Ava and Tanzie take a bus, get off at the wrong stop and have to walk the rest of the way to Ava's engagement party. They are refused entry and when their friend Etienne ignores them, the girls realize that their friends only liked them for their money. Ava's fianc√© Mic gets his agent Sol to dump her, saying that she is now a \\"liability\\". Tommy plans to persuade the board of directors to sell Marchetta Cosmetics to their archrival Fabiella for $60 million (or $30 million apiece). The girls are resigned to the fact that their company will be sold to Fabiella and are given 30 days until the stockholders meeting, when the deal will be made official. While the deal means the girls will be able to return to their extravagant lifestyles, they are nonetheless depressed over their father's legacy being destroyed. After Tanzie's love interest and the company's lab technician Rick helps them evade the press outside, Ava and Tanzie decide to become \\"private investigators\\" and approach free legal clinic lawyer Henry for help. He agrees, after initially refusing to help them as they are not \\"underprivileged\\". Determined to restore their father's reputation and the company he left as his legacy, the sisters are determined to expose the truth. While watching the news, Tanzie notices a woman that looks familiar. She rewatches a news broadcast on her TiVo and recognizes a woman who accused Marchetta of leaving her disfigured, was also featured in an eczema documentary on KLAE. Tanzie goes to the KLAE offices dressed provocatively and flirts with the receptionist, who allows her access to the file room. She manages to obtain the woman's address, before being arrested and put in jail for fraud and trespassing. Ava has to pawn her dad's Rolex (her most treasured possession) to pay Tanzie's bail money after Henry helps her realize that family is more important than material things. The woman, Margo Thorness, claims that Marchetta paid for her cosmetic surgery for the damage caused by Marchetta Everdew night cream, but Ava and Tanzie learn from her neighbor that she has lied since she was born with a skin disease. The girls meet with the board of directors and successfully manage to clear the Marchetta name, by revealing that Tommy (their father's best friend and trustee of the company) was behind the scandal, as he had helped fabricate testimonials, and used money taken from the sisters' personal bank accounts. Tommy is promptly fired by Ava. Six months later, the girls are running the company, with Ava as the new CEO and Tanzie studying while working as a chemist. Ava is now in a relationship with Henry, and Tanzie is now in a relationship with Rick.

His nicknames \\"Bull\\" or \\"Bull Head\\" came both from his great booming voice and a legend that a musket ball once bounced off his head. Sumner fought in the Black Hawk War, with distinction in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, on the Western frontier, and in the Eastern Theater for the first half of the Civil War. He led the II Corps of the Army of the Potomac through the Peninsula Campaign, the Seven Days Battles, and the Maryland Campaign, and the Right Grand Division of the Army during the Battle of Fredericksburg. He died in March 1863 while awaiting transfer. Early life and career Sumner was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Elisha Sumner and Nancy Vose Sumner. His early schooling was in Milton Academy in Milton, Massachusetts. He was a first cousin once removed of Charles Sumner, the abolitionist, and a distant cousin of the statesman, Increase Sumner, and his son, the historian William H. Sumner. In 1819, after losing interest in a mercantile career in Troy, New York, he entered the United States Army as a second lieutenant in the 2nd US Infantry Regiment on March 3, 1819. He was promoted to first lieutenant on January 25, 1825. Sumner's military appointment was facilitated by Samuel Appleton Storrow, Judge Advocate Major on the staff of General Jacob Jennings Brown of the Northern department. (Storrow had previously served as a mentor to Sumner in Boston.) In recognition of their long-standing friendship, Sumner would later name one of his sons Samuel Storrow Sumner.The Sumner‚ÄìStorrow relationship is discussed in unpublished 19th-century correspondence of the Storrow family (copies of which are held by descendants). The Storrow‚ÄìBrown relationship is described in Morris. He married Hannah Wickersham Foster (1804‚Äì1880) on March 31, 1822. They had six children together: Nancy, Margaret Foster, Sarah Montgomery, Mary Heron, Edwin Vose Jr., and Samuel Storrow Sumner. His son Samuel was a general during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Boxer Rebellion, and the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Sumner's daughter, Mary Heron, married General Armistead L. Long in 1860. Sumner later served in the Black Hawk War and in various Indian campaigns. On March 4, 1833, he was promoted to the rank of captain and assigned to command B Company, the U.S. Dragoon Regiment (later First US Dragoons), immediately upon its creation by Congress. In 1838, he commanded the cavalry instructional establishment at Carlisle Barracks in Pennsylvania. He was assigned to Ft. Atkinson, Iowa Territory, from 1842 until 1845. He was the fort's commander during most of that period. He was promoted to major of the 2nd Dragoons on June 30, 1846. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Sumner was brevetted for bravery at the Battle of Cerro Gordo (to lieutenant colonel). It was here that he gained the nickname \\"Bull Head\\" because of a story about a musket ball that bounced off his head during the battle. At the Molino del Rey he received the brevet rank of colonel. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 1st US Dragoons on July 23, 1848. He served as the military governor of the New Mexico Territory from 1851‚Äì53 and was promoted to colonel of the 1st U.S. Cavalry on March 3, 1855. In 1856 Sumner commanded Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and became involved in the crisis known as Bleeding Kansas. In 1857, as commander of the 1st Cavalry Regiment (1855), he led a punitive expedition against the Cheyenne,Bertbrong, pp. 133‚Äì40; Grinnell, pp. 111‚Äì21. and in 1858 he commanded the Department of the West. On January 7, 1861, Sumner wrote to President-elect Abraham Lincoln, advising him to carry a weapon at all times. Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott assigned Sumner as the senior officer to accompany Lincoln from Springfield, Illinois, to Washington, D.C., in March 1861. Civil War In February 1861, Brig. Gen. David E. Twiggs was dismissed from the Army for treason by outgoing U.S. President James Buchanan, and on May 12, 1861, Sumner was nominated by the newly inaugurated Lincoln to replace Twiggs as one of only three brigadier generals in the regular army, with date of rank March 16.. The two other line- officer brigadier generals in the regular army as of May 1861 were John Wool and William S. Harney; Joseph E. Johnston, Quartermaster General of the Army, resigned on April 22 to join the Confederate States Army. Sumner was thus the first new Union general created by the secession crisis. He was then sent to replace Brig. Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, then in command of the Department of the Pacific in California, and thus took no part in the 1861 campaigns of the war. When Sumner left for California, his son-in-law Armistead Lindsay Long resigned his commission and enlisted with the Confederate Army eventually becoming Robert E. Lee's military secretary and an artillery brigadier general. An image of Sumner by Mathew Brady or Levin C. Handy In November 1861, Sumner was brought back east to command a division. When Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan began organizing the Army of the Potomac in March, Sumner was given command of one of its new corps. McClellan had not originally formed corps within the Army; Sumner was selected as one of four corps commanders by President Lincoln, based on his seniority. The II Corps, commanded during the war by Sumner, Darius N. Couch, Winfield Scott Hancock, and Andrew A. Humphreys, had the deserved reputation of being one of the best in the Eastern Theater. Sumner, who was the oldest of the generals in the Army of the Potomac, led his corps throughout the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days Battles. 300px McClellan originally formed a poor opinion of Sumner during the Battle of Williamsburg on May 5, 1862. During McClellan's absence, Sumner directed the inconclusive battle, which failed to impede the Confederate withdrawal up the Peninsula, and McClellan wrote to his wife, \\"Sumner had proved that he was even a greater fool than I had supposed & had come within an ace of having us defeated.\\" At the Battle of Seven Pines, however, Sumner's initiative in sending reinforcing troops across the dangerously rain-swollen Chickahominy River prevented a Union disaster. He received the brevet of major general in the regular army for his gallantry at Seven Pines. Sumner was struck in the arm and hand by spent balls at the Battle of Glendale. Despite his old-fashioned ideas on discipline and respect for commanding officers, the II Corps troops generally had a positive opinion of him. Sumner was promoted to major general of volunteers on July 4, 1862, with the rank dated to May 5. In the fall of 1862, at the Battle of Antietam, Sumner was the center of controversy for ordering Brig. Gen. John Sedgwick's division to launch an attack into the West Woods on the morning of the battle. The assault was devastated by a Confederate counterattack, and Sedgwick's men retreated in great disorder to their starting point with over 2,200 casualties. Sumner has been condemned by most historians for his \\"reckless\\" attack, his lack of coordination with the other corps commanders, accompanying Sedgwick's division personally and losing control of his other attacking division, failing to perform adequate reconnaissance prior to launching his attack, and selecting an unusual line of battle formation that was so effectively flanked by the Confederate counterattack. Historian M. V. Armstrong's recent scholarship, however, has determined that Sumner did perform appropriate reconnaissance and his decision to attack where he did was justified by the information available to him. Sumner's other divisions drove the weak Confederate center back, but Sumner was badly shaken by the disaster to Sedgwick and heavy casualties to other Union forces. Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin wanted to attack with his fresh VI Corps, but Sumner, who was senior to him, ordered him to hold back. McClellan sustained Sumner. Shortly before being fired from command of the army in October, McClellan wrote to the War Department a letter recommending that Sumner be relieved of duty, as he doubted that his age and health would permit him to survive another campaign, but nothing came of this and when Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside succeeded to the command of the Army of the Potomac, he grouped the corps in \\"grand divisions\\" and appointed Sumner to command the Right Grand Division. In this capacity, he took part in the disastrous Battle of Fredericksburg, in which the II Corps, now commanded by Major General Darius N. Couch, suffered heavy casualties in frontal assaults against Confederate troops fortified at Marye's Heights. =Transfer and Death= Oakwood Cemetery, Syracuse, New York Soon afterward, on Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's appointment to command the Army of the Potomac on January 26, 1863, Sumner was relieved of his command at his own request, apparently disillusioned with the quarreling in the army and also thoroughly exhausted. He was then reassigned to a new command in the Department of the Ohio, effective in the spring.Hitchcock, Frederick L., 132nd Pennsylvania, \\"War from the Inside.\\" 1904, Chapter XI Before that, Sumner went to his daughter's home in Syracuse, New York, to rest, where he fell ill with fever. He died on March 21, 1863 and was buried in Syracuse's Oakwood Cemetery. His two sons, Brigadier General Edwin Vose Sumner, Jr. and Major General Samuel S. Sumner, both served in the Civil War and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Grave Sumner is buried in Section 8, Lot 1 of Oakwood Cemetery in Syracuse. Part of the Teall family plot, the gravesite has some structural problems and issues of disrepair. The Onondaga County Civil War Round Table was raising funds to repair the grave and the general area. See also * List of American Civil War generals (Union) Notes References Bertbrong, Donald J.

Family connections to Philip II of Macedon Attalus was born in Lower Macedonia in 390 BC. In 338 BC, Attalus's adopted niece Cleopatra Eurydice married king Philip II of Macedonia. It is said that at the wedding, Attalus made a prayer that Cleopatra may give birth to a legitimate male heir to Philip. This was seen as a direct insult to Alexander the Great. In the spring of 336 BC, Philip II appointed Attalus and Parmenion as commanders of the advance force that would invade the Persian Empire in Asia Minor. Revenge-rape of Pausanias of Orestis According to a story of Aristotle's, lengthened by Cleitarchus and Diodorus Siculus, Attalus sexually assaulted Pausanias of Orestis in retribution for besmirching the reputation of Attalus' friend (possibly relation), also named Pausanias, an event that led to the death of Pausanias, the beloved of Attalus, while attempting to prove his honour after public humiliation by Pausanias of Orestis. Philip II of Macedon's later assassination by Pausanias of Orestis has been tied to this affair as Pausanias of Orestis was upset that Phillip had not punished Attalus. Execution by Alexander After Philip II had been assassinated and Alexander became king (October 336 BC), his stepmother Cleopatra Eurydice and her two children were all killed (Cleopatra Eurydice may have died by her own hand after the murders of her children). At the time of the assassination of Phillip and accession of Alexander the Great to the Macedonian throne, Attalus was stationed with Parmenion and the Macedonian advance army in Asia Minor. In the wake of Phillip II's death, it is alleged by hostile sources that Demosthenes of Athens wrote a letter to Attalus promising Athens' support if the two made war on Alexander. Attalus submitted Demosthenes' letters to Alexander and pledged his support to the king. Despite Attalus attempting to appease him, Alexander had sent an officer to Asia Minor either kill or arrest Attalus. Even without the resentment between the two men that had occurred after the marriage of Cleopatra Eurydice, Alexander probably felt Attalus was too ambitious and popular with the Asian forces to remain alive, and would have good reason for revenge after the deaths of Cleopatra Eurydice and her children. Attalus was executed in 336 BC. In popular media *In the 1956 Richard Burton film Alexander the Great, he was played by Stanley Baker. *In the 1990 and 1991 historical fiction books Lion of Macedon and Dark Prince by David Gemmell.

A series of nearly identical machines were also sold by NEC in headless (i.e., no video card or framebuffer) configuration as the RISCserver series, and were intended for use as Windows NT workgroup servers. Historical development The RISCstations were based on a modified Jazz architecture licensed from MIPS Computer Systems, Inc. (and which was originally designed by Microsoft). Although architecturally similar to contemporaneous Intel 80386-based personal computers (including, for example, a PCI bus), the RISCstations were faster than the Pentium-based workstations of the time. Although based on the Jazz design, the RISCstations did not use the G364 framebuffer, instead using a S3 968-based video card or a 3Dlabs GLiNT-based adapter in a PCI slot. Form factor All RISCstations used a standard IBM AT-style tower or minitower case, a motherboard which also met the AT form factor standard, and PCI peripherals (such as the video card) for peripheral expansion. Operating systems Several operating systems supported RISCstations. Like all Jazz-based MIPS computers (such as the MIPS Magnum), the RISCstations ran the ARC console firmware to boot Windows NT in little-endian mode. The MIPS III architecture was capable of either little- endian or big-endian operation. However, Microsoft stopped supporting the MIPS architecture in Windows NT after version 4.0. RISCstations ceased production in 1996. In addition to Windows NT, NEC ported a version of Unix System V to the RISCstation. Although support is lacking from Linux/MIPS for the RISCstation series, they are supported by NetBSD as NetBSD/arc and had been supported by OpenBSD, prior to the termination of the port in 1998. Models The RISCstation line included: *RISCStation Image - Acer PICA OEM *RISCstation 2000 **Dual-processor SMP system with two 150 MHz MIPS R4400 microprocessors **PCI **NCR53C700 SCSI *RISCstation 2200 **Single-processor system with a MIPS R4400 microprocessor *RISCstation 2250 *RISCstation 4400 **Dual-processor SMP system with two 250 MHz MIPS R4400 microprocessors Pricing In March, 1995, a dual-CPU configuration of the RISCStation 2000 was priced at about $14,000, and came equipped with two 150 MHz MIPS R4400 CPUs, 64 MB of RAM, a 1 GB SCSI hard drive, a 3x CD-ROM drive and a 17-inch NEC-brand CRT monitor.

The group PSL(2, C) of 2 by 2 complex matrices of determinant 1 modulo its center has several natural representations: as conformal transformations of the Riemann sphere, and as orientation-preserving isometries of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space H3, and as orientation preserving conformal maps of the open unit ball B3 in R3 to itself. Therefore, a Kleinian group can be regarded as a discrete subgroup acting on one of these spaces. History The theory of general Kleinian groups was founded by and , who named them after Felix Klein. The special case of Schottky groups had been studied a few years earlier, in 1877, by Schottky. Definitions By considering the ball's boundary, a Kleinian group can also be defined as a subgroup Œì of PGL(2,C), the complex projective linear group, which acts by M√∂bius transformations on the Riemann sphere. Classically, a Kleinian group was required to act properly discontinuously on a non-empty open subset of the Riemann sphere, but modern usage allows any discrete subgroup. When Œì is isomorphic to the fundamental group \\\\pi_1 of a hyperbolic 3-manifold, then the quotient space H3/Œì becomes a Kleinian model of the manifold. Many authors use the terms Kleinian model and Kleinian group interchangeably, letting the one stand for the other. Discreteness implies points in B3 have finite stabilizers, and discrete orbits under the group Œì. But the orbit Œìp of a point p will typically accumulate on the boundary of the closed ball \\\\bar{B}^3. An Apollonian gasket is an example of a limit set of a Kleinian group The boundary of the closed ball is called the sphere at infinity, and is denoted S^2_\\\\infty. The set of accumulation points of Œìp in S^2_\\\\infty is called the limit set of Œì, and usually denoted \\\\Lambda(\\\\Gamma). The complement \\\\Omega(\\\\Gamma)=S^2_\\\\infty - \\\\Lambda(\\\\Gamma) is called the domain of discontinuity or the ordinary set or the regular set. Ahlfors' finiteness theorem implies that if the group is finitely generated then \\\\Omega(\\\\Gamma)/\\\\Gamma is a Riemann surface orbifold of finite type. The unit ball B3 with its conformal structure is the Poincar√© model of hyperbolic 3-space. When we think of it metrically, with metric : ds^2= \\\\frac{4 \\\\, \\\\left dx \\\\right^2 }{\\\\left( 1-x^2 \\\\right)^2} it is a model of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space H3. The set of conformal self-maps of B3 becomes the set of isometries (i.e. distance-preserving maps) of H3 under this identification. Such maps restrict to conformal self-maps of S^2_\\\\infty, which are M√∂bius transformations. There are isomorphisms : \\\\operatorname{Mob}(S^2_\\\\infty) \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Conf}(B^3) \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Isom}(\\\\mathbf{H}^3). The subgroups of these groups consisting of orientation-preserving transformations are all isomorphic to the projective matrix group: PSL(2,C) via the usual identification of the unit sphere with the complex projective line P1(C). =Variations= There are some variations of the definition of a Kleinian group: sometimes Kleinian groups are allowed to be subgroups of PSL(2, C).2 (PSL(2, C) extended by complex conjugations), in other words to have orientation reversing elements, and sometimes they are assumed to be finitely generated, and sometimes they are required to act properly discontinuously on a non-empty open subset of the Riemann sphere. Types *A Kleinian group is said to be of finite type if its region of discontinuity has a finite number of orbits of components under the group action, and the quotient of each component by its stabilizer is a compact Riemann surface with finitely many points removed, and the covering is ramified at finitely many points. *A Kleinian group is called finitely generated if it has a finite number of generators. The Ahlfors finiteness theorem says that such a group is of finite type. *A Kleinian group Œì has finite covolume if H3/Œì has finite volume. Any Kleinian group of finite covolume is finitely generated. *A Kleinian group is called geometrically finite if it has a fundamental polyhedron (in hyperbolic 3-space) with finitely many sides. Ahlfors showed that if the limit set is not the whole Riemann sphere then it has measure 0. *A Kleinian group Œì is called arithmetic if it is commensurable with the group norm 1 elements of an order of quaternion algebra A ramified at all real places over a number field k with exactly one complex place. Arithmetic Kleinian groups have finite covolume. *A Kleinian group Œì is called cocompact if H3/Œì is compact, or equivalently SL(2, C)/Œì is compact. Cocompact Kleinian groups have finite covolume. *A Kleinian group is called topologically tame if it is finitely generated and its hyperbolic manifold is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact manifold with boundary. *A Kleinian group is called geometrically tame if its ends are either geometrically finite or simply degenerate . *A Kleinian group is said to be of type 1 if the limit set is the whole Riemann sphere, and of type 2 otherwise. Examples =Bianchi groups= A Bianchi group is a Kleinian group of the form PSL(2, Od), where \\\\mathcal{O}_d is the ring of integers of the imaginary quadratic field \\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{-d}) for d a positive square- free integer. =Elementary and reducible Kleinian groups= A Kleinian group is called elementary if its limit set is finite, in which case the limit set has 0, 1, or 2 points. Examples of elementary Kleinian groups include finite Kleinian groups (with empty limit set) and infinite cyclic Kleinian groups. A Kleinian group is called reducible if all elements have a common fixed point on the Riemann sphere. Reducible Kleinian groups are elementary, but some elementary finite Kleinian groups are not reducible. =Fuchsian groups= Any Fuchsian group (a discrete subgroup of SL(2, R)) is a Kleinian group, and conversely any Kleinian group preserving the real line (in its action on the Riemann sphere) is a Fuchsian group. More generally, every Kleinian group preserving a circle or straight line in the Riemann sphere is conjugate to a Fuchsian group. =Koebe groups= *A factor of a Kleinian group G is a subgroup H maximal subject to the following properties: **H has a simply connected invariant component D **A conjugate of an element h of H by a conformal bijection is parabolic or elliptic if and only if h is. **Any parabolic element of G fixing a boundary point of D is in H. *A Kleinian group is called a Koebe group if all its factors are elementary or Fuchsian. =Quasi-Fuchsian groups= Limit set of a quasifuchsian group A Kleinian group that preserves a Jordan curve is called a quasi-Fuchsian group. When the Jordan curve is a circle or a straight line these are just conjugate to Fuchsian groups under conformal transformations. Finitely generated quasi- Fuchsian groups are conjugate to Fuchsian groups under quasi-conformal transformations. The limit set is contained in the invariant Jordan curve, and it is equal to the Jordan curve the group is said to be of type one, and otherwise it is said to be of type 2. =Schottky groups= Let Ci be the boundary circles of a finite collection of disjoint closed disks. The group generated by inversion in each circle has limit set a Cantor set, and the quotient H3/G is a mirror orbifold with underlying space a ball. It is double covered by a handlebody; the corresponding index 2 subgroup is a Kleinian group called a Schottky group. =Crystallographic groups= Let T be a periodic tessellation of hyperbolic 3-space. The group of symmetries of the tessellation is a Kleinian group. =Fundamental groups of hyperbolic 3-manifolds= The fundamental group of any oriented hyperbolic 3-manifold is a Kleinian group. There are many examples of these, such as the complement of a figure 8 knot or the Seifert‚ÄìWeber space. Conversely if a Kleinian group has no nontrivial torsion elements then it is the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold. =Degenerate Kleinian groups= A Kleinian group is called degenerate if it is not elementary and its limit set is simply connected. Such groups can be constructed by taking a suitable limit of quasi- Fuchsian groups such that one of the two components of the regular points contracts down to the empty set; these groups are called singly degenerate. If both components of the regular set contract down to the empty set, then the limit set becomes a space-filling curve and the group is called doubly degenerate. The existence of degenerate Kleinian groups was first shown indirectly by , and the first explicit example was found by J√∏rgensen. gave examples of doubly degenerate groups and space-filling curves associated to pseudo-Anosov maps.

PubChem Compound Database; CID=3314, https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3314 (accessed 26 Feb. 2019). It is a colorless to pale yellow, aromatic oily liquid extracted from certain essential oils especially from clove oil, nutmeg, cinnamon, basil and bay leaf.Yield and Oil Composition of 38 Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) Accessions Grown in Mississippi It is present in concentrations of 80‚Äì90% in clove bud oil and at 82‚Äì88% in clove leaf oil. Eugenol has a pleasant, spicy, clove-like scent. The name is derived from Eugenia caryophyllata, the former Linnean nomenclature term for cloves. (The currently accepted name is Syzygium aromaticum.)  Modern uses  Eugenol is used in perfumes, flavorings, and essential oils. It is also used as a local antiseptic and anaesthetic. Eugenol can be combined with zinc oxide to form zinc oxide eugenol which has restorative and prosthodontic applications in dentistry. For persons with a dry socket as a complication of tooth extraction, packing the dry socket with a eugenol-zinc oxide paste on iodoform gauze is effective for reducing acute pain. Eugenol-zinc oxide paste is also used for root canal sealing. It is one of many compounds that is attractive to males of various species of orchid bees, which apparently gather the chemical to synthesize pheromones; it is commonly used as bait to attract and collect these bees for study. It also attracts female cucumber beetles. It was recently discovered that eugenol and isoeugenol, floral volatile scent compounds, are catalyzed by a single type of enzyme in the genus Gymnadenia and the gene encoding for this enzyme is the first functionally characterized gene in these species so far. Clove oil is growing in popularity as an anaesthetic for use on aquarium fish as well as on wild fish when sampled for research and management purposes. Where readily available, it presents a humane method to euthanise sick and diseased fish either by direct overdose or to induce sleep before an overdose of eugenol. Biosynthesis The biosynthesis of eugenol begins with the amino acid tyrosine. L-tyrosine is converted to p-coumaric acid by the enzyme tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL). From here, p-coumaric acid is converted to caffeic acid by p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase using oxygen and NADPH. S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) is then used to methylate caffeic acid, forming ferulic acid, which is in turn converted to feruloyl-CoA by the enzyme 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA ligase (4CL). Next, feruloyl-CoA is reduced to coniferaldehyde by cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR). Coniferaldeyhyde is then further reduced to coniferyl alcohol by cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) or sinapyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (SAD). Coniferyl alcohol is then converted to an ester in the presence of the substrate CH3COSCoA, forming coniferyl acetate. Finally, coniferyl acetate is converted to eugenol via the enzyme eugenol synthase 1 and the use of NADPH. Biosynthesis of eugenol Bioactivity and toxicity Eugenol and thymol were found to possess general anesthetic properties. Like many other anesthetic agents, these 2-alkyl(oxy)phenols were found to act as positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor. Although eugenol and thymol are too toxic and not potent enough to use clinically, these findings led to the development of 2-substituted phenol anesthetic drugs, including propanidid (later withdrawn) and the widely used propofol. Eugenol is hepatotoxic, meaning it may cause damage to the liver. Overdose is possible, causing a wide range of symptoms from blood in the patient's urine, to convulsions, diarrhoea, nausea, unconsciousness, dizziness, or rapid heartbeat. According to a published 1993 report, a 2-year-old boy nearly died after taking between 5 and 10 ml. Allergy Eugenol is subject to restrictions on its use in perfumery as some people may become sensitised to it, however, the degree to which eugenol can cause an allergic reaction in humans is disputed. Eugenol is a component of balsam of Peru, to which some people are allergic. When eugenol is used in dental preparations such as surgical pastes, dental packing, and dental cement, it may cause contact stomatitis and allergic cheilitis. The allergy can be discovered via a patch test.  Natural occurrence  Eugenol naturally occurs in several plants, including the following: * Cloves (Syzygium aromaticum) * Wormwood * Cinnamon * Cinnamomum tamala * Nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) * Ocimum basilicum (sweet basil) * Ocimum gratissimum (African basil) * Ocimum tenuiflorum (syn.

A froe (or frow), shake axe or paling knife is a tool for cleaving wood by splitting it along the grain. It is an L-shaped tool, used by hammering one edge of its blade into the end of a piece of wood in the direction of the grain, then twisting the blade in the wood by rotating the haft (handle). A froe uses the haft as a lever to multiply the force upon the blade, allowing wood to be torn apart with remarkably little force applied to the haft. By twisting one way or the other the direction of the split may be guided.Froes, Hank Allen, The Tool Shed #90, Journal of Tool Collecting, Crafts, New Jersey, 1996 Overview Froes are used in combination with mallets to split timber, to make planks, wooden shingles, or kindling; they are safer and more accurate to use than hatchets or splitting mauls because the blade is not swung. The origin of the word froe is not clear, and some references find it spelled frow. One possibility of its roots can be found in the Old English word , which meant \\"away\\", which was the direction you hammered the froe to split the wood.One Hundred Years of Roofing in America, National Roofing Contractors Association, Rosemont, Illinois, 1986 Froes are similar in general form to axes, in that a froe is an L-shaped assembly of a blade head (typically steel) set at a right angle to a handle called a haft (traditionally wood). A froe can be thought of as an axe which is sharpened along the top of a long, narrow, rectangular head, instead of (as the axe is) at the end of a broad curved head. Some froes are made of a single piece of metal with no perpendicular haft. Instead, the handle is the unbeveled end of the blade which extends directly from the blade. These froes must be hammered through the entire piece of wood, as their lack of vertical haft makes it extremely difficult to lever the wood apart.The Woodwright's Guide: Working Wood With Wedge and Edge, section on Froes, Roy Underhill, University of North Carolina, 2008 A given froe can split a piece of wood no wider in its narrowest dimension than the length of the froe's blade; that is, when you place the froe, it must cross the surface of the wood completely. A froe is also unlike an axe or maul in that the froe can be placed exactly where the user would like the split to begin. With the exception of users with expert aim, axes and mauls cannot. This technique can be used with enough precision that regularity of measurements can be kept when cutting shingles, ground stakes, or even small rails or planks. Another use is to rive pieces of wood to be used for steam bending, as this wood follows the grain and is less prone to breakage. Hitting the narrow blade of a froe repeatedly soon damages a mallet, and so the traditional implement used to hit it is a froe club. This is simply a short length of a thin log, still with the bark on it, with one end reduced with a drawknife to convenient diameter for a handle. It is rotated slightly in the hand with each blow so as to even the wear and, although the club soon wears out, a new one can easily be made.

It had an aim to represent the needs and views of younger LGBT people by campaigning for greater visibility and equal rights, as well as providing general support and information to those who are just coming out or who are experiencing homophobia.  Founding  Queer Youth Network members from London and the South East marching down Whitehall as part of Pride London 2011. Founded in 1999 by David Joseph Henry and CN Lester as a grass roots civil rights group, its formation was inspired by YouthSpeak and originally called the 'Queer Youth Alliance' until December 2006, and also 'Queer Youth Overground' for a short period between 1999 and 2001. In the beginning, the movement consisted of two member groupsQueer Youth Manchester (a local social support group based at the Hollywood Showbar in Manchester's gay village) and Putney High School's Gay Straight Alliance (the first of its kind in the UK). Henry and Lester got together to form a national alliance of LGBT Young People. As many of the organisation's original aims began to be achieved (e.g. abolition of Section 28 and equalising the age of consent for gay men), the group decided to focus on youth support, and representation to ensure homophobic legislation such as that brought about by the Conservative government of the 1980s should not be re-enacted. The first president of the organisation was David Joseph Henry, who stepped down in August 2005 to make way for new president Greg Justice, with Katherine Parlour taking over as Vice President. With the departure of Greg Justice and Katherine Parlour, the organisation re-grouped; after a period of no clear control in 2007, the organisation changed its name to the Queer Youth Network, and with David Henry, Michael Bundock and Damian Griffiths appointed as the Network's trustees. The site and organisation has recently undergone a face- lift incorporating many features personal to individual members, core policy development and streamlined to ease confusion amongst some of the volunteer teams known as \\"volunqueers\\". The organisation has been awarded the accolade as \\"Youth Group of the Year\\" by Pink Paper readers in both 2009 and 2010. The network's leaders were absolutely thrilled to have been voted \\"Best Youth Group\\" by Pink Paper readers and in response explained that 2009 will mark the 10th Anniversary of Britain's first national organisation for LGBT young people. The leaders also acknowledged that the award is a testament to all the members, volunteers and supporters who have worked hard to support the wellbeing of queer young people by campaigning for equality and liberation.  Core work  Instrumental in overturning Kent County Council's 'mini-Section 28' policy after a long campaign, the Network is known for its vibrant, rowdy protests and youth-led campaigns. The organisation is one of the growing number of groups in Britain to have reservations about the Government's new 'Civil partnerships' bill that aims to give equal rights to same sex couples. The Queer Youth Network is campaigning for the legalisation of marriage for same sex couples and as a result the organisation is one of the founding members of the Coalition for Marriage Equality (UK) together with OutRage! and the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement. The organisation is a member of the Education for All coalition led by Stonewall set up to tackle homophobic bullying 3. Leader David Joseph Henry has been outspoken and controversial when speaking on the issue and has accused the British education system as being an \\"inherently flawed fossil directly responsible for rising rates of suicide in young men, record number of children on anti-depressant drugs, spiraling anti-social behaviour in particular 'youth on youth' crime including bullying activities\\". The group's Scottish wing recently hit the headlines during a clash with Transport giant Stagecoach, that accused QYN of a 'Slur' as it mounted a Boycott on its bus services following revelations of institutional homophobia.2. QYN also runs the UK's only national transgender youth organisation to work with young people both under and over the age of 18, Trans Youth Network. After a brief period of inactivity, Queer Youth Network returned to campaigning in August 2007, with the appointment of Jack Holroyde as \\"Campaigns Officer\\" and Jo McKillop as Trans Officer. Recent campaigns have included much work on transgender rights for young people, and the appointment of a new asexuality co-ordinator. Letter to Metropolitan Police regarding Pride 2008: by Joanne McKillop (Trans Officer) After it was announced a controversial journalist (Julie Bindel) had been nominated for a Stonewall Book Award the organisation issued a statement claiming it was \\"Concerned and Disappointed\\". Recent campaigns have included calling for action on homophobic and transphobic hate crime, in particular the murder of Michael Causer in Liverpool. LGBT youth activists wants action after death of teen following homophobic attack 5 August 2008 Gay Teen Murdered in Liverpool: LGBT Youth Groups Demand Action 8 June 2008. The organisation has also been involved in a number of controversial events surrounding Manchester Pride after calling for the annual LGBT festival to be a free event. Leader David Joseph Henry claimed festival stewards attempted to censored their \\"Pride Not Profit\\" placards.Queer Group claims organisers tried to censor them at Manchester Pride 28 August 2008. They later released a short film called \\"Manchester Shame\\" exploring arguments that Pride is no longer a community event. Shortly after the Chair of the Village Business Association, Phil Burke resigned from the board of Manchester Pride declaring \\"Manchester Pride purely a money-making operation\\" and is \\"run by dictators\\".Manchester Pride: Purely a \\"commercial operation\\" Leading figures in the Network are active in politics. David Henry stood as a parliamentary candidate in the 2010 General Election against former minister Hazel Blears. Jack Holroyde stood down from his position in QYN to join the Liberal Democrats and is now a leading activist in north London. Jo McKillop stood down shortly after they returned to education in 2010, and has since been active as Trans Officer for the LGBTQ+ Society at University of Roehampton, where they spearheaded a joined-up approach to trans support and inclusion and pushed for registry reform; finally winning the creation of a Trans Officer post on the SU Council in 2017. National Queer Youth Conference Queer Youth Alliance at Manchester EuroPride 2003 with gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell The National Queer Youth Conference is hosted annually by the Queer Youth Network, in 2003 it took place in London, 2004 saw it come to Birmingham, Manchester in 2005 and to Birmingham again in 2007. The event is the largest gathering of LGBT young people in Europe and is based upon similar events held in the United States.  Regional work  'Local Reps' lead 7 regional QYN Groups throughout England. The organisation is also responsible for the formation of a national voice for LGBT young people in Wales: LGBT Youth Wales. In Scotland it works closely with LGBT Youth Scotland, and GLYNI (Gay and Lesbian Youth Northern Ireland) who are affiliated member groups of which there are now over 200. Queer Youth London is one of the movement's most active groups and has been run by Hollie Brock for several years. As a fully youth-led collective, it holds regular monthly meets all over Greater London and the South East. International branches of the network have also appeared in recent years including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and a Pan-African network. In Europe there are also groups covering the Benelux nations and Scandinavia.  Queer Youth Radio  The Queer Youth Network launched Queer Youth Radio in the summer of 2006. Shows are put together by the group's members and youth groups across the UK who are invited to produce and star in their very own radio programmes. The station broadcasts a blend of new music and news as well as having its own Soap Opera called 'The Group'. Which follows the goings on at a gay youth group and tackles funny issues along with not so funny ones. The newest addition is Sandra, Queer Youth's very own drag queen who spins the decks with her uplifting tunes and sometimes coarse humour.  Website issues  After the domain wasn't renewed for a week, the site returned with major issues.http://www.lgbtyouth.org/ Users could not sign in or sign up. The news feed was broken and pages could not be viewed without signing in. However, a tweet from the Twitter account stated that the website is being redone for 2015 for a \\"new generation\\". It appears that the company behind the QYN site has been dissolved and lack of information and activity on social media indicates that the organisation is no longer operating.

He made numerous guest appearances on television shows, including The Addams Family, The Jack Benny Program, I Love Lucy, The Real McCoys, Alice, and Sanford and Son. He also provided voices for animated series such as The Flintstones, Mister Magoo, The Jetsons, Dinky Dog, and The Snorks.  Life and career  Nelson began his entertainment career in radio, and later moved into television and movies. In 1926, at age 15, Nelson played the role of a 30-year-old man in a radio series broadcast from the then-5,000-watt KOA (AM) radio station serving the Denver, Colorado market. In 1929, Nelson moved to Hollywood, California and worked in local radio dramatic shows, usually playing the leading man. The first sponsored radio show he appeared in to reach a national market was Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel, a situation comedy radio show that aired from November 28, 1932, to May 22, 1933, starring two of the Marx Brothers, Groucho and Chico, and written primarily by Nat Perrin and Arthur Sheekman. =Work with Jack Benny= Nelson first found fame as the put-upon foil to Jack Benny on Benny's radio show during the 1940s and 1950s. Nelson began to appear on Benny's radio show in the late 1930s,Leff, Laura (2004): 39 Forever - Volume 1: Radio May 1932 - May 1942. p. 326. doing various roles, but his eventual character began to take form around 1942.Leff, Laura (2004): 39 Forever - Volume 1: Radio May 1932 - May 1942. p. 492. Nelson, whose character was never given a name,Josefsberg, Milt (1977): The Jack Benny Show. New Rochelle: Arlington House. p. 113. typically portrayed a sales clerk, dentist or customer service worker, and Benny's character would run into him seemingly out of nowhere. For example, needing airline tickets, Benny would call the ticket agent, \\"Oh Mister? Mister?\\" Nelson would then deliver his catchphrase, a bellowed \\"EEE-Yeeeeeeeeesssss?\\" The two men would banter, with Nelson gleefully delivering insulting one-liners such as, \\"Is that a hairpiece or did someone plant moss on your head?\\", and sarcastic responses like, after being asked at an airport ticket counter if he was the ticket clerk, \\"No, I'm a 747 with a moustache.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q0AAvx8ppo Whatever his occupation in a particular episode, Nelson's character would usually be polite and patient with all of his customers except for Jack Benny. An especially noteworthy example occurred on the episode that aired Jan. 8, 1950. Early in the show, announcer Don Wilson mispronounced columnist Drew Pearson's name as \\"Poo Drearson,\\" which got a big laugh. The writers made a quick change to the script, and later, when Benny approached Nelson and asked if he were the doorman, the latter replied, \\"Well, who do you think I am in this uniform? Poo Drearson?\\" Benny, who collapsed in laughter (as did the audience), later cited it as one of the longest laughs ever on his show. Nelson also appeared on Benny's television show beginning in 1950, doing the same \\"rude clerk\\" shtick. His other catchphrase, that would be worked into every routine, would have Benny asking something mundane, such as, \\"Do these shirts come in a medium?\\", and Frank would bellow, \\"Oo-oo-oo-ooh, DO they!\\" Nelson's sudden appearances usually led to spontaneous laughter or applause on the part of the audience. =Other work= Nelson performed on a number of Hollywood-based radio shows during this time, including Fibber McGee and Molly, and did radio work well into the late 1950s, on the few shows that remained on the air, including dramatic roles on such programs as Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar. After Jack Benny, Nelson continued to work in sitcoms in similar roles, most notably in The Hank McCune Show and I Love Lucy. Nelson appeared as various characters during all seasons of I Love Lucy (most notably game show host Freddie Fillmore) before beginning the recurring role as the character Ralph Ramsey, after the Ricardos moved to Westport, Connecticut in 1957. He further appeared in The New Phil Silvers ShowClassic TV Archive The New Phil Silvers Show (1963-64) and The Addams Family in the 1960s , and Sanford and Son during the 1970s.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M_2ZXWs55g =Later years and death= Toward the end of his life, Nelson enjoyed some newfound stardom among a younger generation of fans. From 1981 to 1986, he appeared in a string of popular commercials for McDonald's doing his trademark \\"EEE-Yeeeeeeeeesssss?\\" catchphrase, as part of the fast-food chain's highly successful \\"You Deserve a Break Today\\" vacation sweepstakes promotional campaign, in which he played an over-the-top passport agent. He also did a cameo appearance on the December 5, 1981 episode of Saturday Night Live as a newsstand vendor, when Tim Curry was the guest host. Garfield in Paradise, in 1986, was the last recorded time he used his signature phrase. In addition to his onscreen work, Nelson was an in- demand voiceover artist for animated cartoons. In 1954, he narrated Walter Lantz's cartoon short Dig That Dog. In television cartoons, he made several appearances on The Flintstones, Calvin and the Colonel, The Jetsons, and (as Governor Wetworth) on The Snorks, among other programs. Between 1978 and 1979, he provided the voice of Uncle Dudley on Dinky Dog. He also served as national president of AFTRA (a performers union) between 1954 and 1957. Nelson was not as prolific in motion pictures as he was in radio and television, but he occasionally appeared in variations of his oily clerk characterization. One of his larger roles is in Down Memory Lane (1949), in which he plays the apoplectic manager of a TV station. He also appears memorably in So You Want to Know Your Relatives, a Joe McDoakes spoof of This Is Your Life; Nelson plays the master of ceremonies, happily ushering unsavory guests onstage. Nelson was diagnosed with cancer during the late summer of 1985. After a year- long battle with the disease, he died in Hollywood on September 12, 1986 at the age of 75. He was entombed in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale. Nelson shares a columbarium niche with his longtime friend and fellow radio actor, Hanley Stafford, both men having been married to radio actress and singer Veola Vonn. Legacy His distinctive appearance and manner of saying \\"yes?\\" has been parodied frequently in film, radio and television, most notably with the character on The Simpsons called the \\"Frank Nelson Type\\" (aka \\"Yes Guy\\").Groening, Matt and McCann, Jesse L.: The Simpsons‚ÄîOne Step Beyond Forever, page 54. Nelson's appearance and mannerisms were also parodied multiple times in the Disney Afternoon series TaleSpin, with Nelson represented by a large hippopotamus in a suit. The Daily Show often featured a Nelson impression by host Jon Stewart after a setup clip, often \\"Yeeesss?\\" or \\"Go onnnnnnn ...\\" followed by another clip which serves as the punchline. He was also parodied in the Merrie Melodies cartoon \\"Canary Row\\".

Biography Crowther was born in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire. At the end of 1944, he moved to London with his parents, but was evacuated for a few months to the Isle of Bute until just after the Second World War ended.Bute's War bute- gateway.org. Retrieved 1 February 2008. Crowther's stage experience began in the mid-1940s. As a youngster he showed promise as a pianist, and in 1944 won a junior scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music. He attended the respected Cone-Ripman Drama School in London, where he met his future wife, and whilst there competed (in 1947) at the Star Junior Ballroom Championships partnering Pamela Cochran, and then at 16, he appeared as a member of the Ovaltineys Concert Party of the Air on Radio Luxembourg. He also attended Nottingham High School and then Thames Valley Grammar School. In November 1951 his mother died of a massive stroke aged 56. His father, Leslie Frederick Crowther, was also an actor. Leslie senior was an alcoholic, and died in early January 1955 at the age of 67, ten days after being hit by a car. Leslie junior had a half- brother, Frank Ronald, from his father's first marriage. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Crowther worked on the stage and on radio. His radio work included Ovaltine programmes, Variety Playhouse and Crowther's Crowd. Television career Crowther made a name for himself in television in the 1950s, with appearances as presenter of such programmes as the Billy Cotton Band Show and The Black and White Minstrel Show, and later the long-running children's institution Crackerjack (with Peter Glaze) for the BBC, from 1960 to 1968. In September 1967, Crowther was the presenter chosen to host the first series of the revamped children's favourites show, Junior Choice, on the newly opened Radio One station. The next year, 1968, he recorded the LP 'Songs for Swinging Children', released on Pye's blue Label. From 1964 to 1967, Crowther presented Meet the Kids, an annual trip to a children's hospital ward that was screened by the BBC on Christmas Morning. He would walk around the ward meeting the patients, and the show would feature a surprise celebrity, and a present hidden under each bed. Typical locations were Great Ormond Street or Hackney Hospitals. In 1969, Crowther switched to ITV, and A Merry Morning was screened annually, following the same format, usually from the Seacroft Hospital in Leeds. From the 1970s, Crowther was the face of Stork SB Margarine, for which he appeared in a number of television commercials. In 1971, he made The Leslie Crowther Show, a comedy sketch show, with three older comics, Arthur English, Chic Murray and Albert Modley (\\"Eee it's grand to be daft!\\") as the internal \\"rep\\" company. In 1972 and 1973, he appeared in a television sitcom called My Good Woman, alongside Richard Wilson, Sylvia Syms and Keith Barron. He also narrated two storytelling LPs for children, Tallulah Supercat and Tallulah and the Cat-Burglars. Crowther also appeared as Chesney Allen with Bernie Winters as Allen's partner Bud Flanagan in performances on television and on stage. In the middle of 1977, Crowther made an effort to break into radio with the pilot of a comedy show, It's Leslie, by Crowther, recorded in the Regent Sound Stage (now the Vue Cinema in Lower Regent Street) and produced by John Browell. This however did not come to anything and he returned to TV. =Game shows= Crowther was one of the many hosts of the ITV panel/game show Whose Baby? which he presented in the mid-1980s. He also presented the fifth series of Southern Television's children's game show Runaround in 1977, standing in for Mike Reid. He was also host of the first British version of the game show The Price is Right, from 1984 to 1988, during which time his \\"Come on down!\\" catchphrase became familiar. In 1994, Crowther said that when The Price is Right was axed in May 1988, the producers never bothered to contact him directly. Instead, he learned the news from the press who called at his house and asked him how he felt. In February 1990, he was chosen to be host of the TV show Stars in Their Eyes. The first episode was transmitted on 21 July 1990. Crowther hosted the first three series, and a Christmas special in 1991. At the time of his car crash in October 1992 he was booked to record an Elvis Presley special, which was then hosted by Russ Abbot, and a fourth series, eventually hosted by Matthew Kelly. 1992 car crash Crowther's show business career came to a sudden end on the afternoon of 3 October 1992 on the M5 near Cheltenham, when he sustained serious head injuries in a car crash which nearly killed him. The precise cause was never discovered. It was speculated that he fell asleep at the wheel and, as a result, his Silver Shadow Rolls-Royce car skidded into the central reservation barrier and overturned several times. In the months before the crash, Crowther was extremely busy with Lord's Taverners events and functions and on the previous day, 2 October, had been to a dinner in Swansea. That night he stayed at a hotel in Birmingham, and then opened Allied Carpets stores at Brierley Hill on the late morning of 3 October. Crowther was returning home when the crash occurred. The car ended up on its roof on the hard shoulder of the motorway, and was a write-off. At first Crowther did not appear to be seriously injured, apart from being shaken up. He was able to tell the police his personal details, including his home telephone number and what tablets he was taking for his heart condition and a faulty heart valve; he had been diagnosed with heart trouble three years earlier when he complained of feeling breathless. However, after being taken to Cheltenham General Hospital, his condition suddenly deteriorated and he lapsed into unconsciousness. A brain scan revealed a blood clot had formed on the left-hand side of his brain. Crowther was taken to Bristol's Frenchay Hospital for brain surgery to remove the blood clot that evening. On 5 October, after a nurse was unhappy with his condition, a further scan revealed that another blood clot, the size of a small apple, had formed on the same side of his brain, on his left frontal lobe this time. Crowther underwent a second brain operation that lasted two hours and a tracheotomy to help him breathe. Crowther remained in a coma for 17 days. He came home for the first time just before Christmas 1992. He was a patient in Frenchay Hospital until 12 February 1993 when he was discharged. After his release, he underwent months of occupational therapy and physiotherapy. Later career and retirement Crowther was appointed a CBE in the 1993 New Year's Honours list in recognition of his years of charity work and in July 1993 he went to Buckingham Palace to receive it. On 20 November 1993, he made his first TV appearance since his crash in the Royal Variety Performance, appearing alongside Cilla Black. On stage, he announced that he had just started to write an autobiography. Entitled The Bonus of Laughter, it was published in the autumn of 1994. On 6 October 1994, he and Matthew Kelly were interviewed together on This Morning. Crowther retired from show business on 4 November 1994, accepting that \\"I wouldn't be able to do things I've done the way I would want to, and the way my fans would expect\\". He also said that he was considering starting a new career as a writer. As he later put it, his mind was still sharp but his body had slowed down. Five days after retiring he appeared as the subject on This Is Your Life for the second time, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel during a book-signing session in Selfridges on London's Oxford Street. He had previously been honoured by This Is Your Life in March 1973 when Eamonn Andrews surprised him at an antiques fair at Earls Court in London. Two weeks after the second This Is Your Life tribute, Crowther appeared on the BBC's Invitation to Remember, in which he looked back on and reminisced about his career. Crowther's final television appearance was in March 1995, as a guest on June Whitfield's This Is Your Life episode. Personal life Like his father, Crowther was an alcoholic and this problem continued throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. On 14 November 1983, Crowther was arrested for drink-driving. Two weeks later he was fined, and banned from driving for nine months. This did not deter Crowther and in October 1988, he turned up at a gala in Glastonbury, drunk. This made him realise that he had a serious problem and needed help. Unlike five years earlier, his alcohol addiction received much publicity. From January to 17 March 1989, Crowther was a resident in Clouds House, a drug and alcohol treatment centre near Shaftesbury. He never drank alcohol again. Crowther married Jean Elizabeth Stone (12 May 1931 - 10 December 2017) on 27 March 1954. They had five children, including twins born on 9 December 1954; one of the twins, his daughter, Liz, is an actress. Another daughter, Caroline, was married to the musician Phil Lynott. Crowther's youngest child, Nick, works in radio, presenting traffic and travel bulletins for AA Roadwatch based in Stanmore. Death Crowther died from heart failure at 5am on 29 September 1996 in the Royal United Hospital in Bath, at the age of 63, with his wife Jean and family at his side. He had lived near Bath since 1978, and had a flat in London overlooking Lord's Cricket Ground. The 30 September 1996 episode of Bruce's Price Is Right, the Bruce Forsyth version of The Price is Right, was dedicated to Crowther at the request of Forsyth himself, according to the ITV continuity announcement. Forsyth told the Daily Mirror the previous day that Crowther had written to congratulate him on obtaining the job of presenting The Price is Right when it was relaunched on 4 September 1995. Crowther was cremated a week later, on 7 October. His ashes were later scattered at Lord's and a memorial service was held for him in London on 27 November. Also in October, at that year's National Television Awards, Matthew Kelly dedicated an award he won for Stars In Their Eyes to Crowther.

Born in New London, Connecticut, Hempstead was the delegate in the U.S. House for the Missouri Territory from 1812 to 1814. He served as territorial attorney general in Upper Louisiana and in the Missouri Territorial Legislature. Accident Hempstead was raised in Hebron, Connecticut, where he studied under Rev. Amos Basset. He studied law under Sylvester Gilbert when he was eighteen and was licensed in 1801. He practiced for a year in Middlesex, Connecticut, then two years in Newport, Rhode Island, then was admitted to the bar. He moved to Vincennes, Indiana Territory, in 1804. There, he befriended William Henry Harrison, and assisted with Harrison's government of the District of Louisiana. When Harrison was replaced with James Wilkinson, Hempstead resigned and moved to St. Louis. Hempstead later served with other Governors of the Louisiana and Missouri Territory, including attorney general. In 1812, the Territory of Missouri (renamed to avoid confusion with Louisiana) became entitled to a delegate to Congress. Hempstead was elected and served a two-year term, declining re-election.

It is three miles southwest of the Chicago Loop and its main neighborhood is Pilsen (). The Heart of Chicago is a neighborhood in the southwest corner of the Lower West Side. History In the late 19th century, Pilsen was inhabited by German, Polish, Italian, and Czech immigrants. Czech immigrants were the most prominent and named the district after Plze≈à, the fourth largest city in what is now the Czech Republic. They replaced the Germans and Irish who had settled there before them, in the mid-nineteenth century. These German and Irish residents lived in poor conditions throughout the 1850s and ‚Äò60s. The Pilsen area was overcrowded and suffered from flooding, lack of indoor plumbing, and illness. A cholera outbreak that killed hundreds, eventually led the German and Irish residents to move in search of better living conditions. The population also included smaller numbers of other ethnic groups from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, such as Slovaks, Slovenes, Croats and Austrians, as well as immigrants of Polish and Lithuanian heritage. Many of the immigrants worked in the stockyards and surrounding factories. Like many early 20th century American urban neighborhoods, however, Pilsen was home to both wealthy professionals and the working class, with the whole area knitted together based on the ethnicities, mostly of Slavic descent, who were not readily welcome in other areas of the city. Although there was some increase in the Hispanic presence in the late 1950s, it was not until the early 1960s that there was a great spurt in the numbers of Latinos in Pilsen. This was due to the displacement of Latinos from the neighborhood UIC currently occupies, south of Hull House, and from other urban revitalization projects. In 1970, Latinos became the majority population in Pilsen, with about 25,000 people out of the community's 43,341 people surpassing the population of people of Eastern European descent. In particular, Mexicans made up about 36% of the residents of Pilsen in 1973. In the 1980s, the Mexican-origin population grew. During that decade 95% of the people in Pilsen had some Mexican descent, and 80% of the overall population of Pilsen were first or second generation immigrants from Mexico and Mexican- Americans. Mexican growth continued into the 1990s. During that decade 40% of the Mexican-origin population in Pilsen had migrated directly there from Mexico, and about 33% of the Mexican-origin population in the Chicago area lived in Pilsen. As of 2005 many of the newer residents of the neighborhood were not Latino, and it is projected that the neighborhood will continue to become more diversified in the years ahead. The non-Latino population in Pilsen is still a minority as of the 2010 Census. The Chicago Housing Authority's plan for transformation of the ABLA projects has spilled over into Pilsen proper, with the now nearly complete Chantico Loft development, Union Row Townhomes, as well as the defunct Centro 18 on 18th Street in East Pilsen. Infill construction of condominiums and single-family homes is now in full force on the east side of the neighborhood, as Pilsen becomes one of the next major development areas for infill construction. Some local advocacy groups, including one led by Michael A. Martone, have formed urging the neighborhood's alderman to curtail gentrification to preserve the Mexican-American culture. Neighborhoods and sub-areas The Lower West Side includes two neighborhoods; Pilsen and Heart of Chicago. It also contains several areas considered to have historic significance including the Schoenhofen Brewery Historic District, part of the Cermak Road Bridge Historic District, and part of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal Historic District, and the South Water Market. =Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal Historic District= The Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal Historic District is part of the Illinois Waterway Navigation System Facilities multiple property submission; extends through Cook County west of Chicago, DuPage County and Will County to Lockport =Cermak Road Bridge Historic District= Cermak Road Bridge Historic District was added to the N.R.H.P. May 2012. It consists of Cermak Road and the South Branch of the Chicago River. =Heart of Chicago= According to the results of a 1978 survey which asked residents the name of their neighborhood and its boundaries, the approximate borders for the Heart of Chicago neighborhood are the BNSF Railway to the north, South Ashland Avenue to the east, Interstate 55 to the south, and South Western Avenue to the west. Along Oakley Boulevard, from 24th Street to 25th Street, is found a group of restaurants which remain as a residue of a previously large pocket of Northern Italians. In 1890, the McCormick Reaper factory at Western Avenue and the south branch of the river recruited skilled machine operators from Northern Provinces of Italy (Tuscany, Torino, Milano), offering them salaries twice that available in Italy and a paid transatlantic ship ticket. The community grew as workers paid for relatives to join them. St. Michael's parish on 25th street was their community center. The archdiocese closed that parish in 2000. {source: oral history of Franco the owner of La Fontanella, age ~75, taken 2019} Restaurants opened by these families that remain as of 2019 include on Oakley Boulevard: Bruna's (1933), Bacchanalia's (1971), La Fontanella (1974), Ignotz's (1999) and on Western Avenue Il Vicinato (1983). =Pilsen= The Pilsen neighborhood is a historically working class, residential neighborhood and gateway for immigrants coming to the City of Chicago. The area was initially settled by Czech immigrants to the United States who named the district after Plze≈à, a city in what is now the Czech Republic. According to the results of a 1978 survey which asked residents the name of their neighborhood and its boundaries, the approximate borders for Pilsen neighborhood are West 16th Street to the north, the Dan Ryan Expressway to the east, Interstate 55 to the south, and South Ashland Avenue to the west. In 2006, Pilsen Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. =Schoenhofen Brewery District= The Schoenhofen Brewery Historic District is centered on the former site of the Peter Schoenhofen Brewing Company at 18th and Canalport Avenue. Seventeen buildings once occupied the site when the brewery reached maximum capacity in 1910 at 1,200,000 barrels a year. Two of the remaining buildings demonstrate the change in architectural styles that occurred at the turn of the century in the United States. The facility also manufactured Green River. The brewery district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 27, 1978 and the Administration Building and Powerhouse were later designated Chicago Landmarks on July 13, 1988. =South Water Market= The South Water Market relocated to the Lower West Side in 1925. As of 2014, the five block facility had been redeveloped into the University Commons condominiums. Demographics According to a 2015 analysis by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, there were 34,410 people and 11,958 households on the Lower West Side. The racial makeup of the area was 13.4% White, 3.2% African American, 1.7% Asian, 1.1% from other races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 80.5% of the population. In the area, the population was spread out, with 27.4% under the age of 19, 30.8% from 20 to 34, 20.6% from 35 to 49, 12.9% from 50 to 64, and 8.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was ~30 years which is younger than the citywide median of ~34 years. Figures from the United States Census Bureau demonstrate a level of gentrification from 2000 to 2010. The Mexican American population, constant between 1970-1999, decreased significantly from 2000-2010. This loss was primarily in the Pilsen neighborhood. This change corresponded with a simultaneous decline of families and an increase in one person households. Families decreased by 20.4% and families with children decreased 40.9%. During the same period, single person households increased 17.8% Layout The east side of the neighborhood along Halsted Street is one of Chicago's largest art districts, and the neighborhood is also home to the National Museum of Mexican Art. St. Adalbert's dominates the skyline with the opulence typical of churches in the Polish Cathedral style. Pilsen is home to a multitude of murals and other forms of street art. With an initiative from the Chicago Urban Art Society and support from the National Museum of Mexican Art artists have been able to construct murals around the Pilsen neighborhood, adding to the history, culture, and community of the area. West 18th Street is an active commercial corridor, with Mexican bakeries, restaurants, and groceries, though the principal district for Mexican shopping is W 26th Street in Little Village, Chicago's other formerly majority Pan-Slavic community. The United States Postal Service operates the Pilsen Post Office on 1859 S Ashland Avenue. The National Museum of Mexican Art is located in the Pilsen neighborhood. Podmajersky incorporated is a major property owner in the Pilsen area.  Street art  Mexican dancers in Pilsen in 2006 The Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago has become a hub for muralists and street artists to convey their identity, passion, and activism. Murals are historically connected to Mayan and Aztec cultures which have influenced Mexican artists from the 1920s-present day. Mario Castillo painted Peace or Metafisico in 1968. This piece was the first Mexican and anti-Vietnam War murals in Pilsen. In 1969, he painted The Wall of Brotherhood which was inspired by an artwork located in the Bronzeville neighborhood. Some murals have remained the same or have been updated throughout the years and others have been modified to portray current events. In 1980, Marcos Raya created Fallen Dictator which portrays an anti-war and anti-imperialist message. This particular mural has been redone three times. The most recent update has images of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton drawn as snakes and battling each other. In 2016, Sam Kirk and Sandra Atongiori created Weaving Cultures to highlight women of different backgrounds. The mural paints five different women, including a transgender Latina, with the goal of representing women of all demographics and promote acceptance of others. Cuisine Robb Walsh of the Houston Press wrote that the Mexican restaurants in Pilsen are \\"unconsciously authentic\\" to original Mexican cuisine. According to Rick Bayless, the chef and owner of Frontera Grill, this is because Mexican- Americans in Chicago do not encounter a substantial Chicano community in the United States that prefers a Tex Mex-style of cuisine, so the immigrants use the same frame of reference that they had in Mexico. Transportation A retired 4400-series TMC RTS bus in the Pilsen neighborhood in May 2008 Public transit on the Lower West Side is provided by the Chicago Transit Authority and Metra. The Pink Line, part of the CTA's Chicago \\"L\\" train system, has three stops on the Lower West Side; the Western station, the Damen station, and the 18th Street station. The Orange Line has a single station, Ashland station, on the Lower West Side, but its ridership is primarily from neighboring Bridgeport and McKinley Park. The BNSF Railway has two stations on the Lower West Side; Halsted Street/U.I.C. station and Western Avenue station. The CTA also operates 8 bus routes that go through the neighborhood; 9 Ashland, X9 Ashland express, 18 16th/18th, 21 Cermak, 50 Damen, 49 Western, X49 Western Express, and 60 Blue Island/26th. Routes 8 Halsted and 12 Roosevelt skirt the neighborhood too. The Stevenson Expressway has exits at Damen Avenue and Ashland Avenue on the Lower West Side. The Canal Street railroad bridge, a Chicago landmark, is located on the Lower West Side. There are also bikeways on Blue Island Avenue, 18th, and Halsted Streets. Politics In the 2016 presidential election, the Lower West Side cast 9,792 votes for Democrat Hillary Clinton and cast 715 votes for Republican Donald Trump. In the 2012 presidential election, the Lower West Side cast 14,028 votes for Democrat Barack Obama and 4,989 votes for Republican Mitt Romney. At the local level, the Lower West Side is located in the 25th ward, which is represented on the Chicago City Council by Alderman Daniel Solis. Solis is also the ward‚Äôs Democratic Committeemen. His Republican counterpart is Martin Ozinga. In the United States House of Representatives, the Lower West Side is located in Illinois's 4th congressional district represented by Democrat Chuy Garc√≠a. In the Illinois General Assembly, the Lower West Side is in the 1st Legislative District, represented by Democrat Tony Munoz in the Illinois Senate, and the 2nd House district, represented by Democrat Theresa Mah in the Illinois House of Representatives. Education Residents are zoned to Chicago Public Schools. Benito Juarez Community Academy, located in the Lower West Side, serves much of it. Other parts are zoned to Thomas Kelly High School.\\"West/Central/South High Schools\\" (). Chicago Public Schools. May 17, 2013. Retrieved on May 25, 2015.

Walsh Elementary School =History of education= Prior to the 1970s, Pilsen residents attended Jungman Elementary School for grades 1-6; Cooper School, adjacent to Jungman, for grades 7-8; Froebel School for grades 9-10, and Harrison Technical High School in South Lawndale for grades 11-12. Jungman opened in 1903. In 1914 an addition was installed. The building was converted into a junior high school in 1933 due to a decision by the Chicago Board of Education. It later became a branch of Harrison Tech, and then in 1947 a branch of Walsh Elementary. Froebel served as a branch for Harrison Tech due to overcrowding on the main campus; it was originally an elementary school. Teresa Fraga, Mary Gonzales and Raquel Guerrero are the three founding mothers of Benito Juarez Community High School. In the late 1960s, the three mothers shared concerns for their own children when the only public high school available was Harrison High school. Harrison High School was located in a neighborhood plagued with gang territory and racial tension between African Americans and Mexican Americans. The mothers wanted a safe and conducive school for Spanish speaking students. The school was proposed to Chicago‚Äôs Board of Education multiple times but ultimately rejected. This led to protests and boycotts from many Mexican students and families. Finally, in June 1974, Chicago‚Äôs Board of Education approved $8.9 million in funding to build a high school in Pilsen. Benito Juarez Community Academy opened in 1977 and now has a 94 percent Latino student body. The school is decorated with murals and statues that portray Mexican culture and famous leaders such as Benito Jaurez.

LeBow stated that the reason for the settlement was to obtain immunity for Liggett from future liabilities and to prevent a future bankruptcy.Inside the Tobacco Deal: Bennet LeBow Profile PBS Frontline The settlement entailed that Liggett agree to pay $1 million in damages; publicly announce that smoking is addictive and causes cancer; turn over long-secret tobacco industry documents; disclose ingredients in its cigarettes; and testify against the industry. Liggett was the first cigarette company to voluntarily put the label \\"Nicotine is Addictive\\" on their product. LeBow's actions were pivotal to the government in their signing of the Master Settlement Agreement.

Biography He was born in Blue Rapids, Kansas on April 19, 1891. Fulton made his professional debut in 1913 and did not retire from boxing until 1933. Fulton began his boxing career in the early twentieth century. His final record was 83 wins (72 by KO), 17 losses and 4 draws. In 2003 he was named to Ring magazine's' list of 100 greatest punchers of all time. Fulton, although possessing a strong punch, had a checkered career against the other fighters of the era, and never landed a title fight. He did defeat Gunboat Smith, considered the best of the heavyweight contenders, on two occasions; by TKO on November 27, 1917, and by 2-round KO on April 7, 1920. Fulton was defeated by other Carl Morris by disqualification on April 3, 1914, Al Palzer by 4-round KO on May 22, 1914, and Arthur Pelkey by 5-round KO on October 28, 1915. Fulton's dreams of obtaining a title fight were dashed when he was KO'ed by Jack Dempsey in 18.6 seconds of the first round on July 27, 1918, and by Harry Wills in 3 rounds on July 26, 1920.

It was developed by Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, and is built on a core of adaptively-sampled distance field (ADF) technology. Saffron has been licensed to Adobe and Monotype and is shipping in numerous products such as the Adobe Flash Player and Amazon Kindle. Saffron has been implemented in both software and hardware. Principles = Antialiasing = Saffron performs anti-aliasing by first computing an explicit or implicit adaptively-sampled distance field (ADF) and then mapping distance values to densities. This renders beautiful curves, captures small details, and preserves the nuances of the original font design. Although only one distance sample is needed per pixel to achieve high-quality results, the program can use up to 3 samples per pixel to optimize image quality for LCD displays. The computation of a distance sample requires only linear interpolation and can be updated incrementally from pixel to pixel, thereby making the rendering process simple and efficient. For a more comprehensive treatment of distance-based anti-aliasing, see \\"A New Framework for Representing, Rendering, Editing, and Animating Type\\", Ronald N. Perry and Sarah F. Frisken, MERL, 2002. = Explicit and implicit ADFs = Saffron supports two types of ADFs for representing glyphs: explicit ADFs and implicit ADFs. A compile time flag controls the selection of which ADF type to use throughout the system. Explicit ADF generation uses top-down spatial subdivision to generate a spatial hierarchy of explicit ADF cells, where each explicit ADF cell contains a set of sampled distance values and a reconstruction method; explicit ADF rendering reconstructs the distance field within each explicit ADF cell using its reconstruction method and then maps the reconstructed distances to density values. In contrast, implicit ADF cells are not generated initially, but are generated on-demand during rendering. More specifically, implicit ADF generation preprocesses an ADFPath (which represents a glyph); it generates implicit ADF cells from the preprocessed ADFPath and renders each implicit ADF cell by first reconstructing the distance field within the implicit ADF cell using its reconstruction method and then mapping the reconstructed distances to density values. Specific features = Math modes = The Saffron library offers both floating-point and fixed-point implementations of the renderer with identical image quality. The fixed-point implementation is ideal for embedded systems and mobile devices, which often lack floating-point hardware. = Glyph formats = The program supports traditional outline-based fonts, uniform-width stroke-based fonts, and Stylized Stroke Fonts (SSFs). Stroke-based fonts are useful for memory-constrained applications (e.g., embedded systems) because they occupy a much smaller footprint than outline-based fonts and are also faster to render. For example, outline-based fonts containing the GB2312 character set often require well over 3 MB of storage, whereas the same character set can be represented compactly in a stroke-based font with only 250 KB. However, since each stroke has a uniform width, USFs lack the expressiveness and the cultural acceptance of their outline-based counterparts. Saffron supports an improved representation for stroke-based fonts called Stylized Stroke Fonts (SSFs) which provide the expressiveness of traditional outline-based fonts and the small memory footprint of USFs. For details, see ‚ÄúAn Improved Representation for Stroke-based Fonts‚Äù, SIGGRAPH 2006 Conference Abstracts and Applications, Elena J. Jakubiak, Ronald N. Perry, and Sarah F. Frisken. = Grid fitting = Saffron features an automatic grid fitting system that aligns strong vertical and horizontal edges of glyphs to the pixel grid or to the sub-pixel grid. This grid fitting system provides better contrast, uniform stroke weights, and consistent characteristic distances. Standard Alignment Zones (SAZ) currently support several alphabets, including Arabic, Devanagari, Hebrew, Latin, and Thai. The SAZ grid fitting system requires no changes to existing typefaces and is particularly advantageous when hints are unavailable or have been removed to save space. Unhinted fonts typically occupy significantly less space than their hinted counterparts. Saffron also features an automatic Multiple Alignment Zone (MAZ) grid fitting system, which is optimized specifically for Asian character sets such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. MAZ grid fitting leads to dramatic improvements in rendering quality. The MAZ grid fitting system detects strong horizontal and vertical edges and aligns them to the pixel grid. The MAZ algorithms work with both outline-based fonts and stroke-based fonts, run dynamically during rendering, and operate fully automatically with no user parameters required. The program fully supports application-hinted glyphs, allowing applications to override Saffron's automatic grid fitting algorithms by using their own hints (e.g., TrueType hints) to perform grid fitting. = Character simplification = Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters often contain many strokes which are difficult to render distinctly at small sizes. Simply aligning horizontal and vertical strokes to the pixel grid (e.g., by rounding each stroke to the nearest grid point) is not sufficient to produce a clear image. Saffron's MAZ grid fitting system performs character simplification (as needed) to ensure that each character remains clear and legible, even at small sizes. = Sub-pixel rendering = The program supports sub-pixel rendering to optimize image quality for LCD displays. Although RGB vertical striped arrays are common, Saffron can also render to alternative pixel patterns such as RGB delta arrays, which are often used on digital camera LCDs. In addition, prototype implementations of Saffron are optimized for Clairvoyante's PenTile patterns. During sub-pixel rendering, the program reduces color fringing artifacts that would otherwise be visible at small sizes. = Continuous stroke modulation = Saffron exploits the inherent properties of distance fields to provide continuous stroke modulation (CSM), the continuous modulation of both stroke weight and edge sharpness. This allows users to tune the appearance of text to suit individual preference. For example, sharper, softer, thinner, and thicker versions of the same typeface can be rendered by using different CSM parameters.

Informally, this means that if G acts unitarily on a Hilbert space and has \\"almost invariant vectors\\", then it has a nonzero invariant vector. The formal definition, introduced by David Kazhdan (1967), gives this a precise, quantitative meaning. Although originally defined in terms of irreducible representations, property (T) can often be checked even when there is little or no explicit knowledge of the unitary dual. Property (T) has important applications to group representation theory, lattices in algebraic groups over local fields, ergodic theory, geometric group theory, expanders, operator algebras and the theory of networks. Definitions Let G be a œÉ-compact, locally compact topological group and œÄ : G ‚Üí U(H) a unitary representation of G on a (complex) Hilbert space H. If Œµ > 0 and K is a compact subset of G, then a unit vector Œæ in H is called an (Œµ, K)-invariant vector if : \\\\forall g \\\\in K \\\\ : \\\\ \\\\left \\\\\\\\pi(g) \\\\xi - \\\\xi \\\\right \\\\ < \\\\varepsilon. The following conditions on G are all equivalent to G having property (T) of Kazhdan, and any of them can be used as the definition of property (T). (1) The trivial representation is an isolated point of the unitary dual of G with Fell topology. (2) Any sequence of continuous positive definite functions on G converging to 1 uniformly on compact subsets, converges to 1 uniformly on G. (3) Every unitary representation of G that has an (Œµ, K)-invariant unit vector for any Œµ > 0 and any compact subset K, has a non-zero invariant vector. (4) There exists an Œµ > 0 and a compact subset K of G such that every unitary representation of G that has an (Œµ, K)-invariant unit vector, has a nonzero invariant vector. (5) Every continuous affine isometric action of G on a real Hilbert space has a fixed point (property (FH)). If H is a closed subgroup of G, the pair (G,H) is said to have relative property (T) of Margulis if there exists an Œµ > 0 and a compact subset K of G such that whenever a unitary representation of G has an (Œµ, K)-invariant unit vector, then it has a non-zero vector fixed by H.  Discussion  Definition (4) evidently implies definition (3). To show the converse, let G be a locally compact group satisfying (3), assume by contradiction that for every K and Œµ there is a unitary representation that has a (K, Œµ)-invariant unit vector and does not have an invariant vector. Look at the direct sum of all such representation and that will negate (4). The equivalence of (4) and (5) (Property (FH)) is the Delorme-Guichardet theorem. The fact that (5) implies (4) requires the assumption that G is œÉ-compact (and locally compact) (Bekka et al., Theorem 2.12.4).  General properties  * Property (T) is preserved under quotients: if G has property (T) and H is a quotient group of G then H has property (T). Equivalently, if a homomorphic image of a group G does not have property (T) then G itself does not have property (T). * If G has property (T) then G/[G, G] is compact. * Any countable discrete group with property (T) is finitely generated. * An amenable group which has property (T) is necessarily compact. Amenability and property (T) are in a rough sense opposite: they make almost invariant vectors easy or hard to find. * Kazhdan's theorem: If Œì is a lattice in a Lie group G then Œì has property (T) if and only if G has property (T). Thus for n ‚â• 3, the special linear group SL(n, Z) has property (T). Examples * Compact topological groups have property (T). In particular, the circle group, the additive group Zp of p-adic integers, compact special unitary groups SU(n) and all finite groups have property (T). * Simple real Lie groups of real rank at least two have property (T). This family of groups includes the special linear groups SL(n, R) for n ‚â• 3 and the special orthogonal groups SO(p,q) for p > q ‚â• 2 and SO(p,p) for p ‚â• 3. More generally, this holds for simple algebraic groups of rank at least two over a local field. * The pairs (Rn ‚ãä SL(n, R), Rn) and (Zn ‚ãä SL(n, Z), Zn) have relative property (T) for n ‚â• 2. * For n ‚â• 2, the noncompact Lie group Sp(n, 1) of isometries of a quaternionic hermitian form of signature (n,1) is a simple Lie group of real rank 1 that has property (T). By Kazhdan's theorem, lattices in this group have property (T). This construction is significant because these lattices are hyperbolic groups; thus, there are groups that are hyperbolic and have property (T). Explicit examples of groups in this category are provided by arithmetic lattices in Sp(n, 1) and certain quaternionic reflection groups. Examples of groups that do not have property (T) include * The additive groups of integers Z, of real numbers R and of p-adic numbers Qp. * The special linear groups SL(2, Z) and SL(2, R), as a result of the existence of complementary series representations near the trivial representation, although SL(2,Z) has property (œÑ) with respect to principal congruence subgroups, by Selberg's theorem. * Noncompact solvable groups. * Nontrivial free groups and free abelian groups. Discrete groups Historically property (T) was established for discrete groups Œì by embedding them as lattices in real or p-adic Lie groups with property (T). There are now several direct methods available. *The algebraic method of Shalom applies when Œì = SL(n, R) with R a ring and n ‚â• 3; the method relies on the fact that Œì can be boundedly generated, i.e. can be expressed as a finite product of easier subgroups, such as the elementary subgroups consisting of matrices differing from the identity matrix in one given off-diagonal position. *The geometric method has its origins in ideas of Garland, Gromov and Pierre Pansu. Its simplest combinatorial version is due to Zuk: let Œì be a discrete group generated by a finite subset S, closed under taking inverses and not containing the identity, and define a finite graph with vertices S and an edge between g and h whenever g‚àí1h lies in S. If this graph is connected and the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the corresponding simple random walk is greater than ¬Ω, then Œì has property (T). A more general geometric version, due to Zuk and , states that if a discrete group Œì acts properly discontinuously and cocompactly on a contractible 2-dimensional simplicial complex with the same graph theoretic conditions placed on the link at each vertex, then Œì has property (T). Many new examples of hyperbolic groups with property (T) can be exhibited using this method. *The computer- assisted method is based on a suggestion by Narutaka Ozawa and has been successfully implemented by several researchers. It is based on the algebraic characterization of property (T) in terms of an inequality in the real group algebra, for which a solution may be found by solving a semidefinite programming problem numerically on a computer. Notably, this method has confirmed property (T) for the automorphism group of the free group of rank at least 5. No human proof is known for this result.  Applications  *Grigory Margulis used the fact that SL(n, Z) (for n ‚â• 3) has property (T) to construct explicit families of expanding graphs, that is, graphs with the property that every subset has a uniformly large \\"boundary\\". This connection led to a number of recent studies giving an explicit estimate of Kazhdan constants, quantifying property (T) for a particular group and a generating set. *Alain Connes used discrete groups with property (T) to find examples of type II1 factors with countable fundamental group, so in particular not the whole of positive reals ‚Ñù+. Sorin Popa subsequently used relative property (T) for discrete groups to produce a type II1 factor with trivial fundamental group. *Groups with property (T) lead to good mixing properties in ergodic theory: again informally, a process which mixes slowly leaves some subsets almost invariant. *Similarly, groups with property (T) can be used to construct finite sets of invertible matrices which can efficiently approximate any given invertible matrix, in the sense that every matrix can be approximated, to a high degree of accuracy, by a finite product of matrices in the list or their inverses, so that the number of matrices needed is proportional to the number of significant digits in the approximation. *Groups with property (T) also have Serre's property FA. *Toshikazu Sunada observed that the positivity of the bottom of the spectrum of a \\"twisted\\" Laplacian on a closed manifold is related to property (T) of the fundamental group. This observation yields Brooks' result which says that the bottom of the spectrum of the Laplacian on the universal covering manifold over a closed Riemannian manifold M equals zero if and only if the fundamental group of M is amenable.

Born in Los Angeles, Schemel was raised in rural Marysville, Washington, where she developed an interest in punk rock music as a teenager. She began drumming at age eleven, and while in high school, formed several bands with her brother, Larry. Schemel was recommended as a drummer to Hole frontwoman Courtney Love by her husband, Kurt Cobain, a friend of Schemel's. She formally joined the band in 1992, and performed on their critically acclaimed second album, Live Through This (1994). On the band's third release, Celebrity Skin (1998), Schemel was replaced by a session drummer after its producer, Michael Beinhorn, convinced Love that Schemel was unable to adequately perform during their recording sessions. Though she receives credit on the album, her drumming does not appear on the final tracks, and the event marked her departure from the band. For the band's subsequent tour, Schemel was replaced by Samantha Maloney. After leaving Hole, Schemel developed a significant crack cocaine addiction, and was homeless for a time. In the early 2000s, she became sober and reunited with Love, joining the short-lived group Bastard before drumming on Love's debut solo album, America's Sweetheart (2004). Schemel subsequently drummed for Juliette and the Licks, appearing on their EP ...Like a Bolt of Lightning (2004). In 2010, using concert and video diary footage from Hole's 1994‚Äì1995 Live Through This world tour, Schemel co-created Hit So Hard, a documentary chronicling her time in Hole, her overcoming substance abuse, as well her subsequent business operating a dog boarding business. In 2013, she joined the indie rock group Upset, formed by Ali Koehler, previously of Vivian Girls and Best Coast, and formed the band Death Valley Girls with her brother, Larry, the same year. Life and career =1967‚Äì1986: Early life= Patricia Theresa Schemel was born April 24, 1967 in Los Angeles, California. She is the middle child of three children and grew up in Marysville, Washington. Both her parents are natives of Brooklyn, New York, and relocated to Washington state shortly after Schemel's birth. Schemel began playing drums at age eleven after her father bought her a drum set, and played music with her brother Larry, who played guitar. As a teenager, Schemel came out as a lesbian to her family. \\"When I realized I was a lesbian, it was weird,\\" Schemel reflected. \\"Thank god for punk and rock music. You could be whoever you wanted.\\" Musically, Schemel's early influences included Echo & the Bunnymen, AC/DC and Wire, among other punk rock bands. Schemel recalled being one of a small number of peers in her high school who had a shared interest in punk rock music. At age fifteen formed her first band, The Milkbones. She and her brother Larry subsequently formed the Seattle punk band Sybil, which was renamed Kill Sybil due to the artist of the same name. =1987‚Äì1991: Early projects= In 1987, she joined Doll Squad, an all-female punk rock band from Seattle. Along with bassist Annette Billesbach, lead guitarist Cathy Watson, rhythm guitarist Helen Halloran and vocalist Mara Dralle, Schemel was one of the original members of Doll Squad before their 2008 reunion. The band was initially active from 1987 to 1989 gaining an indie following in Seattle, playing alongside Nirvana, and releasing one self-released demo tape. Between Kill Sybil and Doll Squad, Schemel played drums for Everett, Washington-based band The Primitives with poet Raegan Butcher and local performers Danny Darst and Tommy Suzuki. =1992‚Äì1997: Hole= Schemel was considered by Kurt Cobain as Nirvana's drummer after the departure of their drummer, Chad Channing.Love, Courtney. Interview with Kurt Loder for MTV's Courtney Love: The Hole Story, September 1, 1994. Cobain had been a fan of Schemel's former band Sybil, which had also been based in Seattle. However, after Dave Grohl's audition, Schemel became Cobain's second choice, and he and Schemel developed a close friendship. After the departure of Hole's original drummer Caroline Rue, frontwoman Courtney Love recruited Schemel at the suggestion of Cobain; after an audition in Los Angeles which impressed Love and guitarist Eric Erlandson, Schemel was asked to join the band in 1992. Schemel's first work with Hole was the recording of their fourth single, \\"Beautiful Son\\", on which she also played guitar on the b-side \\"20 Years in the Dakota\\", with Love playing bass. During this period, Schemel had developed an addiction to heroin, and refused to be part of close friend Kurt Cobain's drug intervention in March 1994, claiming that doing so would be hypocrisy, as she \\"was strung out [...] how dare I go there and say anything about someone else's abuse when I'm doing it too.\\"Schemel, Patty. Interview with VH1 for Behind the Music: Courtney Love, 2010. Schemel played drums on Hole's second critically acclaimed album, Live Through This (1994). She went on to tour with the band for the promotion of Live Through This, which featured dates at the Reading Festival, Big Day Out and Lollapalooza. While on tour in April 1995, Schemel became the first woman ever to appear on the cover of Drum World magazine. Schemel publicly came out in a 1995 band interview with Rolling Stone, commenting: \\"It's important\\" and that she's \\"not out there with that fucking pink flag or anything but it's good for other people who live somewhere else in some small town who feel freaky about being gay to know that there's other people who are and that it's OK.\\"Rolling Stone Magazine issue # 715, August 1995 Schemel's girlfriend, Stacey, at the time worked as Courtney Love's personal assistant during Hole's 1994‚Äì1995 world tour, while promoting Live Through This. Around this time, she also recorded with Phranc, playing drums on the 1995 Goofyfoot EP. In 1996, Schemel played drums on Hole's cover of Fleetwood Mac's song \\"Gold Dust Woman\\", which was the first song on the soundtrack to The Crow: City of Angels. She also sang backing vocals and appeared prominently in the video for the song. During this time, Schemel and Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur formed a short-lived side project called Constant Comment. The band played a small number of shows before disbanding. Hole became active again in 1997 and entered the studio to record Celebrity Skin (1998), the follow-up to Live Through This. Schemel worked on the writing of the album's material, and composed all of the drum parts herself. While in the studio, however, Love and Erlandson, at the insistence of producer Michael Beinhorn, suggested using a session drummer to record the drum tracks for the album. This led to Schemel voluntarily leaving the studio and quitting the band, and the final drum tracks were recorded by a session drummer provided by producer Beinhorn. In the months following the album's release, Schemel was not present in band interviews, and was eventually replaced by Samantha Maloney for the album's tour. However, due to her contribution to the writing of the album and its demos, Schemel's name and photo were still included on the album sleeve. =1998‚Äì2000: Departure from Hole and aftermath= Reasons for Schemel's departure from Hole were disputed at the time, with Love claiming that Schemel's then drug habit was to blame, which supported circulating rumours,\\"Rumors are swirling about the status and sobriety of drummer Patty Schemel. At press time, the only semi-official comment is that Schemel is 'on vacation' and will not appear in the video for 'Celebrity Skin.'\\" From a 1998 article entitled FEATURED SOUNDBYTE: HOLE: THE CELEBRITY SKINNY. however, Schemel insisted it was due to \\"musical differences.\\" It was later revealed in 2011 that Schemel left Hole due to personal and musical differences between her and Celebrity Skin producer, Michael Beinhorn. She claimed that Beinhorn was \\"totally psyching [her] out in the studio\\" and after a meeting with the band, Beinhorn brought in a session drummer, to which she felt \\"betrayed by the band.\\" Bandmates Courtney Love and Eric Erlandson later publicly expressed regret over the decision to replace Schemel on the album's studio work, and Love referred to Beinhorn as \\"a Nazi\\". Melissa Auf der Maur also commented on the incident, but noted that she \\"didn't have much of a say in it.\\" After quitting Hole in 1998, Schemel cut off contact with her family and friends, and became addicted to crack cocaine and was homeless for over a year. According to Courtney Love, Schemel contacted her asking for money, which Love provided, but only under the condition that she would attend rehab. By 2001, Schemel had attended rehab and achieved sobriety. =2001‚Äìpresent: Subsequent projects= After overcoming her addiction, Schemel reunited with Love for Love's short-lived project Bastard, which included Veruca Salt's Louise Post on guitar and Gina Crosley of Rockit Girl. The group, though they recorded a few demos, disbanded shortly after. In 2002, Schemel served as a drummer for the experimental group Lucid Nation, and recorded drums for their album Tacoma Ballet (2002). The following year, Schemel, along with her brother Larry, subsequently served as key composers and performers on Courtney Love's debut solo album, America's Sweetheart (2004). She also recorded with Juliette Lewis's punk rock band Juliette and the Licks, with whom she played drums on their debut 6 song EP ...Like a Bolt of Lightning (2004). Schemel (center) performing with mid-1990s Hole lineup, 2012 On March 18, 2010, Schemel appeared in bonus footage for the VH1 program Sober House with Dr. Drew discussing her addiction and sobriety. She also took part in the MusiCares MAP Fund benefit concert in 2010, which is focused on women's recovery from drug addiction to sobriety. In 2011, Schemel was the subject of the documentary film Hit So Hard, directed by P. David Ebersole, which chronicles her early life, time in Hole, overcoming substance abuse, and life after quitting Hole. The documentary includes interviews with the band, as well as home video footage recorded by Schemel, chronicling Hole's 1994‚Äì1995 Live Through This Tour. The film premiered in New York at The Museum of Modern Art in March 2011 as part of the New Directors/New Films Festival, reuniting the classic Hole line-up in the same room for the first time in thirteen years. Hit So Hard was also the Documentary Centerpiece at Outfest in Los Angeles in June 2011 and was released theatrically and on home video in 2012. In April 2012, Schemel joined former Hole bandmates Melissa Auf der Maur, Courtney Love, and Eric Erlandson for a reunion performance at the Public Assembly in Brooklyn, New York following a screening of Hit So Hard. In January 2013, Schemel joined the group Upset with Ali Koehler. The same year, she formed the garage rock bad Death Valley Girls with her brother, Larry. Schemel published an autobiography, also titled Hit So Hard:A Memoir, in 2017 through Da Capo Press. The book was praised for its candor, honesty and humor. In dealing with topics such as fame, addiction, coming out and more. The following year, Schemel appeared as a drummer on Marissa Nadler's eighth studio album, For My Crimes (2018). In 2019 Patty recorded a record with Upset produced by Steven McDonald of Redd Kross.

The Atlantic coast, however, was left largely unexplored by Spanish settlers until the 19th century. As early as 1569, Governor Peraf√°n de Rivera gave extensive plots of land, Indians included, in Matina to aristocrats (hidalgos) that helped to finance and support early conquest. Because these aristocrats found out that only a few Indians were available to exploit, they acquired African slaves to plant these lands with cocoa trees (the only feasible crop in these lands). These lands provided the only source of income to the absentee owners from the capital city of Cartago. Matina gained importance because of the cacao and the presence of African slaves, which made them attractive to pirate incursions. Notorious pirates, Edward Mansvelt and his vice admiral Henry Morgan, arrived at Portete, a small bay between Lim√≥n and Mo√≠n, in 1666. They proceeded inland to Cartago, the capital of Costa Rica at the time, but were driven away by the inhabitants at Turrialba on 15 April. The pirate army left on 16 April and arrived back in Portete on 23 April. They left Costa Rica and did not return.Cr√≥nicas Coloniales Ricardo Fern√°ndez Guardia, 1921. portlimon.com. =Founding= The town was officially founded in 1854 by Philipp J. J. Valentini under government auspices.Encyclopedia Americana (1918‚Äì1920), Vol. XXVII, pp. 645‚Äì46 online version at Internet Archive (last viewed 24 May 2011) In 1867, construction began on an ambitious railroad connecting the highlands to the sea. Lim√≥n was chosen as the site of a major port, which would facilitate exports of the coffee from the Central Valley. =Recent history= As a district Lim√≥n was last modified on 10 August 1992 by Decreto Ejecutivo 21515-G. Puerto Lim√≥n was struck by the 1991 Limon earthquake, which affected the surrounding landscape and coastline. Demographics For the 2011 census, Lim√≥n had a population of inhabitants. =Afro-Costa Rican= The first officially acknowledged arrival of African people who arrived in Costa Rica came with the Spanish conquistadors. Slave trade was common in all the countries conquered by Spain, and in Costa Rica the first Africans seem to have come from specific sources in Africa- Equatorial and Western regions. The people from these areas were thought of as ideal slaves because they had a reputation for being more robust, affable and hard-working than other Africans. The enslaved were from what is now the Gambia (Wolof), Guinea (Malink√©), Ghanaian (Ashanti), Benin (specifically Ije / Arar√°s) and Sudan (Puras). Many of the enslaved were also Minas (i.e. communities from parts of the region extending from Ivory Coast to the Slave Coast), Popo (be imported tribes as Ana and Baribas), Yorubas and Congas (perhaps from Kongasso, Ivory Coast). Enslaved Africans also came from other places, such as neighboring Panama. Throughout the centuries, but especially after the emancipation of the slaves in 1824, the black population mixed with other ethnic groups, notably the Indians, and became part of the mainstream culture and ethnicity. The early black population of Matina and Suerre in Lim√≥n is not the same population that arrived in the second half of the 19th century. This latter population did not arrive as slaves but as hired workers from Jamaica, and smaller groups from Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. This is the reason why the majority of the current black population of Costa Rica has English surnames and speak English with a Jamaican accent. In 1910, Marcus Mosiah Garvey travelled to Puerto Lim√≥n, where he worked as a time-keeper for the United Fruit Company for some months, observing that the population of African descent suffered poor conditions.Marcus Garvey in Port Limon portlimon.com. The descendant of Africans in Costa Rica have endured discrimination including a delay in voting rights and a restriction on their movements. Celebrations Puerto Lim√≥n is famous in Costa Rica for its yearly fall festival called carnaval which occurs the week of 12 October, the date Columbus first anchored off Lim√≥n's coast in 1502, on his fourth voyage. The event was started by local community leader and activist, Alfred Josiah Henry Smith (known as \\"Mister King\\"), who helped organize the first carnaval in October 1949.Lim√≥n despidi√≥ a su Mister King con respeto y carnaval The event stretches about a week (across two weekends), and includes a parade, food, music, dancing, and, on the last night, a concert in the Parque Vargas headlined by a major Latino or Caribbean music act.

Given the severity of the situation, the city bought land in nearby Santa Rosa and, in April 2009, opened its own landfill (called El Tomatal). Given the improved situation, carnaval picked up in 2009 after its two-year hiatus. Climate Lim√≥n features a trade-wind tropical rainforest climate under K√∂ppen's climate classification.
